REPORT OF THE COITNCIL.

Report of the Council for the year 1890-91, fresented to the General
                Committee at Cardiff, on Wednesday, August 19, 1891.

^ The Council have received the usual Financial Reports from the
 General Treasurer, during the past year, and his account for the year

 1890-91, which was audited on the 31st July will be presented to the
 General Committee

      The Council were informed by Dr. Williamson in the early part of the
 year that he would be unable to allow himself to be nominated to the
 office of General Treasurer at the present meeting of the Association, and
 that, as he would not be able to attend the meeting at Cardiff, he
 wished to continue in office only until the commencement of that

 meeting.

      Dr. Williamson was appointed to succeed Mr. Spottiswoode in the
 year 1874, and during this long period of seventeen years his wise and
 calm judgment has afforded the Council, on all occasions of difficulty,
 most valuable assistance.

      The Council recommend that, in accordance with the wish expressed

 by Dr. Williamson, a successor to his office be appointed at this meeting,

 and they have much pleasure in recommending to the General Committee

 that Professor Arthur W. Riicker, M.A., F.R.S., be elected General

 Treasurer, and that he be requested to enter at once upon the duties of

 the office.

      Lord Rayleigh, one of the Vice-Presidents elect, will not be able to
 attend the meeting. The Council recommend that Sir Robert Ball, Royal
 Astronomer of Ireland, be elected Vice-President.

      The Council received a letter from the Board of Trade requesting
 them to appoint one or two members of a committee about to be formed
 for considering the standards for the measurement of the ohm, the
 ampere, and the volt. The Council appointed Professor G. Carey Foster
 and Mr. R. T. Glazebrook members of this committee.

     The Council have elected the following Foreign Men of Science, who
attended the last Meeting of the Association, Corresponding Members :

Prof. Brentano, Munich.                   Dr. Otto Pettersson, Stockholm.
Prof. V. Dwelshauvers-Dery, Liege.        Mr. A. Lawrence Eotch, Eeadville,
Prof. Mascart, Paris.
Prof. W. Ostwald, Leipzig.                    Mass., U.S.A.
Signor Maffeo Pantaleoni, Bari.           Prof. J. H, van't HofE, Amsterdam.

    An invitation to hold the Annual Meeting of the Association at Not-
tingham in the year 1893 has been received, and will be presented to
the General Committee on Monday,
Ixxii   --KKPORT 1891.

     Kesolutions referred to the Council for consideration and action if

desirable :

    (A) ' That the Council consider and report whether grants should be made from
the funds of the Association for other than specific researches by specified

individuals.'

     The Council consider that grants should not be made to any single
institution, or in support of a single object, for many years in succession.
It must be distinctly understood that the aid given by the Association to
any particular scientific institution or investigator must necessarily be
limited and intermittent.

     The Council are of opinion that grants in aid of research should not
be made, except for specified subjects, and under snch circumstances that
satisfactory assurances can be given to the General Committee as to the

person or persons by whom the research is to be carried out.

     (B) ' That it is desirable that the question of publishing the papers more fully
and expeditiously, and of adding reports of discussions, be considered by the

Council.'

     The Council are informed that steps have been taken to insure a more
expeditious publication of the Annual Report.

     They do not recommend that papers should be published more fully
nor do they recommend that discussions should be published, excepting
in special cases when this is strongly advocated by Sectional Committees,
and approved of by the General Committee. They recommend that, in
every such case, an arrangement be made by the General Officers for the

l^roper editing of the discussion.

     (C) ' That in the arrangement of the Journal it is desirable, in the interests of
clearness and of ease of reference, to return to the old practice of printing first the
papers to be read in the various Sections, then the papers read on the previous day
in those Sections, and lastly the list of Sectional Officers and of the Committees.'

     The Council recommend that the papers to be read in the various
Sections be printed first, then the lists of the Committees, and lastly the
papers read on the previous day, and that each page should have a suit-

able heading.

     (D) ' That the Council be requested, if possible, to fix the date of each meeting
two years before it is held, and to bear in mind that the middle or latter part of
September is the time most convenient to many members of the Association.

The Council considered that it is not practicable to fix the date of the

Annual Meeting two years before it is held. They recommend that infor-

mation  be obtained at as early a  date as possible  as  to  the times which
                      _

are convenient to the town where a meeting is to be held, and that the

authorities in such town be informed that the last fortnight in September

is most generally convenient to academical and other important Sections

of the members of the Association.

     (E) ' That the hours at which the Sections and Committees meet be again con-
sidered by the Council.'

     The Council have requested the Organising Committees to propose to
the Council times for the meetings of their respective Committees and
Sections, and recommend that these proposals be adopted for the Cardiff
Meeting as an experimental measure.
BEPOET OF THE COUNCIL.                                      Ixxiii

     (F) ' That a general Index to the Reports of the Committees of tlie Association,
and of all papers ordered to be printed in extenso, be published, and that the Council
be authorised to spend such sums as may be necessary for the purpose.'

     The Council resolved that the Index to the Annual Reports of the
Association be continued from the year 1863 to 1890 inclusive, and that
it consist of one part only. References to Abstracts of Papers will be

printed in italics.

     (Gr) ' That the Council urge upon the Government to take steps to hasten the
completion of the Ordnanfce Survey, and to afEord greater facilities for the purchase
of the Survey Maps.'

     The Council having ascertained that the maps of the Ordnance Survey
are neither known to nor used by the public nearly to the extent they
should be, considering their value and the vast sums of money which
have been expended on their production, and that this neglect arises from
various causes, chief among which are the very defective arrangements
made for the sale of the maps to the public, the obsolete topography of a
large poi-tion of the Survey, and the want of legal authority for the
boundaries shown by the maps, resolved to make to the Government the
following suggestions, with a view to the removal of the present obstacles
to the usefulness of the maps :

     (1) That some modification be made in the present character of
arrangements for the sale of the maps of the Ordnance Survey, wherehy
the maps may become more accessible to the public.

     (2) That such additions be made to the Parliamentary grant for the
Ordnance Survey as will enable the revision to be made more complete,
and the arrears to be brought up to date within a reasonable time.

     (3) That the boundaries and areas of the Ordnance Survey maps be
made legal boundaries and areas in England and Scotland, as they
already are in Ireland, so that they may form a basis for all valuation for

local or imperial assessments.

    This memorandum was communicated to the President of the Board

of Agriculture, together with the following letter from the President of
the Association :

BRITISH ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE.

                                                  22 Albemarle Street, London, W.,

                                                                                 March 11, 1891.

--Sir, I have the honour to invite your consideration of the accompanying memo-

randum, conveying the conclusions of the Council of the Britisli Association for the

Advancement of Science, on the subject of representations made to them in the form

of a resolution passed at the last Annual Meeting of the British Association, held at

Leeds in 1890, relating to some points of importance connected with the Ordnance

Survey and its value to Her Majesty's dominions generally.

I have to express the hope that you will feel disposed to invite the favourable

consideration of Her Majesty's Government to the recommendations included iu the
memorandum in question, and to state that, should you desire any further informa-

tion upon the subjects to which these recommendations relate, the Council of the

British Association will be happy to arrange for a deputation to wait upon you for

the purpose of affording you such additional information.

I have the honour to be, Sir, your obedient Servant,

                                                  (Signed)  F. A. Abel, President.

The Right Hon. Henry Chaplin, M.P.,

          President of the Board of Agriculture.
Ixxiv                      --REPOET 1891.

The following reply from the Board of Agriculture has been

received ;

                                          Board of Agriculture, March 14, 1891.

    Sir,--I am directed by Mr. Chaplin to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of
the 11th inst., forwarding a memorandum on the Ordnance Survey, and to say that

the subject will have due consideration.

                                           I am, yours faithfully.

To Sir F. Abel, C.B., F.R.S., &c., &c.     (Signed) P. H. Bagenal.

     (H) ' That the Council be requested to consider the question of watching the
operation of Acts relating to Scientific and Technical Education, and to take such

steps as may seem desirable for furthering the objects of those Acts.'

     The Council considered this Resolution, and are of opinion that there
is no necessity at the present time for them to take any action,

     (I) ' That the Council be requested to consider whether it is not desirable to
make special provision for the comprehensive consideration by the Association of
questions relating to Scientific and Technical Education.'

     "With regard to this Resolution, the Council understand that the chief
object of the Sectional Committee which originated it was to have
general discussions on scientific and technical questions organised, in

which members of the various Sections who have a special knowledge of

these questions should take part.

     The Council consider that the Sectional Committees have sufficient
powers to deal with this proposal severally and jointly.

     (J) ' That the paper by Mr. J. F. Green on " Steam Life-boats " be printed in
extenso, with the necessary drawings.'

     The Council decided that an abstract only of this paper should be

printed.

                                   PRESIDENT.

It is now many years since this Association has done honour to the
science of Astronomy in the selection of its President.

Since Sir George Airy occupied the chair in 1851, and the late Lord

Wrottesley nine years later in 1860, other sciences have been represented

by the distinguished men who have presided over your meetings.

     The very remarkable discoveries in our knowledge of the heavens

--which have taken place during this period of thirty years one of amazing
--and ever-increasing activity in all branches of science have not passed

unnoticed in the addresses of your successive Presidents                                                                                                                                                                                                               still it seems to
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

me fitting that I should speak to you to-night chiefly of those newer

methods of astronomical research which have led to those discoveries,'and

which have become possible by the introduction since 1860 into j^the
observatory of the spectroscope and the modern photographic plate.

     In 1866 I had the honour of bringing before this Association, at one

of the evening lectures, an account of the first-fruits of the novel and

unexpected advances in our knowledge of the celestial bodies which fol-
lowed rapidly upon Kirchhofi"s original work on the solar spectrum and

the interpretation of its lines.

     Since that time a great harvest has been gathered in the same field
by many reapers. Spectroscopic astronomy has become a distinct and
acknowledged branch of the science, possessing a large literatiire of its
own and observatories specially devoted to it. The more recent discovery

of the gelatine dry plate has given a further great impetus to this modem
side of astronomy, and has opened a pathway into the unknown of which

even an enthusiast thirty years ago would scarcely have dared to dream.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       B2
--4 EEPOET 1891.

     In no science, perhaps, does the sober statement of the results which
have been achieved appeal so strongly to the imagination, and make so

evident the almost boundless powers of the mind of man. By means of

its light alone to analyse the chemical nature of a far distant body ; to be

able to reason about its present state in relation to the past and future

to measure within an English mile or less per second the otherwise in-

visible  motion which  it  may  have  towards  or  from  us                   to  do  more, to
                                                                       ;

make even that which is darkness to our eyes light, and from vibrations

which our organs of sight are powerless to perceive to evolve a revelation

in which we see mirrored some of the stages through which the stars

--may pass in their slow evolutional progress surely the record of such

achievements, however poor the form of words in which they may be

described, is worthy to be regarded as the scientific epic of the present

centni'y.

     I do not purpose to attempt a survey of the progress of spectroscopic

astronomy from its birth at Heidelberg in 1859, but to point out what we
do know at present, as distinguished from wiiat we do not know, of a few
only of its more important problems, giving a prominent place, in
accordance with the traditions of this chair, to the work of the last

year or two.

     In the spectroscope itself advances have been made by Lord Rayleigh

land in the constrnction of concave gratings.

Lord Rayleigh has shown that there is not the necessary connection,

sometimes supposed, between dispersion and resolving power, as besides

the prism or grating other details of construction and of adjustment of a

spectroscope must be taken into account.

The resolving power of the prismatic spectroscope is proportional to

the length of path in the dispersive medium. For the heavy flint glass used

in Lord Rayleigh's experiments the thickness necessary to resolve the
sodium lines came out 102 cm. If this be taken as a unit, the resolving

power of a prism of similar glass will be in the neighbourhood of the sodium
lines equal to the number of centimetres of its thickness. In other parts

of the spectrum the resolving power Avill vary inversely as the third

power of the wave-length, so that it will be eight times as great in the
violet as in the red. The resolving power of a spectroscope is therefore

proportional to the total thickness of the dispersive material in use,

irrespective of the number, the angles, or the setting of the separate

prisms into which, for the sake of convenience, it may be distributed.

The resolving power of a grating depends upon the total number of

lines on its surface, and the order of  spectrum   in  use                    about 1,000 lines
                                                                           ;

being necessary to resolve the sodium lines in the first spectrum.

efficiency of the spectroscope with which chey were made, Professor

Schuster has proposed the use of a unit of purity as well as of resolving

power, for the full resolving power of a spectroscope is realised in practice
only when a sufficiently narrow slit is used. The unit of purity also is

to stand for the separation of two lines differing by one-thousandth of their

own wave-length ; about the separation of the sodium pair at D.

   A farther limitation may come in from the physiological fact that, as

Lord Rayleigh has pointed out, the eye when its full aperture is used is
not a perfect instrument. If we wish to realise the full resolving power
of a spectroscope, therefore, the emergent beam must not be larger than

about one-third of the opening of the pupil.

    Up to the present time the standard of reference for nearly all spec-
troscopic work continues to be Angstrom's map of the solar spectrum,

and his scale based upon his original determinations of absolute wave-
length. It is well known, as was pointed out by Thalen in his work on

the spectrum of iron in 1884, that Angstrom's figures are slightly too
small, in consequence of an error existing in a standard metre used by
him. The corrections for this have been introduced into the tables of
the wave-lengths of terrestrial spectra collected and revised by a Com-
mittee of this Association from 1885 to 1887. Last year the Committee

added a table of corrections to Rowland's scale.
     The inconvenience caused by a change of standard scale is, for a time

at  least, considerable                                                                                   but  there  is  little  doubt  that in the near future
                                                                                                       ;

Rowland's photographic map of the solar spectrum, and his scale based

on the determinations of absolute wave-length by Piei'ce and Bell, or

the Potsdam scale based on original determinations by Miiller and

Kempf, which differs very slightly from it, will come to be exclusively

adopted.

    The gi-eat accuracy of Rowland's photographic map is due chiefly to
the introduction by him of concave gratings, and of a method for their

use, by which the problem of the determination of relative wave-lengths

is simplified to measures of near coincidences of the lines in different

spectra by a micrometer.

     The concave grating and its peculiar mounting, in which no lenses or
telescope are needed, and in which all the spectra are in focus togethw,
formed a new departure of great importance in the measurement of

spectral lines. The valuable method of photographic sensitizers for
different parts of the spectrum has enabled Professor Rowland to include
in his map the whole visible solar spectrum, as well as the ultra-violet
portion as far as it can get through our atmosphere. Some recent photo-

graphs of the solar spectrum, which include A, by Mr. George Higgs,

are of great technical beauty.

     During the past year the results of three independent researches have

appeared, in which the special object of the observers has been to distin-

guish the lines which are due to our atmosphere from those which are

just before their final completion, have assumed the character of a memo-
rial of him ; maps by Dr. Becker ; and sets of photographs of a high and

a low sun by Mr. McClean.
     At the meeting of this Association in Bath, M. Janssen gave an

account of his own researches on the terrestrial lines of the solar spec-

trum, which owe their origin to the oxygen of our atmosphere. He

discovered the remarkable fact that while the intensity of one class of
bands varies as the density of the gas, other diffuse bands vary as the
square of the density. These observations are in accordance with the

work of Bgoroff and of Olszewski, and of Liveing and Dewar on condensed
oxygen. In some recent experiments Olszewski, with a layer of liquid
oxygen thirty millimetres thick, saw, as well as four other bands, the

Aband coincident with Fraunhofer's ; a remarkable instance of the

persistence of absorption through a great range of temperature. The
light which passed through the liquid oxygen had a light blue colour

resembling that of the sky.

     Of not less interest are the experiments of Knut Angstrom, which
show that the carbonic acid and aqueous vapour of the atmosphere reveal
their presence by dark bands in the invisible infra-red region, at the

positions of bands of emission of these substances.

     It is now some thirty years since the spectroscope gave us for the
first time certain knowledge of the nature of the heavenly bodies, and

 revealed the fundamental fact that terrestrial matter is not peculiar to

the solar system, but is common to all the stars which are visible

 to us.

      In the case of a star such as Capella, which has a spectrum almost
 identical with that of the sun, we feel justified in concluding that the
 matter of which it is built up is similar, and that its temperature is also
 high, and not very different from the solar temperature. The task of
 analysing the stars and nebula becomes, however, one of very great diffi-
 culty when we have to do with spectra differing from the solar type.

We are thrown back upon the laboratory for the information necessary

 to enable us to interpret the indications of the spectroscope as to the
 chemical nature, the density and pressure, and the temperature of the

 celestial masses.

     What the spectroscope immediately reveals to us are the waves which

 were set up in the ether filling all interstellar space, years or hundreds
 of years ago, by the motions of the molecules of the celestial substances.
 As a rule it is only when a body is gaseous and sufficiently hot that the
 motions within its molecules can produce bright lines and a corresponding
 absorption. The spectra of the heavenly bodies are indeed to a great
 extent absorption spectra, but we have usually to study them through
 the corresponding emission spectra of bodies brought into the gaseous
 form and rendered luminous by means of flames or of electric dis-
                                                       ADDRESS.

charges. In both cases, unfortunately, as has been shown recently by
Professors Liveing and Dewar, Wiillner, E. Wiedemann, and others,
there appears to be no certain direct relation between the luminous
radiation as shown in the spectroscope and the temperature of the
flame, or of the gaseous contents of the vacuum tube, that is, in the
usual sense of the term as applied to the mean motion of all the
molecules. In both cases, the vibratory motions within the molecules
to which their luminosity is due are almost always much greater than
would be produced by encounters of molecules having motions of transla-
tion no greater than the average motions which characterise the tempera,
ture of the gases as a whole. The temperature of a vacuum tube through
which an electric discharge is taking place may be low, as shown thermo-
metrically, quite apart from the consideration of the extreme smallness
of the mass of gas, but the vibrations of the luminous molecules must be
violent in whatever way we suppose them to be set up by the discharge
if we take Schuster's view that comparatively few molecules are carrying
the discharge, and that it is to the fierce encounters of these alone that
the luminosity is due, then if all the molecules had similar motions, the
temperature of the gas would be very high.

     So in flames where chemical changes are in progress, the vibratory

motions of the molecules which are luminous may be, in connection with

the energy set free in these changes, very different from those correspond-
ing to the mean temperature of the flame.

     Under the ordinary conditions of terrestrial experiments, therefore,
the temperature or the mean vis viva of the molecules may have no direct
relation to the total radiation, which, on the other hand, is the aum of the
radiation due to each luminous molecule.

     These phenomena have recently been discussed by Ebert from the

standpoint of the electro-magnetic theory of light.

    Very great caution is therefore called for when we attempt to reason

by the aid of laboratory experiments to the temperature of the heavenly
bodies from their radiation, especially on the reasonable assumption that
in them the luminosity is not ordinarily associated with chemical changes
or with electrical discharges, but is due to a simple glowing from the
ultimate conversion into molecular motion of the gravitational energy of
shrinkage.

     In a recent paper Stas maintains that electric spectra are to be re-
garded as distinct from flame spectra, and, from researches of his own,

Dthat the pairs of lines of the sodium spectrum other than are produced

only by disruptive electric discharges. As these pairs of lines are found

reversed in the solar spectrum, he concludes that the sun's radiation is
due mainly to electric discharges. But "Wolf and Diacon, and later, "Watts,
observed the other pairs of lines of the sodium spectrum when the vapour
was raised above the ordinary temperature of the Bunsen flame. Recently,

DLiveing and Dewar saw easily, besides the citron and green pairs and

sometimes the blue pair and the orange pair, when hydrogen charged
with sodium vapour was burning at different pressures in oxygen. In
the case of sodium vapour, therefore, and presumably in all other vapours

and gases, it is a matter of indifference whether the necessary vibratory
motion of the molecules is produced by electric discharges or by flames.
The presence of lines in the solar spectrum which we can only produce
electrically is an indication, however, as Stas points out, of the high

temperature of the sun.

   We must not forget that the light from the heavenly bodies may

consist of the combined radiations of different layers of gas at different

temperatures, and possibly be further complicated to an unknown extent

by the absorption of cooler portions of gas outside.
     Not less caution is needed if we endeavour to argue from the

broadening of lines and the coming in of a continuous spectrum as

to the relative pressure of the gas in the celestial atmospheres. On

the one hand, it cannot be gainsaid that in the laboratory the widening

of the lines in a Pliicker's tube follows upon increasing the density of the
residue of hydrogen in the tube, when the vibrations are more frequently
disturbed by fresh encounters ; and that a broadening of the sodium lines
in a flame at ordinary pressure is produced by an increase of the quantity
of sodium in the flame ; but it is doubtful if pressure, as distinguished

from quantity, does produce an increase of the breadth of the lines. An

individual molecule of sodium will be sensibly in the same condition,
considering the relatively enormous number of the molecules of the other
gases, whether the flame is scantily or copiously fed with the sodium salt.
With a small quantity of sodium vapour the intensity will be feeble

except near the maximum of the lines ; when, however, the quantity is
increased the comparative transparency on the sides of the maximum

will allow the light from the additional molecules met with in the path
of the visual ray to strengthen the radiation of the molecules farther
back, and so increase the breadth of the lines.

     In a gaseous mixture it is found, as a rule, that at the same pressure
or temperature, as the encounters with similar molecules become fewer,
the spectral lines will be affected as if the body were observed under
conditions of reduced quantity or temperature.

      In their recent investigation of the spectroscopic behaviour of flames
 under various pressures up to forty atmospheres, Professors Liveing and

Dewar have come to the conclusion that though the prominent feature of
 the Kght emitted by flames at high pressure appears to be a strong con-

 tinuous spectrum, there is not the slightest indication that this continu-
 ous spectrum is produced by the broadening of the lines of the same

gases at low pressure. On the contrary, photometric observations of the

 brightness of the continuous spectrum, as the pressure is varied, show
that it is mainly produced by the mutual action of the molecules of a gas.
 Experiments on the sodium spectrum were carried up to a pressure of
ADDEESS.  9

forty atmosplieres without prodacing any definite effect on the width of
the lines which could be ascribed to the pressure. In a similar way the
lines of the spectrum of water showed no signs of expansion up to twelve
atmospheres ; though more intense than at ordinary pressure, they
remained narrow and clearly defined.

     It follows, therefore, that a continuous spectrum cannot be considered,
when taken alone, as a sure indication of matter in the liquid or the solid
state. Not only, as in the experiments already mentioned, such a.

spectrum may be due to gas when under pressure, but, as Maxwell

pointed out, if the thickness of a medium, such as sodium vapour, which
radiates and absorbs different kinds of light, be very great, and the
temperature high, the light emitted will be of exactly the same composi-
tion as that emitted by lamp-black at the same temperature, for the-
radiations which are feebly emitted will be also feebly absorbed, and can
reach the surface from immense depths. Schuster has shown that
oxygen, even in a partially exhausted tube, can give a continuous spec-
trum when excited by a feeble electric discharge.

     Compound bodies are usually distinguished by a banded spectrum
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;.

but on the other hand such a spectrum does not necessarily show the
presence of compounds, that is, of molecules containing different kinds
of atoms, but simply of a more complex molecule, which may be mad&
up of similar atoms, and be therefore an allotropic condition of the same
body. In some cases, for example, in the diffuse bands of the absorption
spectrum of oxygen, the bands may have an intensity proportional to the
square of the density of the gas, and may be due either to the formation,
of more complex molecules of the gas with inci'ease of pressure, or it may
be to the constraint to which the molecules are subject daring their
encounters with one another.

    It may be thought that at least in the coincidences of bright lines we

are on the solid ground of certainty, since the length of the waves set up.
in the ether by a molecule, say of hydrogen, is the most fixed and abso-
lutely permanent quantity in nature, and is so of physical necessity, for
with any alteration the molecule would cease to be hydrogen.

     Such would be the case if the coincidence were certain ; but an
absolute coincidence can be only a matter of greater or less probability,,
depending on the resolving power employed, on the number of the lines

which correspond and on their characters. When the coincidences are

very numerous, as in the case of iron and the solar spectrum, or the lines-
are characteristically grouped, as in the case of hydrogen and the solar
spectrum, we may regard the coincidence as certain ; but the progress of
science has been greatly retarded by resting important conclusions upon
the apparent coincidence of single lines, in spectroscopes of very small
resolving power. In such cases, unless other reasons supporting the
coincidence are present, the probability of a real coincidence is almost
too small to be of any importance, especially in the case of a heavenly-
10 REPORT 1891.

body which may have a motion of approach or of recession of unknown

amount.
     But even here we are met by the confusion introduced by multiple

spectra, corresponding to different molecular groupings of the same
substance ; and, further, to the influence of substances in vapour upon
each other ; for when several gases are present together, the phenomena
of radiation and reversal by absorption are by no means the same as if

the gases were free from each other's influence, and especially is this the

<;ase when they are illuminated by an electric discharge.

to show that it is only by the laborious and slow process of most

cautious observation that the foundations of the science of celestial

Wephysics can be surely laid.  are at present in a time of transition

when the earlier, and, in the nature of things, less precise observations

are giving place to work of an order of accuracy much greater than was

formerly considered attainable with objects of such small brightness as

the stars.

     The accuracy of the earlier determinations of the spectra of the
terrestrial elements is in most cases insufficient for modern work on the
stars as well as on the sun. They fall much below the scale adopted in
Rowland's map of the sun, as well as below the degree of accuracy attained

at Potsdam by photograpliy in a part of the spectrum for the brighter stars.

Increase of resolving power very frequently breaks up into groups, in the

spectra of the sun and stars, the lines which had been regarded as single,

and their supposed coincidences with terrestrial lines fall to the ground.
For this reason many of the early conclusions, based on observations as
good as it was possible to make at the time with the less powerful spec-
troscopes then in use, may not be found to be maintained under the
much greater resolving power of modern instruments.

     The spectroscope has failed as yet to interpret for us the remarkable
spectrum of the Aurora Borealis. Undoubtedly in this phenomenon

portions of our atmosphere are lighted up by electric discharges ; we
should expect, therefore, to recognise the spectra of the gases known to
be present in it. As yet we have not been able to obtain similar spectra
from these gases artificially, and especially we do not know the origin of
the principal line in the green, which often appears alone, and may have

therefore an origin independent of that of the other lines. Recently the
suggestion has been made that the Aurora is a phenomenon produced by
the dust of meteors and falling stars, and that near positions of certain
auroral lines to lines or flutings of manganese, lead, barium, thallium, iron,
.&c., are sufficient to justify us in regarding meteoric dust in the atmosphere
as the origin of the auroral spectrum. Liveing and Dewar have made a
·conclusive research on this point, by availing themselves of the dust of
excessive minuteness thrown off' from the surface of electrodes of various
ADDRESS.                                                           11

metals and meteorites by a disruptive discharge, and carried forward into
the tube of observation by a more or less rapid current of air or other gas.
These experiments prove that metallic dast, however fine, suspended in a
gas will not act like gaseous matter in becoming luminous with its cha-
racteristic spectrum in an electric discharge, similar to that of the Aurora.

Professor Schuster has suggested that the principal Hue may be due to

some very light gas which is present in too small a pi-oportion to be
detected by chemical analysis or even by the spectroscope in the presence
of the other gases near the earth, but which at the height of the auroral
discharges is in a sufficiently greater relative proportion to give a spectrum.

Lemstrom, indeed, states that he saw this line in the silent discharge of
·a Holtz machine on a mountain in Lapland. The lines may not have
been obtained in our laboratories from the atmospheric gases, on account
of the difficulty of reproducing in tubes with sufficient nearness the

conditions under which the auroral discharges take place.
     In the spectra of comets the spectroscope has shown the presence of

·carbon presumably in combination with hydrogen, and also sometimes
with nitrogen ; and in the case of comets approaching very near the sun,
the lines of sodium, and other lines which have been supposed to belong
+0 iron. Though the researches of Professor H. A. Newton and of
Professor Schiaparelli leave no doubt of the close connection of comets

-with corresponding periodic meteor swarms, and therefore of the probable
identity of cometary matter with that of meteorites, with which the

spectroscopic evidence agrees, it would be perhaps unwise at present to
attempt to define too precisely the exact condition of the matter which

forms the nucleus of the comet. In any case the part of the light of

the comet which is not reflected solar light can scarcely be attributed

to a high temperature produced by the clashing of separate meteoric

Westones set up within the nucleus by the sun's disturbing force.  must

look rather to disruptive electric discharges produced probably by pro-

cesses of evaporation due to increased solar heat, which would be amply

sufficient to set free portions of the occluded gases into the vacuum of

space. May it be that these discharges are assisted, and indeed possibly

increased, by the recently discovered action of the ultra-violet part of the

«un's light ? Hertz has shown that ultra-violet light can produce a dis-

charge from a negatively electrified piece of metal, while Hallwachs and

Righi have shown further that ultra-violet light can even charge posi-

tively an unelectrified piece of metal phenomena which Lenard and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

Wolf associate with the disengagement from the metallic surfaces of very

minute particles. Similar actions on cometary matter, unscreened as it is

by an absorptive atmosphere, at least of any noticeable extent, may well

be powerful when a comet approaches the sun, and help to explain an

electrified condition of the evaporated matter which would possibly bring

point in speaking of the solar corona.
--12 REPORT 1891.

   A very great advance lias been made in our knowledge of the consti-

tution of the sun by the recent work at the Johns Hoi^kins University
by means of photography and concave gratings, in comparing the solar
spectrum, under great resolving power, directly with the spectra of
the terrestrial elements. Professor Rowland has shown that the lines
of thirty-six terrestrial elements at least are certainly present in the solai-
spectrum, while eight others are doubtful. Fifteen elements, including
nitrogen as it shows itself under an electric discharge in a vacuum tube,
have not been found in the solar spectrum. Some ten other elements,
inclusive of oxygen, have not yet been compared with the sun's spectrum.

     Rowland remai'ks that of the fifteen elements named as not found in
the sun, many are so classed because they have few strong lines, or none
at all, in the limit of the solar spectrum as compared by him with the arc.
Boron has only two strong lines. The lines of bismuth are compound
and too diffuse. Therefore even in the case of these fifteen elements
there is little evidence that they are really absent from the sun.

     It follows that if the whole earth were heated to the temperature of

the sun, its spectrum would resemble very closely the solar spectrum.

    Rowland has not found any lines common to several elements, and in
the case of some accidental coincidences, more accurate investigation
reveals some slight difference of wave-length or a common impurity.

Further, the relative strength of the lines in the solar spectrum is gene-
rally, with a few exceptions, the same as that in the electric arc, so that
Rowland considers that his experiments show ' very little evidence ' of
the breaking up of the terrestrial elements in the sun.

      Stas in a recent paper gives the final results of eleven years of research
on the chemical elements in a state of purity, and on the possibility of
decomposing them by the physical and chemical forces at our disposal.
His experiments on calcium, strontium, lithium, magnesium, silver, sodium
and thallium, show that these substances retain their individuality uiider

all conditions, and are unalterable by any forces that we can bring to bear
upon them.

     Professor Rowland looks to the solar lines which are unaccounted
for as a means of enabling him to discover such new terrestrial ele-
ments as still lurk in rare minerals and earths, by confronting their
spectra directly with that of the sun. He has already resolved yttrium
spectroscopically into three components, and actually into two. The
comparison of the results of this independent analytical method with the
remarkable but different conclusions to which M. Lecoq de Boisbaudran
and Mr: Crookes have been led respectively, from spectroscopic observa-
tion of these bodies when glowing under molecular bombardment in a
Tacuum tube, will be awaited with much interest. It is worthy of remark
that as our knowledge of the spectrum of hydrogen in its complete form
came to us from the stars, it is now from the sun that chemistry is pro-
 bably i\\)< wt to be enriched by the discovery of new element?.
ADDRESS.  13

     In a discussion in the Bakerian lecture for 1885 of what we knew up
to that time of the sun's corona, I was led to the conclusion that the
corona is essentially a phenomenon similar in the cause of its formation
to the tails of comets, namely, that it consists for the most part probably
of matter going from the sun under the action of a force, possibly electrical,
which varies as the surface, and can therefore in the case of highly

attenuated matter easily master the force of gravity even near the snn.

Though many of the coronal particles may return to the sun, those which

form the long rays or streamers do not return ; they separate and soon

become too diffused to be any longer visible, and may well go to furnish

the matter of the zodiacal light, which otherwise has not received a satis-

factoiy explanation. And further, if such a force exist at the sun, the
changes of terrestrial magnetism may be due to direct electric action,

as the earth moves through lines of inductive force.

     These conclusions appear to be in accordance broadly with the lines
along which thought has been directed by the results of subsequent
eclipses. Professor Schuster takes an essentially similar view, and

suggests that there may be a direct electric connection between the sun
and the planets. He asks further whether the sun may not act like a
magnet in consequence of its revolution about its axis. Professor Bigelow

has recently treated the coronal forms by the theory of spherical har-
monics, on the supposition that we see phenomena similar to those of free
electricity, the rays being lines of force, and the coronal matter discharged
from the sun, or at least arranged or controlled by these forces. At the

extremities of the streams for some reasons the repulsive power may be
lost, and gravitation set in, bringing the matter back to the sun. The

matter which does leave the sun is persistently transported to the equa-

torial plane of the corona ; in fact, the zodiacal light may be the accumu-

lation at great distances from the sun along this equator of such like
material. Photographs on a larger scale will be desirable for the full

development of the conclusions which may follow from this study of the

curved forms of the coronal structure. Professor Schaeberle, however,

considers that the coronal phenomena may be satisfactorily accounted for

on the supposition that the coi'ona is formed of streams of matter ejected
mainly from the spot zones with great initial velocities, but smaller than
382 miles a second. Further that the different types of the corona are
due to the effects of perspective on the streams from the earth's place at
the time relatively to the plane of the solar equator.

     Of the physical and the chemical nature of the coronal matter we know

very little. Schuster concludes, from an examination of the eclipses of
1882, 1883, and 1886, that the continuous spectrum of the corona has the

maximum of actinic intensity displaced considerably towards the red when

compared with the spectrum of the sun, which shows that it can only be
due in small part to solar light scattered by small particles. The lines of
calcium and of hydrogen do not appear to form part of the normal spectrum
14 KEPORT 1891.

of the corona. The green coronal line has no known representative in
terrestrial substances, nor has Schuster been able to recognise any of our

elements in the other lines of the corona.

     The spectra of the stars are almost inBnitely diversified, yet they can
be arranged with some exceptions in a series in which the adjacent

spectra, especially in the photographic region, are scarcely distinguish-
able, passing from the bluish-white stars hke Sirius, through stars more
or less solar in character, to stars with banded spectra, which divide-
themselves into two apparently independent groups, according as the-
stronger edge of the bands is towards the red or the blue. In such an
arrangement the sun's place is towards the middle of the series.

     At present a difference of opinion exists as to the direction in the series
in which evolution is proceeding, whether by further condensation white
stars pass into the orange and red stages, or whether these more coloured
stars are younger and will become white by increasing age. The latter
view was suggested by Johnstone Stoney in 1867.

    About ten years ago Ritter, in a series of papers, discussed the behaviour
of gaseous masses during condensation, and the probable resulting con-
stitution of the heavenly bodies. According to him, a star passes through
the orange and red stages twice, first during a comparatively short
period of increasing temperature which culminates in the white stage, and
a second time during a more prolonged stage of gradual cooling. He-
suggested that the two groups of banded stars may correspond to these-
different periods : the young stars being those in which the stronger
edge of the dark band is towards the blue, the other banded stars, which
are relatively less luminous and few in number, being those which ar&
approaching extinction through age.

      Recently a similar evolutional order has been suggested, which is based
upon the hypothesis that the nebulae and stars consist of colliding meteoric

stones in different stages of condensation.

     More recently the view has been put forward that the diversified
spectra of the stars do not represent the stages of an evolutional progress,
but are due for the most part to differences of original constitution.

     The few minutes which can be given to this part of the address are

insufficient for a discussion of these different views. I purpose, therefore,

to state briefly, and with reserve as the subject is obscure, some of the

considerations from the characters of their spectra which appeared to me to

be in favour of the evolutional order in which I arranged the stars from
their photographic spectra in 1879. This order is essentially the same
as Vogel had previously proposed in his classification of the stars in
1874, in which the white stars, which are most numerous, represent the
early adult and most persistent stage of stellar life, the solar condition
that of full maturity and of commencing age ; while in the orange and red
stars with banded spectra we see the setting in and advance of old age.

But this statement must be taken broadly, and not as asserting tbat all
stars, however dififerent in mass and possibly to some small extent in
original constitution, exhibit one invariable succession of spectra.

     In the spectra of the white stars the dark metallic Hues are relatively
inconspicuous, and occasionally absent, at the same time that the dark
lines of hydrogen are usually strong, and more or less broad, upon a con-
tinuous spectrum, which is remarkable for its brilliancy at the blue end.
In some of these stars the hydrogen and some other lines are bright,,

and sometimes variable.
    As the greater or less prominence of the hydrogen lines, dark or

bright, is characteristic of the white stars as a class, and diminishes-

o-radually with the incoming and increase in strength of the other lines,
we are probably justified in regarding it as due to some conditions
which occur naturally during the progress of stellar life, and not to

a peculiarity of original constitution.

To produce a strong absorption-spectrum a substance must be at the

particular temperature at which it is notably absorptive; and, further,,

this temperature must be sufficiently below that of the region behind

from which the light comes for the gas to appear, so far as its special

rays are concerned, as darkness upon it. Considering the high tem-

perature to which hydrogen must be raised before it can show its

characteristic emission and absorption, we shall probably be right in

attributing the relative feebleness or absence of the other lines, not to the

paucity of the metallic vapours, but rather to their being so hot relatively

to the substances behind them as to show feebly, if at all, by reversion.

Such a state of things would more probably be found, it seems to me, in

Aconditions anterior to the solar stage.  considerable cooling of the sun

would probably give rise to banded spectra due to compounds, or to more

complex molecules, which might form near the condensing points of the

vapours.

     The sun and stars are generally regarded as consisting of glowing
vapours surrounded by a photosphere where condensation is taking place,
the temperature of the photospheric layer from which the greater part of the
radiation comes being constantly renewed from the hotter matter within.

     At the surface the convection currents would be strong, producing
a considerable commotion, by which the different gases would be mixed

and not allowed to retain the inequality of proportions at different levels

due to their vapour densities.

    Now the conditions of the radiating photosphere and those of the

gases above it, on which the character of the spectrum of a star depends,
will be determined, not alone by temperature, but also by the force of
gravity in these regions ; this force will be fixed by the star's mass and
its stage of condensation, and will become greater as the star continues

to condense.

     In the case of the sun the force of gravity has already become so

great at tlie snrrace that the decrease of the density of the gases must be
extremely rapid passing in the space of a few miles, from atmosphei'ic

pressure to a density infinitesimally small ; consequently the temperature-
gradient at the surface, if determined solely by expansion, must be ex-

tremely rapid. The gases here, however, are exposed to the fierce
I'adiation of the sun, and unless wholly transparent would take up heat,
especially if any solid or liquid particles were present from condensation

or convection currents.

     From these causes, within a very small extent of space at the surface
of the sun, all bodies with which we are acquainted should fall to a con-
dition in which the extremely tenuous gas could no longer give a visible
spectrum. The insignificance of the angle subtended by this space as

seen from the earth should cause the boundary of the solar atmosphere to
appear defined. If the boundary which we see be that of the sun pi-oper,

the matter above it will have to be regarded as in an essentially dynamical

--condition an assemblage, so to speak, of gaseous projectiles for the most

part falling back upon the sun after a greater or less range of flight.
But in any case it is within a space of relatively small extent in the sun
and probably in the other solar stars, that the reversion vyhich is mani-
fested by dark lines is to be regarded as taking place.

     Passing backward in the star's life, we should find a gradual weak-

ening of gravity at the surface, a reduction of the temperature-gradient
so far as it was determined by expansion, and convection currents of less
violence producing less interference with the proportional quantities of
gases due to their vapour densities, while the efi"ects of eruptions would
be more extensive.

     At last we might come to a state of things in which, if the star were
hot enough, only hydrogen might be sufficiently cool relatively to the
radiation behind to produce a strong absoi'ption. The lower vapours
 would be protected, and might continue to be relatively too hot for their
lines to appear very dark upon the continuous spectrum ; besides, their
lines might be possibly to some extent eSaced by the coming in under

such conditions in the vapours themselves of a continuous spectrum.
      In such a star the light radiated towards the upper part of the atmo-

sphere may have come from portions lower down of the atmosphere itself,
or at least from parts not greatly hotter. There may be no such great

difierence of temperature of the low and less low portions of the star's
atmosphere as to make the darkening efiect of absorption of the protected
metallic vapours to prevail over the illuminating efiect of their emission.

     It is only by a vibratory motion corresponding to a very high tem-
perature that the bright lines of the first spectrum of hydrogen can be
brought out, and by the equivalence of absorbing and emitting power
that the corresponding spectrum of absorption should be produced yet for

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

or gas. Such conditions, it seems to me, should occur in the earlier rather
than in the more advanced stages of condensation.

    The subject is obscure, and we may go wrong in our mode of conceiv-

ing of the probable progress of events, but there can be no doubt that in

one remarkable instance the white-star spectrum is associated with an

early stage of condensation.

Sirius is one of the most conspicuous examples of one type of this

class of stars. Photometric observations combined with its ascertained

parallax show that this star emits from forty to sixty times the light of

our sun, even to the eye, which is insensible to ultra-violet light, in which
Sirius is very rich, while we learn from the motion of its companion
that its mass is not much more than double that of our sun. It follows
that unless we attribute to this star an impi-obably great emissive power,
it must be of immense size, and in a much more diffuse and therefore

an earlier condition than our sun ; though probably at a later stage

than those white stars in which the hydrogen lines are bright.

   A direct determination of the relative temperature of the photospheres

of the stars might possibly be obtained in some cases from the relative

position of maximum radiation of their continuous spectra. Langley

has shown that through the whole range of temperature on which we can
experiment, and presumably at temperatures beyond, the maximum of

radiation-power in solid bodies gradually shifts upwards in the spectrum

from the infra-red through the red and orange, and that in the sun it has

reached the blue.

The defined character as a rule of the stellar lines of absorption sug-

gests that the vapours producing them do not at the same time exert any

strong power of general absorption. Consequently we should probably
not go far wrong, when the photosphere consists of liquid or solid parti-
cles, if we could compare select parts of the continuous spectrum between

the stronger lines or where they are fewest. It is obvious that if extended

portions of different stellar spectra were compared, their true relation
would be obscured by the line-absorption.

     The increase of temperature, as shown by the rise in the spectrum of

the maximum of radiation, may not always be accompanied by a corre-

sponding greater brightness of a star as estimated by the eye, which is an
extremely imperfect photometric instrument. Not only is the eye blind

to large regions of radiation, but even for the small range of light that
we can see the visual effect varies enormously with its colour. According

to Professor Langley, the same amount of energy which just enables us to

Aperceive light in the crimson at would in the green produce a visual

effect 100,000 times greater. In the violet the proportional effect would

be 1,600, in the blue 62,000, in the yellow,28,000, in the orange 14,000,

and in the red 1,200. Captain Abney's recent experiments make the
·sensitiveness of the eye for the green near P to be 750 times greater than

for red about C. It is for this reason, at least in part, that I suggested
                                                                                                                                                                                                        '

in 1864), and have since shown by direct observation, that the spectrum,

of the nebula in Andromeda, and presumably of similar nebulae, is in

appearance only wanting in the red.

The stage at which the maximum radiation is in the green, corre-

sponding to the eye's greatest sensitiveness, would be that in which it

could be most favourably measured by eye-photometry. As the maxi-

mum rose into the violet and beyond, the star would increase in visual

brightness, but not in proportion to the increase of energy radiated by it.

The brightness of a star would be affected by the nature of the sub-

stance by which the light was chiefly emitted. In the laboratory solid

Acarbon exhibits the highest emissive power.  stellar stage in which

radiation comes, to a large extent, from a photosphere of the solid parti-

cles of this substance, would be favourable for great brilliancy. Though

the stars ai'e built up of matter essentially similar to that of the sun, it

does not follow that the proportion of the different elements is everywhere

the same. It may be that the substances condensed in the photospheres
of different stars may differ in their emissive powers, but probably not to

a great extent.

All the heavenly bodies are seen by us through the tinted medium of

our atmosphere. According to Langley, the solar stage of stars is not

really yellow, but, even as gauged by our imperfect eyes, would appear

bluish-white if we could free ourselves from the deceptive influences of

our surroundings.

From these considerations it follows that we can scai'cely infer the

evolutional stages of the stars from a simple comparison of their eye-

Wenaagnitudes.     should expect the white stars to be, as a class, less

dense than the stars in the solar stage. As great mass might bring in

the solar type of spectrum at a relatively earlier time, some of the brightest

--of these stars may be very massive and brighter than the sun for example,,

the brilliant star Arcturus. For these reasons the solar stars should not

only be denser than the white stars, but perhaps, as a class, surpass them

in mass and eye-brightness.

It has been shown by Lane that, so long as a condensing gaseous mass

remains subject to the laws of a purely gaseous body, its temperature will
continue to rise.

     The greater or less breadth of the lines of absorption of hydrogen in
the white-stars may be due to variations of the depth of the hydrogen in
the hue of sight, arising from the causes which have been discussed. At

the sides of the lines the absorption and emission are feebler than in the
middle, and would come out more strongly with a greater thickness of gas.

     The diversities among the white stars are nearly as numerous as the
individuals of the class. Time does not permit me to do more than to-
record that in addition to the three sub-classes into which they have been
divided by Vogel, Scheiner has recently investigated minor differences-

Heas suggested by the character of the third line of hydrogen near G.
ADDRESS.  19

 has pointed out too that so far as his observations go the white stars in
 the constellation of Orion stand alone, with the exception of Algol, in
possessing a dark line in the blue which has apparently the same posi-
tion as a bright line in the great nebula of the same constellation ; and
 Pickering finds in his photographs of the spectra of these stars dark lines

corresponding to the principal lines of the bright-line stars, and the plane-
tary nebulae with the exception of the chief nebular line. The association
of white stars with nebular matter in Orion, in the Pleiades, in the region

of the Milky Way, and in other parts of the heavens, may be regarded

as falling in with the view that I have taken.

     In the stars possibly further removed from the white class than our
sun, belonging to the first division of Vogel's third class, which are dis-
tinguished by absorption bands with their stronger edge towards the
blue, the hydrogen lines are narrower than in the solar spectrum. In
these stars the density-gradient is probably still more rapid, the depth of

hydrogen may be less, and possibly the hydrogen molecules may be
affected by a larger number of encounters with dissimilar molecules. In

some red stars with dark hydrocarbon bands the hydrogen lines have not

been certainly observed ; if they are really absent, it may be because the

temperature has fallen below the point at which hydrogen can exert its
characteristic absorption ; besides, some hydrogen will have united with

the carbon. The coming in of the hydrocarbon bands may indicate a later
evolutional stage, but the temperature may still be high, as acetylene

can exist in the electric arc.

    A number of small stars more or leas similar to those which are known

by the names of their discoverers. Wolf and Rayet, have been found
by Pickering in his photographs. These are remarkable for several
brilliant groups of bright lines, including frequently the hydrogen lines
and the line D3, upon a continuoiis spectrum strong in blue and violet
rays, in which are also dark lines of absorption. As some of the bright
groups appear in his photographs to agree in position with corresponding

bright lines in the planetary nebulae, Pickering suggests that these stars
should be placed in one class with them, although the brightest nebular
line is absent from these stars. The simplest conception of their nature
would be that each star is surrounded by a nebula, the bright groups beine
due to the gaseous matter outside the star. Mr. Roberts, however, has
not been able to bring out any indication of nebulosity by prolono-ed

exposure. The remarkable star 17 Argus may belong to this class of

the heavenly bodies.

     In the nebulae, the elder Herschel saw portions of the fiery mist or
' shining fluid ' out of which the heavens and the earth had been slowly
fashioned. For a time this view of the nebulas gave place to that which
regarded them as external galaxies, cosmical " sandheaps,' too remote to
be resolved into separate stars ; though indeed in 1858 Mr. Herbert

                                                                                                                              c2

Spencer showed that the observations of nebulae up to that time were

really in favour of an evolutional progress.

In  1864  I     brought  the spectroscope to bear  upon    them                             the  bright
                                                                                         ;

lines which flashed upon the eye showed the source of the light of a
number of them to be glowing gas, and so restored these bodies to what

is probably their true place, as an early stage of sidereal life.
    At that early time our knowledge of stellar spectra was small. For this

reason partly, and probably also under the undue influence of theological

opinions then widely prevalent, I unwisely wrote in my original paper

in 1864, ' that in these objects we no longer have to do with a special

modification of our own type of sun, but find ourselves in presence of
objects possessing a distinct and peculiar plan of structure.' Two years

later, however, in a lecture before this Association, I took a truer position.

' Our views of the universe,'  I said,  ' are  undergoing  important changes
                                                                                                                                                                ;

let us wait for more facts with minds unfettered by any dogmatic theory,

and therefore free to receive the teaching, whatever it may be, of new

observations.'

Let us turn aside for a moment from the nebulae in the sky to the

conclusions to which philosophers had been irresistibly led by a considera-

Wetion of the features of the solar system.        have before us in the

sun and planets obviously not a haphazard aggregation of bodies, but

a system resting upon a multitude of relations pointing to a common

physical cause. i?rom these considerations Kant and Laplace formulated

the nebular hypothesis, resting it on gravitation alone, for at that time

the science of the conservation of energy was practically unknown. These

philosophers showed how, on the supposition that the space now occupied

by the solar system was once fiUed by a vaporous mass, the formation

of the sun and planets could be reasonably accounted for.

By a totally difi"erent method of reasoning, modern science traces

the solar system backward step by step to a similar state of things at

the beginning. According to Helmholtz the sun's heat is maintained

by the contraction of his mass, at the rate of about 220 feet a year.

Whether at the present time the sun is getting hotter or colder we do

Wenot certainly know.    can reason back to the time when the sun was

sufliciently expanded to fill the whole space occupied by the solar system,

and was reduced to a great glowing nebula. Though man's life, the life

of the race perhaps, is too short to give us direct evidence of any distinct

stages of so august a process, still the probability is great that the

nebular hypothesis, especially in the more precise form given to it by

Roche, does represent broadly, notwithstanding some difficulties, the

succession of events through which the sun and planets have passed.

The nebular hypothesis of Laplace requires a rotating mass of fluid

which at successive epochs became unstable from excess of motion, and

left behind rings, or more probably perhaps lumps, of matter from the

equatorial regions.
ADDBESS.  21

     The difficulties to whicli I have referred have suggested to some
thinkers a different view of things, according to which it is not necessary
to suppose that one part of the system gravitationally supports another.
The whole may consist of a congeries of discrete bodies even if these
bodies be the ultimate molecules of matter. The planets may have been

formed by the gradual accretion of such discrete bodies. On the view

that the material of the condensing solar system consisted of separate

particles or masses, we have no longer the fluid pressure which is an

essential part of Laplace's theory. Faye, in his theory of evolution from
meteorites, has to throw over this fundamental idea of the nebular
hypothesis, and he formulates instead a different succession of events in
which the outer planets were formed last ; a theory which has difficulties
of its own.

     Professor George Darwin has recently shown, from an investigation
of the mechanical conditions of a swarm of meteorites, that on certain
assumptions a meteoric swarm might behave as a coarse gas, and in this
way bring back the fluid pressure exercised by one part of the system on
the other, which is required by Laplace's theory. One chief assumption
consists in supposing that such inelastic bodies as meteoric stones might
attain the effective elasticity of a high order which is necessary to the
theory through the sudden volatilisation of a part of their mass at an
encounter, by which what is virtually a violent explosive is introduced
between the two colliding stones. Professor Darwin is careful to point
out that it must necessarily be obscure as to how a small mass of solid
matter can take up a very large amount of energy in a small fraction of a

second.

    Any direct indications from the heavens themselves, however slight,

are of so great value, that I should perhaps in this connection call atten-
tion to a recent remarkable photograph by Mr. Roberts of the great

nebula in Andromeda. On this plate we seem to have presented to us

some stage of cosmical evolution on a gigantic scale. The photograph
shows a sort of whirlpool disturbance of the luminous matter which is
distributed in a plane inclined to the line of sight, in which a series of
rings of bright matter separated by dark spaces, greatly foreshortened by
perspective, surround a large undefined central mass. The parallax of this
nebula has not been ascertained, but there can be little doubt that we are
looking upon a system very remote, and therefore of a magnitude great
beyond our power of adequate comprehension. The matter of this nebula,
in whatever state it may be, appears to be distributed, as in so many
other nebulae, in rings or spiral streams, and to suggest a stage in a suc-
cession of evolutional events not inconsistent with that which the nebular
hypothesis requires. To liken this object more directly to any particular
stage in the formation of the solar system would be ' to compare things
great with small,' and might be indeed to introduce a false analogy but

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

on the other hand, we should err through an excess of caution if we did

not accept the remarkable features brought to light by this photograph
as a presumptive indication of a progress of events in cosmical history

following broadly upon the lines of Laplace's theory.
     The old view of the original matter of the nebulae, that it consisted of

a. ' fiery mist,'

                                 ' a tumultuous cloud
                   Instinct with fire and nitre,'

fell at once with the rise of the science of thermodynamics. In 1854

Helmholtz showed that the supposition of an original fiery condition of

the nebulous stuff was unnecessary, since in the mutual gravitation of

widely separated matter we have a store of potential energy sufficient to

Wegenerate the high temperature of the sun and stars.     can scarcely go

wrong in attributing the light of the nebulce to the conversion of the

gravitational energy of shrinkage into molecular motion.

The idea that the light of comets and of nebulse may be due to a suc-

cession of ignited flashes of gas from the encounters of meteoric stones

was suo-o-ested by Professor Tait, and was brought to the notice of this

Association in 1871 by Sir William Thomson in his Presidential Address.

The spectrum of the bright-line nebulje is certainly not such a spec-

trum as we should expect from the flashing by collisions of meteorites
similar to those which have been analysed in our laboratories. The

strongest lines of the substances which in the case of such meteorites
would first show themselves, iron, sodium, magnesium, nickel, &c., are

not those which distinguish the nebular spectrum. On the contrary, this

spectrum is chiefly remarkable for a few brilliant lines, very narrow and

defined, upon a background of a faint continuous spectrum, which con-

tains numerous bright lines, and probably some lines of absorption.

The two most conspicuous lines have not been interpreted; for

though the second line falls near, it is not coincident with a strong double

line of iron. It is hardly necessary to say that though the near position

of the brightest line to the bright double line of nitrogen, as seen in a

small spectroscope in 1864, naturally suggested at that early time the

possibility of the presence of this element in the nebulae, I have been

careful to point out, to prevent misapprehension, that in more recent

years the nitrogen line and subsequently a lead line have been eruployed

by me solely as fiducial points of reference in the spectrum.
     The third line we know to be the second line of the first spectrum of

hydrogen. Mr. Keeler has seen the first hydrogen line in the red, and
photographs show that this hydrogen spectrum is probably present in its
complete form, or nearly so, as we first learnt to know it in the absorp-
tion spectrum of the white stars.

    We are not surprised to find associated with it the line D3, near the

position of the absent sodium lines, probably due to the atom of some
unknown gas, which in the sun can only show itself in the outbursts of
                                ADDRESS.                       23

highest temperature, and for this reason does not reveal itself by absorp-

tion in the solar spectrum.

It is not unreasonable to assume that the two brightest lines, which

are of the same order as the third line, are produced by substances of a

similar nature, in which a vibratory motion corresponding to a very high

temperature is also necessary. These substances, as well as that repre-

sented by the line D3, may be possibly some of the unknown elements

which are wanting in our terrestrial chemistry between hydrogen and

lithium, unless indeed D3 be on the lighter side of hydrogen.

In the laboratory we must have recourse to the electric discharge to

bring out the spectrum of hydrogen but in a vacuum-tube, though the
                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

radiation may be great, from the relative fewness of the luminous atoms

or molecules or from some other cause, the temperature of the gas as

a whole may be low.
    On account of the large extent of the nebulte, a comparatively small

number of luminous molecules or atoms would probably be sufficient to
make the nebute as bright as they appear to us. On such an assumption

the average temperature may be low, but the individual particles, which

by their encounters are luminous, must have motions corresponding to

a very high temperature, and in this sense be extremely hot.

In such diffuse masses, from the great mean length of free path, the

encounters would be rare but correspondingly violent, and tend to bring

about vibrations of comparatively short period, as appears to be the case

if we may judge by the great relative brightness of the more refrangible

lines of the nebular spectrum.

Such a view may perhaps reconcile the high temperature which the

nebular spectrum undoubtedly suggests with the much lower mean tem-

perature of the gaseous mass, which we should expect at so early a stage

of condensation, unless we assume a very enormous mass or that the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

matter coming together had previously considerable motion, or consider-

able molecular agitation.

If the hydrogen shown by the spectroscope in the nebulae and in the

atmospheres of the stars is retained by these bodies, we should be able to

assign approximately an inferior limit for the force of gravity at their

surfaces provided that we assume that the gas is in the uncombined

state, and always exists in some greater proportion than in the free space

about them.

The inquisitiveness of the human mind does not allow us to remain

content with the interpretation of the present state of the cosmical masses,

but suggests the question

                                ' What see'st thou else

             In the dark backward and abysm of time ?

    What was the original state of things ? how has it come about that by
the side of ageing worlds we have nebulse in a relatively younger stage ?
Have any of them received their birth from dark suns, which have col-

lided into new life, and so belong to a second or later generation of the

heavenly bodies ?
     During the short historic period, indeed, there is no record of such an

event ; still it would seem to be only through the collision of dark suns,
of which the number must be increasing, that a temporary rejuvenescence
of the heavens is possible, and by such ebbings and flowings of stellar life
that the inevitable end to which evolution in its apparently uncompen-
sated progress is carrying us can, even for a little, be delayed.

     "We cannot refuse to admit as possible such an origin for nebulae.
     In considering, however, the formation of the existing nebulaa we
must bear in mind that, in the part of the heavens within our ken, the
stars still in the early and middle stages of evolution exceed greatly in
number those which appear to be in an advanced condition of condensa-

tion. Indeed, we find some stars which may be regarded as not far

advanced beyond the nebular condition.

    It may be that the cosmical bodies which are still nebulous owe the

lateness of their development to some conditions of the part of space

where they occur, such as conceivably a greater original homogeneity, in
consequence of which condensation began less early. In other parts of
space condensation may have been still further delayed, or even have not
yet begun. It is worthy of remark that these nebulae group themselves
about the Milky Way, where we find a preponderance of the white- star
type of stars, and almost exclusively the bright-line stars which Pickering
associates with the planetary nebulas. Further, Dr. Grill concludes, from
the rapidity with which they impress themselves ujDon the plate, that the
fainter stars of the Milky "Way also, to a large extent, belong to this early
type of stars. At the same time other types of stars occur also over this
region, and the red hydrocarbon stars are found in certain parts ; but

possibly these stars may be before or behind the Milky Way, and not

physically connected with it.

     If light matter be suggested by the spectrum of these nebulae, it may
be asked further, as a pure speculation, whether in them we are witness-

ing possibly a later condensation of the light matter which had been left
behind, at least in a relatively greater proportion, after the first growth
 of worlds into which the heavier matter condensed, though not without
 some entanglement of the lighter substances. The wide extent and great
 diflfuseness of this bright-line nebulosity over a large part of the con-

 stellation of Orion may be regarded perhaps as pointing in this direction.
The diffuse nebulous matter streaming round the Pleiades may possibly

 be another instance, though the character of its spectrum has not yet
 been ascertained.

       In the planetary nebulae, as a rule, there is a sensible increase of the
 faint continuous spectrum, as well as a shght thickening of the bright
 lines towards the centre of the nebula, appearances which are in favour
of the view that these bodies are condensing gaseous masses.
ADDBESS.  25>

      Professor G. Darwin, in his investigation of the equiHbrium of a rotat-
ing mass of fluid, found, in accordance with the independent researches

of Poincare, that when a portion of the central body becomes detached

through increasing angular velocity, the portion should bear a far larger
ratio to the remainder than is observed in the planets and satellites of the
solar system, even taking into account heterogeneity from the condensa-
tion of the parent mass.

    Now this state of things, in which the masses though not equal are of
the same order, does seem to prevail in many nebute, and to have given

birth to a large class of binary stars. Mr. See has recently investigated
the evolution of bodies of this class, and points out their radical difiierences
from the solar system in the relatively large mass-ratios of the component
bodies, as well as in the high eccentricities of their orbits brought about
by tidal friction, which would play a more important part in the evolution
of such systems.

     Considering the large number of these bodies, he suggests that the solar
system should perhaps no longer be regarded as representing celestial
evolution in its normal form

                        ' A goodly Paterne to whose perfect mould
                           He fashioned them . . .'

but rather as modified by conditions which are exceptional.

    It may well be that in the very early stages condensing masses are
subject to very different conditions, and that condensation may not always
begin at one or two centres, but sometimes set in at a large number of
points, and proceed in the different cases along very different lines of

evolution.

     Besides its more direct use in the chemical analysis of the heavenly
bodies, the spectroscope has given to us a great and unexpected power of
advance along the lines of the older astronomy. In the future a higher
value may, indeed, be placed upon this indirect use of the spectroscope
than upon its chemical revelations.

    By no direct astronomical methods could motions of approach or of
recession of the stars be even detected, much less could they be measured.
A body coming directly towards us or going directly from us appears to
stand still. In the case of the stars we can receive no assistance from

change of size or of brightness. The stars show no true discs in our
instruments, and the nearest of them is so far off that if it were approach-
ing us at the rate of a hundred miles in a second of time, a whole
century of such rapid approach would not do more than increase its
brightness by the one-fortieth part.

     Still it was only too clear that, so long as we were unable to ascertain
directly those components of the stars' motions which lie in the line of
sight, the speed and direction of the solar motion in space, and many of
--·26 REPORT 1891.

the great problems of the constitution of the heavens, must remain more

or less imperfectly known. Now the spectroscope has placed in our

hands this power, which, though so essential, appeared almost in the
nature of things to lie for ever beyond our grasp ; it enables us to measure
directly, and under favourable circumstances to within a mile per second,
or even less, the speed of approach or of recession of a heavenly body.
This method of observation has the great advantage for the astronomer
of being independent of the distance of the moving body, and is
therefore as applicable and as certain in the case of a body on the
extreme confines of the visible universe, so long as it is bright enough,

 as in the case of a neighbouring planet.
      Doppler had suggested as far back as 1841 that the same principle, on

 which he had shown that a sound should become sharper or flatter if
there were an approach or a recession between the ear and the source
 of the sound, would apjjly equally to light; and he went on to say that
the difference of colour of some of the binary stars might be produced in
this way by their motions. Doppler was right in that the principle is
 true in the case of light, but he was wrong in the particular conclusion
 which he drew from it. Even if we suppose a star to be moving with a
 sufficiently enormous velocity to alter sensibly its colour to the eye, no
 such change would actually be seen, for the reason that the store of
 invisible light beyond both limits of the visible spectrum, the blue and
 the red, would be drawn upon, and light- waves invisible to us would be
 exalted or degraded so as to take the place of those raised or lowered in

 the visible region, and the colour of the star would remain unchanged.

 About eight years later Fizeau pointed out the importance of considering
 the individual wave-lengths of which white light is composed. It is,
 indeed, Doppler's principle which underlies the early determination of
 the velocity of light by Roemer; but this method, in its converse form,

 can scarcely be regarded as of practical value for the motions in the line

 of sight of binary stars. As soon, however, as we had learned to
 recognise the lines of known substances in the spectra of the heavenly
 bodies, Doppler's principle became applicable as the basis of a new
 and most fruitful method of investigation. The measurement of the
 small shift of the celestial lines from their true positions, as shown
 by the same lines in the spectrum of a terrestrial substance, gives to
  us the means of ascertaining directly in miles per second the speed
  of approach or of recession of the heavenly body from which the light

  has come.

      An account of the first application of this method of research to
 the stars, which was made in my observatory in 1868, was given by Sir
 Gabriel Stokes from this chair at the meeting at Exeter in 1869. The
 stellar motions determined by me were shortly after confirmed by Pro-

 fessor Vogel in the case of Sirius, and in the case of other stars by Mr.
 ·Christie, now Astronomer Royal, at Greenwich ; but, necessarily, in con-
ADDEESS.  27

sequence of the inadequacy of the insti-nments then in use for so delicate
an inquiry, the amounts of these motions were but approximate.

     The method was shortly afterwards taken up systematically at Green-
wich and at the Rugby Observatory. It is to be greatly regretted that,
for some reasons, the results have not been sufficiently accordant and

accurate for a research of such exceptional delicacy. On this account

probably, as well as that the spectroscope at that early time had scarcely
become a familiar instrument in the observatory, astronomers were slow
in availing themselves of this new and remarkable power of investigation.
That this comparative neglect of so truly wonderful a method of ascertain-
ing what was otherwise outside our powers of observation has greatly
retarded the progress of astronomy during the last fifteen years, is but
too clearly shown by the brilliant results which within the last couple of
years have followed fast upon the recent masterly application of this
method by photography at Potsdam, and by eye with the needful accuracy
at the Lick Observatory. At last this use of the spectroscope has taken
its true place as one of the most potent methods of astronomical research.
 It gives us the motions of approach and of recession, not in angular
 measures, which depend for their translation into actual velocities upon
 separate determinations of parallactic displacements, but at once in

 terrestrial units of distance.

      This method of work will doubtless be very prominent in the astro-
 nomy of the near future, and to it probably we shall have to look for the
 more important discoveries in sidereal astronomy which will be made

 during the coming century.
      In his recent application of photography to this method of determining

 celestial motions, Professor Vogel, assisted by Dr. Scheiner, considering
 the importance of obtaining the spectrum of as many stars as possible on
 an extended scale without an exposure inconveniently long, wisely
 determined to limit the part of the spectrum on the plate to the region
 for which the ordinary silver-bromide gelatine plates are most sensitive,
  namely, to a small distance on each side of G, and to employ as the line

 ot comparison the hydrogen line near G, and recently also certain lines
 of iron. The most minute and complete mechanical arrangements were
  provided for the purpose of securing the absolute rigidity of the com-
  parison spectrum relatively to that of the star, and for permitting tem-
  perature adjustments and other necessary ones to be made, .

       The perfection of these spectra is shown by the large number of

  lines, no fewer than 250 in the case of Capella, within the small region

  of the spectrum on the plate. Already the motions of about fifty stars
  have been measured with an accuracy, in the case of the larger number

  of them, of about an English mile per second.
       At the Lick Observatory it has been shown that observations can be

  made directly by eye with an accuracy equally great. Mr. Keeler's

   brilliant success has followed in great measure from the use of the third
28 KEPORT 1891.

and fourth spectra of a grating with 14,438 lines to the inch. The mar-
Tellous accuracy attainable in his hands on a suitable star is shown by

observations on three nights of the star Arcturus, the largest divergence
of his measures being not greater than six-tenths of a mile per second,

while the mean of the three nights' work agreed with the mean of five
photographic determinations of the same star at Potsdam to within one-
tenth of an English mile. These are determinations of the motions of a
sun so stupendously remote that even the method of parallax practically
fails to fathom the depth of intervening space, and by means of light-
waves which have been, according to Elkin's nominal parallax, nearly
200 years upon their journey.

     Mr. Keeler with his magnificent means has accomplished a task
which I attempted in vain in 1874, with the comparatively poor appli-

ances at my disposal, of measuring the motions in the line of sight of

some of the planetary nebulas. As the stars have considerable motions
in space it was to be expected that nebulae should possess similar motions,
for tbe stellar motions must have belonged to the nebnlse out of which

they have been evolved. My instrumental means, limiting my power of

detection to motions greater than twenty-five miles per second, were in-
sufficient. Mr. Keeler has found in the examination of ten nebulae
motions varying from two miles to twenty-seven miles, with one excep-

tional motion of nearly forty miles.
     For the nebula of Orion, Mr. Keeler finds a motion of recession of

about ten miles a second. Now this motion agrees closely with what it

should appear to have from the drift of the solar system itself, so far as
it has been possible at present to ascertain the probable velocity of the
sun in space. This grand nebula, of vast extent and of extreme tenuity,
is probably more nearly at rest relatively to the stars of our system

than any other celestial object we know ; still it would seem more likely
that even here we have some motion, small though it may be, than that

the motions of the matter of which it is formed were so absolutely
balanced as to leave this nebula in the unique position of absolute immo-
bility in the midst of whirling and drifting suns and systems of suns.

     The spectroscopic method of determining celestial motions in the
line of sight has recently become fruitful in a new but not altogether un-
foreseen direction, for it has, so to speak, given us a separating power
far beyond that of any telescope the glass-maker and the optician could

construct, and so enabled us to penetrate into mysteries hidden in
stars apparently single, and altogether unsuspected of being binary
systems. The spectroscope has not simply added to the list of the

known binary stars, but has given to us for the first time a knowledge
of a new class of stellar systems, in which the components are in some
cases of nearly equal magnitude, and in close proximity, and are re-

volving with velocities greatly exceeding the planetary velocities of our

 system.
ADDRESS.  29

   KThe line in the photographs of Mizar, taken at the Harvard Col-

lege Observatory, was found to be double at intervals of fifty-two days.

The spectrum was therefore not due to a single source of light, but to
the combined effect of two stars moving periodically in opposite direc-

tions in the line of sight. It is obvious that if two stars revolve round
their common centre of gravity in a plane not perpendicular to the line
of si^ht, all the lines in a spectrum common to the two stars will appear

alternately single or double.

     In the case of Mizar and the other stars to be mentioned, the spec-
troscopic observations are not as yet extended enough to furnish more
than an approximate determination of the elements of tbeir orbits.

     Mizar especially, on account of its relatively long period, about 105
days, needs further observations. The two stars are moving each, with a
velocity of about fifty miles a second, probably in elliptical orbits, and
are about 143 millions of miles apart. The stars of about equal bright-
ness have together a mass about forty times as great as that of our sun.

   A similar doubling of the lines showed itself in the Harvard pboto-

graphs of yS Aurigse at the remarkably close interval of almost exactly
two days, indicating a period of revolution of about four days. Accord-
ing to Vogel's later observations, eacb star has a velocity of nearly seventy
miles a second, the distance between the stars being little more than
seven and a half millions of miles, and the mass of the system 4' 7 times
that of the sun. The system is approaching us at the speed of about

sixteen miles a second.

     The telescope could never have revealed to us double stars of this
order. In the case of /3 Auriga3, combining Vogel's distance with

Pritchard's recent determination of the star's parallax, the greatest
angular separation of the stars as seen from the earth would be l-200th
part of a second of arc, and therefore very far too small for detection

by the largest telescopes. If we take the relation of aperture to sepa-
rating power usually accepted, an object glass of about eighty feet in
diameter would be needed to resolve this binary star. The spectroscope,
which takes no note of distance, magnifies, so to speak, this minute

angular separation 4,000 times ; in other words, the doubling of the

lines, which is the phenomenon that we have to observe, amounts to the
easily measurable quantity of twenty seconds of arc.

     There were known, indeed, variable stars of short period, which it
had been suggested might be explained on the hypothesis of a dark
body revolving about a bright sun in a few days, but this theory was
met by the objection that no sacli systems of closely revolving suns were
known to exist.

     The Harvard photographs of which we have been speaking were
taken with a slitless form of spectroscope, the prisms being placed, as
originally by Fraunhofer, before the object glass of the telescope. This
method, though it possesses some advantages, has the serious drawback
30 REPOET-- 1891.

of not permitting a direct comparison of the star's spectrum with ter-

restrial spectra. It is obviously unsuited to a variable star like Algol,
where one star only is bright, for in such a case there would be no
doubling of the Hnes, but only a small shift to and fro in the spectrum

of the lines of the bright star as it moved in its orbit alternately towards
and from our system, which would need for its detection the fiducial

positions of terrestrial lines compared directly with them.
     For such observations the Potsdam spectrograph was well adapted.

Professor Vogel found that the bright star of Algol did pulsate back-

wards and forwards in the visual direction in a period corresponding to
the known variation of its light. The explanation which had been
suggested for the star's variability, that it was partially eclipsed at
regular intervals of 68'8 hours by a dark companion large enough to cut
off nearly five-sixths of its light, was therefore the true one. The dark
companion, no longer able to hide itself by its obscureness, was brought
out into the light of direct observation by means of its gravitational

effects.

     Seventeen hours before minimum Algol is receding at the rate of
about 24^ miles a second, while seventeen hours after minimum it is
found to be approaching with a speed of about 28^^ miles. Prom these

data, together with those of the variation of its light, Vogel found, on
the assumption that both stars have the same density, that the companion,
nearly as large as the sun, but with about one-fourth his mass, revolves
with a velocity of about fifty-five miles a second. The bright star of

about twice the size and mass moves about the common centre of gravity
with the speed of about twenty-six miles a second. The system of the two

stars, which are about 3;^ millions of miles apart, considered as a whole,
is approaching us with a velocity of 2-4 miles a second. The great
difference in luminosity of the two stars, not less than fifty times, suggests
rather that they are in different stages of condensation, and dissimilar in

density.

     It is obvious that if the orbit of a star with an obscure companion is
sufficiently inclined to the line of sight, the companion will pass above or
below the bright star and produce no variation of its light. Such systems

may be numerous in the heavens. In Vogel's photographs, Spica, which is

not variable, by a small shifting of its lines reveals a backward and forward
periodical pulsation due to orbital motion. As the pair whirl round
their common centre of gravity, the bright star is sometimes advancing,
at others receding. They revolve in about four days, each star moving
with a velocity of about fifty-six miles a second in an orbit probably
nearly circular, and possess a combined mass of rather more than 2^
times that of the sun. Taking the most probable value for the star's
parallax, the greatest angular separation of the stars would be far too
small to be detected with the most powerful telescopes.

     If in a close double star the fainter companion is of the white-star
ADDRESS.  31

type, while the bright star is solar in character, the composite spectrum
would be solar with the hydrogen lines unusually strong. Such a spec-
trum would in itself afford some probability of a double origin, and
suggest the existence of a companion star.

     In the case of a true binary star the orbital motions of the pair would
reveal themselves in a small periodical swaying of the hydrogen lines

relatively to the solar ones.

     Professor Pickering considers that his photographs show ten stars
with composite spectra ; of these, five are known to be double. The
others are : t Persei, I AurigiB, 8 Sagittarii, 31 Ceti, and /3 Capricorni.
Perhaps ^ Ljrae should be added to this list.

     In his recent classical work on the rotation of the sun, Duner has
not only determined the solar rotation for the equator but for different
parallels of latitude up to 75°. The close accordance of his results shows
that these observations are suflBciently accurate to be discussed with the
variation of the solar rotation for different latitudes, which had been
determined by the older astronomical methods from the observations of

the solar spots.

     Though I have already spoken incidentally of the invaluable aid
which is furnished by photography in some of the applications of the
spectroscope to the heavenly bodies, the new power which modern
photography has put into the hands of the astronomer is so great, and
has led already, within the last few years, to new acquisitions of know-
ledge of such vast importance, that it is fitting that a few sentences
should be specially devoted to this subject.

     Photography is no new discovery, being about half a century old
it may excite surprise, and indeed possibly suggest some apathy on the
part of astronomers, that though the suggestion of the application of
photography to the heavenly bodies dates from the memorable occasion
when, in 1839, Arago, announcing to the Academie des Sciences the great
discovery of Niepce and Daguerre, spoke of the possibility of taking
pictures of the sun and moon by the new process, jet that it is only
within a few years that notable advances in astronomical methods and
discovery have been made by its aid.

     The explanation is to be found in the comparative unsuitability of
the earlier photographic methods for use in the observatory. Injustice

to the early workers in astronomical photography, among whom Bond,
De la Rue, J. W. Draper, Rutherfurd, Gould, hold a foremost place, it is

needful to state clearly that the recent great successes in astronomical
photography are not due to greater skill, nor, to any great extent, to

superior instruments, but to the very great advantages which the modern
gelatine dry plate possesses for use in the observatory over the methods
of Dnguerre, and even over the wet collodion film on glass which, though
a fr eat advance on the silver plate, went but a little way towards putting-
32 BEPORT-- 1891.

into the hands of the astronomer a photographic surface adapted fully to

his wants.

The modern silver-bromide gelatine plate, except for its grained

texture, meets the needs of the astronomer at all points. It possesses

extreme sensitiveness ; it is always ready for use ; it can be placed in any

position ;  it can be exposed  for  hours                             lastly, it does not need immediate
                                                                   ;

development, and for this reason can be exposed again to the same

object on succeeding nights, so as to make up by several instalments, as the

weather may permit, the total time of exposure which is deemed necessary.

Without the assistance of photography, however greatly the resources

of genius might overcome the optical and mechanical diflBculties of con-

structing large telescopes, the astronomer would have to depend in the

last resource upon his eye. Now we cannot by the force of continued

looking bring into view an object too feebly luminous to be seen at the
first and keenest moment of vision. But the feeblest light which falls
upon the plate is not lost, but is taken in and stored up continuously.
Bach hour the plate gathers up 3,600 times the light-energy which
it received during the first second. It is by this power of accumu-

lation that the photographic plate may be said to increase, almost

without limit, though not in separating power, the optical means at the

disposal of the astronomer for the discovery or the observation of faint

objects.

    Two principal directions may be pointed out in which photography is

of great service to the astronomer. It enables him within the compara-

tively short time of a single exposure to secure permanently with great

exactness the relative positions of hundreds or even of thousands of stars,
or the minute features of nebulas or other objects, or the phenomena
of a passing eclipse, tasks which by means of the eye and hand could

only be accomplished, if at all, after a very great expenditure of time
and labour. Photography puts it in the power of the astronomer to

accomplish in the short span of his own life, and so enter into their
fruition, great works which otherwise must have been passed on by him
as an heritage of labour to succeeding generations.

     The second great service which photography renders is not simply an
aid to the powers the astronomer already possesses. On the contrary,
the plate, by recording light-waves which are both too small and too
large to excite vision in the eye, brings him into new regions of know-
ledge, such as the infra-red and the ultra-violet parts of the spectrum,
which must have remained for ever unknown but for artificial help.

     The present year will be memorable in astronomical history for the
practical beginning of the Photographic Chart and Catalogue of the
Heavens, which took their origin in an International Conference which
met in Paris in 1887, by the invitation of M. I'Amiral Mouchez, Director
of the Paris Observatory.

The richness in stars down to the ninth magnitude of the photographs

of the comet of 1882 taken at the Cape Observatory under the superin-

tendence of Dr. Gill, and the remarkable star charts of the Brothers

Henry which followed two years later, astonished the astronomical world.

The great excellence of these photographs, which was due mainly to the

superiority of the gelatine plate, suggested to these astronomers a complete

map of the sky, and a little later gave birth in the minds of the Paris

astronomers to the grand enterprise of an International Chart of the

Heavens. The actual beginning of tlTe work this year is in no small

degree due to the great energy and tact with which the Director of the

Paris Observatory has conducted the initial steps, through the many

delicate and difficult questions which have unavoidably presented them-

selves in an undertaking which depends upon the harmonious working in

common of many nationalities, and of no fewer than eighteen observa-

tories in all parts of the world. The three years since 1887 have not

been too long for the detailed organisation of this work, which has

called for several elaborate preliminary investigations on special points

in which our knowledge was insufficient, and which have been ably

carried out by Professors Vogel and Bakhuyzen, Dr. Trepied, Dr. Scheiner,

Dr. Gill, the Astronomer Royal, and others. Time also was required for

the construction of the new and special instruments.

The decisions of the Conference in their final form provide for the

construction of a great photographic chart of the heavens with exposures

corresponding to forty minutes' exposure at Paris, which it is expected

win reach down to stars of about the fourteenth magnitude. As each

plate is to be limited to four square degrees, and as each star, to

avoid possible errors, is to appear on two plates, over 22,000 photographs

will be required. For the more accurate determination of the positions
of the stars, a reseau with lines at distances of 5 mm. apart is to be

previously impressed by a faint light upon the plate, so that the image
of the reseau will appear together with the images of the stars when the

plate is developed. This great work will be divided, according to their

latitudes, among eighteen observatories provided with similar instru-

ments, though not necessarily constructed by the same maker. Those

in the British dominions and at Tacubaya have been constructed by Sir

Howard Grubb.

Besides the plates to form the great chart, a second set of plates for a

catalogue is to be taken, with a shorter exposure, which will give stars to

the eleventh magnitude only. These plates, by a recent decision of the

Permanent Committee, are to be pushed on as actively as possible, though

as far as may be practicable plates for the chart are to be taken concur-

rently. Photographing the plates for the catalogue is but the first step

in this work, and only supplies the data for the elaborate measurements

which have to be made, which are, however, less laborious than would

be required for a similar catalogue without the aid of photography.

Already Dr. Gill has nearly brought to conclusion, with the assistance

of Professor Kapteyn, a preliminary photograpliic survey of the Southern

VipOTTOTlg

     With an exposure sufficiently long for the faintest stars to impress
themselves upon the plate, the accumulating action still goes on for the
brighter stars, producing a great enlargement of their images from opti-
cal and photographic causes. The question has occupied the attention of
many astronomers whether it is possible to find a law connecting the
diameters of these more or less over-exposed images with the relative
brightness of the stars themselves. The answer will come out undoubt-
edly in the afiarmative, though at present the empirical formulae which
have been suggested for this purpose differ from each other. Captain
Abney proposes to measure the total photographic action, including
density as well as size, by the obstruction which the stellar image offers

to light.

   A further question follows as to the relation which the photographic

magnitudes of stars bear to those determined by eye. Visual magnitudes
are the physiological expression of the eye's integration of that part of
the star's light which extends from the red to the blue. Photographic
magnitudes represent the plate's integration of another part of the star's

--light namely, from a little below where the power of the eye leaves off

in the blue, to where the light is cut off by the glass, or is greatly re-
duced by want of proper corrections when a refracting telescope is used.
It is obvious that the two records are taken by different methods in
dissimilar units of different parts of the star's light. In the case of cer-
tain coloured stars the photographic brightness is very different from the
visual brightness ; but in all stars changes, especially of a temporary cha-

racter, may occur in the photographic or the visual region, unaccompanied

by similar changes in the other part of the spectrum. For these reasons
it would seem desirable that the two sets of magnitudes should be tabu-

lated independently, and be regarded as supplementary of each other.

     The determination of the distances of the fixed stars from the small

apparent shift of their positions when viewed from widely separated posi-

tions of the earth in its orbit is one of the most refined operations of the

observatory. The great precision with which this minute angulai

quantity, a fraction of a second of arc only, has to be measured, is so deli-

cate an operation with the ordinary micrometer, though, indeed, it was with

this instrument that the classical observations of Sir Robert Ball were

made, that a special instrument, in which the measures are made by

moving the two halves of a divided object glass, known as a heliometer,

has been pressed into this service, and quite recently, in the skilful hands

of Dr. Gill and Dr. Elkin, has largely increased our knowledge in this

direction.

    It is obvious that photography might be here of great service, if we

could rely upon measurements of photographs of the same stars taken at

suitable intervals of time. Professor Pritchard, to whom is due the
              ADDRESS.                                                               35

honour of having opened this new path, aided by his assistants, has
proved by elaborate investigations that measures for parallax may be

safely made upon photographic plates, with, of course, the advantages of

leisure and repetition ; and he has already by this method determined the
parallax for twenty-one stars with an accuracy not inferior to that of

values previously obtained by purely astronomical methods.

The remarkable successes of astronomical photography, which depend

upon the plate's power of accumulation of a very feeble light acting

continuously through an exposure of several hours, are worthy to be re-

garded as a new revelation. The first chapter opened when, in 1880, Dr.

Henry Draper obtained a picture of the nebula of  Orion                              but a more im-
                                                                                  ;

portant advance was made in 1883, when Dr. Common, by his photographs,

brought to our knowledge details and extensions of this nebula hitherto

Aunknown.    further disclosure took place in 1885, when the Brothers

Henry showed for the first time in great detail the spiral nebulosity issu-

ing from the bright star Maia of the Pleiades, and shortly afterwards

nebulous streams about the other stars of this group. In 1886 Mr.

Roberts, by means of a photograph to which three hours' exposure had

been given, showed the whole background of this group to be nebulous.

In the following year Mr. Roberts more than doubled for us the great

extension of the nebular region which surrounds the trapezium in the

constellation of Orion. By his photographs of the great nebula in An-

dromeda, he has shown the true significance of the dark canals which

had been seen by the eye. They are in reality spaces between successive

rings of bright matter, which appeared nearly straight owing to the in-

clination in which they lie relatively to us. These bright rings surround

an undefined central luminous mass. I have already spoken of this

photograph.

Some recent photographs by Mr. Russell show that the great rift in

Waythe Milky  in Argus, which to the eye is void of stars, is in reality

uniformly covered with them. Also quite recently Mr. George Hale has

photographed the solar prominences by means of a grating, making use

Hof the lines and K.

     The heavens are richly but very irregularly inwrought with stars.
The brighter stars cluster into well-known groups upon a background
formed of an enlacement of streams and convoluted windings and inter-
twined spirals of fainter stars, which becomes richer and more intricate in
the irregularly rifted zone of the Milky Way.

    We, who form part of the emblazonry, can only see the design dis-

torted and confused here crowded, there scattered, at another place
                                                                                                                  ;

superposed. The groupings due to our position are mixed up with those
which are real.

     Can we suppose that each luminous point has no other relation to
those near it than the accidental neighbourship of grains of sand upon

                                                                                                                  B2

the shore, or of particles of the wind-blown dust of the desert ? Surely

every star from Sirius and Vega down to each grain of the light-dust of

the Milky Way has its present place in the heavenly pattern from the

Weslow evolving of its past.                              see a system of systems, for the broad

features of clusters and streams and spiral windings which mark the

general design are reproduced in every part. The whole is in motion,

each point shifting its position by miles every second, though from the

august magnitude of their distances from us and from each other, it is

only by the accumulated movements of years or of generations that some

small changes of relative position reveal themselves.

The deciphering of this wonderfully intricate constitution of the

heavens will be undoubtedly one of the chief astronomical works of the

coming century. The primary task of the sun's motion in space together

with the motions of the brighter stars has been already put well within

our reach by the spectroscopic method of the measurement of star-motions

in the line of sight.

From other directions information is accumnlating : from photographs

of clusters and parts of the Milky Way, by Roberts in this country,

Barnard  at  the  Lick  Observatory,                      and Russell  at    Sydney                                      from  the  count-

ing of stars, and the detection of their configurations, by Holden and by

Backhouse ; from the mapping of the Milky Way by eye, at Parsonstown ;

from photographs of the spectra of stars, by Pickering at Harvard and in

Peru ; and from the exact portraiture of the heavens in the great interna-

tional star chart which begins this year.
     I have but touched some only of the problems of the newer side of

astronomy. Of the many others which would claim our attention if

time permitted I may name the following. The researches of the Earl of
Rosse on lunar radiation, and the work on the same subject and on the

sun, by Langley. Observations of lunar heat with an instrument of his

own  invention    by  Mr.  Boys                           and  observations  of  the  variation                                     of the-
                                                       ;

moon's heat with its phase by Mr. Frank Very. The discovery of the

nltra- violet part of the hydrogen spectrum, not in the laboratory, but from,

the stars. The confirmation of this spectrum by terrestrial hydrogen in

part by H. W. Vogel, and in its all but complete form by Cornu, who

found similar series in the ultra-violet spectra of aluminium and thallium.
The discovery of a simple formula for the hydrogen series by Balmer. The

important question as to the numerical spectral relationship of difierent-

substances, especially in connection with their chemical properties ; and

the further question as to the origin of the harmonic and other relation*

between the lines and the groupings of lines of spectra ; on these points
contributions during the past year have been made by Rudolf v. Kove-

sligethy, Ames, Hartley, Deslandres, Rydberg, Griinwald, Kayser and

Runge, Johnstone Stoney, and others. The remarkable employment of
interference phenomena by Professor Michelson for the determination of
the size, and distribution of light within them, of the images of objects

spectral lines, and other questions of molecular physics.

     Along the older lines there has not been less activity ; by newer
methods, by the aid of larger or more accurately constructed instruments,
by greater refinement of analysis, knowledge has been increased, especially
in precision and minute exactness.

     Astronomy, the oldest of the sciences, has more than renewed her
youth. At no time in the past has she been so bright with unbounded
aspirations and hopes. Never were her temples so numerous, nor the
crowd of her votaries so great. The British Astronomical Association
formed within the year numbers already about 600 members. Happy is
the lot of those who are still on the eastern side of life's meridian !

     Already, alas ! the original founders of the newer methods are falling

-- Dout Kirchhoff, Angstrom, 'Arrest, Secchi, Draper, Becquerel ; but

their places are more than filled ; the pace of the race is gaining, but the

goal is not and never will be in sight.
     Since the time of Newton our knowledge of the phenomena of Nature

has wonderfully increased, but man asks, perhaps more earnestly now
than then, what is the ultimate reality behind the reality of the per-
ceptions ? Are they only the pebbles of the beach with which we have

been playing ? Does not the ocean of ultimate reality and truth lie beyond ?

                               First Conference, Septembee 4.

     The chair was taken by Mr. G. J. Symons, F.R.S., the Corresponding
Societies Committee being also represented by Professor T. G. Bonney,
F.R.S., Mr. W. Topley, F.R.S., Mr. J. Hopkinson, F.L.S., and Professor
R. Meldola, F.R.S. (Secretary).

     The Chairman proposed that the report of the Corresponding Societies
Committee to the General Committee, printed copies of which had been
distributed among the Delegates, should be taken as read. This was put
to the meeting and carried unanimously. The subjects dealt with in the
report were then taken in order.

                                                    Section A.

     Temperature Variation in Lakes, Bivers, and Estitaries.--The Chair-
man stated that in connection with the work of this Committee, of which
Dr. H. R. Mill was the Secretary, a large number of thermometers had

head-quarters in the place of meeting to send up this number of representatives.
COREESPONDING SOCIETIES.  43

been distributed throughout the country, and a good deal of information
had been collected during the year. It was proposed to ask for the
reappointment of the Committee with a grant to enable the observations

to be tabulated.

     Mr. William Watts stated that he had been conducting temperature
observations in two large reservoirs belonging to the Oldham Corporation
during the last eighteen months. These results were included in the
report of the Committee. Mr. Watts added that there was some pro-
bability of the observations having to be discontinued for want of funds,
although on his own part he was perfectly willing to carry on the work

for another year.
     Mr. Cushing presented a record of weekly temperature observations

taken in the River Wandle in Surrey. The temperatures were taken
between 3 and 3.30 p.m. on Sunday afternoons, and extended from
October 1888 to February 1890. The observations were taken at ten
different stations, five of which are on the Carshalton and five on the
Croydon branch of the river. The tabulated records were accompanied
by a statement of the mean weekly shade temperature and the rainfall for
the previous week, both being made up to 9 p.m. on the Saturday. The
tables were also accompanied by a sketch of the district traced from the
25-inch Ordnance map, showing the positions of all the stations, which
were numbered from 1 to 10, and which corresponded with the positions
in the temperature tables as read from left to right. The river is very
shallow, but the tables showed some rather large mean differences ot
temperature. While stations 1, 8, and 9 showed respectively the mean
differences of 15-8, 16-2, and 177° F. ; station No. 5, where the water
is only 18 inches deep, shows a mean yearly variation of only 0'7° F.,
while the mean variation of shade temperature during the same period
was 38"7° F. These tempei'atures were taken at from 12 to 18 inches
below the surface with a thermometer graduated on the stem and verified
at Kew. The observations had been taken by Mr. F. C. Bayard, an active
Fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society and Secretary to the Croydon
Microscopical and Natural History Club, which Society was represented
by Mr. Cushing at the Conference. Mr. Bayard had expressed his

willingness to continue the observations.

     The Secretary suggested that the results presented by Mr. Cushing
should be handed to Dr. Mill, the Secretary of the Committee.

     The Chairman, having commented on the value of Mr. Bayard's
observations, proceeded to state that he had recently been reducing
experiments with respect to evaporation, which had been made during
several years at Strathfield Turgiss in Hampshire, in which the ordinary
small evaporators had been compared with a galvanised iron tank 6 feet
square and 2 feet deep. The rough result was that the evaporation from
the tank averaged about 15 inches per anniim, while the smaller ones
(owing to the high temperature of the water) indicated an evapoi'ation

--considerably in excess of the truth.
     Meteorological Photography Mr. Hopkinson alluded to the success
which had been achieved by the Committee on Geological Photography,
of which Mr. Jeffs was Secretary, and pointed out the growing import-

ance of photography as an aid in other branches of scientific research.

He suggested that the idea might be extended to meteorological photo-

graphy, and that a Committee should be formed for carrying out this
object. Photography could be advantageously applied to the investiga-
44 REPORT 1891.

tion of meteorological plaeuomena such as the forms of clouds, lightning
flashes, the effects of storms, &c. It would be the function of such a
Committee to collect the photographs and keep a register of them, which
would be added to from year to year. The study of the forms of clouds
would be more satisfactory if undertaken by a comparison of photographs
than by di-awings. Mr. Hopkinson referred to the practical difficulty of
photographing light clouds in a blue sky, and suggested that it might
form part of the work of the Committee to investigate methods for
eflecting this object. With respect to lightning flashes he stated that
numerous photographs had been taken, some of which were very valuable,
but others were useless owing to the failure on the part of the photographer
to indicate the position of the plate in the camera. The advisabiHty of
interesting the Corresponding Societies in the work was pointed out to

the Delegates by Mr. Hopkinson, who also urged the special necessity of
securing as soon as possible photographs showing the after-efi'ects of
storms. It was proposed that a Committee of the Association with a
small grant should be formed through Section A. If this Committee were
sanctioned Mr. Symons and Professor Meldola would consent to serve on
it, and Mr. A. W. Clayden, who had made a special study of the
photography of clouds and lightning flashes, would be willing to act as

 Secretary.

     After some discussion as to the mode of procedure it was decided that

Aapplication should be made through the Committee of Section for the

formation of a Committee on Meteorological Photography, and that
the application should be also supported by a recommendation from the
Conference of Delegates to the Committee of Recommendations.

                                                     Section C.

   --Sea Coast Erosion. Mr. Topley stated that the Committee appointed

for this purpose would be glad to receive any as.sistance. Some of the
Corresponding Societies had applied for forms, but nothing had as yet
been done. Three years ago the Isle of Man Society had proposed to
take the matter in hand and form a Committee. He believed some of the
Yorkshire Societies were doing good work, but they had not yet received

--the results.
      Erratic Blocks. The Rev. B. P. Knubley stated, with reference to
 the work of this Committee, that the Yorkshire Naturalists' Union had
 been caiTying on the records satisfactorily, and that about twenty-five
 reports had been presented during the year. These had been sent to Dr.
 Crosskey, the Secretary of the Committee.

   --Oeological Photography. Mr. O. W. Jeff's stated that, through the

 action of the Conference of Delegates at previous meetings of the British
 Association, a Committee had been appointed for collecting and reporting
 on geological photographs. Very material assistance had been rendered
 to the work of this Committee by various Delegates from the several

 Corresponding Societies, many of which had sent photographs or lists of
 those that had been taken. All that had been done thus far was of a
 preliminary character, and had consisted in arranging the photographs
 which had been taken in order to select those which illustrated well-
 defined strata or sections. The work was by no means complete, and the
 report, which would shortly be presented, showed that a very large
CORRESPONDING SOCIETIEji.                                        45'

proportion of the counties of England and Wales were as yet un-
represented. Mr. JeS's asked those Delegates who had not yet done so to

brino- the matter before their Societies, and to interest their photographic
members in the work. The object of the Committee was to secure "hj

systematic action in the various districts a series of photographs illustra-

tino- the features which geologists thought most worthy of being recorded
in their respective localities. The only portion of England where the
scheme had been .carried out to any extent was Yorkshire. The York-

shire Naturalists' Union had adopted the photographic method, and had
taken over 100 negatives. Mr. Hopkinson had brought the subject before

the Hertfordshire Natural History Society, and he hoped to receive

Aphotographs from them shortly.       large number of the photographs

which had been I'eceived would be exhibited in the room of Section C,

and Mr. Jeffs invited the Delegates to inspect them. He added that the

Committee would be glad to receive any suggestions from the Delegates.

--The counties from which photographs had been received were : Dorset-

shire, Cornwall (very few), Devonshire (very few), Isle of Man (several),

Kent, Lancashire, Montgomeryshire, Nottmgham, a few from North

Wales, Suffolk, and Shropshire, a large number from Yorkshire, and

some from Scotland and Ireland. The list was manifestly very incom-

plete, and he hoped that by next year's Report it would be considerably

extended. Copies of the circular of instructions issued by the Committee

were circulated among the Delegates.

Professor Lebour asked if any steps had been taken with respect to

the keeping of the photographs.

Mr. Jeffs said that this matter had not yet been discussed by their

Committee. They intended to keep the photographs until the collection

had assumed a more complete form. A suggestion had been made to

render some of the best examples more available to the Delegates and to

the public, and more especially to those requiring them for educational

purposes, by issuing them in the form of a publication, but the matter

had not yet been properly discussed.

Professor Bonney said that, as a member of the Committee on geo-

logical photography, he was enabled to state that the work had hitherto

been necessarily of a preliminary nature, and had been carried out by the

zeal and energy of Mr. Jeffs. The question of publication would come

before the Committee later on, and, speaking on his own behalf, he con-

sidered it of great importance that some step in this direction should be

taken. He expressed the opinion that the best destination of the photo-

graphs would be to lodge them with the Geulogical Society if they would

receive them. If an enlarged photograph were required for educational

purposes, the negative could then be borrowed for the purpose. It would,

of course, be a year or two before the photographs would be accessible.

When a large collection had been accumulated, it would be most useful

to select some thirty or forty of the more typical examples of geological

phenomena and to have them enlarged for publica'ion. Professor Bonney

expressed the opinion that, for the purposes of teaching, enlarged photo-

graphs would be better than photographs taken on a large scale.

The discussion was continued by Mr. W. Watts and Mr. Eli Sower-

butts. The suggestions put forward by Professor Bonney were approved

of, and it was pointed out that it would be desirable that the Correspond-

ing Societies should have a list of the photographs already sent in to the

Committee, in order to know which were wanted and which were not..
--46 REPORT 1891.

 Many members of the Mancliester Geographical Society had been taking

 photographs, and in time a large number of negatives would be collected,

 which the owners would, no doubt, be willing to place at the disposal of
 the Committee if it were known that they would be safely deposited in

 some accessible place, and a record giving the source and locality of each

 negative also kept.

       Mr. Jeffs stated in reply that a list of the views which had been
 received would be kept, and also a register for entering the name of the

 person responsible for borrowing a negative. He suggested that the
 Committee might make arrangements with some photographer for pre-

 paring lantern slides from the photographs at a fixed charge, for the

 purpose of lecture illustration. With respect to the photographs taken

 by the members of the Manchester Geographical Society, Mr. Jeffs said

 that their Committee would be very pleased to receive them whenever

 they were sent.

      Mr. William Gray stated that he was interested in the subject of

 geological photography in the North of Ireland, and he approved of the

 scheme put forward by the Committee, of which Mr. Jeffs was the Secre-

 tary. He had succeeded in securing a few photographs, which were

 sufficient to show the value of the method both as applied to this subject

and to the erosion of the sea-coast. He expressed the opinion that it

 would be an advantage if each Delegate were appointed as the local repre-
 sentative of the Committee in his own district, and authorised to collect

the photographs. There were many members of his society (Belfast
 Naturalists' Field Club) who had done a great deal of photographic work,
 but there was some amount of hesitation in forwarding negatives to the

 British Association Committee, which he thought would be got over if there
 were some person in the society directly authorised to collect the photo-
 graphs. Mr. Gray expressed his willingness to act in this capacity for

the North of Ireland. He alluded also to the advantage of being able to

get the photographs reproduced in the form of lantern slides, and stated
 that, if such slides were required for illustrating the physical features of
the North of Ireland, he would be able to see that they were supplied at
a reasonable price. Mr. A. Tate, on behalf of the Belfast Natural History
and Philosophical Society, expressed similar views.

      Professor Meldola pointed out that, in taking photographs of geological
sections, in which differences in the strata were often indicated only by
small differences in colour, it would be an advantage to use orthochro-
naatic plates. The colour differences were sometimes so slight, that the
differentiation of strata would be imperceptible in an ordinary photo-
graph, and he therefore expressed the hope that the Committee in their

schedule of instructions would see their way to recommend the adoption
of these plates, which, although somewhat more costly than ordinary

Aplates, would give such superior results as to warrant their use.
          further discussion took place respecting the desirability of adopting

some means by which members of the British Association, and those who

assisted in the work, would be enabled to procure copies of the photo-
graphs either as lantern slides, prints, or enlargements. Mr. Symons
suggested that the best plan would be for those members requiring copies
to be allowed the temporary loan of the negative itself, while lantern
slides should be prepared by some recognised person under the immediate
direction of the Secretary of the Committee. In reply to a question by
Mr. M. H. Mills as to whether any underground photographs had been
COEEESPONDING SOCIETIES.  47

taken, and if so, whethei- they bad proved to be of any value, Mr. Jeffs
stated that no photographs of underground sections had yet been received.

                                                Section D.

   --Disappearance of Native Plants. Professor Hillhouse distributed

among the Delegates copies of the third report of the Committee on
this subject. He stated that the report had this year been confined to
the North of England, the Isle of Man, and to a few records from the
southern counties of Wales. The bulk of the material had been obtained

directly by correspondence with the loCal Natural History Societies.
The Committee were especially indebted to the Yorkshire Naturalists'

Union, which had formed a committee of their own, the labours of this

committee having largely contributed to the satisfactory results which
had been obtained. There was still a certain amount of difficulty in
inducing the representatives of the societies, to which circu^lars had been
sent, to take steps in the matter, and he expressed a hope that the Dele-
gates would do their best to promote the objects of the Committee.
Although the Committee had not yet come to any definite decision, he
thought that next year's report would probably deal with the whole of
Wales, and possibly adjoining counties, and with the south-western

counties of England, and Delegates from these districts were asked to
bear this in mind.

      Professor Hillhouse then gave a resume of the report which had been
presented, stating that it contained an account of the more or less com-
plete disappearance from the localities mentioned therein of about seventy
species. In some cases the disappearance had been due to natural causes
e.g., the encroachments of the sea on the Cumberland coast and elsewhere
had brought about the disappearance of several littoral plants ; but in
the great majority the handiwork of man had been recognisable. Dis-

--appearance through human agency he classified under two heads per-

sonal and impersonal. Impersonal action he illustrated by the results of
building works, agricultural operations, drainage, &c., which cause con-

stant changes in local floras. Thus the Isle of Man Brassica (B. monensis),
first found by the famous botanist John Ray at the Moiragh, Ramsey, in

1670, is in danger of extirpation there, and has already been extirpated
at Douglas by building operations ; and the commonest of the scarlet
poppies (Papaver rliceas) is greatly diminishing in the county of Cumber-
land through the gradual abandonment of cereal tillage. It is only
incidentally, however, that these impersonal changes affect plants of

--special interest, while the personal actions of man that is, his actions
--directed intentionally at some particular plant have naturally their chief

influence upon plants of peculiar interest or beauty. Here again, as in
previous reports, it is the ' collecting dealer ' whose ravages form the
main burden of complaint. The Ladies' Slipper orchid (Oypripedium
Calceolus), once not uncommon in Yorkshire, Durham, and Westmoreland,
has well-nigh succumbed, and the hillsides, banks, and hedgerows are
being rapidly stripped of their once abundant fei'ns. As an example of
the systematic way in which this is done. Professor Hillhouse instanced
the case of the Maiden Hair (Adiantum Capillus-veneris), which in the Isle

of Man is regularly hunted for by men with boats and ladders, and sold
to ' trippers ' in the Douglas market. He thought that the local Natural
48 REPORT 1891.

History Societies might do a great deal towards persuading holiday
makers and tourists that it is far better, far safer, and, in the long run,
far cheaper, to buy these plants from nurserymen who grow them, than
to incur the trouble, expense, and risk of removing tbem at a time when
the conditions are so unfavourable as they are during practically tbe
holiday season, and that they might do something towards restraining

the robbers themselves.
      Mr. Hopkinson stated that nearly the whole of the ferns in his dis-

trict (St. Albans) had disappeared within the last twenty years. He

attributed the extermination to the London collectors and dealers, and
added that there was a danger of such a common plant as the prim-
rose becoming exterminated in time from the London district, as they

were taken to the metropolis by cartloads every year.
      Mr. Sowerbutts called attention to the inefficacy of the law of trespass

in such cases, as no penalty can be inflicted unless damage is proved.

He considered the worst depredator to be the botanical fanatic.

      Mr. Gray did not think that the true botanist would be guilty of such
wilful destruction. Tbey had a special rule among their Society that no
rare plant should be damaged or removed. One class of offenders to be
 dealt with were the persons who, without any knowledge of the habits of
a rare species, liked to see it growing about their premises, and for this
reason had it removed. If these persons were taught that it is often
impossible for such plants to live away from their natural conditions their
depredations might perhaps be checked.

     Mr. M. B. Slater said that he had known many lovers of plants in his
district (Malton) who would tramp many miles in search of a rare species.
Although in a sense these men were botanical fanatics he did not think
that they were the depredators. It was the young beginner in the study

of botany who, in his opinion, should be cautioned against exterminating

any rare plant in his anxiety to procure specimens. He suggested that

the best plan would be to endeavour to procure at the proper time a little
ripe seed from the plant in its native habitat, and then to try and raise
it. This would be the means of saving from destruction some of our
greatest rarities. Mr. Slater had adopted this plan himself, and had
growing under cultivation some of the rarer and most interesting of

British plants. He believed the extension of agriculture to have been

one great cause of the disappearance of local species, and by obtaining
seeds, or even in extreme cases the plants themselves, some species might
be saved from destruction. Although some practical difficulties might be
encountered, he thought that with perseverance these would be overcome,
and the student would certainly derive great advantage from trying to
cultivate his plants. If successful he would thus attain a far better
knowledge of their life histories, as he would be enabled to watch the
plants through their various stages of growth.

     Investigation of the Invert ehrate Fauna and Cryptogamic Flora of the
British Isles.^The Rev. E. P. Knubley stated that no formal report of the
work of this Committee had been presented to the Section, but that the
Yorkshire Naturalists' Union had been steadily carrying on the work
during the past year.

                                                    Section E.

     Mr. Sowerbutts made some remarks with respect to the scope of
Geography, and suggested that detached papers on the geology, zoology,
meteorology, botany, &c., of some particular region could be regarded ns
coming under this science, and might with advantage be read together in
a common Section-room. The discussion was continued by Professor
Bonney, who considered the suggestion worthy of consideration, bub
likely to meet with great practical difi&culties.

  --Flameless Explosives for use in Goal Mines. Professor Leoour stated

that the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers
were about to make experiments on this subject. They had recently
obtained a grant of 300Z. for the experiments, but more would be re-

quired. He appealed to other engineering societies represented at the

Conference to co-operate in the investigation, which was of such general
importance in mining districts.

     Mr. Mills said that the Chesterfield and Midland Counties Institute
had not taken the matter up through their Council, but several indi-
vidual members had been working at it, and the results would shortly be

published.

                                               Section H.

   --Catalogue of Prehistoric Remains. Mr. Kenward said that the Bir-

mingham Philosophical Society was fully alive to the importance of
recording the few ancient remains in their district. He had done a great
deal of work in this direction himself, and had induced others to promote
the suggestions discussed at the Conferences at Bath and Newcastle, as

well as to assist in carrying out the Archseological survey proposed by
the Society of Antiquaries.'

     Mr. Gray stated that the Belfast Naturalists' Field Club had takeu
the matter up in a systematic way, and would continue their co-opera-

tion.

     At the conclusion of the Conference the Chairman remarked upon the
advantage of being able to have at hand for reference the publications of
the local Societies as collected by the Corresponding Societies Committee
for the purpose of preparing the catalogue of papers which formed part

of their annual report. He also called attention to the fact that a few of

the older and well-known local Societies had not yet become enrolled as
Corresponding Societies.

     Professor Meldola pointed out that this matter had already been dis-
cussed at a previous conference (Bath, 1888) as well as by their Com-

mittee in London. He thought that the work of the Conference of

Delegates was row sufficiently well known, and that, althougli there were
 a few societies whose co-operation it would be extremely desirable to
 secure, no further approach could be made on the part of the Committee.

 It rested rather with the Delegates themselves to assist in securing the

 Societies in their own districts.

                               Second Conference, September 9.

      The chair was taken by Mr. G, J. Symons, F.R.S., the Corresponding

Societies Committee being also represented by Sir Rawson Raw son,

 Dr. Garson, Mr. Hopkinson, and Professor R. Meldola,F.R.S. (Secretary).

                                                      Section A.

   --Phenological Observations. Mr. Symons made the following com-

munication :

     ' Phenological observations, which may perhaps be said to have origi-

 nated with Gilbert White, although studied with care in Austria, received

little attention in England until 1874, when the Royal Meteorological
 Society invited and obtained the assistance of Delegates from the Royal
Agricultural Society, Royal Horticultural Society, Royal Botanic Society,
Royal Dublin Society, and Marlborough College Natural History Society,
who held several meetings, and eventually drew up an elaborate report,
which, curiously enough, upon re-examining after the lapse of sixteen
years, seems to show that practically few of the Delegates approved of
it, although from motives of politeness they allowed it to pass. Flowering
 plants, insects, and birds were referred respectively to the Rev. T. A.
 Preston, Mr. McLachlan, and Professor Newton. Of plants the large
number of seventy-one were recommended for observation, of insects only
 eight, and of birds seventeen. Mr. McLachlan, Professor Newton, Mr. Bell
 of Selborne, and Professor Thiselton Dyer all expressed the opinion that
 the list should be kept as short as possible, and although Mr. Preston's
 long list of plants was retained, it was resolved that special attention
 should be called to fifteen out of the seventy-one, by printing their names

 in capitals.

      ' The Royal Meteorological Society undertook the cost and trouble of
 preparing and issuing the necessary forms, and from 1875 to 1888, both
 inclusive, the Rev. T. A. Preston prepared and the Society printed
 annual reports embodying the results obtained. Mr. Preston found it
 impossible to continue the work, and Mr. E. Mawley took it up and

prepared the report for 1889. He has, however, arrived at the same

 conclusion as the authorities already quoted, and his recommendation to
 reduce and simplify the observations has been accepted by the Council of

 the Royal Meteorological Society, which now desires to enlist as many
 observers as possible, all of whom are to work according to the form, of
 which copies are submitted for consideration.

      ' With this view the Council of the Royal Meteorological Society
 has endeavoured to obtain the assistance of the Corresponding Socie-
 ties on the British Association list, and it is with the same object that
 I have asked permission to bring these few words before this Con-

 ference.'
CORRESPONDING SOCIETIES.  51

      Mr. Gushing said that the British Association had reported on this
·subject at the Cambridge Meeting in 1845, and it was then abandoned
until the Royal Meteorological Society took it up. As Mr. Symons
had said, the list in 1874 comprised seventy-one plants, eight insects,
·and seventeen birds. In 1883 the Society published a new schedule,

which included seventy-nine plants, eleven insects, and twenty-one
birds. After some years the list was reduced to thirteen plants, five

insects, and five birds, and he asked why this reduction had been

sanctioned.

     Professor Lebour raised the question why, among the plants, two
species had been included which were among the most variable of British

species ?

     The Rev. E. P. Knubley, with reference to the list of birds, said that
the swallow had been included, but a large number of persons did not
know the difference between a swallow, a swift, and a martin. It
occurred to him that it would be better to insert the sand-m;irtin in its
place, because it was likely to arrive the first of the three. The nightin-

gale, also included in the list, for all practical purposes ceased in the

south of Yorkshire. The only places it had appeared so far north were
in the neighbourhood of Doncaster, Leeds, and Harrogate. It had oc-
curred at Scarborough once, and it might perhaps be heard near Harro-

gate every three or four years. He suggested whether for this bird it

would not be better to substitute the chifF-chaflr, the willow wren, or the
redstart, which arrive about the same time and are of the same class.
This remark applied also to the West of England, where the nightingale
is unknown, and he thought that it would be better to have a bird which
extended all over the country.

     Mr. Symons said that the nightingale was not included in the first
schedule, but there was a strong feeling that the list of British birds
would be incomplete without it, and it was therefore eventually inserted.

He saw no reason why it should not stand, because he understood that

the list represented only the minimum, and not the maximum, of species
which might be recorded.

     After some remarks by Sir Rawson Rawson and Mr. Corse Glen,
    Professor Hillhouse called attention to the list of plants. He said
there was a manifest objection to the free use of hedge plants, because
the body of the hedge was often so protective that there might be two
observers in close proximity watching the same species and yet quite
diiferent dates might be entered, because of the prevailing direction of
the wind at the season. In the next place, with regard to Cratoegus
oxyacantha, they would not unfrequently find those plants which grew
near or in the hedge flowering ten days before the normal period. He
knew of two plants which were two forms of this species which grew
side by side with interlacing branches, the periods of flowering differing
by from seven to fourteen days. These were growing at the back of
Trinity College, Cambridge. With respect to Bosa canina, he was not
sure which of the eighteen to fifty forms could be identified with this
name, but their flowering period extended over something like seven
weeks. The records for this plant would, therefore, be very conflicting.
Professor Hillhouse further suggested the advisability of omitting from
the schedule the words : ' If, unfortunately, the first flowering be missed

for a day or two, the observer is requested to give the estimated date of

first flowering and to place an asterisk against the entry.' He was of

                                                                                                                        B2

opinion that botanists would like to see this clause omitted, and thai; only-
actual observations should be recorded.

     Mr. Symons, in concluding the discussion, stated that he had brought
the matter forward on behalf of the Royal Meteorological Society, and
as a meteorologist rather than as a naturalist. At the same time, the
subject was one of equal importance to naturalists and meteorologists,

and he expressed his thanks to those who had given hints and made
remarks with the object of getting the observations made in the best
possible way. He expressed a hope that the Societies represented at the

 Conference would be induced to assist in carrying on the work.'

   --Temperature Variation in Lakes, Rivers, and Estuaries. Professor

Meldola read the following communication from Dr. H. R. Mill, the
 Secretary of the above Committee :

      'The Committee has to thank the following local Societies for their
assistance in obtaining observations, and to state that the work of Society
observers is, as a rule, more regular and more accurate than that of

isolated volunteers :

      ' Manchester Geological Society, Grantham Scientific Society, Roch-
 dale Literary and Scientific Society, Bristol Naturalists' Society, Cardiff
Naturalists' Society, Burton-on-Trent Natural History Society, Bast
Kent Natural History Society, Marlborough College Natural History
 Society, Northampton Natural History Society, Dumfries and Galloway-
Natural History Society.

      ' Several other Societies applied for information, and would have
taken part in the work had there been a suitable river or lake in their
neighbourhood.

      ' It is desirable that the Societies already engaged in observations
should continue to make them for another year with as much regularity
as possible. Those which have not already taken it up will not be urged
to do so, as a sufficiency of data for the purposes of the Committee is-

now in course of being secured.'

   --Meteorological Photography. Mr. Hopkinson reported that the forma-

tion of a Committee for this purpose had been sanctioned by the Com-
mittee of Section A, and the form had been forwarded to the Committee

of Recommendations.^

                                                    Section C.

     Professor Lebour stated that he had been asked to represent the
Committee of this Section and to bring under the notice of the Delegates
the following list of Committees recommended for appointment :

   --1. Erratic Blocks. The work of this Committee had been explained

at former Conferences, and the co-operation of those Corresponding-

--Societies which had not yet taken part in the observations was invited.
     2. The ' Geological Record.' The continuation of this work had been
recommended and a grant had been asked for to assist in carrying on its

publication.

   --3. Underground Waters. -The work of this Committee had also been .

several times brought before the Delegates, and the Secretary, Mr. De

Ranee, was present to give any further explanations.

  --4. Exploration of Oldburj/ Hill. The exploration of this ancient

earthwork, near Ightham, in Kent, had been recommended, with the

Aspecial object of examining the supposed ' rock-shelters.'  committee

had been formed for the purpose of carrying on excavations.

   --5. Geological Photography. This Committee, of which Mr. Jeffs was

secretary, and the work of which had been discussed at the last meeting,

had been recommended for reappointment with the addition of two

·names.
--A6. Northamptonshire Lias.
                              committee for collecting and registering

the fossils of this formation had been recommended for appointment, and

excavations had already been commenced.

  --7. Sea-coast Erosion. This Committee, the objects of which had been

explained to the Delegates on former occasions, and of which Mr. Topley

was Secretary, had been recommended for reappointment.
--A8. Registration of Type Specimens.
                                       recommendation had also been

sent in for the appointment of a committee for reporting on type speci-
mens in museums, an important subject, in which great assistance might

be rendered by the local Societies.

   --9. Earth -Tremors. This Committee, which had been referred to at

former Conferences, had been recommended for reappointment, with

Mr. Davison as Secretary. Professor Lebour explained that his occupa-

tions left him no leisure for acting any longer as Secretary to this Com-

mittee.
--A10. Exploration of Elbolton Gave.
                                      committee had been formed for

the excavation of this cave, which was near Skipton, and in which relics
of human occupation had already been found. Some of the local Societies

in Yorkshire might assist in the investigation.

  --11. Source of the River Aire. The object of the Committee appointed

for the purpose of investigating this subject was to ascertain, if possible,
by means of the coal-tar colouring matter, fluorescein, whether the water
which flows out of Mai ham Tarn and disappears down a ' water sink ' to

the south of the Tarn is the stream which emerges at Malham Cove or

Aire Head, or at both these places. The use of the dye for this purpose

had been suggested by Professor Meldola to Professor S. P. Thompson,

and the latter had brought the subject before Section C in the form of a

paper with the object of having a committee appointed for the purpose of

carrying out the experiments. It had been suggested that the method

might be found generally useful for investigating the course of under-

ground waters, as a very small trace of the dye produced an intense

green fluorescence, and had not the slightest injurious effect upon the

water.

Mr. C. B. De Ranee, who had also been requested to act as a represen-

tative of Section C, made some remarks with respect to the work of the
Underground Water Committee. The latter had been appointed in 1874
and had just presented their sixteenth report. The objects of the Com-

mittee were to inquire into the subject of underground water with a view

Ato supply from wells or springs.  form of inquiry had been prepared

in which questions were asked respecting the quality, quantity, and level

of the water. They were particularly anxious to secure records of the

water level extending over long periods of time ; they had reason
--54 REPORT 1891.

to' believe that many sets of observations of the level in welTs andl
springs had been made daily or weekly during past times, and the-

Committee thonght it highly important to secure these old records if

possible.

    The work of the Coast Erosion Committee, which was appointed in 1882,
had been carried on with important results, and much information had
been derived from a study of old charts to which the Committee had been
enabled to get access. The Committee on Erratic Blocks, of which Dr.
Crosskey, of Birmingham, was the Secretary, was appointed in 1871 with
the object of recording the exact positions of the more important boulders
and, if possible, of entering these positions on the Ordnance map. Copies
of these maps should be kept by the Societies taking part in the work, and
copies should also be "sent to the British Association Committee. It was-

important also to have a microscopical examination of sections of chips
from the boulders made by competent geologists, so that the probable
sources of the boulders might be ascertained. Another point in connec-
tion with thi? subject, in which the Corresponding Societies might exert

their local influence, was that the boulders where they occurred should
not be left to the mercy of the stone-breaker, but should be preserved.
This applied especially to public parks or gardens, where the local Socie-
ties might well use their influence with the Corporations to induce them
to have the boulders preserved and even placed in prominent positions,,
where they might be readily accessible and at the same time secure from

danger of demolition.

    With reference to the publication of the ' Geological Record,' Mr. De

Ranee had been requested by Mr. Topley to bring the subject prominently
before the Delegates. The woi'k was instituted, as was well known, by
Mr. Whitaker in 1874, and entailed a large amount of unremunerated
labour. The number of copies sold was insuSicient to meet the cost of
publication, notwithstanding the grant made by the British Association,
and unless more subscribers could be secured the publication would have
to cease. The ' Geological Record ' Committee took the opportunity of
appealing to the Delegates, and Mr. De Ranee on behalf of the Committee
asked them to make known the character and scope of the work in order

to increase the list of subscribers. Circulars for this purpose were dis-
tributed among the Delegates.

Professor Meldola made some remarks with reference to the proposed

method for investigating the source of the Aire, after which he stated

that he had been requested by Dr. Crosskey to render the thanks of the

Erratic Blocks Committee to the Corresponding Societies for the aid

which they had already given, and to express a hope that their assistance

would be continued. Dr. Crosskey had forwarded for inspection a copy

of a paper on the boulders of the Midland district, by Mr. F. "W. Martin,

F.G.S., read before and published by the Birmingham Philosophical

Society. This paper was accompanied by a map of the Midland District

on the scale of two miles to the inch, and was considered by the Erratic

Blocks Committee to be an example of the method of investigation which

would yield the best results in this inquiry. In this paper attention had

been paid to distribution of the erratics, tlieir grouping and various levels,

their mixture with or freedom from local blocks, as well as to the import-

ance of discriniinatiug between erratics distributed without regard to

local hills and those that are gathered together in the valleys at present
Aexisting.
            copy of the last report of the Committee will be forwarded!
COREESPONDINa SOCIETIES.  55

on application to any address sent to Dr. Crosskey, and a few copies

of the map are also to be had by those Societies taking part in the

work.

    Mr. J. W. Davis stated, with respect to the work of the Committee

for investigating the source of the Aire, that some five or six years ago
Mr. Walter Morrison, M.P., and several members of the Yorkshire
Naturalists' Union, tried a number of experiments with aniline dyes,
similar to that proposed by Professor S. P. Thompson, but they had

all failed.

     Mr. Gray made some remarks with reference to the method of induc-
ing the Corresponding Societies to take up the work of the various
Committees. He thought that much force would be given to the represen-
tations made by the Delegates to their Societies if the Committees which
required the co-operation of the local Societies would send copies of their
reports to and communicate directly with those Societies, pointing out
that the work suggested by the Delegate was of real use and likely to be
valuable to the Committee in carrying out the objects of the British
Association. The Belfast Naturalists' Field Club, for example, had no
Committees on Erratic Blocks or on Coast Erosion, but if these Association
Committees sent their reports and a request for assistance he felt sure
that many members of their Society would be glad to take these

matters up.

    The Chairman, Mr. De Ranee, Mr. Hopkinson, and Mr. Corse Glen

spoke in favour of Mr. Gray's suggestion.

                                                  Section D.

    Professor Hillhouse stated that no new committees had been appointed
this year by their Section which had any bearing on the work of the

Corresponding Societies.

                                                     Section E.

  --Teaching of Geography in Frimary Schools. Mr. Sowerbutts said that

the Committee of this Section had had under consideration the teaching

of geography in primary schools. He had undertaken to draw up a

report on this subject with reference to the action of the local authorities,

and especially so far as concerned his own district in Lancashire. The
object of the report would be to make known how far the Government
grant apportioned for technical education or allied purposes was made
use of for the teaching of geography. His own experience went to show
that the subject was much neglected, and he invited Delegates from other
parts of the country to give information by sending in School Board

reports or reports of municipal authorities dealing with educational
matters, so that he might be able to present a fairly complete report to

the Committee next year. He hoped by this means that pressure might

be brought to bear upon the Government in order to have justice done
to a subject of such importance.

phical Society, vol. vii., Part 1., 1890. Dr. Crosskey 's address is 117 Gough Eoad,

                                                Section H.

   --Committee of Aid for Anthropological Excavations. Dr. Garson called

attention to the existence of a Committee of Aid formed by the Anthro-
pological Institute, and the purpose of which had been explained at last

year's Conference of Delegates. He stated that every year there were
many people who were desirous of carrying on, and who did sometimes

carry on, investigations of this kind, but unfortunately discretion was not
sufficiently mingled with the zeal displayed. This was, no doubt, due to
an imperfect knowledge of the method of conducting such investigations.
Owing to this want of knowledge a large amount of valuable material was
often destroyed. Tor the purpose of aiding by direction or otherwise the
exploration of ancient remains, a committee had been appointed in 1888
by the Anthropological Institute, the chairman of this committee being
General Pitt-Rivers, the Inspector of Ancient Monuments. Local Societies
would find it to their advantage if they would report to the committee ot
the Anthropological Institute when they were desirous of undertaking
explorations. Due attention would be given to their applications, and, if
thought desirable, the matter would be placed in the hands of some
expert member of the Committee, every member of the latter being in
some way a specialist; so that local exploring committees could have any
assistance they required in the way of skilled advice in opening up

barrows, earthworks, camps, &c.

    --PreJiistoric Bemains Oommittee. Mr. J. W. Davis said that this Com.

mittee, of which he was the Secretai-y, was appointed in 1887. Since
then four reports had been presented, which varied much in length, but

of which the interest and importance had been well kept up. He expressed

his conviction that if the various Corresponding Societies would take up
the work the subject would become of the very greatest importance to the

country generally. What was wanted was a record of everything that
Lad reference to prehistoric man, his dwellings, implements, pottery, &c.

A goodly number of reports had been promised, but it appeared that in

many instances their compilation took a considerable amount of time.
He hoped that next year they would present a much longer list than that
which had been presented to the Section this year. Dr. Munro bad pro-

mised a list of the lake dwellings of the British Isles ; and, amongst others,
Mr. Gray, who represented the Belfast Society, had promised to send a

one-inch map with the ancient remains in Ireland marked upon it. If
they could get a complete map of the whole country similarly marked,

this map, which would be the property of the British Association, would
be of the very highest value, and the Committee would have accomplished

most important work. He trusted the Delegates would inform their

Societies what had already been done and what still remained to be done,
so that they might be able to enlist the services of others who were

interested in Archaeological research.

     At the conclusion of the business a discussion took place with reference
to the best method for imparting to the Corresponding Societies through
the respective Delegates a knowledge of what had taken place at the
Conferences. Mr. Hopkinson suggested that each Delegate should read
a'paper before his Society, giving an account of the line of work taken
         CORRESPONDING SOCIETIES.       57

up by the various Committees, and that this paper should be published in

the Society's Transactions or Reports as soon as possible. He distributed
among the Delegates a paper of this kind which he had brought before

the Hertfordshire Natural History Society.^

    Another question raised was the advisability of in some way bringing

into relationship with the British Association those Societies which did
not come up to the standard of excellence for enrolment as Corresponding
Societies. It was stated that there were a large number of smaller
Societies doing good work, but which were not in a position to publish the
results of original investigations or to issue a publication. It was felt
that much good would be done to these Societies if they could be afi&liated
by some means, and allowed to take part in the meetings of the Con-
ference, perhaps without having the privilege of sending a Delegate to the
General Committee or of receiving gratuitously a copy of the annual
volume of Reports. The matter was referred to the Corresponding
Societies Committee for their consideration.

    On the motion of Professor Lebour, seconded by Mr. J. W. Davis, a

vote of thanks was passed to the Chairman, Mr. Symons, and to Professor

Meldola, the Secretary of the Conference.

V^ With reference to the last point raised at the Leeds Conference, the

Corresponding Societies Committee has to report that, after considering

the question referred to, it is recommended that the attendance at the

Conferences of representatives of local Societies which are not Corre-

sponding Societies should be sanctioned on the understanding that these

representatives are not actually enrolled among, and do not receive the

privileges of, authorised Delegates. The Committee has also authorised
its Secretary to supply any local Society which may apply for them

with copies of the reports of the Conferences, the lists of Committees, and

other information likely to be of use in furthering local scientific investi-

gation.

The Committee has received application from all the Societies now

enrolled, and recommends their retention. It is further recommended

to the General Committee that :    ..j

     1. The Somersetshire Archaeological and Natural History Society,
     2. The South London Microscopical and Natural History Society,
     3. The Tyneside Geographical Society,
    4. The Yorkshire Philosophical Society,

should be enrolled as Corresponding Societies of the British Association.

     ' This plan has been adopted in former years by the Delegates of the Manchester

Geographical Society, the Isle of Man Natural History Society, the Essex Field Club,
and the Yorkshire Naturalists' Union (Secretary Corresponding Societies Committee).

ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THEEMODTNAMICS.                            85

Report of a Committee, consisting of Messrs. J. Larmor aoid
     Gr. H. Bryan, 07i the present state of our knotdedge of Thermo-
     dynam,ics, specially with regard to the Second Laiv.

         [Ordered by the General Committee to be printed among the Reports.]

Paet I. Researches relating to the connection of the Second Law
         WITH Dynamical Principles. Drawn up by G. H. Bryan.

                        Introdiidion.

     1. The present report treats exclusively of the attempts that have

been made to deduce the Second Law of Thermodynamics from, purely

mechanical principles.

Before considering the several methods in detail it may be well to sum-

marise the meaning of the various terms which enter into the mathe-

matical expressions of the laws of thermodynamics, with a view of showing

more fully what conditions must be kept in view in establishing the

dynamical analogues. This has been done more or less fully by several

authors of papers on the subject, but more especially by von Helmholtz

in his paper on the ' Statics of Monocyclic Systems.' ' The substance of

this paper will be dealt with more fully later on in the present Eeport,
but we will now mention the principal points touched on in the introduc-

tion.

  --2. Meaning cf the Second Laiv. Let a quantity c?Q of work in the

form of heat be communicated to a body whose absolute temperature is 6.

dWLet E be the internal energy of the body,              the work done against

external forces by the change in the configuration of the body which

takes place during the addition of dQ. It is not assumed that the

external forces are conservative.

Then the First and Second Laws are expressed by the equations

                        dQ=d^ + dW                             (1)
                                                               (2)
                        dq=edS

where dS is a perfect differential of a quantity S, called the entropy, whose
value depends only on the state of the body at the instant considered.

    The essential principle involved in the Second Law does not lie solely
in the fact that dQ, has an integrating divisor 0. In fact, if we assume

that the state of a body is completely defined by tivo variables x and y, it
must always be jDOSsible to put dQ in the form

                        dQ='M.dx + 'Ndy,

Nwhere M, are functions of x and y only. And it is always possible to

find an integrating factor for an expression of this form.

     Moreover, if one integrating factor can be found for dQ, an infinite
number of such factors can be found. For in equation (2) let .s be any

arbitrary function of S ; then we may write the equation in the form

                                dQ=e'^ds.

                                                ds

                        ' Crelle, Jmirnal, vol. scviii.
86 KEPORT 1891.

Hence if   V=6^           (3)
we have               as  (4)

          dQ=r,ds

BO that 7j as well as 6 is the reciprocal of an integrating factor of clQ, or,

as we may call it, an ' integrating divisor ' of clQ,. Since dS/ds may be
regarded as a function of S, we see that the product of the temperature

into any arbitrary function of the entropy of a body is an integrating
divisor of (?Q, and therefore possesses properties analogous to 6 in equa-

tion (2).

     Hence the absolute temperature $ is not fully defined by equation (2),

and the Second Law of Thermodynamics is not, therefore, completely

proved by the establishment of an equation of this form.
     3. It is, therefore, necessary to take into account the other property by

which temperature is characterised, namely, that heat always tends to pass
from a body of higher to one of lower tem-perature, and in particular that
if two bodies in contact have the same temperature there ivill be no transfer-

ence of heat between them.

     The Second Law of Thermodynamics consists in the fact that among
the integrating factors of dQ there is one whose reciprocal, 6, possesses

the properties of temperature just mentioned.
      4. But, nevertheless, without considering the properties of thermal

--equilibrium between difierent bodies we derive one very important infer-

ence from equation (2) namely, that the thermal condition of a system
whose parts are in thermal equilibrium can be completely defined by a
single coordinate, or, in other words, that the consideration of thermal
phenomena only adds one to the total number of coordinates otherwise

required to fix the state of a dynamical system.

   --5. Impossibility of a Perfectly General Mechanical Proof. To reduce

the First Law of Thermodynamics to the principle of Conservation of
Energy it is only necessary to assume that heat is some form of energy

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

no hypothesis is required as to what particular form this energy takes.

It was natural, therefore, that physicists should at a very early date
endeavour to reduce the Second Law in like manner to a purely dynami-

 cal principle, and the jirinciple of Least Action naturally suggested itself

 as the pi'obable analogue of Carnot's principle. But here a limitation at

 once arises f.om the necessity of giving a dynamical meaning to dQ, the
 energy communicated to the system in the form of heat, and of separating

--dQ, fi'om dW, the energy communicated in the form of mechanical

 work.

      6. This limitation requires that some special assumption shall be made
 regarding the nature of heat, and the natural and almost inevitable
 assumption is that every finite portion of matter is built up of a very
 large number of elementary portions, called molecules, and that the form
 of energy known as Heat is due to the relative motion of the molecules
 among themselves.

      But, fui'ther, these molecules must be characterised by some peculiar
 property, such as their (practically) infinitely large number whereby
 their dynamical properties differ in some manner from those of a finite
 number of particles or rigid bodies. For without such a distinction it
 would be impossible to deduce any dynamical equations involving dQ,
           ON OUR KNOWLliDGK OV THERMODYNAMICS.                                                     87

the work performed on the system through the coordinates defining the

positions of the molecules and not involving --dW, the work performed

through the coordinates determining the external configuration of the

system. The two portions of the work could only enter together into the

equations in the form fZE.

    In other words, it is impossible to deduce the Second Law of Thermo-

dynamics from purely mechanical principles without making some

axiomatic assumption regarding the nature of the molecules whose motion

produces the phenomenon of heat.

7. The question now arises as to what dynamical quantity represents

Wetemperature.       have good reasons for believing that, in gases at least,

the absolute temperature is proportional, either to the total mean kinetic

energy, or to the mean kinetic energy of translation of the molecules.

But if this or indeed any other hypothesis be adopted it will be necessary,

before the mechanical theory of heat is complete, to prove that (1) the

molecular  kinetic   energy  is  an  integrating  divisor  of clQ,                             (2)  it deter-
                                                                                            ;

mines the thermal state of a body in relation to other bodies.

     Most of the earlier writings are concerned only with the first property.

But a complete mechanical proof of the Second Law would involve a

mechanical definition of temperature applicable to all kinds and states

of matter, together with an explanation on dynamical or statistical laws

of the principle of degradation of energy in non-reversible processes; and

we are still far from arriving at a satisfactory solution of either of these

problems.

8. It will be convenient to classify the methods by which the problem

has been attacked as follows, under three headings corresponding to the

three different fundamental hypotheses which underlie them :

I. The Hypothesis of ' Stationary ' or ' Quasi-Periodic ' Motions as

adopted by Clausius and Szily.

II. The Hypothesis of ' Monocyclic Systems ' of von Helmholtz, and

similar hypotheses.

III. The Statistical Hypothesis of Boltzmann, Clerk Maxwell, and

other writers on the Kinetic Theory of Gases.

    9. Rankine seems to have been the first who attempted to deduce the
Second Law from dynamical principles. As early as 1855 he published
a paper ' On the Hypothesis of Molecular Vortices,' ' in which he obtained

·equations analogous to those of thermodynamics; and in a paper read at

the British Association in 1865 - he explained the Second Law on the

hypothesis that ' heat consists in any kind of steady molecular motion

within limited space.' such as that due to circulating streams. Both of

Rankine's hypotheses are special cases of Helmholtz's ' Monocyclic

Systems.'

Boltzmann seems to have been the next to take up the subject, but his

·claim to priority has been disputed by Clausius, whose investigations

appeared about five years later. Boltzmann was undoubtedly the first to

regard the subject from a statistical point of view.

     Szily laid claim to the discovery of the connection of the Second

Law with Hamilton's Principle of Least Action, and he may fairly be

entitled to the credit of having propounded this connection. But most

of his early investigations are not only wanting in rigour, but in many

oases so inaccurate that they do not prove the connection at all.

' Phil. Mac/. 1855, pp. 354, 411.                 " Ibid. 1865, p. 241.
88 REPORT-- 1891.

     Clerk Maxwell's theorem, named after its discoverer, was tlie first
attempt at a kinetic analogue of thermic equilibrium. It was generalised
by Boltzmann, and afterwards further generalised by Maxwell himself
but the latter extensions are probably incorrect, as we shall see here-

after.

     Having thus briefly mentioned the earliest researches on the present
subject, let us turn to a consideration of the papers themselves, beginning
with the writings of Clausius and Szily.

Section I. The Hypothesis of Stationary or Quasi-Feriodic Motions.

  --10. Clausius and Szily. In 1870 Clausius showed that when a sys-

tem of particles is in stationary motion, the mean vis viva of the system

is equal to its virial.' About a year later he gave a proof of the Second

Law, based on the laws of motion, in a paper entitled ' On the Second
Axiom in the Mechanical Theory of Heat.' - The methods of proof

employed by Clausius in this paper are very laborious and complicated,

while his arguments are artificial and, in places, not very intelligible.
     Soon after Clausius' paper had appeared, Szily endeavoured to show

that ' what in the mechanical theory of heat is called the Second Law is

nothing other than Hamilton's Principle of Least Action.' ' The proofs

which Szily gave are, in many places, quite at variance, not only with
the principles of dynamics, but also even with the laws of Thermo-

dynamics themselves. Thus he repeatedly mistook f?E for cZQ, and tried

to show that fZE/T is a complete difierential (a result not in general

true) ; moreover, in endeavouring to account for the principle of degra-
dation of energy in a non-reversible cycle, he altogether ignored the First

Law, and supposed some of the molecular energy of the system to be

actually lost or annihilated by friction, viscosity, or imperfect elasticity

of the molecules, or by other similar resistances. In consequence he had

to employ methods of proof that were far from rigorous, and even, in

many instances, illogical.

  --Szily's papers seem, however, to have had one good eSect namely,

that of stimulating Clausius to remodel his investigations in a simpler

and more intelligible form. Those who care to examine the original

papers of these writers will find them translated in the volumes of the

' Philosophical Magazine ' from 1871 to about 1876. Among them is a
paper by Szily,^ in which he claimed to have deduced the Second Law

from the First ' without any further hypothesis whatever.' Yet Szily

based this investigation on two hypotheses which are hardly more

axiomatic than Carnot's principle.

  --11. Clausius' Methods. It would be useless to enter into further criti-
Wecism.
              now proceed to give a proof of the Second Law based on

the methods of Clausius, with the object of bringing into prominence the
more salient features of his investigations, and of presenting them in a

concise form.

The assumptions which form the basis of Clausius' proof may be stated

as follows :

(i.) In the steady or undisturbed state of the system the motion of

the molecules shall be stationary or quasi-jjeriodic ; in other words, the
potential and kinetic energies of the molecules shall fluctuate rapidly

about their mean values, and there shall be one or more ' quasi-periods,'
i, satisfying the definition which will be given in the course of the proof

(equation 13, infra).

    (ii.) When the state of the system is changed (as by the communica-

tion of heat or by changes in the volume or external configuration of a
body), such changes shall be capable of being treated as small variations
of the motion from the state of steady motion.

     Helmholtz, in his paper on Monocyclic Systems, makes a similar as-

--sumption namely, that the changes in the state of the system shall take

place so very slowly that the motion of the system at any instant differs
infinitesimally little from a possible state of steady motion. Tliis is the

--exact equivalent of the assumption always made in treating the Second

Law from a physical point of view namely, that heat is communicated

to or taken from the working substance so slowly that at every instant
of the process the temperature of the body is sensibly uniform through-

out.

     12. With these assumptions, let the positions of the molecules be
determined in the first instance by the Cartesian coordinates (*, y, z) of
the particles (iii) forming them.

     Suppose that the state of the system also depends on the values of
certain other coordinates, p^, p.2, &c., which, as suggested by J. J. Thom-

son,' we shall call the 'controllable coordinates' of the system; to this
class belong the volume of the body, the charge of electricity present
on it, or any coordinates which can be acted on directly from without.
The values of these latter coordinates will enter into the expression for

the potential energy of the system.

    Let T=kinetic energy of sjstem=^^^in{x'^ + y- 4- P)

                   V=potential energy.

                 E=total energy=T-FV.

shown that

     Here the terms

represent the woi-k done on the system by variation of the controllable
coordinates i.e., the external work performed on the system. Hence, if

8W denote the external ivorlc performed by the system, as in § 2, we have

                     ^l^Bp=-8W                              (8)

Substituting in equation (5) from (6), (7), (8), in succession, we have

     8\l'2T:dt=[^m(x8x + ySy + iSz)T+(\8T + SY + 8W)dt . (9)

But if 8Q represents the variation of energy communicated through the
molecular or uncontrollahle coordinates, we have, by the Principle of Con-
servation of Energy' (equation 1),

                        8Q=SE + SW = ST + 8Y + SW.

Therefore (9) gives

when written in the form

vided that the absolute temperature of a body is proportional to the mean

kinetic energy of its molecules taken over a quasi-period of their motion.
But to complete the proof it would still be necessary to show that a

quantity proportional to the mean kinetic energy of the molecules fulfils
the properties of temperature stated in § 3. The investigations on this

point will be considered in Section III.

     The hypothesis that the quasi-period i is very short compared with,
the time required to communicate a finite quantity of energy through the

molecules is tacitly involved in our regarding 8Q as a small variation.
On this hypothesis the value of T will vary very slowly, and T may
therefore be regarded as a continuously varying function. Hence, in
considering what takes place over a considerable number of quasi-periods,
we may replace the sign of summation by that of integration, and thus

obtain

                     J;t"^t~ °^,T,

the suffixes 1, 2 referring to the initial and final state of the body.
     14. The hypotheses involved in the definition of the quasi-period i by

means of equation (13) call for some comment. In his paper ' On a New

Mechanical Theorem relating to Stationary Motions,' ' CJausius gives a
rather more general form of the theorem, in which he supposes that there
may be different quantities i corresponding to different molecular co-
ordinates but in this case it seems to be necessary, according to him,

                                                   ;

that in the varied motion all the i's shall be altered in the same ratio. If
such is assumed to be the case, S log i will be the same for all. Hence
we shall obtain for the portion whose quasi-period is i

                                 8Q=2T8 1ogi-|-28T,

and, therefore, for the whole body

                            28Q=22T . S log i-|-282T
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

or, if we remove the signs of summation and let the quantities refer to

the entire system,

                                     8Q=2T81ogi + 28T,

whence

                      ^^=28(logiT)               (14)

as before.

If we assume that each molecular coordinate {x, for example) always

fluctuates in the same periodic time i, so that the corresponding velocity

X vanishes at the times i,, ^j+i, <i+2i, &c., then the relation defining

the corresponding t,

                      r -]'='>+'

                      mxhx        =0,

will be satisfied identically, and there will be no difficulty about the
matter. When, however, the molecular motions do not possess even this
amount of periodicity, Clausius gets over the difficulty by arguments of

--the following general nature : If we are dealing with a body of finite

                                      ' Phil. Mag. vol. xlvi. (1873), p. 236.

dimensions, the molecalar coordinates (.r, y, z) mnst fluctuate between
certain finite limits, and hence 8a;, 8y, Sz, cannot increase indefinitely with
the time. Hence by taking the time i sufficiently large we must have

ultimately

   £..} -- (i^>
                       ^=«1 ·

since the numerator does not increase indefinitely with i.

    Now, it appears to me that the statements printed in italics are open
to objection. There is no reason why 8,v, 8y, Sz should not increase con-

tinually with the time until they can no longer be regarded as small'
variations, and it seems highly probable that this ivill happen under
certain circumstances. Take, for example, the case of a gas formed of a
number of hard spherical molecules colliding with one another, the
lengths of the mean free paths being great compared with the radius of
each sphere. If the direction of motion of one of these spheres be varied
very slightly, then at the next impact there will be a considerable altera-
tion in the direction of the line of centres.* After the impact, therefore,
the variation in the direction of motion will be very greatly increased,
and a similar increase will take place at each impact, until at last the
molecule will no longer collide with the same molecules as in the original

motion, but will come into collision with quite a different set. By this

time there will not be the slightest connection between the original and
the varied motion.

     15. I would therefore suggest that the existence of a ' quasi-period '
i, as defined by (13), can be better explained by arguments of a statistical
nature based on the immensely large number of the molecules present in
a body of finite dimensions. In the steady or stationary motion of such
a body, it is reasonable to assume (as in the kinetic theory of gases) that
the velocities of the molecules are on the whole equably distributed as
regards direction. Thus, for example, the average number of molecules
for which x is positive and lies between ?t and u-^du is equal to the

average number for which x is negative and lies between --u and

-- +{u dii)

      Moreover, in the disturbed motion the displacements (Ss, hj, 82) of
any molecule cannot depend in any manner on its velocity components
(x, y, z). It is of course quite possible to conceive a disturbance of the
motion in which some fixed relation exists between the displacements and

--the velocity components of the molecules indeed, we might choose the
--relation to be any we please but a disturbance of this kind would only

be possible if the molecules were individually controllable ; in other words,
the displacements could only be brought about by means of Clerk Max-
well's ' demons,' and it would then be reasonable to suppose that the

Second Law would fail altogether.

     Hence in any physically possible variation of the motion the terms
involving positive and negative velocity components in the expression

                             +'^miiSx yhj H- z8z)

will on the whole cancel one another, and therefore the average value of
the expression will be zero. This proves Clausius' Theorem.

                        ' This is easily exemplified by means of billiard-balls.
ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THEBMODTNAMICS.  93

      It should be noted tbat Clausius introduces the conception of a
* phase ' in dealing with stationary motions, but this is not an essential
feature of the proof, and it only modifies the form of the equations. I
have therefore dispensed with it.

   --16. Connection with Hamilton's Principle. Although Thomson and

Tait have based their proof of the Principle of Least Action on equa-
tion (5), the above investigations do not show more than a very indirect
connection between that principle and the equation (14) which corre-

sponds to the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Had we used general-

ised coordiuates to represent the positions of the molecules, equation (6)
would have been replaced by Lagrange's generalised equations of motion,
and the connection would hardly have been any closer, depending only,
as it would have done, on the fact that Lagrange's equations could be de-
duced from the Principle of Least Action, and that equation (14) would
have been deduced from Lagrange's equations.

      Clausius recognised at the very outset of his researches the fact that

Hamilton's principle could not be applied directly to the case of a
system of molecules in which the variation of the motion was accom-

panied by the performance of external work through the controllable
coordinates of the system. For, as he puts it, Hamilton's principle only
holds good when, in the varied motion, the Ergal has the same form as a
function of the coordinates as in the original motion.' By the co-
ordinates Clausius here means the molecular coordinates only, for he
considers the controllable coordinates as variable parameters which enter
into and affect the form of the potential energy or ' Ergal.' In consequence
of this fact Clausius claimed that his equations involved a new principle

Wewhich was of more general application than Hamilton's principle.

shall, however, show (i.) that, by means of a certain assumption as to
the form taken by the external work, a system can be formed to which

Hamilton's principle is directly applicable (ii.) that the principle leads
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

immediately to the analogue of the Second Law in the form of equation
(14) ; and (iii.) that the assumption made does not really interfere with

the generality of the proof.

     17. Our assumption is that the external forces, acting on the control-

lable coordinates of the body, belong to a conservative system. This

system we may, for convenience, call the ' external system.' When the

body performs external work 8W, the potential energy of the external
system increases by 8W. Hence we may denote this potential energy by
W. The external system and the original body, when taken together,
form a complete dynamical system, to which Hamilton's principle can be
applied ; for the potential energy of the complete system is a function

only of the generalised coordinates of the system.

     Moreover, in the complete system the increment of the total energy is

=SE + 8W=8Q by (1). Hence the total energy may be denoted by Q

where

                            Q=E-|-W=T-fY + W,

Uthe total potential energy being where

                         U=V + W=Q-T.

     Let P\, Pi . . . denote the generalised coordinates of the complete
system, q^, q2 . . the corresponding velocities, so that <7,,=p,, ; and let

                                  » Fhil. Mag. vol. xliv. (1872), p. 365.

«i, s^, .... he tlie corresponding generalised momenta. Let p^ be taken
as a type of the controllable coordinates which define the configuration of
the external system, ^j^ as a type of the uncontrollable coordinates which
define the positions of the molecules in the body. Since the energy of the
external system is assumed to be wholly potential,

              .: s,,=^ =0                (16)

                                  O'la

    With the present notation the two general forms of the equation

expressing Hamilton's principle are

              Sr(T-U)tZ^=r2s8pT-Q8t . . . (17a)

and

              sr2T(^^=r^s8p r+*sQ        . . . (in)

Of these the latter form must be used. Assume i to be so chosen as to

satisfy the relation

which, since s,,=0, may also be written  .... (18)

                            [SVpJ=0;

a relation identical with that assumed in equation (13) and justifiable in
a similar manner.

    Equation (17b} now becomes, on introducing mean values,

                                                    8(2iT)=t-8Q,

giving, as before, equation (14),

                             8Q _

                                        -^=S2log(iT).

It might at first sight appear as if the assumption as to the conserva-

tive nature of the external forces imposed a serious limitation on the

generality of the theorem, and, in fact, prevented its application to cyclical

processes. But this is really not the case. To remove the limitation it is

only necessary to suppose that the external system contains certain connec-

tions by which periodic motion of the body is converted into progressive

motion of some of the external coordinates, as exemplified in the crank

Wof a steam-engine. In other words, the external energy must be a

multiple valued function of the controllable coordinates of the body.

From equation (18), i depends only on_the state of the bodv, not on that

of the external system, and evidently T depends only on the state of the

body. Hence, if the initial and final states of the body be the same,

although the initial and final states of the external system may be different,

we must have  .....f|=0

                                         (19)
            ON OCR KNOWLEDGE OF THERMODYNAMICS.                      95

    Since the external system of conservative forces may be chosen to be
any we please, equation (19) mast be true for any cyclical process what-

ever, whether or not accompanied by the production or absorption of
external work.

     This, then, is the closest connection which exists between Hamilton's

principle and the kinetic analogue of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

     VV"e might avoid the necessity of constructing a different multiply
connected field of external force to suit each cyclic process by adopting a

generalisation of the principle of Least Action, but this generalisation

would no longer belong to the forms given by Hamilton. Thus we might
suppose W, and therefore Q, to be a function of the time. This would
not affect the form of (17a), but in (176) iBQ, would be replaced by

   SQdt--i.e., iSQ.

   A slightly different method adopted by Helmholtz in his papers on

He' Least Action ' (Crelle, 'Journal,' vol. c.) leads to the same result.

supposed the generalised external force components P^ to be functions of

the time only; in this case we must write 2(PaPn) instead of W, and,
therefore, B + 2(P,,F,,)=Q.

     18. Under the present section of this Report must be mentioned
Prof. J. J. Thomson's theorem that 'when a system consisting of a very
great number of molecules is in a steady state, the mean value of the
Lagrangian function has a stationary value so long as the velocities of

the controllable coordinates are not altered.' '

     This ' theorem ' is nothing more or less than Hamilton's Principle of
Least Action, which is enunciated in a form identical with the above
by von Helmholtz in his paper on Least Action.^ In fact, if in equation
(18) we write

                                H=U-T,

and assume the variation to be so chosen that
                 ....8;=0, [2s,Sp,]^=0

we have at once

     The function H, which is merely the Lagrangian function with its
sign changed, has been termed by Helmholtz the Kinetic Potential.

    The mean value of this function is the dynamical analogue of the

quantity in the theory of heat which is called the Thermodijnamical Poten-

tial by Duhem and Massieu, the Force Function of Constant Temperature by

J. Willard Gibbs, and the Free Energy by Helmholtz himself.

only, the tliermodynamic potential is a minimum, is thus identical with
the principle of minimum action. For non-reversible processes the
thermodynamic potential tends to a minimum, and this fact expresses the
principle of degradation of energy involved in the Second Law, though as
yet the corresponding dynamical property has not been worked out.

     J. J. Thomson's applications of his ' theorem ' have no bearing on the
subject of this Report, as they do not depend to any extent on the
dynamical aspect of the question.

   Section II. Hypotheses based on the Properties of Monocyclic Systejas.

     19. The peculiarity of the theories to be discussed in this section is
that they are not in themselves statistical. They do not therefore postu-
late the existence of an infinitely large number of molecules the motion
of which, taken individually, is uncontrollable. Instead of this, the funda-
mental hypotheses on which they are based have reference to the forms
of the kinetic and potential energy as functions of the coordinates of the
system. Thus the equations of motion of any finite system of rigid bodies
fulfilling the necessary qualifications will give rise to equations analogous
in form to those which represent the laws of Thermodynamics.

     Under the present category may be classed Rankine's very early

theories, already mentioned, Helmholtz's papers on the statics of Monocyclic

Systems,^ and the proof of the Second Law given by J. J. Thomson in

his ' Applications of Dynamics to Physics and Chemistiy.' Boltzmann has
endeavoured to show how a system satisfying the properties of a mono-
cyclic system may be derived from statistical considerations, but this
investigation naturally falls under Section III. of this Report.

     Rankine's hypotheses call for no comment, being only very special
cases of those of Helmholtz.

   --20. H. L. F. von Helmholtz on the Principles of Statics of Monocyclic

Systems. As no account of these papers has hitherto been given in Eng-
lish, we shall now consider them somewhat fully. The introductory por-

tion has already been noticed in §§ 2, 3.
     Helmholtz defines a polycyclic system as a dynamical system containing

one or more periodic or circulating motions. If there is only one such
motion, or if, owing to the existence of certain relations between the
velocities of the diflFerent parts of the system, the circulating motions can
all be defined by a single coordinate, the system is called monocyclic.

   --As in other investigations the coordinates of the system fall under

two classes those which, following the suggestion of J. J. Thomson,
we have called ' controUahle ' coordinates, and those defining the in-
ternal or circulating motions within the system, which that writer calls
' unconstrainahle ' coordinates. In applying the results to Thermody-
namics, the latter coordinates are those which fix the positions of the
molecules, and thus define the thermal state of the body; they may,
therefore, be called ' molecular ' coordinates.

    A polycyclic or monocyclic system is assumed to possess the following

properties :

     (i.) The kinetic and potential energies of the system do not involve
the actual values of the molecular coordinates which define the circulating
motions, but only depend on their generalised velocities or rates ol

These coordinates are therefore r/i/rosfatic or, as J. J. Thomson calls

them, ' speed ' coordinates. The present hypothesis seems to assume that

the molecules exert no mutual forces except those due to impact or un-

yielding constraints. At any rate, if there be any other molecular forces

they can only depend on the controllable coordinates of the system.

    (ii.) When the state of the system is changed the changes take place

very slowly, so that the velocities of the controllable coordinates are small,

and so also are the acceleratious of the molecular or gj-rostatic coordiuates.

(This corresponds to the second assumption in § 11 )

     Also, if the Lagrangian function has not been modified, or if, in other

words, no gyrostatic coordinates have been ignored, T is a homogeneous

quadratic function of the quantities q,^, and hence in this case

    22. The simplest form of monocyclic syatem is that containing only

one gyrostatic coordinate 5,, ; here

             dq=q,ds,                                                                                                                                                                                                                              (25)

so that clQ, is the analogue of the quantity of heat communicated to a

body.

   Hence equation ('27) is analogous to the Second Law of Thermodynamics
as given by equation (2), on the assumption that the kinetic energy T takes

the place of the temperature.

     If S is the quantity corresponding to entropy in (27), we have on

integration

             AS=2(log S(,-- log A), where is a constant.

This may also be put in the form     .... (29)

Here s,,/qi, is of no dimensions in time ; hence Si,lqi, is a function of length
only, and the expression for S is exactly analogous to the corresponding

formula for a perfect gas

--dimensions of the quantities in (29), (30), we must have (c^j Cj,)/c^=§,

.·. c^,^=^Ci,, and this is the relation between the specific heats of a mon-

atomic gas.

23. Helmholtz next considers the more general case in which there

are several velocity coordinates q^,, and he investigates the relations con-

necting them on the assumption that dQ has an integrating divisor.

Writing            ....dQ='^qi,dsi^=\d(T

                                                          (81)

it is evident that the required conditions will be satisfied by assuming

that the equation

                   dq=0                                   (.32)

has an integral of the form                               (33)

           ....F(s^)=o-=constant

and that

     The conditions that the kinetic energy should be an integrating divi-
sor are also found. If the Lagrangian function has not been modified,
Helmholtz finds that the kinetic energy is in every case an integrating
divisor of dQ, provided that the geometrical relations between the motions
of the various coordinates are purely kinematical, or such as could exist

in nature.
     24. It has, however, been pointed out by Boltzmann, in his remarks on

Helmholtz's paper,i that Helmholtz's proof of this theorem is based on

     1 Boltzuiann, 'Ueberclie Eigenscliaften monocyclischer Systeme,' Crelle, Journal,
xcviii. p. 86 ct seq.
ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THERMODYNAMICS.                                      99

the assumption that dQ, has an integrating divisor ; or, in other words,
that the solution of the equation

                                     dQ=0

can be expressed in the form of a single primitive. Under such circum-
stances, the proof shows that the kinetic energy of the system must
necessarily be one of the integrating divisors of dQ. But, on the other
hand, there may be cases in which the equation cZQ.=0 does not possess
a solution in the form of a single primitive, and Helmholtz's investiga-
tions are not applicable to such cases.

     In fact the theory of differential equations shows that the equation

dQ='Sq,,ds^=0

does not in general lead to a single primitive of the form (33)
                                                  r(S(,)= constant.

In order to obtain an integral of (32) it is therefore in general necessary
to assume certain functional relations between the variables. In other

words, we must assume the existence of certain geometrical equations

connecting the different parts of the system, and this is equivalent to
imposing certain constraints whereby the number of degrees of freedom

of the system is reduced. Helmholtz finds that the kinetic energy T

will be an integrating divisor of dQ, provided that the assumed geometri-
cal equations are purely kinematical, and in this category are included all
forms of constraint which are possible in a perfectly conservative dyna-
mical system.

     There are, however, as Helmholtz has shown, certain cases in which
(32) has for its integral a single primitive of the form (33), and in these
cases it is not necessary to assume the existence of geometrical equations
representing constraints on the system. Such a polycyclic system possesses

properties identical with those of a monocyclic system, and, although the
gyrostatic coordinates are independent, the kinetic energy is always an
integrating divisor of dQ.

      It is probable that Helmholtz's geometrical equations can be interpreted
thermodynamically as the conditions that the different parts of the body

may be all at the same temperature. Unless this condition is satisfied we
know from purely physical considerations that dQ has not in general an

integrating divisor.

     25. The limitations, as well as the meaiaing of ' purely kinematical
geometrical conditions, are, however, more clearly shown in Helm-
holtz's second paper,' in which he deduces the analogue of the Second
Law by means of an application of the principle of similitude, as follows :
The geometrical conditions are considered purely kinematical when they
allow the rate at which the system is moving to be varied without vary-
ing the relations between the coordinates of tlie various parts. Thus
corresponding to any state of motion of the system we may obtain another
possible state of motion of the system by supposing all the velocities of
the system increased n fold, provided that proportional alterations be
made in the external forces (P) of the system. In the new motion the

     The effect of communicating a quantity of energy dQ, through the
speed coordinates of such a system will be to increase the rate of working

    26. By far the most interesting part of Helmholtz's papers is

ihat in which he has investigated the dynamical analogue of thermal
equilibrium between two or more bodies of equal temperature. Of this

portion we will now give a brief sketch.
     If two bodies of equal temperature are placed in contact, the state

of either body will be unafiected, and the system, taken as a whole, will
be subject to the two laws of thermodynamics.

     The dj'-namical analogue to be investigated is that of two monocyclic
systems coupled together by means of geometrical connections between
ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THERMODYNAMICS.  101

their molecular coordinates only (not between their controllable co-
ordinates) in such a manner that the motions of the two systems are
individually unaffected by the coupling, but that the coupled system

forms a single monocyclic system. Corresponding to equality of

temperature we must have equality between two integrating divisors of
(7Q for the two monocyclic sj'stems, and tliese integrating divisors must
always remain equal so long as the two systems are coupled together.

    Such being the conditions imposed upon the problem from thermal
considerations, Helmholtz investigates the general form of the integrating

·divisors for two monocyclic systems in order that this condition may be
fulfilled i.e., that equality of these divisors may bo the criterion of

the possibility of coupling the systems. This kind of coupling he calls
' isoniorous.' As simple instances of such coupled dynamical systems
the following are mentioned :

     (i.) Two revolving wheels may be coupled together by joining their

axles if their angular velocities are equal. If either wheel carries a
Watt's governor or centrifugal regulator in which the distance of the
revolving balls from the axis is controllable, the angular velocities of the

two wheels can thus be equalised just as two bodies may be brought to
the same temperature by applying suitable pressures.

     (ii.) Two circulating streams of liquid in annular vessels can be com-

bined into a single stream wherever their linear velocities are identical,

and the necessary conditions may be secured by suitably varying the

form and dimensions of the containing vessels.
     The principle of limited availability when heat is converted into

work by reversible processes depends on the impossibility of controlling
the individual molecules of a body : all that we can do is to commu-
nicate heat to the body by placing it in contact with another body, which
must be at the same temperature if the process is to be reversible. Cor-
responding to this property we must make the hypothesis that in a
monocyclic system it is impossible to operate directly on the gyrostatic
coordinates by means of external forces, but that work can only be
communicated through these coordinates by coupling the system with
another monocyclic system, and that the coupling must be ' isomorous.'
If this assumption be made, the monocyclic system will evidently possess

properties corresponding to the principle of limited availability.
     27. Let T/i and 172 be the required integrating divisors for tlie two

systems, so that whenever rji^r] and ^2='7 tlie systems can be coupled
together. Let the corresponding entropies be a-, and cto ; then for such a
coupled system we must have

therefore 77 is an integrating divisor of (?Q for the entire coupled system.

    Any other integrating divisor will be the product of t; with an arbi-

trary function of the corresponding entropy (§ 2). But the kinetic

energies Ti, T2, Ti+Tg are integrating divisors of cZQ,, r7Q,, and (?Q

     These, then, are the most general forms of 17,, tj., possessing the two

--qualifications by which temperature is characterised namely, (i.) Carnot's

principle and (ii.) the property of defining the state of a body in relation
to its thermal equilibrium with another body.

      28. There is still another condition to be satisfied in finding a kinetic

-- Aanalogue of temperature namely, the property that if two bodies, and

AB, are in thermal equilibrium, and if and C are also in thermal equi-
librium, then B and C will be in thermal equilibrium.

      This imposes on our monocyclic systems the condition that whenever
a system (1) can be coupled with either of two systems (2) and (3), the
systems (2) and (3) can also be coupled together. The examples already
given of wheels revolving with equal angular velocity and of circulating
 streams are instances of the fulfilment of this condition.

      In all such cases the ge(<metrical equations connecting the coordinates
of the coupled bodies must be of the form

                                               ^i='A2=X3 · · · · · (52)

second, and xs those of the third.

cliaractorise temperature as the criterion of tbermal equilibrium between

two or more bodies.
   It has also been deduced that </>! and ij/^ are integi-ating divisors for

the two respective systems, so that tliey satisfy the definition given by

--Carnot's laws.
     The only other property of heat namely, the principle of limited

--availability follows at once on the hj^pothesis of § 26 as to the uncon-

strainable nature of the gyrostatic coordinates of the system, and the

analogue is therefore complete.

    30. Helmholtz is almost the only writer who has made any attempt
at a complete mechanical theory of heat. The other writers have simply
endeavoured to show that an equation of the form (2) can be deduced

from dynamical considerations by assuming that the kinetic energy due

to the uncontrollable motion of the system takes the place of temperature.

--This assumption is not necessary in Helmholtz's investigations a great

advantage considering our uncertainty as to the nature of temperature.
     Although the properties of temperature are explained by means of

monocyclic systems, it cannot be said that they are ])roved. on these

hypotheses. Thus, it would be very easy to couple a monocyclic system
with two other systems in such a manner that the two latter could not

--also be coupled together as, for example, in the case of revolving wheels

connected together by cogs. What Helmholtz has done is to show the

possibility of dynamical analogues and the conditions they must satisfy,

rather than to establish an analogy between all dynamical systems and

heated bodies.

     The omission of the work done by intermolecular forces also intro-

duces certain restrictions on the generality of the proof. In the vortex

atom theory of matter no difficulty of any kind presents itself, because

the  vortex atoms  are  essentially monocyclic in  character                                             but on  Bosco-
                                                                                                      ;

vich's hypotheses there will be difficulties, although these difficulties do

not appear insuperable. There seems, for example, no reason why the

molecular potential energy should not be controllable, in which case the

work done by the intermolecular forces would be of the nature of

--available energy available, that is, through the controllable coordinates

of the body. Thus, for example, if we suppose a number of molecules
enclosed in an envelope at rest under their mutual repulsions, and if we

imagine the envelope to expand so that the distances between the mole-

cules are increased, the intermolecular forces do work in expanding the

envelope, and the whole of this work will be available. Thus there is

nothing impossible in such an hypothesis. But it cannot be regarded as

axiomatic, and can only be justified if it is found to accord with observed

phenomena, among which must be included the Second Law itself. In

fact, it must not be forgotten that the object of all such investigations is

to discover theories which will account for facts, and not to prove facts

by means of theories.

  --31. Professor J. J. Thomson's Proof of the Second Law. The investi-

gation now to be considered is one which in its principle and fundamental

hypotheses is intimately related to Helmholtz's researches, although the
method of proof is somewhat different. I refer to the proof of the Second

Law given by Prof. J. J. Thomson in his ' Applications of Dynamics to

Physics and Chemistry,' chap. vi. §§ 46-49. It is in connection with
this investigation that the author introduces the terms ttnconstrainahle
and controllahle, which he uses to distinguish coordinates defining the
ON OUIl KNOWLEDGE OF THERMODYNAMICS.       105

states of the molecules of a body individually from those which define the
state of the molecules in the aggregate.

     It was stated in § 24 that, under certain circumstances, a polycyclic
system may possess exactly the same properties as a monocyclic system,
even though the coordinates defining the circulating motions of the
system are all independent. The system considered by J. J. Thomson
belongs to this class, for the necessary conditions are secured by the
assumption which the author makes in the following statement concerning

--the kinetic energy due to the molecular or ' unconstrainable ' coordinates

«i of the system : ' If the term

^[(uti,)u-+ . . . }

involves any ' controllable ' coordinate then it is evident that this co-
                                                                                                                                                             <f),

ordinate must enter as a factor into all the terms in the form expressed
                                    <f>

by the equation

i{(«w)"'^+ . . . ]=yW{(uicyn^-+ . . . } .  . (60)

where the coefficients (iiuy do not involve ^, otherwise the phenomenon
would be influenced more by the motion of some particular molecule than
by that of others.'^ In other words, the investigation is limited in its

application to the thermal properties of a single body, for in the case of a

system of more than one body it is. evident that the phenomena would
be difi'erently influenced by the motion of the molecules in diff'erent
bodies. In such a case the molecular kinetic energy of each individual

body would contain a common factor f(<j>), which might be different for
difi'erent bodies. Even in the case of a single body the assumption,

thoiTgh plausible, can hardly be regarded as axiomatic.
     The other assumptions involved in J. J. Thomson's work are similar

to those of Helmholtz, but they impose fewer restrictions on the gene-
rality of the proof. While Helmholtz assumes that the changes in the

state of the system take place so slowly that the velocities of the con-

trollable coordinates (q,, or ^) do not enter into the energy of the system,

Thomson merely assumes that the portions of the kinetic energy due to

the controllable and molecular coordinates are distinct, so that the whole
kinetic energy is of the form

T=T, + T,,                                 (61)

where the part T,, alone is to be taken as the dynamical analogue of
temperature, the part T^^^ denoting the kinetic energy due to motions of
the body as a whole and other controllable motions.

     Moreover, Thomson only assumes that the potential energy of the
system is a function of the controllable and not of the molecular coordi-

nates, so that

    32. J. J. Thomson also mentions the case in which V, the potential

energy of the system, is a function of the molecular as well as of the
controllable coordinates. But here he tacitly assumes that the molecular

Vcoordinates only enter into in the form of the temperature, an assump-

tion quite unjustifiable from dynamical considerations, for no dynamical

meaning can be attached to temperature until the Second Law has been

completely (vide §§ 2, 3) established by dynamical principles.

    On the hypothesis that T,, is the quantity which is analogous to tem-

perature in the dynamical system, the assumption takes the form

       ^'Z''=tTf-                                      («8)

and unless this condition is satisfied the relation (66) will not be true, as
J. J. Thomson asserts, when the potential energy is a function of the
molecular as well as of the controllable coordinates.

     Concerning the physical aspect of equation (68) Mr. C. V. Burton has

--suggested to me the following argument : If we consider a vessel of

unalterable volume containing ice, water, and steam at tlie triple point
it is evident that heat may be communicated to the system isothermally,
the effect being to decrease the quantity of ice and to increase the quantity
of water and of steam without altering the pressure or volume. In this
case the molecular potential energy would in all probability be increased
without any concomitant change in the temperature or in the potential
energy of the controllable coordinates.

  --33. H. FoincarS on the Applicability of Monocyclic Systems to Irreversible

Processes. The question whether Helmholtz's monocyclic systems can
be employed to illustrate irreversible processes has been considered by
Mons. H. Poincare,' and answered by him in the negative ; but his inves-
tigation is far from satisfactory.

      In the first place, he points out that an irreversible process is only

' Comptes Rendus, cviii. (1889), p. 550.
          ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THERMODYNAMICS.  107

dynamically possible when the Lagrantrian function contains odd powers
of tha generalised velocities, and that this is the case when it has been
modified so that some of the velocities have been ignored owing to the
corresponding generalised momenta being constant. But this simply
means that the ignored velocities are not to be reversed when the motion
of the system is reversed. It is easy to see that in a dynamical
system it is not in general possible to reverse some of the motions

without reversing them all.
     Poincare now considers, as a test case, that in which the system is

acted on by no external forces, and he considers, more particularly, what
happens when the entropy is approaching its maximum, his object being
to discover whether there is any dynamical way of proving the funda-

mental thermodynamic property that the entropy of a system is con-

tinually increasing. If such is the case, then, taking S as the entropy,

dS/dt must always be positive. Now, taking E as the energy and adopt-

ing the notation of Helmholtz, the Hamiltonian equations give

          dp_dB         d.s_ _8E_
          di~ ds'
                        dt dp'

whence    dS ^fdSdE_dSdE\

          df-^\dp ds ds'dpj ' ' ' * ^ '

In the subsequent investigation Poincare assumes that when the entropy
is a maximum the system must he in stable equilibrium, so that in this
condition of the system we have not only

          -9S=o    and  fOS=0,
          dp

but also

          1^45=0 and ^=^=0.
                        dt ab
          dt dp

Such a step appears to me to be quite unjustifiable, for it amounts to

nothing less than assuming that the system under investigation is at the
absolute zero of temperature, and the entropy in such a case will of

course be infinite.

    If we have any number of bodies enclosed in an adiathermanous
envelope it is known from physical, not dynamical, considerations that

the entropy of the system will tend to a maximufii as the temperatures

of the various bodies become equalised, and yet when all the bodies are
at the same temperature the molecules are still in a lively state of motion,

not at rest, as in Poincare's investigation.

     It is also to be noted that Poincare nowhere makes use of the fact

that S is the entropy of the system.

    Hence it is difficult to see how Poincare's result can have any direct
bearing on the principle of degradation of energy or even how it can have

a thermodynamical interpretation at all.

     34. At the same time, there are many considerations which render it
prima facie unlikely that the monocyclic method should be capable of

accounting for the principle of degradation of energy.

    A system which is irreversible will certainly not be monocyclic

according to the definition of Helmholtz, and hence we cannot assume
108 RKPORT-- 1891.

that tbe geometrical equations which that author has investigated

will any longer hold good ; the same may also be said with regard to the

alternative hypothesis underlying J. J. Thomson's investigation. More-

over, even if the latter hypothesis be assumed to hold good for an

unequally heated body, the function which plays the part of tempera-

ture will be the whole molecular kinetic energy, so that instead of the

entropy we shall obtain an expi'ession which does not alter in value as

the temperatures of the various parts become equalised. Another

hypothesis, which does not seem to me to be unreasonable, is that

possibly irreversible changes may take place when any portion of the

potential energy of the system depends partly on the molecular as well

as on the controllable coordinates of the system, so that this portion of

potential energy, as well as the kinetic, is uncontrollable. But then

thei'e appear to be no grounds, except from statistical considerations, for

supposing that this enei'gy will all be rendered kinetic by the action of

the intermolecular forces. Such would certainly not be the case in a

system possessing only one or two degrees of freedom.

The consideration of dissipative forces, such as friction, is of course

precluded by the conditions of the problem, for their presence would be

a violation of the principle of Conservation of Energy. And as we are

thus left with a dynamical system which is pei'fectly reversible (provided

that the system is complete and all the velocities are reversed), it seems

necessary to accept the principle of degradation of energy as a statistical

Weproperty and not as a dynamical principle.     shall consider the matter

more fully in the third section of this Report.

  --35. Dr. Ludwig BoUzmann on the MecJianical Representation of Mono

cycles. In his paper on the properties of monocyclic systems, already

referred to,^ Dr. Boltzmann discussed at great length a mechanical model

illustrative of a system in which it appeared not only that dQ/T was not

a perfect diflerential, but that clQ did not possess any integrating factor

whatever.

In a volume only just published ^ Boltzmann has again taken up the

representation of monocyclic systems by means of mechanical models, and

has slightly elaborated ideas suggested in Helmholtz's papers. On

account of their greater simplicity we will consider the latter represen-

tations before the former.

As a simple example of a monocyclic system Boltzmann takes a

vertical revolving shaft having attached to it a horizontal spoke along

Awhich a bead can slide without friction.     string, which is attached to

the bead, passes over a small pulley close to the shaft, and hangs freely,

·can-ying a scale-pan, on which varying weights can be placed. The

Darrangement may be illusti-ated by the shaft C and the spoke carrying

the mass E in the figure of § 38.

If we suppose the shaft and spoke to be without mass, and mif be

the mass of the bead, r its distance from the shaft, w the angular velocity,

T the kinetic energy of the system, and clQ the amount of work performed

by turning a handle attached to the shaft, we have

                            '^^=dlog(r*u.^-)     ....  (70)

The right-hand side is equal to d log (s-), where 5 is the angular

momentum, thus agreeing with Helmholtz's result (§ 21, equation 27).
    Boltzmann shows how such a machine may be made to undergo a

series of transformations analogous to Carnot's cycle. In an isothermal

transformation the angular velocity and the distance of the bead from

the shaft are varied in such a manner that the kinetic energy of rotation

remains constant ; in an adiabatic transformation no work is performed

on the shaft, and thei-efoi'e the angular momentum, mr'-u), as also the

corresponding entropy, remains constant.

The author gives other models of monocyclesin which several movable

Arods and beads are attached to the same shaft.  Watt's governor is

another simple example of a monocycle. Other examples of 'kinetic

engines ' were given by Professor Osborne Reynolds in a lecture delivered

on November 15, 1883.'

    36. An attempt is also made by Boltzmann to extend the dynamical

analogy to irreversible processes, by showing that for a cycle of changes

which do not take place infinitely slowly we must have fclQ/T <0. Un-

fortunately, however, this generalisation does not hold good if the system

is frictiouless, and, as already remarked, the introduction of friction is

not allowable in forming a purely dynamic analogue of the pi'operties

of heat. Boltzmann assumes that ichen the head is sliding outwards along

the spoke, the tension in the string is always slightly less than the centrifugal

force, and that when the head is sliding inwards the tension is alivavs sliglithj

greater than the centrifugal force ; for otherwise (he says) the bead and

suspended weights would never start moving. Thus if p denote the ten-
sion in the string, we may put

         ^p --mrtji^ e,

where e always has the same sign as dr.
     But the statements in italics are not true if the spoke is frictiouless,

for the equation of motion of the bead is

so that

         --e=md^r

                      ,.

              dt-

If the bead be allowed to slide outwards, starting at distance r^ and
stopping at distance r^, then d'^r/dt^ must be at first positive and afterwards

negative, for otherwise the outward velocity dr/dt would continually
increase. Hence e cannot always bave the same sign as dr, and Boltz-
mann's argument fails.

    37. Boltzmann's mechanical representation of a system in whicb dQ

has no integrating divisor consists of two parallel revolving vertical
shafts, which we will call A, B, each similar to that described in § 35 and
figured in § 38, each provided with a horizontal revolving spoke, along
which a bead is capable of being made to slide. The motions of the
two shafts are connected together through the following mechanism .-

AThe motion of is transmitted by means of bevelled cog-wheels to a

horizontal shaft C, carrying at its other end a i-ough disc Gr, which of

Bcourse revolves in a vertical plane. Attached to the vertical shaft is a

                                                        ' JVature, vol. sxix. p. 113,

horizontal disc H, the edge of which is in contact with the /ace of the disc

G. The motion of the horizontal shaft is transmitted to the vertical

Bshaft by means of the friction at the point of contact of the two discs

HG, H. The disc is capable of being- raised or lowered on the shaft B,
Aand in this way the ratio of the angular velocities of the two shafts and

B can be varied. Lastly, the system is set in motion by turning a handle

attached to the shaft A.

     Let m, jn be the masses of the beads on the spokes attached to the

Bshafts A, ; let r, p be their distances from the axes, iv, u the angular

Hvelocities of the shafts, a the adjustable height of the horizontal disc
Habove the axis of the horizontal shaft C. Boltzmann assumes the disc

to be of unit radius, and the radii of the bevelled cog-wheels connecting

BA, C to be equal, so that the angular velocities of the shafts A, are

connected by the relation            =oj aio.

    If, with Boltzmann, we neglect the inertia of everything except the

sliding beads, and supposing that r, p, a only vary very slowly, the
kinetic energy is evidently

     T = + = +-^ (^mr^iv'^                              /ip-a"^) w^.

     The system has four generalised coordinates, namely, r, p, a, and the
angular coordinate corresponding to the angular velocity w. The latter

is the only speed coordinate of the system, for the kinetic energy does

not involve the rates of change of the other coordinates.

Hence if we follow Helmholtz's assumptions (i.), (ii.) of § 20, the

coordinates r, p, a must be regarded as controllable, and the system is

Wemonocyclic.      have, in fact,

and                =dq=^wds 'Ylcl (2 logs),

so that T is an integrating divisor of cZQ.

     This result is quite at variance with that found by Boltzmann. The

reason is that he has not regarded r, p, a as controllable, but has included

in dQ the woi'k brought into the system through these coordinates.

be a loss of energy through friction, as the edge of the horizontal disc

H would have to slip up or down in contact with the face of the vertical

Bdisc G. This slipping may be avoided by shifting the vertical shaft

slightly to one side or the other of the vertical plane through the

horizontal shaft C. The friction between the rotating discs will then

Hcause slowly to rise or fall (as the case may be) automatically and

without slipping.

     This simple device obviates a difficulty which in Boltzmann's original

paper requires several pages of explanation.

  --38. Simple Mechanical Model of Garnofs Beversihle Heat-Enr/ine. The

following model appears to be new. It may be of interest as furnishing

a mechanical representation of the properties of the source and

refrigerator of a perfect heat engine, although to do this it is necessary

to take the angular velocity instead of the kinetic energy to represent

temperature. In this respect the model resembles the example (i.) given

in § 27, and the angular momentum takes the place of entropy.

As in Boltzmann's models, I suppose the working substance repre-

sented by a hollow vertical revolving shaft C D, carrying a spoke on

which the mass E is free to slide. This shaft is terminated by circular

Ddiscs C, ; while the source and refrigerator of the engine are repre-

sented by discs A, B, made to revolve with constant but unequal angular

     39. The investigations now to be considered depend on the existence
of a certain law of average distribution of speed, which holds whenever
an enormously large number of molecules is in a state of steady or

stationary motion. This remark applies to the Kinetic Theory of Gases,
and the methods are only applicable when the nature of the molecules is

such that the law of distribution in question is capable of investigation.

    Among the more recent researches bearing on the subject may be
particularly mentioned Professor Tait's papers ' On the Foundations of

the Kinetic Theory of Gases,' ' Dr. Boltzmann's papers on the ' Analogies

of the Second Law ' '^ and on the ' Properties of Monocyclic and other

Belated Systems,' ^ and Sir William Thomson's recent communication to

the Boyal Society ' On some Test Cases for the Maxwell-Boltzmann Doc-

trine regarding Distribution of Energy.' *

   --40. The BoUzmann,-3Iaxivell Bodr-ine. The law of distribution of speed

is variously known as Boltzmann's Theorem and Clerk Maxwell's Theorem,
being due in part to one writer and in part to the other. It seems to
have been first discovered by Clerk Maxwell for the case of a number of
perfectly elastic smooth colliding spheres of two or more different
magnitudes, or, if preferred, a number of simple particles which repel
one another when at a certain distance apart, after the manner of
perfectly elastic spheres.^ The theorem was subsequently generalised
by Boltzmann ^ for the case of a system of pai'ticles repelling one another
according to any law, and was finally generalised still further by Max-
well ^ for a number of molecules, each consisting of a dynamical system

defined by means of any generalised coordinates whatever. The case
when the molecules are iu a field of l^rce due to external influence while
the only intermolecnlar forces are those due to impact is considered by
Dr. Watson in his ' Kinetic Theory of Gases.'

     Clerk Maxwell's theorem in its most general form states that when

a system of molecules has attained the ' special ' or stationary state the
time-average of the kinetic energy is equally distributed over the different
degrees of freedom of the system.

    It now remains to examine how far the successive generalisations
have since been proved or disproved ; accordingly we shall consider them

--in the following order :

       (i.) Colliding elastic spheres under no forces,
       (ii.) Colliding elastic spheres in a field of force,
     (iii.) Simple particles or smooth spheres under molecular forces,
      (iv.) Molecules of a perfectly general character.

     41. The fii'st case, that of colliding spheres under no forces, has
been considered by Tait in his important papers ' On the Foundations of
the Kinetic Theory of Gases.' ' Tait finds that the theorem does hold

--good provided that the following assumptions be made:

     (a) That the particles of the two gases are thoroughly mixed.
     (b) That the particles of each gas acquire the error-law of speed.
     (c) That there are free collisions between particles of the same
as well as of different kinds, and that one kind does not preponderate
overwhelmingly over the other.

42. The second case also ha-s been verified by Tait in the same con-

tribution. He considers the case in which the field of force is uniform,

Alike that due to gravity.  limitation is thus imposed on the generality

of the proof, for the investigation does not hold good when the external

force varies so rapidly from point to point that the change from molecule

to molecule is appreciable. On the contrary, it must be possible to

divide up the mass of gas into elements which are so small that the

force over any such element may be considered uniform, and never-

theless each element must contain such a large number of molecules that

the distribution of energy in it can be investigated by Tait's method.

This limitation is not assumed in the pi'oof given by Watson,'-^ but it

seems doubtful whether the theorem is valid except under some such

restriction. One of the ' test cases' considered by Sir William Thomson

in his recent paper ^ may possibly throw some light on this question
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

I refer to the case of a system of particles moving in two dimensions in a

    Thomson concludes that the portions of average kinetic energy due
to the two velocity components x and j/ are probably not in general equal
to one another. The author considers a system in which no collisions

distribution of energy between the two velocity components of the par-
ticles, and it seems reasonable to draw the following inferences regarding

the more general case :

(i.) If the molecules are very few and far between, impacts will

seldom occur, and the distribution will approximate to what it would be

if there were no impacts, as in the case considered by Thomson.

(ii.) If the molecules are densely distributed, impacts will be nume-

rous, so that the distribution of speed will depend mainly on these impacts,

and will approximate to that investigated by Tait for a uniform field.

(iii.) In intermediate cases the distribution of speed_ will be deter-

mined partly by the impacts and partly by the variations in the field. lb

-will, therefore, be intermediate between those investigated by the method

Aof Thomson and that of Tait.  complete investigation of such a case

--would probably be one of great difiBculty.
     43. The third case namely, that in which the intermolecular forces

--are other than those due to impacis presents a new feature of difficulty :

it now becomes necessary to take account of the possibility that three
or more particles may be simultaneously within mutual influence of one

another ; for the probability of this is no longer infinitely small, as it is in

the case of simple impacts.

     In his recent paper already alluded to, Thomson considers this point,

more especially with reference to a system composed of double molecules

Aor ' doublets.' ' compound gas is an example of such a system. Here a

complete collision may consist of a large number of impacts, and the
author reoiarks that ' it seems exceedingly difficult to find how to cal-

culate true statistics of these chattei'ing collisions and arrive at sound
conclusions as to the iiltimate distribution of enei'gy in any of the very

simplest cases other than Maxwell's original case of I860.'
      It seems, however, unnecessary to consider multiple collisions if either

of the following conditions is satisfied:
     (a) If the I'ange of molecular action lies between narrow limits, so

that the collision is approximately of the nature of a simple impact.

     (b) If the intermolecular force only acts when the particles are at a
considerable distance apart. The 'radius of encounter,' as it maybe
called, being thus very great, we may safely assume that the aggregate

effect on any molecule of such a system of distant molecules is constant,
and therefore equivalent to that of a field of external force. Unfor-

tunately, hoAvever, this case is of little interest.

   A --difficulty of a different kind has been indicated by Tait -

namely, that of giving a satisfactory answer to the question, ' What is to

be taken as the measure of the temperature ? ' According to the views

of Clausius, Van der Waals, and others, the whole average kinetic energy

per molecule measures the temperature ; but Tait gives reasons for be-

lieving that the temperature depends on the mean squai*e speed of the

free paths of the molecules, and is therefore measured by the value of
the average kinetic energy when (with the same mean square speed of

free path) the volume is infinite. In other words, Tait supposes the

temperature measured by the average kinetic energy per free molecule.

If the mean square speed be kept constant, the whole kinetic energy will

vary with the volume of the gas, and thus on the hypothesis of Clausius

Foundations of the Kinetic Theory of Qasep,' Froc. H.S.E. 1890.
ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THERMODYNAMICS.  115

 the temperature would vary instead of, as it should, remaining constant.

 Moreover, in the case of a liquid in contact with its vapour at the same
 temperature, the whole kinetic energy per molecule should be equal in
 the two portions, and this again appears improbable.

      44. The last and most general case of all is that investigated by
Maxwell in 1878,' where the molecules consist of dynamical systems
determined by means of generalised coordinates. It has now been
proved beyond doubt tliat the theorem is not valid in this general form.
As a test case, Burnside - has considered a system of collidino- elastic
spheres, in which the centre of mass does not coincide with the centre
of figure, but is at a small distance, c, from it. He finds that the average
energies of rotation of any sphere about each of the three principal axes
through the centre of inertia are equal, and that the whole averao-e

energy of rotation is twice the whole average energy of translation. Had

Maxwell's theorem been true, the whole average energies of rotation and
translation would have been equal.

     Maxwell's proof is defective in several respects. One of the chief
fallacies lies in his assumption that the kinetic energy of a dynamical
system can always be expressed as a sum of squares of generalised
velocity components. At the same time, he assumes that the Lao-rancrian

or Hamiltonian equations of motion can be applied to the correspondino-

generalised coordinates of the system. This is not in o-eneral true
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

thus, for example, it is not true in the simple case of a single rigid
body. Here the kinetic energy due to rotation can be expressed as

a sum of squares of the angular velocities about the three principal axes

but these angular velocities are not the rates of ch.ano-e of o-eueralised

coordinates which determine the position of the body at any instant.^
Thus the want of agreement between Maxwell's theorem and Barnside's
result is only what might have been expected.

     In the paper already referred to Thomson says, 'But, conceding
Maxwell's fundamental assumption, I do not see in the mathematical
workings of his paper any proof of his conclusion "that the average
kinetic energy corresponding to any one of the variables is the same for

every one of the variables of the system." Indeed, as a general pro-

position, its meaning is not explained, and seems to me inexplicable.
The reduction of the kinetic energy to a sum of squares leaves the

several parts of the whole with no correspondence to any defined or
definable set of independent variables. What, for example, can the
meaning of the conclusion be for the case of a jointed pendulum (a
system of two rigid bodies, one supported on a fixed horizontal axis, and
the other on a parallel axis fixed relatively to the first body, and both
acted on only by gravity) ? The conclusion is quite intelligible, however

(but is it true ?), when the kinetic energy is expressible as a sum of

squares of rates of change of single coordinates each multiplied by a
function of all, or of some, of the coordinates.' '

theorem on account of ' the supposition that the mean enero-y of any
kind of vibration in any atom must be equal to that of translation in any

direction, and therefore capable of unlimited increase.' ' According to
Thomson, however,^ ' what has hitherto by Maxwell, and CJausius, and
others after them, been called an "elastic sphere " is not an clastic solid
capable of rotation and of elastic deformation, and therefore capable of an
infinite number of modes of steady vibration, of finer and finer degrees of
nodal subdivision, and shorter and shorter periods, into which all trans-
lational energy would, if the Boltzmann-Maxwell generalised proposition
were true, be ultimately transformed. The smooth "elastic spheres"
are really Boscovich point-atoms with their translational inertia, and witb
for law of foi'ce zero force at every distance between two points exceeding
the sum of the radii of the two balls, and infinite repulsion at exactly

this distance.'

     It may also be observed that a sphere in which vibratory energy is

set up on impact cannot be regarded as a 'perfectly elastic sphere ' witb
coefficient of restitution equal to unity. The necessity of adopting Thom-
son's representation by Boscovich point-atoms is otherwise apparent
when we remember that as long as the portions of matter with which we
are dealing are capable of subdivision, so long will the energy contained
in them be capable of subdivision. Un]es5, therefore, we suppose each
molecule to consist of one or a finite number of indivisible atoms, it
would be unreasonable to expect that heat would entirely take the form

--of atomic motion.
     46. Applications to the Second Law. The simplest proof of the Second
Law of Thermodynamics based on the hypothesis of the Boltzmann-
Maxwell law of distribution of speed is that due to Mr. S. H. Barbury.^
The proof is too well known to need description here. It leads to the
same form for the entropy as Boltzmann's original investigation for
the case of a system of point-atoms.^ Although Watson and Burbnry
take the temperature as represented by the average kinetic energy of
translation of the molecules, the fact that the average energy is assumed
to be distributed equally among the coordinates shows that the proof
would be equally valid if the whole average kinetic energy were taken to
represent the temperature. Hence the proposition (when valid) does not
afford any evidence as to what part of the molecular energy plays the

part of temperature.
      Another proof has been given by R. C. Nichols,-^ and is based on the

virial equation of Clausius,

Here T is the total mean ris viva of the system, so that if Nichols' proof

be valid, it does not seem possible to reconcile the views of Tait (§ 43)
regarding the nature of temperature with the definition afforded by the

 Second Law.

    A general proof of the Second Law, based on Maxwell's generalisation

of Boltzmann's theorem, has been given by Boltzmann in 1885.'' The

  --47. Statistical Construction of Monocyclic Systems. A very interest-

ing and suggestive paper has been published by Boltzmann,' who has
shown how systems possessing monocyclic properties can be built up by
combining a large number of systems which are similar to one another,

but not individually monocyclic. This is the paper to which reference
has been made in § .37.

   A single particle moving in an elliptic orbit about a centre of foi'ce in

the focus is not monocyclic in itself, but a monocyclic system may be
built up by taking a very large number of such particles, thus forming a

stream or a kind of Saturn's ring, whose density at any point of the

orbit is independent of the time. Here, if the attraction at distance r be
fl/r'^, Boltzmann finds

where                          2Ts                                        a

                          '^=T'

Moreover, if jx is the total flux across any section up to the time t, and
ni the mass of the ring, we have

                                                                                 27r dfL

and, therefore, fqdt may be taken as a generalised coordinate of the

system.

   mAnother example is afforded by a stream of particles of total mass

performing rectilinear oscillations under a conservative system of forces.
In this case Boltzmann finds

                          dQ=2Td]o^,iT                                                            (73)

which agrees with Clausius' result (equations 14, 72). Here we may
take for the generalised velocity and momentum of the system respec-

tively,

               =q mji,                                              =s 2Tlq=2iT/ui . . . (74)

A particular case is that of a stream of particles reflected backwards

and forwards between two fixed perfectly elastic parallel walls at a dis-

     This system is strictly monocyclic.

     Boltzmann modifies this example slightly by considering the case of a

mmass formed of minute particles contained in a rectangular box, whose

sides are a, h, c, the directions of motion being parallel to the face (ah)
and inclined to the edges a at an angle=D. Taking a, h, and v as
variable, we have

and to put the last equation into Helmholtz's form we must assume

    But the kinetic energy is no longer an integrating divisor of (ZQ if we
suppose the angle T> variable. It is not hard to explain why this case

Ddiffers from the others considered by Boltzmann. The angle cannot

be considered as a controllable coordinate of the system, for it can only
be varied by acting on all the molecules individually. Moreover, it is
not a speed-coordinate, so that Helmholtz's methods are no longer applic-
able. The effect of slightly rotating the box would be not merely to
l^roduce an alteration in the angle of incidence D, but to alter the charac-
ter of the motion entirely, for the particles which are about to impinge
on the face ac would be differently affected from those about to impinge
on the face be.

     Boltzmann follows up these simple examples by a perfectly general
investigation based on Maxwell's theorem, from which it appears that
any system which conforms to the Boltzmann-Maxwell doctrine possesses
monocyclic properties analogous to those found by Helmholtz. The
results obtained by Boltzmann do not hold good, except in the particular

cases when Maxwell's theorem is valid. Two cases are considered

that in which all coordinates of the system are independent, and that
in which certain coordinates are connected by invariable relations. The
arguments employed by Boltzmann in discussing the latter case appear

wanting in rigour, thus rendering the result liable to further objections.
The remainder of the paper is chiefly taken up with a discussion of the
models referred to in our second section.

   --48. Application of Statistical Methods to Irreversible Plienoviena. In a

recent note ' Mr. E. P. CulverAvell has called attention to the principal
difficulties attending the explanation of irreversibility on the hypotheses

of the kinetic theory of gases. The general purport of his remarks may

be summarised as follows :
     (i.) Although the distribution of energy when a gas has assumed the

Boltzmann configuration (or, as Tait calls it, the ' special state ') has
been investigated, it has never been proved that a gas does actually tend
towards this ' special state.'

     (ii.) Sacli a tendency cannot be independent of the law of force

between the molecules, for if we take the case of a system of particles

attracting one another with forces varying directly as the distance, the
motion will be strictly periodic, and there will be no tendency towards

equalisation of energy.

     (iii.) The tendency cannot be independent of initial circumstances, for
if the motion of every point were I'eversed we should have a configura-
tion which would tend further and further away from the ' special state.'

      (iv.) It therefore appears probable that in estimating the tendency to

equalisation of energy among the molecules, account must be taken of
the effects of the luminiferous a3ther. The molecules cannot be considered

as forming a complete dynamical system in themselves. It seems, then,

impossible to overcome the difficulties of the kinetic theory ; all that can
be done is to shift these difficulties from the molecules on to the aether,

and they then reappear in another form.

   We will now examine how far these difficulties have been met by the

researches of those who take a less gloomy view of the question.

It is no doubt impossible, from the inherent difficulty of the problem,

to investigate any general property of non-reversible processes in a body

composed of an  infinitely large number of  molecules                                                for, when even the
                                                                                                  ;

' Problem of Three Bodies ' has not been fully solved, how can we expect

to fully solve the problem of an infinite number of bodies ?

But without doing this it is jjossible to investigate certain irreversible

phenomena by the methods of the kinetic theory, and thus to account

for the degradation of available energy under circumstances in which the

problem is soluble.

     49. Thus Tait ' has worked out the rate of equalisation of average

energy in a mixture of two kinds of spheres. He has, moreover, applied

his formula to the case of a mixture of equal parts of oxygen and nitrogen

on the supposition that the aggregate masses are equal, that the number

of molecules per cubic inch^o xlO-", and that the sum of the radii of

the molecules=3 xlO"* of an inch. He finds that the dificrence of the

average energies of the two systems of molecules will fall to '01 of its

original value in ^ X lO"'-* of a second. This result surely affords very
strong evidence in favour of a gener.al tendency towards the ' special

state.'

     Moreover, the kinetic theory has been applied to explain the phe-
nomena of heat-conduction, viscosity, diffusion of a mixture of gases,
and other irreversible processes. These have all been worked out by
Tait in the same series of papei's. One very great merit of his work is
that he has in every instance clearly set forth the assumptions on which
his proofs are based. The investigations are, therefore, not liable to

objection, as is so often the case with the work of writers who have
implicitly made similar assumptions without explicitly stating them.

    With regard to the second 'point, Sir W. Thomson has pointed out ^

that the law of the direct distance possesses unique properties distinct
from those of any other law. It is, in fact, the only law of force under
which the whole motion is strictly periodic and the equations of motion

--are completely integrable a fact sufficiently vvell known to manufac-

turers of Senate House problems. But as there is still some uncertainty

--120 KEPORT 1891.

respecting the permanent distribution of energy in a system of material

points under intermolecular forces, it would be premature to form con-

clusions regarding the tendency towards the equalisation of energy, except

in those cases where the only reactions between the points are those due

to impact.

     50. If we regard the whole matter as one of probabilities, the argu-
ment derived from reversing the system may be met without an appeal

to tiie luminiferous sether. Although a conservative dynamical system

is always reversible, the reversed motion may not unfrequently be
dynamically unstable in the highest degree. One of the best illustrations

in point is afforded by the impossibility of riding a bicycle backwards

(i.e.  with the steering  wheel  behind)                                      here the forward  motion is stable,
                                                                           ;

but the reversed motion is highly unstable.

Take, then, a system of material points or colliding spheres all tend-

ing towards the ' special state.' If the motion is slightly disturbed they

will still tend towards the ' special state,' and the effect of the disturb-

ance in modifying the character of the motion will diminish without

limit. But if we suppose at any stage of the process that the motion

of every point is exactly reversed, then the difference between the dis-

turbed and undisturbed reversed motions will increase without limit, and

the disturbed reversed motion will tend towards a very different state from
that from which we started. In a very short time we shall have entirely

different series of collisions taking place in the disturbed and undisturbed

reversed motions. When, therefore, we consider the immense number of

molecules present in any body of finite size, it is not hard to understand

that the probability of the energy tending towards an unequal distribu-

tion is infinitesimally small, for just the same reason that if any two

different substances in a minute state of subdivision have become

thoroughly mixed it is impossible to separate them again by simply

stirring them up. There is nothing inconceivable about such a separa-
tion, but the chances are so overwhelmingly against it that we may with

absolute certainty declare the separation impossible. In this manner

there is no difhculty in understanding how on statistical grounds alone
we may be able to state with absolute certainty that ' heat cannot pass of

itself from a cold body to a hot body.'

       Of course evidence of this kind is speculative, and, moreover, only

affords a possible explanation, and not a proof, of the principle of

degradation of energy.

       But, as it has been necessary to suppose space furnished throughout

with an aether in order to account for electrical and optical phenomena,

allowance must be made for the fact that this iether will in all probability

play a pi-omiuent part in thermal phenomena, more especially as it is the
medium by which radiant heat is propagated. The great velocity of

light shows that the ajther can have but a very small capacity for radiant

energy, and, therefore, that its presence will not materially affect the

results of investigations relating to reversible thermodynamic processes,

while it will certainly facilitate the dissipation of energy. It must not,

however, be thought that researches relating to heat are worthless be-

cause they do not take account of the aether ; for do not such researches

                                                          Conclusion.

     51. Although many of the researches mentioned in this report are not
unfrequently called dynamical proofs of the Second Law, yet to prove
the Second Law, about which we know something, by means of mole-
cules, about which we know much less, would not be in consonance with
the sentiments expressed at the end of the last paragraph. The most

conclusive evidence for regarding Carnot's principle as a theorem in mole-
cular dynamics lies in the remarkable agreement between the results
obtained by the methods described in the three different sections of this
report, all of which are based on different fundamental hypotheses. It
is worthy of note that the method of Clausius alone is independent of
any assumptions regarding the nature of the intermolecular forces.

     It has been proved, on each of the various hypotheses, that when a

system of molecules undergoes transformations analogous to reversible

processes in thermodynamics the molecular kinetic energy T is an inte-
grating divisor of the work c^Q communicated to the system through the
molecular coordinates. Thus any quantity proportioned to T satisfies
the definition of temperature afforded by (2), § 2. The evidence that

such a quantity possesses the properties mentioned in § 3 is far less
conclusive. These properties have never been investigated by the
methods of the first section, while, if the statistical method be adopted,
the evidence is confined to the very limited cases in which Maxwell's
theorem is valid. The methods of the kinetic theory of gases do not
afford a direct proof of any relation between the molecular kinetic
energies of two substances which are in thermal contact, but which do

not mingle.

     In the volume already alluded to in this Report, Prof. J. J. Thomson
claims to have deduced certain thermal properties of matter from the
generalised equations of dynamics without the use of the Second Law of
Thermodynamics, and he further claims that the results thus obtained
afford evidence of the connection between the Second Law and the
Hamiltonian principle. It would seem, however, that the novelty of this
point of view is not fundamentally very great, for the molecular assump-

tions involved in the proofs are identical with those required in order ta

deduce the Second Law from dynamical principles. And, moreover,
properties of temperature are assumed which, as we have just seen,

have not hitherto been satisfactorily deduced from dynamical principles.
     If, on the other hand, we decide, for the present at any rate, to regard

Carnot's Principle (like Newton's Laws of Motion) as an axiom based
on experience, the researches which we have considered show how this
principle may be reduced to a theorem in molecular dynamics by making
suitable assumptions as to the nature and motion of molecules. In this
way the reversible thermal properties of matter may be represented by
means of monocyclic or other dynamical systems, and the fundamental
equations of thermodynamics may be replaced by particular cases of the
ordinary dynamical equations. This is the point of view adopted by
Helmholtz in his valuable paper on the physical meaning of the Principle

of Least Action.'

    In conclusion we may reasonably hope that future researches in the
domain of molecular science will still further strengthen the bond of

                                                         ' Crelle, Journal, c.

dynamics and Newton's Laws of Motion.

     GrLAZEBROOK, J. Brown, and John M. Thomson, appointed for

      the purpose of considering the subject of Electrolysis in its
     Physical and Chemical Bearings.

During the past year the completed portion of Mr. Shaw's report on our

knowledge of electrolysis has been printed and circulated among the

members, and has appeared in the annual volume of the Association. So

also has the report of the discussion with Professors van t'Hoff and

Ostwald and others at Leeds, which was edited by Professor Thorpe.

Papers received from Mr. J. Brown on the subject of the electrification

of the spray thrown up from a vessel in which chemical reaction with

efiTervescence was occurring, to which attention has been directed by Mr.

Enright, and on the electrolysis of solutions of the chlorides of iodine

and bromine, were communicated to the 'Philosophical Magazine.'

The valuable theoretical and experimental work of Professor J. J.

Thomson, which has been described in the ' Philosophical Magazine ' and

in the 'Proceedings of the Royal Society,' on the discharge of electricity

through vacuum tubes, has a distinct electrolytic significance ; and some

researches of Mr. A. P. Chattock on the discharge of electi'icity from

points, which are to be described at the present meeting, are tending

in very much the same direction ; and showing that all convective

passage of electricity, whether in liquids or gases or in partial vacua, are

essentially electrolytic, taking place pi'obably by means of a series of

Grotthuss chains, and with atomic charges of the same order of magnitude

as those concerned in electrolysis proper.

Other interesting work is going on, and a document entailing a great

amount of labour which has been drawn up by the Rev. T. C. Fitzpatrick,
one of the members of the Committee on Electrical Standards, is nearly

complete                                            it will be published next year.

quakes it appearocl that the motion at the bottom of the pit was very
much less than that observed on the surface, while for small disturbances
the difference between the surface and pit records was too small to be
measurable. In 1886 a pit 18 feet in depth was sunk through dry
compact earth at the Imperial University in Tokio, at the bottom of
which seismometers were established on a brick pavement. These
seismometers and others in the Seismological Laboratory a few yards
distant when placed side by side gave records which were identical.
The work was commenced by Professor S. Sekiya, and continued by myself,
and the records obtained have now been subjected to a careful analysis
by Mr. F. Omori, a graduate of the University, who has taken from ten
to thirty waves in thirty different earthquakes and for each of these

waves calculated its amplitude, period, maximum velocity, and maximum

acceleration. Of these thirty disturbances, for each of which diagrams
were obtained on the sui'face and in the pit, three were strong and
twenty-seven were feeble. For each set of calculations referring to
a particular earthquake average values were obtained, and the average
for these average values was as follows :

    From the above it appears that for small disturbances the motion on
the surface is slightly greater than it is in the pit ; further, from an

inspection of the diagrams, it is seen that those from the pit are always
smoother than those from the surface. In severe earthquakes Mr. Omori
points out that this latter character is strongly marked.

     The ripples referred to appear amongst the waves in the early part of
a disturbance, and, as Mr. Omori suggests, may be the continuation of
the minute motions which are sometimes recorded in diagrams before the
true earthquake itself has commenced.

   A conclusion of some importance, which is confirmed by the above

observations, is that buildings which rise from a basement or which are
surrounded by an open area receive less motion than those which rise
from the surface.

The Overturning and FRACTaRiNG of Brick and other Columns.

     During the past year a long series of experiments was carried out to
determine the accelerations necessary to overturn or fracture columns of
T«rk)tis diescriptions. The columns were placed or fixed upon a truck
which could be moved back and forth through a range and with a period
comparable with what might occur in a severe earthquake. Each back
and forth motion was recorded on a band of paper running at a uniform
speed in a direction at right angles to the direction of motion of the
truck. At the instant the column overturned or was fractured a mark
was made on the paper, so that the particular wave which was being
drawn when overthrow or fracture occuri'ed could be identified.

    On the assumption of simple harmonic motion, calling the period of
this wave T and its amjalitude a, which were quantities measurable on

the diagram, the maximum velocity V, or --^~ , and the maximum ac-

--celeration, or  , could be calculated. These quantities were compared

with quantities dependent on the dimensions, density, and strength of

the columns experimented upon. The object of the experiments was to

furnish those who have to build in earthquake countries with data

respecting the quantity of motion which certain forms of structure

might be expected to withstand.

On October 15, 1884, we recorded in Tokio a maximum acceleration

of 210 mm. per sec. per sec, whilst on February 22, 1880, when Yoko-

hama was considerably damaged, such records as were obtained apparently

Aindicated 360 mm. per sec. per sec.  maximum range of motion of

100 mm. and a period of 2 seconds implies a maximum acceleration of

450 mm. per sec. per sec. As it is possible that this quantity might be

exceeded, structures in earthquake countries ought at least to be able to

withstand three times as much.

For various reasons, of which the following are important, it seems

impossible to absolutely determine the quantity of motion necessary to

overturn a body of given dimensions.

1. The body may be set in motion and be rocking with a definite
     period and amplitude when it receives the final impulse which

      determines its overthrow.

2. Bodies, like columns, standing on end have a period of oscillation
     varying with the arc through which they rock.

3. An earthquake seldom, if ever, consists of a single sudden move-
      ON THE EARTHQUAKE AND VOLCANIC PHENOMENA OF JAPAN. 127

           ment, but of a series of movements, which continually vary in
           amplitude and period.

      A4. series of earthquake waves is often accompanied by a series

           of superimposed waves.

     The theoretical investigation of the OK^erturning of a body like a
column, which, although incomplete, has yielded results comparable with

those obtained from experiment, is due to my colleague, Professor C. D.
West. The result may be expressed as follows :

      /=Let the acceleration in feet per sec. per sec. which may cause

                       overturning,

             y=the height of the centre of gravity of the column,
              a;=:the horizontal distance of the centre of gravity of the column

                 from the edge about which it may turn,

               (7=:the acceleration due to gi'avity.

Then                f=n"^.
                           y

    Experiments showed that the quantity /, which may be calculated
from the dimensions of a body, is closely related to the maximum

--acceleration, or  , which the body experienced at the time of over-

turning.

--When the period of motion is short / and  closely approximate,

but when the period is great (say two seconds) / may be 30 per cent.

    Values for F° varying between 41 and 14-8 lbs. per square inch were

determined by pulling portions of the brick and mortar columns asunder
in a testing machine.

     Corresponding to these different values of F° different values of a were

obtained.

     Out of fourteen columns which were broken, in twelve cases the values
obtained for a, when F°=14-8 lbs., were fairly comparable with the quan-

tity V^/a. In two cases where fracture may have occurred at a bad
joiat the quantity V^/a Avas more near to a when F=4'l lbs.

     As an illustration of the practical ajDplication of the above investiga-
tion, let us assume that the greatest maximum acceleration to be expected
is 1,000 mm. per sec. per sec, which is a quantity four times greater
than anything yet recorded in Tokio, and then determine the height to
which a brick column 2 feet square may be built above its foundations
and be able to withstand this motion.

      If X is the height required and iv the weight of one cubic inch of
l)rickwork=:'0608 lbs., then by substitution we derive from the above
formula

When F=5 lbs. then .'c=6ft. Sin.
When F=151bs. then a^=llft. 7 in.

A detailed account of the relationship of this formula to the formula

previously emjaloyed, together with a^n account of the experiments, is

being offered by myself and Mr. F. Omori, a graduate of the Imperial

University, to the Institution of Civil Engineers.

Earthquakes in Connection with Electric and Magnetic Phenomena.

                                        1. Magnetic Phenomena.

     The conclusion to be derived from the notes relating to magnetic
phenomena and earthquakes published in the Report for last year was
that, for Tokio at least, the records of the Magnetic Observatory, which
is continually being shaken by earthquakes, only show disturbances
which may be the result of mechanically-produced movements. Since
then I have read an account of the experiment of M. Mourreaux, chief of
the Magnetic Observatory of Pare Saint-Maur, near Paris. Having had
his instruments disturbed at the time of earthquakes, M. Mourreaux
suspended on the same stand as the magnetograph a copper bar having
the same foi-m as the magnetic one. The bifilar suspension for the copper
bar was made identical with that used for the magnet, and the movements
of each were recorded photographically.

     With three earthquakes the records for the magnet were disturbed,
whilst the records for the copper bar were not disturbed. This experi-
ment has been discussed by G. Agamemnone (' Atti dellaKeale Accademia
dei Lincei,' vol. vi., January 5, 1890), who points out that for various
reasons the period of the copper bar and the magnet must be different,
and, therefore, by a given movement one might be caused to move whilst
the other remained at rest---a conclusion with which the present writer

concurs.

    Near an active volcano, where masses of magnetic matter may be

shifted or altered in temperature, changes in magnetic elements may

possibly be observed, but, so far as observation and experiment have
hitherto gone, we are inclined to the opinion that ordinary earthquakes
are in no way connected with magnetic phenomena.

       2. Electric Phenomena.

In the Report for last year I gave the results of a comparison of the

records of several hundreds of earthquakes, and the photographic records

of atmospheric electricity from a Mascart electrometer. The observations
Awere made at the Meteorological Observatory in Tokio.
                                                        result arrived

at was that at the time of many earthquakes, especially when Tokio was

rear the epicentrum, the air often became electro-negative. In a detailed

paper on this same subject (' Trans. Seis. Soc.,' vol. xv. p. 160) it is
stated that these results ' must only be regarded as tentative,' and as

during the past year I have discovered a source of error in Mascart's

instrument, this remark must not be overlooked. Sometimes, even in

exceedingly dry weather, the instrument rapidly loses its sensitiveness,

and, if the mirror be displaced, it does not quickly return to zero. The

reason does not appear to reside in the fibre nor always in the acid, for,

if the wire dipping in the acid and attached to the needle and mirror be

taken out and washed, the sensitiveness is regained. Now the acid is

being changed weekly and the wire washed. The results which have
already been recorded having an explanation in mechanical movements

must still be regarded as tentative.

Second Report of the Committee, consisting of Lord Rayleigh,
     Sir William Thomson, Professor Cayley, Professor B. Price,
     Dr. J. W. L. Glaisher, Professor A. Gr. GtREENHILL, Professor
     W. M. Hicks, and Professor A. Lodge (Secretary), appointed
     for the purpose of calcidating Tables of certain Mathematical
      Functions, and, if necessary, of taking steps to carry out the
     Calculations, and to publish the results in an accessible form.

The first Report was in 1889. Since then values of 1q{x) have been
calculated from a'=0 to a;=6'10 at intervals of 'Ol, and considerable pro-
gress has been made in still further expanding this table, making the

interval -001. This will enable values of Io(a;) for intermediate values
of X to be read off by the help of first differences only.

     Progress has been made towards the calculations cf Ii(aO for values
of X differing by the interval -01, or, if desired, -001. The method

adopted is that of calculating the successive differential coefficients of
I) (a;) for the values of x given in the 1889 Report by means of the
 formula

and its derivatives, and interpolating by means of Taylor's Theorem.

The Committee have asked for a grant of 15L, to enable them to

employ a professional calculator to help in the continuation of the work.

First Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr. G-. J. Stmons
     (Chairman), Professor K. Meldola, Mr. J, Hopkinson, and Mr.

    A. W. Clatden {Secretary), appointed to consider the applica-

     tion of Photography to the Ehicidation of Meteorological
    Phenomena. [Drawn up by the Secretary.)

In commencing operations in the autumn of last year your Committee
considered that the first step was to make their existence and aim as
widely known as possible. Hence the chief work of the year has been
the issue of circulars inviting the co-operation of others, and the taking
of such other steps as seemed likely to help in that main object.

     The following circular was first drawn up and issued to the secre-
taries of a large number of photographic societies, field clubs, and other
associations throughout the world. Letters to a similar effect were
widely distributed through the medium of the press, and personal efforts

were made to solicit aid wherever it seemed obtainable.

  --SiK, At the Leeds Meeting of the British Association in September last the

above-named committee was formed in order to ' report upon the application of

photography to the elucidation of meteorological phenomena, and to collect and

register photographs of such phenomena.'

The success with which these instructions can be carried out necessarily depends

in a gi'eat measure upon the voluntary co-operation of others.
    Will you therefore lend us your valuable aid by making the matter known

among the members of the society you represent, and by giving us the names of any

persons resident in your neighbourhood who might be willing to further the work in

hand ?

   We shall be glad to receive copies of any photographs illustrating meteoro-

logical phenomena, or their eifects, but we should especially welcome offers of future

assistance in the shape of photographs taken in accordance with simple instructions

which will be supplied on application.

Photographs received will be numbered and registered and exliibited at the nest

meeting of the British Association.

     The Committee wish it to be understood that, hi tlte absence of any intimation to
the contraT]!, contributions to their collection will be regarded as their own propertjv

with liberty of reproduction at their discretion.

Hoping that you will co-operate in the work,

                                        I am, your obedient Servant,

     It was, however, felt that a photograph of a meteorological pheno-

menon possessed comparatively little value for scientific purposes unless
some infoi'mation could be gained as to the circumstances under which it
was taken. Again, photographers generally, and amateurs in particular,
seem to find great difficulty in securing good photographs of such things
as clouds ; therefore it seemed desirable to endeavour to ascertain whether
any brand of plate, make of lens, or special device deserved particular
recommendation. The following form was therefore printed and issued,
with a modified version of Circular A, and distributed wherever there
seemed any probability of active co-operation.

     2. The size of the plate is immaterial provided that the focos is sharp. Use a
magnifier when focussing, and for objects like clouds focus upon a distant tree or

building.

     3. Use a lens which does not distort the image.

    4. Do not touch up either negative or print.
    5. When photographing any object which is moving or changing, a series of
views taken at short intervals, so as to show the progress of the phenomenon, will

be of especial value.
     6. Whenever possible, a figure or other object of known dimensions should be

introduced, in order to serve as an approximate scale.

                                                     Cloud Plwtographj

     For heavy clouds no special apparatus is required, but exposure must be shorter
than for ordinary landscape work. For very thin clouds exposure must be extremely
short and development very cautious. Fair results may then be occasionally
obtained without special means.

     In order to obtain better and more certain results three methods have been

adopted :

          (a) Using a slow plate and rapid lens, with short exposure.
          (J) Using an ordinary plate and lens, but with a sheet of pale yellow glass in

                      front of the lens,

          (c) Using an ordinary plate and lens, but placing a plane mirror of black
                  glass in front of the lens, so that its surface makes an angle of about

                 : 33° with the axis of the lens. The image reflected in the mirror is fairly

                     easy to photograph.

     The Committee hope to receive examples of each of these processes, as well as
examples and descriptions of any other special devices which may be adopted by

observers.

                                                    Lightning Phntograpluj

When a thunderstcrm occurs at night it is very easy to photograph the flashes of

lightning.

     Fix the camera rigidly (do not hold it in the hand) and expose it to a part of the

sky where flashes are frequent.

     As soon as one flash has crossed the field of view change the plate.
     Whenever possible, count the number of seconds between seeing the flash and

hearing the beginning of the thunder. Note this time on the print or form.

    If you have two cameras some useful results may be attained by using one as
described above and holding another in the hand, pointing in about the same

direction, but kept in constant oscillation. It is hoped that two photographs of the
same flash may be thus secured.

     Another desirable experiment is to fix both cameras in the same direction, change

the plates in one after each flash, but leave the plate exposed in the second until six

or eight flashes have crossed the field of view.
    If the camera is placed in a window this must be open, as the interposition of a

window pane may give rise to multiple images.

Be particularly careful to note the exact time and direction of each flash photo-

graphed.

    A rapid lens, with a stop £ or thereabouts, should be used for lightning.
    Prints, which may be mounted or unmounted, should be sent as early as possible

to the Secretary at

                     'Waeleigh,' Tulse Hill Pakk, London, S.W.

     This work of distribution has been greatly aided by the courtesy of
the Council of the Royal Meteorological Society. But in spite of their
assistance the time available for the purposes of the Committee has besn
mainly devoted to carrying out this introductory labour and conducting

the correspondence it has involved.

     The secretary to your committee has also personally appealed to
various societies on behalf of the work in hand by the exhibition of
lantern slides in explanation of the Committee's object.
                          ON PlIOTOGRAPHr OF METEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENA.          133

      In all cases promises of future help (in the shape of photographs taken

under recorded circumstances) have been solicited, rather than the gift of
prints from old negatives.

     The result is that some progress has been made in the organisation
of a system of observers who will be on the look-out for interesting
phenomena. Such offers already number between forty and fifty, and
new names are slowly coming in. Indeed, many of the circulars inviting

such aid have been sent to such distant places that replies could hardly be
expected yet. However, as it is, the promises in hand include some from
Tasmania, Mauritius, Java, Sweden, America, and the Continent, while
those from the United Kingdom come from all parts of the country.

     Tour committee view this result with some satisfaction, because a
wide distribution and large number of observers multiply the chances of
securing records of rare phenomena. It is a case of sowing seed over a
large area, and it is only the earlier parts which have yet had time to
yield much harvest.

                                      Photographs Collected.

     The number of prints actually received up to the time of closing this
report (July 20, 1891) is not large. The total number, 153, includes 96
of clouds, 11 of lightning, 6 of damage by lightning, 2 damage by hail, 3

of the positions of meteorological instruments, G of glacier structure, 3 of

fog shadows, 8 of hoar-frost, 2 of snow-crystals, and some others. But

these can only be regarded as a first instalment of the results of the
year's work, and your committee look forward with confidence to a con-
siderable increase in their collection during the next few months.

   --The details of the collection already made can be best judged by

reference to the appended list :

              Registration of Photographs in other Collections.

     This section of tbe work has hardly been commenced. Several pro-
minent firms of professional photographers have been approached with a
view to tabulating the pictures they possess, but they have not offered
any special facilities. This is to be regretted in some ways, but there
seems x-eason to hope that another year something of the kind might

be done.
     The fine collection in the possession of the Royal Meteorological

Society has been examined. It contains a large number of very beautiful
cloud studies by Dr. Riggenbach and M. Paul Garnier, but information
as to the methods adopted by these observers and as to the conditions
under which the pictures were taken is at present wanting. Neverthe-
less the work of registering these photographs would have been taken
in hand had it not been all but impossible to' describe them properly.
The chaotic condition of cloud nomenclature seems to render it impossible
to describe the minute diSerences of structure so admirably shown in the
pictures in terms which would be generally intelligible. Many cloud
forms, especiallj' among the thinner types, are intimately related to one
another, some being only transitional phenomena during the passage of
one stable form into another. Tour committee have therefore laid special
stress in their instructions to observers upon the importance of securing
series of cloud jjictures at short intervals delineating cloud changes and
showing, as far as possible, the relations between various forms. Until
some satisfactory system of nomenclature has been devised, or until your
ON PHOTOGKAPHT OF METEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENA.  135

committee can form a compreliensive collection, it seems tlaat the accurate
registration of cloud photographs must be left in abeyance. Perhaps by
this time next year, if they are permitted to continue their work, some-

thing of the kind may be found practicable by referring other photo-
graphs to types in their own collection.

     Another important collection is in the possession of the chairman of

your committee. An early opportunity will be taken for the tabulation

and registration of its contents.

                             Methods of Cloud Photography.

      Specimens of cloud photographs have been received illustrating
several methods.

    1. By the courtesy of the Kew Committee of the Royal Society six

specimens of the photographs taken under their direction have been
placed at the disposal of your committee. These have been taken in a
special form of camera provided with a rotating shutter, the opening of
which can be varied at pleasure. The exposure given is a fraction of a
second, and the plates ai-e of the rapid gelatine bromide type. So far as
definition is concerned, these pictures leave little to be desii-ed.

     2. Mr. A. E. Western sends one printfrora a negative taken on Edwards'
medium isochromatic plate, and two taken with Carbutt's orthochro-
matic celluloid films, in all cases after placing a sheet of pale yellow glass
in front of the lens. The definition in all three is good, but the type of
cloud is one which is easy to photograph, and it does not yet appear
whether the method is of very much value for thin cirrus clouds.

     3. The secretary to your committee has made a careful trial of two

other methods.
     The first consists in placing a plane mirror of black glass in front

of the lens, so that the plane of its surface makes an angle of about
33° with the axis of the lens. This method has been theoretically
described by Dr. Riggenbach in a paper read before the Royal Meteoro-
logical Society on November 21, 1888. It is supposed to depend on the
extinction of the polarised component of the light from the blue sky. But
in practice it is found that the mirror is of great advantage, altogether apart
from any polarisation. It diminishes the brilliancy of the whole illumi-

nation, so that it becomes easy to time the exposure correctly. By this

means it is found perfectly simple to get good negatives of even very
delicate cirrus clouds on any of the ordinary brands of dry plates. The
negatives frequently require intensification in order to bring out all possi-
ble detail, and it seems that transparencies on glass or prints on bromide
paper are to be preferred to ordinary silver prints.

     The second device which has been tested is the employment of slow
plates. Very satisfactory results have been obtained by exposing in the
camera some of the plates prepared for transparency work by Mawson
and Swan. This method has not been tried so thoroughly as the other,
but enough has been done to show that it may be recommended.

     The lens used in both cases was an Optimus rapid i-ectilinear with a

stop Z With ordinary plates and the black mirror the exposure varied

from about a tenth to half of a second, and with the transpai-ency plate
about twice or three times as long.

     The experiments wiU be continued throughout the summer, and your
136 EEPOET-- 1891.

committee hope that they will soon be in a position to decide which
method is on the whole most suitable for the purpose. The black glass
method has the one great advantage that it works well with the ordinary

plates, and as the mirror may be easily removed and replaced a few cloud
pictures may be taken during any photographic excursion without the

necessity of carrying slides charged Avith plates of little use for other
purposes.

                       Photographs of Lightxixg.

The registration of photographs of lightning is beset with difficulty,
Ajust such as interfered with the description of clouds.
                                                          provisional

classification has been issued under the authority of the Thunderstorm

Committee of the Royal ]\Ieteorological Society. Thi.s, however, was

premature, and cannot be regarded as satisfactory. Hence your com-

mittee have turned their attention rather to the study of lightning than to

recording pictures of it.

The phenomena accompanying electric discharges do not seem to have

been very perfectly studied, but certain facts are known, and photographs

of lightning and of electric sparks point to others. It seems, therefore,

that no classification can be generally accepted which ignores existing

knowledge of the connection between the electrical conditions and the

character of the discharge.

The so-called black flashes have of course been disposed of. The experi=

ments described two years ago by the Secretary to your committee showed

that the appearance is due to reversal produced by some form of diffused

light having fallen upon the plate. This conclusion has been subsequently

confirmed by ^Ir. Shelford Bidwell, F.R.S., and again by Mr. Clayden in

the photograph numbered 2B. This was taken at Bath in the early

morning hours of June 25. After the flash had passed, the plate was

left exposed for a few minutes in the hojje that a second flash might

illuminate the same part of the sky. This happened, the lower part of

the field of view being brightly lit up by a flash which was itself hidden

in the clouds. Where the consequent glare crossed the undeveloped

image of the flash reversal has occurred, while no reversal can be detected

in the other portion.

It will be noticed that this flash, like many others, shows a distinct

ribbon-like structure. The repeated occurrence of this phenomenon has

already given rise to considerable discussion, and Mr. W. Marriott and

Mr. Cowper Ranyard have attributed it to a movement of the camera

during the existence of the flash. Certainly many such photographs

have been taken in cameras held in the hand or on no very firm base.

Moreover, Dr. Hofl'ert's photograiDh, No. 1 B, shows this structure well in

the successive bright flashes. Nevertheless, it must be noted that in this

last case the camera was in rapid motion, and yet the ribbon-like struc-

ture is hardly more pronounced than it is in other pictures where any

accidental movement was presumably much less. Moreoverj the photo-
graphs Nos. 2 B and 3 B show this structure very plainly, though the

camera was standing on a steady support, and movement during the flaeh

was quite out of the question.

Alternative hypotheses are that the aj^pearance is due to reflection

from the back of the plate or in the lens. If either view were true the

brighter parts of the flash should show the ribbon form the best, whereas
ON PH0T05EAPHT OF METEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENA.  137

 the contrary seems often to be the case. Again, if the former hypothesis
were true, the position occupied by the reflected light could be ascer-
tained by considering the direction of the incident light. Fact here
 disagrees with theory.

     The evidence at present obtainable therefore points to the conclusion
that a bright lightning flash may often take the form of a long sinuous
ribbon, whose sectional thickness is very different in two directions
normal to each other. Some of the appearances noticed also indicate that
the greater thickness throughout all the parts of a given flash lies in one
and the same direction, and the variations in its apparent direction are-
mei'ely an effect of perspective.

      This structure must be carefully distinguished from another, in which
several distinct flashes follow precisely similar paths side by side. Some-

times the bright flashes (which may or may not show the ribbon shape

proper) are connected by a less brilliant luminosity, which converts the
whole phenomenon into a very broad ribbon. Photographs of this class
are exemplified by Nos. 4B, 5 B. The flash represented in Dr. Hoffert's
photograph is evidently one of the same order, and the curious smudges
which cross the plate must doubtless be due to the above-mentioned
fainter light. Clearly we have here to deal with intermittent dischai'ges,.
a number of discharges following each other along the same or closely
contiguous paths. In some cases photographs of this kind show redupli-
cated images of buildings corresponding fairly well with the images of
the component parts of the dischai-ge. In such a case there seems little
room for doubt that the flashes followed the same path or paths only a
very short distance apart.

     The secretary to your committee, however, secured the photograph

No. 4 B on June 25. In this case the camera was certainly not moved.

The flash, like many others, appeared multiple to the naked eye, but as

the motion of the eyeball might have produced tliat eff'ect, although the
flashes formed the same path, little weight can be laid on that argu-
ment. Indeed, the fact that the camera was standing still and quite un-
touched is sufficient to prove that flashes of such a nature do occur. It
is really a rapid and almost simultaneous volley of flashes connected
partly hy a less vivid discharge which obliquely links the brighter lines.
There is also evident a sort of half-twist of one part of the flash around

another part.
      In order to elucidate the unexpected facts brought to light in the

numerous photographs belonging to the Royal Meteorological Society a
number of experiments have been made by your secretary upon electric
sparks obtained from an induction machine. As these tend to throw

some light upon the questions in hand, a brief account of them may not

be out of place.

     First remove the small Leyden jars from a Voss or Wimshurst
machine. The discharge is then pink in colour, of slight brilliancy, and
strongly resembles the brush discharge. If the knobs are brought
near each other the dischai'ge passes along several lines, which arrange
themselves side by side in a plane at right angles to the direction of

discharge.

    If now the condensers are introduced in the ordinary position, the
spark at once becomes more brilliant, and the pink tinge disappears.
This spark obtained from the ordinary size of condenser appears to b&
precisely the same as the commoner varieties of lightning. If larger
--138 REPORT 1891.

condensers are substitated the spark becomes thicker and brighter, and

its minor irregularities frequently disappear.
     Next remove the condensers from the machine, and connect their

inner coatings with the prime conductors, while the outer coatings are
imperfectly insulated, as, for instance, by placing them on a wooden
table. If the jars are near each other, as each spark passes between
the discharging knobs another will pass between the outer coatings.

     Gradually increase the distance between the jars. The spark be-
tween the outer coatings will become more irregular as it grows longer,
and at a certain distance it will suddenly cease. At this moment the
discharge between the knobs entirely alters its character. If the strik-
ing distance is short, the form assumed is that of a bright pink band,
generally brighter at its margins than elsewhere, and showing a beauti-

ful fluted structure. Its duration is short, but it is nevertheless easy to

see that it is a really intermittent.

     Again increase the striking distance step by step. The discharge is
still intermittent, but thin, brilliant white sparks make their appearance.
At first the pink discharge can be recognised passing obliquely between
these bright sparks, but as the distance increases the pink light disap-
pears, and. the discharge becomes a rapid volley of bright sparks.

    The photographs from No. 1 E to No. 9 E show these phenomena.

     Again, if the discharging knobs are placed some distance from the
machiue, so that the field due to their charge is but little afiected by the

movements of the machine or operator, it may often be noticed that with
ordinary bright sparks their form is repeatedly the same. No. 10 E shows

a series of sparks taken under such conditions at intervals of about one

second.

     Now, it is probable that all these forms of discharge have their
analogues in lightning. The bright sparks with small condensers are
the counterpart of the commoner type of lightning. Those from the
large Leyden jars and between the outer coatings correspond to more
powerful flashes, the latter being the 'impulsive discharge' described by
Professor O. Lodge. The volleys of bright sparks are also the type of many
observed multiple flashes. Thei'e remain only the pink discharges, and
surely these are the counterpart of the flashes which yield photographs

like No. 4 B.
      Moreover there seems to be no prima, facie absurdity in supposing

that a short series of flashes may occur during a brief time along parallel
paths. Such a phenomenon is conceivably explicable

      (a) by an identity of conditions over the whole area traversed by the

flashes

     (b) by the movemeut of the chai'ged cloud causing the conditions
which held in one place at a given moment to hold a short distance
away at another

     (c) by the movement of the air sweeping along the disturbance

caused by the first spark, so that a path of least resistance resulting
from that disturbance occupies difl"ereut positions. Your committee
would draw attention to the similarity between the appeai'ance of the
bright pink discharge and that through rarefied air. Some of the dis-

charges, Nos. 3 E to 7 E, look as if the passage of the bright sparks caused
a partial vacuum between them, and the pink sparks then struck through

this lessened resistance along the paths of the bright sparks and across
the low resisting interval between them, the slope of these transverse
ON PHOTOGRAPHY OF METEOROLOaiCAL PHENOMENA.  139

sparks being jjossibly determined by the difference of potential required
to break through what resistance there was.

    Possibly it may be found that the ribbon structure is also due
to some such phenomenon. The passage of the first flash will produce

for a short time a Lighly rarefied column of air, through which a stream

of less luminous sparks may pass until the displaced air surges back.

Resistance will then be abnormally high exactly along the track of the
first spark, and this column of extra dense air will be surrounded by a
tube (so to say) of lower resistance. Indeed, the paths of subsequent

discharges in a series may conceivably be determined either by the
outward movement of the wave of rarefaction or by the alternate com-

pression and rarefaction along the original path. In either case the

movement of the air may easily sufiBce to carry the position of least

resistance along with it. That subsequent discharges do sometimes

follow what may be called the trough of the atmospheric wave is indi-

cated by the tendency sometimes exhibited for one spark or flash to
twist partly round another.

     Howevei', your committee do not wish it to be understood that they
put forward these suggestions as definite hypotheses. They merely state
them in order to indicate various lines along which further research is
desirable. They hope, if they are permitted to continue their task for
another je&v, to add considerably to the experimental and observational
facts at present available, and possibly to reach more definite conclusions

than existing material allows.
     Before ending their report your committee feel that a passing

reference is due to the important paper read before the Royal Society in
which the Kev/ Committee described some of their results, and also to
the work which has been carried on at Berlin and elsewhere in the
photography of the so-called luminous night-clouds and of clouds in-
visible to the naked eye.

    They wish to express their thanks to the Kew Committee, to the

numerous i^ersons who have volunteered their assistance, and especially

to the Council of the Royal Meteorological Society,

     In conclusion they ask to be reappointed, with a grant of 15^., in

order that they may have an opportunity of following up the beginning

that has been made.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor 0. J. Lodge,
    Professor Carey Fosteh, and Mr. A. P. Chattock (Secretary),

    appointed to investigate the Discharge of Electricity from

      Points.

Measueejiekts have been made of the strength of field necessary to start
discharge at jjoints of radius of curvature varying from 0'7xlO"^ to
58 xlO"^ cm. The I'esults show that the field strength inci'eases rapidly
as the radius of curvature diminishes. They also point to the gas sur-

rounding the point as the seat of resistance to discharge, rather than to
the surface of the metal ; and, upon the assumption that discharge means

the breaking down of Grotthuss chains in the gas, extrapolation indicates
an atomic charge of dimensions approximating to those of the ionic

charge of electrolytic ions.
--140 REPOET 1891.

     The variations of the field strength with pressure of the gas seem to
agree with the Grotthuss chain hypothesis as far as the measurements go.

    Upon the assumption that the passage of electricity from a point to a

plate is a one-way flow, it is possible to obtain a value of the ratio of
mass moving to electricity carried by it (i.e., the electro-chemical equiva-
lent of the discharged matter) in terms of the slopes of potential and
pressure brought about by the discharge, and the density of the current

passing. Experiments are now in j^rogress to determine this ratio, rf
possible. So far they point to a number far in excess of the electrolytic
value. This may be due to error in the measurements, or, possibly, to

the presence of metal dust in the discharge.

     Measurements, also still in progress, have been made on the mechan-
ical forces which act on a point during dischai'ge. They point to interest-

+ --ing difiTerences between and electricity, and it is hoped that useful

information may be obtained as to the manner in which the two electri-
cities leave the point by further work in this direction.

     Tour Committee asks for reappointment with a grant of 50Z.

Report of the Committee, consisting o/Lord McLaren (Chairman'},
    Professor Crum Brown {Secretary), Mr. Milne Home, Dr. John
     Murray, Dr. Buchan, and the Hon. Ealph Abercromby, ap-

     pointed for the purpose of co-operating with the Scottish
     Meteorological Society in inahing Meteorological Observations
     on Ben Nevis.

Ddeing 1890 the hourly observations by night and by day at the Ben

Nevis Observatory have been carried on uninterruptedly by Mr. Omond

and the assistants, and as heretofore the five daily observations at Fort

William have been made with great regularity by Mr. Livingston. As

intimated in last report, a vitally important advance was made in the

system of observations on Ben Nevis by the opening of the low-level ob-

servatory in Fort William on July 14, 1890, for regular continuous obser-

vations. This observatory has been equipped by the Meteorological

Council Avith a complete set of self-recording instruments, such as are in

use at the first-class observatories of the Council. The directors have
thus now at their disposal the best information available for extending the

scientific and practical inquiries they have undertaken through the

Aunique facilities offered by these well-equipped observatories.  begin,

ning has also been made with an elaborate discussion of this double series

of hom-ly observations of which some account will be given in this

report.

     The directors were again able to give relief to the various members
of the observing staff by the courtesy of the following gentlemen, who

--have given their services as observers for periods varying from four to

eight weeks: Messrs. R. C. Mossman, James McDonald, M.A., and

Alexander Drysdale, M.A., B.Sc. ; and Messrs. P. Gillies and C. Stewart,
from Professor Tait's Laboratory, are now (August, 1891) assisting in
the work of observing.

For the year 1890 the following were the monthly mean pressures and

temperatures, hours of sunshine, amounts of rainfall, and number of fair

days, or days of less than 001 inch of rain, at the observatory, the mean
pressures at the Ben Nevis Observatory being reduced to 32° only, while
those at Fort William are reduced to 32° and sea-level :

this is the lowest since the observations began. In January only 4 hours
were registered, being the lowest monthly amount yet observed, but in
December the number of hours was 22, being considerably in excess of

the hours registered at stations generally over the United Kingdom

during this exceptional month.
     The rainfall was the heaviest yet recorded in any year, being 198'34

inches, and if the amount were calculated for the meteorological year
beginning with December, 1889, the annual amount would be 213-63
inches. The rainfall for October, 37'30 inches, is the highest yet recorded
in any month ; and 29'42 inches were recorded in January and 27'31

inches in March. On October 3 the rainfall was 7'29 inches, but for the

24 hours from 9 p.m. of the 2nd to 9 p.m. of the ord the extraordinary
quantity of 8'07 inches was collected. In four months the rainfall was
the highest yet recorded for these months.

     The number of days on which the rainfall was nil, or less than the
hundredth of an inch, was 83, being the fewest number of fair days of
any year since the observatory was opened. There were 17 fair days in
February, 15 in April and December, but none in January. There were
Q& days on which one inch or upwards fell. In October there were 15
such days and 1 1 in January.

     The rainfall of 1890 in the eastern part of Scotland to the south of
the Grampians was nearly everywhere iinder the average, the deficiency
being a sixth in the Border Counties. On the other hand, in north-western
districts it was about a fifth above the average. The annual average at
the observatory since 1885 is 134"50 inches, and hence the rainfall of 1890

--was 63'84 inches, or 48 per cent., above the average an excess nowhere

approached at any observing station in Scotland.
     Atmospheric pressure at Fort William was 29-860 inches, or 0-032

inch above the mean pressure. The monthly extremes were the minimum
in January and the maximum in February, these being respectively 0-229
inch below and 0-295 inch above the means of these months.

     The following shows the departures from the means of the pressure
and rainfall of the four months of heaviest rainfall at the Ben Nevis
Observatory :

sncli a distribution of pressure, but that on the contrary they point to a

widely different distribution of pressure at the height of the observatory,

4,407 feet above the sea. In large storms, with a deep barometric depres-

sion in the centre, the Ben Nevis winds are practically the same as at lower

levels ; but with smaller storms great differences are presented. In these

cases it is remarkable that with a cyclone covering Scotland, the North

Sea, and Southern Norway the winds frequently blow, not in accordance

with the sea-level isobars, but in an entirely opposite direction, suggest-

ing an outflow from the cyclone towards the anticyclone near at the

time on the other side. It is further remarkable that this outflowing

seldom or never occurs when the centre of the stoi'm is to the south or

west, but only when it lies to the north or east. If the wind on the hill-

top is not at a right, or greater, angle from the sea-level wind, it is

usually nearly the same as it ; the supposed veering of the wind at great

heights required by the theory that a cyclone is a whirling column,

drawing the air in spirally below and pouring it out spirally above, is

so seldom observed as to be the exception, and not the rule. This

important result and the analogous observation that frequently in great

storms of winds prostrated trees lie practically in one direction over wide

regions show impressively how much observation has yet to contribute

before any satisfactory theory of storms can be propounded.

The winds of other high-level European observatories, which may all

be regarded as situated in anticyclonic regions, have been examined,

and it is found that they show the closest agreement with the winds at

low levels in the same regions. This result separates the Ben Nevis

Observatory from other observatories, so as to form a class by itself, the

differentiating cause being the circumstance that Ben Nevis alone lies in

the central track of the European cyclones. This consideration emphasises

the value of the Ben Nevis observations in all discussions of weather. It
may be added that, with respect to the relation of the winds to the low-

level isobars, Ben Nevis Observatory is more pronouncedly a high-level

observatory in winter than in summer, or, more generally, in cold than
in warm weather.

Mr. Rankin has communicated to the directors a paper on the results

of the dust-counting observations of the past year. The highest number

observed was 14,400 per cubic centimetre in- April last, whilst the lowest,

0, was observed in July, 1890, and again in March, 1891 ; and here it must

be noted that ea.cli observation is really the mean of ten observations taken

at the time. The greatest amount of dust is observed when the wind is

tribution to weather prognosis afforded by the dust observations, since

they point to quite different phases of weather.

True fogs and wet mists exhibit marked differences. In fog there

is usually a considerable amount of dust ; in mist, or wet mist, usually

very little. It is observed when the number of dust particles noted is

extremely small, or even 0, thattheair is surcharged with aqueous vapour,

if such a condition be suppcsed possible, and that then, there being no

dust particles to serve as nuclei on which the vapour might condense, it
simply condenses en all exposed objects direct from the air. This has
been found to be the most wetting condition of the air, a few minutes

only being sufficient to give the observer a thorough soaking. Every

post and rope seem running over -with water, though, looking out at the
weather, one has no idea it is nearly so wet.

     Snfi&cient observations have been made to show a well-marked diurnal
variation in the numbers of dust particles. The following are the tri-

--honrly results for March, April, and May, 1891 :

generally, so that this barometer may be regarded as recording the

true pressure of the atmosphere. This was more exactly secured
in making comparisons of the two barometers by selecting only those
cases when winds at the Fort William Observatory were light. As
stated by the Committee in previous reports, the observations of the force
of the wind are estimations on a scale of to 12, the equivalent of each
figure of the scale in miles per hour having been carefully determined

by Mr. Omond by means of Chrystal's anemometer. The barometric

observations at the two observatories were reduced to sea-level hour by
hour, and the differences plus or minus were entered in columns repre-
senting the different wind forces at the higher observatory. The following
is the result of the comparison :

lines are suddenly deflected upwards. Now in such cases the de-

pression of the barometer is about three times as great as that which occurs

with an equally strong wind from other directions, and indicates clearly

the formation of a restricted region of low pressure around and outside

the observatory. Another curious and highly intei-esting result observed

with other directions of the wind is that the reduced high-level baro-

meter exceeds the I'ednced low-level barometer when the wind blows at

the rate of about ^j miles an hour. This increased pressure accompanying

wind rising up the slope of the hill may perhaps explain the small clear

space immediately on the top of a hill, otherwise cloud-topped, and the

very different force of wind on the two sides of a ridge lying about a

right angle to the direction of the wind.

    An examination has also been made of the relations of differences of

temperature at the two observatories to differences of the sea-level pressures

at the same hours. During the ten months examined the temperature

differences have ranged from the high-level observatory showing a tem-

perature 26° lower to a temperature 6° higher than the temperature at

AFort William at the time.  comparison has been made by sorting the

differences into two-degrees amounts, and instituting a comparison only

on those cases when the strength of the wind at either of the observatories

did not exceed 2G miles an hour.

The following show for each two-degi'ees difference of temperature

the difference between the reduced barometer of the top and the barometer

at Fort William, the plus sign indicating that the top barometer was the

--higher, and the minus sign that it was the lower of the two :

The Committee reported at some length, last year, and wisli to j^ostpone
a further report till next year. They desire, therefore, to be i-eappointed

without a jcrant.

Second (Interim) Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. John"

     Kerr, Sir William Thomson, Professor RiJCKER, and Mr. R. T.
    Glazebrook (Secretary), appointed to co-operate with Dr. Kerr
     in his researches on Electro-optics.

The Committee report that Dr. Kerr is continuing his experiments on
Electro-optics, and hopes to be able to get some definite results for the
meeting next year. They wish to be reappointed.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Liveing, Dr, C.

    PiAZZi Smyth (Secretary), and Professors Dewae and Schuster,
     appointed to co-operate ivith Dr. C. Piazzi Smyth in his researches
     on the Ultra-violet Rays of the Solar Spectrum.

The first proceeding of this committee after authorisation was to inquire
into all that their Secretary was proposing to do in the way of observa-

tion and record in the ultra-violet of the solar spectrum and the suf-
ficiency or otherwise of the apparatus he had already collected for the

purpose. Much correspondence followed through the autumn and in the

winter of 1890-91, and it soon became evident that only a small part of
what was scientifically necessary could be procured with the amount

voted.

      In February, 1891, however, a most agreeable surprise occurred, in
the shape of a resuscitation of a still earlier application on the same
general lines, but on a wider basis, by Dr. C. Piazzi Smyth to the Royal
Society's Government Grant Committee in July, 1890, and which he
erroneously imagined, from their silence after receiving it, had not been
approved by that body. But it had been simply kept in abeyance, and
was finally pronounced favourably upon and granted in 1891. This
measure happily relieved the British Association Committee from attempt-
ing to do altogether too ranch for its small means, though still requiring the
 utmost economy in their t.isposition, as well as their limitation to the exact
line pointed out in the resolution passed by the General Committee at
 Leeds, viz., ' to co-operate with their Secretaiy in his researches on the
 Ultra-violet Rays of the Solar Spectrum.'

     Now this part of the spectrum being absolutely invisible to the eye,
 though otherwise known fo be in the field of the Secretary's Grating

 spectroscope at the time, while the /oc2(s of the inspecting or photograpb-

                                                                                                                                      L2

ing telescope thereof varied rapidly with the smallest angular change of
its direction in spectrum place, there arose a necessity for a considerable
improvement of the focussing arrangement over and above what is usually
supplied for the visible parts of the spectrum, or had been furnished in the

present instance for all parts. But this improvement has now been accom-
plished by Messrs. T. Cooke & Sons, of York, according to a design by
the Secretary, enabling the focus to be set distinctly and solidly to the

thousandth of an inch without reference to anything but numerical tables
prepared beforehand and tested by photographic record.

     Again, however, in some of the most interesting of those ultra-violet
regions of solar spectrum light a further and more intricate difficulty of
a physical nature was found when photographing in the second order
of the Grating's spectra. For, though that operation was performed under
double shields of the darkest blue glass procurable, yet the red region of
the first order of spectrum would insist on breaking in through all ob-
stacles, and showing itself even brilliantly by means of the anomalous ultra-
red ray transmitted by the supposed most pure and densely blue, or violet,
glass known ! One possible method of getting rid of this difficulty imme-
diately seemed to be by photographing only in the first order of the

--Grating's spectrums, throughout whose violet fields there is no red band

of any other order to come in blue glass in place or not. But could
sufficient spectrum separation of lines be thereby obtained, and without

any other drawback ?

    To meet this essential problem Messrs. T. Cooke & Sons, of York,

were again applied to, and they constructed within the grant made to
the Committee an extra-large Barlow photo-achrom-concave lens, which
magnified the previous image of the inspecting telescope's object-glass
by 2*3 times, or rather more than the first order of the Grating's spec-
trums is magnified, in separation only, by the second order. And if by
the Barlow concave the magnifying is both in separation and in height
of lines (and therefore weakening to the intensity of the image), it was
hoped that longer exposures could be freely given. So that then, with

--them, would come the final trial, which has still to be made whether the

exquisite definition of the first order of spectrum cannot be lenticularly
magnified to the required degree, with less loss of that still more valuable

feature, definition, than what takes place when it is diffractionally magni-

fied (at least in the Secretary's Grating spectroscope) by resorting to ita

second order of spectrum ?
      This is the main point, then, up to which the Secretary's research has

just arrived by aid of the British Association's grant of 1890. For while

the whole of that sum has now been expended on the above-mentioned
major subjects and a number of minor improvements and working particu-
lars bearing on the same ends, and nothing further in the way of grant
is now being asked for, it leaves sufficient material in Dr. C. Piazzi
Smyth's hands for much work in the months to come. In earnest whereof
he begs to send some of his accomplished work during the last nine
months, in the shape of two album cases, each containing twenty-six of
his separately mounted and scaled but continuous solar spectrum mag-

nified photographs of lines in the violet and ultra-violet, besides a third
and thinner album case of previously taken eye-and-hand-made drawings
at the same instrument, but of the easier half only of the same subjects,
for inter-comparison of the two methods which are past, and in prepara-
tion for the third, which is to come.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor W. Grylls Adams
     {Chairman and Secretary), Sir William Thomson, Professor

     Gr. H. Darwin, Professor Gr. Chrystal, Professor A. Schuster,

     Professor KiJCKER, Mr. C. H. Carpmael, Commander Creak, the
    Astronomer Eotal, Mr. William Ellis, and Mr. Gr. M. W^hipple,
    appointed for the purpose of considering the best means of
     Comparing and Reducing Magnetic Observations.

In accordance witli the arrangements made last year for determining the
mean diurnal range from the observations taken on five days in each
month, the following list of quiet days during the year 1890 has been
selected by the Astronomer Royal as suitable for the determination of the

magnetic diurnal variations :

         Quiet Days in 1890.

    An attempt has also been made to apply the Gaussian analysis to

sudden magnetic disturbances, and, with a view to their application in
fature work, the Talues of the Gaussian coeflBcients have been obtained
for twenty different observatories, and the numerical equations formed
for the elements of magnetic force in three directions mutually at right
angles, and also the equation for the magnetic potential in terms of the
Gaussian constants to the fourth order. The observatories of Washing-
ton and Los Angeles in the United States of America are included in

this list.

      During the past year a very interesting volume has been published,
giving the magnetic observations at the United States Naval Observa-
tory at "Washington for 1888 and 1889. In accordance with the recom-
mendatioi^ made at the International Conference held at Washington in
1884 the hours adopted in these American tables are for the seventy-fifth
meridian (west of Greenwich), mean time.

      The results of the Washington observations are contained in ten

tables, as follows :

--Table I. Mean hourly values of declination for 1888-89.
--Table II. Mean hourly declination for each month of 1888-89, taken from monthly

        composite curves.

--Table III. Mean hourly values of horizont.il force for each month of 1889 in c.g.s.

         units (dynes).

--Table IV. Mean hourly values of vertical force for each month of 1889 in c.g..s.

         units (dynes).

--Tables V., VI., and VII. Hourly values of declination, horizontal force, and vertical

         force respectively.

--Table VIII. Summary of disturbances in declination during 1888-89, determined

        from the composite curve.

 Tables IX. and X.-- Observations for 1888-89 for horizontal force and dip respec-

           tively.

      In addition to the tables there are fourteen plates as follows :

   --Plate I. Examples of the daily photographic traces of declination, horizontal

 and vertical force.
      Plate II.-- Mean diurnal variation of the magnetic elements for 1889.

   --Plates III., IV., V., VI. Monthly composite curves of declination for 1888 and

  1889, each plate for six months.

    --Plates VII. to XIV. Comparisons of disturbed days of declination at Washing-

 ton, Los Angeles, Toronto (Canada), and Pawlowsk (St. Petersburg).

       The traces are all placed for the same time, and are reduced to the
 same length of base line. In the horizontal-force trace increase of ordi-
  nate denotes increase of force, and in the vertical-force trace increase of
  ordinate denotes decreasing force, and the scale-value adopted for both

  horizontal and vertical force instruments is very nearly the scale-value
  recommended in the third report of this committee to the British Asso-

  ciation (1887), viz., 1 centimetre of ordinate='0005 c.g.s. units.
      The Committee entertain hopes that another of their recommendations,

  to which attention was first drawn in their third report (1887), and to
  which attention was again drawn in their fifth and sixth reports, viz.,
  the establishment of a Magnetic Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope, is
  about to be carried out. At a meeting of the Committee held on June 2,
  1891, at which the Chairman, Sir William Thomson, Professor Riicker,
  Commander Creak, Mr. Ellis, and Mr. Whipple were present, and at which
  Mr. Gill also attended at the request of the Committee, a statement was
  drawn up with regard to the requirements for a Magnetic Observatory
  at the Cape of Good Hope, and a rough estimate of cost and maintenance
ON MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS.  151

was supplied by Mr. Whipple at the request of the Committee. It was
resolved to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty to consider a statement
of these requirements and to receive a deputation of the Committee and
other scientific men interested in the progress of terrestrial magnetism to
urge the establishment of a Magnetic Observatory at the Cape of Good
Hope, to be placed under the direction of Mr. Gill, the Director of the
Cape Royal Astronomical Observatory. In answer to Sir William
Thomson's application to the first Lord of the Admiralty, asking him to
receive a deputation on the subject, the First Lord requested that before
receiving a deputation he might have a statement of the requirements
with regard to the proposed magnetic observatory at the Cape to be asked
for by the deputation.

     At the request of Sir William Thomson a statement was laid by the
Chairman of the Committee before the first Lord of the Admiralty,
pointing out the importance of establishing a magnetic observatory at the
Cape of Good Hope and submitting a rough estimate of the cost of
observatory and apparatus and the necessary requirements.

     In a circular issued by the International Meteorological Committee,
which will meet in Munich in September next, the following questions
bearing on terrestrial magnetism are proposed for consideration :

     Question 8.-- Is it not necessary in the introduction to the publication of mag-
netic observations to give the absolute values of the normal readings of diti'erential
instruments ?

  --Question 31. Would it not be useful to come to an agreement as to the values

of the coordinates of magnetic curves registered by magnetographs ?

     To these questions, according to the opinion of this Committee, as

expressed in their reports, especially in their third report (1887), there

can be but one answer. The absolute values of the normal readings of
all magnetic instruments and their scale-values should be given in the
publication of magnetic records, and it would be convenient that the same

scale-values should be adopted at all Observatories for similar instruments.
The value recommended by this Committee for changes of horizontal and
vertical force is '0005 c.g.s. units for 1 centimetre of the scale.

     The Committee recommend that for self-registering magnetographs
the scale values for declination, horizontal force, and vertical force should
be arranged so that equal changes of ordinate correspond to equal in-
crements of absolute force in three directions at right angles to one
another, Sx, 8i/, and Sz being the changes in the horizontal force iii the
magnetic meridian, the horizontal force perpendicular to the magnetic

meridian and the vertical force respectively.
     The Committee also recommend that as far as possible the same time-

scale should be adopted for the registering magnetographs at different
Observatories, and that this scale should be 15 millimetres to the hour.

     Professor Lemstrom, of Helsingfors, also suggests the following ques-

tions for consideration :

  --Question 29. What loethod should be employed for the study of earth-currents ?
   --Question 30. What is the extent of our knowledge of atmospheric electricity,

and how should we measure it quantitatively so as to get better results '

  --Question 32. What instrument is best for studying the variations of vertical

intensity of terrestrial magnetism ?

   With regard to Question 32 the Committee are of opinion that Lloyd's
vertical-force magnetometer is a very satisfactory instrument for studying

the changes in the vertical magnetic force.

These comparisons were made with Flat, and lead to the conclusion

In November, 1890, the Association was invited by the President ot

the Board of Trade to nominate two members to reiDresent the Associa-

tion on a Committee ' On Standards for the Measurement of Electricity

Afor use in Trade.'  meeting of the Electrical Standards Committee was

held on December 2, and it was agreed to suggest to the Council of the

Association tlie names of Professor Carey Foster and j\lr. R. T. Glaze-

brook as representatives. These gentlemen were ajDpointed by the Board

of Trade together with Mr. Courteuay Boyle, C.B., Major Carden, Mr. E.

Graves, Mr. W. H. Preece, Sir Wm. Thomson, Lord Rayleigh, Dr. Jno.

Hopkinson, and Professor Ayrton.

This Committee after various meetings drew up a report, a copy of

which is printed as Appendix I. to this report.

The standards of resistance constructed in accordance with Resolution

6 of the report are now in the hands of the Secretary, and are being

compared with the standards of the Association.

Numerous experiments on the methods of constructing Clark's cells,

and on the electromotive force of such cells, have been made at the

Cavendish Laboratory by Mr. Wilberforce, Mr. Skinner, and the Secre-

tarj'. These are still incomplete, but the experiments so far as they have

been finished lead to the value 1-434 volts at 15^ for the E.M.F. of the cell.

The value found by Lord Rayleigh was 1'435 at the same temperature.

Mr. I'itzpatrick has continued his experiments on the resistance of

silver, and an account of these will be given in a future Report.

The Committee ask for reappointment with omission of the names of

Principal Garnett and Mr. H. Tomlinson, and addition of those of Dr. G.

Johnstone Stoney and Professor S. P. Thompson. They recommend that

Professor Carey Foster be Chairman, and Mr, R. T. Glazebrook Secre-

tary. They further ask to be allowed to retain an unexpended balance of last

year's grant, amounting to 171. 4s. 6d., as well as for a new grant of 10/.

   Repokt of the Electrical Standards Committee appC'Ixted by the
                                          Board op Trade.

 To the Eiglit Honourable Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, Bart., 3LP., President
                                        of the Board of Trade.

     In compliance with the instructions contained in your Minute of the
16th December last, that we should consider and report whether any, and,
if so, what action should be taken by the Board of Trade under section 6
of the Weights and Measures Act, 1889, with a view to causing new
denominations of standards for the measurement of electricity for use for

trade to be made and duly verified, we have the honour to submit the

following report

    1. Before coming to a decision as to the points referred to us, we

were anxious to obtain evidence as to the wishes and views of those
practically interested in the question, as well as of Local Authorities

who are concerned in the administration of the Weights and Measures

Acts.
ON STANDARDS FOR USE IN ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS. 155

2. With this view we prepared draft resolutions embodying the pro-

posals which, subject to further consideration, appeared to us desirable,

and forwarded copies to the representatives of various interests for criti-

Wecism. Copies were also forwarded to the Press.  also invited the

following bodies to nominate witnesses to give evidence before us :

The Association of Chambei's of Commerce of the United King-
       dom.

The Association of Municipal Corporations.
The London County Council.
The Loudon Chamlaer of Commerce.

     3. In response to this invitation the following gentlemen attended and

gave evidence :

          On behalf of the Association of Chambers of Commerce, Mr.
                Thomas Parker and Mr. Hugh Erat Harrison.

          On behalf of the London Council, Professor Silvanus Thompson.
          On behalf of the London Chamber of Commerce, Mr. R. E.

                    Orompton.
           The Association of Municipal Corporations did not consider it

                   necessary to offer any oral evidence, but the following resolu-

                tion passed by the Law Committee of that body, was adopted

                   by the Council of the Association :
                      ' The Committee are of opinion that, assuming that the
                           science of electricity has advanced so far that it is now
                                 possible properly to define the three units referred to
                              in the Board of Trade letter,' (i.e., the ohm, ampere,
                              and volt) ' and to construct an instrument for the
                               purpose of standard measurement, the time has
                              arrived for the Board of Trade to take action thereon.'

     4. In addition to the witnesses above referred to the following gentle-

men were invited to give evidence, and we are indebted to them for

valuable information and assistance.

             Dr. J. A. Fleming.
             Dr. Alexander Muirhead.

   We5. also had the advantage of the experience and advice of Mr.

H. J. Chaney, Superintendent of Weights and Measures, who, at the
request of our Chairman, was present at our meetings.

     6. After a careful consideration of the questions submitted to ns, and

the evidence given by the various witnesses, we have agreed to the follow-

ing resolutions :

                                                            Resolutions.

1. That it is desirable that new denominations of standards for the
      measurement of electricity should be made and approved by
      Her Majesty in Council as Board of Trade standards.

2. That the magnitudes of these standards should be determined
       on the electro-magnetic system of measurement with reference
      to the centimetre as unit of length, the gramme as unit of
       mass, and the second as unit of time, and that by the terms
      centimetre and gramme are meant the standards of those
       denominations deposited with the Board of Trade,
156 REPORT--1891.

          3. That the standard of electrical resistance should be denominated
                 the ohm, and should have the value 1,000,000,000 in terms of
                 the centimetre and second.

          4. That the resistance offered to an unvarying electric current by
                 a column of mercury of a constant cross sectional area of one
                 square millimetre, and of a length of 106'3 centimetres at the
               temperature of melting ice may be adopted as one ohm.

          5. That the value of the standard of resistance constructed by a
                 committee of the British Association for the Advancement of
                Science in the years 1863 and 1864, and known as the British

               Association unit, may be taken as "9866 of the ohm.

          6. That a material standard, constructed in solid metal, and veri-
                  fied by comparison with the British Association unit, should
                 be adopted as the standard ohm.

          7. That for the purpose of replacing the standard, if lost, destroyed,
                or damaged, and for ordinary use, a limited number of copies
                 should be constructed, which should be periodically com-

              pared with the standard ohm and with the British Associa-

                      tion unit.

          8. That resistances constructed in solid metal should be adopted
                 as Board of Trade standards for multiples and submultiples of
                  the ohm.

          9. That the standard of electrical current should be denominated
                 the ampere, and should have the value one- tenth (O'l) in
                 terms of the centimetre, gramme, and second.

         10. That an unvarying current which, when passed through a

                   solution of nitrate of silver in water, in accordance with the

                    specification attached to this report, deposits silver at the

         11. That an alternating current of one ampere shall mean a cur-

           12. That instruments constructed on the principle of the balance,
                  in which by the proper disposition of the conductors, forces
                 of attraction and repulsion are produced, which depend upon

               the amount of current passing, and are balanced by known
                 weights, should be adopted as the Board of Trade standards

                 for the measurement of current whether unvarying or alter-

                     nating.

          13. That the standard of electrical pressnre should be denomi-

           14. That the electrical pressure at a temperature of 62° F. between

               the poles or electrodes of the voltaic cell known as Clark's

ON STANDARDS FOR USE IN ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS.  157

16. That instrnments constructed on the principle of Sir W. Thom-

      son's Quadrant Electrometer used idiostaticallj, and for high
       pressures instruments on the principle of the balance, electro-
      static forces being balanced against a known weight, should
      be adopted as Board of Trade standards for the measurement
       of pressure, whether unvarying or alternating.

   We7. have adopted the system of electrical units originally defined

by the British Association for the Advancement of Science ; and we have

found in its recent researches, as well as in the deliberations of the Inter-
national Congress on Electrical Units, held in Paris, valuable guidance

for determining the exact magnitude of the several units of electrical

measurement, as well as for the verification of the material standards.

   We8. have stated the relation between the proposed standard ohm.

and the unit of resistance originally determined by the British Associa-
tion, and have also stated its relation to the mercurial standard adopted

by the International Conference.

   We9. find that considerations of practical importance make it un-

desirable to adopt a mercurial standard, we have, therefore, preferred to

adopt a material standard constructed in solid metal.
     10. It appears to us to be necessary that in transactions between

buyer and seller a legal character should henceforth be assigned to the

units of electrical measurement now suggested, and with this view, that

the issue of an Order in Council should be recommended, under the

Weights and Measures Act, in the form annexed to this report.

                      Specification kefeeked to in Resolution 10.

     In the following specification the term silver voltameter means the
arrangement of apparatus by means of which an electric current is passed
through a solution of nitrate of silver in water. The silver voltameter-
measures the total electrical quantity which has passed during the time
of the experiment, and by noting this time the time-average of the
current, or, if the current has remained constant, the current itself can

be deduced.
     In employing the silver voltameter to measure currents of about

1 ampere the following arrangements should be adopted. The kathode
on which the silver is to be deposited should take the form of a platinum
bowl not less than 10 cm. in diameter, and from 4 to 6 cm. in depth.

     The anode should be a plate of pure silver some 30 square cm. in area
and 2 or 3 millimetres in thickness.

      This is supported horizontally in the liquid near the top of the solu-
tion by a platinum wire passed through holes in the plate at opposite

corners. To prevent the disintegrated silver which is formed on the
anode from falling on to the kathode, the anode should be wrapped round
with pure filter paper, secured at the back with sealing wax.

     The liquid should consist of a neutral solution of pure silver nitrate,
containing about 15 parts by weight of salt to 85 parts of water.

     The resistance of the voltameter changes somewhat as the current
passes. To prevent these changes having too great an effect on the-
current, some resistance besides that of the voltameter should be inserted
in the circuit. The total metallic resistance of the circuit should not be

less than 10 ohms.
--158 REPORT 1891.

                                Method of Mold-)} g a Measurement,

     The platinum bowl is washed with nitric acid and distilled water,

dried by heat, and then left to cool in a desiccator. When thoroughly

dry it is weighed carefully.
     It is nearly filled with the solution, and connected to the rest of the

circuit by being placed on a clean copper support, to which a binding
screw is attached. This copper support must be insulated.

     The anode is then immersed in the solution so as to be well covered
by it and supported in that position ; the connexions to the rest of the
circuit are made.

     Contact is made at the key noting the time of contact. The current
is allowed to pass for not less than half an hour, and the time at which
contact is broken is observed. Care must be taken that the clock used

is keeping correct time during this interval.

     The solution is now removed from the bowl and the deposit is washed
with distilled water and left to soak for at least six hours. It is then
rinsed successively with distilled water and alcohol and dried in a hot-air

bath at a temperature of about 160'' C. After cooling in a desiccator it
is weighed again. The gain in weight gives the silver deposited.

     To find the current in amperes this weight, expressed in grammes,
must be divided by the number of seconds during which the current has
been passed, and by ·001118.

     The result will be the time average of the current, if during the

interval the current has varied.
     In determining by this method the constant of an instrament, the

current should be kept as nearly constant as possible, and the readings
of the instrument taken at frequent observed intervals of time. These
observations give a curve from which the reading corresponding to the
mean current (time average of the current) can be found. The current,
as calculated by the voltameter, corresponds to this reading.

       Pkovisioxal Memorandum on the Preparation op the Clark's
                                              Standard Cell.

                                                  Definition of the Cell.

      The cell consists of zinc and mercury in a saturated solution of zinc
sulphate and mercurous sulphate in water, jJi^epai'ed with mercurous
 sulphate in excess, and is conveniently contained in a cylindrical glass

 vessel.

                                       Preparation of the Materials.

   --1. The Mercurij. To secure purity it should be first treated with acid
--in the usual manner, and subsequently distilled in vacuo.

      2. The Zinc. Take a portion of a rod of pure zinc, solder to one end
 a piece of copper wire, clean the whole with glass paper, carefully remov-
 ing any loose pieces of the zinc. Just before making up the cell dip the
 zinc into dilute sulphuric acid, wash with distilled water, and dry with a

 clean cloth or filter paper.

   --3. Tlie Zinc Sul})hate Solution. Prepare a saturated solution of pure

 (' pure re-crystallised ') zinc sulphate by mixing in a flask distilled water
 with nearly twice its weight of crystals of pure zinc sulphate, and adding
      ON STANDARDS FOR USE IN ELECTBICAL MEASUREMENTS. 159

a little zinc carbonate to neatralise any free acid. The whole of the

crystals should bo dissolved with the aid of gentle heat, i.e. not exceeding

a temperature of 30° C, and the solution filtered, while still warm, into

--a stock bottle. Crystals should form as it cools.
     4. The Mercuro'U'i Sulphate. Take mercurous sulphate, purchased as

pure, and wash it thoi'oughly with cold distilled water by agitation in a

bottle ; drain olF the water, and repeat the process at least twice. After
the last washing drain off as much of the water as possible.

Mix the washed mercurous sulphate with the zinc sulphate solution,

adding sufficient crystals of zinc sulphate from the stock bottle to ensure

saturation, and a small quantity of pure mercury. Shake these up well

together to form a paste of the consistence of cream. Heat the paste

sufficiently to dissolve the crystals, but not above a temperature of 30°.

Keep the paste for an hour at this temperature, agitating it from time to

time, then allow it to cool. Crystals of zinc sulphate should then be

distinctly visible throughout the mass ; if this is not the case, add more

crystals from the stock Ijottle, and repeat the jarocess.

This method insures the formation of a saturated solution of zinc and

mercurous sulphates in water.

The presence of the free mercury throughout the paste preserves the

basicity of the salt, and is of the utmost imjaortance.

Contact is made with the mercury by means of a platinum wire about

No. 22 gauge. This is protected from contact with the other materials of

the cell by being sealed into a glass tube. The ends of the wire project

from  the  euds of  the  tube                        one end  forms  the  terminal, the  other  end
                                                  ;

and a portion of the glass tube dip into the mercury.

                                            To set up the Cell.

    The cell may conveniently be set up in a small test tube of about

2 cm. diameter, and 6 or 7 cm. deep. Place the mercury in the bottom
of this tube, filling it to a depth of, say, 1'5 cm. Cut a cork about
·5 cm. thick to fit the tube ; at one side of the cork bore a hole through
which the zinc rod can pass tightly ; at the other side bore another hole
for the glass tube which covers the platinum wire ; at the edge of the
cork cut a nick through which the air can pass when the cork is pushed
into the tube. Pass the zinc rod about 1 cm. through the cork.

     Clean the glass tube and platinum wii^e carefully, then heat the
exposed end of the platinum red hot, and insert it in the mercurv in
the test tube, taking care that the whole of the exposed platinum is

covered.

     Shake up the paste and introduce it without contact with the upper
part of the walls of the test tube, filling the tube above the mercury to a
depth of rather more than 2 cm.

     Then insert the cork and zinc rod, passing the glass tube through the
hole prepared for it. Push the cork gently down until its lower surface
is nearly in contact with the liquid. The air will thus be nearly all
expelled, and the cell should be left in this condition for at least twenty-
four hours before sealing, which should be done as follows :

    Melt some marine glue until it is fluid enough to pour by its own
weight, and pour it into the test tube above the cork, using sufficient to
cover completely the zinc and soldering. The glass tube should project

above the top of the marine glue.
--160 EEPORT 1891.

    The cell thus set up may be mounted in any desirable manner. It is
convenient to arrange the mounting so that the cell may be immersed in
a water bath up to the level of, say, the upper surface of the cork. Its
temperature can then be determined more accurately than is possible
when the cell is in air.

Interim Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Cayley,

     Professor Sylvester, Mr. A. K. Forsyth, and Professor A. Lodge
     (Secretary), appointed for the purpose of carrying on the
     Tables connected ivith the Pellian Equation from the point
     where the ivork ivas left by Degen in 1817.

A LASGE part but not the whole of the work has been completed, but the

Committee hope to have it completed in time for next year's meeting of
the Association.

      lOL of the grant of 15L has been expended.

Seventh Report of the Committee, consisting of Sir G. Gr. Stokes
     (Chairman), JProfessor Schuster, Mr. Gr. Johnstone Stonet, Sir
     H. E. Koscoe, Captain Abney, Mr. Whipple, Professor McLeod,

     and Mr. Gr. J. Symons (Secretary), appointed for the purpose

     of considering the best methods of recording the direct Intensity
      of Solar Radiation.

Your Committee have to report that, after considerable search, Professor

Schuster found the thermometers constructed for Professor Balfour

Stewart for use with the apparatus designed by and constructed for

him, and that the apparatus and a mass of correspondence relating thereto

had been placed in Professor McLeod's hands. He reports that he has

tested all the thermometers, and made observations with the instrument

when opportunity has offered. He has found it desirable to provide a

screen to prevent the action of the sun on the outside of the instrument

affecting too much, or too unequally, the reading of the internal thermo-

meters. It was always contemplated that the action of the sun on the

case of the instrument would affect  the  embedded  thermometers                                                        but as
                                                                                                                     ;

care was taken that the central thermometer should be prompt in respond-

ing to changes of temperature, while the embedded thermometers, in

consequence of the way in which they were protected, should change but

elowly, it was expected that the difference between the temperatures

marked by the central thermometer and by the embedded thermometer

respectively would be sensibly proportional to the intensity of solar

radiation, notwithstanding the changes of temperature of the outer case.

This anticipation, the correctness of which is of vital importance to the

success of the instrument, has not, however, as yet been tested experi-

mentally, and the trials would require to be made under specially favour-

able atmospheric conditions. The Committee hope to report definitely

in the course of another year as to the utility of the apparatus and

desire reappointment without any grant.

by exposing to direct sunliglit and tbe ordinary atmospheric inflaences,
patterns of silks, wool, and cotton, specially dyed with the various
natural and artificial colouring matters.

      The work of purifying these colouring mattei-s, dyeing the patterns,
recording the dyed and faded colours of each pattern, &c., &c., must
necessarily require much time. Moreover, owing to the very large
number of colours to be examined, the long exposure needed to give
useful results (one year at least), and the limited capacity of the exposing-
frame employed, the work will naturally proceed but slowly, and will
extend over a period of some years.

      During the past year the Secretary of the Committee has been
engaged in collecting samples of the colouring matters required for the
investigation, and in making preliminary exposure experiments with the
view of determining the best method of procedure to be adopted.

     Having decided to expose the patterns in groups according to colour,
the work of pui-ifying and dyeing with the red colouring matters has
been begun, and is now in progress in accordance with a scheme in the
hands of members of the Committee.

     Of the 20^. originally granted to the Committee at the last meeting
of the Association in Leeds, the sum of \7l. 10s. has been expended in
the purchase of the necessary silk, wool, and cotton material, also an
exposing frame, which has been erected at Adel in the neighbourhood of

Leeds.

     Particulars of this expenditure have been forwarded by the Chairman
of the Committee to the General Treasurer.

Report (provisional) of a Committee, consisting of Professors

    M'Leod and W. Eamsay, and Mr. W. A. Shenstone (Secretary),

     appointed to investigate the Influence of the Silent Discharge

    of Electricity on Oxygen and other Gases.

The Committee regrets to state that, owing to various circumstances,

very little further progress has been made during the past year. The

necessary means for securing assistance in part of the work have, how-

ever, lately been secured, and its continued progress may therefore now

be looked for                                                                       and it is recommended that the Committee be reappointed.
                                                                                 ;

No grant is asked for, as the necessary apparatus is at the command

of the Committee.

Third Report of the Committee, consisting of Professors H.
     M^LEODi Chairman), Eoberts-Austen (Secretary), and Eeinold,

     and Mr. H. Gr. Madan, appointed for the Continuation of the

The collection and verification of the titles of papers on spectroscopy

have been continued during the past year, but there is not yet suflGcicnt
matter for publication.

     The Committee desire to be reappointed.

Fifth Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Tilden and
    Professor Armstrong {Secretary), appointed for the pw^ose of
    investigating Isomeric Naphthalene Derivatives. {Drawn up

     by Professor Armstrong.)

   --The isomeric d'uMoronaiMlmlenes. Since the publication of the pre-

vious report Mr. Wynne and the writer have completed their examination
of the dichloronaphthalenes. As mentioned in the third report, no

fewer than twelve isomerides were reputed to exist ; one of these, however

-- --strange to say, the a-modification, the oldest member of the set has

proved to be non-existent as a distinct isomeride, being a mixture of two
others inseparable by the ordinary methods of crystallisation ; while
another has been shown to have been improperly ranked as a dichloro-
derivative, being a trichloronaphthalene. The remaining ten have been
characterised and their constitution determined by logical and consistent
arguments, which leave no doubt that they actually are the ten dichloro-
naphthalenes which, according to theory, can exist if the simple double

hexagon formula for naphthalene be adopted.
     The formulte of the ten dichloronaphthalenes are given in the table

below, those of the acids into which they are converted on sulphonation
being given in the second column of the table, and those of the corre-
sponding trichloronaphthalenes in the third. In this table S is printed

for SO3H ; the melting points of the chloride and amide of the acid are

indicated below the symbol of the acid.'

     One of these exceptions is that afforded by the formation from napli-
thalene 1 : 3' disuliilionic acid on nitnition of a nitro-acid of the formula

(cf. 'Chem. Soc. Proceedings,' 1801, p. 27) ; this acid, however, is but a
subsidiary product, the main product being an acid of the formula

                                                                  NO,, R

It has long been known that when the 1 : 4' disulphonic acid is

nitrated, it  yields  an  ct-nitro-acid                                                      recently  Mr. Wynne  and  the writer
                                                                                          ;

Lave found that the product also contains the isomeric /3-nitro-acid.

Other exceptions are afforded by the production of beta-chloro- and

bromo- naphthalene on cblorination and brominationof naphthalene;' and

by the pi'eSence of a certain proportion of beta-naphthylamine in com-

--mercial alpha-naphthylamine a proof that naphthalene yields some beta-

nitronaphthalene on nitration ; the writer's attention has been called to

this last fact both by Dr. H. Caro and by Professor Noelting.

Lastly Mr. Rossiter and the writer have found that beta-naphthol

when brominated yields a dibromo-derivative of the formula

                                                                                             Br

and in this case there appears to be no alpha-compound formed, so that
the departure from the alpha-law is complete.

     But the explanation of these results is not difficult. In no case
probably is the substitution derivative the direct product of change ; but
its formation is preceded by that of an addition compound. This is
generally admitted in the case of chloro- and bromo-derivatives, but
evidence of the formation of addition compounds has not hitherto been
forthcoming in other cases. Mr. Rossiter and the writer, however, have
recently given proof that a compound with nitric acid is initially formed
in the process of nitration.'^ Obviously, in the case of a symmetrical
molecule such as that of bromine, either an alpha- or a beta- derivative will
result, according as either the beta- or the alpha-atom of bromine becomes
eliminated from the bromide, thus :

The alpha-law in this case is expressed by saying that in the main the
tendency is for the beta-bromine atom to be removed.

     In the case of a dissymmetrical molecule, such as that of nitric acid,
the formation of the one or the other derivative will depend on the
nature of the addition compound i.e., on the distribution of the radicles

--of the acid assuming them to be ' distributed ' when addition takes

place, thus :
                                                                             NO,

In this case the alpha-law is expressed in the statement that in the main
the tendency is for the acid radicle to assume an alpha-position in the
addition compound first formed.

    This question has already been discussed by Mr. Wynne and the

writer with reference to the tetra-chlorides of naphthalene and of its
derivatives, naphthalene tetrachloi-ide affording the three possible di-

     The influence of the substituent both as affecting tlie addition of
chlorine and the elimination of hydrogen chloride is especially note-
worthy. It will be seen that the sulphochlorides behave alike, but the
two chloronaphtbalenes dissimilarly towards chlorine, and that each
compound decomposes in a manner peculiar to itself on treatment with

alcoholic potash.

     As yet no evidence has been obtained that a heta-hromo-, chlorp-, or
nitro-derivative may result by isomeric change from a previously formed

aZp^a-derivative.

     With regard to the suIpJwnic acids, on reference to the previous
table in which the constitution of the acids formed on sulphonating
the ten dichloronaphthalenes is indicated, it will be observed that in some
cases an a- and in some cases a /3-sulphouic acid is formed, or a mixture
of both. Mr. Wynne and the writer have expressed the opinion that the
a-acid is always initially produced, and that in some cases this is so
unstable that it spontaneously passes over into the ^-isomeride and
escapes observation, while in others it is partially preserved. They base
this conclusion on the fact that in all cases hitherto studied in which both
acids are formed it is possible to convert the a- into the y8-acid by heating.
Thus 1 : 2-dichloronaphthalene affords about two-thirds a- and one-third
yS-acid ; but when the product is heated the latter is practically the sole
product. In like manner the initial product of sulphonation from

 1 : 3-dichloronaphthalene contains about one-fifth /3-acid ; but if it be
heated at 160° during eighteen hours complete convei'sion into the yS-iso-

meride is effected.
      Should this conclusion with reference to the manner in which beta-

 sulphonic acids are formed be ultimately established it would follow that,
unlike nitric acid, sulphonating agents regularly act in one way, and that
the formation of the addition compound takes place in such a manner
 that the sulphonic radicle always attaches itself in an alpha-position.

   --Isomeric cltange in the case of sulphonic acids. The problems which

 this subject presents are of extreme interest ; some idea of their character

is afforded by the following example. When heated at about 150-160'*

 1 : 4 a-chloronaphthalene sulphonic acid undergoes a change into the more

 symmetrical ftZ^/tot-isomeride, while 2 : l'-y8-chloronaphthalenesulphonic
 acid is converted in a similar manner into the more symmetrical leta-

--isomeride results which may be regarded as indicative of a tendency to a

 final state of symmetry, thus :

position ultimately taken up by the SO3H radicle appears to be deter-

mined by the beta-chlorine-atom, perhaps because the /8-salphonic acids
ai'e the most ' degraded ' products, thus :

    With reference to these examples it may be pointed out that the

apparent passage of the sulphonic radicle in the one case from one
nucleus into the other, in another from an alpha- into the contiguous beta-,
and in a third from an alpha- into the more distant beta-position, are
remarkable variations of the phenomenon of intramolecular mobility.

     There is a striking difference in the behaviour of the 1 : 4, 1 : 4', and

1 : 2 oa-dichloronaphthalenes, to which attention may be directed, the non-
formation of the acid containing a chlorine atom and the sulphonic radicle
in the 1:1' position being noteworthy, thus :

     In the case of the 1 : 4 and 1 : 4' compounds the sulphonic radicle is
obviously influenced in two directions, and may be said to take up a
mean position.

    A case of isomeric change which at present appears altogether para-

doxical is that which is said to occur on heating sodium naphthionate

=(NH, : SOsNa 1 : 4) at 200-250°, whereby it is converted into the

isomeric 1 : 2-compound.

     The foregoing brief reference to the work of the Committee will
suffice to show that the study of naphthalene derivatives is fraught with
interest, more especially as it is to be anticipated that results of general

application will be obtained in the course of the inquiry.

     McLeod, Pickering, Eamsay, and Young and Drs. A. R. Leeds
     and NicoL (Secretary), appointed for the purpose of reporting
      on the Bibliography of Solution.

During the past year no progress has been made with the work of
cataloguing the papers on Solution in the few remaining selected

journals.

     The Committee invite the co-operation of members who have access
to large scientific libraries and are willing to take an active part in the

work.

Fifth Report of the Committee, consisting of Professors Tilden

    and Eamsay and Dr. Nicol (Secretary), appointed for the

     picrpose of investigating the Properties of Solutions.

The Committee have to report that, owing to the pressure of other work

but little progress has been made with experiments on the atomic

volumes of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen when substances containing

Athese elements are dissolved in water or other solvents.  preliminary

research on the volume of oxygen in the oxy-acids of chlorine, bromine,

and iodine has been completed with somewhat startling results, which

lead the Committee to hope that valuable data will be obtained when
the work is complete.

Third Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Egberts-

    Austen {Chairman), Sir F. Abel, Messrs. E. Eiley and J.
    Spiller, Professor J. W. Langley, Mr. G. J. Snelus, Professor
    Tilden, and Mr. Thomas Turner (Secretary), appointed to

    consider the best method of establishing an International
    Standard for the Analysis of Iron and Steel. (Drawn up by

      the Secretary.)

In the two previous reports of this Committee the objects of the
Committee were defined, and an account was give a of the preparation
and distribution by the American Committee of four out of the five

international steel standards which Professor Langley had been requested
and had kindly undertaken to prepare. A year ago it was hoped that a

final report would be presented at the Cardifi' meeting, but, unfortunately,

this hope has not been realised, and the completion of the work has been

deferred. In the second report mention was made of the fact that the
American Committee had entered upon an investigation of the relative

accuracy of different methods of analysis, particularly in connection with
the estimation of carbon in steel. This work was not considered within

the province of the British Association Committee when its obiects were

defined in accordance with the discussion which took place at Bath and
with subsequent correspondence with Professor Langley.

     The British Association Committee have during the past year care-
fully considered the course of action taken by the American Committee
and the position of British analysts now that the scope of the inquiry
entered into by the former has been thus enlarged, and it has been

considered advisable to publish the results of the determinations of the

British analysts as soon as their work is completed. This view was
communicated to Professor Langley, who in a letter received on August 7,
1891, endorses the proposed publication of the results hitherto obtained
by the British Association Committee.

     Owing to the very short time which has elapsed since the receipt of
Professor Langley's letter and the fact that two of the British analysts
have not yet forwarded their reports to the Committee, it has not yet
been possible to institute a comparison of results obtained, but no time

will be lost in completing the examination of the four standards at present
in hand and in then prejjaring a report on the English results. Dr.

Wedding has informed Professor Langley that the work of the German
Committee is now nearly completed.

     The fifth standard has not yet been prepared, some difficulty having
been met with in obtaining so large a quantity of mild steel of perfectly
uniform composition. It was originally proposed to make the standard
of basic steel, but it was urged that greater uniformity could be obtained
with crucible metal. Professor Langley states that he has made several
attempts to make crucible steel sufficiently low in carbon, but finds it
impossible to do so in the plumbago crucibles used in the United States.
This matter is now under consideration, and it is hoped the fifth standard
will be prepared shortly.

Report (jprovisional) of a Committee, consisting of Professors H. E.

     Armstrong and W. E. Dunstan and Messrs. C. H. Bothamley
     and W. A. Shenstone (Secretary), appointed to investigate the
     direct formation of Haloid Compounds from pure materials.

Having confirmed "VYanklyn's early observation that carefully dried
chlorine was practically without action on sodium, R. Cowper in 1883
(' Chem. Soc. Journ.' 1883, pp. 153-155) made a number of experiments
on the behaviour of dried chlorine towards other metals, and in several
cases found that if dried by contact with freshly-fused calcium chloride
it was without action. Thus Dutch metal was apparently still unacted
on after three months' exposure in the dried gas ; and zinc, in the form of
foil, and magnesium wire were also unattacked. Silver and bismuth,
however, were slightly acted on, and tin, antimony, and arsenic were
rapidly attacked ; mercury appeared to be acted on as rapidly by dried
chlorine as by the moist gas.

      Pringsheim has since shown that, even in tlie case of hydrogen and
chlorine, the interaction is affected by the presence of moisture.

      These, and similar observations by H. B. Dixon and others with
reference to the formation of oxides from dry materials, render it desirable
to more fully elucidate the conditions which determine the formation of

direction that the Committee are woi'king.

Mr. Shenstone has already obtained results which are both interest-

ing and suggestive. Chlorine prepared in the ordinary manner dried by

exposure in contact with phosphoric oxide during several months was

--found to very readily attack mercury a result in accordance with

Cowper's observation. Nevertheless chlorine prepared in another

manner was found to behave differently. With the object of testing the

quality of chlorine prepared by heating platinous chloride in vacuo, tubes

of such chloi'ine, dried by contact during several hours with phosphoric

oxide, were opened under highly-purified recently-heated mercury

although the surface of the mercury in contact with the gas was very

quickly tarnished, no sensible absorption occurred during many hours in
dayhght, but afterwards absorption took place, at first gradually, and

subsequently with tolerable rapidity. Several such experiments were
made with chlorine prepared from different specimens of platinous chlo-
ride, and in every case a colourless gaseous residue, not exceeding 5 per
cent., was obtained, which proved to be partly soluble in water, partly in

alkaline pyrogallate, and partly insoluble, (? Nitrogen.) The fact that

absorption at first took place with exceeding slowness, and subsequently

proceeded at a more and more rapid rate, is apparently a significant

indication that the interaction of chlorine and mercury is conditioned by

the presence of some third substance, and the importance of continuing

the enquiry is unquestionable.

It is probable that the impurities in the gas from platinous chloride

--are derived from a basic compound. Mr. Shenstone finds that platinous

chloride is to a slight extent volatile a fact which is ordinarily overlooked,

although it has been noticed by Mr. G. Matthey ; hence the analysis of
the substance by the ordinary method of ignition is liable to afford falla-

cious results.

     Nearly 201. has ah-eady been expended, chiefly in the purchase of
platinum and platinum apparatus. The Committee desire to be re-

appointed, with a grant of ,30/., as the experiments are now being extended
to a number of other compounds.

Provisional Report of the Committee, consisting of General Festing,

     Captain Abnet, and Professor H. E. Armstrong {Secretary),
     on the Absorption Spectra of Pure Compounds.

The determination of the spectra of the compounds which the Committee
have fixed upon as essential has been continued, and several have been
measured and classified. The work is very laborious and can only
progress slowly owing to the difficulty of obtaining absolutely pure
compounds, and other difficulties in the photographic method employed
have also arisen. The Committee wish for reappointment to continue the

investigation.

Nineteenth Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Prest-

    AViCH, Dr. H. W. Ckosskey, Professors W. Boyd Dawkins, T.
    McKenny Hughes, and T. (r. Bonney and Messrs. C. E.
     De Eance, W. Pengelly, J. Plant, and K. H, Tiddeman,

     appointed for the purpose of recording the Position, Height
     above the Sea, Lithological Characters, Size, and Origin of
     the Erratic Blochs of England, Wales, and Ireland, reporting
     other matters of interest connected with the same, and taking

     measures for their preservation. (Draivn up by Dr. Crosskey,

       Secretary.)

In their last report the Committee gave some of the general results of

their  survey of  the  erratic  blocks  in the Midland  district  of  England
                                                                                                          ;

they are unable, however, this year still further to address themselves to

the task of giving a scientific arrangement to the vast number of fa^ts
that have been collected in consequence of the number of new facts

which have been reported to them, and which it is necessary to record

before any more systematic generalisations can be attempted.

The destruction of erratics, moreover, is going on so rapidly that

already many of those described in the reports of this Committee have

disappeared, and in a few years these reports will be the chief evidence

of the very existence of a large series of phenomena of great importance

in glacial geology.

     During the past year a N.W. of England Boulder Committee has
been formed, with Mr. C. E. De Ranee, F.G.S., as President and Mr.
Percy F. Kendall, F.G.S., as Secretary, which has already done valuable

work, and promises to accomplish a survey of the erratics of the district
it has undertaken to explore, so thorough, as ultimately to render a
scientific arrangement of the facts possible and enable their meaning to

be understood.

    The Committee have to thank the N.W. of England Boulder Com-

mittee for the following communications, which contain several features

of especial interest :

     (1) The group of boulders reported from Hest Bank (Lancashire) is
of importance. The stones are exclusively such as might have been

derived from the country at present draining into the internal angle of

Morecambe Bay. Account must be taken of this fact in any attempt to

explain their origin.

     (2) The area occupied by drift containing Lake District erratics is
extended and help given towards defining the area of their distribution

on the western slopes of the Pennine chain.

     (3) The remarkable sporadic grouping of large boulders is shown
for example, in the group in the river Tame when taken in connection

with the records of Cheshire groups.

     (4) Evidence is given of the transport and glaciation of local blocks ;
e.g., by the discovery of a large angular block of Ardwick lirdestone at
Haughton Green, the nearest known outcrop of the rock being about

three miles to the N.W., as well as many other angular blocks of the

same limestone.
     (5) The mode of transport of some erratics and their behaviour
        ON THE ERRATIC BLOCKS OF ENGLAND^ ^WALES, AND IRELAND. 277

towards the solid rocks over which they have been carried are illustrated,
the account given of the Levenshnlme group furnishing evidence of ice
in motion.

    Many noteworthy boulders and groups of boulders are also described.

     A group of boulders from Stonyhurst College, near Whalley, Lanca-

shire. Stonyhnrst lies four miles to the west of Whalley Station, at a
height of 360 feet above O.D., on the gentle south-eastern slope of Long-
ridge Fell. The whole district is made up of Yoredale limestones and

shales beautifully exposed on the banks of the river Hodder to the

°°''^|^-63,st, and of the Yoredale grits which form the Longridge Fell and
     the neighbouring hills
all                                                                                                                       ;                                                          and up                                 to  a    considerable                                                                            height the country

is covered with a uniform coat of boulder clay, from which (except when
278 EEPOET-- 1891.

otberwise specified) the erratics in question Lave been extracted.

Glacial striae may be seen on the mountain limestone at various points

some five to six miles to the north-east, near Clitheroe : these stria?, as
shown by the geological survey map, point a few degrees west of south.

    The two rocks which seem to be most abundantly represented among

--the erratics found near Stonyhurst are first, a compact, deep, purplish

red Permian marl, which is slightly exposed four miles to the north-east,

near Clitheroe                                                                   secondly, a  compact  yellow sandstone, very persistently
                                                                              ;

characterised by speckles of brown iron-oxide. I have coupled this rock

with the one first mentioned because I think it likely that it, too, is
Permian or Triassic. The erratics composed of these two rocks all seem

to be of quite small size.

Almost as numerous as the above mentioned, and far exceeding them

in size, are boulders composed of various andesitic rocks, showing a strong

family likeness, perfectly fresh and hard, of a grey colour, slightly varied

in different specimens by greenish and bluish tints. Many of these

measure a full cubic foot or more, and show well all the characters of

ice-borne boulders. Most of them are certainly identical with rocks in

Borrowdale (andesites of the well-known Borrowdale series).

Next, perhaps, in frequency of occurrence come small rounded or

flattened boulders of a fine-grained rose-coloured rock of syenitic aspect.

    Of another rock, also of syenitic aspect, but much larger grained, I

procured a single bouldei", the size of an infant's head, from a field-drain

close to the college.

[Mr. Kendall is of opinion that both of these are varieties of the

Buttermere granophyre.]

   A single piece of a compact, homogeneous pink rhyolite, picked up

within a mile or two of Stonyhurst.

This specimen seems to me certainly identical with a similar pink

rhyolite, composing a remarkable group of large boulders a mile or two
west of Dungeon Ghyll Hotel, near Grasmere, by the side of a broad

path or cart-track leading up the valley to the west from the back of
the hotel. Some of the boulders measured two or three cubic feet.

   A few hundred feet above the college, on the slope of Longridge Pell,

boulders of other than local rocks become very rare ; at a height of 1,10(>

feet, or so, all drift has disappeared, while on the top, at a height of
some 1,300 feet, I have often walked for miles, examining ground, walls,

--and cairn, and have never been able to find a single woi-n pebble or

boulder nothing but angular fragments of the local sandstone. On

Fairsnape Fell, to the north, at about the same height, I have noticed
the same fact.

ALane.  large boulder of Coal-measure sandstone is to be seen having

a group of smaller stones packed in front of it, the whole resting on the

soft purple shales associated with the Ardwick limestone. The large

stone was separated from the underlying Coal-measures by a thin layer

of brownish boulder clay, and (immediately in contact with the boulder)

a film about 3 in. thick of worked-up shale, which was also massed in

front (i.e., to eastward) of it, and formed the nidus of the smallest

stones before mentioned. In this case the evidence was held to be con-

clusive as showing the direction of movement. The packed shale and

fragments of stone were on the easterly side of the large boulder, and the

largest subangular fragment, 2 ft. x 1 ft. 8 in. x 1 ft. 2 in., consisted of

Ardwick limestone of a kind which cropped out 50 yards to the west-

ward. The dimensions of the sandstone boulder are 5 ft. x 4 ft. 3 in.

X 2 ft. 4 in. Long axis about N. 50° W. magnetic. It is scratched upon

all visible faces. The principal scratches upon the upper surface are

from N". 50° "W., i.e., in the direction of the long axis. They clearly

originate at the north-westerly end, and finish at the south-easterly end.

     [A boulder of igneous rock, resembling rocks from the Lake District,
weighing 2^ tons, found in Coronation Street, Reddish, has been described
by Mr. Gray in the ' Annual Report of the Stockport Society of Natu-
ralists,* 1889. It has been removed for preservation to the Vernon
Park.]

     The following reports of erratic blocks and groups of erratic blocks
have been furnished by the Yorkshire Boulder Committee :

   A square block of whinstone. The length is 2 ft. 7 in. by 2 ft. 4 in. by

2 ft. 3 in. above ground. In the parish of Folkton, near Filey, on the

estate of J. Woodall, Esq., Scarborough. The farm is called West Flot-
manby Hall farm. Folkton is situated about five miles to the west of

Filey. West Flotmanby Hall is east of Folkton about half a mile. Ko

striations or marks of any kind, but upon the IST.E. face of the boulder is
the mark of the Government broad arrow. The nearest district from
which it could have travelled is Kildale, in Cleveland, about forty miles
west. About 150 ft. above the sea. Tt is situated nearly on the top of a
ridge of gravel running N.E. by S.W., and rests upon gravel-sand and

beds of clay.

     In the parish of Folkton, on the estate of J. Woodall, Esq., Scar-
borough, round a spring head at the N.E. side of West Flotmanby Hall,
near Filey, there are several boulders which have been collected from the
Carrs ; the largest is

2 ft. 6 in X 1 ft. 11 in. X 1 ft. 3 in. ; Mountain limestone.

and the sandstone from the north-west prolaabl}^ about forty miles dis-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

nearly the same size of lias, and numerous others down to the smallest

sizes. About 130 tons have been carted away for road metal. Generally

rounded, but a few are subangular. All have been moved. Striations in

larger boulders in all directions. They are from all directions and differ-
ent distances, and represent different formations, but many are igneous

or metamorphic.     Say 27 per cent, various 12 per cent, some twenty

cent, pisolite ; 1 per cent, chert ; 1 per cent, chalk flint. Height^

200 ft. above the sea and covering an area of 150 yards X 20 yards.

They are embedded in glacial drift, evidently slightly pervious. Some-

water must have percolated through the clay acting chemically on some

of those most easily thus acted upon. In some cases the iron has been

turned brown, but there has not been a free passage of water through,^

In levelling the road in question in no case have they gone more than

6 ft. deep ; thus all were near the surface.
     Boulder of Shap granite ; measuring 2 ft. 11 in. long, 2 ft. 6 in. broad',

2 ft. 1 in. thick. In the parish of Ganton, near Scarborough, on th-e

estate of Sir C. Legard, Ganton Hall, now forming the coi'ner-stone

on the premises belonging to the Greyhound Inn. Is a large Shap

boulder. It is from subangular to rounded and is oblong in shape.

There are no indications of any striae or grooving. It has been a sort of

trysting stone for generations. An old man remembers when he first

came to the village sixty-two years ago ; this stone was then at the junc-
tion or angle of the road, and from this position anyone could be seen

approaching the village by the highway. It was removed across the-

road to its present position in 1853. It formerly stood at the north

corner of the village lane joining the highway. Height, about 60 ft. above

the sea. The formation on which the boulder rests is composed of beds-

of sand to a great  depth                                   there is occasionally a  band                                   of rough  angular
                                                         ;

flint intermixed, but generally speaking the whole district about here is-

a huge sand-bed.

At the west end of the same house are two boulders measuring

       2 ft. 6 in. X 1 ft. 4 in. X 1 ft. 3 in. ; Whinstone.
       1 ft. 3 in. X 1 ft. 2 in. X 1 ft. in. ; Oolitic sandstone.

The one composed of whinstone is angular, the Oolitic sandstone subangu-
lar. Both have been moved to their present position. The sandstone
may have come across the valley about six miles north. Height above
the sea, about 60 ft.

     Boulder of grey granite ; length, 3 ft. 8 in., 1 ft. 8 in. broad,
1 ft. 6 in. thick, occurs in the parish of Lund, at the north end of the
village of Lund, near Beverley, East Riding of Yorkshire, and about 150
yards to the north of Lund Church. Subangular. There is no doubt but
ON THE ERRATIC BLOCKS OF ENGLAND, WALES, AND IRELAND. 297

that this boulder has been removed to its present position, although a long

time ago. No strife or markings. Probably the nearest source would be

about 200 miles north. Height, about 150 ft. above the sea.

In the parish of Lund, at the north end of the village, pi'incipally

in the village street, at the north side of the church, there are about

100 boulders, which are to be seen in the footpaths, foundations of

old houses, banks of the road, &c. : these are composed of whinstone,

diorite, hard compact sandstone, and granite, but the majority are whin-

stone. The largest is about 2 ft. long, 14 in. broad, and 9 in. thick ; the

smallest is about 9 in. thick, 8 in, broad, 7 iu. deep. Besides these are

several hundreds not more than 6 in. by 6 in. by 6 in., which have been

nsed for paving footpaths. They are all rounded to subangular. The

whole have been moved to their present position. The nearest rock of

the same nature would be about Cleveland in the north probably 100
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

miles north. Height, about 150 ft. above the sea. Boulders, more or less

small, of all sorts of foreign rocks are being continually cleared off the land

about here, and broken up for roads. There seems to be only a thin

covering of boulder clay in some parts, and underneath a great thickness

of rounded chalk gravel with flints, &c.

Second Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. H. Woodward

     (Chairman), Rev. Gr. F. Whidborne, Messrs. E. Etheridge, E.

    KiDSTON, J. E. Marr, C. D. Sherborn, and A. S. Woodward

     (Secretary), for the Registration of all the Type Spechnens of

      British Fossils.

The Committee Imve to report that, after some preliminary delay, copies
of the circular and letter mentioned last year have been issued to the
majority of the British museums and owners of private geological collec-
tions, and several valuable lists have already been received. It is pro-
posed to complete the distribution of the forms immediately, and there is
thus some hope that the majority of the lists may be available for

classification before the next meeting of the Association, In the opinion
of the Committee it is inadvisable to attempt a detailed report until some

such classification has been made ; and it has been decided to append to
300 REroRT-- 1891.

the list of types an enumeration of the principal specimens which have

been described and figured.

     Owing to the influence to some extent of members of the Committee,

it is gratifying to be able io state that several of the larger museums

have decided to publish separate lists of the type and figured specimens

in their respective collections. Those of Bristol (by Mr. Edward Wilson)

and  York                                            (by Mr.  H.  M.  Platnauer)  are  already published                                                                                                           while  those
                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

of Bath (by Rev. H. H. Winwood and Mr. E. Wilson) and Cambridge

(by Mr. H. Woods) are nearly ready for issue. Separate lists are also

promised for the Museums of Edinburgh, Newcastle-on-Tyne, and

Brighton                                             and it is hoped  that  a  catalogue  of  type                                                                                                                 specimens of fossil
                                                  ;

Invertebrata in the British Museum will shortly be prepared. So far as

the British fossil Vertebrata are concerned, Messrs. Woodward and

Sherborn's catalogue (London, 1890) contains a nearly complete enumera-

tion of the types.

    able Formations of England and Wales, and the Quantity and

     Character of the Water supplied to various Towns and Dis-
    tricts from these Formations. (Draivn up by C. E. De Eance,

      Reporter.)

Eighteen years have elapsed since your Committee were appointed

with their present Chairman and Secretary in their respective positions
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

since then your Committee have not only recorded the wells and borings

already in existence, but they have annually given much information to

engineers and contractors, which they believe have materially aided

towns and districts being supplied with pure water. The value and

importance of underground water, both from its purity and the absence

of expensive law costs and compensation to ri])arian owners, are daily

more and more realised, and with the utilisation of these stores comes

the necessity of recording their character, quality, and local conditions.
Tour Committee, therefore, seek re-election.

Tour Committee would again call the attention of the Delegates of

the Correspondiog Societies to the importance of local observers giving

special attention to the date at which the springs of their neigh-

bourhood diminish in yield                                            and subsequently increase                                                                                                                    the date at which
                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

any springs cease to flow, and that on which they recommence ; the

amount of flow of any springs either daily, weekly, or monthly ; similar

records of the heights of the water in wells and borings, whether for long

or short periods. The value of such observations would be much en-

hanced if descriptions be given that will enable the locality to be identi-

fied on the one-inch map of the Ordnance Survey and the levels in regard

to the Ordnance Datum line.

A plentiful supply of water was met witb, of a pure character, but

unfortunately strongly impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen gas,
which was freely given off when the water was agitated. It is worthy
of note that sulphur springs occur at various points along the anticlinal
axis ranging through this boring ; amongst them is the sulphur well or
Craven Baths, at Skipton, on the opposite side of the valley, and the
well-known sulphur springs of Harrogate to the east ; while to the west
of Clitheroe one occurs at Standen Brook, to which a bath-house is
attached, also south of Worsaw, in Twist's Brook, in Holden Brook, and
in the bed of the river Hodder, north of Longridge Fell. The Skipton
boring commences 340 feet above the mean sea-level ; the sulphur bath is
at 420 feet above the same ; the shale and thin bedded limestones there

are vertical.

The discharge from springs in the Lincoln area has been taken by

the City Engineer at various points at Tealby on the Wolds. The

discharge on May 25, 1891, was 109,440 gallons per day. At Welton

these springs yielded 2,800,000 gallons on June 22, 18yl ; in August

1878 they only yielded 105,000 gallons ; and in June, 1887, 163,000 per

24 hours, proving the extreme variability of oolitic springs. The maxi-

mum discharge was' after a rainfall of five inches in the previous five

Aweeks.     boreJiole,at Deneholme, 106 feet in depth, yielded 20,000

gallons per 24 hours ^ its height and quantity were affected by rainfall.

    In the shafts and borings made at Kirkstead and Woodhall, near
Horncastle, in 1819, in a futile search for coal, no water appears to have
been met with, except the saline spring, now known as Woodhall Spa,
which occurred at a depth of 530 feet, and is believed by Mr. Jukes-

Browne, of the Geological Survey, to have issued from the inferior oolite.

He thinks it probable that the beds passed through were as follows :

     At Stamford, the Marquis of Exeter had a futile boring for coal put
down which commenced in the Kimeridge clay, and was discontinued at
500 feet still in the lias, as might have been anticipated.

follows ; water had been admitted to the beds, between the completion of
the borings and the execution of the shafts, by the withdrawal of the
lining tubes of the bore-holes. The case is of great interest as showing
the care that must be exercised in dealing with borings not to induce

The reporter has, during the last year, carefully and continuously
investigated all new sections of the rocks of the Neapolitan area. The
gi'eat main sewer which is in course of construction, as mentioned in the

last report, crosses the whole of the volcaTiic district to the west of

Naples and terminates near the Monte di Cuma in the Gulf of Gaeta.

This tunnel, of considerable section, is about 20 kilometres in length,

and is being constructed from nineteen points of attack. In many places
the materials traversed are of a very friable nature, and consequently the
masonry lining progresses with the cutting. It will be therefore seen
that most careful and constant attention and frequent visits are necessary
for keeping a record of the geology. Most of this tunnel is through
rocks at a high temperature, so that numerous thermometric observations
were made. So far most of the different portions are not yet joined, and
therefore any description would be very incomplete if given in this

report ; it is therefore proposed to postpone it till the next meeting of
the British Association. Sevei'al observations, however, of considerable
importance as bearing on this district as well as on vulcanological
phenomena in general, have come to light.

     For upwards of a year the remaining portion of the reporter's spare
time has been spent in the compilation of the bibliography of Vesuvius
and the Phlegroean fields, as well as of the other volcanoes of Southern

Italy. In this he has had the able co-operation of his wife, Madame
Antonia Lavis. This long, tedious, but very necessary work is now

complete, and the reporter hopes to present a copy to the Association.

To show the amount of toil necessary, it may be mentioned that the
number of entries have been more than double those published in the

Report of the International Geological Congress of 1881.

ON THE VOLCANIC PHENOMENA OF VESUVItJS,  313

     The reporter has much gratification in presentinor to the Association
the great geological map of Monte Somma and Vesuvius, which has
been now pubHshed some months, and in the construction of which
much substantial help, and above all moral encouragement, has been
given by the British Association. The reporter hopes that his colleagues

in the science of geology will be satisfied that he has done his utmost to

v/in their confidence.

     During the latter part of 1890 and the early part of 1891, the central
activity of Vesuvius has very slightly varied, except about the new year,
when it was considerably increased, rising to the third or fourth degree,
simultaneously with the stoppage of the lateral outflow of lava that had
been going on since August 7, 1890. Since then, up to the present

outburst, the central activity has been generally at the first degree, and
the cone of eruption has slowly grown in height (see Plate).

    On June 1 there was a crater within the central cone of eruption, of

about 50 m. in diameter, near the centre of which was the eruptive vent,

surrounded by another embryonic eruptive cone. On that day, four

small eruptive mouths opened around the embryonic cone in the bottom

of the central crater, the smallest being to the east.

     Thus the volcano remained till June 7, at 10 a.m., when activity

stopped, only a small quantity of vapour escaping from central vents.
At midday a radial cleft opened at the north toe of the cone of eruption
(May 1889, June 1891), traversing towards its east end the little sickle-
shaped ridge, the remnant of the 1885-86 crater, but, as yet, gave out
little vapour. At 4 to 4.30 p.m., shocks of earthquake commenced,
limited only to the upper slopes of Vesuvius, and sinanltaneous with the

extension of the radial fissure down the side of the great Vesuvian cone
for nearly half its way opposite the Punta del Nasone of Monte Somma,

fiom which, at about 5.30 p.m., issued a little lava, whilst from the npper
extremity of the fissure at the toe of the cone of eruption much
vapour escaped, so that as seen from Naples the smoke-plume arose from
this point. From 5.30 to 7 p.m. the fissure still extended lower, accom-

panied from time to time by local earthquakes, noises, and the elevation
of columns of black dusty smoke. At a few minutes to 7 the floor of the
Atrio del Cavallo was reached, and a remarkably black column of smoke

had arisen.

    My friend Dr. L. Sambon saw this nolumn arise, and came to inform

me immediately, as I had left off watching the mountain at 5.30. After
photographing the mountain, we left Naples at 9 p.m., and spent some

time in inquiries at Resina and near the Obsei'vatory. Everything was
now dark, as the volcano had calmed down at 8 p.m. At 2 a.m., June 8,
we were at the eastern extremity of the Observatory ridge, and com-
menced to wend our way across the lava sui'face towards Monte Somma.

We were at the lowest part of the depression at the west end of the

Atrio del Cavallo, where it joins the Fossa della Vetrana, and along
which some of the largest lava-streams have flowed (1855, 1872, &c.),
when suddenly on our right above us (2.23 a.m.) a vast quantitj^ of

bright red vapour arose from the new outpour of lava. We hastened

our steps as much as the road and our lantern would allow us, so as to
reach the escarpment of Monte Somma, the foot of which was followed
till near the Punta del Nasone, and close to the theatre of eruption.
Here we clambered up some distance above the level of the Atrio to
watch events whilst we ate our late supper or early breakfast. Along

the slope of the great cone in the line of fissure were a few luminous
points from some pieces of still uncooled lava of the little that had oozed
forth from the lower half of the tissure. At about 60 or 80 yards from
the foot of the great cone two or three fountains of lava were throwing
up jets of molten rock for 2 or 3 m., and the lava was slowly spreading
out on the almost horizontal plain of the Atrio in several tongues. The
lava must have still been high in the main chimney, as the vapour that
issued at the top of the fissure showed a slightly red illumination. So

we remained till daylight, when we could see the fissure on the side of

the cone. The mouth that formed at 5.30 the previous day was still

smoking a little, whilst the fissure below it sent off several ramifications

at an acute angle like the branches of an inverted tree, from several of

which little streams of lava had been given out, where they had soon

Weconsolidated (see fig. 1).  now followed the base of the great cone

to the lower railway station, where we found all the people up and

with the fresh outflow of lava that we had witnessed, but which shocks

we bad not felt, altbougli tbey were described as the most seyere that

had been felt.
    Having ascended to the summit of Vesuvius, we found the central

crater rapidly enlarging by tbe falling in of its edges. From tbe new
fissure at its summit was issuing much vapour under pressure, and rich

in sulphurous acid, wbich is, even in traces, intolerable ; and the hot air

coming from innumerable new fi.ssnres rendered approach very difficult.

We did, in fact, once jump across part of the fissure, but retuined much

quicker on account of the hot irritant vapours. An approach from the

opposite side was equally unsuccessful. At some old f umaroles on tbe

1872 crater plain I collected some crusts of boric acid and alum, both

rare products at this volcano.

    I then wrote that one of three terminations we may expect to these

pbenomena, which are very characteristic of a lateral disruption, so

common at Vesuvius ' :
     1. Should the lava cool sufBciently to plug the radial dyke, no further

phenomena will occur, and activity will be restored to the central vent.
    2. If this plugging only partially takes place, lava may dribble forth

for months, but probably the escape of vapour will soon be restored to

the central vent.

    3. If the rent should widen, considering how low it extends, we may

expect a grand eruption wbich might rival that of 1872, which com-

menced  near the  same  spot and  much  in  tbe  same  way                        the  mechanism
                                                                               ;

by which this occurs I have explained elsewhere. ^

     The suggestion that I published in several newspapers has been fully

--confirmed namely, that the second alternative type of eruptive character

Avould be pursued by the volcano. Now, for a period of nearly two

months lava has continued to dribble forth, activity has returned to the

central vent, and no great changes have occurred.
     The throat of the volcano commenced to be cleared on June 9, the

vapour forcing its way up from the crater bottom through the choke of
loose materials, and rose above as a column carrying with it much dust;
at the same time the powerful vapour blast issuing from the upper
extremity of the lateral rift soon stopped. Each day I was kept informed
of the state of the volcano by the kindness of Messrs. Ferber and Treiber,

the director and engineer respectively of the Vesuvian Railway.

    On June 15 1 considered it right to again visit the mountain, and had
the good fortune to be accompanied by Messrs. H. Elliot, A. Green,
Linden, Newstead, and Treiber, several of whom are excellent photo-
graphers, so that with two of my own cameras we were able to make an

extensive pictorial record of some very nnique formations.
     At the point of issue of the lava, at the junction of the foot of the

great Vesuvian cone and the Atrlo del Cavallo, the first lava had cooled
Bufficiently to walk over it, but beneath our feet could still be seen in a
few holes the flowing lava. At the foot of the great cone, and extending

for half-way across the Atrio, along the radius of the eruptive rent, as if

Wethis had continued so far, were a series of driblet cone fumaroles.

abortive ones. Most were giving out intensely Leated vapour, which was
liberated from the lava flowing beneath, and which soon carbonised a
piece of wood placed in it. Ai-ound the lips of the upper opening,

hsRmatite with fused chlorides of potash, soda, iron, copper, &c., were

being condensed from the vapour, and trickling down the outer surface

of the fumarole, consolidated as curious vari-coloured stalactites of verj;j
deliquescent nature.

     The lava liad first flowed towards the escarpment of Monte Somraa in
a fan like manner, so that the eastern extremity reached that prreat
natural section just beneath the Punta del Nasone Still following the
natural inclination of the ground, it turned to the west, and on June 15

was opposite dyke 16 (as marked on my large geological map just pub-

lished, and on the dykes themselves), advancing at a very slow rate.
     The lava is a vitreous and coarse-grained rock, especially in regard to

the included leucite as well as augite crystals, whilst the surfacs is, with
one exceptional tongue, of the corded or ' pahoehoe ' type. This is due
to the magraa being one that has been simmering since January in the
chimney ot the volcano, so that most of its dissolved water has been boiled
off, and so allowing^ it to cool without the formation of scorite from the

vapour that otherwise would escape after its exit. Leucite I have also

demonstrated to be formed while the magma is simmering under low

pressure with free escape for vapour in the upper part of the volcanic
chimney.'

     At the summit of the great cone the crumbling in of the edges was
constantly going on, but the upper extremity of the lateral rift at the foot
of the cone of eruption and at the summit of the great Vesuvian cone had
nearly ceased to give forth vapour. Along the line of rent on the
mountain side no fumaroles or other signs of activity were visible except
quite at the foot, where those of which I have spoken commence.

    Up till June 26 there was an effort to clear the upper part of the

 volcanic chimney of the impeding materials, which were constantly beinof
 added to by the slips from the crater's edge ; but ou that eveninfr a dull
 I'ed glow was visible in the crater bottom, showing that a fairly clear
 passage had been temporarily made for the continuous escape of vapour,
 and also that the lava was at no very great depth from the summit of the
 volcano. This of course indicates that the lateral opening was insufBcient
 to drain off much of the lava which occupies the chimney above the level

 of the lateral outlet. Had such evacuation really taken place the eruption
 would have assumed enormous proportions, from the actual amount of

 lava above the tap, but more from frothing up of lava below that level, in
 consequence of the relief of pressure which in that case would occur. Of
 course, during all these days the ejection of dust with the smoke occurred,
 giving the latter its peculiar dark grey colour. Further destruction of
 the crater edge took place, so as to partly block the outlet, and it was not
 till our next visit that it again cleared.

     On June 30 I again visited the crater, accompanied by my friend

 Mr. A. Green. All the summit of the great cone was covered by a thick
 coating of dust and sand, upon the surface of which were the usual white
 and yellowish-green chloride crusts seen on such occasions, so rich in
 copper as to plate with that metal the iron nails of our boots. The crater
 had considerably enlarged, the edges were in an extremely unstable state,
with often considerable strips marked off by cracks parallel to the free
edge, so that with a slight push by a stick it was possible to detach large
 masses of the materials which form the sides of the crater in the recent
cone of eruption. So dangerous were the edges that it was but two

places that my experience indicated as being safe to approach and look

over, and that even with several precautions; so that the fatal accident
to Senor Silva Jardim, who lost his life here but a few hours after our
departure, is not to be wondered at.

     On looking down some 45 to 50 m. beneath us, we could see the glow

from a month some 2 or 3 m. in diameter. The walls of the crater were
concave, so that, although overhanging at the top, yet a plumb-line let
fall from the edge would strike the bottom of the cliff. The crater
bottom was roughly plain, due to the combination of a talus all round,
and an attempt at a cone encircling the main vent. It will be thus seen
that the crater cavity was of the form of a convex-sided cylinder, or more
simply barrel-shaped, with its upper diameter some 50 to 55 m.

     With much difhculty we made our way around to the north side of
the cone of eruption, which did not show its usual loose scoriaa surface,
as it was buried beneath a thick coat of sand and dust, covered with a
thin saline crust on its surface. The upper limit of the radial rift, which
we were prevented from examining three weeks previously, on account
of its giving out so much vapour as to constitute the temporary escape
aperture of the volcano, had now become quiescent, so that we could
fully examine it. Only a current of hot air was now issuing from it, but
1 was able to collect some fine masses of crystallised molysite and
kremersite from its edges. Its average breadth was about 0'50 m. where
it traversed old compact lava, but of course it disappeared as soon as it
reached the looser materials. The real azimuth of its orientation, which
we could now determine with greater accuracy than when we were
walking over hot rock and enveloped in hot irritating vapours, proves to
be, as it radiates away from the axis of Vesuvius, about 15° west of

north. It curves then a little to the north, and near the foot of the

ereab cone it again assumes nearly the same azimuth as at starting, an
arrano'emeut winch is quite evident when the Vesuvian cone is regarded
from the Punta del Nasone. From that, the highest point of Somma,
the lower extremity of the rift lies a little to the right or west, and faces
that part of the Sonima ridge which corresponds to the upper extremity

of the Vallone Cancherone.

material of these eraptions, and consists of the pulverised components of

    Having passed the night at the lower railway station, the next day we

crossed the Atrio, ascended to the western extremity of the ridge of
Somma, and followed it along so as to get a general bird's-eye view of
the whole scene of the eruption, and take photographs of the more

important points. As one stands on the Punta del Nasone and embi-acea

that magnificent view of VesuTius and the Atrio del Cavallo, one sees

below the new lava-stream in the form of the letter La, the horizontal
portion of which is still being prolonged down the Atrio towards the

Fossa della Vetrana. In the middle of the rilge we found a thin coating

of fine red dust which had reached thus far from the crater. Much of

the Atrio was also covered by the same material. Scaling the cliff face

just beyond the Cognulo di Ottajano to the Atrio del Cavallo, we again

visited the lower point of the outburst. Most of the beautiful fumaroles

were in a state of ruin, and lined by good-sized crystals of liEeraatite and

mixed chloride crusts. Here the lava was quite solid, though at one

point was a hole, some 50 m. from the base of the great cone, where we

could see the molten rock flowing lazily along about a metre beneath our

feet. The lava at the end of the flow was making considerable progress

to the westwards, and stood opposite dyke 13.

     During the month of July few changes took place in the mountain
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

the crater still got larger, dust was thrown out, and the lava descended.

These phenomena are capable of continuing for months if the drainage

opening does not enlarge.

After an interval of a month, during which by the kindness of Messrs.

Treiber and Ferber I was kept continuously informed of any change, I

again visited the volcano. The crater had considerably enlarged, but

chiefly in a south-easterly direction, in the line of the fi.ssures that have

existed for a long time at the edge of the crater plain and the top of the

great cone. These fissures had also increased in size and number since

my last visit, so that altogether this seems to be, at present, the most

favoured direction for the next disruption of the great cone. The crater

has therefore an irregular oval form, with the major axis directed

N.W.-S.E. Ou this occasion I could not see the bottom of the crater,

but on its walls were several dykes, which may be enumerated according

--to their orientation: N.E. ; N. ; N.N.E., probably the dyke of the last

eruption                                                 N.W. ;  S.W., probably  the  upper part  of the  fissure i below

and a little solid dyke close to it. There may have been others, but the

perilous nature of the crater edge requiring great care, even in the only

two places one could approach, together with the abundant irritating

vapour, prevented a careful examination.

The lava, which had at one time extended down to nearly opposite

Messrs. Cook's gate-lodge in the Fossa Vetrana, was now flowing very

slowly at the junction of the Fossa and the Atrio del Cavallo.

   A few days previously four shocks of earthquake occurred, limited to

the great cone and felt at the lower railway station. These, combined

with the other phenomena above mentioned, show that the cone is in an

exti'emely un>;table state, and want of confidence must be felt until some

time fui'ther has elapsed.

     In conclusion, the reporter must thank Mr. G. M. Cook, of Messrs.

Cook, Son & Co., for granting free passage over the Vesuvian Railway,

thus greatly facilitating the investigation of the volcanic phenomena.

Second Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor James
     Geikie (Chairman), Dr. Tempest Axdeksox, Dr. Valentine

     Ball, Mr. James E. Bedford, Professor T. G. Bonney, Professor

    W. Boyd Dawkins, Mr. James W. Davis, Mr. William Gray,

     Mr. Egbert Kidston, Mr. Arthur S. Keid, Mr. E. H. Tiddeman,
    Mr, W. W. Watts, Mr, Horace B. Woodward, and Mr. Osmund

    W. Jeffs {Secretary), to arrange for the collection, preservation,
    and systematic registration of Photographs of Geological In-
    terest in the United Kingdom. {Drawn up by the Secretary.)

Your Comraittee beg to report that during the past year the work of

collecting photographs illustrating the geological features of our country

has been continued, with the result that 313 additional photographs have

been received and registered, making a total up to the month of August of

588. A detailed list of these additional photographs is appended herewith.

At the Leeds meeting of the Association upwards of 200 photographs were

arranged for exhibition in the room appointed for the use of Section C,

many of which illustrated sections of strata and other geological features

of considerable scientific interest. This collection attracted much atten-

tion, and it is proposed to continue the exhibition at Card ifi" if convenient

arrangements can be made. By this means the Committee hope to

secure the aid of many photographers, who can thus form a better idea

of the kind of subjects which it is desirable to include in the collection of

geological views.

Special efforts have been made to induce the local societies in each,

county to organise systematic surveys for the furtherance of the work.

This method has been pursued with great success in Yorkshire, the mem-

bers of the Geological Photographic Committee of the Yorkshire Natural-

ists' Union having again contributed a large and valuable series of prints.

Many of these subjects refer to sections which cannot be reproduced, as,

for instance, fossil trees laid bare in quarrying and excavations for the

foundations of buildings now covered over.

The Hertfordshire Natural History Society and the East Kent Natural

History Society have also organised schemes for the photography of local

geological features, and some views have been sent in from these sources,

which, it is hoped, will be supplemented by a further series next year.

In the case of some local societies difficulties have arisen, which hav&

delayed the completion of similar arrangements proposed to have been

made. It is not always possible to obtain the services of a photographer

when desired, and it has been found difficult to arouse the interest of many

of the local photographic societies in geological work. Considering the

number of amateur photographers now to be met with in every centre of

scientific energy, it is hoped that a large number of photographers will be

induced in the future to co-operate with the local scientific societies in
the scheme instituted by the Committee. The numerous field-meetings

and scientific excursions, now so popular a part of the work of such societies,
would appear to afford convenient opportunities for aiding our scheme,

if arrangements could be made for a photographer to accompany the

party whenever the district to be visited offered suitable subiects for the
                                               -^

use of the camera. Bat it is very desirable that the work should be pur-

Asued systematically in every county.                                   list should be drawn up by the

officers of the local societies, giving the localities of new sections opened,

besides particulars of old sections and other features worthy of reproduc-

tion and peiTaanent pictorial record. Several photographers have inti-

mated their willingness to assist the Committee in this way, if they were

informed of the localities of which photographs are desired. The Com-

mittee would be glad to receive from geologists generally such particulars,

which would be duly noted, and endeavours would be made to secure

photographs when opportunity offered.

For the information of photographers, the following lists of desiderata

are given :

                                                           Per Professor James Geikie, EdinburgJi.

shire.

    Current bedded sandstones at Dingle Point on north bank of the Mersey.
     OutcroiJ of coal seams at Doulton quarry, St. Helen's.

These lists are, of course, capable of being largely extended, and are

inserted simply as examples of what is required.

While the actual number of new photographs sent in for registration

during the year does not greatly exceed the number acknowledged in the

last report, it is gratifying to state that, as a whole, the subjects have

been selected with greater care to include the most typical views. It has

not been wished to restrict too greatly the definition of what is a 'geo-

logical photograph.' Views illustrating types of landscape scenery are

often extremely useful, though not perhaps enforcing any particular

--geological feature. These will be simply described as : ' Landscape
Silurian '                                            or,  ' Landscape  Bunter Sandstone,' &c., as the case may be.
                                                   ;

But, as the collection grows in numbers, it will be more convenient to

confine it to views which are especially typical and characteristic. For

the guidance of amateur photographers and others who might not be able

always to refer to a geological authority, the following explanatory para-

graph was inserted in the circular of instructions issued by the Com-

mittee :

     Photographs are desired illustrative of characteristic rock-sections, especially
thos3 of a tjpicil character or temporary nature; important boulders; locahties

characteristic river-valleys or escarpments, and the like glacial phenomena, such as
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

roches montonnces, moraines, drums and kames, or any natural views of geological

interest. Photographs of microscopical sections, and typical hand-specimens of rocks

are also admissible.

     Your Committee held a meeting at Leeds and discussed several details
of the work, which has been principally carried out through the medium

of correspondence.

     Regarding the question of the disposal of the photographs, it was
decided to defer any recommendation on the subject until the collection
was in a more complete form.

     Reference was made in the last report to a proposed publication of a
series of the best photographs received by the Committee, reproduced
by a permanent process. The suggestion has received the careful
consideration of the Committee. It was decided, however, to defer the
subject until the next meeting of the Association, when, if any arrange-
ments with a publisher could be made, the Committee would probably be
in a position to select a series of approved photographs for the purpose
of authorising their reproduction, with the consent of the owners of the

negatives.

    A desire having been widely expressed for facilities by which lantern slides

of the geological photographs included in the list issued could be procured, the

Secretary was instructed to endeavour to make arrangements to effect this
object. Owing to the fact of the negatives not being in the possession of
the Committee, the privilege of supplying lantern slides remaias in the hands

of the various photographers. In the case of professional photographers,

there is usually no difficulty in supplying these to teachers and others

who may require them. Negatives taken by private persons are not un-
frequently handed over to a professional photographer, who has authority

to supply slides to the public. Applications for slides should, therefore,

as in the case of ordinary prints, be made to the photographer direct, whose
address is, whenever known, printed at the head of each local list, or else
to the local society under whose auspices the photographs were taken.
In order to meet the convenience of amateurs who do not make their own
slides, but who would be willing to lend their negatives for the purpose
of having slides made, the Secretary has effected an arrangement with an
experienced photographer, who will landertake to supply lantern slides, at
a tixed price, from negatives with which he may be temporarily entrusted.

It is understood that this arrangement only applies to those cases in which
the owner of the negative does not desire to supply them himself. Future

lists will contain the needful particulars as to obtaining lantern slides ; in
the meantime persons desiring to avail themselves of the arrangement

above mentioned may communicate with the Secretary.
     Your Committee are pleased to observe the spread of geological photo-

graphic schemes in countries abroad. The Societe Geologique de Belgique
have, on the recommendation of M. G. Dewalque, adopted a form similar
to that of form 'A' issued by your Committee for recording the details and
registering the numbers of photographs contributed to their own collec-
tion, and a copy of this schedule is inserted in the ' Bulletin ' of the Society

for July, 1890.

     The Geological Society of America have also appointed a Committee
on Photographs, which has already made good progress, nearly 300

                                                                                                                              Y2

examples having been exliibited at the Washington meeting of this
Society in December, 1890. The American Committee purpose preparing

some lists for international exchange.

    A paper by Mr. Arthur S. Reid, M.A., F.G.S., appeared in the

' Photographic Quarterly ' for January, 1891, in which the author advo-
cated the use of the hand camera in the field, and subsequent enlargements

on bromide paper to whole plate size.
     In order to proceed with the collection of geological photographs and

bring the scheme to a more complete stage, your Committee respectfully

request reappointment and a renewal of the grant.

       SECOND LIST OF GEOLOGICAL PHOTOGRAPHS.

                                                 (to august, 1891.)

  --Note. This list contains the subjects of geological photographs,,

copies of which have been received by the Secretary of the Committee
since the publication of the last report. Photographers are asked ta
affix the registered numbers, as given below, to their negatives, for
convenience of future reference.

     Copies of any photographs desired can, in most instances, be obtained
either from the photographer direct or from the ofBcers of the local
society under whose auspices the views were taken.

     The Committee in no case has assumed the copyright of photographs
registered, which is presumed to be held by the photographer.

    The price at which copies of photographs may be obtained depends
upon the size of the print and local circumstances, over which the

Committee has no control.

 334 REPORT-- 1891.

 Repo7't of the Committee, consisting of Dr. H. Woodward {Chair-
      man), Messrs. W. D. Crick, T. Gt. G-eorge, Wm. Hull, E. A.
      Walford, E. Wilson, H. B. Woodward, and Beeby Thompson
      {Secretary), to luorh the very Fossiliferous Transition Bed be-
      tiveen the Middle and Upper Lias in Northamptonshire, in
      order to obtain a more clear idea of its fauna, and to fix the
      position of certain sp)ecies of fossil fish, and more fully investi-
      gate the horizon on which they occur. {Drawn up by the

        Secretary.)

 In 1863 Mr. E. C. H. Day published in the ' Journal of the Geological
 Society ' a paper entitled ' On the Middle and Upper Lias of the Dorset-
 shire Coast.' In this paper, page 293 of the Journal, Mr. Day describes
 ' The Marlstone "with its Plenrotomaria Bed.' From this description it

 appears that the marlstone rock bed is capped by a remarkable bed of
 small thickness, abounding in gasteropods and other fossils, which indicate

-- --particularly the ammonites a passage bed between the Middle and

 Upper Lias. Mr. Day considers that the Fish bed of Ilminster and
 Dumbleton is absent.

      In 1865-66 Mr. Charles Moore published, in the ' Proceedings of the
 Somersetshire Archreological and Natural History Society,' a long paper

 ' On the Middle and Upper Lias of the South-West of England,' in which

 he describes a zone situated between the Marlstone and Fish bed under
 the name of the Leptcp.na beds.

      In 1872 Mr. Thos. Beesley read a paper before the Warwickshire

ANaturalists and Archaeologists' Field Club entitled ' Sketch of the

 Geology of the Neighbourhood of Banbury,' in which mention was made
 oi. a passage bed between the Middle and Upper Lias. This paper was

 published in the ' Proceedings ' of the Society.
      In 1876 Messrs. Tate and Blake published their ' Yorkshire Lias,'

in which they described a zone of the Middle Lias, under the name of
 the Zo7ie of Amvwuites Annidatus, occupying the position of the Pleuro-
  omaria bed of Day and the Lepttena beds of Moore.

     Again, in 1879 Mr. Edwin A. Walford published in the ' Proceedings
of the Warwickshire Naturalists and Archajologists' Field Club ' a paper
' On Some Middle and Upper Lias Beds in the Neighbourhood of Ban-
bury.' This paper describes a bed situated between the ]\Iailstone rock
bed and the Upper Lias Fish bed, in the south-western parts of North-
amptonshire, under the name of the Transition bed.

   --Some few years ago two of the members of this committee Messrs.
--Thompson and Crick detected the same bed in a rather large number of

widely separated parts of Northamptonshire, and as far north as Tilton,

in Leicestershire.'

     As it seemed of considerable interest to more thoroughly investigate
this bed and those immediately above and below it, and there was much
difficulty in doing so owing to nearly all the Marlstone quarries being
closed, the British Association kindly made a grant of money for the
purpose. The present report gives the results of the investigation.

     ' Mr. E. Wilson had previously described the deposits at Tilton, but did nots
separate the Transition bed from the rock bed.
ON THE FOSSILIFEKOUS THANSITION BED IN NORTHAMPIONSHIEE. 335

    By the date of delivering the report, July 25, it has not been possible

to thoroughly investigate all the material collected, but if anything furtlier

of interest is found a supplementary report will be presented in 1892.

   We particularly desire to thank Mr. S. S. Buckman, F.G.S., for

examining and reporting on the ammonites, and Mr. E. Wilson, F.G.S.,

the gasteropods.

                            Situation of Sections.

The sections that have been opened are situated respectively at Milton,

about 3 miles S.S.W. of Northampton ; at Bugbrook, about 4 miles almost

due west from    the  last  named                                   near  to  Arbury     Hill,  and at    Catesby,
                                                                 ;

about 8 miles further westward ; and at Chipping Warden, about 6^

miles S.S.W. of the Arbury Hill one.

The list of fossils contains some collected over a rather wider area

and extending northwards as far as Watford (on the railway), 7^ miles

N.E. of Catesby.

It will be noticed, therefore, that the investigation embraces places

situated 14 miles apart from N.E. to S.W., and about 12 miles at right

angles to this.

' Spinatus ' zone. M. Marlstone rock bed

    In regard to the above section we may say that there is no exposure

giving the full sequence, and that where the upper beds are shown
the lower ones may differ somewhat from this, and vice versa.

    With regard to B and F the evidence is about equally balanced as to

whether they should go with the ' Serpentinns ' beds or the Fish beds,

and so we prefer at present to leave it undecided. They may be I'egarded

as constituting a transitional zone.

     The first section was opened in the spring of 1890 at Milton, about
S miles S.S.W. of Northampton, but owing to the delay in procuring

permission, and other difBcuities experienced, that was the only one that
could be opened that year. In some respects, however, this was the
most interesting section examined. It has the advantage of being further
eastward than any other section exposing the same beds, and, as has
been pointed out elsewhere,' the beds seem to vary more at right angles
to the line of strike than they do along it.

     The section jusfc described was opened at what appeared to be the
most convenient spot ; it was the site of an old brickyard worked many-
years ago, and was left in a most convenient condition for reopening, but
as the results were somewhat disappointing, the Rev. J. Harrison kindly
gave us permission to make a section at the old Dryhurst pit, about a
mile further eastward, where the very fine fish Lepidotus gigas, now in the
British Museum, is said to have been obtained.' The depth of the Fish
bed at this spot made it impossible to work it without considerable
expense, as it exceeded 10 feet, and there was no open face to commence
at. The section made, however, shows the development of some of the
higher beds better than any other now to be seen in the district, and we
were able to get at the lower beds nearer the surface some half-mile
away. Thus the three sections in this neighbourhood enable us to get a
very much better idea of the character and succession of the beds than
we had before.

half-mile away, and is almost exactly like that at the bottom of the fii-st

softer and more distinctly shown, and the Fish bed is more nodular, and
apparently more fossiliferous. It does not appear necessary to give a
separate section and list of fossils.

     The next section opened was near to Arbury Hill, about 13 miles
almost due east from Northampton. In this neighbourhood the rock bed

is very near to the surface.

     Fortunately a similar section was opened at Catesby about the same
time, and worked for about a week for road metal. This gave us an
opportunity of examining the rock led of that district. The section
itself above the rock bed is so similar to the one at Arbury Hill that
it would be mere i-epetition to give it.

It will be noticed that tbe last two sections, Arbury and Catesby, differ

greatly from the more easterly ones. The Fish bed is totally different in

appearance and composition, and has developed into a Cephalopoda bed.

There are no Paper Shales, and no red sandy clay between the Transition

bed and Fish bed. It is very probable that the Fish bed of this district

embraces the fauna of all the beds from E to J of tbe general section.

The   fossils would seem  to  indicate  this                         indeed, we  believe  there                           is  no

fossil from the beds E and P that is not included in the Fish-bed list.

No crushed Ammonites, and no Aptychi, have been found in the Fisli

bed, where it has the abnormal characters just described.
     The last section opened is situate about a mile north of Chipping

Warden. The richly fossiliferous condition of the Transition bed liere
was made known by the investigations of Mr. E. A. Walford some yeoi's
ago, when the quarry was in work. The Transition bed at Chipping
Warden is softer and more easily worked than at any other place known
to us. This may perhaps partially explain the reputed richness of the

bed.       ..

                                  Summary of Observations.

   --M. The Marhtoue Iioclc Bed. This is the most important bed of the

 Middle Lias in Northamptonshire, and throughout the country from an
 economical point of view. Its usual character in the ai'ea referred to in
 this report is that of a hard, calcareous, and ferruginous rock, varying in
 colour from a bliiish-greeu, or grey, to a reddish-brown, according to the
 amount of weathering it has experienced. Where it comes near the
 surface, as at Arbury and Catesby, it is somewhat fissile, and so of little
value except for road mending. Where dug from a considerable depth

it may be obtained in large blocks suitable for building purposes, par-

 ticularly if care be exercised in placing it in the building as it exists in
.the bed.

      In no portion of the area investigated is it rich enough in iron to be
 used as an ore, though in the south-western portion of the county, at
 King's Sutton, it has been so used. The calcareous matter in it is con-
 sidered an advantage, as the stone will flux itself.

      Between Catesby and Chipping Warden the bed gets very sandy, and

 this character is particularly noticeable near to Byfield.
      The thickness varies from 4 feet to 12 feet, the average being about

 5 or 6 feet.

      The dominant fossils are brachiopods.
      lihijnchoneUa tetrahedra occurs in masses, and Terehratulci punctata

more rarely in tlie same manner. Bands composed of ossicles and frag-
ments of shells sometimes extend for a considerable distance. The

--characteristic ammonite, A. spinatus, is exceedingly rare.
     K, L. The Transition Beds. These beds in Northamptonshire usually
consist of a rather thin baud of grey friable marl passing upwards into a,
red sandy clay, though the latter is not unfrequently absent where the

foi'mer may be distinctly identified.

      The marl, in its most typical form, appears to consist of a highly
porous, calcareous matrix containing numerous small rounded grains of
the same composition, which latter maj^ be plentiful enough to give it
an oolitic character. It weathers reddish-brown on exposure. The
lower portion sometimes passes into a hard compact limestone, but even
then, apart from the fossils, it can usually be identified, though its exact

junction with the rock bed may remain doubtful.
     The thickness, including the red sandy clay, seldom exceeds 6 inches,

but at Milton they together measure a foot.
     The red sandy day does not, as a rule, contain fossils, but at Milton

it contained a good many casts of belemnites and evidences of other

fossils.

    The lower portion of the Transition beds may be described as a highly

fossiliferous bed, both as regards individuals and species, though, as the
fossils are mostly small, and require a good deal of patient searching for,
it would not always give a stranger to it that impression, and of course
it is not equally fossiliferous everywhere.

     The most characteristic fossil is Ammonites acuhis, and it is doubtful if
this species has been found out of this particular zone, though some of the
smaller specimens from beds above may be very close to it. The sudden
apjjearance of this ammonite in threat niiinhers, and its equally sudden dis-
appearance or change are matters of considerable interest that require
further investigation. The other ammonites, of the genus Stephanoceras,
are nearly equally abundant, but some of these com.e fully developed, and

also occur in higher beds.
     The striking fossils here, however, are the gasteropods, as will be

noticed by the list.
     Another noticeable feature of the Transition beds is the generally small

size of the fossils (gasteropods excepted), and particularly of the brachio-
pods and other survivors of the Middle Lias period. Small specimens of
Rhynclionella tetrahedra are probably more abundant than any other

--fossil.
     G, I. The Fish Bed. The Fish bed proper is mostly a single band of
argillaceous limestone or of flat limestone nodules, both of which split

easily in a longitudinal direction after exposure to atmospheric influences

for some time, and in doing so nearly always expose a number of fragment-
ary fish remains.

     The nodules with us are never concretionary, and in all probability
their pai'ticular condition has been brought about by water percolating
through joints in the bed, because the upper surface is mostly more
convex than the lower, and they all show the same horizontal stratification
(compare description of Bugbrook section).

     The stone has characters which enable a geologist to readily identify
it when in its normal condition. It is yellowish or quite white on the
exterior, and bluish-grey, light-brown, or yellowish inside, according to
the amount of weathering undergone.
     ON THE FOSSILIFEROUS TIUNSITION BED IN NOETIIAMrTONSUIKE. 347

     The stone, which has got coloured light-brown throughout, nearly
always shows a large number of parallel, nearly microscopic veins, extend-
ing right across the stone. The veins look like, and pi-obaby are, minute
cracks filled in with crystallised cai'bonate of lime, and on the weathered
surface of such stones these veins stand out in relief. The same character
was observed in the Fish bed of Alderton, Gloucestershire.

     The above is a description of the bed as it occurs at Milton, Bngbrook,
and some other parts of the county, but at Arbury Hill, Catesby, Byfield,
Chipjjing Warden, &c,, it is quite diS'erent. At these places it is very
irregular in composition and difficult to describe ; it weathers rather yellow
than white, contains fewer fish remains and more ammonites. The Paper
Shales have not been detected where there is an abundant ammonite fauna
in the Fish bed, hence the suggestion that this is an attenuated zone re-
presenting in time and in fossil contents more than one of the beds given
in the general section. Another reason may be found in the singular
absence of anmionites of the genus Stephanoceras from the Fish beds of
Milton and Bugbrook, although found above and below, and their great
abundance in the Fish bed of Arbury Hill and Catesby, &c.

     The most distinctive fossils found in the Fish bed, besides the fish
remains, arc the Aptycld of Ammonites, cephalopods allied to the Loligo
and Sepia, CeritJdum gradatum ? Euomj^halus minidus, Inoceramus dubiiis
and a Goniomya.

     H, J. The Paper Shales are finely laminated shales having a very

regular and clean plane of division. When exposed to a dry atmosphere

the thin layers often exhibit a tendency to spontaneous separation from
each other, and even curl up at the edges.

     The shales at any place are closely like the Fish bed at the same place
in colour, &c., and there is no doubt that the Fish bed proper must only
be regarded as a more indurated portion of tbe shales. This easily
accounts for more than one hard layer at some places (cf. Milton).

     So far as we can judge, the fossils in the shales and Fish bed are
identically the same, only that in the shales the ammonites are mostly
crushed quite flat. The crushing may perhaps be accounted for by an
abundance of organic matter in those beds, which, as it decayed, per-
mitted them to give way under the pressure of sediment above. Ammo-
nites e^ratus seems to have resisted compression better than the other

ammonites.
     The sudden appearance and decline of fish is a matter deserving of

attention. Not a fragment of any kind appears to have been found in
the Marlstone, and scarcely any in the beds just above the Fish bed.

     The shales are better developed at Milton and Bugbrook than else-
where in the county.

   --C, D. The Serpentinus Beds. These beds form the upper portion only

of what is usually called the ' Serpentinus ' zone ; the latter would include
the Fish bed and shales. Mr. Buckman recommends that these beds be
called the Falcifer beds and the zone the Falciferum zone, because,
although many ammonites of the falcifer group occur, very few agree with
the type of A. serpentinus itself ; hence a more general term is desirable.
This would agree with the Continental nomenclature.

     This sub-zone rests upon the Fish beds, and usually consists of a bed of
calcareous clay, capped by an argillaceous limestone containing some large
ammonites of the ' Falcifer ' group.

   --K, F. This investigation has brought out the fact that there is a

distinct cephalopoda bed, or may be two beds, at the base of the clay, as

well as at the top, in some places (Milton and Bagbrook).

This bed had been previously noticed at Milton, but as the fossils

found in it are, on the whole, very similar to those found in what we have

usually called the Lower Cephalopoda bed, it was thought to be that bed,

and the usually intervening clay absent. This has been completely set at

rest now by the finding of a full sequence of the beds at Bugbrook (see

Bngbrook section).

It is at present doubtful whether this bed should be classed as the

lowest of the ' Serpentinus ' beds or the highest of the Fish beds. There

is much reason for the latter course, as it contains many flattened ammo-

nites at Bugbrook like those in the Paper Shales, also Aptychi at both

Milton and Bugbrook, and these had never before been found out of the

WeFish zone.  prefer at present to leave it as a doubtful, or transitional!

zone.

     D. The day may be dark blue when freshly exposed, but gets very
light coloured on exposure, and when dry cracks into roughly cubical

masses ; the freshly exposed surfaces are often quite purple. In some places
it contains numerous little white concretions, as does also the Cephalopoda

bed above.
      Thickness a few inches to 5 feet.

      There are very few noticeable fossils in this clay, except just at the
base, where the bed often gets shaly, or develops into a distinct hard
bed (see sections at Milton and Bugbrook).

     A small group of new forms of Foraminifera have been described by

Dr. Rudolph Haeusler ' from clays above the Fish bed at Byfield, collected
by Mr. E. A. Walford, F.G.S. Ophthahnidium Walfordi, 0. ·mibeculani-

forme, &c. An elaborate comparison is drawn between certain Jurassic

Miliolidae of the Jura and those of the neighbourhood of Banbury, Oxon.

   --C. Lower Geplialopoda Bed. The ' Serpentinus ' beds are capped by an

argillaceous limestone containing some very large specimens of Ammonites
Strangivaysi and others of the falcifer group ; hence the term Cephalopoda
bed. It varies from dark blue to light yellow colour, according fo
nearness to the surface ; but even the light-coloured pieces exhibit a

bluish or violet-coloured interior If sufficiently thick. It often appears

water- worn. Thickness about 6 inches.
     The most characteristic fossils of this sub-zone appear to be Ammonites

subplanatus, Amberlya capitanea, Opis curvirostris ? and Onustus sjoinosus.

--All of them rather rare.
     A, B. Communis Beds. These also consist of a clay capped by a
Cephalopoda bed.

      B. The clay is very In'egular in composition, varying much, apparently,
in the amount of sand and calcareous matter. It generally contains a
large number of small white concretions, as does also the hard bed above

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

also small arglllo-calcareous nodules, like larger ones found commonly in
higher beds, appear in this for the first time in the Upper Lias.

     The clay is most easily identified by the presence in it of large
numbers of small ammonites, chiefly A. communis and A. Holandrei,
which are generally quite white.

      Average thickness about 3 feet.

called locally, is very variable in character, but almost always fissile.
The description of this bed at Bugbrook gives a fair idea of the bed over
the area embraced by this report. At Bugbrook it is very fossiliferous,
Amvi07iites communis, A. Holandrei, and A. hifrons largely predominatino-.

Singularly, in this bed the fossils seem to lie anyhow; many of the

specimens, particularly A. hifrons, stand quite upright in it, instead of
lying ou their sides as is usual.

     The most charactei-istic fossils of this sub-zone, besides those men-
tioned above, are Belemnites snbtenuis, and other long, slender forms

Trochus duplicatus, T. Northatiiptonensis, Eucijdas acuminatus, d'Orb.,
Nucula claviformis, and Ammonites subcarinatus.

           Conclusions.

--Maps. It may be noted here that over most of the area embraced by

these investigations there is a capping of Upper Lias, varying from a

couple of feet to 10 or 12 feet, where the maps show only Marlstone.

The hard beds near the base of the Upper Lias seem to have protected

the intervening clay beds from denudation, and these latter have largely

protected the Marlstone rock bed itself, making it thus a more valuable

--stone than it would otherwise have been.
    Horizon of Fossils. The fact noted above may account for the

incorrect determination of the horizon of a number of fossils collected

many years ago by Miss Baker, now in the British Museum and other
Weplaces.
           would particularly call attention to the specimen of Lepidotus

(jigas, Agassiz, now in the British Museum, which is, or was, labelled as

from the Marlstone of Bugbrook. This certainly came from the Fish

bed of that district, as did also another specimen now in the Northampton

Museum.

     Of the other fossils, chiefly ammonites, labelled as from the Marlstone,

there can be little doubt that they came from the inconstant hard bed
just above the Paper Shales. It seems highly probable that all the beds
from this Cephalopoda bed to the base of the rock bed, which constitute
almost one continuous hard layer, were formerly regarded as Marlstone.

                                     Correlation of the Beds.

  --Boch Bed. There is probably no zone of the Lias more distinctly

marked, lithologically and palajontologically, than the Marlstone rock
bed. Right across the country from Dorsetshire to Yorkshire it is
scarcely ever absent, and it varies comparatively little.

     The correlation of the beds above the rock bed is not quite so certain,
but we would submit some evidences of the contemporaneity of the beds
variously designated as below :

          Bleurotomaria Bed of DorsefsMre (Day).'
          Leptiena Beds of Somersetshire and OloncestersJdre (Moore),
           Transition Beds of Northamptonshire (Walford).
          Annulattis Zone ofTorlshire (Tate and Blake).

     1. The situation of each of these beds is the same, viz., just above
the rock bed of the Middle Lias and below the Fish bed of the Upper

Lias.

    ' Dr. Wright did not admit that the Pleurotomaria bed of Mr. Day was the
equivalent of the Transition bed of the Midlands.--E. W.
350 REPORT-- 1891.

     2. With regard to the Fleurotomaria bed, it is characterised by the
mixture of Upper and Middle Lias fossils, tbe ammonites in particular
being Upper Lias forms and nearly identical with those found in
Northamptonshire ; also gasteropods are met with of many species. One
of the lamellibranchs that Day particularly mentions as a rare form

--Sanguinolnria retusta is abundant at Milton in the Transition bed,

though not found elsewhare.
     3. The Le-ptrrna Chiys of Moore agree in position with our Transition

bed, but evidently inclade also the shales bolow the Fish bed, for Moore
both speaks of the Lepteeua beds as extending from the Marlstone to the
Fish bed at Dambleton, and also refers ' to the flattened impressions of
ammonites and their aptychi, and fish remains in the upper portion.

     Not only does the description of the beds lead to the belief that they
are the repi-esentatives of the Transition bed and part of the Paper Shales,
but we have found between the typical localities of Ilminster and
Dambleton, viz., at Stinchcombe Hill, in Gloucestershire, a red sandy clay
just above the rock bed with Ammonites aontns in it.

     4. The Animlatus Zone of Yorkshire, of Tate and Blake, is so clearly a.
Transition zone from the Middle to the Upper Lias that the contem-
poraneity of this with the Transition bed of Northamptonshire need
scarcely be insisted upon. It would appear that whilst there was a
period of rest, or actual denudation of previously deposited matter, at
the termination of the Middle Lias era in some parts of the ^Midland and
South-western counties, in Yorkshire from tbe first, and soma few other
places after a time, a deposit was taking place.

     Here, again, we have a set of beds differently named, but which can be

distinctly recognised as the same, extending over an area from Somerset-
shire to Yorkshire, and very seldom entirely absent.

     (1) It is exceedingly probable that the lower part of the Upper Lias
limestone on the south coast is the representative of the Fish bed, for,
according to Mr. Day's description, it contains Ammonites serpentinus in
abundance, and does not differ more from the typical form than does the
same bed only a few miles apart in Northamptonshire (compare Bug-
brook and Catesby). The list of fossils given from the upper part is

consistent with this view.
     (2) The Fish and Saurian Zone is certainly the same as the Fish bed

and Paper Shales of Northamptonshire, and this investigation shows that
it would be a not inappropriate name. "^

     (3) Fish and Insect Beds would not be quite so suitable a description,
as insects seem to be very local.

that tlie beds liave such a great lateral development, and can be K.ppro-
priately named otherwise.

   --(-5) ^ Animal' Dogger and Jet-roch Series. There can be little donbt

from Messrs. Tate and Blake's description of these beds that they are the
equivalents of the beds described in this paper as the Fish bed and
Paper Shales. The points of similarity are these :

     (a) The horizon is the same, viz., just above the ' Annulatus ' beds.
      (6) Large numbers of fishes and I'eptiles occur, including of the former
Tjeptolepis, Lejndofas, and Pac.hycorimis.
      (c) Apiycld of ammonites are a peculiar feature of the series, being
found in no other member of the Yorkshire Lias.
     {d) Cephalopods allied to the LoUgo or the Sepia are only developed

here.

     (e) The ammonites are similar, and compressed specimens of A. com-
planatus and A. serpentinus occur over all the beds.

     (/) Euomphalus mimitus and Inoceramus duhius are common, the latter
being the most characteristic fossil.

    (<j) Wood is abundant.

    We cannot with certainty carry the correlation further, but probably

more complete investigations would show a similar correspondence until
the sands of the South-western counties began to form. It may be that
the ' Cheese ' dogger at Saltwick Nab in Yorkshire represents one of our
Cephalopoda beds.

     The Committee desire to express their thanks to the British Associa-
tion for giving them the opportunity of investigating a set of beds of
great interest locally, and they hope of some interest to geologists

generally.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr. J. W. Davis (Chair-

The Elbolton Cave Exploration was continued under the direction of
 your Committee until the end of December ]890. The entrance to the

 cave is through a shaft or pot-hole 20 feet in depth situated at the
 foot of a small limestone scar on Elbolton 1,000 feet above sea-leveL
 The chamber, before the exploration commenced, was 30 feet long, and
 varied from 7 to 13 feet in width. The floor was fairly level, with the

 exception of a heap of stones under the entrance. On the surface
 nothing was observed but a few sheep bones of recent origin. The

 upper stratum, which varied in thickness from 4 feet at the east to
 17 feet at the west end of the chamber, is the only one wherein human
 remains have yet been found. It consisted of loose angular fragments of
 limestone interspersed with large quantities of bones of Bos longifrons,
 the horse, the boar, dog, red deer, sheep, &c. The bones of the larger
 animals were split and broken, and were evidently used as food. Burnt

bones acd cliarcoal were found in three places. Three human skeletons

were discovered buried 5 feet below the floor level, with the legs bent and
the knees drawn up close to the skull. The other human bones were

more or less scattered. Most of the skulls were shattered, though two,

obtained from the east end, are fairly preserved, and are dolichocephalic,

the index of one being 73 4. Two skeletons in very bad condition were

also found at the other end of the chamber at a much lower level, 13 and

15 feet respectively below the floor (one lying but a few inches above the

clay containing bones of the bear and reindeer). The latter specimens

are more decayed than the others, and could not be measured. Associated

with them was pottery of diSerent character to that which was found in

the other parts of the cave. It is thicker, ruder, and ornamented with

triangular-shaped characters made with an angular tool. The pottery

found near the other specimens at the higher level was marked with

straight lines, which in some cases cut one another and form a diamond-

shaped ornamentation, in others the lines go in and out without intersect-

ing, and form a ' herring-bone ' pattern ; others had impressions made by
some rounded bone tool. Both kinds of pottery were made from clay

similar to that found in the cave, and both kinds were hand-fashioned

without wheel, and charred and brirned from the inside. No flints or metal

of any kind have been found in the cave. The only objects obtained have

been bone pins and a few other worked bones.

Nearly all of the upper stratum containing human remains had been

cleared away before August 1890, and the next layer had been worked

for some distance, especially in the second shaft at the west end of the

chamber. So far this lower stratum was composed of stiff clay, with

angular fragments of limestone and at times a thin bed of stalagmite.

No human remains or any of the animals associated with them have

been found. These are i-eplaced mainly by bears, both Ursus ferox and

Ursus arctos, and great numbers of Alpine hares and foxes. The bones

in this layer show no evidence of having been gnawed     by other animals
                                                                                                                                        ;

they either perished in the fissure or their bones were washed down

through pot-holes into the cave. The bones from the lower layer are

darker, much harder, and less porous than those from the upper one.

After the meeting of the Association at Leeds the efibrts of your

Committee were first directed to the careful examination of the lower

Aclay bed in the centre of the chamber.  pot-hole, about 10 feet deep

and 3 in width, was cleared out. Tliis contained a few of the limb

underneath it we should find an old deposit. So far, however, it is

solid. Further west the excavation was continued, the difliculty of

working in the soft adhesive clay increasing. The percentage of bones

was small, and in the next 6 feet not a single bone was found. The

cave has now developed into a deep fissure, and is from 4 to 6 feet in

width at a depth of about 45 feet from the original level of the cave

floor. The attention of your Committee was next directed to find any

possible entrance to the cave in addition to the present one : the floor

was tested along the sides of the cave east of the first ladder, but the

miners report that there the ground was all solid rock.

Between the barren clay section and the second ladder there is a

quantity of unexplored material. Huge blocks of fallen rock are wedged
             ON THK CAVE AT ELBOLTOX.                          353

in the fissure, and it was found unsafe to remove tlicm as they underpin

an immense overhanging side of the cave 60 feet in height. The second

ladder was then descended, and a level driven beneath the fallen blocks

at a depth of 45 feet measured from the first floor. For the first 6 feet

this level was as ossiferous as any of the material yet examined, and of

similar character, containing bones of the bear and hai^e. Beneath was a

barren clay, followed by beds of sharp quartz sand, until the level is barred

by solid rock. In the descent two or three stalagmitic floors were pierced,
but the material continued the same above and below the stalagmite.

The new chambers that were opened last year ai'e extensions of this

fissure. The miners have put a steel rod 8 feet lower than present level,

forcing it through another stalagmitic floor. While the east part of this

level is sand, containing no bones, the western part and the passage up to

the new chamber is a brecciated mass of bones and stalagmite.
    At the farther extremity of the new chambers, and about 60 yards

from foot of second laddei", there was a deep pool into which the roof

dipped. In the floor cf the passage leading to the pool a hole 8 feet deep

was dug. The material was comminuted limestone. Here also bones of

young bears were found. They had evidently been washed down from

the first chamber. By means of this excavation the pond was lowered 4

Aor 5 feet.  ladder was placed across it, and an entrance eS"ected into a

further passage leading to a large natural chamber.

    So far the cave has been interesting. What may be entombed in the

unexplored depths of the fissure is a matter of pure conjecture. Whether

a repetition of the finds in the fissure at Ray Gill, and in the lower cave

earth of the Victoria Cave, with the addition of pakeolithic man, must be

left for future exploration to determine.

Tour Committee request reappointment, and that a grant of 25Z. may

be made to assist in the further exploration of the cave.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. John Evans (Chairman)
    Mr. B. Harrison (Secretary), and Professors J. Prestwich and
     H. Gr. Seeley, appointed to carry on excavations at Oldbury
     Hill, near Ightham, in order to ascertain the existence or other-

    wise of Rock-shelters at this spot. Drawn upj by Mr. B. Har-

      rison.

Owing to hindrances, the work could not be begun until August, 1890.

The first excavation, immediately below the exposed rocks, was unpro-

ductive in a great measure. This was owing to huge trees being close

by, the roots of which, forming a perfect netwoi'k, ofiiered serious obstacles,

as, though permission had been granted by the owner to excavate, yet
damage to the trees was strictly forbidden.

   A section was first cut parallel with the face of the rock, but no true

floor was reached, the rock itself being too near the surface, and forming

merely a shoulder under the surface soil.

    Many days at this being unsuccessful, another excavation was made
on the slope of the hill iust below, and a considerable area was trenched

to a deptli of about 3 feel.

     Here, however, only Xeolitliic flakes -were foand ; and great blocks,
fallen from above, and deeply imbedded in the soil, presented obstacles

not easy to surmount.

     Later on work was commenced lower down still, at a spot where, in
cultivating the ground in former years, relics of Palasolithic age had been

found.

    Two implements were secured, but the rocky conditions tried my

labourers' strength ; and to do the work thoroughly hoi'se-power was

needed, the blocks in many instances weighing more than half a ton.

   A good large area, however, was here trenched to a depth varying

from 3 to 5 feet.
     The slope of the bold projecting spur below Mount Pleasant, lying

about fifty yards south-east of the former digging, was next tried, and
here success crowned our efforts, for very soon immense numbers of flakes
were met with, and in such profusion that I was prompted to carry on the

work thoroughly.
     Leave was asked for and granted for an area of some 9 or 10 rods to

be worked over, and ere long finely fashioned characteristic Palgeolithic
implements were found daily, as well as flakes, some of these so minute
that it seemed as if the place of the actual workshop had been lighted

on.

     Altogether 49 well-finislied implements, or portions of them, and

648 waste flakes, have been found at this sjjot, leading to the supposition

either that this was the frontage of a rock-shelter, or that the material

Wehad slipped down from above.  think that it would be highly desir-

able to make further excavations in this and the adjacent area.

The greater portion of these flakes were found at depths varying from

2^ to 3 feet ; and, as a rule, they lay at the base of, or immediately
overlying a gravelly wash. The implements are very similar to some of

those found in the rock-shelters of central France.
      Similar conditions to those of this sj^ur appear on the north-west side

of Oldbury Hill, near to an outcrop of rock ; and at various times imple-
ments have been found near it.

     Leave has been granted for work to be carried on here.

Fourth Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Flowek
     {Chairman), j\Ir. 1). Morris (Secretary), j\Ir. Carudthers, Dr.
     ScLATER, Mr. TiiisELTOxN-DyER, Dr. Sharp, Mr. F. DuCane G-od-
     MAN, Professor Newton, Dr. GiJNTHER, and Colonel Feilden,
     appointed for the purpose of reporting on the present state of
     our hwivledge of the Zoology and Botany of the West India
     Islands, and taking steps to investigate ascertained deficiencies
    in the Fauna and Flora.

This Committee was appointed in 1887, and it has been reappointed each
year until the present time.

    During the past j-ear IMr. F. DuCane Godman, F.E..S., has continued
to employ a collector in the island of St. Vincent, and owing to the valu-
able assistance thus afiToi'ded to the Committee it has been possible to
compl«!te the exploration of this island. The collections in zoology are
        ON THE ZOOLOGY AND BOTANY OF THE WEST INDIA ISLANDS. 355

very extensive, and those in botany extend to the whole of the phanero-

gams and the vascular cryptogams. No expense has been incurred by

the Committee in regard to any of these collections in St. Vincent.
     The services of Mr. R. V. Sherriug, F.L.S., were accepted, as men-

tioned in the last report, to make botanical collections in the island of
Grenada. He left this country in October last and returned after seven
months' absence in June last. Mr. Sherring has forwarded to this
country large collections, consisting for the most part of vascular crypto-

Agams, and these are now in course of being determined at Kew.

detailed i-eport on the various collections in zoology and botany received
during the past year is given below.

     At the present time Mr. Herbert H. Smith, the collector employed by
Mr. Godman, is making collections in zoology in the island of Grenada.
This is the most southerly of the chain of islands intended to be explored

by the Committee. When this island is completed the Committee will

have been engaged in investigating the fauna and flora of most of the
islands in the Lesser Antilles lying between Martinique and Trinidad.
The islands in which collections have so far been made consist of Domi-
rica, St. Lucia, Barbados, St. Vincent, the Grenadines, and Grenada.

                                                                                                                                                   Zoology.

Since the last report collections have continued to be received from

St. Vincent by Mr. Godman. The work of sorting and arranging these

collections has been begun. The arthropods are already completed, and

the larger part of the insects is mounted a,nd prepared for despatch to the
specialists who have been engaged to work them out.

For this purpose the Committee have been so fortunate as to obtain the

assistance of the following naturalists : Herr Hofrath Brunner v. Wat-

ham for Attidte. The Committee have undertaken to procure publication

of the memoirs that may be received from these savants.

A small collection of specimens made by Dr. H. A. Alford Nicholls,

F.L.S., local secretary to the Committee in the island of Dominica, was

received in May last. This consisted of nine mammals, one lizard, one

snake, five fishes, one Ascalaphus, twelve Longicornia, two PassalidEe, and

five Lamellicornia. Besides these Dr. Nicholls sent from the island of
Tobago four of the peculiar nests of the yellow-tailed bird of that island

{Gassiciis cristatus). These birds usually build their nests depending from

isolated branches of the silk-cotton tree {Eriodendron anfractuosum), and
they look like huge fruits waving in the wind.

   A small collection of Lepidoptera was received in November last from

Captain Hellard, R.E., local secretary to the Committee in the island

of St. Lucia. The mounted specimens in this collection arrived in bad
order owing to the pieces of camphor getting loose in the boxes and
breaking the greater part of them, including almost the whole of the

Sphingido'.

    Mr. John C. Wells, who has devoted attention to the ornithology of

Grenada, has kindly consented to act as a local secretary for that island.

          BoTAxr.

Of the botanical collections received from St. Vincent the vascular

cryptogams have been determined by Mr. J. G. Baker, F.R.S., and an

account of them, with two plates, printed in the 'Annals of Botany,'

vol. V. (April, 1891), pp. 163-172. Amongst the ferns the most striking
novelty is a new species of Asplenium, named A. Godmani, Baker (pi. xi.},

found in damp forests at the extreme top of Morne a Garou, Other new

species are Hipnenophyllum vincentiniim, Baker (pi. x.), and Acrostichxim

(^Elaphoglossum) Smithii, Baker. The total number of vascular cryptogams

found recently in St. Vincent amounts to 168 species. Most of these are

widely spread through tropical America and only four are endemic. In

addition to the above a new species of Hepaticoc, also from St. Vincent

(Kantia vincentina, C. H. Wright), was described in the 'Journal of

Botany,' vol. xxix. (April, 1891), p. 107.

     Of the phanerogams from St. Vincent and some of the Grenadines

the work of determining these is being carried on as expeditiously as

circumstances permit. The collection is a very large one, and the results

so far attained are contained in the following memorandam prepared by
Mr. R. A. Rolie :--

The flowering plants have been determined as far as the end of

Ratacei3e. Those from St. Vincent number slightly over a hundred

species, of which about thirty, consisting for the most part of common

West Indian plants, were not previously recorded from the island. The

most interesting plant is a species of Trigijneia (apparently new), a small

tropical American genus of Anonaceae not hitherto detected in the West

AIndies.  Glusia and a species of Tetrapterijs, which cannot be identified,

may also prove new. The remainder have been fully determined. The

three most interesting of these are Noravtca JusdcBi, Tr. and PI., pre-

viously known only from Guadaloupe and Dominica; Zantlioxylon micro-

carpum, Griseb., from Dominica and Trinidad ; and Z. spinosum, Sw.,

from Dominica, Jamaica, and Cuba. The composition of the flora of

the Lesser Grenadines, situated between St. Vincent and Grenada, was

previously almost unknown. The plants hitherto determined are as

--follows : From the island of Bequia, 34 species ; from Mustique, 18

from Canouan, o ; and from Union, the nearest to Grenada, 5. They are
without exception common West Indian plants, and are all also natives

of St. Vincent. From the results hitherto obtained it seems clear that

the flora of the Lesser Antilles is tolerably uniform throughout, although

the larger islands of Dominica, Martinique, St. Lucia, and possibly

St. Vincent, appear to have each a very small endemic element.

     The collections made by Mr. Sherring at Grenada consist of nearly
6,000 specimens of vascular cryptogams and about 1,000 specimens of
phanerogams. The number of species of ferns is about 140, and of these
two are new, viz., Alsophila Elliottii, Baker, and Acrostichum Sherringii,
Baker. The phanerogams have not yet been Avorked out. Sixty species
of ferns were previously known from Grenada from collections made by
Mr. G. R. Murray, F.L.S., and Mr. W. R. Elliott. Mr. Sherring has
increased this number to 140. The species of greatest interest, other
than those known to be new, are Asplenium Godmani, Baker, recently
found in St. Vincent ; Polypodium Hartii, Jenman, first described in
188G and known only in the mountains of Jamaica and Dominica ; and
       ON THE ZOOLOGY AND BOTANY OF THE WE5T INDIA ISLANDS. 357

Ai-wstichtvi Auhertii, widely spread in continental America, but new to
the West Indies. Other interesting plants collected by Mr. Sherring are
Schizcca jluminensis, Miers, new to the West Indies, but believed to be
only a shade variety of S. dichotoma, and Bamea pohjmorpha, Leprieur, a
critical form of which but little is known.

    An account of vascular cryptogams collected at Grenada is in course

of being prepared for the ' Annals of Botany.'
     Mr. Sherring has prepared an interesting report on the flora of

Grenada, and this, with a valuable series of photographs, to be shown at
the Cardiff meeting of the British Association, will prove of great interest
to students of West Indian botany.

   A collection of plants was received from Dr. NichoUs at the same

--time as the specimens in zoology already noticed. These consisted of fifty-

six species of vascular cryptogams all of them were, however, well-known

--West Indian plants and a small number (175 numbers) of phanerogams.

The latter have not yet been determined.
     The Committee recommend their reappointment, with the ·following

members: Dr. Sclater, Mr. Carruthers, Professor Newton, Mr. Godman,
Dr. Giinther, and Dr. Sharp. The Committee also recommend that the
grant of lOOZ. placed at their disposal, but not expended during the

current year, be renewed.

Draft of Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Flower
     {Chairman), Mr. D. Sharp (Secretary), Dr. Blanford, Dr.

      HiCKSON, Professor NE-\VTO>f, Professor Eiley, INIr. 0. Salvin,

    and Dr. Sclater, appointed to report on the present state of
     our knoivledge of the Zoology of the Sandwich Islands, and to
     take steps to investigate ascertained deficiencies in the Fauna.

The Committee beg leave to state that the zoology of the Sandwich

AIslands has been only partially investigated.  very incomplete col-

lection of insects was made there some years since by the Rev. T. Black-

burn, and described by himself and others, showing that important results
as to the origin, or origins, of the fauna of the archipelago may be ex-

pected from the study of this group. The land shells of the islands are
very numerous, and are supposed to be fairly well known through the

efforts of the Rev. J. T. Gulick and Mr. Pease ; but it is the opinion of

many zoologists that additional information as to the distribution of the

moUusca in these islands would be very valuable. The birds have
been within the last few years the main object of a visit made to the

islands by Mr. Scott Wilson, who passed about eighteen months upon the

islands without being able to complete a thorough investigation of their

ornithologj'. Some departments of the zoology have not been investi-

gated in any way, and there is strong evidence that the fauna is rapidly

disappearing.

     Under these circumstances the Committee have been desirous of send-
ing a competent zoological collector to the islands ; but the grant made
by the Association being insufficient for that purpose the Committee

decided to communicate with the Hawaiian Government to learn whether

Ait would in any way assist in the research.  very favourable answer

to the application of the Committee was made by the Foreign Minister of
358 EEPORT-- 1891.

his Majesty tbe late King of the Hawaiian Islands, stating his belief
that additional fnnds would be forthcoming if a circular were drawn np
explaining the objects of the Committee, and he offered to make such a
circular known to those inhabitants who would be likely to co-operate,

provided that a portion of the collections obtained should be ultimately

placed in the Museum at Honolulu. As tbe rules of the British Associa-

tion prohibit, however, this committee from issuing such a circular with-
out the sanction of the General Committee, all operations have had to be
stayed, and the grant of 100?. made to tbe Committee has not been drawn.

     Meanwhile a committee has been appointed by the Royal Society,
and 200Z. from the Government grant placed at its disposal, for the same
purpose as this committee, power being given to tbe former to act in

concert with the latter, as was done with much advantage in the case of
the West Indian Exploration Committee.

     The Committee respectfully beg leave to recommend their reappoint-
ment, with power to act in concert with the coiiimittee appointed by the
Royal Society, and to avail themselvesof the belpproflered by the Hawaiian
Government on the terms above mentioned ; and as the estimated cost of
employing a proper zoological collector in the islands for about two
years will amount to not less than 600Z., your committee solicit a grant

of 200?.

Fifth Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Foster,
     Professor Bayley Balfour, Mr. Thiselton-Dyer, Dr. Trimen,

     Professor Marshall Ward, Mr. Carruthees, Professor Hartog,
    Mr. Walter Gardiner, and Professor Bower {Secretary)^
     appointed for the purpose of takinrj steps for the establish-
     inent of a Botanical Laboratory at Peradeniya, Ceylon.

The Committee desire first to acknowledge the continued co-operation of
the Government of Ceylon, and of the Director of the Royal Gardens at
Peradeniya, in giving facilities for study in the Royal Garden, and in
assigning a room in the official Bungalow for use as a laboratory.

     During the greater part of the year this room has been occupied by
Mr. J. Bretland Farmer, of Magdalen College, Oxford, and at the date of
writing the report he has not yet returned ; it would therefore be prema-
ture as yet to ask him for a detailed account of his work. It may,
however, be stated tbat his attention has been specially devoted to the
study of the Bryopbyta, and that a thorough investigation of these plants
in a tropical country such as Ceylon may be expected to yield most

valuable results.

     The grant of 60?. voted at the last meeting has been for the most
part expended on apparatus, which will remain permanently in the
laboratory, the most important items being a photographic camera, a
balance specially constructed for a tropical climate, and a dissecting
microscope by Zeiss.

     The Committee hope before the next meeting to receive a detailed
report from Mr. Farmer, and also a list of apparatus now in tbe laboratory
from Dr. Ti-imen. In the meanwhile, having full confidence in the value
of the results obtained, tbe Committee request that they be reappointed,
but do not at present ask for any farther grant of money.
ON THE DISArrEARANCE OF NATIVE PLANTS.  S.J'J

Fourth Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr, A. W. Wills
     {Chairman), Mr. E. W. Badger, Mr. G-. Clakidge Druce, and

      Professor Hillhouse, for the purpose of collecting information
      as to the Disappearance of Native Plants frorii their Local

     Habitats. Draivn up by Professor Hillhouse, Secretary.

For the present report the Committee solicited details as to Wales, the
border counties from Shropshire southwards, and the south-western
counties of England. As no returns have been received from Welsh
correspondents, and of the border counties only Shropshire is represented,
the report must be considered as applying to the last-named county and
the south-western counties of England. Some details as to South Wales
will be found in the report for 1890. In drawing up the list the Com-
mittee have followed the same rales as in previous years, the numbering
and nomenclature throughout being that of the ' London Catalogue,'

ed. 8, corrected reprint for 1890.

     Lists have been received from ten personal correspondents whose
initials are appended, in addition to which the Bath branch of the
Selborne Society appointed a Committee to provide returns as to the
Bath district. The Committee feel compelled to refer to the admirable
work of this young but strong and active Society in promoting the object
which the Committee have in view, work which, of its kind, is beyond

praise.

     As will be seen, the diminution of our native ferns again plays an
important part in the list, and the 'collector' and 'dealer' figure
largely. It is a matter of common and everyday knowledge that ferns
have (with the exception of the bracken) disappeared from the local
floras of our large towns ; but the ravages of the dealer are carried on so
systematically, and with the aid of all the resources that money places at
his disposal, that the most out-of-the-way places can be stripped quite as

completely as those near at hand. All the Devonshire correspondents

bear common witness to the results of his depredations in that ideal home

of the fern.

     One of our correspondents, reporting upon the area of the Bristol

 Coal-fields, writes

      Before coming' to the few instances of partial or complete extinction upon

which I am reporting, I should like to say that my experience as a field-botanist,

familiar with most of the species native in the South and West of England, has
led me to receive with caution and distrust reported disappearances of rare plants
 from their habitats in this part of the country. On investigation it has almost
 invariably turned out that such reported extinctions were not well founded, and
 had frequently been made by persons imperfectly acquainted either with the plants
 themselves or with the localities where they grow. Not long since a letter was
 published in the London ' Standard ' which condemned the ' wantonness of
 botanists,' in that they had compassed the destruction of the Euphorbia pilosit

 near l^ath, and the Cheddar Pink. My knowledge of both convinced me that the

 writer had entirely missed the station for the former plant, and that he could not
 have visited Cheddar when I), casius was in bloom. Some other supposed extinc-
 tions have proved to rest on the apparent disappearance of species (particularly
 annuals) in an unfavourable season, or succession of seasons. But these plants have
 been found to reappear when the depressing climatal influence has been withdrawn.

 As examples may be mentioned Cicuta virosa and lihijncospora fusca, ancient
360 EEPORT-- 1891.

inhabitants of the peat-moovs on the southera limit of this district. Both these

plants continue to be observed at intervals of a few years ; but so uncertain are

they in appearance that I have never yet known anyone to go specially in search

of them and be successful in his quest. But it would be an error to consider

Aeither to be in danger of extinction.  circumstance occurred only last week that

strongly confirms my contention. About twelve years ago I fnnid a large patch

Aof Craml/e maritima on the Dorsetshire coast.  year or two later the plant had

entii'ely disapi)eared, and no trace of it could be found on se^-eral subsequent visits,

the last two years ago. But on Wednesday last I was greatly pleased to see at

least twenty five specimens growing upon the exact spot whence it had been

absent for nine or ten years. Here, with some show of reason and yet in error,

might have been reported a case of extinction of a rare species.

One of tlie best known of western botanists places his finger upon

what the Committee cannot help feeling to be a source of danger to
-- --plants in the following extracts from his letter : ' In early life that is,
--before 1841 I botanised over the neighbourhood of

nately, with the late     of , drew up a list of the plants in that

district, since which many ferns have disappeared from the localities that

we gave, and I fear that  's habit of giving them will lead to the

extirpation of many other plants ; ' and another correspondent (Devon-

shire), dealing with the same point, instances Leighton's 'Flora of

Shropshire ' as one ' by the aid of which a child might walk straight up

to any plant in the county.' It is a matter, no doubt, of very grave

difficulty to determine to what extent it is desirable in a local flora to be

precise in the description of localities, and the Committee do not feel

that they are either competent or called upon to suggest laws upon the

subject. They do not see, however, that exactitude in defining locations

serves any really good purpose, and it certainly takes away somewhat

from the zest of a search, and removes an incentive to patient perse-

verance. Two correspondents illustrate the opposite method to that

complained of, inasmuch as one will not state a locality from which

Osmunda regalis is disappearing, lest thereby he should spread the know-

--ledge of its continued existence therein; and another writes: 'A few

days ago a very interesting discovery was made by a member of my

family, viz. a large patch of Maianthemum eonvallaria (L. C, 1394) in a

"wild, out-of-the-world distinct; but such a dread I have of marauders

that even in my communication with Kew I have not gone beyond

naming the county'- in which the " find " occurred.'

More than one correspondent drav/s attention to the mischief very

often done by field clubs, not merely in the reckless and often extensive

removal of rai-e plants during their periodical forays, but that in the

' Transactions,' in the local press, and privatelj'', the exact ' finds ' and

localities are indicated, so that further destruction becomes inevitable.

So long as field clubs themselves are such hardened sinnei's in this respect,

as manj' of them appear to be, it seems useless to invoke their assistance

in their respective localities for the purpose of urging upon the public

generally, and landowners particularly, the desirability of affording some

protection to the rarer of their local plants in their struggle for existence,

and of endeavouring rigidly to repress the loafers who gather the fern-
roots and hawk them for sale.

The attention of the Committee is again drawn to the unsatisfactory

condition of the law of trespass, and the consequent difficulty under which

magistrates lie when called upon to act in the interests of wild plants.

While the Committee feel that the time is not yet ripe for even

taking into consideration the desirability of making any general appeal for
Government protection, they are strongly of opinion that, in one case, at
least, of special interest alike to South Wales and South-West England,
such an appeal is urgently needed, and would probably be successful, in
favour, namely, of Pn'onia corallinu, Retz (L. C, 47), threatened with
extinction from its solo British habitat, the Steep Holmes. In this case
the Committee think that there is a special reason for an appeal to
Government, since they understand that the recent acquisition of the island
as Government property, and the consequent removal of the regulations
enforced by the pi-evions proprietor, are the direct cause of the approach-

injr extermination.

     1521. Cijperus longus, L. ' Weston-in-Gordano, North Somerset ; the
spot was anciently a fish-pond, but by gradual drainage it became a

after, and large plants are now uncommon (D. S.). Becoming yearly
 more scarce on the coast of S. Devon, ' through the greed of collectors,

Report of a Committee, consisting of Professor Newtox, Mr. John
     CoRDEAUX {Secretary), Messrs. John A. Harvie-Brown, R. M.
    Barrington, W. Eagle Clarke, and the Rev. E. P. Knubley,
     appointed at Leeds to make a digest of the observations on the
    Migration of Birds at Lighthouses and Light-vessels, which have
     been carried on by the Migration Committee of the British
     Association, and to report on the same at Cardiff.

The Committee have to report that, regarding the Migration Digest, very
considerable progress has been made during the past year with the syste-
matic tabulation of the facts collected during nine years by the Commit-
tee. These havebeen arranged under the head of species for a given month,
and on a plan that shows at a glance the date and distribution, numbers,
time of occurrence of eacli moveinent, on all coasts and subdivisions of
coasts. Initiatory steps have been taken in the preparation and print-
ing of a schedule on which these results will be finally tabulated and sub-

mitted to the Association as the chief portion of the Final Report ; also a

map showing the distribution on the British coasts for each species on
migration. These schedules and maps will form the most bulky portion
of the final digest, ard when completed will show (for several species on

each sheet) the results already mentioned, and permit of a ready compari-
son of all the movements in every aspect and over a given time.
364 KEPOiiT-- 1891.

    Your Committee would respectfully solicit their reappointment as
before ; and, while engaging to bring the enquiry to a conclnsion with the

least possible delay, they find it impossible to pledge themselves to
any fixed date for completing the work.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Fj.ower (Chair-
     rtian), Professor M. Fostek, Professor Rat Lankester, Professor

     Vines, and Mr. S. F. Hairier (Secretary), appointed for the
     purpose of arranging for the occupation of a Table at the
     Laboratory of the Marine Biological Association at Plymouth.

The Committee have followed the precedent of the previous year in not

employing the grant of 2>0l. entrusted to them in taking a table for a

complete year ; but they have made nse of portions of the grant, from

time to time, as the occasion arose.

They have nominated the following j^ersons to tlie use of a table at

Plymouth :

Miss Florence Buchanan, for one month (July, 1891).
Mr. S. J. Hickson, M.A., D.Sc, Fellow of Downing College, Cam-

bridge, for one month (from August 26, 1891).

Mr. A. Willey, for six weeks (from August 3, 1891).

No payment is made for one of these months, while the remaining

period is paid for at the rate of hi. per month. The Committee have

therefore to report that they have only spent 12?. lOs., leaving an unused

balance of V7l. \0s.

The Committee are obviously unable to give any detailed information

with regard to the results of their employment of the grant. Miss

Buchanan is ah'eady working at Plymouth, and is engaged in the sys-

tematic study of the species of Polycha3ta occurring at Plymouth, with

a view to preparing a list of the Polycha3t fauna of that neighbourhood
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

she is also making observations on the regeneration of lost parts in Nereis

and in Nephthys, and on the variation of Nereis diveri^icoJor. Mr. Hick-

son proposes  to  investigate the development of  Alcyoninm                                                   and, if time
                                                                                                           ;

permits, to study certain points in its physiology and minute anatomy.

Mr. Willey expresses his intention of investigating the group of the

Tunicata.

The Committee believe that the nominations which they have made

are a sufficient evidence of the utility of the grant in assisting well-

qualified persons who arc anxious to work at the Plymouth Laboratory
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

and they ask the Association to re-appoint them, and to place at their

disposal 171. 10s., being the unused balance of the grant made to them

at the Leeds Meeting,

     Experience has shown that applications for nomination are likely to
be made for the summer months only, as in the two preceding years.

The Committee wish to point out that, if this is the case, they do not

expect to be able to furnish at the ensuing meeting of the Association a

detailed Report on the investigations undertaken with the assistance of
the new grant ; but they hope to be in a position, if re-appointed, to give
a more complete account, in their next Report, of the results of the in-

vestigations which ai'e in progress, or which are about to be made with

the assistance of the grant which has just expired.
            ON THE ZOOLOGICAL STATION AT NAPLES.                                                       365

Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. P. L. Scl vtek, Professor

     Kay Lankestek, Professor Cossar Ewart, Professor M. Foster,
     Mr. A. Sedgwick, Professor A. M. jMarshall, and Mr. Percy

     Sladen (Secretary), nortiinated for the purpose of arranging
     for the Occupation of a Table at the Zoological Station at

      Naples.
                            [Ordered to be printed among the Reports.]

The Committee regret to report that at the last meeting of the Association

held in Leeds the Committee of Recommendations did not sanction the

Dgrant approved by the Committee of Section for the use of a table at
the Naples Zoological Station. A communication, signed by the President

of the Section, was addressed to the President of the Association, by whom

it was read at the last meeting of the General Committee, expressing the

Ddisappointment felt by the Committee of Section at the decision of the

Committee of Recommendations, and pointing out that in their opinion the

cessation of the grant would act as a serious discouragement to biological

investigation, and would place British naturalists at a great disadvantage.

Fortunately the Committee have not been deprived of the privilege

of nominating workers to occupy a table during the past year at the Naples

Zoological Station, Captain Noble, the President of Section G, having

generously given lOOZ. for the purpose of maintaining a table as in previous

years, an offer which the Genei-al Committee authorised the Committee to

take advantage of. The Committee desire to express their high apprecia-

tion of Captain Noble's singular liberality, and to place on record their
indebtedness to him for rescuing British biologists from the unenviable

position in which, but for his generosity, they Avould have been placed.

The Committee beg to direct the attention of the Association to the

fact that three applications from competent workers for permission to use
the table had been received by the Committee when they applied for the

renewal of  the grant at  Leeds                                    and  that for the last four years applica-
                                                            ;

tions have always been in the possession of the Committee to justify their

recommending the continuance of the grant, and they would, therefore,

respectfully submit to the Association that the grout has in no case been

applied for without a definite purpose, and to assist a specific object of

research.

The Committee trust that the Association will sanction the payment

of the grant of lOOZ., as in previous years, for the hire of a table in the

Zoological  Station  at  Naples                                    and  they  strongly recommend  the  con-
                                                                ;

tinuance of this grant as a means of affording to British naturalists advan-

tages for prosecuting research which are unobtainable elsewhere.

     The Committee have received an application for permission to use the
table from Mr. Arthur Willey, who proposes to make a special series of

investigations on the Ascidians, which will occupy him from the end of

September, through the winter and spring of next year, and the Com-

mittee express the hope that the Association will enable them to sanction

this application.

    Two gentlemen have occupied the table during the j^ast year, Mr.
"NVilliam R, Melly and Mr. Edward J. Bles, and their reports upon the
nature of the work undertaken are appended. The Committee would
366 EEPOET-- 1891.

direct attention to the remarks made by Mr. Bles upon the special advan-

--tages to be derived from working at the Naples Zoological Station.
     Tlie FuliUcations of the Station. The progress of the various works

undertaken by the Station is here summarised :

1. Of the 'Fauna und Flora des Golfcs von Neapel ' no monograph

has been published since the last report. The jjrcparation of the mono-

graphs compi"ised iu this sei'ies requires, on account of the complete and

exhaustive manner in which the subjects arc treated, a considerable length

of time, which can only rarely be estimated beforehand. It becomes on

this account very difficult to publish regularly a yearly set of monographs.
The comparatively small number issued lately will, however, soon be

balanced by the publication of an increased number of works, as the
following monographs are now in hand, and the three or four first named

will soon leave the press :

Prof. Delia Valle of Modena, on ' Gammarini.' Prof. Spengel of

Giessen, on ' Balanoglossus.' Dr. Giesbrecht of Naples, on ' Pelagic

Copepoda.' Dr. Jatta of Naples, on 'Cephalopoda.' Dr. Vosmaer of

Utrecht, on ' Spongia.' Prof. Falkenberg of Rostock, on ' Rhodomelese.'

Prof. Apathy of Klausenburg, on ' Hirudinei.' Dr.. Biii'ger of Giessen, on

' Nemertini.' Prof. Chun of Breslau, on ' Siphonophora.' Dr. v. Davidoff

of Munich, on ' Appendiculaiia.' Dr. Miiller of Greifswald, on ' Ostra-

coda.' Dr. Schiemenz of Naples, on ' Pteropoda.' Prof. v. Koch of

Darmstadt, on ' Alcyonario..'

2. Of the ' Mifctheilungen aus der Zoologischen Station zu Neapel,'

vol. ix., part iv. with 10 plates, has been published.

3. Of the ' Zoologischer Jahresbericht ' the whole ' Bericht ' for 1889

has been published.

4. Of the ' Guide to the Aquarium,' a new German and a new Fi'ench

Aedition (illustrated) have been published.  new English edition (illus-

trated) is being prepared.

  --Extracts from, the General Beport of the Zoological Staiion. The officers

   I. Beport on the Occupation of the Table. By Mr. William R. Mellt.

     I arrived at Naples on October 28, and was most kindly received by
Professor Dohrn.

     I worked at the Station every day until December 7, when I was
unfortunately taken ill with rheumatic fever, and remained so unwell for

the rest of my stay in Naples that I was able to do veiy little work.
    I left Naples on Saturday, January 3, as my doctor advised me to

return to England.

     Specimens of various sponges, chiefly Esperia Lorenzil containing

Spongicola, were obtained for me almost every day during the first part
of my stay. But as this animal lives in fairly deep water, it was unob-

tainable except in calm weather, and unfortunately during the last three

weeks of my stay the weather was so bad that none were procured.
    I kept my specimens in aquaria, through which a constant stream of
ON TUE ZOOLOGICAL STATION AT NAPLES.  367

water flowed. At first they seemed to thrive exceedingly well, but later
on they became very sluggish and hardly ever extended themselves.
Whether this was owing to the time of year, or to the weather, which

was exceptionally cold for Naples, or whether it was due to my having
overcrowded my tanks, I am unable to say.

       Spovgicola Jigfularis, F. E. Schulze, inhabits several of the silicious

sponges, but most of my work has been on specimens inhabiting either

Esperia hauriana, O.S., or 'Esperta Loren-ii, O.S. In these two species,
so far as I can judge from the few specimens of each that I have as yet
been able to make sections of, although the internal anatomy is the same,
the form of growth is different.

      In E. haiu-iana the chitinous tubes are straight, and do not generally

project more than 1 mm. above the surface of the sponge, and are very

long, tapering as they go deeper into the sponge, till they join each other,

forming a network. In E. Lorenzil, on the other hand, the tubes are much

shorter, that is, they form a network inside the sponge considerably sooner,

and they project often 2 or 3 mm. or even more above the surface, andai-e
generally curved. This may be due to their being different species
inhabiting different sponges, or it may be due simply to the different form
of sponges they inhabit. For whereas E. hauriana is solid all the way

through, E. Lorenzii is hollow, and therefore of course the tubes would be
obliged to become curved and to join each other nearer the surface. I

myself incline to the latter view, and I am also far from sure that when

the Monactinellid group of sponges are thoroughly worked through it will
 not be found that E. lauriana and E. Lorenzii are the same species living

 under different conditions.
      I have not studied these forms very closely, but from sections I have

of them (cut always for the purpose of obtaining sections of the enclosed

Spongicola) the anatomy of the two seems to me almost identical, as are

 also their spicules.

    Coming next to my methods of examining and killing my specimens,

the chief difficulty arose from the extreme shyness of these animals, as

 they will only extend themselves under the most favourable circumstances,
and the slightest movement is suQicient to cause the whole colony to dis-
appear again within their tubes. To examine them alive under anything
 like a high power is almost an impossibility. The slightest jar of the

 glass containing them, or of the table, almost invariably causes the instant

 disappearance of every tentacular crown in the colony.
     I have often known them retract with nothing more than the jar

 caused by the lens entering the water in which they were lying.

    When first taken from the aquaria in the morning, my specimens,

 which I placed in glass boxes about two inches in diameter and one in
 depth, full of water, would generally extend in from half an hour to an
 hour, but if they again retracted they usually took much longer, and fre-

 quently refused to extend themselves at all until they were again placed
 in running water.

      The opacity of the sponge is another source of difficulty.
      Owing also to the fact of the Spoiujicola tentacles being white against
 the opaque and also light-coloured background of the sponge, it is almost
 impossible to make out even the number of the tentacles.
       With regard to killing them extended, I had practically no success
 whatever. I have tried all the methods I could hear of, but with \evj
  poor results indeed.
368 REPORT-- 1891.

     The best results I got by pouring in very slowly, a drop at a time,
about one every minute or so,

96 per cent, methyl alcohol (CH3OH).. 10 vols.
                                        90 vols.

Natrium chloride                      0-6 vol.
                  .. ..

     After three-quarters of an hour or so, if they had not retracted, I
poured on quickly a large quantity of hot sublimate ; by this method I
succeeded in getting some specimens half retracted.

     For preserving specimens for sections I found the best results were
obtained from specimens treated for two minutes in 1 per cent, osmic
acid, then passed for two minutes through alcohol of 5, 10, 20, .30, 40 per
cent, up to 90 per cent., hardened in absolute alcohol, and imbedded in
paraffin. 1 found it best to leave the Spongicola in the sponge and dissect
it out after having hardened the whole in absolute alcohol.

     For staining I used mostly borax-carmine and hasmatoxalin, stain-
ing the SiMUfjicola whole after having dissected it from the sponge. I
did not obtain any good results from dissecting the Spongicola living,
as it seems capable of withdrawing itself to almost any extent inside
its tube, which in the interior of the sponge is very soft and easily

--torn.
     History. Spongicola fistularis was first discovered and named by
Professor All man in 1874 (Stephanoscyphus mirabilis, 'Nature,' July
30, 1874, ' Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist.,' 4th series, vol. xiv., 1874, p. 237).

He describes it as inhabiting horny sponges in shallow water on the

south coast of France.

     From the fact that he could discover no hypostome or proboscis he
came to the conclusion it was not a true hydroid. He further made out
what he believed to be four longitudinal canals extending from the base
of the tentacle-crown some distance back and projecting into the interior

of the body-cavity. These, he says, are connected with a ' circular
canal' situated in the body-wall, ' which is wide, and easily admits a
needle.' This, he says, is continuous and without septa, having a distinct
endodermal lining.

     He failed to find an endodermal lining to the longitudinal canals,

though he thinks one probably exists.

     He further states that the tentacles are placed in ' two closely ap-

proximated and alternating series of 18 each, forming a single circlet,'
and that their structure is the same as that of a typical hydroid, that
when retracted the terminal orifice is closed over them, and that the
anterior part is thin-walled and very contractile, like a hydranth in its

hydro theca.

     He divides the animal into a proximal and distal portion, and says
that the mouth is probably situated where the two join, and that the

proximal cavity is the true digestive cavity, while the distal cavity is
homologous with the umbrella, and the tentacles with the marginal
tentacles of a medusa.

     He also states there is no endodermal lining to the distal cavity,

 while the axial cavity has a well-marked one.
      Therefore, though the form and habit are those of a Hydroid Tropho-

some, its organisation is that of a medusa. So he says it is as far
removed from Hydi-oida as from Siphonophora, and he proposes therefore
       ox THE ZOOLOGICAL STATION AT NAI'LES,  3G9

-- --a new order ' Thecomedusas ' ' animals composed of composite zooids,

medusiform with circular and radiating canals, included in a chitinous
rooted perisarc, which forms the tube within which they are retractile.'

Genus Stephanoscyphtis.
     In 1877 Professor F. E. Schulze published an extensive paper on this

animal (' Archiv fiir mikroscopische Anatomic,' vol. 13, 1877).

    He failed to find either the circular or longitudinal canals described by

Professor Allman.

    He gives the structure as being ectoderm, then a layer of longitudinal

muscular fibres, then a layer of supporting lamella, and then endoderm

throughout. He describes four ' Liingswalle,' which be says are made

by the endoderm folding round longitudinal ridges of supporting lamella.
There is also, he says, a hypostome which is simply a continuation of the
body-wall bent at right angles, and the four ' Liiugswiille ' continue along
the under side of this membrane and end at its free edge.

    He gives the number of tentacles as being variable, probably a mul-

tiple of four.

    He further describes four nose-like projections from the chitinous

tube into the interior, compressing the animal in the form of a Maltese

cross.

     The results he comes to are on the whole so very different from those
of Professor Allman that he leaves it an open question as to whether the
two animals are the same or not.

      In 1886 Professor Metschnikofi" in his ' Embryologischen Studien an
Medusen,' Vienna, 1886, p. 87, suggests that this animal might be a stage
in the life history of Nausithoe, partly on account of the fact that when the
young Nausithoe reach the Scyphistoma stage they produce chitinous tubes,
into which they retract with extreme quickness, and partly relying on a
paper of Kowalewski's (' Uutersuchungen iiber die Entwickelung der
Coelenteraten ' in Nachr. Ges. Fr. &c. Moskau, vol. 10, 2, Sep., p. 36)
in which that author says that he has seen Strobilation and also Ephyraj

given off by Siephanoscijphus.
     Professor Fol (' Die erste Entwick. d. Geryoniden Eier.' Jen. Zeit., vii.,

p. 488) remarks that the larva3 of Nausithoe swim about for some weeks

in his aquaria without changing, except that thread-cells appear in their
ectoderm, after which they always die. This fact Metschnikoff also
remarks, but without mentioning that such would probably be the case,
as no doubt the young Nausithoe cannot develop without entering a

sponge.

     So far as I then knew, this was all the work that had been done on
Spongicola when, in the spring of 1890, in Professor Schulze's laboratory

in Berlin, I took up its further investigation.
    The points that seemed to me to want clearing up were :
     1. "Were Stephannscyphus mirahilis and Spongicola fistularis one and

the same animal, or different species of the same genus, or were they

altogether different ?

    2. What was the exact position of this animal in the Zoological

series ?

    3. What was the exact significance of, 1st, the ' Langswalle ' of

Schulze; '2nd, the chitinous projections into the interior of the animal ?

    I began my work on material which Professor Schulze very kindly
procured for me from Trieste, which consisted entirely of specimens of

-fe'. hauriana well stocked with Spongicola. Unfortunately, although I

--370

was enabled to make out some points with regard to the structure and
anatomy of the animal, the matei'ial was in too bad a condition to give

very good results.

    Professor Schulze made several attempts to pi'ocure me living material

from Trieste, but the specimens on every occasion arrived in a half-
macerated condition. Finally, at the end of the summer, Professor

Schulze advised my going to Naples. This, owing to the great kindness
of the British Association in placing their table at my disposal, I was

enabled to do.

    When I arrived at Naples and stated the object of my visit, Professor
Dohrn informed me that Professor Paul Mayer and Signer Lo Bianco

had during the summer made a discovery regarding Spongicola.
     1 was immediately introduced to Professor Mayer, who, with the

greatest kindness, gave me full particulars of everything he had done,
and to whom my most hearty thanks are due for nmch kind assistance
and many valuable hints.

    1 also here wish to express my indebtedness to Dr. Eisig, Signer

Salvatore Lo Bianco, and all the other assistants at the Station, for their

extreme kindness to me during my stay in Naples.

     While I was there in November, Dr. Mayer and Signor Lo Bianca

published (in the ' Zoologischer Anzeiger,' No. 851, 1890) a short paper,

* Spongicola und Nausithoe,' completely answering my No. 2 query.
    On June 20 they saw the Ephyrfe being given off fi-om the Spongicola^

which were nearly all in Strobila stages.
     These larvfe were kept and fed until, at the end of four days, they

reached, without doubt, the stage which Professor Claus has described
and figured as a young Nausithoe (' Untersuchungen liber die Organisa-
tion und Entwicklung der Medusen,' Prag und Leipzig, 1883, PI. 7,

Fig. 48), thus proving that Spongicola is the Scyphistoma stage of

Naiidtlioe.

     From this, as Dr. Mayer pointed out to me, another question arose,
namely, as to whether Professor Haeckel is right in his work on 'MedusiB'

(1879, p. 486), in saying that all the three species of Nausithoe hitherto
described, viz., N. punctata, Koll., N. marginafa, Koll., and N. albida,

Gegenbaur, are the same species.

     It seemed to me that this might be settled with regard to whether

there were more than one species of the Scyphistoma form. I therefore

turned my attention to this subject, and found that, 1st, there was the

difference in form already stated ; 2nd, the tubes that grow in the solid
sponges, and are straight, are much lighter in colour than the more curved

ones in the hollow Esperice ; 3rd, that the Spongicola with the straight
tubes have generally the yellow crystals in their tentacles (I saw none in
the body-walls), described by Kolliker, in the walls of the bell of N.
punctata. These I have never seen in the curved-tubed animals, but the

difficulty of seeing them at all may account for this, as it is only when

the animal is in a certain light that they are visible.

     Dr. Mayer and Signor Lo Bianco found them always present in the

 Ephyri3e.

     On the whole I am inclined to think that the differences I observed
are not sufficient to enable me to say with any certainty that there is

more than one species. I was, unfortunately, unable to study this ques-

tion from its other side, as only one specimen of Nausithoe Avas captured

during my stay in Naples.
ON THE ZOOLOGICAL i>TATION AT NAPLES.  371

     With regard to question No. 1, it seems to me probable that the

animals described as ' StepJianoscijphus mirabilis ' by Allmau, and ^ Spoiujicola
fistidaris ' by Schulze, are one and the same.

     I am enabled to endorse Professor Schulze in every statement he has

made, and have very little indeed to add to his work.
     The only points on which I can as yet extend his excellent paper

are -with regard to the way in which this animal retracts, and to the

structure of the ' Liingswiille ' or longitudinal ridges.

     First, as to retraction. The entire body-wall for the first half mm.,
more or less, folds over inwards, like the finger of a glove when it is
pulled inside out, bringing the tentacles into the interior of the animal
the membi'anous hypostome, which is so diflBcult to see that it might
easily have been missed, even by such an excellent observer as Professor
Allman, is pressed close against the sides of the body some way down,
leaving apparently a canal lined with endoderm, which appears to be in

the body- wall.
     This I take to be what Professor Allman mistook for a circular canal.

The tentacles are much retracted, and either lie pointing outwards, or
can be again extended deep down into the interior of the animal, when

no doubt particles of food entangled in the thi'ead-cells, with which the
tentacles are plentifully covered, are digested by the endoderm cells.

    When a careful sei'ies of transverse sections are cut, first (as might

be expected) there is a solid ring of ectoderm, then there appears
endoderm in the middle between two circular layers of ectoderm, next
a circular space is seen dividing the endoderm into two layers, which
closely approximate to the two layers of ectoderm, forming an apparent
circular canal lined with endoderm. The interior space lined with
ectoderm is filled by transverse sections of tentacles. Still deeper
sections are reached showing the tentacles given off from the internal
layer of ectoderm with the approximated layer of endoderm running out
into and forming the solid centre of each tentacle ; below that, unless
the tentacles have been projected downwards into the body of the
animal, transverse sections of them cease, and the two layers of the
endoderm again come to be closely approximated ; a few sections further
on the internal layer of ectoderm ceases, and only an external layer of
ectoderm and a layer of endoderm, separated by a layer of supporting

lamella, remain.

     Between the ectoderm and endoderm there is always a layer of clear

colourless supporting lamella, bat in the upper parts it is very thin and
in many cases hardly to be distinguished. But after the limit of in-
vagination is reached, the layer of supporting lamella becomes much
more distinctly seen ; and here also two layers of longitudinal muscular
fibres make their appearance, one on each side of it. These layers of
muscular fibi-es, proceeding lower with the series of sections, join each
 other at four places, forming, as it were, four oblong pieces of supporting
 lamella surrounded by muscle fibres. These oblong pieces gradually become
 more circular and draw away from each other, and their centres are
 filled with peculiar long-shaped cells, which are apparently thread-cells
 in various stages of development. Round these the endoderm lining the
 whole of the internal cavity makes four folds which project inwards
 into the interior of the cavity, the space between the muscle fibres and
 themselves being filled with the clear colourless supporting lamella.

      These in transverse and longitudinal sections look very like longi-

                                                                                                               BB 2
372                       rvEroiiT-- 1891.

tudinal canals, and are probably wliat Professor Allman describes as

sncb.

     The exact significance of these endodermal folds and the manner of
their attachment to the membrane forming the hypostome are points
which I had hoped before now to have cleared up from the material

which I preserved while in Naples, but, unfortunately, I have not yet

been able to find time since quitting Naples to continue my work on

Spongicola.

    With regard to the longitudinal ridges formed of developing thread-

cells and surrounded by a layer of longitudinal muscular fibres, I think,

from my investigations, there can be little doubt that they are used, not

to cause the ci'own of tentacles to invaginate in the manner described, as
they are not continued high enough up for that purpose (wliich I believe
to be eS'ected in some way by the endodermal folds), but to retract the

whole animal after it has invaginated itself into its tube.

The four chitinous nose-like projections, which are well described both

by Schulze and Allman, project inwards in snch a manner as to cause

the four longitudinal ridges of developing thread-cells to become horse-

shoe-shaped round them, and are, I think, without doubt present to

enable the animal to use its muscles with greater effect.

     Sometimes four smaller ones are present, placed between the four

larger ones.

The longitudinal ridges probably enable the whole animal to rapidly

expand again after contraction, owing to the extreme elasticity of their

contents.

     These are the chief results that I was enabled to obtain while at

Naples, but I hope that in the future I may be able to continue my work

on the material I collected while there, as there are still several points I

should like to clear up.

myIn conclusion it is, I think, unnecessary on  part, after the articles

that have lately appeai'ed, to say more in regard to the Naples Station,
but no praise could be too high for the excellent way in which everything

is managed, and the great facilities given to students for original research

of every description.

    At the present moment I believe I am correct in saying that without

having been allowed the use of the British Association table I could not

possibly have obtained either the results I have obtained or those which

I hope still to achieve by further study on the material I was enabled to

preserve while there.

myIn conclusion I wish to express  deep obligation to the British

Association for the use of their table, and to Professor Dohrn and his

.staff for all their kind assistance to me while at Naples.

II. Report on the Occupation of the Tahle. Bij Mr. Edward J. Bles.

     Having been allowed, through the kindness of the Committee, to

spend three months at the Naples Zoological Station, I left England

towards the end of December 1890, and reached Naples on December 22.

I found a well-appointed table in readiness, and on the following day

Myliving material began to arrive in more than abundance.    visit was

unfortunately broken during the eighth week by an attack of influenza,

immediately followed by complications which left me extremely weak.
ON THE ZOOLOGICAL STATION AT NAPLES.  373

 The illness and period of convalescence lasted four weeks, and seriously

interrupted the course of my work, as I only remained at the Station for

little more than a fortnight after recovery. I left Naples on March 27.
     It had been ruy intention to work at the development of the Polychseta,

but the only suitable form available at that season of the year (a Nereis)

was already appropriated by one of the workers at the Station. Eggs of
Spio fuligiuosus and of Pobjmnia nebulosa were easily obtained in quantity

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

in both cases, however, minuteness and opacity deti-act from their value

for embryological research.

      I was able to confirm Salensky's account of the segmentation stages
in the egg of S. faliginosiis. I made unsuccessful attempts to fertilise

artificially the eggs of Arenicola mariiia, A. Grubei, and Lanice conch.ilega
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

the sexual products appeared to be unripe. The first fortnight was
occupied by these preliminary studies, and in examining the rich and

varied proceeds of the daily dredgings and tow-nettings. A fresh supply
of the wonderful pelagic life in the Bay was brought in every day with
very few exceptions, and I had many opportunities of examining numerous

forms of annelidan larvae in the living condition, and of preserving a large

quantity of material. Still there seemed to be little probability of
obtaining a sufficient number of specimens in different stages of the
development of any one form, and I therefore took up, at the kind

suggestion of Professor Eisig, the study of the adult anatomy of the
Chlorhaemida3, a family of polychcet worms.

     I received numerous specimens of Siphonostoma diploclicetos, Otto, and
of Trophonia plumosa, Clap. ; further, specimens of Stylarioides monilifer,
D. Ch., and of Stylarioides Edirardsii {=Lopliiocephala Edwardsii,
Costa). Sig. Lo Bianco kindly handed over to me a few specimens of a
Stylarioides new to science, which were found associated with Balano-
(jlossus on one occasion some years ago, and has not again been seen. I
also received alive a single specimen of each of two hitherto unknown

species of Trophonia.

      I have given most attention to S. diploclicetos, as this species is con-

venient for dissection, &c., and common. The worm is 6-7 cm. long,

has 40-50 segments, and is about 1 cm. across the widest part of the

body, a third of the total length from the anterior end. From this point

backwards the animal tapers gradually to the hinder end ; the anus is
terminal. More than half of the width of the animal is taken up by the
thick investment of a substance partly colloid and partly mucous.
Through this and the transparent epidermis the brightly coloured viscera
are sometimes very clearly visible. The soft sheath covers the whole of
the body behind the first pairs of setfe. It is secreted by mucus-cells
borne in the heads of clavate, filiform, epidermal papillse. The swollen
heads of the papilla) just reach the surface of the sheath, and a secretion
from them replaces a thin mucous outer layer which is periodically cast.
To this layer adheres a continuous coating of the ooze in which the
animal lives. The fresh external deposits of mucus are soluble in a 5 to
10 per cent, solution of sodium carbonate, and are insoluble in acids.
The older internal layers are not affected by the alkaline solution, and
have probably undergone some chemical change. They are distinctly
colloid. The papillae are longer and more numerous on the dorsal than
on the ventral surface, and there is a crowded group of long ones inter-
spersed with each bundle of set». These appear to be sensory, and bear
short sensory hairs at their tips. Below the mucous sheath lies a thin
374 EEPOET-- 1891.

cuticle, in contact with both the sheath and the epidermis. The

epidermis is a single layer of squamous cells, and is devoid of mucus-

cells, with the exception of those in the heads of the papillas and those

scattered in the ciliated region round the mouth, anterior to the first

pairs of sette. In this region the papillfe are absent. The setfe of the

dorsal and ventral bundles of the fii'st segment are more numerous and

longer than those of posterior segments ; they are directed forwards, and
form a fan-shaped chevaux-de-frise on each side of the head. Their

parapodia form a large continuous fold of the integument, within which

the head can be retracted, the setfe then closing in and forming a sort of

cage. The posterior parapodia are not well developed ; the dorsal and

ventral bundles of seta3 are set on widely separated conical protuberances

connected by a slight ridge. The ventral bundles are used for progres-

sion, the animal walking on the tips of the setfp, which are inclined

forwards and then pulled back in succession from before backwards.

The alimentary canal, compared with that of other Polychajta (except

Pectinaria), is abnormal in being bent on itself several times. The narrow

oesophagus opens near the hinder end and on the dorsal surface of a

large sac-like, thin-walled stomach, which is continued into an CO-shaped

'duodenal' part of the intestine. The stomach, the 'duodenum,' the

hinder ends of the pair of uephridia, and the posterior ovaries in the

female are enclosed in the septum between segments 9 and 10. This

septum forms a complete partition between the ' thoracic ' and abdominal

portions of the coelom. It is distended by the viscera named into a large

sac, extending as far back as the IGth to 20th segment. It confines the

                                                                                      ;

is in Siphonostoma no septum anterior to it, but in Troplionia there is

also one between the fifth and sixth segments. (I am throughout regard-

ing the first setigerous segment as the first behind the head.) The

musculature of the body- wall is slight ; there are well-developed retractors

of the head.

The vascular system has attracted attention on account of the dark

green colour of the blood in all tlie species of this family. Lankester

has shown that the colouring matter, wliich he calls chlorocruorin, is, &

body which, like haemoglobin, is easily oxidised and, by suitable reagents,

reduced; it also gives a characteristic banded absorption spectrum.

Large quantities of blood are contained iu the capacious lacunfe sur-

rounding the stomach and intestine. The lacunae have no proper cellular

walls, but lie between the basement membrane of the gastric epithelium

and a membrane below the peritoneal epithelium. Connected with the

enormous lacunas at the hinder end of the stomach and running forward

dorsal to the oesophagus is a large contractile heart. It propels the

blood forward to the branchiae, dividing in a right and left afferent

branchial vessel at the hinder border of the supra- oesophageal ganglion.

Each branch runs downwards to the inner side of the bi-anchias and

sends an afferent vessel into each gill-filament. This afferent vessel is

directly continuous with an efferent vessel at the tip of the filament, thus

forming a single vascular loop in each. The efferent vessels all open

into a single large efferent trunk running parallel to and outside the

afferent trunk. The efferent trunks unite in the mid-ventral line some

distance behind the mouth, to form the sub-intestinal vessel. The heart

id to be regarded as agastric blood- lacuna, which has become independent

of the alimentary canal, but whether this applies to the anterior branchial

portion, as it does to the posterior portion, is doubtful.

The heart contains a cardiac body, similar to that present in the

Cirratulidte, Terebellidte, Amphictenidte, Ampharetidce, and Hermellidje,

all families with coloured blood. I can confirm the observations of J. T.

Cunningham on its anatomical relations and those of Jourdan on its

histological features ; but the latter has fallen into an old error by inferring
from its colour, &c., that it is a gastral csecum. In Siplionostoma there

is no connection and not even contact with the gut. Its cells are, in

hardened specimens, crowded with green grannies, which also occur in the

clotted blood, and the organ is probably concerned in the formation of the

blood-pigment. The chloragogenic cells of other polyclicet worms are

peritoneal, and in Siplionostovia the manner in which different portions

of the cardiac body are attached to the wall of the heart gives reason to

believe that its cells are peritoneal in origin. At the hinder end of the

heart there are indications of the cardiac body being paired.

The ' glandes en tubes,' ' glandes salivaires,' of earlier writers have

been conjectured to be nephridia by Wiren, Cunningham, and Jourdan,

but these investigators failed to discover the nephi'idial funnel. This is

situated at the level of the hinder border of the supra-oesophageal gan-

glion. It resembles those nephrostomes in Ajjhrodite which serve as vasa

deferentia, in its being very wide and extending from dorsal to ventral

surface. The opening is directed forwards, inwards, and downwards, and

is close to the anterior end of the coelom. It is lined by a single layer of

cells bearing long stout flagella. The funnel leads into a narrow tube

with an intercellular lumen, whose wall is composed of a single layer of

nephridial cells and an investing layer of peritoneum. This tube passes

straight back as far as the 12th segment, there bends on itself and runs

straight forward, becoming much dilated at the level of the oesophagus,

in some cases filling almost the whole of the perivisceral space. The

external aperture of the nephridium is anterior to the first bundles of

set£e on a conical papilla, one on each side, close to the protuberance

bearing the eyes and to the inner side of the branchial filaments. The

two limbs of the V-tube formed by the nephridial duct are closely apposed

along their entire length, and the investing peritoneum forms a simple

sac, as though it had been pushed inwards by the nephridium as a

whole                           there is no peritoneum  between  the apposed surfaces of  the  two
                             ;

limbs. In their position and simplicity of structure the nephridia re-

semble the single pair of thoracal nephridia in the Serpulidse. In the

Chlorhfemidge, however, abdominal nephridia do not occur. There are
no blood-vessels in the nephridia. Ova have been seen in the nephridia

of Chlorhcema by Williams, and he concluded that the segmental organs,

as he calls them, were genital glands. Here, then, the same organ

functions as an excretory organ and as a gonaduct.

     I was eventually successful in experiments on feeding with carmine,
and was able to keep the worms alive for a fortnight in filtered sea-water

containing finely-powdered carmine in suspension, by passing a constant

current of air through the Avater. As regards the nervous system and

sense-organs and the reproductive organs, I can at present add nothing

to the descriptions of Grube, Jourdan, and Jaquet.
     The zoological position of the Chlorhsemidae has often been altered.

Gmbe, who is entitled to speak with authority, places them between the
Errantia and the Tubicola, but I am inclined to believe that they wiU.

prove to be modified Ttibicola, which have secondarily acquired an errant

habit. I am continuing my work on this group, and hope to collect some

embryological material and complete the experiments on the excretion of
carmine.

    I should like to mention here my deep sense of gratitude to Professor

Dohrn and the capable staff of the Stazione for all the kindness and

attention they gave me daring my stay with them.

      Having experienced the benefits which accrue to visitors at the Naple*
Zoological Station, I feel very strongly the importance of the British
Association continuing to participate in the many advantages afforded by

 this institution.

      I will not dwell upon well-known advantages, such as the richness of
the fauna and flora ; such as the possession of a large and growing-
library, exceptionally complete in its acquisitions of current literature

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

such as the completeness and efEciency of the equipment, and the experi-
ence and matured advice of the staff yet I venture to recall the fact of

                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

the existence of comfortable and modern phj'siological and bacteriological
 laboratories, which are well attended by foi'cign investigators. In Naples,
moreover, referring now especially to morphology, so many masters have
produced work which has become classical that specialists in almost
 every group of marine animals and plants have there all the conditions
enabling them to follow in the concrete and control the results of researches
with which books have made them familiar.

      The frequent opportunities for intercourse with the leaders of Con-
 tinental schools of the biological sciences, and with some of their most
 promising pupils, are of great importance. This applies more expressly
 to Englishmen who, unlike most Germans, have not been educated at
 two or more universities. In Naples there are brought to the student, in
 many cases by their originators, the ideas prevalent and the theories in
 course of development at a large number of foreign universities. One
 can see carried out, in the daily course of practice, methods in vogue
 abroad, and can at the same time observe the results of these methods,
 form an independent opinion on their value, and be incited to suggest
improvements and new applications. Besides these mutual advantages

 there is the further one, continually increasing in importance, whicli
 consists in the obvious facilities for acquiring or improving a knowledge
 of almost every Eui-opean language.

     So large a gathering of men engaged in original investigation cannot
 fail to create what for their younger associates is a stimulating atmosphere
 of research . The companionship of representatives of all the various depart-

 ments in biology, with necessarily different trainings, will and does culti-
 vate broader views and materially forwards the desirable state of thing.s
 in which one science aids in advancing another, and, like a symbiotic
 organism, derives equivalent benefits in return. In no other Marine Biologi-
 cal Station are all the above circumstances combined as they are in that
 directed by Professor Dohrn, and in no other is the endeavour to make
 the institution truly international in character so prominent a feature in
the programme, and so successfully carried out. This endeavour it is
 surely incumbent on the greatest seafaring nation to support by all pos-
sible means, and an adequate amount of support ought surely to come
from the British Association for the Advancement of Science.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor A. C. Haddon,

    Professor W. A. Herdman, and Mr. W. E. Hoyle {Secretary}^
     appointed for improving and experimenting with a Deep-sea
     Tow-net, for opening and closing under icater.

The Committee have devised and had constructed an impi-oved form of
the apparatus for opening and closing the tow-net by an electric current,
which will be exhibited at the forthcoming meeting of the Association.

Their efforts to obtain an opportunity for experimenting in deep water
have not been successful, and hence the money destined for the purchase
of an electric cable of considerable length has not been expended. The
Committee suggest that they should be reappointed, and a sum of 40/.
(including an unspent balance of 27/. 14s. (Jd., which has been returned to
the Treasurer) should be intrusted to them.
           ON THE TEACIII.NG OF SCIENCE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 383

Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. J. H. GtLadstone
     {Chairman), Professor H. E. ARMSTRONCr (Secretary), Mr. S.
     Bourne, Dr. Crosskey, Mr. Gr. Gtladstone, Mr. J. Heywood,
     Sir John Lubbock, Sir Philip Magnus, Professor N. Story
     Maskelyne, Sir H. E. KoscoE, Sir E. Temple, and Professor
     S. P. Thompson, appointed for the purpose of continuing
     the inquiries relating to the teaching of Science in Elementary

       Schools.

Last year your Committee had to report very considerable changes in the
code of regulations issued by the Education Department which bore upon
instruction in scientific subjects in elementary schools, and also certain
additions to the Science and Art directory consequent thereon. As these
only began to take effect from September 1 last the returns of the
Education Department, issued this year, which extend down to Auo'ust
31, deal entirely with the results of examinations under the old code.
They are therefore strictly comparable with those of the seven preceding-

years.

     The following table gives the number of departments of schools in
which the several class subjects have been examined by H.M. Inspector
during each twelve months :

more in whicli geopjrapby was taught ; while, on the other hand, there
-were only 32 in all that took up elementary science, the lowest record of
any of the years under review.

     On comparing the figures for the several specific subjects in the second
table with the number of scholars qualified to take any two of them

under the rules of the Code, it will be found that there has been an im-
portant increase over the previous year in the study of algebra, mechanics,
chemistry, and magnetism and electricity ; but if the comparison be made
with the year 1885-G, or any of the preceding years, it will be found that
this year's return still shows a relative, if not an absolute, falling off in the
study of every one of the subjects, except mechanics and chemistry.

     The general result shows that the slight turm in the tide as to the
percentage of scholars taught these specific subjects as compared with the
number that might have taken them, which was just remarked in last
year's report, has been more than maintained. It will be apparent from

the following table :

In 1882-3 .         290 per cent.
 ,, 1883-4 .
 ,, 1884-5 .        20
 ,, 1885-6 .
 ,, 1886-7 .        22-6
 ,, 1887-8 .
 ,, 1888-9 .        19-9  ,,
 ,, 1889-90
                    18-1

                    16-9

                    17-0

                    18-4

     This result is mainly due to the operations of the School Boards for

London, Liverpool, Birmingham, and Nottingham, which have given much
attention to the teaching of mechanics, in some cases under the peripatetic

system and in others in special schools.
     The code of regulations which has been issued this year by the Educa-

tion Department contains only two alterations that call for notice.
     The one consists of the following note to the work required under the

--head of Arithmetic in Standard IV. (Schedule I.) : ' The scholars in

Standards V., VI., and VII. should know the principles of the metric
system, and be able to explain the advantages to be gained from uniformity
in the method of forming multiples and sub-multiples of the unit. As a

preparation for this it will be useful to give in Standard IV. elementary

lessons on the notation of decimal fractions.' This reintroduces the study
of the metric system which was dropped in the year 1874.

     The other is the addition of another alternative course of elementary
science (Schedule II., Course I.), called ' lessons on common things.' The

--course laid down for the several standards is as follows :

   --'Standard.^ I. and II. Thirty object lessons on the chief tribes of animals

and their habits, and on common plants and Iheir growth.

   --' Standard, III. Common inorganic substances and their properties.
   --' Standard IV. Simple mechanical laws in their application to common

life and industries. Pressni-e of liquids and gases.

   --' Standard V. Simple chemical laws in their application to common

life and industries.

   --' Standard VI. Outlines of physiology in its bearing on health and

work.

   --' Standard VII. Other simple physical laws, such as those of light

heat, &c.'
                            ON THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 385

     It is doubtful whether this will prove acceptable, as it involves a wider
range of study than any of those going before, in which the same subject
is carried onward from year to year. In so far, however, as the title is

concerned, the institution of this Course marks an advance in views and
is a valuable recognition of the principle that in teaching science in ele-
mentary schools it is important to base the instruction on common objects

generally.

Last year the N'ational Association for the Promotion of Technical

Education endeavoured to obtain some modifications of the alternate

courses of elementary science in Schedule II., and your Committee also

drew especial attention to certain points of which they disapproved. No

alteration, however, has been made. They can only express the hope that

this important schedule will be carefully revised for the code of next

year                        and  it  seems                                highly desirable         that  the  revision should                                           be  carried out
                         ;

with the assistance of some of the teachers who have given special atten-

tion to methods of teaching science.

It is stated at pp. 28, 29 of the Code that ' it is intended that the

instruction in elementary science shall be given mainly by experiment and

illustration. If these subjects are taught by definition and verbal de-

scription, instead of making the children exercise their own powers of

observation, they will be worthless as means of education.' It is here

clearly implied that the object of instruction in elementary science is to

lead the children to exercise their powers of ohservation ; but it is much to

be feared that the methods generally adopted in teaching the subject do

not satisfy this requirement, and it is highlj important that ampler in-

structions should be placed before teachers. ValnabJe and instructive as

are class lessons, whether ' conversational object lessons ' or lessons freely

illustrated by experiment, experience shows that their effect is but too

often  ephemeral                                                          and, above all,  it  is  to  be feared                                        that  they  do  little  towards
                                                                       ;

developing the power of independent observation, as in such lessons

children do not learn to do things themselves, but gain their information

from the teacher.

The Committee desire most strongly to urge that the time has now
come when every eflort should be made to introduce experimental lessons,

especially measurement                                                    lessons,             into    schools                                          in  other   words,      that  the
                                                                                                                                                     ;

children should be set to do simple experimental exercises themselves not

merely to attend lessons, listening to and taking notes of what is said'. It
is now clearly recognised that even in the case of students of a far higher

grade than those in the elementary schools practical instruction should

always accompany lectures and demonstrations, and this must be all the
more necessary in the case of young children. In the higher standards

not only the observing faculties, but also the reasoning faculties, should

be brought fully into play in the practical lessons. It may be added that

in the course of the measurement lessons, even in the lower standards

opportunity would be given to the children to compare the English with

the metric system, and thus the knowledge of this latter, which is now
required of the higher standards, would be easily acquired.

     If attention be once directed in the Code to the necessity for instruc-

tion of the kind suggested being given, there can be no doubt that suit-
able sets of practical exercises will soon be devised and carried into
practice. The non-recognition of their importance is at present the chief
bar to the introduction of such practical exercises.

Science demonstrators have recently been appointed by the School

1891.                                                                                                                                                                           cc

Board for Loudon, in addition to those referred to in former reports, who

are endeavouring to initiate practical work by the scholars in a number
of the schools imder their charge. The results of their work are to be
awaited with interest, as there can be no doubt that when it is once

shown that children in elementary schools can be taught to experiment

for themselves, and thereby acquire the habits of accurately observing

and later on of reasoning from observation, no great delay will arise in

introducing such teaching into schools generally.

There is little hope that any but specially trained teachers will be able

satisfactorily to conduct experimental teaching with the object of incul-

cating scientific habits of mind. Hence, bearing in mind the probability

that a revolution in methods of teaching is clearly foreshadowed, and that

the action of the Government in providing funds for technical instruction

is having a most important influence in encouraging applied science

teaching, it would seem highl\' desirable that the teachers in training

should be prepared to do what will be required of them. As it will be

their object to teach scientific method, it is all-important that their own

training in this direction should be as ample as possible, and that they

should be led to recognise more clearly than is done at present what is

the object to be gained in inti'oducing elementary science into schools    ;
--that the use of facts-- not mere facts is to be taught.

Though the scholars of elementary schools who are working in the

standards are excluded from participation in the grant out of the beer

and spirit duties, the application of this fund will have an indirect influ-

ence upon elementary education, and your Committee note with satisfaction

that throughoiit England and Wales only two counties have refused to

apply any portion of the grant to technical education, and that all the

rest, with the exception of eight, have applied the entire gi'ant to that

purpose. This extension of technical instruction among the ex-standard

children, and the scholars in evening schools, will render the preparatory

work in the elementary schools all the more important.

Third Report of the Co7nmittee, consisting of Sir J. N. Douglass,

    Professor Oshokne Keynolds, Professor W. C. Unwin, and
    Messrs, W. Topley, E. Leader Williams, W. Shelford,
    Of. F. Deacon, A. R. Hunt, W. H. Wheeler, W. Anderson, and
     H. Bamford, appointed to investigate the Action of Waves and
     Currents on the Beds and Foreshores of Estuaries by means

     of Working Models.

                                                [Plates IL-XIV.]

The Committee held a meeting in the rooms of Mr. Gr. F. Deacon,
32 Victoria Street, Westminster (July 29, 1891), and considered the

results obtained since the last report. Professor Reynolds reported that
by the date of the meeting of the British Association the objects of the
investigation would be accomplished, and suggested that it would not be
necessary to continue the investigation beyond that date or to apply to
the Association for reappointment. These suggestions were adopted, and
it was resolved that the thanks of the Committee be communica'ed to the
ON THE ACTION OF WAVES AND CURRENTS.  387

Council of the Owens College for the facilities afforded for conducting the

experiments in the Whitworth Engineering Laboratory.
     Having considered the disposal of the apparatus, which has no

pecuniary value, the Committee resolved to recommend the Association
to place it at the disposal of the Owens College.

    At a second meeting held in the Committee room of Section G at

Cardiff the report submitted by Professor Reynolds was adopted.

             By Professor Osborne Reynolds, F.B.S., M.Inst.G.E.

                            § I. Introduction to Report III.

     1. In accordance with the suggestions in the Second Report, read at
the Leeds meeting of the British Association, the inyestigation has been
continued with a view

     (1) To obtain further information as to the final condition of
equilibrium with long tidal rivers entering the head of a V-shaped

estuary.

     (2) To obtain a more complete verification of the value of the criterion

of similarity.

     (3) To investigate the effect of tides in the generator diverging from
simple harmonic tides.

     (4) To determine the comparative effect of tides varying from spring

to neap.
      Opportunity has also been taken :

     (5) To investigate the effect of prolonging the walls of the river into
the estuary through the bar which was below low water, with prolonga-

--tions reaching up to low water, and others reaching up to half-tide this

being done in both models, so that the similarity of the effects might be
seen ; and

     (6) To investigate the effect of rendering the estuaries unsym-
metrical by means of large groins, and so to test the laws of similarity
obtained in the symmetrical estuaries as applied to unsymmetrical estu-

aries.

     2. The two models have been continuously occupied in these investi-
gations, when not stopped for surveying or arranging fresh experiments.
In this way each of the models has run 600,000 tides, corresponding to
840 years. These tides have been distributed over six experiments in the
large tank E, and four in the small tank F, in number from 50,000 to

250,000.

     3. The experiments have all been conducted on the same system

as described in the previous reports.

     All the experiments but one have been made in tanks E and F, with-

out further modification ; and in all these land water to the extent of
0'5 per cent, of the tidal capacity per tide has been introduced at the top

of the river.
      Initially, the sand has been laid to the level of half-tide from Section

 13 up the river to Section 26 down the estuary. The vertical sand gauges
distributed along the middle line of the estuary have been read and

 recorded each day. Tide curves have been taken at frequent intervals.
 Contour surveys have been made, generally after 16,000 tides, and again

                                                                                                                                   cc2

after 32,000 ; while in the longer experiments farther surveys have been

made. With the spring and neap tide, the rate of action being much

the slower, intervals between the surveys have been longer. In all 26
complete surveys have been made, and 20 plans showing contours cor-
responding to every 6 feet reduced to a 30-foot tide, together with sections
and tide curves Plate III., are given in this report.

     The general conditions of each experiment, together with the general
results obtained, are shown in the table, while a description of each ex-

     The Committee have been fortunate in retaining the services of Mr.
Greenshields, who has carried out the experiments, observing and record-
ing the results, besides executing such modifications as have been required,
designing the compound harmonic gearing for the spring and neap tides,
which has answered excellently.

     Mr. Bamford has kindly continued his assistance in conducting the
investigations and reducing the results.

          § II. General Results and Conclusions.

  --4. The conditions of eqiiilihrium with a long tidal river entering at the

top of a V-shaped estuary. The experiments in tanks C and B made last

year led to the conclusion stated in Art. II of the Second Report : ' that
the effect of a river 50 miles long, when reduced to a 30-foot tide, increas-
ing gradually in width until it enters the top of a V-shaped estuary, is
entirely to change the character of that estuary. The time occupied by
the water in getting up the river and in returning causes this water to
run down the estuary while the tide is low, and necessitates a certain
depth at low water, which causes the channel to be much deeper at the
head of the cstuar}'. In its effects on the lower estuary the experiments

with the tidal river are decisive, but as regards the action of silting up-

the river further investigation is required, both to establi.sh similarity in

the models, and to ascertain the ultimate condition of final equilibrium.'
     From this year's experiments. III., IV., V., VI., and VII., in tank E>

and V. and VI. in tank F, it appears that if the length of the tidal river,

^reduced to a 20 font tide, is 50 miles; or talcing for the length of the

tidal river in miles and h for the rise of tide at the mouth of the estuary in

feet, if

          R=8-5V7t

the river will Jceep open so that the tide will rise to the top, the sand falling'

gradually from the top of the river to the level of about mean tide at the

mouth.
     That the depth of wafer in the river and at the top of the estuary increases

rapidly with the length of the river, and luhen

                                              R=I2v/7i

the level of the sand at the mouth of the river will he more than h feet helow
the level of low water and the hottom will he beloiv low water level for more

than half the length of the river above its mouth.

  E --5. The similarity of the results in the tanhs and F. The experiments

in the tanks E and F this year confirm those of last year in showing that

during the early stages of forming the estuary from sand at the level of

mean tide the action in the river is different in the small tank F from
                  ON THE ACTION OF WAVES AND CUIIUEXTS.                                          389

what it is ia the large tauk E, although the value of the criterion of
similarity /i'e ' may be but little below 0'09.

It was not found practicable to get the value of the criterion any

greater in tank F, but it was found on diminishing the rise of tide in the

Blarge tank until the criterion had a value 0-0.9, that the results were still

similar, although the rate of action and the increase in the size of the

ripple indicated that the limit was being approached. That the dissi-

milarity in tauk F was only the result of a phase in the formation of the
estuarj was also definitely shown by the effects of dredging out the sand,

which was above the initial level in the river during the early stages of

the Experiments V. and YI., after which the action in tank F resumed

the same coui'se as that in E, and led to the same final condition of
equilibrium, showing by the rate of action and size of ripple that the
limit of similarity was approached.

      It thus appears that with such arrangements as these tanks represent
there are two possible conditions of final equilibrium.

     The one is that which has uniformly been presented by tank E, and

in Experiment V. in tank F after dredging ; namely, the tide rising up to

the top of the river and keeping the sand low in the estuary. The other,

that which was presented in Experiments I., II., III., and IV., in ta.nk F

namely, the sand at the top of the estuary rising to high water level, as it
would do if there were no river, choking the mouth of the river except

so fixr as necessary to allow the land water to pass, and so preventing any

tidal action from the river.
     Which of these two conditions the river will assume during the process

of forming the estuary appears to be a critical matter, decided by whether

the tidal action of the river in lowering the sand at the head of the estuary
predominates over the tendency of the tide in the estuary to raise the
sand at the mouth of the river.

There is a possible condition of instability between the river and the

«stuary. The emphatic difference in the action of the long tidal river and

mere tidal capacity at the head of the estuary in keeping down the sand

at the  head  of  the  estuary                                     and, further, the very great  effect which an
                                                                ;

increase in the length of the river has on the depth of water in the estuary

and in the river are clearly shown.^ In Experiments III. and V. in tank

E, an increase of from 50 to 70 miles in the length of the river in V.

causing the depth of water to increase from by 40 to 30 feet all down the

river and estuary, lowering the sand in the lower river and upper estuary

from the level of half-tide to 28 feet below low water. In neither of these

experiments was the condition of instability reached, but 50 miles was

very near the limit.

     In such a state any diminution of the upper tidal waters of the river,

"by shm-tening the river or by land reclamation, might well have caused

--the critical stage to be passed and caused the river to silt up ^just as in

the other way the increasing of the tidal capacity high up the river by
dredging in Experiment V., tank F, caused the critical stage of silting
up to be passed and the i-iver to open out. The sand actually removed
in this experiment by dredging was 8 per cent, of the tidal capacity,

        h is the actual rise in feet, e the vertical exaggeration as referred to a 30-foot

tide.

or 400 million cubic yards, removed at the rate of 7 million cubic yards

a year.

   --In most navigable rivers two processes have been going on dredging^
--and land reclamation the first tending greatly to improve the rivers and

estnaries, the second to deteriorate them so that any improvement has
been a question of balance. Where the rivers have improved they vrill
probably continue to improve so long as dredging goes on, but if the
dredging should stop, for example in the Thames, there would in all
probability be a gradual deterioration, possibly ending in the silting up of

the tidal river.

   --6. The effect of Tides deviating from the simple Harmonic Law. One

attempt was made to study this question, when it was found tbat it would

require such modifications in the gearing as were not practicable in the
time, and so it was abandoned.

   --7. The action of Tides varying from Spring to Neap. The rates of

action and conditions of final equilibrium in rectangular tanks, in V-shaped
estuaries with a long tidal river, and in each estuary rendered unsym-
metrical by large groins, have been investigated with tides varying
harmonically from spring to neap, and again to spring in 29 tides. The
ratio of these at spring and neap being 3 to 2 as compared with uniform
tides, having the same rise as the spring tides, also for uniform tides
having the same rise as the mean of spring and neap, the results showing

definitely

      (1) That the condition of Final Equilibrium in all cases ivith sprinrj and
neap tides xoas the same as that with miiforin tides having the same rise as
springs, and much greater, cssentialh/ different, from that ivith a uniform
tide having a rise equal to the mean rise of spring and neap tides.

     (2) That the Rate of Action loith the varying tide is much smaller than
that of a uniform tide having the rise of the spring tide. The ratios being

definite, abotd2'^ to 1.

       (3) Tliat the limits of similarity obtained for all spring tides hold
approximately for tides varying from spring to neap.

      8. The effects of prolonging the rivers into the estnaries by walls below-

high ivater. Experiments V. in tanks E and F having arrived at

similar final conditions of equilibrium (in which the depth of the rivers
for some distance above their mouths was reduced to a 30-foot tide, nearly
 30 feet at low water, while the sand in the estuaries gradually rose from
the mouths of the rivers until it reached to witbin 12 feet of low water at
 a distance of 14 miles below the mouth and then fell again, all the sand
 being below this level, there being passes which formed a crooked deep
 water channel), opportunity was taken to prolong the banks of the river
 by walls at first up to low water and extending through the bar to a
 distance of 44 miles from the mouths of the rivers. Then raising these
 walls to half-tide, and finally carrying the walls forward slowly in tank

E at a rate of half a mile a year (700 tides), and in tank F dredging from

 between the walls at a rate of seven million cubic yards a year (700 tides).
      This was done in the first place as a further test of the similarity of

 the action in the two tanks, and secondly as affording an interesting-

 study as to the effect of vertical walls in the direction of the current in
 the bed of a tide-way. The effect of these walls at the level of low water
 and at half tide were precisely similar in both tanks ; in neither case did
 they produce any sensible effect at all on the level of the sand between

 them. At the level of half- tide they caused in both tanks a slight silting-
ON THK ACTION OF WAVES AND CUUUENXS.  391

up oiitside the walls and also a slight silting up in the river above its
mouth, which effects were very much increased when the walls were

raised to half-tide. On the walls being removed in tank E and then

gradually carried forward, the silting up behind the wall and deteriora-
tion of the river increased, but there was no improvement in navigable
depth between the walls.

     The dredging in tank F, so long as it was continued, added about 20
feet on a 30-foot tide or 10 feet on a 15-foot tide, to the navigable depth
between the walls, but there was the same silting up behind the walls
and the same deterioration in the river.

      It thus appears that the similarity of the results in both tanks

supports the conclusion that vertical zvalls having the horizontal direction
of the current in a straight tideway and terminating ivell below high luater,
produce hut little effect on the distrihution of the sand between them, so long
as the passage is freely open at both ends, but that if the passage be blocJced
at one end they form a bay in luhich the sand rises at the head.

   --9. The effects of the tide in estuaries not symmetrical. Having so far,

in accordance with the original scheme of this investigation (First Report,
1889, p. 5), simplified the circumstances which influence the distribu-
tion of sand by maintaining the lateral boundaries perfectly sym-
metrical, and as nearly rectilinear as practicable, and haA'ing found
definite laws connecting the distributions of sand in the beds of the model
estuaries with the period and rise of the tide and the length of the

estuary, besides the laws connecting the period of the tide with the
horizontal and vertical scales under whicli the models give similar results,
there remained two questions :

     (1) How far such discrepancies as appear between the general distri-

butions of sand found in the models and those observed in actual estuaries

are attributable to irregularities in the boundaries of the latter ?

    (2) How far the influence of these boundaries is subject to the same

laws of similarity as those already obtained ?
     The original experiments of the author in models of the Mersey which

led to the appointment of the Committee (B.A. Report, 1887) had to a
great extent answered these questions, showing that similar irregulari-
ties in the lateral boundaries exercise similar and predominating influences
on the lateral distributions of the sand in the models and in the estuaries.

      It seemed, however, desirable, so far as time allowed, to confirm these

results of the author's and make this investigation complete in itself by
carrying out experiments in both models similar to those already carried

out, except that the boundaries should be boldly irregular.
      Such experiments also afforded opportunity for studying some general

effects of great importance. The relation between the depths of water
and the rise of tide had come out very definite in the symmetrical experi-
 ments, and it was desirable to see how far these relations would be
 disturbed by lateral irregidarities. For instance: (1) Would bold irregu-
 larities in the bounda^'ies of the estuary alter the depth of water in the
 river ? Bold irregularities in the boundaries, causing the water to take a
 sinuous course, would have the effect of virtually narrowing and in-
 creasing the length of the estuary, and by causing eddies would obstruct
 the passage of the water to some extent. Lengthening the estuary would
 tend to increase its depth at corresponding points, and obstructing the
 ·water would tend to diminish the tidal action in the river ; at all events,
 until the estuary had increased in depth.
392 REPORT-- 1891.

     (2) At the mouth of the estnary the flow of water had so far been
straight up and down, and equal all across the estuary. By rendering
the mouth unsymmetrical, circulation would be set up which would render
the up-currents stronger at one part and the down-currents stronger at
another, an efi'ect which would correspond to some extent to that of tidal
currents across the mouth of the estuary.

      (3) The large tidal sand ripples below low water in the model estuaries,
with the flood and .ebb taking the same course, constitute a feature which
it is impossible to overlook, yet the existence of corresponding ripples
had been entirely overlooked in actual estuaries until they were found to
exist when they were looked for, having been first seen in the models.
The reason that they were overlooked before is, no doubt, explained by
the fact that the bottom is not visible below low water in actual estuaries

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

but this is not all. In the estuaries these ripples, where found, have been
confined to the bottoms and sides of the narrow channels between high
sand banks, and they do not occur on the level sands below low water
towards the mouths of estuaries to anything like the same extent as in

the models. By rendering the estnary unsymmetrical and so causing the

ebb and flood to take diSerent courses, this effect, as explaining the
greater prevalence of ripples with symmetrical estuaries, would be tested.

      These considerations led to the repetition of Experinipnt V. in tank F,
at first with a single groin extending from the right bank into the middle
 of the estuary at the mouth, and subsequently to the introduction of
.three more groins from alternate sides of the estuary to the middle, up
 the estuary, and then to the introduction of similar groins into tank E,
during Experiment VII., with spring and neap tides.

      The result of these experiments is to show conclusively :
      (1) That the laius of similarity found for symmetrical channels v:ith

uniform tides hold with sinuous channels for uniform or varying tides.
       (2) That the greater uniformity of the depth of sand on cross sections of

 models tvith symmetrical boundaries than toith actual estuaries, does not
·exist when the hanlcs are equally irregular.

      (3) That the circulation caused by the unequal flow of the tide in model
estuaries tends greatly totalce the snndout, and that the natural tendency in

·an estuary to scarp the boundaries so as to increase its sinuosities tends

(jreatly to the deepiening of the channels.
       (4) Tliat in the models ivith boldly irregular boundaries the tidal ripples

are much less frequent than in the symmetrical models, being confined to

places ivliere there are n.n cross currents, as in actual estuaries.

    --10. Conclusion of the Investigation. It seems that the objects of this

investigation have now been accomplished.
     The investigation of the action of tides on the beds of model estuaries

has been found peifectly practicable. Two tanks have been kept running

night and day from June 22, 1889, to August 1891, and have each ac-
complished upwards of 1,200,000 tides, representing the experience of
2,000 years. Such difliculties as protecting the sand from extraneous
disturbance and keeping it free from fouling, regulating the levels of the
water, the tidal periods, the rise of tide, forms of the tide cui-ve and the
supply of land water, observing and recording the I'esults, have all been
fairly overcome, though none of the precautions taken could have been

safely dispensed with.

     The limits to the conditions under which the results will conform to
the simple hydrokinetic law of similarity have been fairly established

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          j
ON THE ACTION OF WAVES AND CL'RUKMS.  393

while above these limits the applicability of the simple hydrokinetic law
to these experiments has been abundantly verified in models varying in
scale from six inches to a mile to an inch and a half to the mile, and with
vertical exaggerations, as compared with a 80-foot tide, ranging from 60

to 100.

     The laws of the distribution of the sand in a tideway under circum-
stances of progressing complexity have been determined and have been
verified, not only by repetitions of the same experiment but also by pro-
ducing similar distributions under different circumstances, which circum-
stances, however, conformed to the laws of hydrokinetic similarity.
Thus the distributions of sand in simple rectangular estuaries, V-shaped
estuaries, and V-shaped estuaries with a long tidal river, have all been
investigated and found to be definite.

     Investigations have also been made with definite results of the separate
effects of land water in moderate quantities, and of the length of the
tidal river on the depth of water in the river and estuary, and of the

effect of bold irregularities in the configuration of the lateral boundaries
of the estuaries, also of training walls in deep water. And, lastly, the
comparative rates and ultimate action of uniform tides and tide varying
from spring to neap have been determined.

     It thus appears that this system of investigation has been tested over
a great portion of the ground it is likely to cover, and that most of the
difficulties that are likely to occur have been met and the necessary pre-

cautions found.

     It would seem, therefore, by carefully observing these precautions, the

method may now be applied with confidence to practical problems.

                                 § III.--The Appar.vius.

  --11. General Woi-ling of the Apparatus. All the apparatus has worked

well, although certain repairs have been rendered necessary by wear ; thiis,
the motor has required new pins, not much, considering it has made over
200 million revolutions. The knife edges, on which the generator of the
large tank rests, which are of cast-iron, and 2 inches long, and each carry
about 1,000 lb., were found to have, after one million oscillations, worn

^down of an inch, until they had become so locked in the Vs as to stop

the motor.

      12. The viodificatioiis in the Tanks have this year been confined to the
introduction of ti-aining walls and groins. These have been made of paper
saturated with solid paraSin (which gradually became warped by the
pressure), sheet ziuc, and sheet lead or wood, as was most convenient. In
the last experiment the large tank was modified by taking out the parti-
tion boards and stopping the opening at the end so as to reproduce the

original rectangular tank A.

  --13. Gearing for the Spifing and Neap Tides, Plate II. This arrangement,

designed by Mr. Greenshields, accomplished the result very neatly and
effectually with a minimum of new appliances. It admits of any degree

of adjustment in the ratio of maximum and minimum tides, and works

easily and well.

    On commencing the work with spring and neap tides it was found

essential to have an indicator of the phase of the tide, which would be
easily visible without having to examine the gearing. For this a counter,
having twenty-nine teeth in the escapement wheel, which carried a long

finger over the face, was constracted by Mr. Greensliields, and worked
well, proving a great convenience.

§ lY. Description of the Experiments on the Movement op Sand

IN A Tideway, from September 4, 1890, to August 1891.

E --14. JExperiment III., Plan 1, Tanls
              and F, Plate V. These

experiments were intended as a repetition of Experiments I. (Second

Report, p. 528), which were only continued to 36,000 tides. The only

difference in the conditions being that, while in Experiment I. the sand

was initially laid up to the top of the river, Section 38, in Experiment III,

the sand was only laid up the river to Section 13. These experiments

were carried on during the vacation, Mr. Foster kindly keeping the tanks

running and reading the counters daily. In this way 47,000 tides were

ran in tank E, and 66,000 in F, when the surveys for Plan 1 were taken.

These surveys show a rather more advanced state than is shown in

Plan 2, Experiment I., but they present exactly the same characters.

In tank E the sand in the estuary is slightly lower in the longer experi-

ment than in the shorter, but shows the same distribution. In both

experiments in tank E the level of the sand at the mouth of the river is

that of mean tide, and in both experiments the level of the sand reaches
the H.W.L. in the generator at Section 11, or 13 miles up from the mouth,

and in both the tide continued to rise to the top of the river.
     In tank F, also, both experiments show the same general distribution

of sand in the estuaries and river. In the estuary the phenomenon pre-
viously observed with a low value for the criterion, namely, the large
ripple, is more pronounced in the longer experiment ; bat in both
experiments the river has become barred at an early stage, showing that
the conditions in F during the formation of the estuary have been below

those essential for similarity.

     The rise of tide observed at the end of the Experiment III. in both

E and F is below those observed at the earlier stages. In tank E the

rise of tide with the same rise in the generator has fallen to 0"125 foot at

47° tides, though it was 0-140 foot at 32,000, and 0-095 foot at 60,000 in F,
against 0-096 foot at 32,000. This phenomenon, which becomes more

pronounced in some of the later experiments, is accounted for by the im-

proved tideway as the experiment gets older, allowing the estuary to

empty itself more completely. It requires notice, since it renders esti-
mates, such as the value of the criterion of similarity based upon the rise
of tide, difficult. The same quantity of water passes up and down the
estuary, but does not effect the same rise of tide at the generator, which
falls as the experiment gets older, while the rise of tide up the estuary

increases at the same time.

      15. Experimenfs on Increased Length of Tidal River. Experiments TV.,

E and F, luitli Land Water, Plates VI., X., and IV., October 22 to

November 17, 1890.--The sand laid 0-333 foot in E, and 0-187 in Ffrom
Section 13 up the river to Section 26 down the estuary. Mean rise of

the tide, 0310 in E, 0'197 in F. Rise of the generators the same as

before, periods 33-47 in E, 22-21 in F.

     The conditions were thus the same as in Experiment III., with the

exception that the tidal periods were reduced in the ratio 1 to «/2. As
i*educed to a 30-foot tide, this would have the effect of increasing the

horizontal scales in the ratio v/2 to I. Thus, while in Experiment III.

the estuaries from generator to mouth of tidal river represented about
50 miles, and the rivers 54 miles ; in Experiment IV. the estuaries were

70, and the rivers 76.
    With the same tide at the mouth the elongation of the estuary would

cause the tide to rise higher at the mouth of the river, but as there was
only the same quantity of water from the generator the tides with the
longer estuaries were smaller at the generators, which would again
diminish the tides at the mouths of the rivers. The tides observed at
the mouths of the rivers were somewhat higher than in Experiment III.
And this fact must be allowed for in considering the results as represent-
ing the effect of inci'easing the lengths of the rivers on the distribution

of sand.

In tank E the effect was very remarkable. For the first 5,000 tides

the sand rose up the river as far as it was laid, the head of the sand

gradually going forwai-d, and the sand falling at the top of the estuary

and in the mouth of the river. Somewhat the same appearances

appeared in tank F, though it soon became apparent that the advance of

the head of the sand was much slower in F, and also the lowering of the

sand at the top of the estuary. Sand was going up the river, but it ac-

cumulated in the lower reaches.

In  E     at 9,000  tides there was an almost sudden change                                                                                                                                                                                       the sand  in
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

the river was rapidly carried to the top, leaving the lower reaches empty.

After 11,000 tides the bottom of the river was swept clean from the

mouth to Section 15 (30 miles), and then a steady downward movement

of the sand went on all down the estuary until there was deep water all

the way down from 10 miles below the head of the river. The clearing

of the bottom of the river of sand evidently increased the action of the

river, increasing greatly the rise of tide.

     In tank F the result was very different ; instead of the sand shifting

suddenly up the river, the sar.d reached Section 15, and then barred the
river at Section 11, the river then gradually filling up. At 38,000 tides,
when the second survey was made, the tide was still rising at the top of
the river, and the head of the sand still proceeding forwards. The
experiment was continued to 81,000 tides, and the head of the sand
reached Section 19, the tide still rising at the head very slightly. This
shows that the conditions of similarity were more nearly fulfilled in the

river in tank F in this experiment than in III. The values of the

criterion, however, given in the table are lower in IV. than in III. This

is because these values are calculated from the rise in the generators

which were in these experiments O'llO in tank E and 0081 in F, against
0125 and 095 in Experiments III. With the same water going out

of the generator there mast have been higher tides at the mouths of
the rivers in IV., and as the vertical exaggeration in Experiment IV.

waSs/2 times larger than in I. and III., assuming the rise of tide in tanks

E and F, Experiments III. and IV., to be as in Experiments I., the values

of the criterion in Experiments IV. would be at least 0'261 and 0-103.
This is in accordance v/ith the observed results.

     It seems therefore that in order to apply the criterion to the condi-

tions of similarity at the top of a long estuary with a tidal river the
actual rise of the tide at the mouth of the river should be taken in
estimating the value of the criterion for similarity ai these points. It
appears however that in no case has the criterion estimated from
the tides in the generator exceeded the value '09, but what the condi-
39 G EEPORT-- 1891.

tions of similarity have been fulfilled, while in no case has it fallen
decidedly below this value without decided symptoms of dissimilarity

having appeared, so that this value ibr the criterion seems to be esta-
blished as a good working rule for the formation of an estuary from

sand at the level of half-tide.
     If the bottom of the estuary is modelled the case is diflFerent, but the

occurrence of large ripples, in experiments in tank F and in Experiment V.
in tank E, when the value of the criterion fell as low as '08, shows that
the similarity of the ripple depends on the same value of the criterion as

the formation of the estuary.

  --16. Experimenta ivith Limitivg Value of Criterion. Experiment Y.

tuithLand Water, Tank E, Plates VIF., VIII., and XL, from November 20 to
December 24.^The conditions of this experiment were designed to bring

the value of the criterion, estimated from the rise of tide in the generator

in the final condition of equilibrium, to 0'09, keeping the horizontal scale

as nearly as possible the same as in IV., and diminishing the rise of tide so

as to increase the proportional depth of sand in the river, and thus pre-

vent the bottom being swept clean when the final condition was reached.

The length of the crank working the generator in IV. had been 4'437

inches                                this was reduced  to  377 inches in V.. reducing  the  rise  of  the
                                   ;

tide in the ratio 0'85. To keep the horizontal scale the same the period

33'3 seconds was increased to 36 seconds, leaving the product;; \//t constant.
     This reduced the vertical exaggeration e in the ratio 0"85. Thus the

value of h^e is reduced (0'85)^ or 0'5'2.

    Now the value of the criterion in Experiment IV. just before the

bottom was swept with sand was greater than 0'18, which, multiplied by
0-52, gives 0093.

     As carried out at the final condition shown in Plan 3, Plate VIII., the
period was 35'6 seconds, the rise of tide 0'107, and the value of the
criterion 00912.

     This low value of the criterion showed itself in the rate of progress of
the experiment. It was 13,000 tides before the sand in the river reached
Section 19, against 4,000 in Experiment IV., and 25,000 against 9,000 in
xV. before reaching the head of the river. In the early stage of the ex-
periment it seemed doubtful whether the sand was going to bar the river
as in Experiment IV., tank F. Except in rate of action, however, the
motion of the sand followed the same course as in Experiment IV., taking
a sudden shift at about 20,000 tides, and then rapidly lowering the sand
at the head of the estuary. At the mouth of the river the bottom of the
tank was reached after 50,000 tides, but only between the ripple bars, so
that it was not swept clean.

    The ripples in this experiment were very much larger than anything
before in tank E, showing that the criterion was approaching its critical

value.

     The final condition of the estuary, as shown in Plan 3, after 36,000
tides, shows conclusively the effect of the upper tidal water in a long
river on the bed of the lower estuary. Below Section 19, 32 miles from
the top of the river, there is no sand above the level of low water in the
estuary, and from this the sand falls uniformly to the mouth of the river,
where there is a depth of water, at low tide, of 30 feet. In the head of
the estuary there is a bar the top of which is only 12 feet below low
water ; this is at Section 9, or 18 miles below the mouth of the river
below this point the sand gradually falls to the generator.
ON THE ACTION OF WAVES AND CUKKENTS.  397

     Comparing tliis with the results in Experiments I. and III., where the
reduced length of the river is only some 50 miles, but in which the rise of
tide at tbe mouth of the river was somewhat greater, the effect of the
extra 20 miles length in the river is seen to have improved the general
and navigable deptb of the river and estuary from the top of the river to
a distance of 40 miles down the estuary by from 40 to 30 feet.

     17. The efeds of dredging in the river, Experiment V., in Tank F, from

November 19 to December 23, 1890, Plan 3, Plate VIIL-- The initial con-

ditions of this experiment were the same as those of Experiment IV. in
tank F, except that the mean level of the tide was raised to 0-016 above
the initial level of the sand, and the period was increased from 22 to 23-3

seconds. The experiment was undertaken with the intention of ascertain-
ing (1) whether raising the mean level of the tide above the initial level
of the sand without altering the rise of tide would prevent the river
becoming barred : and, supposing thia did not succeed, (2) to ascertain
whether, if the bar which had hitherto formed in the river during the
early stages of the experiments in tank F were kept down by dredging-
out the sand as it rose above the initial level, the later stages would

follow the same course as in tank E.
      The results were remarkable, and bring out the critical character of

the conditions at the mouth of the river.
     The experiment was allowed to run 30,000 tides, during which the

progress of the sand was much more rapid than in IV., reaching Section 19
in (5,000 tides, as against 36,000 in Experiment IV. and 13,000 in Experi-
ment E, v., and reaching Section 23 in 16,000. At this point it stuck,
and the sand accumulated at the head of the estuary and in the river,

which became barred at Section 19, on reaching 30,000 tides.
      It thus appears that lowering the initial level of the sand produced an

 effect on the first action very nearly equal to increasing the rise of tide

by double the amount, but that as the sand distributed itself this effect

passed off.

      At 30,000 tides the bar in the river was dredged down to the initial
 level of the sand, and this level was maintained by daily dredging till
 70,000 tides had been run, 0-08 cubic foot of sand in all being removed.

      At this stage the sand in the river suddenly shifted up to the top as in
 Experiments IV. and V., E. The sand at the mouth of the river and top
 of the estuary falling until the bottom appeared, dredging was discon-
 tinued. At 95,000 tides the final condition had been reached, which was

 almost identical over the whole estuary with that of Experiment V. E
 after 60,000 tides, as shown in Plan 3, Experiment V., E and F.

      The instability of the condition which may prevail at the mouth of a

  river is thus clearly shown, as well as the useful effect of improving the
  tideway by dredging in the upper reaches in the river. In three
 experiments in tank F, I., III., and IV., the river became completely
 barred, and the estuary became a bay with a stream of land water
  entering at its top ; in Experiment V. the bar again formed, but on being
 kept down by di-edging to the level of half-tide till the sand had fallen at
  the head of the estuary, the river at length prevailed, and the sand was

  washed out till there was 30 feet of water at low tide.
       The time and amount of sand removed in producing this effect were

  considerable. The tidal capacity of the river and estuary is 1 cubic foot
  this reduced to a 30-foot tide is 21,700 million cubic yards, or on a 15-

  foot tide is 5,422 million The amount of dredging, O'OS cubic foot in
398 EEPOET-- 1891.

all, represents 1,743 million cubic yards on a 80-foot tide, or 437 million
on a 15-foot tide. This was distributed over 40,000 tides, or sixty years,
so that even with, the 15-foot tide it would represent 7 million cubic

yards a year.
     After the dredging the rise of tide fell from -081 to "073 foot, which

would result from the lowering the sand which was above low water.
      18. Experiments with Training Walls. Experiment V. (continued) with

ETraining Walls, Tanlcs and F, from January 7 to Fehruarij 20, 1891.

--Fla7i 4, Plate XII. Having arrived at similar^^nal conditions of equili-

brium in tanks E and F, in which the sand was entirely below low

--water from Section 19 up the rivers (32 miles from the top of the

river) to the generators, and in which there were bars in the estuary
below the mouths of the rivers, reducing the depth of water at low tide
from 28 feet in the river to a minimum of 12 on the top of the bars, it
seemed an opportunity not to be lost for testing the similarity of the
effect in the two tanks of prolonging the rivers by training walls through

the bars.

     With this view walls of thick paper saturated with paraffin pushed
vertically into the sand and extending up to low water were run out
from the end of the river, preserving the same divergence as the walls of
the river to Section 22, or 40 miles on a 30-foot tide, the tanks being

stopped for the purpose.
      These walls produced no apparent effect whatever on the depth of

sand between the walls, during 20,000 or 30,000 tides. They were then
replaced at the upper end by walls of sheet zinc extending to half-tide,
which did produce an apparent effect, inasmuch as the sand accumulated
outside the walls, forming an apparent channel within; also the sand rose
in the river, doing away with the appearance of a bar. These effects
were similar in both models after 40,000 tides had been run.

     The old walls were removed in both tanks and replaced by walls
commencing at | tide at the mouths of the rivers, and falling during
the first 4 or 5 miles to half-tide, at which they were continued to

Section 22.

    In tank E the walls were advanced gradually from the mouth of the

river at a rate of about half a mile in 700 tides (year). The result of this
is shown in Plan 4, Plate XII., tank E. There is no improvement in
the navigable depth of the river.

    In tank F the walls were put in and then the tops of the ripple bars

were daily dredged off between the walls. This was continued for
100,000 tides, during which 5 per cent, of the tidal capacity was
removed, or about 1,000 million cubic yards on a 30-foot tide, or 250
millions on a 15-foot tide, which represents 7 millions annually on the
30-foot tide, or 1'8 millions on a 15-foot tide. The effect, as shown in
Plan 4, tank F, Plate XII., is to add some 20 feet to the depth on a 30-
foot tide, or 10 feet on a 15-foot tide.

     The silting up behind the walls is the same as in tank E, and the
detriment to the navigable depth of the river is also similar.

     19. Experiment V. {continued) with Tide deviatingfrom the Simple Har-

--monic in Tank E, Fehruary 23 to March 12. This was meant as a pre-

liminary experiment. The balance of the generator was altered to give
a rise of tide in 17 seconds and a fall in 20. The experiment was run
for about 40,000 tides, and a survey taken, which showed little or no
effect. On carefully examining the tide curves it was found that they
ON THE ACTION OF WAVES AND CDKRENTS.                             399

showed very little inequality in the rise and fall. On attempting to

increase this by farther altering the balance, it was found that this could
not be done. To continue this part of the investigation it would have been
necessary to introduce complex gearing. Time did not suffice for this,
and the study was not carried further.

     20. Experiments loith Tides varying from Spring to Neap, Tank E,

--v., VI., VIL, rilL, Tanl: A, XIII. ^Plates X., XL, XII., and XIV.,

March 20 to August, 1891. The gearing for tank E having been modified

so as to cause a rise in the generator, varying to over an interval of
29 tides, the variation being harmonic and adjustable, so as to admit of

any relation between the maximum and minimum rise.
     These were adjusted so that the mean rise was the same as the rise in

AExperiment V., the spring and neap rises being in the ratio 3 to 2.

drain with an adjustable orifice was put in the bottom of the tank to
drain off neai'ly all the fresh water, and the scummer adjusted so as to

draw off the excess of land water at low spring tide level ; this being
adjusted by trial until when running the mean tide level was the same as

before.

      Experiment V. was then restarted without the sand having been

disturbed to afford a preliminary trial of the apparatus, the period
being that of Experiment V., 36 seconds. This was continued 18,000
tides, till the apparatus was completely in hand ; then the sand was
relaid for Experiment VI., Plan 2, Plate X., in which the conditions

were the same as V., except the tide. The mean rise in the generator was
the same in VI. as in V., and the ratio of the spring and neaps 3 to 2.
This brought the rise in the generator at spring tides in VI. greater than
that in Experiment IV., in the ratio of 1"1 to 1. The action on the sand

was miich more rapid than in Experiment V. with the uniform tide being
nearly as quick as in IV. The sand reaching the top of the river in
 13,000 tides, as against 10,000 in IV. and 25,000 in V., and the bottom
of the river being swept as clean in 17,000 tides in VI., as in 14,000 in IV.
 In other respects the action in VI. very closely resembled that in IV.
 The rate of action was a little slower, but the action itself seemed rather

 stronger, as corresponding to a higher tide. Surveys were taken at
20,000 and 34,000 tides. The experiment was then stopped, in order to

Vmake the conditions comparable with those of Experiment ; it being

quite clear that the action of spring and neap tides, having a mean rise
equal to that of a uniform tide, was not only much more rapid, but led to
 a different state of final equilibrium.

   --Experiment VIL, Plan 1, Flate XL. In this the tide was adjusted

 until the rise of the generator at spring tide was the same as that for the

 uniform tide in V., the other conditions being all the same.

     The character of the action now became identical with what it had
 been in Experiment V., but the rate was decidedly slower. Thus the
 sand moving up the river reaches :

are almost identical, the latter being a little the forwardest.
400  EEPOKT 1891.

     It thus appears that spring and neap tides, having a ratio 3 to 2,
prodnce the same result as tivo-fifths the same number of tides all

springs.

     So far neither of these estuaries had reached the condition of final
equilibrium, but the similarity that the Plans 1, Experiments V. and VII.
present seemed sufficient assurance that this would be the same.

     It was intended to repeat Experiment V., tank A, as soon as the
tank had been re-formed to its rectangular shape; in the meantime

groins were introduced in tank E similar to those which had been used
in Experiment VI. F, and Experiment VII. E was continued to ascertain
how far similar effects would be produced by varying and uniform tides

in estuaries with similar but boldly irregular outlines.
     Experiment VII. E, Plan 4, Plate XIII. was continued with groins to

12.3,000 tides. Similar groins had affected the condition of the sand in
the estuary and river in Experiment VI., tank F, so that further com-
parison between Experiments VII. and V. cannot be made.

     Experiment XIII., Tmik A, rectangular without land-water, spring and

--neap tides. Plan 3, Plate VIII, from July 10 to August 10, 1891. In

this experiment the rates of spring and neap tides were 3 to 2, and the
rise of tide at spring tides was 0"176, the same as in Expei'iment V.,
tank A. The tank was reduced to its original rectangular form (Report
I.), namely, 4 feet broad, and 12 feet from the generators to the top.
The sand was laid as in Experiment V., tank A, at a depth of 2 in. from
Section 18 to the top of the tank, and the mean tide was adjusted as
in Experiment V., tank A. The period was 50 seconds, as in tank A.
Thus the conditions of Experiment XIII. and V., tank A, were precisely
the same, with the exception that while the tides in Experiment V. were
all springs, those in Experiment XIII. varied from springs to neap ; the
object of Experiment XIII. being to compare the rate of action and final
condition of equilibrium with varying tides with the very definite results
obtained as to the slopes of the sand obtained in the rectangular tanks
and recorded in Report I., B.A. Report, 1889.

     These results are shown on Plate VIII. The period in Experiment
XIII., tank A, being shorter than in V. The actual slope is greater but
the slopes reduced to a 30-foot tide agree.

      21. Experiments on Estuaries not Symmetrical. Experiment VI., in

--Tank F, with large groins, Plans I and 4, Plates XII. and XIII., from

April 8 to June 16. This experiment was started under conditions in all
respects similar to those in Experiment V., tank F, with the exception of
a vertical groin extending from the right bank to the middle of the
estuary, with an inclination of 45° towards the generator, and rising from
the bottom of the tank above high water. This groin, which appears in
the charts to represent an artificial structure, is, in fact, out of all
proportion to anything of that kind which has yet been attempted. As
reduced to a 30-foot tide, it is 11 miles long, 100 feet high up to H.W.L.,
and half a mile broad. Thus it corresponds rather to such a natural
feature as Spurn Head, at the mouth of the Humber, than to a break-
water such as that at Harwich.

      In starting the experiment, the end of the sand at Section 26 was 20
miles above the point of the groin at Section 36. The groin had deep
water on both sides of it, so that its only effect was to deflect the flood
on to the left bank of the estuary.

      This effect was very decided, the strength of the flood on the right
                                                                 ON THE ACTION OF WAVES AND CURRENTS.                                                  401

carrying the sand up the estuary in spite of the effect of the ebb to brincr

it down.  But                                                    this  in  itself  was  not  so  much                              it was  the  large  eddy
                                                                                                                                ;

caused by the groin which produced the greatest effect. The water

entering on the left of the estuary crossed over to the right, and re-

turned along the right bank. In other words, during flood the right side

of the estuary for 30 miles from the generator was in back water. This

back water also gave the ebb a start down the right bank which rendered

the ebb stronger on this side.

     The sand came down rapidly on the right side, and besides was carried
over from the left to the right, and formed a bank along the right middle
of the estuary, reaching the generator after a very few tides. Round this
hank the water circulated, carrying the sand with it up on the left and
down on the right, the bank growing all the time. The ripple round this
bank was very striking, arranged with the ripple heads all down on the-
right side and up on the left. After about 3,000 tides the sand began to

pass from the point of this bar in a fine stream aci'oss the open channel,
dividing this point from the point of the groin, and commenced the

formation of a bank in the generator corresponding to that in the tank.
This bank had to be removed from the generator, and after 6,000 tides
4 lbs, of sand were so removed. In Experiment V. the first sand removed
from the generator was after 120,000 tides had been run.

     The sand also went more rapidly up the river in Experiment VI.
than in Experiment V. But this was accounted for by dredging in
the river having begun much earlier, after 20,000 tides as against

30,000.

     In all 8 lbs. of sand were removed from the river in Experiment VI.,,
against 10 lbs. in V., or about 0-004 of the tidal capacity in VI. against

008 in V. In both cases the dredging stopped when the sand began to

shift up the river after 70,000 tides.

At 100,000 tides a condition of final equilibrium had been arrived at.

The sand in the river was just the same as in V., Plan 3, Experiments V.

and VI. in tank F. There is deep water in VI. up to Section 21, 30 miles

from the generator, the levels of the sand being much the same from this

point up as in V.

   A similar groin was then introduced at Section 16, extending from the

left bank to the middle of the estuary. This groin was 4^ miles long and

100 feet high to H.W.L., and 50,000 more tides were run, the river all the

time slightly improving. Thus having brought deep water up to Section

14, or about 44 miles from the generator, a groin extending from the right

bank to mid-channel at Section 8, about 25 miles long and 70 feet high,

and another from the left bank to mid-channel at Section 5, 2 miles long

and 70 feet high, were put in.

Thefirsteffect of these groins was to raise the sand slightly in the mouth

of the river                                                     but this  improved again,   and  after                            50,000  more tides thero
                                                              ;

was deep water extending from the mouth of the river to the generator,

and the river was better than in Experiment V. with the training walls,
though not quite so good as before these were put in.

     In the meantime the banks had risen in the estuary below the groins,
extending down from nearly H.W.L. to the point of the next groin,

whei-e there was a pass with water nearly to the bottom of the tank.
    The sand carried down into the generator during the expei'iment

amounted to 69 lbs., or 57 per cent, of the tidal capacity. In Experiment
V. 24 lbs. were removed in like manner, or 20 per cent, of the tidal capa-

city. 37 per cent, of the tidal capacity on a 30-foot tide would represent
a mean increase of depth over the entire estnary of 11 feet; and as the
increase was by no means over the whole estnary, the increase in the

channels and lower estuary was much more than this, and although by
this time the sand in the estuary had for the most part become quite
yellow, sand was still being carried down into the generator.

      In the meantime, as already stated, groins similar to those in Experi-
ment VI. in tank F, had been introduced into experiment VII. in tank E,
after 64,000 tides had been I'un with spring and neap tides. 60,000 more
tides, which would be equivalent to about 27,000 spring tides, were run,
the effect being that, notwithstanding the difference in the initial condi-
tions, the state of the lower estuary was closely approximating to the

state of VI. in F after 36,000 tides (Plan 2, Experiment VII., tank
E; VI., tank F).

      In the upper estuary in VII., tank E, the distribution of the sand is
precisely similar to that in VI., tank F, but there is rather more of it,
which is explained partly by the fact of the difference in the equivalent

tides run, 30,000 in E as against 60,000 in F, after the upper groins were
put in, and partly by the much greater amount of sand still left in the
lower estuary in tank E. Had it been possible to run 250,000 more

spring and neap tides in VII., tank E, there is every reason to suppose
the final condition would have been precisely similar to that obtained in
Experiment VI. in tank F.

Report of the Comvnittee, consisting of Professor Flower (Chair-
     man)^ Dr. Garson [Secretary), Dr. Beddoe, Greneral Pitt-Rivers,
     Mr. Francis Galton, and Dr. E. B. Tylor, appointed for the
     purpose of editing a new Edition of ' Anthropological Notes
     and Queries.'

The Committee has to report that during the past year material progress
has been made in the work of editing the new edition of ' Anthropological
Notes and Queries.' The whole of the work is now in the press, and so
far advanced that it has been possible to present an advanced copy to the

Association along with this report,

     The editors are of opinion that the value of the work would be

--enhanced by the addition of some additional illustrations to the first

part Anthropography.
     The Committee considers the plate illustrating the colour of eyes, hair,

-- --and skin also submitted to the Association a decided advance upon any-

thing that has been hitherto done in that way, and has every confidence
that if a further sum is placed at the disposal of the editors for illustra-
tions it will be spent to the best advantage.

     The Committee request to be reappointed, and that a further sum of

20^. be placed at its disposal for illustrations.
     The Committee in conclusion reports that best thanks are due to the

Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland (under the
auspices of which body the work is being edited) for undertaking

Association.

Report of the Committee, consistiyig of Vrofessov Flower (Chairman),
    Dr. Garson {Secretary), Mr.BLOXAM, and Dr. AVilberforce Smith,
    for the purpose of carrying on the tuork of the Anthropometric
    Laboratory. {Drawn up by Dr. Garsox, Secretary.)

The Committee has to report that at the Leeds meeting of the Associa-
tion last" year excellent accommodation near the reception room was

provided by the Local Committee for the anthropometric laboratory.
The services of a clerk were, as previously, placed at the disposal of the
officers of the Anthropological Section, under whose supervision the

work of the laboratory was carried on. By the kind permission of

Mr. Francis Gal ton, F.R.S., the services of the superintendent of his
laboratory at South Kensington, Sergeant Randall, were again available

to carry on the work of the Association laboratory.

The measurements and observations made in the laboratory were the

same as last year, except that the length of the hand was substituted for
that of the middle finger, and the form of the profile of the nose was

added. They consisted of the age, sex, birthplace, colour of eyes, hair;

profile  of  nose ;  height  when  sitting,  kneeling, and  standing                                           vertical
                                                                                                            ;

distance from vertex to tragus, mouth, and chin; length and breadth of

head ; length and breadth of nose ; length and breadth of face (nasio-
mental and bizygomatic respectively) ; length of cubit and of hand;

span of arms across the back ; weight in ordinary clothing; strength of

pull with each hand; vital capacity of lungs; strength of vision with
each eye, and sense of colour ; and in males the maximum and minimum
Acircumference of the chest during inspiration and expiration.
                                                                duplicate

form of these observations was handed to each person who was measured.

The total number of persons measured was 135, of these 95 were males
and 40 were females. The number of applicants for measurement was

greatly in excess of those who could be measured, so that with a larger

staff of assistants in the laboratory many more observations could have

been obtained.

    The Committee acknowledges with thanks the use of Stanley , s new
medical spirometer for testing the breathing capacity, which was kindly
placed at its disposal by the manufacturer, Mr. H. T. Tallack, of 28 Hatton
Garden, London. After some preliminary comparison of results obtamed
from Hutchinson and Lowne's spirometers and those of the new instru-

ment, it was resolved to use the latter exclusively during the meeting.

The experience gained from its use last year was so satisfactory that the

Committee has arranged, by the kindness of the manufacturer, to use it
again this year. The statistics of the observations made at the Leeds
meeting have been worked up during the year after the manner adopted

in the last two reports. The work of amalgamating the whole of the

statistics of observations made at meetings of the Association is being
proceeded with each year with a view, as soon as a sufficient number of
--406 REPORT 1891.

statistics have been obtained, to publisbing the results in a more compre-
hensive form. It is also contemplated, when a sufficient number of cases
have been obtained, to publish the proportions of the different parts of the

body.

     The measurements have hitherto been made as far as possible accord-
ing to the metric system, that being by far the most convenient and
universal form of measurement. As, however, many persons measured at
the laboratory ask what the equivalent in English measurement is of these
measurements a table has been drawn up which it is hoped will be of
assistance to those who have not yet made themselves familiar with the
more universal system of weights and measures.

    Metrical Measurements and their equivalents in inches and half-inches.

Seventh Repoi^t of the Committee, consisting of Dr. E. B. Tylor,

    Mr. Gr. W. Bloxam, Sir Daniel Wilson, Dr. Gr. M. Dawson,
    and Mr, R. Gr. Haliburton, appointed to investigate the
    physical characters, languages, and iiulustrial and social
    condition of the North-Western Tribes of the Dominion of

     Canada.

                          iNTEODrCTION BY SiK DaNIEL WiLSON.

The report here presented is again the result of the work of Dr. Franz

Boas in the interesting ethnological field of British Columbia. It con-
sists of two parts, the first being devoted to the Bilqula, a people inhabit-

ing a limited tract in the vicinity of Dean Inlet and Bentinck Arms, the

second dealing with the physical characteristics of the tribes of the North-

west Coast region.
     In connection with the Bilqula it is important to note that they, by

reason of their position, have held the most important natural pass and
trade route through the Coast Range, from the ocean to the interior,
which exists between the Skeena River and the Eraser, a distance exceed-
ing 400 miles. This circumstance has rendered their situation a peculiarly
favourable one in some respects. It has induced them to engage in
intertribal trade, and evidently also affords a clue to some of the peculiari-
ties which Dr. Boas points out. From time immemorial, as the writer ia
informed by Dr. Dawson, who has geologically examined that part of the
country, a route has been beaten out by way of the Bella Coola River,
 thence northward to the Salmon River, and then along the north side of
the Blackwater River to the Upper Fraser. This is commonly known by
 the Tinneh of the interior as the ' Grease Trail,' from the fact that the
 chief article of value received from the coast in early times was the oil of
 the olachen or candle-fish, though dentalium shells and other things

were also brought in. When trading vessels began to visit the coast,

 besides the natural products of the sea, iron and various kinds of manu-
 factured goods found their way into the interior by the same route
 while the fine furs of the inland region were carried back to the coast
 and sold to the vessels. It was by this same route, well known to the
 natives, that Sir Alexander Mackenzie was enabled to complete the first
 traverse of the North American continent from sea to sea and to reach
408 EEPORT-- 1891.

the shore of the Pacific in 1793. As a result of this iutercommunication
between the Bilqula and Tinneh it is found that houses essentially similar
to those of the Coast Indians in mode of construction and ornamentation,
though smaller and less skilfully built, occur far inland on the upper
waters of the Salmon and Blackwater Rivers ; while, on the other hand, the
practical identity of some points in the mythology of the Bilqula with
that of the Tinneh of the interior is a clear instance of reciprocal

influence.

     The second part of the report will be found to contain the most com-
plete series thus far obtained of anthropological measurements relating to
the tribes of the North- West Coast, with a discussion by the author of the
data which these afford, in which several points of value are brought out
and imjiortant suggestions ai'e made for further inquiry. In this connec-
tion it must be mentioned that the committee are much indebted to the

courteous and enlightened liberality of Major J. W. Powell, Director of
the U.S. Bui'eau of Ethnology, who has permitted Dr. Boas to incorpo-

rate with the measurements obtained in British Columbia those made by
him in Washington and Oregon under Major Powell's directions. It has
thus been possible for Dr. Boas to give to his treatment of this subject a
comprehensive character, which could not otherwise have been obtained,
by enlarging the scope of his discussion so as to include the more or less
intimately related tribes of the Pacific States with those of the Province
of British Columbia itself.

    --The following alphabet has been used in the report :

    The vowels have their continental sounds, namely: a, &s in father

e, like a in mate ;        i,  as in machine                                                                          o, as in note ;  u, as in rule.
                                                                                                                   ;

    In addition the following are used : d, o, as in German ; d^=aw in

law; E=e in floiver (Lepsius's e).

    Among the consonants the following additional letters have been

used : g', a very guttural g, similar to gr ; h', a very guttural k, similar

to  Jcr            q, the  German c/t in bach;                                                                        H, the  German   ch  in  ich;    a, between
                ;

q and H; c=sh in shore; r, as th in thin; tl, an explosive I; dl, a palatal

/, pronounced with the back of the tongue (dorso-apical).

                               THE BILQULA.

    The Bilqula, who are generally called Bella Coola, are the most north-

ern tribe belonging to the Salish family. They are separated from the

tribes speaking allied languages by the Chilcotin (of the Tinneh stock) in

--the interior, and on the coast by the Kwakiutl. Their language is considered
--grammatically more closely related to the dialects of the Coast Salish than

Ato those of the tribes of the interior.                                                                              number of terms referring to the

sea and sea-animals are the same in Bilqula and in the dialects of the Gulf

of Georgia ; so that we may safely assume that the two groups of tribes

were at one time closely related, and that the Bilqula were differentiated from

this group. They inhabit the coasts of Bentinck Arm and Dean Inlet, as

shown on the map accompanying the sixth report of the committee, and

extend far up Bella Coola River. Since the end of last century they

villages. The following is a list of their ancient villages, most of which

are still inhabited at certain seasons, although not regularly :

          1. Satsq.

       2. Nutl'E'l. The tribe of this place is called SotslumH.
       3. ISTuqa'lkH, embracing the villages K-omko'tEs and Stske'etl on the

Ta'lio, Nu'ik', A'seQ.

    17. K'oa'tlna, at the bay of that name in the southern entrance of

Bentinck Arm. On the north entrance of Bentinck Arm were the

Kilte'itl, but it is doubtful whether they belonged to the Bilqula or to
the He'iltsuk. The latter call the people of Dean Inlet Ki'mkuitq.

    Each of these tribes is subdivided into gentes, which appear to be
arranged in exogamic groups. I learnt the names of the following
gentes, which bear the names of their ancestors :

     The evidence wliicli I can present regarding the laws of intermarriage

is the following : I inquired of Nusk'Elu'sta (=cold water in face), a
member of the Talo'stimot gens, whether he might marry a Spatsa'tlt

woman ; this suggestion he rejected with the greatest indignation.

--Fig. 1. House-front of the gens Tok-oa'is.

Members of the first two gentes, he explained later on, are not allowed
to intermarry, neither are members of the last two gentes, while the first
and second may marry among the third and fourth. He accounted for

          y -I i

this by stating that lalo'stimot's son married Spatsa'tlt's daughter, and
that consequently the two gentes were related to each other.

     The gentes have crests similar to those of the neighbouring coast
ON THE NOETH-WESTEHN TRIBES OF CANADA.  411

tribes. The crest is represented in paintings on tbe honse- front and on

dancing implements.
     The gens Tok'oa'is has a killer-whale (DeJphinus orca) painted on the

house-front (fig. 1). The tradition says that the ancestor of this gens

one day, when hunting in the mountains, found a house on which a killer
was painted. The chief who lived in the house invited him and pre-
sented him with his crest for himself and for his descendants. The
crest consists of the killer- whale, eagle, swan, and heron.

    The crests of all gentes were obtained in like manner.
412 REPORT 1891.

     The gens Spatsa'tlt have breakers painted on the bouse-front, and use
in dances the mask of a large kind of whale (k-'Eiits), of the crow, and of

the black bear.

     The gens TumQoa'akyas use the mask of OnEstsito'ma (=the sleeper)

aud the eagle.
     The gens Tl'ak-aumo'ot of the Nusk-'c'lstEmH use the moon (fig. 2).
     The o-ens lalo'stimot of the Talio'mH use the raven, robin (aiii'a'qone),

eao-le, whale, the bii-d t'entlala (genus ?), and s'atlsd'ots, the flood-tide.
They have sun, moon, and stars painted on the house-front, and the
nusqi^'mta suspended from the beams of the roof (see p. 420).

     Tbe hio-hest gens of Nutl'E'l has the name Smo'En (=the north wind).

He has the mountain Suwa'kHH surmounted by a mackerel sky, and with

clouds on its sides, painted on his house-front (fig. 3). Another object
belonging to his crest represents waves.

     The children belong to the gens of either father or mother, the deci-

sion being left to the choice of the parents.

Secret Societies and the Potlatch.

The social organisation, festivals, and secret societies of the Bilqula

are still more closely interrelated than they are among the Kwakiutl, and
Wemust be considered in connection.
                                        have to describe here the potlatch,

the Sisau'kH, and the Ku'siut. The Sisau'kH corresponds to the Tloola'qa

of the northern Kwakiutl tribes, the Kii'su'it to the Ts'etsa'ek'a. The

Bilqula believe that the potlatch has been instituted by ten deities, nine

brothers and one sister, the foremost among whom is Qe'mtsioa, to whose

care the sunrise is intrusted. He resides with the others in a beautiful

Fig. 4.-- Mask representing Qe'mtsioa.  --Fig. !^. Mask representuis

house in the far east, and cries 6 ! o ! every morning when the sun rises.
He has to take care that the sun rises properly. The first six of these deities
ON THE NORTH-WESTERN TRIBES OF CANADA.                                  413

are grouped in pairs, and are believed to paint their faces with designs
representing moon, stars, and rainbow. In the Ku'siut these deities
make their appearance, and are represented by masks which I have copied.
Qe'mtsioa and Qemqemala'otla wear the design of the full moon, indi-
cated in the mask Qe'mtsioa (6g. 4) by a double curved line in red and
black, the black outside, passing over forehead, cheeks, and upper lip.
Qemqemala'otla has a double curved line in red and black, the red out-
side, which passes over forehead, cheeks, and chin (fig. 5). Aiumkl'likya
(fig. 6) and Ainmala'otla (6g. 7) wear the design of the crescent, drawn

in red and black, with difiTerences similar to tliose between the first and

second. The fifth, K-'orak-'omki'likya, and K''o'mtsioa have designs repre-
senting stars (fig. 8), both wearing the same style of mask. The seventh
is K'ula'qawa, whose face represents the blossom of a salmonberry bush

(fig. 9). The next in order, Kule'lias (=who wants to have blankets

first), wears the design of the rainbow in black and blue (fig. 10). The
ninth, At'ama'k weai's on the head a mask representing a kingfisher, a.nd
is clothed in a birdskin blanket. The last of the series is a woman called
Tl'etsa'apletlana (=the eater), the sister of all the others. Her face is

painted with a bladder filled with grease (fig. 11). She figures in several

legends as stealing provisions and pursued by the people whom she has

robbed.

     The Sisau'kH, which is danced at potlatches and other festivals of

Agentes, is presided over by a being that lives in the sun. man who had

gone out hunting met the Sisan'kn, and was instructed by him in the

secrets of the dance. When he returned he asked the people to clean

their houses, and to strew them with clean sand, before he consented to
enter. Then he danced the Sisau'kn, and told the people what he had

seen. He said that the being had commanded them to perform this dance

and to adorn themselves when dancing with carved headdresses with
414  EEPOET 1891.

trails of ermine skius, and to swing carved rattles. The man, later on,
returned to the sun. Ever since that time the Bilqula dance the Sisau'kn.
Besides this it is stated that the Raven gave each gens its secrets.

     --Fig. 8. Mask representinc         --Fig. 9. Mask representing

          K"'omk-'omki'IikTa.                           K'ula'qawa.

     Each gens has its peculiar carvings, vphich are used in the Sisau'kH
only, and are otherwise kept a deep secret, i.e.,thej are the sacred posses-

sions of each gens. All gentes, however, wear the beautiful carved
headdresses and use the raven rattles, regardless of the carving they
            ON THE NORTH-WESTERN TRIBES OF CANADA.  415

represent. Every time the sacred objects of a ^ens are aliowa to the

people a potlatch is given. The sacred objects, although the property of the

various gentes, must nevertheless be acquired by each individual. That

is to say, everj'' free person has the right to acquire a certain group of

carvings and names, according to the gens to which he or she belongs.

Slaves and slaves' children, also illegitimate children, could not become

ASisau'kH.  person cannot take a new carving, but mnst wait until it is

--given to him by his relatives- father, mother, or elder brother. Nusk'E-

lu'sta, to whom I owe my information regarding the gentes, and who is

a member of the gens lalo'stimot of the Talio'mH, stated that he had

received the raven when he gave his first potlatch. At his second potlatch
he received the eagle. He hopes that his mother will give him the whale

at his next potlatch, and will at the same time divulge to him the secrets

connected with it. In course of time, he said, he might get even others

from his brother ; but if the latter's children should prove to be very

good, and develop very rapidly, his bi'other would probably give his secrets

to his children. At festivals, when a person acquires a new secret, he

'ihanges his name. Each person has two names, a Ku'siiit name, which

remains the same throughout life ; and a Qe'mtsioa name, which is changed

at these festivals. Thus, Nusk'Elu'sta's (which is his Ku'siiit name)

present Qe'mtsioa name is Atl'itlEmnE'lus'aiH, but at his next potlatch he

intends to take the name of Kalia'kis. These names are also the property

of the various gentes, each gens having its own names. In the list of

gentes given above, the names enumerated are the Ku'siiit names of the

ancestors. In two cases only the Qe'mtsioa names have been ascertained

(see p. 409). When a man possesses several Sisau'kn secrets he will dis-
tribute them among his children. When a girl marries, her father or

mother may, after a child has been bora to her, give one or several of

their Sisau'kn secrets to her husband, as his children make him a member
of the gens. When a person gets to be old he gives away all his Sisau'kn

secrets. After any secret has been given away the giver must not use it

any more. The crest and the Sisau'kn carvings must not be loaned to

others, but each person must keep his own carvings. The only exceptions

are the carved headdresses and the raven rattles, which are not the

property of any particular gens.

The laws regarding the potlatch are similar to those of the Kwakintl.

The receiver of a present becomes the debtor of the person who gave

the potlatch. If the latter should die the debts become due to his

heirs. If the debtor shoald die his heirs become responsible for the

debt. Property is also destroyed at potlatches. This is not returned,

and serves only to enhance the social position of the individual who

performed this act. It is not necessary that all the property given

by a person in a potlatch should be owned by him. He may borrow

part of it from his friends, and has to repay it with interest. I was

told, for instance, that a man borrowed a large copper-plate and
burnt it at a potlatch. When doing so he had to name the price which

he was going to pay to the owner in its stead. Since that feast he died,
and his heirs are now responsible for the amount named at the potlatch.

     The Ku'siiit is presided over by a female spirit, called Anaulikutsai'H.
Her abode is a cave in the woods, which she keeps shut from February

till October, remaining all the while inside. In October she opens the

Adoor of her cave and sits in front of it.  woman is said to have been

the first to find her. Anaiilikiitsai'H invited her into her cave and taught
416 EEPORT-- 1891.

Ler the secrets of the Ku'siut. She wore ornaments of red cedar-bark

around her   head,  wrists, and  ankles                                        her  face  was  blackened, her  hair
                                                                            ;

strewn with eagle-down. She commanded the woman to dance in the

same way as she saw her dancing. The people should accompany her

dance with songs, and, after she had finished, they should dance with

masks. She said, ' Whenever a person sees me your people shall dance

the Ku'siut. If you do not do so I shall punish you with death and

sickness. In summer, while I am in my house, you mnst not dance the

Kii'siiit.'

    Ever since that time the Bilqula dance the Kii'siiit. When a man has

seen Auaiilikiitsai'H sitting before her cave he will invite the people to a

AKii'siiit.  ring made of red and white cedar-bark is hung up in his

house, and the uninitiated are not allowed to enter it. Only in the

evening, when dances ai'e performed, they may look on, standing close to

the door. As soon as the dances are over they must retire from the

taboo house. Each Ku'siut lasts three days.

The various dances performed by members of the Ku'siut are also the

property of the gentes, and the right of performing them is restricted

to members of the gens. They must not be given to a daughter's husband,

as is the case with the Sisau'kii dances (see above), but belong to the
members of the gens alone. They maj', however, be loaned and borrowed

by members of the gens, who have a light to a particular dance, but who
do not own it. Permission to use a mask or dance is obtained from the
owner by payments. The owner may reclaim the dance or the borrower
may return it at any time. Membership of the Ku'siiit is obtained through
an initiation. At this time the novice is given his Kii'siiit name, which
he retains throughout life. Each gens has its peculiar Ku'siut names,
which are inherited by young persons from their parents or from other
relatives. Thus a young man who had the name of Po'po until he was
about seventeen years old obtained at his initiation the name of Tl'ako'otl.

I have not reached a very clear understanding of the details of the initia-
tion ; it seems that the dance is simply given to the novice in the same

way as the Sisau'kn, this initiation being connected with a potlatch. But
still it seems possible that he must ' dream ' of the dance which he is to
perform. Only the highest degrees of the Kii'siiit have to pass through a
religious ceremony of some importance. The hjghest degrees are the

Elaqo'tla (the Ha'mats'a of the Kwakiutl), the O'lEq (the Nii'tlmatl of

the Kwakiutl), and the Da'tia (the No'ntsistatl of the He'iltsuk). These

Agrades are also hereditary.     Kii'siiit novice may acquire them at

once at his first initiation.

    When the Elaqo'tla is initiated he goes into the forest, where he

encounters his guardian spirit. It is believed that he goes up to the sun,

and formerly he had to take human flesh along for food. The chiefs held

a council the night preceding the beginning of the ceremonies, and any-
one who wanted to show his liberality offered one of his slaves to be
killed, in order to serve as food for the Elaqo'tla. The ofi'er was accepted
and a payment of from ten to twenty blankets made for the slave. The
latter was killed, and the members of the Elaqo'tla order devoured one-
half of the body before the departure of the novice to the woods. There

the latter is tied up and left to fast. He may stay there for twenty or
thirty days until the spirit appears to him and takes him up to the sun,

where he is initiated. Early one morning he returns, and is heard outside

the houses. He has lost all his hair, which, it is believed, has been torn
       ON THE NOKTH-WESTERN TRIBES OF CANAEA.            417

out by the strong breeze blowing in the higher regions. He is qnite

naked, and bites everyone -whom he can lay hold of. If he cannot catch
anyone he will bite his own arm. It is believed that he has lost his sonl,
which fled from the body when the spirit came to him. Therefore the
shamans must try for four days to recapture his soul. The night after
they have recovered it the Elaqo'tla dances clothed in a bear-skin and
wearing a large headring, heavy bracelets and anklets, all made of red
and white cedar-bark. Some Elaqo'tla do not bite people, but merely
devour raw salmon, or tear dogs to pieces and devour them. Those who
bite people will also eat corpses. The Elaqo'tla has to observe a number
of regulations. For four years after his initiation he must not gamble.
He must stay away from his wife for one year, but this period is being
reduced to one month. For two or three months he must not leave his

house.

   The O'lEq (= the laugher) and the Da'tia (= the thrower) do not go

into the woods to be initiated, but both must fast three days before their
first dance. The O'lEq ' makes fun of everything ' and scratches people
with his nails. The Da'tia carries stones and sticks, and breaks household
goods and canoes. If he has destroyed some object during the day he
pays for it at night when he dances. The OlEq and the Da'tia must stay
for one month, after they have danced, in their houses.

    If a person transgresses the laws of the Kii'siut, for instance when the
Elaqo'tla gambles, or when a man performs a dance to which he has no
right, also when a person derides the ceremonies or makes a mistake in
dancing, his punishment is death. The chiefs assemble in council and the
offender is called before the court. After his offence has been proved he

is asked whether he is willing to suff'er the penalty of death. If he is not
willing, and one of his relatives is found willing to take the penalty on
himself, the guilty party is spared, and the substitute is killed in his stead.

The execution of the judgment is entrusted to the shaman, who bewitches
the condemned person by throwing disease into him, or by poisoning him
in some other (supernatural ?) way. The object thrown by the shaman
is a shell, bone, or finger-nail, around the middle of which objects a human

hair is tied. If this object strikes the off'ender he will fall sick. Blood
collects in his stomach, and if it so happens that he vomits this blood, and
with it the disease-producing object, he will recover, and is not molested
any further. The masks (not the whistles and other ornaments) used in
the Ku'siut are bui'nt immediately at the close of each dancing season.
Novices must wear a necklet of red cedar-bark over their blankets for a
whole year. The masks used in the dances represent mythical personages,

and the dances are pantomimic representations of myths. Among others

the thunder-bird and his servant Atlqula'tEnum, who wears a mask with,
red and blue stripes over the whole face from the right-hand upper side
to the left-hand lower side, and a staff" with red and blue spiral lines,
appear in the dances. Prominent masks are also Qe'mtsioa and his
brothers and his sister (see p. 412), Masmasala'niq and his fellows, the
raven and the Nusqe'mta, and many others.

Customs eegaeding Bietft, PnBERTy, Marriage, and Death.

When the time of delivery approaches, the woman leaves the house

and resorts to a small hut built for the purpose. She is assisted by pro-

fessional midwives. The cliild is washed in warm, water. For ten days
the mother must remain in this hut. Father and mother must not go
near the room for a year (according to Nusk'Elu'sta, for ten days), else

 the salmon would take offence.

     The child is soon given its first name. On this occasion the whole
tribe is invited to a feast, the name is made public, and the guests receive
small presents. The child retains this name until it becomes a member
of the Ku'siut, when it is given its Kii'siut name. This ceremony takes
place after puberty has been reached. About this period the young man

gives his first potlatch and assumes the Qe'mtsioa name.

     When a girl reaches puberty she must stay in the shed which serves

as her bedroom, where she has a separate fireplace. She is not allowed
to descend to the main part of the house, and must not sit by the fire of

the family. For four days she must remain motionless in a sitting pos-
ture. She fasts during the daytime, but is allowed a little food and

drink at a very early hour in the morning. After this term she may

leave her room, but only through a separate opening. She must not yet

come to the main room. When leaving the house she wears a large hat,

 which protects her face against the rays of the sun. It is believed that

if the sun should shine on her face her eyes would suffer. She may
 pick berries on the hills, but must not come near the river or sea for
a whole year. She must not eat fresh salmon, else she would lose
her senses, or her mouth would be transformed into a long beak. She
must not chew gum or eat snow (see Fifth Report of Committee,

 1889, p. 838).

     If a young man wishes to marry a girl he goes, surrounded by his

friends, to the house of the girl's father and states his intention. His
friends carry food and presents, and if the father accepts the suit he
sends out a young man, who receives tlie food and presents and carries
 them into the house. Sometimes the father does not accept the offer at

once. In such cases the young man may repeat the same ceremony until

 he is finally rejected or accepted. After the time of the man-iage has
been agreed upon between the contracting parties, and the day preceding

the marriage has arrived, the young man invites all the people to a feast,

during which he states that he is to be married on the following day.

He asks a number of men, generally from twenty to thirty, and four
women to assist him. On the following forenoon they assemble, and
accompany the bridegroom to the girl's house. They sing outside, and
four of the men dance. All of them have their faces painted red. Finally
they enter, and the bridegroom gives a large amount of property to the
girl's father. Then the girl leaves her parents and goes to the bride-
groom, bringing him also a largo amount of property which has been
given to her for this purpose by her parents and relatives. He in turn

gives her blankets and other apparel of the best quality, and distributes
presents among her relatives. This is repeated after some time. All he
has given to his bride and her relatives is repaid to him with interest.

A rich girl will repay twice or three times the amount given by the man.

At the time of the marriage the bride's father may promise the groom to
give him his Sisau'kn secrets as soon as the pair have their first child.
The children may belong to the father's or mother's gens, as the parents
may choose.

     In case of a separation the wife refunds the amount of purchase-

money. The children may stay with either parent, or part of them may
ON THE NORTH-WESTERN TRIBES OF CANADA.  419

go with the mother and part with the father. The decision is left to the
 parents and children.

    When a person has died the corpse is washed, the face painted red,

 the legs are doubled up, and the arms folded over the breast. The nose-
omament of the deceased is put into his nose ; his shirt is put on, the
 back part covering the breast and the front part turned backward. The
 body is placed in a box and the latter is either fastened on the lower

 branches of a tree or placed in a little house, which is set on posts, above
 the level of the ground. The face of the deceased is turned eastward.

 Part of his property and gifts from his friends are deposited near the
 grave. The masks of the deceased are burnt. His crest is carved on a

memorial column, which also shows how many canoes, coppers, head-
dresses, and slaves he had given away at potlatches. These objects are

 painted or carved on the columns, Foi^merly slaves were killed at the
burial of chiefs. The number of slaves killed was also indicated by so

many human figures on the memorial column. After burial food for the

use o£ the deceased is thrown into the fire. This is repeated frequently

during a prolonged period after the death has occurred. "Whenever the

friends of the deceased partake of a meal a little food is thrown down at
a place between the fire and the door, where the entrance to the lower
world, the home of the dead, is believed to be.

     The bed of a mourner must be protected againt the ghost of the de-
ceased. His male relatives stick a thorn-bush into the ground at each

corner of their beds. After four days these are thrown 'into the water.
Mourners must rise early and go into the woods, where they stick four

thorn-bushes into the ground, at the corners of a square, in which they
cleanse themselves by rubbing their bodies with cedar-branches. They
also swim in ponds. After swimming they cleave four small trees and
creep through the clefts, following the course of the sun. This they do

on four subsequent mornings, cleaving new trees every day. Mourners
cut their hair short. The hair that has been cut off is burnt. If they

should not observe these regulations it is believed that they would dream

of the deceased. Women when mourning scratch their cheeks with,

shells or stones.

    The mourning regulations for a widower or a widow are especially
strict. For four days he (or she) must fast, and must not speak a
word, else the dead wife or husband would lay a hand on the mouth of
the offender, who would then die. They must not go near water, and
are forbidden to catch or eat salmon for a whole year. For the same
length of time they must not eat fresh herring or olachen. Widow and
widower cleanse themselves in the same way as other mourners. Their
shadows are considered unlucky, and must not fall on any person.

     Some time after the death of a rich or influential person his nearest

relative invites the whole tribe to a potlatch. On this occasion he sings
a mourning song for the deceased and gives away presents to his guests.
It was explained to me that this ended the mourning, and that it was
' the same as giving away the bones of the deceased.'

                                    Eeligion and Shamanism.

     The mythology of the Bilqula differs greatly from the mythologies of
the other tribes of the North Pacific coast. It is impossible to say to

                                                                                                                                EE2
--420 KEPOBT 1891.

wtat cause this divergence is due. Mythology and religion are so closely
connected that a few words on the former must be added here. The

principal deity of the Bilqula is Snq, the sun-god (compare sonq, sun).

The rays of the sun are his eyelashes. When prayed to he is called

Taat'au. In praying the Bilqula look heavenward. I obtained the fol-

lowing formulas : Atll:HH itlutlsuq, Taat'au, ' Look on us where we are
going, Taat'au ; ' and Taat'au, atlkHaltiiomdu tlq, ' Take care of us, Taat'au.'
Snq is pre-eminently the ruler of the world, and does not interfere with
the actions and thoughts of men. These are given by Masmasala'niq.

According to the tradition of the Bilqula, before the liberation of the
sun, and before the world was made as it is nowadays, four deities liTed
on the earth : Masmasala'niq, Yula'timot, Matlape'eqoek, and Itl'itlu'lak.
The raven wished to obtain the sun, but he was unable to liberate it.
Then he went to these deities and asked their help. They ascended to
the sky, and tore the curtain, which up to that time had been expanded
between heaven and earth, hiding the heavenly orbs. The sun appeared,
but he shone dimly, as though darkened by clouds. The raven ascended
to heaven through the rift made by Masmasala'niq, and found there a
beautiful prairie country in which all the birds lived. Masmasala'niq and
his brothers painted them beautifully and sent them down to earth,
giving each his song and his arts. The raven was not content with the

sun, and resolved to try and find a better one. He flew to the house of
a great chief, who kept the nusqe'mta (nw-<a=place of, sqem=ih.e

day is dawning). The nusqe'mta was a small round receptacle closed all
around like an egg. The chief guarded it jealously, and kept it sus-
pended from one of the rafters of his house. The raven knew that he

could not obtain it by sheer force, and resorted to a ruse. He assumed

the shape of the leaf of a spruce tree, and let himself drop into the pond
from wliich the chief's daughter used to take water. Tlie girl drank
from the pond, swallowed the leaf, and thus became with child. She
gave birth to a boy, who was the raven himself. The old chief loved the
boy dearly, and allowed him to play with the niosqe'vita. This was what

he desired. He ran out of the house, broke it, and flew away in the

shape of a raven.
      After the sun had thus been obtained Masmasala'niq said : ' Let us

make man.' He made the image of a man out of wood, but he was

unable to endow it with breath. Matlape'eqoek and Itl'itlu'lak tried
likewise to carve human figures and to give them life, but they failed.
Finally, Yula'timot carved the figure of a man and endowed it with life.

He made a man and a woman in each country, and they became the

ancestors of all the numerous tribes. Then Masmasala'niq gave them

their arts. He taught them to build canoes, to catch salmon, to build
houses. He made rivers everywhere, that man should have water to

drink, and that the fish might go up the rivers to be caught by man.
      The Bilqula believe that Masmasala'niq and his brothers still continue'

to give new ideas to man. They say that any new design of painting op
carving, or any other new invention made by a member of their tribe,

has been given to him by Masmasala'niq.
     The religious side of the potlatch and of the secret societies has been

referred to above.

     The soul is believed to dwell in the nape. It is similar in shape to a*
bird inclosed in an egg. If the shell of the egg breaks and the soul flies
away its owner must die. Shamans are able to see and to recover souls.
       ON THE NORTH-WESTERN TRIBES OF CANADA.                421

By laying their Lands on tbe nape of a person they are able to tell

whether his soul is present or whether it has left the body. If the soul

should become weak they are able to restore it to its former vigour. If

a person swoons it is believed that his soul has flown away without

breaking its shell. The shaman hears its buzzing wings, which give a

sound like those of a mosquito. He may catch and replace it in the nape

of its owner. If the soul leaves the body without breaking its shell the

owner becomes crazy.

The art of shamanism is bestowed by Snq. It is impossible to obtain

it by means of fasting and praying, as is the case among the neigbbouring

Atribes, but it is a free gift from the deity.  person who is to become a

shaman will fall sick, and, during his illness, Snq will give him a song

which must be kept a deep secret. After this he is able to cure diseases.

If a person falsely pretends to have received the gift of shamanism, and

tries to suck out diseases from a patient, he will fall sick himself.

   When asked more closely about the curious difference between this
mymethod of obtaining the power and that of the neighbouring tribes
informant said : ' When an Awiky'e'noq wishes to become a shaman he may

go to the mountain where the deity of their shamans resides (probably

Ma'tem) who will initiate him. No Bilqula can obtain the art in such a

way.'

    Sickness is caused by a disease entering the body or by witchcraft

A(see p. 417). The shaman is able to extract the disease by sucking.

peculiar method of witchcraft, somewhat similar to the ' ek"'a ' of the

Kwakiutl (see Sixth Report of the Committee, p. 612), was described to
me as follows : The person who wants to bewitch his enemy endeavours

to obtain some of his old clothing, portions soaked by perspiration being

considered especially effective. After it is obtained a wolf is killed, and
the clothing is put into its mouth, which is then tied up. Then the wolf
is placed in a box. This procedure is called simk. Sometimes the

clothing or some hair is inclosed in the bone of a wolf or of a dead person.
No shaman can counteract these charms.

    If a person has been murdered, and a string is tied firmly around the
neck of the corpse, the murderer's neck will become diseased and he will

be unable to breathe and will die. If sand is strewn in the corpse's eyes

and the lids closed over it the murderer will die. If a person has been
killed with a knife or arrow, or another weapon, to which some of his

blood adheres, the latter is brought into contact with a wolf's head, dog's
hair, or anything else that is bad, and then thrown into the fire or put
into a frog's or snake's month ; then the murderer will die.

     I add here a few current beliefs :

Sneezing indicates that people are talking about one.

Slight ringing of the ears indicates rain, loud ringing good weather.

     Twitching of the muscles of the left side of the body is unlucky ; of
the right side lucky. Twitching of the skin under the eyes indicates

that one will cry.

If a dog dreams and howls in its sleep its owner will die.
The breaking of a box without an apparent cause is unlucky.

                                                 Wars.

watchman was appointed in each canoe, who sat in the bow. On landing

near the village of their enemies they divided themselves into a number

of parties, one house of the village being assigned to each. Then, early

in the moi'ning, when all were asleep, they rushed up to the village utter-

ing their war cry ' wai ! ' They took a stand at the fire which burns

in the centre of the house, and if any one of the enemies succeeded in

taking up his arms and came out of his bedroom they killed him. Then

they entered the bedrooms, killed the men, and took the women and children

along as slaves. The heads of the dead were cut off, the houses burnt,,

and they returned home singing wai'-songs. The heads which they had

taken along were then scalped, and the scalps tied to each end of a pole.

When they approached their village one man stood up in the bow of each

canoe and swang the pole to which the scalps were attached, and they all

sang songs, in which their deeds were recounted. The scalps were

valued the higher the longer and fuller the hair. They were used in the

Sisau'kH.

The following tales of war expeditions offer some points of interest.

About thirty or forty years ago there was a famine at Bella Coola. The

people went overland to Knight Inlet, which belongs to the Tenaqtaq, a

tribe of the Kwakiutl, to fish there. The Tenaqtaq made fun of them,

took from them the fish they caught, tore the blankets from the backs of

the women, and seduced many of them. Finally the Bilqula returned!

home. There they held a council and resolved to make war upon the

Tenaqtaq. The Tinneh joined them in this expedition. They crossed the

mountains in four days. When they approached Knight Inlet they sent

two spies in advance, who were to count the number of houses in the

village of the Tenaqtaq. Early in the morning they attacked the houses

and killed a great many men. The Tenaqtaq could not escape, as they
were hemmed in by the river. The Bilqula slew them with knives,

lances, and stone axes. They took away the clothes of the women,,

leaving them naked, and subjected them to shameful insults in revenge

for the disgrace put upon their wives and daughters. Then they burnt

the village.

About thirty-five years ago the Talio'mH were attacked by the

Kwakiutl. Originally they intended to attack Nuqa'lkH, but the raven,,

according to the narrator, changed their mind, as he always protects the

 village of Nuqa'lkn.  They came in many canoes, while most of the

.

Talio'mH were at the lake, which is situated above that town, fishing.

Four men were in charge of the village, and a number of old men and
women had also remained at home. The father of Nusk'Elu'sta, who told
me of these events, happened to be out picking berries, accompanied by
his wife. He saw the canoes passing by and kept himself hidden. The

village of Talio was at that time surrounded by a strong stockade, which

consisted of a double row of palisades crowned with thorns. At each

corner there was a strong box fastened on the stockade like a tower.

Here watchmen were stationed, who were able to shoot at the enemy

while being themselves protected. At that time the Talio'mH had only

four guns. The Kwakiutl sent out two spies, who reported that the

village was well fortified. The Talio'mH had seen the canoes coming and

were on their guard. The Kwakiutl thought that they would not be

able to enter the village until after the stockade had been destroyed.
ON THE NORTH-WESTERN TRIBES OF CANADA.                             423

They resolved to make an attempt to burn it and to break open the door.

On the following day they came up to the village, but the guard on the

towers used their guns to such good effect that the enemy had to retreat

with severe losses. They made still another attempt, but with no better

success. They had lost many men, while only two old men of the Talio'mH,
TumHa'akyas and A'lk-ius by name, and one woman had been hurt. The

latter had been killed. When the Kwakiutl turned back a messenger

was at once sent up to the lake to call the young men, who then went to

Nuqa'lkH to ask for help. The Kwakiutl passed close to Nusk'Elu'sta's

father's canoe, but they were so terrified by the losses they had sustained

that they passed by without so much as noticing it. Two of their number

were so ashamed of their defeat that they would rather remain in the

enemy's country than return with their friends, and they stayed ashore.

Meanwhile the Talio'mH and the Bilqnla were pursuing the fugitives.

They had reached the outlet of Bentinck Arm without overtaking them.

Then their chiefs resolved to return, as they believed that their enemies

bad a long start upon them. Later on they learnt that the Kwakiutl

were at that moment only a few miles from them, about to continue their

homeward journey, after having encamped at the outlet of the channel.

Afterwards the Talio'mH found the two men who had remained ashore.

They called them and promised to send them back to their friends, saying

that the war had ended, and that they had no grudge against them. The

men were, however, too much afraid, and finally starved to death.

Later on the Talio'mH and Bilqula organised an expedition against the

AKwakiutl to take revenge for the unprovoked attack.  chief named

Koani'la, whose father was a Talio'mH, while his mother was a Kwakiutl,

was their leader. They intended to attack the Le'kwiltok" and the

Kwe'k'sot'enoq. When they approached the village of the latter they

sent a canoe ahead to search for the village, and to report the number of

houses. For two days they were unable to find the village, which lies in

a labyrinth of islands ; but finally they found it, and saw that it consisted of

sixteen houses. On the next morning they attacked it. Tlie tribe was

wholly taken by surprise and almost all of them were killed. Koani'la's

mother lived at this place, and when she heard the Bilqula coming she

asked at once for her son, and was taken care of by him. Only five men

and four women escaped. The Bilqula allowed these to run away, as

they had killed as many as they desired. Anukni'tsem, a chief of the
SEnqtlE'mh, was the only man of the Bilqula who was wounded. He

died on the way home. They returned, but in the country of the

Na'koartok" they were overtaken by four Kwakiutl canoes which pursued

them. The Bilqula were victorious, but Koani'la induced them to desist.

During the fight two of the women, whom they had taken as slaves, and

one boy jumped overboard, and were rescued by the Kwakiutl.

the calves of their legs from slipping down.' During their monthly-

periods women place soft cedar- bark in the vagina. The bark is afterwards
burnt in the woods. The smoke of this fire is believed to be poisonous.

      It is evident that the culture of the Bilqula is very greatly iniluenced

by that of the Kwakiutl. The secret societies and the potlatch ceremonies
are almost a copy of those of the Heiltsuk'. This influence has been so
deep that names of even deities and of the mythical ancestors of certain
gentes are pui'ely Kwakiutl words, or have at least Kwakiutl endings. Thus
the name Aiumki'likya (see p. 413) is purely Kwakiutl, meaning ' good all
over the world.' K"'6mk''omkiiikya is also a Kwakiutl word, meaning
' the rich one of the world.' The chief's name, Ma'lakyilatl (see p. 409)

belongs to the same class of Kwakiutl names. On the other hand, the

religious ideas of the Bilqula are very curiously developed, and apparently
but slightly influenced by their neighbours. The whole Masmasala'niq

tradition is peculiar to them, but has been partly adopted by the Awiky'-

e'noq, with whom the Bilqula have intermarried.

 PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TRIBES OF THE
                      NORTH PACIFIC COAST.

     The following tables embrace a considerable amount of material which
I collected on a journey in Oregon and Washington, undertaken for the
U.S. Bureau of Ethnology, together with material which I collected in

British Columbia. Thanks to the liberality of Major J. W. Powell,
Director of the Bureau of Ethnology, I am enabled to present here
the results of all the measurements which I made on the North Pacific

coast.

     The tribes of this region proved to be so heterogeneous that it was
necessary to subdivide the material into eleven groups, each embracing a
number of closely allied tribes. I have distinguished the following
groups :

     1. Tribes of British Columbia, north of Dean Inlet.
     2. Kwakiutl and Nootka.

       3. Bilqula.

     4. Lower Eraser River.
     6. Harrison Lake and Lillooet.
      6. Tribes of Washington, including the whole coast of that State west
of the Cascade Range.
      7. Columbians, including the tribes in the immediate neighbourhood
of Columbia River and in the Lower Willamette Valley.
     8. Northern Oregon, including the Yakonan and Salish tribes between
Umpqua and Columbia Rivers.
     9. Oregonian Tinneh and Coosan.
     10. Crosses between Oregonian Tinneh and Northern Californians.
     11. Northern Californians.

     Only a short series of measurements of each individual was made, such
as could be taken by the removal of only a small portion of the clothing.
Following is a list of the measurements.

                                      14. Height of nose.
8. Height, sitting.                   15. Width of base of nose.
9. Length of head.
                                      16. Maximum width of nose.

In measuring the ' stature,' the subject was asked to stand erect, but care

was taken to avoid excessive stretching, as in these cases the stature during

the process of measuring would undergo material changes. The ' finger-

reach ' is the greatest distance between the tips of the second fingers, the

arms being extended horizontally. In this case the subject was encouraged

to make the strongest possible effort. The measurements of stature, height

of acromion, height of point of second finger, were taken in rapid suc-

cession, in order to avoid changes of position as much as possible. In

measuring the point of the second finger the arms and hands were

stretched out downward, so that hand and arm formed as nearly as pos-

Asible a straight line.  glance at the tables will show that the results of

the measurements of ' height of ear ' (being the difference between the
stature and the height of ear above the ground) as obtained by this

method are very unsatisfactory. In most cases it was difficult to obtain a

sufficiently level surface for a satisfactory comparison of the two measure-
ments. Only among the Bilqula and the last three groups this difficulty

did not present itself. But even in these cases I do not consider the

results very accurate, mainly on account of the unavoidable movements

of the subject. I should prefer, at another time, to measure the distance
directly by Topinard's method. The difference between the heights of the

acromion and of the point of the second finger gives the length of arm

with greater accuracy, because I was able to take these two measure-

ments without moving the scale. The length and width of the head are

maximum  measurements ;  the  former  is  always taken from the glabella
                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

the vertical measurements of the face were taken from the naso-frontal

suture.

The indices require little explanation. The cephalic index is the

proportion between length and width of the head, the latter being
expressed in per cents, of the former. The index of ti.o height of ear is

the proportion between the length of head and the difference in height
of the ear and vertex. The facial index is the proportion of the naso-mental

line to the width of face, the index of the upper part of the face the pro-

portion of the naso-oral line to the width of face. I have given two

nasal indices, the proportions of the basal width and maximum width of

the nose, the former being measured at the insertion of the alas, to the
height of nose. The last three columns contain finger- reach, height sitting,
and length of arm, expressed in per cents, of the stature.

    Before discussing the measurements I give the tables. The descrip-
tions are withheld for the present, as it is desirable to gain some new

data.

In order to discuss the material contained in the preceding tables, I

have arranged it in series. The series for ' Stature,' ' Cephalic Index,'

' Facial Index,' ' Index of Upper Part of Face,' ' Finger-reach,' ' Height,

sitting,' and ' Length of Arm,' are given here. In selecting the cases to

be included in each series, it was necessary to exercise some criticism.

The ages of all individuals are estimated more or less incorrectly. In

order to fix the lower limit, I assumed nineteen years for males and seven-

teen years for females as the limit. For the facial index I assumed the

limits as twenty and eighteen. Only in such cases where the measure-

ments of a male of about eighteen years exceeded the corresponding

m.ost frequent measurements of adults, I included the case in the series,

as the probability is, that such an individual had reached approximately

its maximum growth. By this method the total results cannot be

depressed. It is more difficalt to decide on an upper limit. It appears

clearly from the tables that the changes incident to old age begin very

early among these Indians. The stature decreases, and the facial index

diminishes on account of the wearing down of the teeth. But there are

great individual differences regarding the time of the beginning of these

Achanges.  decrease of stature will always tend to increase the relative

length of arm, because the absolute length of the latter does not decrease

proportionately. In the same way the proportional part of the ' height,

sitting ' decreases as the trunk loses more rapidly, through the increasing

curvature of the spine, than the legs do. I have, therefore, excluded all

such individuals over forty-eight years (estimated), in whom these

indices differ from the most frequently occurring indices in such a sense

that they might be explained as caused by loss in size.

   A comparison of children's cephalic indices and of those of adults

does not seem to bring oat any typical differences between the two ; for

this reason, which is entirely in accord with Welcker's investigations of

the growth of the skull (' Untersuchungen iiber Wachsthum und Bau

des menschlichen Schadels,' Leipzig, 1862), I have not separated children

and adults. Neither do I find an appreciable difference between the

indices of males and females, and consider it therefore justifiable to lump

all the observations on this point. If, in Table 9, the measurements of

Oregonian Tinneh, north of Rogue River, are tabulated separately [for

what reason this separation is made, will appear later], the following

result is obtained, which shows how nearly the maxima of frequency of

occurrence of values of the cephalic index coincide among boys, girls,

adult males and adult females :

of observations great variations become more probable, and smaller ones
consequently less probable. Or the same fact may be expressed in this

--way : the limits of variation are probably the wider, the greater the

series of observations. Therefore the curve computed from a long series
is by no means the same, not even theoretically, as that computed from

a shorter series.

various tribes. In looking over the figures given for the Bilqula, it

appears that in the three cases considered here, two maxima of frequency
occur, while cases between the two maxima are quite rare. Furthermore,
it will be seen that the secondary maximum of this series coincides very
nearly with the maximum of the first group, embracing the northern
tribes and those of Vancouver Island. The cephalic indices do not

coincide quite so well as the other measurements, but still sufficiently

nearly. The primary maximum of the Bilqula agrees very closely with

that of the Oregonian Tinneh. It appears that the stature of the latter
varies more than that of the Bilqula, but I shall show later on the cause

of this curious fact. The resemblance of the two maxima of frequency
to the types of the Coast Indians and of the Tinneh is very far-reaching.
As this comparison is entirely based on the occurrence of the two maxima
among the Bilqula, it is desirable to show their actual existence more
evidently. For this purpose I have divided the whole series of the

Bilqula into two parts according to the order of the observations.

dual, as we might express it, is a mechanical mixture of the features of
the parent types. He may have the face of a Tinneh, and the stature or

head of a Coast Indian, and vice versa. This important fact also tallies
exactly with Ammon's conclusions on the blonde and brunette population

of Baden, and confirms the views which KoUmann expressed in 1883.
(' Arcbiv fiii- Anthropologie,' xiii. 79, 179 ; xiv. 1.) The fact that these

conclusions have been arrived at independently on entirely independent

material seems to give them great strength.

    When we turn to a consideration of the Oregonian Tinneh, we shall

find the same phenomena, although apparently somewhat obscured.
Instead of two distinct maxima, we find here a great number of cases
distributed equally over a long interval. The next northern group
differs but little from the Tinneh, but their southern neighbours show

quite a marked contrast, particularly regarding their cephalic index. If
we assume the Oregonian Tinneh to be a mixture of the two, and keep
the fact in mind that no middle forms originate, the form of the curve
explains itself easily. In looking at the crosses between the two groups,
their distribution according to the maxima of the two component groups
is brought out most strikingly, notwithstanding the small number of

cases.

In order to ascertain in how far these assumptions are justified, we

will subdivide the material in a different way. If the Oregonian Tinneh

contain a Californian element, we may assume that it is more prevalent

in the south than in the north. For this reason we will arrange the

material in the following groups : South of Rogue River, North of Rogue

WeRiver, and crosses between the two.  will compare preliminarily the

measurements from Northern Oregon with those of the group north of

Rogue River.

it is of secondary importance. In all these regions Tinneh are the main
mass of the population. Thej were present in Washington, and form a

considerable element among the Bilqnla. Therefore it must be assumed

Wethat this type represents the Tinneh of the Pacific Coast.  do not

know much on the physical characteristics of the Tinneh east of the

mountains. Bat according to Petitot they are tall (' Dictionnaire de la

langue Dene-Dindje,' p. xxi). Quatrefages and Hamy ('Crania Ethnica,'

p. 470) mention seven skulls of Tinneh, and find them to be brachy-
cephalic. Both these facts tally with what we found on the Pacific

Coast. I had occasion to question a number of former officers of the

Hudson Bay Company regarding the general appearance of the Tinneh

of the interior of British Columbia, and of the Mackenzie Basin. Accord-

ing to their descriptions, they resemble the tribes of the North- West

Coast much more closely than the Algonquin. The complete absence of

--dolichocephali at least according to the pi'esent state of our knowledge
--distinguishes the l^inneh most clearly from the eastern groups of

Americans, the Algonquin and Iroquois, as well as the eastern and

central Eskimo, so that I am inclined to class them as one of the Pacific

peoples. This view is supported by linguistic and ethnological evidence,

which, however, it is not the place to discuss here (see ' Journal of

American Folk-Lore, vol. iv. p. 13, S".). It is worth mentioning that the
Tlingit of Alaska, who have intercourse with the Tinneh, appear also

to be taller and more brachiocephalic.

The tribes of the northern parts of the coast of British Columbia

appear to be of shorter stature, ranging from 159 to 162 cm., and have

much more elongated heads. They are mesocephalic, the index ranging

Wefrom 11 to 81.  find the same type present, although to a lesser

degree, in Washington and on Fraser River, as well as among the

Bilqula. It appears to be absent in Oregon, but, remai'kably enough,

reappears as we approach California. Still farther south true dolicho-

cephali appear. I cannot discover any difference of type between the

northern tribes and those of Vancouver Island. This conclusion, drawn

from measurements of living subjects, is confirmed by measurements

of skulls from this region.

     I published in the 'Verb, der Berliner Ges. f. Ethn.,' 1890, p. 30,
measurements of a series cf ten undeformed crania from Vancouver

Island. All of them were obtained from a burial ground near Victoria,

and belong, therefore, probably to the LkuiigEn tribe. I reproduce the

cephalic and facial indices here for comparison. Besides these, No. III. of

the Songish crania, described on p. 813 of the Fifth Report of the Com-
mittee, may be made use of. To these may be added a skull described by

Flower (' Catalogue of the Specimens illustrating the Osteology,' &c., in

the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, p. 148), which belongs to
the West Coast of Vancouver Island, and another from the head of

Alberni Channel, from the Museum of the Geological Survey of Canada.

Furthermore, I add a series of measurements of slightly deformed crania

from various parts of Vancouver Island from my own collection ; the

Tsimshian skulls, described on p. 812 of the Fifth Report; three Tsim-
shian skulls described by Barnard Davis, and another, described by the
same author as a ' round head,' from Vancouver Island (' Thesaurus

Craniorum,' p. 229). Finally, I add a Haida cranium, which I measured

in the Piovincial Museum of Victoria. The numbers given here are

those of the catalojjrues of the various collections.

remarkable. The prevailing type is exceedingly brachycephalic and

charareprosopic, and their small stature is also quite unique. Their differ-

ence from all the other tribes appears so clearly from our tables that

farther remarks seem unnecessary, I have not found any analogy amono*

the neighbouring tribes, except at the mouth of Fraser River, whei-e the

same type might be expected to occur on account of the intermarriao'e of

these groups. The question regarding the relationship of this tribe must

remain at present an open one.

Among the other tribes the Columbians appear remarkable on account

of their tallness. It seems that their heads are a little longer than those

of the neighbouring tribes, but the data do not bring out the difference

with sufficient clearness. There appears to be no reason to suppose that

more favourable conditions prevailed in this region, and should have pro-

duced the development of greater stature.

   We will finally consider the proportions of the bodies of the various

groups. It appears that the finger-reach of the southern groups, especi-

ally of those of southern and central Oregon, is much smaller than that
of the northern tribes. amI inclined to attribute this fact to a difference

of occupation, the first-named two groups living on reservations, while

the others are fishermen. Together with this lengthening of the fino-er-

reach seems to go an increase in the length of the arm. These variations,

may be seen in females as well as in males. The women pass also much

of their time in the canoe, which explains the corresponding variation in

their sex. The table also shows that the trunk of these Indians is much

longer than that of Europeans and also longer than that of the Iroquois,

which, according to Gould, is 53'4 per cent. It seems that the trunk of

the southern group is a little longer than that of the northern ones.

WeI will finally sum up the results of this investigation.        find an

almost homogeneous population on the coast of British Columbia, with the

exception of the region of Dean Inlet. It is characterised by a stature

ranging between 159 and 162 cm. ; a cephalic index ranging between 17

and 81, a facial index ranging between 78 and 81. At Bentinck Arm

and in Washington this type is mixed with another, which also prevails ia

Oregon, so far as it is inhabited by Tinneh. This type is characterised

by a stature ranging between 166 and 172 cm. ; a cephalic index ranging-

between 84 and 87, and a facial index of from 83 to 86. In Northern

Oregon this type is found quite pure. Farther to the south the type is-
mixed with that of the northern Califomians, which becomes the more

prevalent the farther south we go. In Washington the same type seems

to exist, but subordinate to it the northern type is found. It is the

Weprimary element among the Bilqula.  consider this type to be peculiar

to the Tinneh. The type of northern California is characterised by a

stature ranging from 160 to 164 cm. ; a cephalic index of from 79 to 81,

and a facial index of from 83 to 86. On the whole this type resembles the

Afirst so much that I am inclined to identify them.  third and a quite

unique type is found at Harrison Lake. The individuals are short, with

very wide faces and heads. There is no similar tribe known to exist in

this region, and their affinities appear doubtful. On Columbia River we

find a fourth type, remarkable for its tallness, with a cephalic index of

from 80 to 84. I believe that these may be identified with the tall tribes

of the interior, but farther evidence is required on this point.

Fifth Report of the Committee, consisting of Sir John Lubbock,

    Dr. John Evans, Professor W. Boyd Dawkins, Dr. K. Munro,
    Mr. W. Pengelly, Dr. Henry Hicks, Professor Meldola, Dr.
    MuiEHEAD, and Mr. James W. Davis, appointed for the pur-
    pose of ascertaining and recording the localities in the British

     Islands in tvhich evidences of the existence of Prehistoric

    Inhabitants of the country are found. (Draiun up by Mr. James-
    W. Davis.)

Tour Committee, in presenting their fifth report, have pleasure in draw-
ing attention to the list of lake dwellings found in the British Islands
compiled by one of their number.

The Sites of Lahe-Bxuellings or Crannogs hnown up to tliis Date in Great
                                          Britairi and Ireland.

     The following alphabetically-arranged lists have been compiled
mainly from Munro's ' Lake Dwellings of Europe,' to which work we
refer our readers for an epitome of the scientific results obtained from
practical investigation, as well as further references to the voluminous
literature on the subject. As many of the sites and remains of these
ancient habitations have been destroyed in the course of drainage and
other agricultural operations, and are now known to have existed merely
from tradition or incidental allusions to them in the early annals of the
country, we distinguish by an asterisk (*) those that have been carefully
observed or more or less practically investigated, and when the recorded'
observations are of special archaeological value we give the reference to
the original source of their publication. To include more than this, as^.
for example, the merest abstract of researches, would so greatly add to
the length of this report that its tabular character would be entirely

destroyed.

      Several reports on prehistoric objects have been promised by scientific
observers in various parts of the country, and your Committee urge that
no more delay should be made in presenting them than is compatible
with accuracy and thoroughness. It is requested that the Committee be

reappointed as before without grant.

Fourth and Final Report of the Coomnittee, consisting of the Hon,
     Kalph Abercromby, Dr. A. Buchan, Mr. J. Y. Buchanan, Mr. J.
     Willis Bund, Professor Chrystal, Mr. D. Cunningham, Pro-
     fessor Fitzgerald, Dr. H. E. Mill (Secretary), Dr. John
     Murray {Chairman), Mr. Isaac Egberts, Dr. H. C. Sorby,
     and the Eev. C. J. Steward, appointed to arrange an
      investigation of the Seasonal Variations of Temperature in
     Lakes, Rivers, and Estuaries in various parts of the United
     Kingdom, in co-operation ivith the local societies represented on
     the Association. (Draiun up by Dr. H. E. Mill.)

                                                     [Plate XV.]

At the meeting of 1890 this Committee requested reappointment with a
grant of 501. in order to draw up a final report on the work inaugurated
at its suggestion and carried on by observers, most of whom acted under

the auspices of local scientific societies represented on the Association.
It was proposed to include in the final report a quantity of material of
great value bearing on the seasonal and diurnal variation of river- and
sea-temperature accumulated by the Scottish Meteorological Society and
still unpublished, and, in addition, to give a general discussion (sup-
ported by recent publications of observations in the ' Reports of the
Fishery Board for Scotland ' and other journals) of the whole question
of the variation of temperature in exposed bodies of water as determined
          ON THE SEASONAL VARIATIONS OF TEMPERATURE.                                       455

by season, actual meteorological conditions, tidal influence, &c. Tlie

grant of 201. "vvhicli was given to the Committee on its reappointment

was quite inadequate to pay the working expenses of the scheme and

admit of employing a competent person to tabulate and compute means

of the great mass of available material.

It was accordingly resolved to confine the scope of this report to an

account of the observations made on the direct initiative of the Committee,

and to the statement of such brief summaries as might be supplied in

tabular form by previous observers. The main object held in view by

members of this Committee from its first appointment, viz. to produce an

authoritative and exhaustive memoir on the seasonal variations of tem-

perature in the lakes, rivers, and estuaries of the British Islands had to

be abandoned. At the close of its four years of existence the Committee

can only claim to add some additional data to the store awaiting future

discussion. This addition is of considerable scientific value, and casts

light on several problems in the regime of lakes and rivers. The obser-

vations have, however, led directly to another and perhaps even more

beneficial result. Great interest was taken by the Conference of Dele-

gates from local societies in the establishment of observations in their

own neighbourhood. The consciousness that they were engaged in col-

lecting data for a special and definite purpose has stimulated many of

the observers to a more earnest study of science, and done something to

forward that spirit of fellowship amongst all scientific workers which for

the last few years the Association has been so successfully advancing by

means of the annual conferences. The results of this stimulus may, it is

hoped, continue even when the observations which produced it have

ceased.

The three previous reports of the Committee may be referred to for

particulars as to the method of working, the instruments employed, and

the period over  which  the    observations  extended                                      a comparatively small
                                                                                        ;

number were continued into the year 1891. The first report' was

mainly preliminary. The observations it records were upon rivers in

Scotland, and although several of the observers have continued their

work, most contented themselves with the record of a few months
only. The second report ^ notes a large accession of observers on the

rivers of England and of Ireland, and as an appendix the directions to

observers are reprinted, showing the conditions in which it was desirable

that all the observations should be made. In 1889 the reappointment of

the Committee was not accompanied by a grant of money, and the

observations in that year consequently sufiered to a certain extent. The

third report ' gives an epitome of the material collected by the Committee,

which forms the basis of the present discussion. The three previous

reports, it will be noticed, deal exclusively with the organisation and

extent of the observations, none of the data being recorded or discussed

in them.

Some of the sets of observations have been published in detail. Of

these the most important is that accumulated by Dr. Sorby during the

years 1884-1888 on the estuaries of the south-east of England, which

appeared in the ' Scottish Geographical Magazine ' for 1889 (vol. v.

AnP- 589).  abstract of the results is included in the present report.

The observations of Mr. W. Watts on behalf of the Manchester Geo-

logical Society at the Piethorn and Deushaw Reservoirs have been

printed in full in the ' Transactions ' of that Society. Mr. Ashvs^orth's

observations on the Cowm and Spring Mill Reservoirs have also been

published in a summarised form with detailed curves in the ' Proceed-

ings ' of the Rochdale Literary and Scientific Society.

     In addition to the observations specially made or discussed for the
Committee, many papers are to be found in the ' Proceedings ' of the

Royal Society of Edinburgh, the publications of the Meteorological

Societies, in the annual reports of the Fishery Board for Scotland from

A1887 onward, and in the ' Scottish Geographical Magazine.'  full

discussion by Dr. H. R. Mill of very detailed temperature observations

made hy the staff of the Scottish Marine Station on the Clyde Sea area

is nearly completed, and will be presented to the Royal Society of

Edinburgh.

The best method of publishing the results of the observations dealt

with in this report has been carefully considered. There are peculiar

difficulties in dealing with a mass of data compiled by observers, some of

-- --whom are skilled and others uninstructed in their work, especially when
   as in this case the observations are taken with regularity in few cases

and often at different hours. The record of actual observations will be

preserved by the secretary of the Committee, who will be glad at any

time to place it at the disposal of any one interested in this branch of

meteorology. Weekly means have been calculated for each of the

stations where reasonably regular observations were made, and these are

published in the form of curves in this report. The curve-form was

chosen in preference to printing the figures, on account of the much

more vivid impression conveyed by inspection as to the relative air- and

water-temperatures and their seasonal variations. The unit of the curve

is the weekly mean, as in many cases on one or more days of the week

the observations were omitted, and a curve of actual daily readings

would present a very broken appearance, besides thi'owing into undue

prominence purely temporary variations. The monthly means are given

in tabular form. The monthly means are usually calculated as the average

of the four or five weekly periods comprised in the month but in the

case of very regular observations the monthly mean is given as the

average of the daily readings. Compai'ison of the two methods shows

practically identical results in the case of regular observations, and where

the observations are irregular the method adopted for general use
obviously gives more satisfactory results. On account of the much

greater difficulty of measuring the temperature of air, less reliance must

be placed on that pai't of the work than on the temperature of the water,

which is easily found in a readily comparable manner.

For the drawing of most of these curves and the calculation of the

means from them the Committee has to acknowledge the assistance of

Mr. John Gunu, F.R.S.G.S.

In several instances, when the observations were carried on by skilled

meteorologists in conjunction with the routine of a meteorological

station, the observers accompanied their records with a short summary

and discussion, in which the most striking relations of temperature were

pointed out. These statements, either completely or in abstract, are

embodied in this report.

              A. Observations not recorded in full in this Report.

     These observations were, as a rule, made by skilled observers for
Bpecial purposes, and the abstracts were prepared specially for this report

by the investigators, to whom the thanks of the Committee are very

cordially given.

                                River Cherwell at Oxford.

     Observations of the temperature of the Cherwell have been made
regularly every morning since 1878 by Mr. Edward Chapman, M.A.,
P.L.S., of Magdalen College, Oxford. The ordinary meteorological
observations having been made at the same time, make it possible to
compare river-temperature, air-temperature, and rainfall. The river-
temperature recorded below is the mean of daily observations at 9 a.m.,
the air-temperature is the mean of the maximum and minimum thermo-
meter in the shade for the previous twenty-four Hours, and the rainfall
is the amount in inches which fell in the previous twenty-four hours.

     The length of this series of observations gives it peculiar value in
affording an indication of average conditions. The average air-tempera-
ture for the ten years was 48°'9, the average water-temperature at 9 A.M.
60°-3, or 1°'4 warmer than the air; the mean annual rainfall for these
years being 24-79 inches. The average monthly means are shown in the
Curve below. The year of lowest air-temperature was 1887, with 47°"6,

water- temperature was nearly a degree below the average (49°' 5). The

difference between the average temperature of the warmest and coldest

year recorded was only 2°'5 for the water.

    The highest mean temperature of the water for any month was 68°'

in July 1887, the month of highest air-temperature also, with an abnor-

mally low rainfall, but in a year the temperature of which was below the

average. The lowest mean temperature of the water was 32°'4 for

January 1891 (air 32°'6), but the lowest air-temperature was 29°'2 for

December 1890 when the water had a mean of 33°'3.

    The difference in average temperature of water for the same month in

different years was greatest in the months of annual maxima and minima.

The hottest June was 10°"6 warmer than the coolest June the warmest
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

January was 9°'7 warmer than the coldest January. At the time of

annual average temperature the difference was least ; thus the warmest

April was only 5°'6 and the warmest September only 4°'2 above the

temperature of the coldest month of the same name.

    On the average, as shown in Curve XXX., the air-temperature came

nearest the water-temperature in the winter months, notably in November

and January, when they almost coincided (difference 0°'2), and the two

temperatures diverged most in the summer months, particularly April,

May, and July, when the difference averaged 2°'3. During the ten years

of observation the average monthly air-temperature was higher than the

average monthly water-temperature at 9 a.m. on 17 occasions. Of these

6 occurred in January, 2 in February, 4 in November, and 2 in December,

or  14  in  the winter months                                                                                   1  Avas  in  March,  1  in  May, and  1  in  October.

In no April, June, July, August, or September, between 1882 and 1891,

has there been an instance of air being warmer than water on the average

of a whole month. Of course, in the remarkably fine observations now

recorded the comparison is made between average air-temperature for the

whole 24 hours, and average water-temperature at 9 a.m. only, while in

the short series of observations specially made for the Committee the air-

and water-temperature are both calculated for 9 a.m.

estuaries at low tide was usually from 1^ to 4 fathoms, that of the open
water about 6 fathoms. The observations extend over the period from
May to September in each year, as long a time as it is practicable to live
on a yacht in such an exposed situation.

     Making allowance for the incomplete data, tbe mean temperatures in

Date
--464 KEPORT 1891.

     la July 1886 the North Sea was 2°-3 cooler than the Wallet, and
5°'6 cooler than the estuaries. The water of the shallow estuaries evi-
dently heats up more rapidly in spring, attains a higher temperature ia
summer, and cools down more rapidly in autumn, than does the open

sea. The observed maximum temperatures were as follows :

       McDakin, under the auspices of the Dover Natural Histonj Society.

     The place of observation is about 1,000 feet fi-om the shore. Depth
of water about 32 feet at lowest tide.

     In the previous year temperatures were taken (at irregular intervals,
and therefore not in conformity with the requirements of the Committee)
to ascertain the difference of temperature of the surface water of the
tides running north and south, their relation to fogs, &c.

     The temperature does not appear to be affected by the northerly or

southerly set of the tide.

     The average water- temperatures during the abnormally cold winter of
1890-91 were for December .33° -0, January 36°-5, February 40°-0, or 7°-S
below the average of the same three months of the previous winter, when
the temperature might be considered normal. The low temperature
appears to have been caused by the melting snow on the surface water.

I am inclined to think, from numerous careful observations made by

myself, that 40° is the lowest normal winter temperature.
     The lowest temperatures were on December 16, air 27°, water 28°,

and January 10, air 26°, water 28°. It was stated in the local press that
at Margate ' the ice was drifted and packed at the foot of the cliffs to
the height of six feet. The shore for a great distance was covered with
crabs and starfish which had been frozen to death.'

     The small river Doui', rising from two springs at Alkham and Ewell,
and flowing into the sea at Dover, about four miles distant, remained
unfrozen during this severe winter. The temperature on one occasion
was 48° when the surrounding country was covered with snow and ice.

vations on tlie water of the sea at certain fixed stations is given. The
summarised results in tabular form are given below, in order to render
them more available to other workers, and to afford ready compari-
son with other records carried on simultaneously in different places.
The following tables are expressed in Centigrade degrees, most of the
instruments used by the Board's observers being graduated on that

system.

     Ardrishaig and Brodick are situated on the Clyde Sea Area, and
observations of surface-water only are taken twice daily at the end of the
steamboat piers in water never less than G feet deep at low water.

     The Bell Rock Lighthouse stands in the North Sea nearly opposite
the estuary of the Tay and twelve miles south-east of Arbroath, being
thus quite beyond land influence.

from the North Sea prevents sun-heat from raising the surface tempera-

ture more than 0°1 C. in the warm months, and allows no rise of tem-

perature at all in the cold months. It is probable that the effect is pro-
duced by the warming power of the ebb-water at 'J a.m. making up for
loss by radiation at night, and this would completely account for the
range being greater at the bottom than on the sui'face, as the surface is
naturally more affected by the fresher ebb-water.

--470 REPORT 1891.

     The Abertay Liglit- vessel is anchored in about 8 fathoms of water,
the depth varying from 6 to 10 fathoms according to the tide, at the
mouth of the Firth of Tay. Its position differs from that of any of the
other stations, most nearly resembling Oxcar, but subject to much more
intense and variable conditions. The tides run very strongly, and the
shifting of the sandbanks on both sides of the entrance to the Firth must
produce corresponding changes in the direction of the tidal streams.

     The tidal effects at Abertay are remarkably distinct and striking.
They are brought out in the following table, which extends and confirms
the conclusions drawn from the Oxcar and North Carr observations.

              Abertay LigM-vessel.
ON THE SEASONAL VAEIATIONS OF TEMPEKATURE.  471

about tliree-quartei'S of a degree C. colder in the afternoon tLan in the

--morning the average of the month of June shows this afternoon cooling

to be as much as 1°'8 C. In the cold months the phenomena are reversed.
When the tide is high in the morning and low in the afternoon, the water
is about half a degree C. colder in the afternoon than in the morning

in December as much as l°-0 C. When the tide is low in the morning

--and high in the afternoon, the water is about three-quarters of a degree C.

warmer in the afternoon in December as much as 1°"6 C.

     It thus appears that the tidal effect on temperature is stronger than

the solar. In summer, no matter how hot the day may be, the water at

the Abertay lightship cools steadily until the hour of high tide ; in winter,

no matter how cold the night may have been, the water warms steadily
until the hour of high tide. The explanation is simple and sufficient.
The temperature of the water of the Tay is always higher in summer and

lower in winter than that of the sea, and putting the case generally, the

Abertay light- vessel floats in Tay water at low tide, in North Sea water

at high tide.

     These observations, which are not further alluded to in this report,
serve to record a very large amount of thoroughly trustworthy observa-
tions. Especial attention is directed to Mr. Chapman's magnificent series
of mean monthly temperatures, which illustrate very clearly the varia-
tions in the seasonal swing of temperature in water in one of the most
extreme average climates of the British Islands, taking its low altitude
into account. It serves not only to record the variations in temperatures
of the Cherwell, but to suggest the range of deviations from normal
seasonal temperatures to be expected in any case. Thus we are warned
not to assume the mean of one or two years as being the real mean
temperature of any exposed body of water.

                         B. Record of Occasional Observations.

   Many observations taken regularly at intervals of a week acquire some

value in tracing the seasonal variations if they have been carefully per-
formed and carried out at exactly the same hour on each occasion.

Observations ly Mr. F. C. Bayard, LL.M., F.E.Met.Soc, made under the
      auspices of the Groydon Microscopical and Natural History Clul.

    These observations were made once a week at a number of points near
the sources of the river Wandle, which takes its rise as an outflow from
the chalk, and throughout its course of ten miles to the Thames is never
known to freeze.

     The observations of temperature on the Wandle by Mr. Bayard once
a week for 1889 are published by Mr. Thomas Gushing, F.R.Met.Soc. in
Report of the Meteorological Sub-Committee of the Croydon Micro-
scopical and Natural History Club for 1891. Mr. Cushing gives the
following abstract of the extreme temperatures observed and the yearly-

range :

carried on at Cowm and Spring Mill Reservoirs, permission to do this
having been obtained from Mr. W. Tomlinson, the manager of the

Rochdale Corporation Waterworks.

     The observations began on January 1, 1890, and a synopsis of the

Aresults obtained is given below.  record of the rainfall and the number

of days on which rain fell has also been included. The hour for observ-

ing the instruments is nine o'clock in the morning, but at Cowm during

the month of Januaiy 1890 the readings were taken at twelve o'clock,

noon, and in consequence a considerable difference will be remarked
in the mean temperatare of the atmosphere at the two stations in that

month.

Both reservoirs lie in valleys running nearly north and south (open

to the south) about one and a half mile apart, and from three to four

miles north of Rochdale. Cowm, the larger reservoir of the two, is 816

feet above sea level, and its di-ainage area is 900 to 1,000 acres. Spring

Mill is 771 feet above sea level, and has a drainage area of 500 to 600

acres.

The accompanying table sufficiently explains itself. The figures at

both stations differ but little, but in column iv. it will be noticed that

the monthly range of ivater temperature has been generally greater at

Cowm than at Spring Mill ; the extreme oscillation during six months

covers 25°'5 at the former and 25°'2 at the latter station. The wide

difference in the fluctuations of air and water temperatures is brought

out more strikingly in the chart.

tions at Damfries were taken throughout the twelve months. Mr. Jas.
Lewis took the observations of the estuary at Kingholm Quay, from Jane
25 to March 21, and observations were begun at later dates in the River

Dee by Rev. W. I. Gordon, of Tongland, and in the Dee estuary by Mr.

Macdonald, ligh.thouse-keeper, Little Ross. These are not reported upon
in the present discussion. The Nith observations were taken at the
Dumfries boathouse, where there was an average depth of more than 3
feet. In consequence of the damming of the water by the weir below the

Old Bridge the river at this point never falls very low, the depth never

being less than 2^ feet. On two occasions of heavy flood the parapet

--wall was overflowed once in the beginning of November, when the

depth was estimated to have been fully 10 feet, towards midnight on the
1st; and again on January 25, after heavy rain and the melting of snow
on the high grounds, with a south-west gale, when the depth of 9 feet was
registered at the gauge on the Old Bridge. The hour of observation
was at or near noon. The following table shows the mean temperature
of the air and water for each month separately, along with the state of
the river or the mean depth as registered at the gauge (which was

erected in July), viz. :

those in which the day

was at the shortest and the

longest. In other words,

tliei'e were two maxima

and two minima of differ-

ence between the tempera-

tures of the air and water,

the former occurring in

the months of March and

September, the equinoctial

months                                             and  the latter in
                                                ;

December and June, the

months of the winter and

summer solstice.                                        The

former fact is easily ex-

plained, but it is rather

!i curious circumstance

that the same thing shoiild

hold good of the month in

which tlie sun is longest

above the horizon, and

most nearly vertical. The

explanation, I have no

doubt, is that in the latter

part of June and the first

part of July, when there

was a period of drougrlit

and warm weather, which

lasted more than three

weeks, the river fell to its

lowest level, and the cur-

rent was very sluggish.
Hence the water became

more heated than in ordi-
nary circumstances, and its

temperature more nearly approached that of the air.                                                                                JJ

     Though, as a rule, the temperature of the air was higher than that of
the water, there were a good many exceptions to this rule, especially in
the months of May, June, July, November, and December. Thus there

were five days in May in which the water was warmer than the air, six

in June, and four in July, with an aggregate excess in the temperature
of the water of 37°. In November and December there were also fifteen
days with an aggregate excess of 30° '4, the greatest number being in
December, viz., ten days, while on other two days of that month the tem-
perature of air and water was equal. The conditions under which this
state of things was observed were, as a rule, in summer, when the air
temperature was lowered by cloudy and wet, or dull and foggy weather,
or by the prevalence of cold winds ; and, in winter, when the conditions
were similar, or when frost set in. The most extreme difierence was

--observed on July 7, when the reading of the air temperature was 53°,

and that of the water 65° a difiFerence of 12°. This was at the close of
the period of drought before alluded to. The greatest excess in the
temperature of the air above that of the water occurred in March, when
on sixteen days it was higher by more than 7°, ranging from 7° to 14°"5 ;
and the next in September, in which month there were thirteen days in

which the difference exceeded 7°, ranging from 7° to 13°'2. On these

occasions the weather was for the most part bright and sunny, or, if

cloudy or rainy, very mild, with south or south-west winds.

     The following table shows the mean monthly temperatures of the air
and water of the estuary of the Nith at Kingholm Quay, where observa-
tions were taken with great i-egularity by Mr. James Lewis, for a period
of about nine months, from June 25, 1889, to March 21, 1890. The
hours of observation necessarily varied, because the proper temperature
of the estuary could be obtained only when the tide was up. For the
most part they were taken between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., though
 sometimes a little earlier and sometimes a little later.

somewhat modified if the observations had been extended over the whole

year instead of nine months, but not, I think, to any great extent, there

being an obvious reason why the temperature of the estuary should be

higher than that of the river as compared with that of the air, viz., the
fact that when the tide rises it passes over the extensive tracts of sand
which in the Solway Firth are left bare by the receding tide, and in
sunny days become heated by the sun.

    By the kindness of Mr. Beck and Mr. Lindsay, observations were
made from August 8 to 19, and from September 13 to October 1, on

Lochrutton loch, with the following results :

Dean's house. Remarks on ' State of River and Weather ' are entered
in the observing book at the same time. The following are some of the

results noticed.

     In December, as a general rule, the temperature of the vrater is higher
than that of the air, but there are exceptions, e.g., on December 19 the
temperature of air and water was nearly the same, viz., 43°, the wind at
the time was "W.S.W., and the weather clear and fine. It was the same
on December 24. The greatest difference in the temperature of air and

water was on the 25th, when that of the air was 35°, and of the water
44°*3. On January 1, 1889, the difference is more remarkable, viz., air
30°"6, water 40°, and the same was the case on the day following, viz., air
29°, water 38°'5, with the wind N.E. and weather fine.

   A sudden rise of temperature occurred on January 8, when that of the

air was 39°'8, and of the water 38°'2, somewhat colder than the air, the
wind S. and the weather fine. The same was the case the day following,
viz., air 45°, water 41°-5.

     As a rule the temperature of the water does not increase so rapidly as
that of the air. On ]\Iay 5, for instance, the air was 69° and the water
57°-2, the same on May 9, viz., air 62°, water 57°.

     In February, with snow on the ground, the temperature of the air
varied from 25° 8 to 34°-8, and that of the water from 34°-6 to 39°-5, the
wind at the time being E. to N.E.

     Speaking generally, it is observed that with the wind S. or S.W., and
rain falling, the temperature of air and water differs by only one or
two degrees.

Notes on Temperatures of Air and Water at Canterbury, from May 1889 to
               Lecember 1889. By Colonel W. H. Horslet, B.E.

    The previous set o'f notes refers to observations taken up to May 15,

1889. In the same month the temperature of the air rose considerably,

the highest being on the 29th, when it was G9°'8, while that of water was

only 60°, the wind being S.W. and weather fine. Towards the end of

May the temperature of air and water once more approximated.

On June 2 there was a sudden and considerable rise in the air-tem-

pei'ature, but only a moderate rise in that of the water, the difference

between them being 14°, with the wind as above ; this again showing

that the water-temperature rises slower than that of the air.

    On June 10, with a N.N.E. gale blowing, the temperatux-e of the air

fell to 53°, while that of the water was 55°'2. As a general rule through-

out this month the water-temperature was below that of the air. The

last-mentioned is in fact the only instance to the contrary.

On June 20 the thermometer in use was accidentally broken, and

considerable delay ensued in procuring a new one of similar construction.

An ordinary instrument was, in the interval, supplied to Mr. Dean, and

with it the observations were taken and recorded until September 19.

The readings of this instrument, and that supplied subsequently from

Edinburgh, were found to agree very fairly, and the results of the obser-

vations taken during the interval show, as might have been expected,

that the air-temperature is above that of water throughout the summer

months, June, July, and August. There was only one exception, viz., on

August 23, when the air was one degree colder than the water, with the

Awind in the N.W. and weather fine.  similar exception to the general

rule occurred on September 16, the air being 53° and the water 55°, with
ON THE SEASONAL VARIATIONS OF TEMPERATURE.  487

the wind also in the N.W. Again on September 17, with the wind S.E.
and weather fine, the air was one degree colder than the water.

     From September 20 to the end of December the new thermometer
was in use, and it is observable that from that date to October 7 the
temperature of air and water approximated very nearly, the water as a
rule being the colder of the two. From October 9, however, there are
several exceptions to this rule, notably on the 13th and 14th, when the
water-temperature was 4° higher than that of the air, the latter having
fallen suddenly some 6° in two days, and the water only 2° during the
same interval. The same was the case on October 25, with the wind
N.N.W. and the weather fine. In November and December the fluctua-
tions in the relative temperatures of air and water were frequent, but,
speaking generally, the water-temperature was higher than that of the

--air the greatest difference between them being on December 29, on which

date the air registered 26°-5, and the water 40°-3, a difi'erence of 13°"8.
This is the coldest day recorded, with the wind S.W. and weather fine.

     In conclusion it should be mentioned that the prevailing direction of
the wind in Canterbury and neighbourhood for the greater part of the

year is from the S. W., veering to W. and N.W. In the spring of the year

it is from the E., veering to E.N.E. and N.B. At such period the tem-

perature of the air is invariably colder than that of the water, the

atmosphere very dry, and plenty of dust flying about. At other seasons
of the year when the wind is from the S. and S.W. the reverse is the
case, i.e., the water is the colder of the two. The highest aii'-temperature

recorded in these observations was on June 7, viz., 74°, while the water-
temperature on the same date was 62°.

   Notes on the Temperature of Air and Water as taken at the River Stour,

        Canterbury, during 1890. By Colonel W. H. Horslet, B.E.

    In the report for 1889 it was stated that in the months of November
and December the fluctuations in the relative temperatures of air and
water were frequent, but speaking generally, the water-temperature was
higher than that of the air. The same remark applies to the observa-
tions taken in January 1890, though there are some remarkable excep-
tions, showing that the temperature of water is not influenced so quickly
as that of the air. For instance, the temperature of the air, which had
averaged 39° in the first five days of January, suddenly rose on the 6th
to 51°'3, while that of the water, which had been 44° on the 5th, only
rose 1°'6 on the 6th of the same month. The same was the case on

--January 12 air 51°, water 48°, with wind S.W. and W. And again,

on the 16th and 19th, air 50°-3, water 47°"5, on the last-mentioned date.
Another remarkable instance is reported on January 25, viz., air-tem-
perature 54°, and that of water 44°-5, difi'erence 9°-5, that of air having
risen suddenly from 37° on the 24th to 54° on the 25th, while that of
the water had only risen 2°"5 in the same interval. The weather
throughout January was unusually mild, the wind for the most part S.W.
with occasional rain.

     In February the temperature of the water was, with one exception,
higher than that of the air. The exception occurred on the 13th, the
temperature of the air rising suddenly from 31° to 45°, while that of the
water rose only 1°, viz., from 39° to 40°.

     In March there was a remarkably sudden fall in the temperature of
the air, viz., from 29° on the 3rd to 14° on the 4th. The frost on that

day was the severest that had been experienced in the memory of ' the
oldest inhabitant,' and told hard on water-pipes and shrubs. On the
same dates the temperature of the river Stour was 37° and 36°, a differ-
ence of 1° only, while that of the air was 15°. The severe frost, it will

be observed, did not last long, for on the following morning, the 6th, the
temperature of the air rose to 38°-3, and that of water was 38°, or only
2° higher than it was on the 4th. Further instances of the rapid rise in
the air-temperature as compared with that of the water are observable

in the observations taken on March 6, 7, and 8, and again on the 9th a

rapid fall in the air occurred, and little or none in the water-temperature.

Wind N.W. and weather fine.

     Observations were omitted in April, May, and June, as the observer
was not furnished with a book to enter them in.

     In the month of July the temperature of the air usually exceeded

that of the water, as it might be expected it would. The highest air-

temperature was 71° on the 17th, when the water was 62°, difference 9°.
The lowest air-temperature was 55° on the 11th, and that of water on
the same date 57°, difference 2°. Wind generally westerly, veering to
N.W. and S.W., with occasional showers but generally fine.

     The same rule, as respects the relative temperatures of air and water,

applies to the observations taken in August and September, the water
being invariably colder, though not more than 6° or 7° difference, and

often less, especially towards the end of each month.

In October a change is observable, the water being frequently the

warmer of the two, notably on the 22nd and 28th, when the difference

was 9° and 10° in favour of the water, with a cold easterly wind on the

former date, and N.W. on the latter.

A further instance of the sudden rise in the air-temperature, as com-

pared with that of the water, is seen by comparing the observations taken

Aon October 28 and 29.  warm S.W. wind caused the air- temperature

to rise 10°, while that of the water remained the same on both days.
     The same remarks are applicable to the month of November, the

water-temperature being usually the higher of the two. The exceptions
occurred on the 13th, 15th, and 2ord. On each of these dates there was
a sudden rise of air-temperature, and no corresponding rise in that of
water. The wind S.W." and weather dull and wet. The lowest air-
temperature in this mouth was on the 30th, viz., 22°-5, the water being

38°, difference 15°-5.

December 1890 was an unusually cold month, the thermometer

standing at or below freezing point for twenty out of thirty-one days.

It opened with a temperature of ] 7°-5 on the "first, on which date the

water was 37°, or 19°-5 warmer than the air. This state of things did

not last long, for on the 4th the temperature of the air was 4° 5 higher

than that of the water. As a rule, however, the water-temperature was

higher than that of the air throughout the month. The Stour being a

running stream, the surface was not frozen even with the air-temperature

at 18°. On the contrary, the water-temperature on these days, viz.,

13th and 14th, is recorded to have been 30° and 37°, that is, 18° and 19°

warmer than the air. The wind for the most part of the month was

Afrom the cold quarter, viz., E. and JST.E.  fall of snow occurred on the

19th with the wind at E.S.E., and again on the 27th. The weather

throughout the month was dull and cold.

contain some apparently new observations on the protective character of
a sheet of ice against the cooling of water by radiation. The rapid fall
of temperature following a thaw is analogous to the effect observed on
earth thermometers not far from the surface in like conditions.

    Notes on the Txiver Temperatures for the Winter 1890-91 in the Nicld.

                           By Mr. G. Paul, Knareslorough.

     Some very interesting effects were observed dui'ing the long period
of intense cold. The river was frozen over, but the water under the ice
remained at the constant temperature of 84<°'0 from December 20 to
January 2 inclusive. It fell to 33° on thawing on Januai'y 3. On
January 6 a second period of ice on the water commenced, and daring it
the temperature under the ice remained at 33°'0. Not until the next
thaw set in and a tliird frozen period commenced on February 27, did the
temperature of the water under the ice fall to 32°'0.

     Compared with this the record of earth-temperature at tlie depth of

1 foot acquires a special interest. An ice-cap was formed on the ground

on December 21 and remained until January 21. During this entire

month the temperature at the depth of 1 foot scai-cely varied. On

December 20, before the severe cold set in, the temperature at that depth
was 37°-4, on the 21st it fell to 36°-5, next day to 36°-4, and until
January 4 its range was only between 3G°'4 and 36°'3. From January
2 to 17 the temperature at 1 foot was 36°-3 or 36°-2 ; on the 18th it fell
to36°'0, and on that day the grass thermometer registered only 3°"8, the
minimum temperature of the winter. On January 20 the 1-foot earth
thermometer registered 36°'4, but on the 21st it fell to 35°'5, coincident
with a rise of air-temperature and a general thaw. Next day the tem-
perature at 1 foot had risen to o6°'2, and did not again fall below this

value.

     The rest of the observations are given in the form of tabulated
monthly means and of curves expressing the weekly means. Had time
and other circumstances permitted, many or all of these sets of observations
would have been fully discussed, but the mere record suggests many
interesting relations as to the period of maximum and minimum tem-
perature, the manner in which watei'- temperature follows air-temperature,
and the effect of situation in latitude and altitude on the rate and amount
of monthly change.

                                 Bristol Channel and TAFf.

     The Cardiff Naturalists' Society arranged for three sets of observa-
tions from February 1889 to July 1891. One was taken by Mr. Petti-
grew in the Cardiff Castle Gardens on the Dock Feeder, a large stream
diverted from the Taff. This set of observations (Curve XII.) shows
the water-temperature to be always higher than that of the air. This
is the only case in which this relation, so cleai'ly shown in the Cherwell
observations, was distinctly seen in another river.

     The Breaksea Lightship is anchored in the Bristol Channel about the
centre, south of Barry Island. Observations were made on it daily at
9 A.M. by Mr. J. Walters and Mr. J. R. Johnson. The record (Curve X.)
shows that while the temperature is rising, from February to July, the
water is colder than the air ; but when the temperature is falling, from

This relation holds good for almost all observations made on the sea or

Mr. J. Bartlett. They show (see Carve XI.) the same general features

as those at Breaksea, but the seasonal interchange of position in the air

and water curves is not quite so clearly marked. The tidal effects must

be important, judging from the result of calculations on observations

greater cold of the water was observable in nearly all the rivers on which
observations were taken, and on some was more marked than in the case
of the Severn. The river-temperature followed the air-temperature closely

at all seasons.

The temperature is taken about 8 feet from the bank, where the depth
of water varies from 4 feet to 12 feet or more.

     The Braan is a rapid mountain stream ; about half a mile above the
point at which observations are taken, it emerges from a deep narrow rocky
ravine well wooded and about one and a half mile long. Before its
junction with the Tay a mill- lead is cut from it to the Tay, and the
temperature is observed near the outlet of this artificial channel.

    Both sets of observations are shown in the same diagram. Curve XXVI.

The Braan is always a few degrees colder than the Tay and follows the
variations of air-temperature much more closely than does the larger
river. The Tay was almost always warmer than the air, and this was
particularly the case in the summer of 1889, when for more than a month
both rivers had a temperature over 60°, a temperature which the air did
not reach on any occasion as a weekly mean. It must, however, be
noticed that the early hour of observation would account for a low air-
temperature. The river-temperature runs much closer to the air-
temperature during the period of heating up than while cooling down.

than the air while the temperature was rising and at the seasonal maxi-
mum, but warmer than the air when the temperature was falling and at
the seasonal minimum. The range of sea- temperature was decidedly less
than that of air-temperature, and the curve for the water is more uniform
than that for the air, showing little tendency to follow sudden and tern-

porary changes.

ture of the water (Curve XXVIII.) was almost always higher thau that
of the air, and had a nearly equal range but was less subject to small

ON THE CAPTtJRE OF COMETS BY PLANETS.  511

On the Capture of Comets by Planets, especially their Capture by
                 Jupiter. By Professor H. A. Newton.

   [A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in externa
                                           among the Reports.]

1. Some years ago I obtained and published ' a formula expressing in
simple terms the total result of the action of a planet in increasing or
diminishing the velocity of a comet or small body that passes near the
planet. This formula is 2>ractically a modification of the integral of energy,

Athe smaller terms in the perturbing function being omitted. very brief

and partial treatment of it was presented to this Association in 1879 at
its Sheffield meeting.^ Within the last two or three years several astro-
nomers have made special study of the manner of Jupiter's action in
changing the orbits of comets that pass very near him. M. Tisserand
has given us an expression connecting the major axis, inclination, and
parameter of the orbit described before coming near to Jupiter with the
corresponding elements of the orbit after leaving the neighbourhood of
the planet.^ M. Schulhof has applied the formula of M. Tissei-and as a
criterion for determining the possible identity of various comets whose

orbits pass near to Jupiter's orbit.'' Messrs. Seeliger, Callandreau, and
others have continued these investigations. The interest thus shown in

the problem has led me to resume the study of the subject and to work
out the results of the formula obtained by me in 1878 more fully than

they have been hitherto developed.

    2. One of the remarkable distinctions between the comets of long (or

infinite) periods and those of short periods is that the orbits of the

latter have almost without exception direct motions and small inclinations

to the plane of the ecliptic, while the orbits of the former have all
possible inclinations between 0° and 180°. At first sight this seems to
imply that the two groups of comets are radically distinct in origin or
nature one from the other. The most natural line of investigation there-

fore is the effect of perturbations in bringing or not bringing the comets
to move with the planet after the perturbation.

    3. The algebraic processes by which was obtained the formula for the
change of energy which a small body experiences from passing near a
planet were given in the article cited, and they need not be here repro-
duced. The following was the resulting equation, viz. :

A=- --4>mfa'^v, cos <i sin a                                ,, .
                       ^ '-
                              . . · (1)

and it was obtained from the general differential equations of motion by

at which the comet is equally distant from the planet, the term 2mfa- jr^

Therefore

This equation is valid whatever be @, the major axis of the orbit C^, and

may be used to determine the major axis of either orbit from the elements

Myof the other.    present purpose is, however, to study the action of

Jupiter in changing orbits that are originally parabolas, and hence in

general @^ will be taken infinite. In that case                                                                            .... (-2)

    It will be found that the second member of (2) depends on to, d, and
h, and these are known quantities when the elements of C/ and g) are
given. The use of the equation is, moreover, greatly simplified and

enhanced by the fact that the plane of the planet's orbit is involved only

in so far as that it must contain the tangent to B at E.

     6. In the second member of (2) all the factors are positive except

@cos <^ ; hence if <j><ij7r,  is positive and the orbit (£ is an ellipse ; but if

@^>^7r, is negative and C is ^^ hyperbola. This result may be thus

expressed : If the comet passes in front of Jupiter the kinetic energy of the

comet is diminished ; if it passes liehind the planet the hinetic energy of the

comet is increased. The reason for this may also be given iu general

language. If the comet passes in front of the planet the comet's

attraction increases the velocity, and hence increases the kinetic enei'gy

of the planet, and vice versa. But the total energy of the two bodies is

constant, so that when that of the planet is increased that of the comet

is diminished, and vice versa.

   @7. It is desirable now to transform the value of given in equation

(2) so as to be able to determine the major axis of the new orbit of the

comet directly from the circumstances of its initial approach to the

@planet before                                                                                                             in terms of m, d,

-- A8. To find s. In fig. 1 let and E represent the two points A and E

AE AYas defined above (Art. 4), and the line
                                                                                                 represent d. Let    be the

EOtangent to at A, and                                  the tangent to gl at E. It is an admissible
                                                 (![,i

supposition that the planet is describing the straight line OE, and that

the comet in its unperturbed orbit is describing the straight line TA.

At some certain moment the line joining the planet and the unperturbed

OYcomet must evidently be perpendicular to OE. Let                                                              be the line

joining the bodies at that moment, so that the planet is at O when the

EOYcomet is at Y, and  is a riyht angle. Instead, however, of supposing

the planet to move from towards E we may apply an equal, opposite

     Fig. 1.      motion to the comet, and consider the planet to

                  remain at rest at O. Draw AC parallel to EO and
                  make AB equal to the distance described by the

                  planet during the time that the comet is moving

                  from Y to A. Join YB. Then since YA and BA

                  jepresent in direction and magnitude the motions of

                  YBthe two bodies in a given interval, the third side

                  of the triangle represents in magnitude and direc-

                  tion the motion of the comet relative to the planet.

                  YABThe angle                                 is the angle o>, and the three sides

                  BAof the triangle YA, YB, and                                                            are proportional

                  YBCto V, z'o, and v^. Let the angle                                                      be 6; then from

                  the triangle YAB we have

                       ^ -- +cos2
                                                        ,. 2   o:,i,';v                          <j> 7"',

Since V and v, can be computed from the given elements of the orbits of

the planet and comet, we may readily compute from w the value of s,
or Vajv,. But if the planet is at its mean distance from the sun, and the

=comet's orbit is "parabolic, v"^ 2y^^, and we have
                          = -62 3 2^/ 2 cos w . . . . (4)

  --9. To find p. The planet being regarded at rest at O and the relative

un|itrturbed motion of the comet being along YB, this line may within

admissible limits of error be treated as one asymptote of the relative

YBorbit C. The perpendicular from O upon                                                         will then be by definition

OX(Art. 4) the line p. Draw                                    from perpendicular to OY and OE,

ABand let these three lines be coordinate axes. Let the line                                                       meet the

XOY ODplane

EACD. Since   is perpendicular to AY, and also to EO, and so to its

parallel line AC, therefore it is perpendicular to the plane YAC. Hence

EAOC parallel to  is perpendicular to the plane, and so perpendicular

computation. We may, however, now treat d, h, ana w as independent

variables whose varying values may express all the diS'erent possible

cases of approach of the comet to the planet, so far as change of periodic

@time of the comet is concerned. The dependence of upon the three

variables cannot be very easily represented graphically in a single plane

diagram. But by giving to co successive values in multiples of 10°, viz.,

direction of Jupiter's quit.' The place of encounter with Jupiter will be
near an apse of the comet's resulting oi-bit about the sun, The comet

leaves the planet with the relative velocity v^, so that if s < 1 the motion
>about the sun in the new orbit will be direct ; if s 1 the motion ia the
new orbit will be retrograde. That is, by (4) when w < ^tt the resulting
>motion is direct ; when m ^ir the resulting motion is retrograde.

     In the second case the angle 2a, being greater than 180°, stands for

the angle between the asymptotes exterior to the orbit. Hence the
comet passing behind the planet will be turned forward and will leave
the planet in the direction of Jupiter's goal, and have a velocity that will

send it permanently out of the solar system.
     21. The results of Art. 20 assume that w is given. To find for what

value of u) the period of the resulting orbit is the shortest possible we

greatest effect of perturbation of a planet moving in a circular orhit in

shortening the periodic time of a comet originally moving in a parabola is

obtained if the comet's original orbit actually intersects the planet's orbit at

an angle of 45°, and if the comet is due first at the point of intersection at
the instant when the planet's distance therefrom is equal to the plaiiefs

distance from the sun multiplied by the ratio of the m.ass of the planet to the

inass of the sun.

     The relative velocity of the comet on leaving the planet's sphere of

action would be equal to, and directly opposite, the planet's velocity

^(s 1), and the comet would be left entirely at rest to fall to the sun.

This case could not happen for planets like the earth where mr is less

than the semi-diameter of the planet. In the case of the earth mr is less

than 300 miles, and actual collision would result. But for Jupiter mr is

greater than the distance of the second satellite from the planet. The
--nearest approach of the comet to the planet would be mr (y 2 1), which

is more than four times the radius of Jupiter. Hence this case of

maximum diminution of major axis could occur near Jupiter.

we find that the number of comets which, in a given period of time, come
nearer to the sun than r is to the number that (unperturbed) come nearer
to the planet than r' as ^f- is to 7*"'^. The factor | expresses the increase
of numbers caused by the planet's motion in its circular orbit. The value

HOEplane  contain the shortest line d between the two orbits. This d

will be the abscissa of the point at which the comet's unpertui-bed orbit

will cut the plane. The ordinate of the same point, produced if necessary,

will be the projection of the comet's path upon the plane HOB, and the

comet's path makes with the plane the angle 6. The velocity of the

comet perpendicular to the plane will be y^ sin 0. By reason of the

hypothesis that the comets are equably distributed, the points of intersec-

HOEtion with the plane  will be equably distributed over the plane.

Hence the number of comets whose quits are in the element rfS of the

celestial sphere and that will pass the planet in a unit of time in such a

way as to have their periodic times reduced below a given period will be

equal to the area inclosed in the corresponding isergonal curve multiplied

by the velocity perpendicular to the plane, v^ sin Q, and by the factor

time shall pass the planet in such way as that they shall have after the

pas.sage respectively less than one-half, once, three-halves, and twice, the
@ =planet's period of revolution, we may place

given in the last article. The results are found to be irnmh'^v multiplied

severally by the coefficients 0'139, 0-925, 1-876, and 2-943.

34. By comparing the results of Arts. 27 and 33, and making the

assumptions of Art. 26, we have the proposition, that the number of

comets which in a given period of time pass their perihelia nearer to the sun
than a given planet is to the number of comets whose periodic times are

reduced by the perturbing action of the planet so as to be less severally than
one-half once, three-halves, and twice, the periodic time of the planet, as

unify is- fo the square of the mass of the planet m^dtiplied severally by 0-139,
U-Sr2>), 1-H76, and 2-943.

    35. If Jupiter is the planet, m=y^Vo) ^^^ ^^ TM^y express these

ratios as

           1 000 000 000 : 126 : 839 : 1701 : 2670.

That is, assuming the hypotheses of Art. 26, and regarding the planet as

without dimension so as to intercept any comets, if in a given period of

time a thousand millioti comets come in parabolic orbits nearer to the sun

than Jupiter, 126 of them will have their orbits changed into ellipses with
periodic times less than one-half that of J^ipiter ; 839 of them will have their

orbits changed into ellipses with periodic times less than than that of

Jupiter; 1,701 of them will have their orbits changed into ellipses with
periodic times less than once and a half tim.es that of Jupiter ; and 2,670

of them will have their orbits changed into ellipses with periodic times less

than twice that of Jupiter.

     36. Another and perhaps a more important inquiry is this, what

effect have the perturbations of the planet in bringing or not bringing

the comets to move in the same direction that the planet is moving after

the comets have by perturbation had their periodic times largely reduced ?

For simplicity and as a special example I shall consider the action of

Jupiter only, and also only his action upon those comets whose periodic

times are reduced to be less than Jupiter's period, the original orbits of

the comets being parabolic. In other words, how many of the 839

comets which, are reduced (Art. 35) to have periodic times less than

Jupiter's period will after perturbation have goals distant less than 15°,

30°, 45°, &c., severally from Jupiter's goal ?

velocity of the comet about the sun after perturbation will evidently be

Asented by a line to from some point in the arc KH, if diminished by a line

d and h represent points outside that isergonal curve will after pertur-

Abation have directions of motion represented by lines drawn to from

Alines to from points in ET will be proportional to the area of the

@<rcomets which are thus limited and at the same time have      will be

the distance between the quits of the two bodies is between the two

then if c?oj" be made 15° the numbers in the second or third columns of

Table III. indicate how many quits are in the several zones of 15° on the

celestial sphere. These may be distributed at smaller intervals than 15°

by known processes. All the quits that lie in the luno between two semi-

circles drawn through S, so as to make angles of 30° with QS, will evi-
=dently have orbits inclined less than 30° to Jupiter's orbit. From m"

the portion of the quits in any elemental zone that fall in the lune is to

the whole number of quits in that elemental zone as this value of r) is to

90°. These may be summed by finite summation, and the result is that

among the 839 comets 257 would move in orbits inclined less than 30° to

the orbit of Jupiter.

    42. If a like summation be made for the equal lune that contains
Jupiter's goal we find 51 to be the number out of the 839 comets which
move in orbits inclined more than 150° to Jupiter's orbit. That is, some-
what more than five times as mamj of these comets move in direct orhits
inclined less than 30° to Jupiter's orhit as move in retrograde orhits inclined

lets than 30° to Jupiter's orhit.

    43. The comet has been thus far considered as approaching Jupiter

while moving in a parabolic orbit about the sun. If the comet, however,

is moving in any other orbit, and it passes near to the planet, the result
of the planet's perturbing action will in general be quite similar to the
result when the orbit is parabolic, the other circumstances of the approach
being assumed to be alike in the two cases.

     44. These are perturbations during one transit past the planet. But
the comet, unless the orbit is further changed by another planet, must
return at each revolution to the place where it encountered Jupiter. At
some time Jupiter will be nigh that place nearly at the same time as the

comet, and the comet will suffer a new, and perhaps a large perturbation.
Its period will again be changed, being shortened or lengthened according
as the comet passes before or behind the planet. This process will be
repeated again and again, since after any number of encounters the new

orbit of the comet will still pass near to the orbit of the planet.

This repeated action makes it possible to have an orbit shortened in

period by several passages near to Jupiter instead of its being done at

Aone passage.  much larger proportion of comets than 839 ont of

1,000,000,000 might therefore have their periodic times reduced below

the period of Jupiter.

     45. If the comet's orbit is largely inclined to the ecliptic, and hence

its motion makes a large angle with that of Jupiter, the diagrams figs.

10-18 show that there is nearly an even chance that the velocity will be

Aincreased or diminished.  considerable fractional part of the whole

number of such comets will at each passage be thrown out of the solar

system altogether, or thrown into such long orbits that they will return

only at very great intervals of time. This class of comets cannot be there-

fore regarded as permanent members of the family of short period comets,

except such of them as happen to come so near to other planets as to

have their orbits changed in such wise that they do not ha^'e thereafter
the near approach to Jupiter's orbit. Bat when an orbit is greatly in-

clined to the plane of the solar system the comet passes through the

plane in general at a considerable angle, and the chance of coming close

to another planet is relatively small.

                                                                     M SI 2
--532
KEPOBT 1891.

    46. On the other hand all the comets which after perturbation are

moving in orbits somewbat but not greatly inclined to the ecliptic are
liable to meet, in fact are sooner or later almost certain to meet, other
planets in such a way as to suffer perturbations that will prevent future
close encounters with Jupiter. After such changes those comets must
be regarded as tolerably permanent members of the solar system.

     47. Comets that have motions not greatly inclined to Jupiter's motion
are, as figs. 2 and 4 show, more likely in subsequent passages near to

Jupiter to have their periodic times shortened than lengthened. On the

contrary those passing in nearly opposite direction to Jupiter's motion

will, as figs. 3, 5, and 7 show, be much more likely to have their periods

lengthened than shortened.
     All these causes combine and work together to the one end that those

comets which are changed by the perturbing action of Jupiter, or other

planets, from parabolic orbits of every possible inclination to the ecliptic
into short period ellipses, and become permanent members of the solar
system, will as a rule (but with exceptions) move in orbits of moderate
inclination to the ecliptic, and with direct motions.

    We know as a fact that most short period comets do move in orbits

having small inclinations and direct motions, while long period and para-
bolic comets move at all possible inclinations to the ecliptic. If the short
period comets have been changed by Jupiter and other planets from

parabolic orbits, the preceding investigation shows why their orbits have
now small inclinations to the ecliptic, and the comets themselves have

direct motions.

The Recent Progress of Agriculture in India. By C. L. Tupper.

     [A Communication ordered by the Council to be printed in extenso among

                                                          the Reports.]

Since 1884-5 the Revenue and Agricultural Department of the Govern-

ment of India has published very comprehensive returns of the agricul-

tural statistics of British India, showing from year to year the area irri-

gated by Government canals, the acreage under cereals and pulses, fibres,

and other crops, the total area cropped, and many other particulars. I
have abstracted some leading figui-es from these returns, and append my

abstracts to this paper.
     It will be observed that in the period of six years, from 1884-5 to

1889-90, comprised in these returns the total cultivated area has risen

from 126 million acres to 136 million acres. I give the increase in
round numbers, and I propose throughout the text of this paper to use

round numbers only, showing the most precise figures I can get, either
in footnotes or in the appended abstracts from the returns. The figures
of 1884-5 necessarily do not include Upper Burraah, nor do they include
Ajmere, or the pargana, or tract known as Manpur in Central India.

Accordingly, to arrive at the total increase of cultivation in the six years,
Wewe must deduct for these localities some three million acres.
                                                                 thus

arrive at an increase of seven million acres, or a little more than one

million acres a year. The population of India now amounts to 286

millions, of which 220^ millions live in British territory and 65^ millions

in the protected native states. In the decade 1881 to 1891 the increase

has been 29 millions. But if we take only British territory, and exclncle
Upper Burmah as a fresh acquisition, it appears that the population has
risen by nearly 19 millions,' or by 14^ millions if we exclude Bengal,

which it is necessary to do because the Bengal figures are omitted from

the returns, the land revenue system which obtains in Bengal affording
no facilities for their compilation. The proportionate increase in the

area under review during the six years comprised in the returns would
be about 8,700,000; so that for each extra mouth to be fed we have
nearly 'SI acre of additional cultivation. This is not much, seeing that,
according to the figures given by the Famine Commission in 1880, the

ratios of the cropped area in the principal provinces ranged from "88 of

an acre per head in the Novth-West Provinces to 1"9 acres in the Central

Provinces.

The second statement I have prepared (Statement B) shows the

extension of the irrigated area during the same six years. The increase
due to the inclusion of Upper Burmah is 40U,000 acres, so that the exten-
sion of the irrigated area in India generally, less Bengal, may be taken

at 4^ million acres, from 23 million in 1885-6 to 27^ million in 1889-90.^

--The figures include all sources of water supply Government and private

canals, tanks, wells, and hill streams. It is not possible to state with

precision the portion of this area which is iri'igated by Government canals
because the Bombay returns of land irrigated in that way include also

the acreage watered from canals which are the property of pi-ivate

persons. But I may estimate the area irrigated by Government canals

at nine million acres. The Famine Commissioners assumed that an acre
of irrigated land can produce enough food to support 25 people. It is

safe to suppose that at least 2^ million out of the 4| million acres newly

brought under irrigation were unfilled before, thus allowing 2 million

acres as old cultivation now improved by being ii'rigated. On these

data, with the additional assumption that one unirrigated acre will yield

enough food for one person in the year, we may calculate that 4^ million

acres of fresh irrigation will produce enough food for 9j million people.
I have shown that the increase of the cultivated area, irrigated and

-- --unirrigated, amounts to seven million acres ; so that, on the supposition
   too favourable a one that the whole addition to the tilled breadth is
given to food crops, we have an additional food supply for 11;| millions
to set against an actual increase of 8,700,000 in the population. Without

pretending that this result possesses any greater degree of accuracy than

is warranted by the nature of the returns and suppositions on which it is

founded, I think it a safe genex'al conclusion that the agi-icultural deve-

lopment which is implied in the extension of cultivation and the extension

of irrigation keep pace, and do not do much more than keep pace with

the simultaneous increase in the numbers of the people.

This  is    not  a  stai-tling  conclusion and                                              it  is  one,  I  think,  to  be
                                                                                         ;

weighed with sobriety of judgment, with a mind neither specially elated

nor unduly depressed. There are physical limits, of course, to the exten-

sion of cultivation, and to the application of that most obvious and in
many places, but not in all, most useful of Indian agricultural improve-

--ments the supply of artificial irrigation to di'y areas by means of wells or

canals. There are considerable parts of India, such as the Patna and
Bnrdwan Divisions of Bengal, the Benares Division, and the Lower and
Middle Dotib in the North- West Provinces, with parts of Rohilkhand
and Oadh, and two or three of the most populous districts in the Punjab,
where the population is already so dense that it presses closely on the
means of subsistence. Elsewhere it is important to distinguish between
the wastes already included in village areas, used as common grazing
grounds for cattle, and great unoccupied blocks of arable land available
for new settlers. Village grazing lands are to be found practically
everywhere. In British India there are only a few well-defined tracts fit
for settlers, though of some of these the ai'eas are enormous. In the
southern plains of the Punjab, betvveen the great rivers, there are some
eight or nine million acres of fairly fertile soil, ready for cultivation, if
only water can be given to them. In the Central Px'ovinces the Famine
Commissioners mentioned two tracts, one in the western end of the
Nei'budda Valley and the other in the eastern, or Chatisgarh Division,
to which the attention of immigrants might be directed. In Assam and
Bnrmah there is a vast extent of culturable land. I cannot do better

--here than quote the report of the Famine Commission, from which these

facts are derived : ' There is,' it says, ' outside the congested tracts, in
most villages, scope for a slow and gradual extension of cultivation by
the breaking up of uncultivated land, and for the more careful cultivation,

of what is now under tillage, and outside the village areas there is an
immense extent of land which is more or less fit for cultivation. But
much of it is poor land, and where it is not poor either the climate is

feverish or else the conditions are so difi'erent from those that prevail in
the densely populated places from which emigration might be desired or
expected to come that settlers would be alarmed and discouraged. Pro-
bably the only tracts to which these objections do not apply are the
desert waste plains between the Punjab rivers and along the Indus, in
which, if irrigation is ever introduced, cultivation can be carried on under

much the same conditions as those which prevail in the greater part of
Upper India.'

     Any such attempt as this to convey in the space of less than half an

hour some prominent facts connected with any recent development of
agriculture in India must almost necessarily start from the admii-able
 report in which the remarks I have just quoted were made. That report
 gathered into a focus all the light then available as to Indian agriculture,
 and it has been diffusing it ever since. I draw special attention to the
 conclusions of the Famine Commissioners as regards the waste lands

between the great Punjab rivers because I am anxious to point out that

 the Government of India is fully alive to what is probably the greatest
 agricultural improvement that it is at present within its power to eflTect,
 and that the Local Government concerned and its officers are energetically
 co-operating in the endeavour to bring about that improvement in a
 satisfactory way. In every one of the vast interspaces between the
 Punjab rivers, including the space between the Swat and Cabul Rivers and
the Indus, we now have either important irrigation canals or projects for
 such canals sanctioned or unsanctioned. It must not be supposed that
 this is any direct result of the recommendations of the Famine Commis-

sion. Two of the pei-manent canals, the Bari Doab and the "Western

 Jumna, are of old date ; and the Swat River Canal was planned and the
ON THE DECENT PROGRESS OF AGRICULTURE IN INDIA.  535

Sii'liind Canal was under construction years before that famine in southern

India which led to the appointment of the Commission. Still the recom-

mendations of the Commission coincided with conclusions locally well

known and already in process of practical acceptance. I append a state-

ment (Statement C) of the perennial canals in the Punjab constructed and

under construction. I have to add that for the space between the Indus

and the combined Jhelum and Chenab there were projects not yet sanc-

tioned, so far as I know, when I left India ; while, further north, between

these two rivers, the Jhelum Canal, already sanctioned, had been begun:

this work, for reasons on which I need not enter here, had been tempo-

rarily discontinued. All the other Doabs, or spaces between the rivers,

are accounted for in the appended statement.

In addition to these perennial canals there are, both in the Punjab

and in Sindh, very numerous inundation canals. These are cuts of

simple construction filled by the flood waters of the Sutlej, Chenab,
and Indus, as the rivers rise in the late summer and autumn. Some of

these, notably the MuzafFargarh canals, have been greatly improved of

late years, and new ones, such as the Sohag and Para and Sidhnai, have

been constructed. Here we have been able to induce cultivators from

crowded districts to settle on virgin soil, and the success of the measures

taken has been very great. The system of tenure and allotments which
has given this result was devised by the late Colonel Wace and put into

execution by Lieut.-Colonel Hutchinson. I believe it to possess great

importance as a precedent, not only with reference to the spread of irriga-

tion to other waste lands in the Punjab, but also with reference to other

parts of India where the cultivating settlement of immigrants may be

contemplated as a possibility. The area irrigated by inundation canals

in Sindh is, I believe, about 1,800,000 acres. In the Punjab it was some

930,000 acres at the date of the report of the Famine Commission, and is

by the latest returns 1,242,000 acres.

     Of the 27i million acres shown as irrigated nearly 10 million acres
are irrigated by wells. It is in the alluvial soil of upper India that a
water-bearing stratum is found from 10 to 40 feet below the surface, and

the irrigation of crops by means of wells is commonly seen along the

courses of the rivers of the Indus and Ganges systems. In the uplands

of the spaces between the Punjab rivers the depth of the water-table from

the surface is so great that well-sinking becomes an unprofitable venture.

In the Central Provinces, Berar, the Bombay Deccan and parts of Madras
the subsoil is often rocky and the use of wells is much restricted. I have

prepared a return (Statement D) showing the area irrigated by wells in

Madras, the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, and the Punjab, with

the totals including other provinces, for the five years ending with

1889-90. This shows a steady and general improvement, the area having

risen in every province almost year by year, and having increased on the

whole from some 8,750,000 acres in 1885-6 to nearly 10 million acres in

An1889-90.  increase of 1;^ million acres of cultivation from wells is

valuable, not only because this additional area is thus secured from famine,

and enabled to produce better and more valuable crops, but because these

improvements are made by private persons at their own cost, and are thus

evidence of enterprise and security of tenure.

Before I leave the returns showing the extension of cultivation there

are two further remarks I wish to make ; which I owe partly to Mr.

O'Conor's ' Review of the Trade of India for 1888-9 ' and partly to a
536 EEPOET-- 1891.

speech I not long ago heard made by Mr. H. J. S. Cotton, one of the Secre-

taries to the Bengal Government, at a meeting of the East India Associa-

tion. It is obvious that the mere extension of the cultivated area is not

necessarily a good thing in itself. If poorer soils, with a precarious rain-

fall and no other means of irrigation, are broken up and barely supply the

"wants of an increasing population, this merely means a spread of the

insecure area already liable to famine. Now in the case of the Punjab

canals, which I mentioned just now, water is being brought to virgin

soils ; and we hope that, as far as possible, the land allotments will be

taken up by incoming settlers from congested districts. All this is, I

think, unmixed gain.

The other remark is that the changes which have taken place in Indian

trade must necessarily produce corresponding changes in Indian agricul-

ture. The historic exports of India, such as spices, silk, lac, and dye stuffs,,
now take a secondary place; opium and indigo still hold their ground, but

the rapid advance in the export trade is of recent origin and is based upon

the European demand for Indian raw products. The great export of

cotton followed the American War of Secession (1861-5). The export

of jute practically began after the Crimean War. ' The seed trade,' Mr.

O'Conor says, ' and the trade in wheat and rice took their present large

proportions only after the opening of the Suez Canal. The great tea

trade and the trade in coffee are the creations of the last quarter of a

century. So with the exports of hides and skins, wool and timber.' It

is a question for experts whether, in taking raw products and returning

cotton piece goods of English manufacture, we do not slowly add to the-

impoverishment of the soil. The remedy for the evil, if evil there be, is

doubtless to be found in greater diversity of occupations. Thei'e is a

beginning in this ; of the 114 cotton mills and 26 jute and hemp mills
now at work in India not one existed in 1848 and nearly all have been

started within the last twenty years.

Some of the most valuable recommendations of the Famine Com-

mission had reference to the relations of proprietors and tenants. The

Commission urged that, where this was not already suflBciently provided by

law, guarantees should be accorded to the landed classes that they shoul'd

without hindrance enjoy the fruits of improvements made at their own

expense. In the case of those persons who pay the land revenue direct

to Government, all of them, though called by different names and holding

tenures of different kinds in different parts of the country, have always-

under British rule, at least during the present century, had the benefit of

security of tenure. In many parts of the country, particularly in portions

of Northern and Western India, where the old Hindu institutions success-

fully reasserted themselves against Muhammadan supremacy, or where

that supremacy was never effectual, or where wise ^luhammadan em-

perors or governors laid down fairly lasting lines of revenue administra-

tion conceived in the Hindu spirit, the revenue- payers are very commonly,

though by no means invariably, themselves the actual cultivators, and a

class of tenants interposed between them and the soil, though it occurs,

IS not general.  Even in these  provinces  there is a tenant  question                                         the
                                                                                                            ;

stratification of Indian society, indeed, bears witness almost everywhere

to the superposition of race upon race, or tribe upon tribe, due doubtless

to untold ages of internal warfare and successive invasions of new

tribes or races from without. In other parts of the country we foun-d

the old state of things terribly confused and almost entirely obliterated

by the misrule of the mushroom Muhammadan governmerits that spi-ang'

up outside the spheres of influence of the Sikhs and Mahrattas in the

wide ruins left by the downfall of the Delhi Empire. The ei'uel and

grasping expedient of farming the revenues adopted by our unscrupulous

predecessors, and continued for a space by ourselves when we had not

the knowledge or experience to enable us to dispense with it, left us in

large jiroviiices a tangled web of tenures which we are only now getting

straiglat. Since 1880, when the Famine Commissioners submitted their

report, the whole law of landlord and tenant has been thoroughly recon.

sidered, both in the light of their recommendations and in accordance

with local needs and proposals, in Bengal, in the North-West Provinces,

in Ondh,  in the Punjab, and in the  Central  Provinces                                                         that is,  the  best
                                                                                                             ;

efforts of the Government and of the most competent officials and other

persons whom it could consult have been given to the amelioration of

land tenure in the whole of Northern India, so far as it is British, from

the Himalaya to far below the Nerbudda and Tapti, and from Peshawar

almost to Manipur. In the same period the land revenue law, that is,

the law for the assessment and collection of the land revenue, vitally

affecting the economic conditions of the country, has been carefully

revised in the Central Provinces and the Punjab. How extensive and

how onerous these tasks have been few know besides those who have-
had to deal with them. To my mind they are, in their successful com-

pletion, agricultural improvements of the first consequence ; and nO'

economist can impute to the State misguided intervention here. N©

hand but that of the law could hold the balance between the conflicting

interests of those who draw their livelihood from the soil, and who have

learnt from our inevitable accentuation of individual right, derived from

Western theories of legal equality, to enforce, by legal processes, in

novel and powerful courts of justice, their antagonistic claims. Nor

could any authority but that of the State itself determine from time to

time the most suitable methods of assessing and collecting that public

demand, wholly unlike any impost in this country, which may, according

to our point of view, be described as a land-tax or a State rental.

There was another set of proposals made by the Famine Commissioners

which has produced and is producing very important effects in India.

As they advised, the Eevenue and Agi'icultural Department of the

Supreme Government, which had been temporarily in abeyance, was

quickly revived. In all the great provinces officers have been appointed

under the designation of directors of land records and agriculture, or of

commissioners of settlements and agriculture, whose duty it is, under

the Local Governments and Administrations, to supervise the detailed

execution of that policy of agricultural inquiry upon which it was a main

object of the Famine Commissioners to insist. It is a recommendation

of that policy that it is founded on native institutions of great antiquity

and wide extent ; and it is only so far new that it utilises them for

beneficent purposes that were unknown to our predecessors, and too

little realised by ourselves, until the examination of the evidence con-

nected with a series of famines produced the abiding conviction that tbe

effort to prevent or circumscribe, or at least to mitigate, those disastrous

evils is amongst the first duties of the State in India. Wherever a just

and careful assessment of the land-revenue demand has been made in

temporarily settled districts, the basis of it has been sound agricultural

inquiry. Practically the Famine Commissioners may be said to have
--538 EEPOET 1891.

 pointed out that the sort of knowledge of the agricultural conditions of
an Indian district necessarily gathered by an assessing officer in the
process of fixing the land-revenue demand for a term of years ought, for
 the proper administration of the charge, to be continuously available
during that term of years to every officer in charge of a district. The
 foundation of this knowledge is the returns and records which are
annually prepared by the village accountants-- officials, usually hereditary
officials, who have existed in India for ages before our time. Attention
has therefore been directed to the improvement of this indigenous
 agency and to its more effective supervision in each district by a staff of
 native officials acting under the orders of the district officer and his
 principal assistants. The object in view has been to provide for each village
 a record, always kept up to date, of all essential particulars bearing on
its agricultural efficiency, so that from harvest to harvest the i-esponsible

functionaries may be supplied with sufficient and trustworthy infor-

 mation as to the extent and character of the crops grown, as to the
 prosperous or depressed condition of the peasantry, and as to any risk

there may be of famine or scarcity. In this way, if famine comes, it will

 take no one by surprise, and those concerned will be able to battle with
 it to the best advantage, because they will possess detailed knowledge of
the actual circumstances of particular tracts. If scarcity comes, not
amounting to famine, the district officer by timely suspensions or re-
missions of the laud-revenue demand, or by the institution of timely

relief works, if required, may be able to avert that terrible weakening of
the health of the people, due to hard times, which when the sickly
autumn months come round culminates in appalling mortality. If there

is neither famine nor scarcity the continuous maintenance of correct

records of the state of agriculture will enable the next reassessment of

the land revenue to be made with speed, and in proportion as the whole
system is efficient, the people will be spared, at intervals of twenty or

thirty years, the harassment of inquiries by a small army of strange
officials, and that cruel drag upon agricultural improvement which

consists of prolonged uncertainty as to the rate of land-tax or State rent
that they will have to pay.

     If the fii-st great work which in part resulted from, or at least was
lai'gely influenced by, the labours of the Famine Commission was the
revision of the law of landlord and tenant in Upper India, the second
great work has been this thorough and extensive organisation of agri-
cultural inquiry which I have been endeavouring to describe. There is
a third great wox-k which deserves mention, though it is not really com-
parable in extent and complexity with the other two. In each province
^ famine code has been prepared which will serve as a manual of famine

relief for the guidance of all concerned on the next occurrence of famine.
I have already explained that due regard is being paid to the extension

of canal irrigation. As to railway extension, as probably the most

powerful of all prophylactics against famine, I leave that subject for the
next paper, which is to deal with recent improvements in communi-

cations. I will only remark, lest I appear to have overlooked so very
important an item in agricultural conditions, that in India generally,
including native states, there were 8,492 miles of railway open in 1879-
80, and that there were open in 1889-90 (by the last return), 16,097
miles. The railway mileage has thus been nearly doubled in eleven years.

     I suppose I ought also to say a very few words on what are known as
ON THE EECENT TROGRESS OF AGRICULTURE IN INDIA.            539

agjriculfcural improvements in this country of peace and plenty, where, in

these days, famine never comes, and where farming is a bnsiness con-

ducted on business principles, not the sole means of subsistence for the

vast mass of the population. Tou will anticipate the general drift of my

remarks when I say that I agree with those who hold that we have far

more to learn from the Indian peasant about Indian agriculture than,
ven with the resources of science at command, we are at all likely,

for some time to come, to be able to teach him. Reforms have been

--attempted the introduction of new crops, improvements in the methods

of cultivating the ordinary crops of the country, the adaptation of English

or other machinery to Indian conditions, and the breeding of cattle.

Anything I might tell you under these heads would be a mere repetition,

of what is said in Part II. of the ' Report of the Famine Commission,'

--pp. 137-9. Of the important staples successfully introduced viz., tea,

coffee, the Mauritius sugar cane, New Orleans cotton, cinchona, and

--potatoes it may, however, be interesting to mention, in connection with

British trade, the areas now cultivated with coffee and tea. The coffee

area has slightly contracted. It was some 121,000 acres in 1884-5, and

some 118,000 in 1889-90. In the same period the area under tea has

risen from nearly 130,000 acres to more than 250,000. In my own pro-

vince, the Punjab, the breed of horses has certainly been improved within

my recollection. For the rest, I will only say that the Indian agricul-

turist is well aware of the value of manure, but with reference to the

vast distances that have to be traversed, and to some other considerations,

either could not afford to buy or would be unwilling to use imported

manures, while he wants a great part of his farmyard manure for fuel.

There are many practical difficulties in the way of the employment of

English ploughs and of deep ploughing ; and expensive machines worked

by steam, which could not be mended by village blacksmiths, are out of

the question for peasant holders of small plots scattered in villages over

the face of a vast, very primitive country. The most that can be said, I

think, is that the Indian peasant may possibly plough deep, use more

manure, and abstain from drenching the soil with all the water he can

let on to it, when he is convinced that an alteration of practice in these

Werespects will be profitable to himself in his lifetime.  have hitherto

entirely failed to demonstrate to his satisfaction the pecuniary advantage

of a change. Our efforts, too, in technical education in agriculture have

not, so far, either reached or formed the practical farmer. They have

merely resulted in a new brood of hungry aspirants for employment as

 officials.

    I hope that in the space I have at my disposal I have been able to

make it sufficiently clear that in speaking of such a primitive country as
India we cannot use such an expression as the development of agricul-
ture in quite the same sense in which we apply it to the highly cultivated
and civilised countries of Europe at the present day. Famine, it has
been well said, is one of the diseases of the infancy of nations ; and at

present our best efforts are needed rather to prevent or mitigate that
sudden and terrible deterioration of agriculture which is implied in
famine than to convert the empiricism of a thousand generations to
Western beliefs in scientific farming. I do not deny that to improve
agricultural methods is a part of the means of famine prevention ; but I
would add that another disease of the infancy of nations is chronic war.

To England, to this land of ours where there is indeed much poverty,
--540 REPOET 1891.

famine, as I have said, never comes, pestilence but rarely, and we have
almost forgotten that the fire and sword of the invader or freebooter were
for centuries part of the ordinary lot of human kind. Those touching
and familiar supplications for deliverance from plague, pestilence and
famine, from battle and mui'der, and that peace may be given in our time,
have happily lost here that sort of significance which attaches to an
attempt to ward off" evils known in all their bitterness by personal and

recent experience. In India we are far nearer to the actual conditions
of society which existed when that litany was framed upon which oura
was largely modelled. In India we have given the land peace and that

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

is, indeed, one of the greatest of all agricultural improvements, as any-

one knows well enough who has seen on or beyond the Indian north-
west frontier ai'med men ploughing their fields, armed shepherds and

graziers pasturing their flocks, and the village towers of refuge dotted

about the village lands, lest perchance there should come some band of

Weraiders too strong to be dealt with in the open plain.                                                                                              have given

Wethe land peace and must maintain it. That alone is no light task.

must also decide justly those conflicting claims of various sections of

the people which have arisen in part from the imposition of civilised rule

upon primitive societies and in part from centuries of incessant violence

and war                                          and we must                                                      be  prepared  to  face  pestilence  and famine, and
                                              ;

when they come, to do our best to mitigate their ravages. I do not say

that in securing all this we should neglect agricultural chemistry and

experimental farms. I only say that in promoting these means of agri-
cultural improvement we must not forget their relative importance in
view of some of the first duties which Indian Governments have to dis-

charge.

In India three important committees have lately assembled to consider

Aagricultural affairs.                                                                                            Bombay committee, which i-eported on July 8,

1890, recommended an increase in the number of experimental farms, the

establishment of cattle farms, and an increased expenditure on seed for

distribution and improved machinery and implements. The Madras
Government on the 4th of the same month, reviewing the report of the
Madras Committee, condemned in some lively sarcasms the operations of
the past, noting that the amount of real good secured had been infinitesi-
mal, and that the greater part of the money which had been spent on

agricultural improvement and education in the Madras Presidency had

been thrown away. A project was approved for the estabhshment of

combined agricultural schools and farms at or near the headquarters of

five representative districts, the College of Agriculture was to be main-
tained with some improvements in its course, and the branch of the

Agricultural Department which dealt with cattle disease was to be abo-
lished. The third committee was held in October 1890 under the presi-
dency of Sir Edward Buck. It was mainly the outcome of the mission

of Dr. Voelcker, the agricultural chemist to the Rcj^al Agricultural Society

of England, who was deputed to India by the Secretary of State to

investigate the conditions under which action may usefully be taken in

connection with agricultural experiments in that country. The Com-

mittee proposed the appointment of an agricultural chemist in India for

a term of                                        seven years                                                      the maintenance   in  each province of a system of
                                                                                                               ;

farms for inquiry and experiment ; the better extension of primary

education amongst the agricultural classes ; and the combination of

instruction in agriculture with the existing course of instruction. In

several of these matters past experience alone would hardly jastify any-
sanguine expectation of great results. But let us trust that the sober

and serious spirit of resolve to try again with more system and with a

--frank recognition of past mistakes a spirit which, I thiuk, may be said
--to characterise all these proceedings may lead in course of time to

improvements which will, at all events, beat the past record. I will

venture to add a suggestion for the consideration of the authorities.

More than a decade has now elapsed since the submission of the Report of

the Famine Commission. It contained a vast number of detailed proposals.

I have not troubled you to-day with more than a very few of the leading

heads, but I may mention that the second part of the report, dealing with

measures of protection against fanaine and its prevention, suggests a great
number of administrative changes, many of which have since come under

separate consideration. I may instance the general organisation of the

--superior official staff- since the subject of the labours of the Public Service

Commission ; the relations of landlord and tenant ; the assessment and
collection of the land revenue ; the indebtedness of the landed classes ; the
policy of Government in regard to railways and canals, emigration, and

forest  conservancy                                                          and  the encouragement of  diversity in occupations.
                                                                          ;

Would it not be a good employment for the next Agricultural Committee

assembled in India to refer one by one to all the proposals in the second

part of the report of the Famine Commission that were approved by the

Secretary of State, and to report, for the information of Government and

the public, what proposals have been carried out and in what manner,

what still remain for consideration, and whether any of these should be

taken up and put into execution now ? As a study of Indian agricultural

conditions and of the principal problems bearing upon agriculture in

India, I do not think it likely that the i-eport of the Famine Commissioners

will, in this generation, be excelled ; and I am sure all who have looked
into that most valuable record will agree with me that very full justice

should be done to the great knowledge of Indian life, character, physical

surroundings, and possibilities which it displays throughout. Sir Edward

Buck, in his address to the Committee of October last, was careful to

point out that the gradual establishment of a sound system of scientific

investigation and of education in connection with agriculture was the

next point to be taken up in the approved programme of the Famine

Commission. Without disputing that view or undervaluing in any way

the possibilities of important additions to knowledge and of improvement

which may result from the employment of a first-class expert, I merely

wish to draw attention to the wider measure of a general examination at

this date of the scheme of the Famine Commission considered as a whole.

The remarks made in this paper have necessarily been slight, and have

dealt much more with the conditions of Indian agriculture than with the

connection between Indian agriculture and British trade. I hope that

part of tbe subject will be more fully discussed by other speakers. If such

an examination of the viesvs of the Famine Commission as I have here

suggested be undertaken in India within the next two or three years, the

time spent on this paper will not, I ti'ust, prove to have been altogether

thrown away.

I will, in conclusion, refer to one proposal made by the Famine Com-

missioners which, I think, might be revived with advantage. At present

members of the Indian Civil Service are forbidden to hold land in the

provinces where they are employed. No doubt it is undesirable that
--542 EEPOET 1891.

Indian Civil Servants should farm for profit. They must not be distracted
from their official duties or have interests that might clash with those
duties, or be even open to suspicion of irregularities in dealings \rith
tenants or labourers or traders in produce. But these objections vpould
hardly apply to district officers permitted to hold small areas of 50 or 100
acres on lease for purposes of recreation and experiment. If this per-
mission vrere given to the comparatively few who would care to have it,
a good deal of practical experience of much value might be accumulated.

  --PllESIDENT OF THE SECTION Pl'ofesSOr OLIVER J. LODUE., D.SC, LL.D., F.E.S.

                             THURSDAY, AUGUST 20.

     The President delivered the following Address :

During the past year three or four events call for special mention in an annual
deliverance of this kind by a physicist.

     One is the Faraday centenary, which was kept in a happy and simple manner
by a cosmopolitan gathering in the place so long associated with his work, and by
discourses calling attention to the modern development of discoveries made by him.

     Another is the decease of the veteran Wilhelm Weber, one of the originators
of that absolute system of measurement which, though still hardly grasped in its
simplicity and completeness by the majority of men engaged in practice, nor even,
I fear, wholly understood by some of those engaged in University teaching, has yet
done so much, and is destined to do still more, for the unification of physical
science, and for a thorough comprehension of its range and its limitations.

   A third event of importance during the year is the discovery in America of a

binary system of stars, revolving round each other with grotesque haste, and with
a proximity to each other such as to render their ordinary optical separation quite
impossible. Ideas concerning the future of such systems, if, as seems probable,
their revolution period is shorter than their axial period, will readily suggest them-
selves, in accordance with the princi])les elaborated by Prof. George Darwin. The

subject more properly belongs to our President, but I may parenthetically exclaim
at the singular absurdity of the notion which was once propounded by a philoso-
pher, that motion of stars in our line of sight must for ever remain unknown to us
whereas the mere time of revolution of a satellite, compared with its distance from
its central body, is theoretically sufficient to give us information on this head. As

a matter of pedatrogy it is convenient to observe that the principle called Doppler's,

which is generally Imowu to apply to the periodic disturbances called Light and
Sound, applies equally to all periodic occurrences; and that the explanation of
anomalies of Jupiter's first satellite by Rr emer may be regarded as an instance of
J'oppler's principle.^ Any discrepancy between the observed and the calculated
times of revolution of stars round each other can possibly be explained by a
relative motion between us and the pair of bodies along the line of sight.

    If our text-books clearly recognised this, we should not so often lind exami-

nation candidates asserting that the apparent time of revolution of a satellite of
Jupiter depends on the distance of the earth from that planet, instead of on the speed.

    ' Dr. Huo^gins has just pointed out to me a perfectly clear statement to the

above effect in Professor Tait's little book on Light.
548 KEPOBT-- 1891.

I should indeed he floriy to he judged by the performance of mj' own students, but I
fear that many of the less obvious mistakes made by reasonably trained examination
candidates are more directly traceable to their teachers than some of ns as teachers

·would like to admit.

     The change in the Tefrangibility of light by reason of tlie motion of its
source, thou^rh familiar enough now, was at first regarded as too small to be
observed, and one or two attempts directed to detecting the effect of this principle
on the spectra of the stars, or sometimes on sunlight reflected by a 45° mirror into
the line of the earth's motion (which is not a possible method), wholly failed. I take
pleasure in remembering that this etfect was clearly observed for the firet time by the
gentleman we this year honour as our President ; and that it is by this v«ry means
that the latest sensational discovery in astronomy of the rapidly revolving twin
star ^-Aurig.'E, by Prof. Pickering and the staif connected with the Draper
Memorial, was made.

     The funds for the investigation that led to this result were provided by Mrs.
Draper, as a memorial to her late husband ; and if 3-Aurigfe does not constitute a
satisfactory memorial, I am at a loss to conceive the kind of tombstone which the
relations of a man of science would prefer.

    The fourth event to which it behoves me to refer is the practical discovery of
a physical method for colour photography. When I say practical I do not mean
commercial, nor do I know that it will ever become applicable to the ordinary
business of the photographer. Whether it does or not, it is a sound achievement
by physical means of a result which the chemical means hitherto tried failed, some

think necessarily failed, to produce. I say practical, because already it had been
suggested as possible theoretically; and a step toward it, indeed very near it, had
been actually made. The first suggestion of the method, so far as I know, was
made by Lord Rayleigh in the course of a mathematical paper on the reflection of
light, and with reference to some results of Becquerel obtained on a totally difterent
plan. Ht^ said in a note that if by normal reflection waves of light were converted
into stationary waves, the}' could shake out silver in strata half a wave-length
apart, and that such strata would give selective reflection and show iridescence.

     The colour of certaiu crystals of chlorate of potash, described in a precise
manner by Sir George Stokes,' and also the colours of opal and ancient glass, tad
been elaborately and completely explained by Lord Rayleigh on this theory of a
periodic structure (the laminated structure in the case of chlorate of potash being
caused by twinning^) ; and be subsequently illustrated it with sound and a series of
muslin discs one behind the other on a set of lazy-tongs. Each membrane re-
flected an inappreciable amount, but successive equidistant membranes reinforced
each other's action, and the entire set reflected distinctly one definite note, of wave-
length twice the distance between adjacent muslins. So also with any series of
equidistant strata each very slightly reflecting. They should give selective reflection,
and the spectrum of their reflected beam should show a single line or narrow band,
corresponding to a wave-length twice the distance of the strata apart.

various cases in which a laminated structure leads to a powerful but highly selected

reflection would be of value. The most frequent examples are met with in the organic

world It has occurred to me that Becquerel's reproduction of the spectrum in

natural colours upon silver plates may perhaps be explicable in this manner. The
various parts of the film of subchloride of silver with which the met.al is coated may

be conceived to be subjected during exposure to statimiary luminous waves of nearly

definite wave-length, the effect of which might be to impress upon the substance a

periodic structure occurririg at intervals equal to half the wave-length of light ; just
as a sensitive flame exposed to stationary sonorous waves is influenced at the loops, but

Tiot at the nodes {Pliii. Mag. March 1879, p. 153). In this way tlie operation of any

kind of light would be to produce just such a mollification of the film as would cause

it to reflect copiously that particular kind of light. I abstain at present from de-

veloping this suge^estion, in the hope of soon finding an opportunity of making my-

self experimentally acquainted with the subject.'

     Independently of all this, Herr Otto Wiener, imitating Hertz's experiments
with ordinary light, in 1889 reflected a beam directly back on itself, and, by inter-
posing a very thin collodion iilm at extraordinarily oblique incidence, succeeded in
the difficult experiment of so magnifj^ng by the cos^ine of inclination the half

wave-length, as to get the silver deposited iu strata of visible width, and thus to
photograph the interference nodes themselves at the places where they were cut by
the plane of the film.^

     Then M. Lippmann, using a thicker film, not put obliquely but normal to the

light, obtained the strata within the thickness of the film itself--hundreds of
layers ; and so, employing incidence light of definite wave-length, was able to pro-
duce a stratified depo&it, which reflected back at appropriate incidence the same
wave-length as produced it ; thus reproducing, of course, the definite colour.

      It is probable that the silver is first shaken out at the ventral segments, but
that the strata so formed are thick and blurry. I conjecture that by over-exposure
this deposit is nearly all mopped up again, traces being left only at the nodes,
where the action is very feeble and takes a long time to occur ; "but that these

residual strata, being fairly sharp and definite, would be likely to give much better
effects. And so I suppose that these are what are actually effective in obtaining
M. Lippmann's very interesting, though not yet practically useful, result.

  _ I now leave the retrospect of what has been done, although many other topics
might usefully detain us, and I proceed to glance forward at the progres.% ahead
and at the means we have for efl'ectively grappling with our due share of it.

  _ There is a subject which has long been in my mind, and which I determined to

bring forward whenever I had a cathedral opportunity of doing so ; and now, if

ever, is a suitable occasion. It is to call attention to the fact that the further

progress of physical science in the somewhat haphazard and amateur fashion in
which it has been hitherto pursued in this country is becoming increasingly difficult,

and that the quantitative portion especially should be undertaken in a permanent
and publicly-supported physical laboratory on a large scale. If such an establish-
ment were likely to weaken the sinews of private enterprise and individual research

it should be strenuously opposed; but, in my opinion, it would have the opposite
effect, by relieving the private worker of much which he can only undertake with

great difficulty, sacrifice, and expense. To illustrate more precisely what I
mean, it is sufficient to recall the ease of astronomy. The amateur astronomer has
much work lying ready to his hand, and he grapples with it manfully. To him is
left the striking out of new lines and the guerilla warfare of science. Skirmishing
and brilliant cavalry evolutions are his natural field : he should not be called upon

to take part in the general infantry advance. It is wasting his energies, and he

could not in the long run do it well. What, for instance, would have been the

-- --state of astronometry the nautical almanac department of astronomy without
the consecutive and systematic work of the National Observatory at Greenwich H
It may be that some enthusiastic amateurs would have devoted their hves to this

routine kind of work, and here at one time and there at another a series of accurate

observations would have been kept for several years. Pursued in that way, how-

ever, not only would the effort be spasmodic and temporarv, but the energy and

enthu-siasm of those amateurs would have been diverted from the pioneering more

suited to them, and would have been cramped in the e-roove of routine, eminently

adapted to a permanent official staff" but not wholesom^e for an individual.

Long-continued consecutive observations may be made by a leader of science,

as functions may be tabulated by an  eminent  mathematician                                                                      but if the work can

be done almost equally well (some would say better) by a professional observer or

pomputator, how great an economy results.

Now all this applies equally to physics. The ohm has been determined

with 4-figure,  perhaps  with  5-figure, accuracy                                                                    but  think  of the  list  of eminent
                                                                                                                  ;

tion, "^e must have a few specimens, and our leaders must show us the way to do

things. But let us not contmue to use them for such purposes much longer. The

quest of the fiftli or sixth decimal is a Tery legitimate, and may become a very

absorbing, quest, but there are plenty of the rank and file who can undertake it if

properly generalled and led : not as isolated iudiyiduals, but as workers in a

National Laboratory under a competent head and a governing committee. By tliis

means work far greater in quantity, and in the long run more exact in quality, can

be turned out, by patient and conscientious labour without much genius, by the

gradual improvement of instrumental means, by the skill acquired by practice, and

by the steady drudgery of routine. Paris has long had one form of such an

institution, in the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers, and has been able to impose tbe

metric system on the civilised world in consequence. It can also point to the classical

determinations of Regnault as the fruits of just such a system.  Berlin  is  now
                                                                                                                     .

starting a similar or a more ambitious scheme for a ])ermanent National Physical

Institute. Is it not time that England, who in physical science, I venture to think,

may in some sort claim a leading place, should be thinking of starting the same

movement ?

The Meteorological and Magnetic Observatory at Kew (in the inauguration of

which this Association took so large a part) is a step ; and much useful quantitative
work IS done there. The new Electric Standardizing Laboratory of the Board of

Trade is another and, in some respects perhaps, a still closer approximation to the

kind of thing I advocate. But what I want to see is a much larger establishment,

erected on the most suitable site, limited by no specialty of aim nor by the demands

of the commercial world, furnished with all appropriate appliances, to be amended

and added to as time goes on and experience grows, and invested with all the dignity

and permanence of a national institution : a Physical Observatory, in fact, precisely

comparable to the Greenwich Observatory, and aiming at the very highest quanti-

tative work in all departments of physical science. That tlie arts would be benefited

may be assumed without proof. It is largely the necessity of engineers that has

inspired the amount of accuracy in electrical matters already attained. The work

and appliances of the mechanical engineer eclipse the present achievements of the

physicist in point of accuracy, and it is by the aid of the mechanician and optician

that precision even in astronomy has reached so high a stage. There is no reason

·why physical determinations should be conducted in an amateur fashion, with

comparatively imperfect instruments, as at present they mostly are. Discoveries

lie along the path of extreme accuracy, and they will turn up in the most unex-

j>ected way. The aberration of light would not have been discovered had not

Bradley been able to measure to less than 1 part in 10,000; and what a brilliant and

momentous discovery it was ! He was aiming at the detection of stellar parallax,

but the finite velocity of light was a greater discovery than any parallax. This is

the type of result which sometimes lurks in the fifth decimal, and which confers

upon it an importance beside which the demands of men who wish to serve the taste

and the pocket of the British public sink into insignificance.

In a National Observatory accuracy should be the one great end : the utmost

accuracy in every determination that is decided on and made. Only one thing

should he more thought of than the fifth significant figure, and that is the sixth.

The consequences flowing from the results may safely be left ; such as are not
obvious at once will distil themselves out in time. And the great army of outside

physicists, assured of the good work being done at headquarters, will (to speak

again in astronomical parable) cease from peddling with taking transits or

altitudes, and will be free to discover comets, to invent the spectroscope, to watch

solar phenomena, to chemically analyse the stars, to devise celestial photography,

and to elaborate still more celestial theories ; all of which novelties may in

their maturity be handed over to the National Observatory, to be henceforth incor-

porated with, and made part of, its routine life ; leaving the advance guard and

skirmishers free to explore fresh territory, secure in the knowledge that what

they have acquired will be properly surveyed, mapped, and utilised, without further

attention from them. As to the practical applications, they may in any case be

left to take care of themselves. The instinct of humanity in this direction, and

the so-called solid gains associated with practical achievements, will always

secure a sufficient number of acute and energetic workers to turn the new territory

into aratle land and pasture adapted to the demands of the avei-age man. Tlie

labour of the agriculturist in rendering soil fertile is, of course, beyond praise
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

but it is not the work of the pioneer. As Mr. Huxley eloquently put it, when con-

trasting' the application of science with the advance of science itself, speakiii"-

--of the things of commercial value which the physical philosopher sometimes dis-

covers: 'Great is the rejoicing of those who are benefited thereby, and, for the
moment, science is the Diana of all the craftsmen. But even while the cries of

jubilation resound, and this flotsam and jetsam of the tide of investigation is being
turned into the wages of workmen and the wealth of capitalists, the crest of the
wave of scientific investigation is far away on its course over the illimitable ocean

of the unknown.'

I have spoken of the work of the National Laboratory as devoted to accuracy.

It is hardly necessary to .say that the laboratory will be also the natural custodian

of our standards, in a state fit for use and for comparison with copies sent to be

certified. Else perhaps some day our standard ohm may be buried in a brick wall
at Westminster, and no one living may be able to recall precisely where it is.

     But, in addition to these main functions, there is another, equally important
with them, to which I must briefly refer. There are many experiments which

cannot possibly be conducted by an individual, because forty or fifty years is not

--long enough for them. Such are secular experiments on the properties of materials
    the elasticity of metals, for instance ; the effect of time on molecular arranorement

the influence of long exposure to light, or to heat, or to mechanical vibration, or to

other physical agents.

     Does the permeability of soft iron decay with age, by reason of the gradual
cessation of its Amperian currents ? Do gases cool themselves when adiabatically

preserved, by reason of imperfect elasticity or too many degrees of freedom of their
molecules ? Unlikely, but not impossible. Do thermo-electric properties alter with

--time ? And a multitude of other experiments which appear specially applicable to

substances in the solid state ^a state which is more complicated, and has been

less investigated, than either the liquid or the gaseous : a state in which time and

past history play an important part.

Upon whichever of these long researches we may decide to enter, a National

Laboratory, with permanent traditions and a continuous life, is undoubtedly the only

appropriate place. At such a place as Glasgow the exceptional magnitude of a
present occupant may indeed inspire sufficient piety in a successor to secure the

continuance of what has been there begun                                                                                                                                                                                                  but in most college laboratories, under
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

conditions of migration, interregnum, and a newregitre, continuity of investigation

is hopeless.

I have at any rate said enough to indicate the kind of work for which the

establishment of a well-furnished laboratory -uath fully equipped staS' is desirable,

and I do not think that we, as a nation, shall be taking our proper share of the

highest scientific work of the world until such an institution is started on its career.

There is only one evil which, so far as I can see, is to be feared from it : if ever

it were allowed to impose on outside workers as a central authority, from which

infallible dicta were issued, it would be an evil so great that no amount of good

work carried on by it could be pleaded as sufficient mitigation.

competent to be independent, and to contemn the voice of authority speaking as

mere authority, if their only safeguard lies in the absence of necessity for struggle

and effort, they cannot long hope to escape from the futility which surely awaits

them in other directions.

    I am thus led to take a wider range, and, leaving temporary and special con-

siderations, to speak of a topic which is as yet beyond the pale of scientific orthodoxy,

and which I might, perhaps more wisely, leave lying by the roadside. I will,

however, take the risk of introducing a rather ill-favoured and disreputable looking

--stranger to your consideration, in the belief I might say, in the assured conviction
--that he is not all scamp, and that his present condition is as much due to our

long- continued neglect as to any inherent incapacity for improvement in the subject.
--552 REPORT 1891.

     I wish, however, strenuously to guard against its being supposed that this
Association, in its corporate capacity, lends its countenance to, or looks with

--any favour on, the outcast. What I have to say and after all it will not
--be" much must rest on my own responsibility. I should be very sorry for any

adventitious weight to attach to my observations on forbidden topics from the
accident of their being delivered from this chair. At the same time not only do I

claim the right to express myself concerning matters on which I have worked, but
I conceive it to be a duty, from which, if I shrank, I should shrink from no higher
motive than simple cowardice, fhough I know them to be topics on which it is quite
impossible, as well as undesirable, for everyone to think alike.

     It is but a platitude to say that our clear and conscious aim should always be truth,
and that no lower or meaner standard should ever be allowed to obtrude itself before
us. Our ancestors fought hard and suffered much for the privilege of free and open
inquiry, for the right of conduct ing investigation untrammelled by prej udice and fore-
gone conclusions, and they were ready to examine into any phenomenon which pre-
sented itself. This attitude of mind is perhaps necessarily less prominent now,
when so much knowledge has been gained, and when the labours of many indivi-
duals may be rightly directed entirely to its systematisation and to the study of its
inner ramifications ; but it would be a great pity if a too absorbed attention to what
has already been acquired, and to the fringe of territory lying immediately adjacent
thereto, were to end in our losing the power of raising our eyes "and receiving
evidence of a totally fresh kind, of perceiving the existence of regions into which the
same processes of inquiry as had proved so fruitful might be extended, with re-
sults at present incalculable and perhaps wholly unexpected. I myself think that
the ordinary processes of observation and experiment are establishing the exist-
ence of such a region ; that in fact they have already established the truth of some
phencimena not at present contemplated by science, and to which the orthodox man

shuts his ears.
      For instance, there is the question whether it has or has not been established

by direct experiment that a method of communication exists between mind and
mind irrespective of the ordinary channels of consciousness and the known organs
of sense, and if so, what is the process ? It can hardly be through some unknown
sense organ, but it may be by some direct physical influence on the ether, or it
may be in some still more subtle manner. Of the process I as yet know nothing.
Further investigation is wanted. No one can expect others to accept his woid for
au entirely new fact, except as establishing a prima facie case for investigation.

     But I am only now taking this as an instance of what I mean ; whether it be

 a truth or a fiction, I doubt if one of tlie recognised scientific societies would receive

--a paper on the subject. What I wish is to signalise a danger which I believe
--to be actual and serious that investigation in this and cognate subjects may be

 checked and hampered by active hostility to these researches on the part of the
 majority of scientific men, and a determined opposition to the reception or discus-

 sion of evidence.
      That individuals should decline to consider such matters is natural enough ; they

may be otherwise occupied and interested. Everybody is by no means bound to in-

 vestigate everything ; though, indeed, it is customary in most fields of knowledge

 for those who have kept aloof from a particular inquiry to defer in moderation to
those who have conducted it, without feeling themselves called upon to express an
 opinion. But it is not of the action of individuals that I wish to speak, it is of the
 attitude to be adopted by scientific bodies in their corporate capacity ; and for a
 corporate body of men of science, inheritors of the hard-won tradition of free and

 fearless inquiry into the facts of nature untrammelled by prejudice, for any such
 body to decline to receive evidence laboriously attained and discreetly and in-

 offensively presented by observers of accepted competency in other branches,
 would be, if ever actually done and persisted in, a terrible throwing away of their
 prerogative, and an imitation of the errors of a school of thought against which
 the struggle was at one time severe.

      In the early days of the Coperuican theory, Galileo for some years refrained from
 teaching it, though fully believing its truth, because he considered that he had
                                                                                                  TBANSACTI05S OF SECTION A.                           553

better get more fully settled iu his recent University chair before eToking the storm

of academic controversy which the ahaodoDmeut of the Ptolemaic system would

arouse. The same thing literally is going on to-day. I know of men who hesitate

--to avow interest in these new investigations (I do not mean credence the time is

too earlj' for avowing credence in any but the most rudimentary and definitely

--ascertained facts but hesitate to avow interest) until they have settled dowu

more securely and made a name for themselves in other lines. Caution and slow

progress are extremely necessary ; fear of avowing interest or of examining into

unorthodox facts is, I venture to say, not in accordance with the highest traditions

of the scientific attitude.

We are, I suppose, to some extent afraid of each other, but we are still more

Weafraid of ourselves.                                                                            have great respect for the opinions of our elders and

Wesuperiors; we hud the matter distasteful to them, so we are silent.                                                                                  have,

moreover, a righteous mistrust of our own powers and knowledge ; we perceive

that it is a wide region extending into several already cultivated branches of

science, that a many-sided and highly-trained mind is necessary adequately to cope

with all its ramifications, that in the absence of strict inquiry imposture has been

rampant in some portions of it for centuries, and that unless we are preternaturally
careful we may get led into quagmires if we venture on it at all.

    Now let me be more definite, and try to state what this field is, the explora-

tion of which is regarded as so dangerous. I might call it the borderland

of physics and psychology. I might call it the connection between life and

energy; or the connection between mind and matter. It is an intermediate region,

bounded on the north by psychology, on the south by physics, on the east by phy-

siology, and on the west by pathology and medicine. An occasional psychologist has
groped down into it and become a metaphysician. An occasional physicist has

wandered up into it and lost his base, to the horror of his quondam brethren.

ABiologists mostly look at it askance, or deny its existence.                                                                            few medical practi-

tioners, after long maintenance of a similar attitude, have begun to annex a portion

of its western frontier. The whole region seems to be inhabited mainly by savages,

many of them, so far as we can judge from a distance, given to gross superstition.

It ma}', for all I know, have been hastily traversed and rudely surveyed by a few

clear-eyed travellers                                                                             but their legends concerning it are not very credible, certainly
                                                                                               ;

are not believed.

Why not leave it to the metaphysicians F I say it has been left to them long

enough. They have explored it usually with insufficient equipment. The physical

knowledge of the great philosophers has been necessarily scanty ; and though the

ideas which we owe to their genius may ultimately be of the greatest service

to us as physicists, still their methods are not our methods. They may be said to

have floated a balloon over the region with a looking-glass attached, in which
they have caught queer and fragmentary glimpses. They may have seen more

than we give them credit for, but they appear to have guessed far more than they

saw.

     Our method is different. "VVe prefer to creep slowly from our base of physical
knowledge, to engineer carefully as we go, establishing forts, making roads, and

thoroughly exploring the country ; making a progress very slow, but very lasting.
The psychologists from their side may meet us. I hope they will ; but one or

other of us ought tO begin.

   A vulnerable spot on our side seems to be the connection between life and

energy. The conservation of energy has been so long established as to have become

a commonplace. The relation of life to energy is not imderstood. Life is not

energy, and the death of an animal affects the amount of energy no whit yet a
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

totality of tilings, by which ereryone must admit that actions are S'liided, mav not

include the future as well as the past, and that to attempt to deduce those actions from

the past only -will prove impossible.' In some way matter can be moved, guided,

disturbed, by the agency of living beings ; in some way there is a control, a

directing-agency active, and events are caused at its choice and will that would

not otherwise happen.

   A luminous and helpful idea is that time is but a relative mode of regarding

things ; we progress through phenomena at a certain definite pace, and this sub-

jective advance we interpret in an objective manner, as if events necessarily happened
in this order and at this precise rate. But that may be only our mode of regarding
them. The events may be in some sense existent always, both past and future,
and it may be we who are arriving at them, not they which are happening. The

analogy of a traveller in a railway train is useful. If he could never leave the

train nor alter its pace, he would probably consider the landscapes as necessarily

successive, and be unable to conceive their co-existence.

WeThe analogy of a solid cut into sections is closer.                                                     recognise the universe

in sections, and each section we call the present. It is like the string of slices cut
by a microtome ; it is our way of studying the whole. But we may err in sup-

posing that the body only exists in the slices which pass before our microscope in

regular order and succession.

   We perceive, therefore, a possible fourth-dimensional aspect about time, the

inexorableness of whose flow may be a natural part of our present limitations. And

if once we grasp the idea that past and future may be actuallj' existing, we can

recognise that they may have a controlling influence on all present action, and the
two together may constitute ' the higher plane,' or the totality of things, after which,
as it seems to me, we are impelled to seek, in connection with the directing of force

or determinism, and the action of living beings consciously directed to a definite and

preconceived end.

     Inanimate matter is controlled by the vis a tergo ; it is operated on solely by the
past.'- Given certain conditions, and the eil'ect in due time follows. Attempts have

been made to apply the same principle to living and conscious beings, but without

much success. These seem to work for an object, even if it be the mere seeking

for food ; they are controlled by the idea of something not yet palpable. Given

certain conditions, and their action cannot certainly be predicted ; they have a sense

-- --of option and free will. Either their actions are really arbitrary and indeterminate
   which is highly improbable or they are controlled by the future as well as bv

the past. Imagine beings thus controlled : automata you may still call them, but

they will be living automata, and will exhibit all the characteristics of live creatures.

Moreover, if they have a merely experiential Imowledge, necessarily limited by
memory and bounded by the past, they will be unable to predict each other's actions

with any certainty, because the whole of the data are not before them. May not a

clearer apprehension of the meaning of life and will and determinism be gradually

reached in some such direction as this F

    By what means is force exerted, and what, definitely, is force or stress ? I can
hardly put the question here and now so as to be intelligible, except to those who

have  approached and thought over the same  difficulties                                                  but I venture to say that
                                                                                                       ;

there is here something not provided for in the orthodox scheme of physics ; that

modern physics is not complete, and that a line of possible advance lies in this

direction.

    I might go further. Given that force can be exerted by an act of will, do we
understand the mechanism by which this is done ? And if there is a gap in our

knowledge between the conscious idea of a motion and the liberation of muscular

energy needed to accomplish it, how do we know that a body may not be moved

     ' The expression ' controlled by the future ' I first heard in a conversation with
G. F. Fitzgerald, who seemed to consider it applicable to all events, without

exception.

    ^ This is, of course, not assertion, but suggestion. It may be erroneous to draw
any such distinction between animate and inanimate.

·without ordinary material contact by an act of will ? I have no evidence that

such a thing is possible. I have tried once or twice to observe its asserted occur-

rence, and failed to get anything that satisfied me. Others may have been

more fortunate. In any case, I hold that we require more hnowledge before we can
deny the possibility. If the conservation of energy were upset by the process, we

should have grounds for denying it ; but nothing that we know is upset by the

discovery of a novel mode of communicating energy, perhaps some more immediate

action through the ether.  It  is  no  use  theorising                                                  it  is  unwise  to  decline to

know the imiverse very thoroughly and completely before we take up that attitude.
    Again, it is familiar that a thought may be excited in the brain of another

person, transferred thither from our brain, by pulling a suitable trigger ; by liber-

ating energy in the form of sound, for instance, or by the mechanical act of

Awriting, or in other ways.    pre-arranged code called language, and a material

medium of communication, are the recognised methods. May there not also be

an immaterial (perhaps an ethereal) medium of comniuuication P Is it possible

that an idea can be transferred from one person to another by a process such as we

have not yet gi-own accustomed to, and know practically nothing about ? In this

case I have evidence. I assert that I have seen it done ; and am perfectly con-

Whyvinced of the fact. Many others are satisfied of the truth of it too.                                                    must

we speak of it with bated breath, as of a thing of which we are ashamed ? What

right have we to be ashamed of a truth ?
    And after all, when we have grown accustomed to it, it will not seem alto-

gether strange. It is, perhaps, a natural consequence of the community of life or

family relationship running through all living beings. The transmission of life

maybe likened in some ways to the transmission of magnetism, and all magnets

are sympathetically connected, so that if suitably suspended a vibration from one

disturbs others, even though they be distant ninety-two million miles.

It is sometimes objected that, granting thought-transference or telepathy to be

a fact, it belongs more especially to lower forms of life, and that as the cerebral

hemispheres develop we become independent of it ; that what we notice is the

relic of a decaying faculty, not the germ of a new and fruitful sense ; and that
progress is not to be made by studying or attending to it. It may be that it is an

immature mode of communication, adapted to lower stages of consciousness than

ours, but how much can we not learn by studying immature stages ? As well might

the objection be urged against a study of embryology. It may, on the other hand,

as W. F. Barrett has suggested, be an indication of a higher mode of communication,

which shall survive our temporary connection with ordinary matter.

I have spoken of the apparently direct action of mind on mind, and of a possible

action of mind on matter. But the whole region is unexplored territory, and it is

ponceiA'able that matter may react on mind in a way we can at present only dimly

imagine. In fact, the barrier between the two may gradually melt away, as so

many other barriers have done, and we may end in a wider perception of the

unity of nature, such as philosophers have already dreamt of.

I care not what the end may be. I do care that the inquiry shall be

conducted by us, and that we shall be free from the disgrace of jogging along

accustomed roads, leaving to isolated labourers the work, the ridicule, and the

gi'atification, of unfolding a new region to unwilling eyes.

    It may be held that such investigations are not physical and do not concern us.

We cannot tell without trying; and as the results are physical, or at least have

a physical side, it seems reasonable to assume that the process by which they are

produced is a proper subject for physical inquiry. I believe that there is something

in this region which does concern us as physicists. It may concern other sciences

too. It must indeed concern biology ; but with that I have nothing to do.
Biologists have their region, we have ours, and there is no need for us to hang back

from an investigation because they do. Our own science, of Physics or Natural

Philosophy in its widest sense, is the King of the Sciences, and it is for us to lead,

not to follow.

And I say, Lave faith in the Intelligibility of the universe. Intelligibility has
--556 EEPOUT 1891.

been the great creed in the strength of which all intellectual advance has been

attempted, and all scientific progress made.
AAt first things always look mysterious.
                                              comet, lightning, the aurora, the
--rainbow aU strange anomalous mysterious apparitions. But scrutinised in the

dry light of science, their relationship with other better-known things becomes
apparent. They cease to be anomalous ; and though a certain mystery necessarily

remains, it is no more a property peculiar to them, it is shared by the commonest

objects of daily life.

The operations of a chemist, again, if conducted in a haphazard manner, would

be an indescribable medley of effervescences, precipitations, changes in colour and

in substance ; but, guided by a thread of theory running through them, the pro-

cesses fall into a series, they all become fairly intelligible, and any explosion or
catastrophe that may occur is capable of explanation too.

    Now I say that the doctrine of ultimate intelligibility should be pressed into
other departments also. At present we hang back from whole regions of inquiry

aud say they are not for us. A. few we are beginning to grapple with. The

nature of disease is yielding to scrutiny with fruitful result : the mental aberrations

and abnormalities of hypnotism, duplex personality, and allied phenomena, are now
at last being taken under the wing of science alter long ridicule and contempt. The
phenomena of crime, the scientific meaning and justification of altruism, and

other matters relating to life and conduct, are beginning, or perhaps are barely yet

beginning, to show a vulnerable front over which the forces of science may pour.
    Facts so strange that they have often been called miraculous are now no longer

regarded as entirely incredible. All occurrences seem reasonable when contemplated

from the right point of view, and some are believed in which in their essence are still

quite marvellous. Apply warmth for a given period to a sparrow's egg, and what

result could be more incredible or magical if now discovered for the first time.

WhyThe possibilities of the universe are as infinite as is its phj'sical extent.                                                                                                                                       should

we grope with our eyes always downward, and deny the possibility of everything

out of our accustomed beat ?

half-knowledge ; by the time we can grasp something more approximating to the

totality of things the paradoxicality of paradoxes drops away and becomes unrecog-
nisable. I seem to myself to catch glimpses of clues to many of these old questions,
and I urge that we should trust consciousness, which has led us thus far ; should
shrink from no problem when the time seems ripe for an attack upon it, and should

not hesitate to press investigation, and seek to ascertain the laws of even the most

recondite problems of life and mind.

    What we know is as nothing to that which remains to be known. This is
sometimes said as a truism ; sometimes it is half doubted. To me it seems the most
literal truth, and that if we narrow our view to already half-conquered territory only,
we shall be false to the men who won our freedom, and treasonable to the highest

claims of science.

    If I were asked (as I am not) to suggest any practical proposal for immediate

action in the direction indicated, I should not urge anything at all revolutionary.

I do not think that the time is ripe for the Royal Society, for instance, to move in
the matter ; the early stages of such an investigation, in which the human element
is so obtrusive and perturbing, may very properly be left to a societj' devoted to

that special end ; and, thanks to the single-hearted, persistent, aud admirably judi-
cious labours of a few workers, whose names I need not mention because they are

so well known, such a society exists. I do, however, think that whenever in the

view of the leaders of that society the time may have come to put the scientific

--world in official possession of their more securely ascertained facts for instance,
--by presenting a report to this or some other section they ought not to ask in vain

for some recognition of the work accomplished by them. It seems to me desirable

that the work in which they have been so long engaged should be established

on a more permanent basis, such a basis as scientific recognition would be likely
to bestow, so that the existence of the society may not be imperilled by the mor-

tality of individuals.  I  will  not press the suggestion further                                                                                                                                                  it  may bear  fruit

which I have apparently wandered rather far afield, further than is customary
perhaps further than is desirable.

     But I hold that occasionally a wide outlook is wholesome, and that without
such occasional survey, the rigid attention to detail and minute scrutiny of every
little fact, which are so entirely admirable and are so rightly here fostered, are apt
to become unhealthily dull and monotonous. Our life-work is concerned with the
rigid framework of facts, the skeleton or outline map of the universe and, though it

is well for us occasionally to remember that the texture and colour and beauty which
we habitually ignore are not therefore in the slightest degree non-existent, yet it is
safest speedily to return to our base and continue the slow and laborious march with
which we are familiar and which experience has justified. It is because I imagine
that such sj'stematic advance is now beginning to be possible in a fresh and unex-

pected direction that I have attempted to direct your attention to a subject which.

if my prognostications are correct, may turn out to be one of special and peculiar

interest to humanity.

        3. Oil the Ahsorption of Heat in the Solar Atmosphere.

                 By W. E. Wilson, M.R.I.A., F.R.A.8.

The author endeavours to determine with accuracy the ratio of the heat

received from the limb and the centre of the solar disc, and thus, by taking yearly

observations through a sun-spot cycle, to find out if the solar atmosphere varies in

depth.

The apparatus consists of a heliostat which throws a small pencil of sunlight

into a dark room. It is received on a 4-inch concave silver-on-glass mirror of

Aabout 10 feet focus.  small convex mirror is placed inside the focus of the

concave mirror, and thus forms an image of the sun of 80 centimetres in diameter.

This image is allowed to fall on a radio-micrometer of Prof. C. E. Boys. The tube

of the instrument is stopped down to nearly 1 mm. in diameter, so that only about

         slice of limelight is allowed to fall on the mirror of the radio-micrometer,

and is reflected from it on to a horizontal slit in the side of a box which contains

a photographic plate. This plate duiing an observation is allowed to fall with a

uniform rate by a piece of clockwork. Any motion of the mirror of the radio-

micrometer thus records itself on the plate in a curved line.

The clock of the heliostat is stopped and the image of the sun is allowed to

transit across the mouth of the radio-micrometer, and the curve giving the values

of the heat received from the solar disc is recorded on the photographic plate.

   A seconds pendulum swings across the track of the limelight, so that the

photographed curve is notched into seconds of time, and a means thus given of

localising the position of the instrument on the solar disc.

of small gyrostats, having the undisturbed positions of their axes in the commoo

direction of the magnetic force and the propagation of tlie beam, and all vibrating

in the same sense. When in consequence of the vibrating motion each gyrostat

has its axis of rotation displaced from this direction, it reacts on the surrounding
medium with transverse force at right angles to the plane through the axis of
rotation and the direction of motion.

     By compounding this stress with the elastic forces of displacement of the ether,
differential equations of motion are obtained which are of precisely the form neces-
sary to account for the diS'erenoe in rate of propagation of the two circularly

polarised rays constituting the plane polarised ray.
     It is obviously suggested by the gyrostatic investigation that it ought to be

possible to explain the magneto-optic rotation on the electromagnetic theory of
light as a consequence of the existence of the small magnets which are supposed

imbedded in the medium with their axes in the direction of propagation of the ray,
and therefore producing the magnetisation which the medium has in that

direction.

      In consequence of the motions of the ether, the direction of the chains of
magnetised molecules which are supposed to exist along the direction of magnetisa-

tion (here taken as axis of s) in the undisturbed state of the medium is continually
undergoing change at every point, and thus the direction of the axial magnetic

force along each chain also undergoes alteration. It is obvious that if the dis-
placements be everywhere small, the actual magnitude of this force will sustain
only a very small percentage of alteration, but that each small change of direction
will produce a component magnetic force in each of the two directions at right
angles to the axis. The calling into existence of these components will produce
corresponding electromotive forces tending to increase the displacements.

     The electromotive force in the direction of y is given by

                                 Q = _dG_d±

                                                             (It dy

where dG\dt stands for the total time rate of change of G, the component of vector

any part of the total time-rate of variation of --dG\dz will denote the space-rate of

variation in the direction of z of an electromotive force parallel to y, provided the
time and space differentiations of the part are commutative.

    Now if the displacement of the ether j^articles from the undisturbed positions

be take7i as parallel and proportional to the electric displacement, and be the
component of magnetisation of the substance in the direction of s due to the exis-

/tence of the molecular magnets, then considering the electric displacement in the

direction of .r, we see that the component magnetic force in the direction of x is

eCdfldz, and thus the magnetic induction through unit of area in the plane of yz is
fieCdfldz, where e is a coefficient of proportionality. The time-rate of variation of

this is

                                           By J. Larmor.

     In an electrical vibrator of rapid period the currents in the metallic parts are
confined to the surface ; the periodic times are therefore independent of the metals

     ' It ought to be stated that I understand from a reference In M. Poincare's ' The-
ories de Maxwell' that a similar theory has been proposed by M. Potier in a note to

of which the vibrators are made, being determined only by their forms, and there
is no considerable loss due to degradation into heat in these conductors. The
question occurs, what are the surface conditions that must be imposed under these

circumstances at the boundaries of the dielectric, in order that the vibrations may

be discussed with reference only to the dielectric in which they exist and are
propagated P

     It appears that the vibrations are analogous to those of an elastic solid, when
elastic displacement is made the analogue of the electric displacement in the dielec-

tric. It is demonstrable ' that if the velocity of propagation is the inverse square
root of the specific inductive capacity, this auxiliary solid must be considered as
incompressible, and the scheme of electrodynamics must be that of Maxwell. The
surface condition will then be absolute stiffness in the surface layer for all tano-en-

tial displacement, and freedom for normal displacement.

    The mathematical examination of a typical case shows that this way of pre-
senting the phenomena is practically exact for all wave-lengths greater than a cen-

timetre for copper or other good conducting metal. For very minute waves the
circumstances are not independent of the material of the conductor, but are similar
to those which actually exist in the case of the metallic reflexion of light-waves.

    By aid of this representation a qualitative view of the possible modes of vibra-

tion IS rendered feasible in cases where the mathematical analysis would beditficult

or impossible. '-^

5. On the Measurement of Stationary Hertzian Oscillations along Wires,
  and the Damping of Electric Waves. By Professor D. E. Jones, B.Sc.

    An account was given of preliminary experiments made in Bonn (at the

suggestion of Professor Hertz) on electric waves in wires. The first object was to
find a smiple method of measuring the disturbance at different points of a wire (or
pair of wires) along which are sent waves which interfere after reflection at the
ends. It was found that satisfactory measurements could be made by inserting a
very small thermo-j unction in the circuit at diflerent points, and noting the deflec-
tion of a low-resistance galvanometer connected up to it. The method is delicate
enough to detect and measure exceedingly small currents, such as those produced
by telephones.

     The method was applied to measure disturbances along a pair of parallel wires
about 8 cm. apart and each about 130 metres in length. One end of each wire was
connected to a (secondary) metallic plate 40 cm. in diameter. In the first set of
experiments the other (far) ends of the wires were left free. The vibrator was of
the usual type, provided with plates of the same size as those on the near ends of
the wires and facing them. The wave-length of the disturbance along the wires
was about 4-3 metres. On plotting curves with distances from the (far) ends of
the wires as abscissae and galvanometer deflections as ordinates the following
results were obtained :

                 yr

at any point. At about 4'6 m. there was a minimum deflection of 11, at 6-7 m. a
maximum of 46, at 9 m. a minimum of 13, at 11 m. a maximum of 23, and so on.
Tlius the waves tail oft' rapidly. There are two complete strongly-marked wares
and indications of a third, after which the disturbance tends to become steady along

the wire.

     IT. AVhen the far ends of the wires were joined together similar results were
obtained, excepting that the positions of maxima and minima were interchanged,

the disturbance, e.f/., being a maximum at the ends. The results indicate that only
a small number of waves are sent out by the primary vibrator, and that these are

rapidly damped. In both the above sets of experiments the primary and secondary
plates were 30 cm. apart.

    III. (Ends joined). On bringing the .secondary and primary plates nearer
together the damping became more and more rapid, as if the secondary more

quickly absorbed the energy radiated out by the primary. When the plates were

5 cm. apart only one wave could be detected.
     The curves (I, II, III) given above were measured on different days and under

different circumstances. They cease where the errors of observation become com-
parable with the variations to be measured. The author's method has the advantage
of reqiuriug only the simplest apparatus. The only other published method which
has been used for such measurements is Dr. Rubens' bolometric method, but Mr.
Bjerknes has obtained similar results to those of the author with an electrometer

instead of a thermo-junction.
     lu order to find whether the junction produced any disturbance, loops of wire

of varying lengths were inserted at 17 m. from the far end ; but loops up to 1 m.
long did not appear seriously to affect the positions of the maxima and minima.

          6. On the Froimgation of Electromagnetic Waves in Wires.
                                     By Walter Thoep.

     The following is an account of some experiments made in the physical labora-
tory at Trinity College, Dublin, with apparatus kindly placed at the author's dis-
posal by Professor Fitzgerald.

     The experiments are incomplete, inasmuch as Mr. Trouton's value (0'68 metre)
of the wave-length in air is assumed for the resonating circle which the author
used. The author's determinations of this wave-length agree with Mr. Trouton's,
but thev were few in number, and made at the very commencement of the work.

      These experiments were undertaken with the hope of throwing some light upon

the results previously obtained by Professor Hertz.' He found the ratio of the

 velocity of propagation of electromagnetic waves in air to the velocity in copper
wires to be as 75 : 47, or VQ. His wave-length in air was 7'5 metres.

     Using much shorter waves (0 68m.) and wires of different diameters, the author
 obtained a ratio varying from 1 77 for very fine wires to very near unity for thick

 wires.

      The apparatus has been fully described by Mr. Trouton.* The wire used was
 soldered atone end to a piece of iron plate (9 x 4cm. and O'Scm. thick), which was
 attached by means of silken cord to the vertical wooden support of the oscillators,
 the plate being fixed opposite one of the cylindrical oscillators. The wire was sup-
 ported hoiizontally along the axis of the parabolic cylinder used to concentrate the

 radiations.

      In the first few experiments the further end of the wire was bent into a very
 small hook, to which a piece of string was attached to keep the wire taut ; but
 this minute hook was found to cause considerable disturbance at the end which
was never a node, and the distance from the end to the first node along the wire
 was always less than the other internodes. The hook was therefore removed, and
 the end of the wire kept straight.

      The resonating circle was 7ucm. diameter, and was held with its plane parallel
 to the wire, and with the spark gap at its greatest distance from the wire.

                                   ' Wiedemann's Annalen, vol. 34, p. 5.51.
                                       ' Nature, vol. 39, p. 391 ; vol. 40, p. 398.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                                               563

     The method of experiment was to adjust the gilt kuohs of the oscillatois about

5mm. apart, and, starting- from the most distant end of the wire, piclc out nodes by

careful adjustment of the length of the spark gap in the resonating circle. Two

internodal distances were usuall}' measured, but sometimes three or four.

     The lengths of the internodal distances were found to agree well for the same
wire and receiver. The mean of thirteen measurements with a wire 4'9 metres
long and l'57mm. diameter gave a wave-length of 0-605 metre. Five experimentd
with a wire 4 metres long and 2-9mm. diameter showed the wave-length 0-05 metre.

A brass gas-pipe was next tried. This was 3-G metres long and 11mm. diameter

and gave a wave-length of 0*62 metre, as a mean of fourteen experiments.

   A thin wire, 5 metres long andO'36mm. diameter, gave a wa\e-length of 0-476

metre (mean often experiments).

   A very fine wire, 4 metres long and 078mm. diameter, gave as a mean of

twelve experiments a wave-length of 0-384 metre.

     The author thinks that these experiments show that Professor Hertz's residts

were due to the comparative thinness of the wire he used as judged by the length

of his waves.

7. On Reflection near the Polarising Angle from the Clean Surfaces of
                       Liquids. By Lord Eayleigh, Sec.B.S.

If the image of the sun, reflected at the polarising angle from the surface of

ordinary water, be examined through a good nicol, no complete extinction can be

observed. At most a dark nebulous patch is seen upon the face of the sun. If,

however, the surface of the water be i'ree from contamination, a well-detined band

crosses the solar disc, coloured above and below, and to all appearance black, or

nearlj' so, at its centre. The width of this band may be estimated at about one-
Afifth of the solar diameter.
                               trace of olive-oil, decidedly short of what is

required to stop the camphor movements, practically obliterates the band. The

colour seen from clean water, which is due to the variation of the polarising

angle with wave-length, may be compensated by holding a 20° water prism

between the eye and the nicol. The band is thus achromatised, but colour is of

course introduced at the upper and lower limbs of the sun.

The deterioration of the band by contamination is not measured by the decre-

Ament of surface tension.  strong solution of oleate of soda or a saturated solution

of camphor may give a much better band than distilled water with a somewhat

greasy lace. Moreover, difl'erent parts of the same surface (over which the tension

is constant) are often observed to produce very different effects.

Preci.'e measures of the ellipticity abundantly confirm these preliminary

results. Sunlight passing through a round hole fitted with cross-wires falls upon a

collimatiug lens, thence after reflection from an adjustable mirror traverses the

polarising nicol, and after reflection from the horizontal liquid surface passes a

quarter-wave mica and an analj-sing nicol. The latter is set alternately to a

deviation of ± 30° from the plane of incidence, and the azimuth of the polariser

required to bring the dark spot upon the cross- wires in each case is recorded.

If 2a be the diflerence of readintrs, tan 30° tan a, denoted by k, represents the

ellipticity, measuring as it does the ratio of reflection of amplitudes of the two

k=--])rincipal components. Jamiu found for water  -00577, and for alcohol

=/c + -00208.

    In my apparatus, which worked remarkably well, a change of setting of the

polariser of about two minutes was directly apparent when the analyser stood at

± 30°, and very early experiments showed that the ellipticity of clean water could

barely be measured. While in the ordinary water 2a might lie between ^°and 1^°,

the value for clean water seemed not to exceed 2'. Usually no error could be

perceived by mere inspection when the analyser was put over from + 30° to --30°;

and the meiin of long series of alternations gave a diflerence sometimes in one

direction and sometimes in tlie opposite. These discrepancies could only be

attributed to real changes in the purity of the surfaces, and evidence gradually

accumulated that the value for a clean surface was not zero, as had been expected,

                                                                    oo2

but about 2', and that in the direction opposite to what is found for an ordinary

surface. This 2' can hardly be other than real, for it has been recovered several

times after complete resetting of all the apparatus.

WeIn any case the ellipticity here presenting itself is exceedingly small.  have

/c= + tan 30° tan 1'= + -00017.

The intensity of the light reflected from water at the polarising angle, measured by

but, on the other hand, I was unable to apply these metJiods so completely. The

value obtained was
                                              K= + -00085.

A strong brine, cleansed like the water, gave

                                             K= --00042.

About the same value applies to a saturated solution of camphor, while fur oleate
of soda the value was --002. For petroleum again k= + -0010.

      It is impossible to feel confidence that these small values really express pro-

perties of the liquids whose names are attached to them. What is certain is that,
in a large number of cases, the ellipticity is very much less than has hitherto been
supposed, and it is not improbable that even the residual ellipticity may be due

to contamination, or, if not to contamination properly so-called, to iusuthcient

abruptness in the transition from the one medium to the other.

                 3. Electrolytic Problems. By Robert L. Mond.

     The author establishes the complete analogy between electric conduction
through electrolytes and what may be called metallic conduction.

    He assumes with Wiedemann that the better conducting molecules in the

electrolyte form chains, while the worse conducting molecules lorm dielectric tubes
surrounding them. According to Clerk Maxwells theory, electric energy is trans-
mitted through the dielectric along conductors. The author assumes that this
transmission is accompanied by molecular dissociation in the dielectric tubes sur-
rounding each electrolytic chain. A\'ith these assumptions he explains the chief
electrical and chemical effects produced during electrolysis.

     The author gives an account of experiments he has made to test the validity of
the above views.

                                   By A. P. Chattock.

     The author measures the streugth of the electrostatic field at the surface of a
needle point by the mechanical force exerted by the field upon the needle parallel
to its axis ; and justifies experimentally the formula

                                                                                                                                                                                             r

where /is the field strength at a point of radius of curvature r, and P the mecha-

nical pull upon it.

Values of/ at the instant of discharge in air are given for air pressures, varying

from 10 cm. to 76 cm. of mercury                                                                                                                                                             the measurements havino- been made on needle

/xshown that for radii less than about 10"'^ cm. the product                                                                                                                                                    ;-»'8 is fairly constant

its value at 76 cm. mercury pressure being 16'5.

     In the light of these results the possible ways are discussed in which resistance
to discharge may arise at a point. The conclusion is arrived at that the resistance

at a clean point is due to the formation of Grotthuss chains of the air molecules

surrounding the point ; and it is shown that, on this view, the charges carried by

the gas atoms are probably of the same order of magnitude as those carried by the

same atoms in electrolytes.

The variations of/ with air pressure are then referred to, and are shown to be

in accordance with the Grotthuss chain hypothesis so far as they go.

     7. On the Measurement of Liquid Resistances.'^ Py J. Svvinbubne.

    To avoid errors due to variations of resistance or polarisation at the electrodes,
the fall of potential over a portion of the electrolyte is measured. Siphon tubes
are arranged to connect the feeling points with vessels containing non-polarisable
electrodes in a suitable electrolyte. Various ways of arranging the apparatus are

described.

8. The Surface-Tension of Ether and Alcohol at Different Temperatures.

                By Professor William Ramsay, Ph.D., F.B.8.

Measurements of the ascent of these liquids in a calibrated capillary tube were

made at temperatures varying from that of the atmosphere to within a short

distance of the critical point. These measurements, combined with determinations

of the angle of contact of the meniscus of the liquid with the walls of a containing

narrow-bore tube, and also with a knowledge of the densities of the liquid and the

vapour, give data for calculating the surface-tension. The results go to prove

that surface-tension is not a linear function of temperature. It is apparently

related to the heat of the vaporisation of the liquid in a somewhat simple manner.

The angle of contact of the liquid with the tube walls varies in a remarkable

manner with the temperature. While, at temperatm-es for ether up to 160°, the angle

of contact is a small and a gradually decreasing quantity, at that temperature it is

zero : with rise of temperature above 160°, the angle of contact increases slowly at

first, rapidly as the temperature approaches the critical, until at the critical point it

is a right angle. It is remarkable that above 160° no bubble will stick in the tube,

but ascends to the top                                                                                      whereas below that                                                                  temperature  a  babble will  remain in

cular, tlie edges of the lens being just iu contact with the sides of the tube when
it commences to ascend. There appears, therefore, to be a special temperature for
each liquid, at which the angle of contact of its meniscus with the walls of the
containing vessel is zero.

           4, On a Geometrical Ilhi.itration of a Dynamical Theorem.
                             By Sir Robert Ball, F.E.S.

     It was observed in this paper that a dynamical system Avheu moving in any
way could be constrained to adhere to the same mo'tion, so that every element
fihould continue to twist about the same screw as it was twisting: about at the
moment. The forces to be applied for this purpose could be simply expressed, and a
geometrical construction was given in the particular case of a rigid body, which
was possessed of three degrees of freedom. It was shown that the screws about
which a body so restricted could twist might be represented by points in a plane
made on two ellipses, one representing the screws about which the body could
twist with zero kinetic energy, the other representing the screws of zero pit'ch. It
was then shown that two homographic systems of points could be constructed such

that if any point P be joined to its correspondent Q, tlien the hole of the ray with

regard to the pitch ellipse represents the screw on which a wrench could be placed
which should just steady the motion. The pole of the same ray with regard to the
knaetic ellipse gives the acceleration of the body if permitted to pursue its move-

ment without interference. A complete account of the investigation will shortly

appear in the publications of the Royal Irish Academy.

                  6. 071 the Transformation of a Differential Resolvent.

                    By the Rev. Robert Harley, M.A., F.B.S.

     If there be two algebraic equations such that they can be changed, the one into
the other, by assuming, without loss of generality, certain relations among their
variables; and if the differential resolvent of one of these equations is known, how can
we pass directly to the differential resolvent of the other, without having recourse
to a separate and independent calculation ? That is the question I propose to
consider in the present paper. Nearly thirty years ago, when seeking to determine
the form of the differential resolvents of two trinomial algebraic equations connected
in the manner above described, I endeavoured to effect a passage from one differ-
ential resolvent to another by a simple transformation, but was stopped by what

seemed to me at the time to be an anomalous result. Fortunately the result was

placed upon record for future discussion ; it will be found in Art. 13 of a paper read
before the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester (November 4, 1862),

given the differential resolvent of (a) to find that of (/3). The following method

is effective.

    If in equation (a) we write

which is of the same form as (/3). Here

                      D-=.r 'L (,i' + Y)x'--, or = - («' + 1)D'.

These substitutions being made in the resolvent (a') we are led to                . (y')

which contains the common factor (D -- 1), and therefore admits of a first integra-
tion, Operating with (D -- 1)"^ , and determining the constant by summing for

the (n+1) roots of i/'{2y' = n' +1), we obtain the differential resolvent of (y),

namely,

6. On the Transformations used in connection with the duality of Differen-

expressions

                          x = p',y = q',z=p'3:' + q'y'-z\

required is to express the derivatives of j), q with regard to p', q' in terms of those

NowpQ'i , q' with regard to ;>, q.        a theory of the reversion of partial derivatives

of two variables with regard to two others by interchange of the dependent and

independent pairs has been developed.

The analogous but simpler reciprocal transformation of ordinary differential

expressions

                                    x'=p,y'=px-y

or

                                             x=p',y=p'x'-y'

amounts only to the interchange of dependent and independent variables in deriva-
tives oi p with regard to^j'; and a quite complete theory of such a reversion is at
our disposal. One consequence is that any reciprocant gives us on replacing

~, ....by-/-, --^.., . . ,                a self-reciprocal expression, i.e.. the criterion of

      9. The Geometry of Confocal Conies. By Professor T. C. Lewis.
    1. If PP', QQ' be chords of contact of T in two confocal conies, then a conic
can be described with Q, Q' as foci which shall touch the conic PP' at P and P'.

                                    Fig. 1.

    2. By taking T on the outer of the two ellipses, it follows that the ellipse with
foci at Q, Q' which passes through T will have contact of the third order with the
confocal through T ; and the hyperbola with foci at Q, Q,' which passes through T

Hwill have contact of the third order with the hyperbola whose foci are S and

which passes through T.
     3. In fig. 3 PQ, PQ', P'Q, P'Q' are all tangents to one ellipse confocal with

that through Q, Q'. Let this be q^ q,, q^ q^ (fig. 3). The four tangents to an ellipse
intersect in three pairs of points. If each of one pair is on a confocal conic, so also
is each of the others. Q, Q' lie on one confocal ; T, T' lie on another confocal.

     4. As in 1, a conic with P, P' as foci can be drawn touching the confocal TT'

at T and T' .-. PT-TP' = PT'-TT'.

                       .'. a circle can be inscribed in the quadrilateral TPT'P'.

5. As a particular case, when P and Q coincide the two tangents from T meet

Lthe tangent at in Q, Q' (fig. 4) which are on a confocal, and the circle inscribed

in TQQ' touches the ellipse at L.

QPP' be consecutive points                                                                                                  being the intersection of consecutive tangents lies on

to stretch to P is equal to the one which must be placed round it to stretch to P'.

and keeping them stretched by a pencil point.
     And, similarly if an endless string be placed round an ellipse whose circum-

ference is shorter than the string, and if the point 51' be fixed, and a loop of the

string be passed through a small ring at L and pulled tight, then if a pencil be put

through the ring and moved steadily away from the ellipse, a confocal hyperbola

will be described (fig. 5).

Various other cases arise.

Also the tangents from T to the circle inscribed in TQQ/ are of constant length.

If the tangent at L meet the confocal ellipse through T in T' and T", the

confocal hyperbblas through T','T" will pass through P, P' respectively and T' T"

-- arc PP' is constant.

Eight equal tangents can be drawn from the outer to the inner of two confocal

ellipses.

    8. If in fig. 5 the tangent be drawn at M, M' or L' to meet the tangent from

QT in and Q', then the point of contact of this tangent will be the point at

which either an inscribed or an escribed circle of the triangle TQQ' will touch the

ellipse.

     9. If a triangle be drawn with each side touching an ellipse, then an infinite
number of triangles of equal perimeter can be drawn whose sides touch the ellipse
their three angular points lying one on each of three confocal ellipses.

     10. If the "three* confocals which are the loci of the angular points coincide, the
triangles are inscribed in one and circumscribed about another of two confocal

ellipses.

    In this case their perimeter is a maximum for all triangles inscribed in the
outer ellipse, and a minimum for all triangles circumscribing the inner ellipse.

     11. So for a polygon of any number of sides.
     Also each tangent is divided into two sections at the point of contact. If the
polygon has n sides there are 2?i. sections; starting with anyone of them and

magnitude to those already passed, occurring in the same order. The sections of the
sides of the triangle in fig. 6 with the same number attached are equal to one another.

12. On the Importance of the Conception of Direction in Natural Philo-
                                 sophy. By E. T. Dixon.

     This importance has already been recognised in the higher branches of science
in the guise of Vector theories, and the chief reason it has not been made use of in
elementary geometry is the want of a proper definition. Such proper definition
might be deduced from the conception of direction as a relation between two
positions which is independent of the distance between them and of the absolute
position of either of them in space. The concept thus defined is independent of

the conception of a straight line, and so may be used to define it, and is therefore
distinct from tbe concept defined, by saying that two straight lines which have a
common point have the same or different directions according as they coincide or
not. That some notion of direction is necessary to elementary geometry is shown
by the fact that without it right- and left-handed figures which are equal in every
respect cannot be distinguished; and that the concept as defined is commonly
entertained, is proved by the fact that it follows from Newton's Laws of Motion
that absolutely fixed directions may be conceived in space, although absolutely

fixed positions cannot.'

    The following Reports and Papers were read :

2. Comparison of Eye and Hand Registration of Lines in the Violet and

      Ultra-Violet of the Solar Spectrum, against Photographic Records of
     the same, with the same Instrtimevt, after a lapse of several years.

    By C. PiAZZi Smyth, LL.B., F.R.S.E.

   A comparison of tlie plates seems to lead to such practically useful conclusions

as the following :
     1. Ttoo photographic representations are far more trustworthy than three or

probably a much greater number of hand-drawn views of solar-spectrum lines,
even when the eye imagines it sees them very clearly.

     2. The photographic principle records with ease, and the utmost vigour of
black, white and grey of various shades, a world of objects in certain spectral
regions where the eye can see nothing whatever.

    3. What photography depicts in such cases is what the human eye ought to
see, and would see were it divinely perfect simply as an eye.

     4. The ordinary spots, pin-holes and dust-marks, which too often abound in
photography, never assume such shapes as might lead to their being mistaken by
any experienced observer for a single one of Nature's solar-spectrum lines of light

or shade.

     5. The frequent errors, and then ail-pervading effects, fallen into by some
photographers in the way of over or under exposure, and over or under develop-
ment, may prevent the absolute intensity of any one line, on one plate alone, being
usefully quoted as a scientific datum. Bat the relative intensities, and innumerable
distinctions in hue and shape, of thick or thin, dark or light, closely arrayed or
widely scattered, flutings gradating towards the violet or towards the red end,
and regularly or irregularly spaced lines on the same plate, are full of most
important and instructive particulars. While they mostly hold good also, from
plate to plate of the same parts of spectral space, on all the proofs that niay be
taken both day after day, and through a very wide range of all the possibilities of
perversion and misuse which may be humanly committed upon this most exquisite
aid, viz. photography, to the noblest of the senses of man, vision.

     6. In principle, all this has long been known to advanced workers in every
civilised nation. But as it is not everywhere yet utilised to the extent it might
well be, it is hoped that this further and rather multitudinous example, on an
extreme scale too, of spectral separation, and capable of showing such a Titanic
instance of a dark thunder-cloud-looking column as ' Great K,' by pure photo-
graphy only eight months ago, in a solar-spectrum telescopic field which was at the
time absolute emptiness to the eye, may be useful in calling increased attention to
similar and more extensive employments of photography in the future.

      3. Note on Observing the Rotation of the Sun with the Spectroscope.
                   By G. Johnstone Stoney, M.A., D.Sc, F.H.8.

      In this note the author described an arrangement for conspicuously exhibiting
to the eye the rotation of the sun by the spectroscope. The sun's light, after
 reflection from the mirror of a heliostat, is received by a telescope lens which
 forms an image of the sun on the slit of the spectroscope. The lens is attached to
 a vertical board, and two screws are partly screwed side by side into the board
 and at some distance above the lens. The projecting heads of the screws rest on a
--574 REPORT 1891.

fixed support so that the board can oscillate a little sideways. This carries the

image of the sun backwards and forwards over the slit, so that the light admitted

by the slit is alternately taken from a part of the solar disk near the following

limb which is advancing towards the earth, and from a part near the preceding

limb which is receding. Accordingly the solar lines in the spectrum are alternately

--shifted a little perhaps about one-twentieth or one-thirtieth of a tenthet-metre
to the right and left, while the earth-lines maintain their position unaltered. The

eye readily detects this motion even when so small.

     There is a solar line a little less refrangible than the eighth pair of double

lines in the great B oxygen group, which, with the arrangement described above,

is seen to approach and recede from the double line in sympathy with the motion

of the pendulum. Another line well placed for the observation is the earth-line,

which is a very little  more  refrangible than D.,                                                                                            and  another  convenient  group is
                                                                                                                                           ;

where there is a strong iron line on the more refrangible side of D.,, about as far

from Dr, on one side as Dj is on the other. There is an earth-line in nearly the

same position. The two appear as a single line when the light is taken from the

preceding limb of the sun, and as a double line when it is taken from the following

limb ; and with the pendulum arrangement these appearances alternate.

BOf these three the observation on the line can be well made in the second

Dspectrum of a Rowland's grating If inch long. The observations near                                                                                                    are

best made in the fifth spectrum.

There are of course multitudes of other lines on which the observation can be

made.

                    4. On the Cause of Double Lines in Spectra.
                 By G. Johnstone Stonet, M.A., RSc, F.B.S.

     The lines of the specti'um of a gas are due to some events which occur within
the molecules, and which are able to affect the retber. These events may be
Hertzian discharges between molecules that are ditterently electrified, or they may
be the moving about of those irremovable electric charges, the supposition of
which offers the simplest explanation of Faraday's law of electrolysis. The
amount of the charge which is associated with each of the bonds, and of which two
or more seem to be present in every chemical atom, is always the same quantity

of electricity. In a communication made to the British Association in 1874 the

author invited attention to this fixed quantity of electricity as one of thi'ee funda-

mental units presented to us by nature (see ' Phil. Mag.' for May 1881), and

estimated its value, which is about the twentiethet (i.e. 1/10-") of the electro-

magnetic unit of quantity in the ohm series.
     Several considerations (of which perhaps the most decisive is the phenomenon

of the reversal of lines) suggest that the source of the spectral lines is to be

sought not in the Hertzian discharges, but in the carrying about of the fixed

electric charges, which for convenience may be called the electrons. The present

investigation however is not dependent on this or any other particular hypothesis,
since it is with the laws of the events within the molecules that it is concerned,
and the course of the investigation shows that these laws are the laws of the

motion of separate elements of volume, which may be conveniently thought of as

the motion of those parts of the molecule to which the electrons are to be regarded

as indissolubly bound. An electron, if waved about in some particular way by

the motions within the molecule, would occasion such electro-magnetic waves as
are revealed to us by the spectroscope.

    Now the irrotational motion of an element of volume consists in its traversing
Wesome orbit, accompanied perhaps by a simultaneous distortion of its form.
are only concerned with the orbital motion. This motion may be resolved by

Fourier's Theorem into the superposition of partials, each of which is a simple
pendulous motion in an ellipse, and each of these partials produces its own line in
the spectrum. Seven constants are required for the full determination of each

partial if the orbit of the electron is a curve of double curvature, or five if it is a

plain curve. Now the observation of a line supplies only two equations between
          TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                                 575

these. The wave-length of the line, when corrected for the refraction of the air,

jrives The periodic time of the motion of the electron in the corresponding partial,

and the brightness of the line gives a quantity proportional to cr + b', n and b

being the axes of the ellipse.

    But there is one case, and fortunately a case which at all events frequently
occurs, and that perhaps is universal, in which we receive a very interesting

addition to our knowledge ; explaining on the one hand the double lines that are
so frequent in spectra, and on the other telling us the actual forms of the elliptic
partials of the motion going on in the molecules. This important case occurs
whenever some of the forces which determine the motiDn of the electron are
feeble compared with the others, and are such as to produce that familiar form of

perturbation which consists in an apsidal motion of the elliptic partials. When

this perturbation prevails, the lines are rendered double by it, and an examination
of the positions and intensities of the two constituents of a double line enables us

to determine (a) the form of the elliptic partial to which they are due, {b) the
time which the electron takes to travel round it, and (c) both the direction and
speed of the apsidal perturbation. Thus the principal double line of sodium is

found to have its source in a long elliptic partial, the ratio of the axes of which
lies somewhere between 11:1 and 13:1. Round this partial the electron travels

abaut 1,984: times during one revolution of its slow apsidal perturbation, and there

is time for about 36 of these slow apsidal revolutions to take place during each

flight of the molecule. Moreover in this case the apsidal motion takes place in

the same direction as the motion of the electron round the ellipse. An equal

amount of information can be obtained in the case of every other double line that

can be adequately observed.

     The author thought he had reason to suspect from observation that almost all
spectral lines are double, and that they appear single only when our spectroscopes
have insufficient revolving power, or when each of the constituents has so widened

out as to obliterate the interval between them, or in the rare cases when the

partial from which they arise being circular one of the two constituents of the

double line is of cypher intensity.' If this shall turn out to be the case, there

must be some common cause for the apsidal perturbation, and the author ventured

to suggest as the most probable cause the feeble reaction which the fether exerts

on the electron, consequent on the energy which the molecule imparts to the

Aaether when producing the electromagnetic waves.  fuller account of the in-

vestigation is being printed by the Royal Dublin Society in its Scientific Trans-

actions.

line arises from a circular motion. Accordingly they would not suffer further
duplication if an additional apsidal perturbation were introduced.

10. 0)1 the probable Nature of the Bright Strenhs on the Moon.

               By Dr. Ralph Copeland, F.R.A.S., F.R.8.E.

In this paper the author described the chief features of the bright lunar streaks,

especially their invisibility when the shadows of the mountains are most con-

spicuous, and their great prominence when the lunar shadows are imperceptible.

It was explained that the brifiht streaks demanded for their visibility not so

much a high angle of illumination, as a front illumination. In other words, thev

become visible when the light falls more or less closely iu the line of sight.

If this condition is fulfilled the streaks come prominently mto view quite

regardless of the inclination of the surfaces on which they occur. The surfaces

indeed may make almost any angle, either with the line of sight or with the sun's

rays, provided they are at all turned towards the common direction of the spectator

and tlie sun.

    An important deduction from this fundamental fact is that each elementary

portion of the streak surface is of a form that is symmetrical to the spectator from

whatever point it is seen. The sphere alone appears to fulfil this condition ; hence
it may be assumed that the surface of the strealc material must be made up of a

large number of more or less complete spherical surfaces. These minute surfaces

Wemay be either concave or convex.  may therefore regard the streaks as being

produced by a material pitted with minute cavities of s) herical figure, or strewn

over with minute solid spheres. In the latter case it is probable that the material

is more or less transparent, or at least ti-anslucent.

To test this hypotliesis, a plaster model of the moon 22 inches in diameter was

made, on which the bright streaks are repi'esented by lines of minute spherules of

transparent glass attached to the surface. These possess in a marked degree the

desired property of remaining inconspicuous under cross light, while they flash

out brilliantly when lit up from the front. Although the spherules are but l-50th

to I-30th inch in diameter, they are still too large in propoi'tion to the model, and

therefore east perceptible shadows when they would otherwise be invisible. This

might have been largely avoided by the tedious process of partially imbedding

them in the model. The corresponding diameJer on the moon's surface would be

from 2 to 3.^ miles.

    When suitably illuminated the phases of the model were found, on photometric

examination, to follow a law not very unlike that of the lunar phases as derived

by Zcillner from his own observations, and those of Sir John Herscbel, the light of

the 'full moon' being nearly five times that at quadrature. Without streaks the

model closely agreed with Lambert's formula for a non-reflectiug sphere, for which

the full disc is 3' 141 6 times as bright as the half disc illuminated from the side.

The paper was illustrated by a diagram showing the relative brightness of the

phases as well as by the model and photographs of the same. The model, suitably

illuminated, was also e.xhibited at the evening conversazioni of the Association.

traces of iron, which are found in even the best purchased sulphate of zinc. The
sulphate of zinc solution may also contain basic sulphates, and it is not homo-
geneous after any variations of temperature. This gives rise to variations of the

electromotive force of the cell, and also to large variations of temperature-coeffi-
cient. The mercurous sulphate bought as pure nearly always contains a great
deal of mercuric sulphate. The effects of these and other causes of variation are
discussed, and an amalgam cell, preferably with a non-saturated solution, recom-
mended.

                            Units. By Professor W. Stroud.

     Present Practiml System of Units.--l. The present practical system of units
is very objectionable on three grounds

    (a) There is no prima facie reason why the practical unit of current should

           be equal to 1-lOth c.g.s. unit.
     (/3) The relation between the other practical electric units and the correspond-

         ing c.g.s. units is much more complex than need be.
     (y) The units of work and power are far too small for practical requirements.

    2. If we were starting to devise a practical system to-day, such a system could

best be formed by taking lO^cm. as the unit of length, 10-"gm. as the unit of mass,
and the second as unit of time.

     3. That in the interests of the ' practical ' men of the future and in the inter-

ests of _the_ electrical students of both the present and the future, it is highly desir-
able to initiate a revolution with the object of dethroning the present practical system

of units.

     Nomenclature.-- 1. That the term Dyne to indicate 10^ of our present (1891)
dynes is objectionable, as custom has restricted the use of Greek derivatives entirely

to c.g.s. luiits.

     That 10' dynes, if required, might be called a Hebdomodyne, suitably con-

     On a Table to Facilitate the Conversion of Electrostatic and Electromagnetic
    Measures into one another. By G. Johi;soh^e Stoney, M.A., D.Sc, F.B.S.

       ^ = '*'^> for the repulsion between two quantities of electricity.

                              and c depending on the speciBc inductive capacities of the
                           medium for electricity and magnetism.

     The dimensions of the various units in electricity and magnetism, if written
out in full, would contain these coefficients, which are so related that able" \a a

owino- to Clerk Maxwell, and the author suggested that it shall he called the
Maxwell. It appears from the electromagnetic theory of light that it is also the

velocity of light.

    The above relation may be written in either of the forms,

                                           a = v, ~, orb = v,~.

Accordingly, if we choose to confine our attention to the cases in which c^ja has

its unit of value,

        =b ?' [multiplied by a coefficient of dimensions, c-/«, and of unit value] ;

and if, on the other hand, we confine our attention to the cases in which c'-jb has

its unit of value,

        « = y [multiplied by a coefficient of dimensions, c"jb, and of unit value].

     The first of these assumptions is that the specific inductive capacity for elec-
tricity of the medium (usually air) is taken as our unit of specific inductive
capacity for electricity, and the second assumption is that the specific inductive
capacity for magnetism of the medium is taken as the unit of specific inductive

capacity for magnetism.                the  first                                                       .  are      ,, j  eli ec^trost4. at-.i· c

ism that is there present, over the electricity, over the mass, and over the volume
occupied (producing buoyancy), if the surrounding medium is excluded from it.
There are, therefore, four potencies at each point of space, each being one factor ot
a force, the other factor being a quantity of magnetism, of electricity, of mass, or

of volume, as the case may be. The author also expressed his hope that the
phrases electromotive force and pressure may be discontinued, for what is in fact

one factor of an energy, the other factor being a quantity of electricity. Voltage,

which has in some degree come into use, was recommended instead.

Absolute Units of Measurement. By AV. Moox.

The disadvantages of the C.G.S. system of units are that tlie units are so small

that one can form no conception of their value, and that owing to this smallness it

is necessary to introduce a separate set of practical units for ordinary purposes of

measurement. These disadvantages may be overcome by taking as fundamental

Munits L and larger or T smaller.

    Of all the systems of metrical units that can be formed by varying L and T by

multiples or sub-multiples of ten, that system is the best that is founded upon the

' Decimetre, Kilogramme, and Decisecond.' If the name 'Instant' were given to

the Decisecond, the system could be spoken of as the D.K.I, system.

In the D.K.I, system ' g' = -981, or nearly unity, so that the weight of a kilo-

o-ramme could be  taken  as the  unit of force  for  rough  calculations.                                                            This would  be
                                                                                                                                  _

a great improvement, since the simplest way to conceive a force is as the weight

of unit mass.

   A prepared table shows that all the D.K.I, units are sufficiently large to be

used for practical purposes, and that all the multiples and sub-multiples of them

that would be required could be expressed by the usual Greek prefixes to their

names.
     To express the large numbers required for insulation, resistances, and the small

capacities of condensers, the Greek prefixes ' omega ' and ' omicron ' might be used

for powers of 10 and 10-' respectively.

    By turning the micrometer screw of tlie pendulum-interruptor, and thus chang-
ing tlie distance between the contacts, t can be varied and a large number of points

on the logarithmic curve found. By a process of calibration with the pendulum,

it was found that the electrometer-throws were strictly proportional to the poten-

tials Pfy This calibration was made by taking a w so small that the exponential
term vanished and measuring p for various p^s.

    The resistances used were made by ruling pencil lines upon finely-ground glass,
upon the ends of which a thin film of platinum had been firmly deposited by bum-

ing in and soldering the connecting wires to this, giving a firm and reliable con-

nection to tlie resistance.

     The condenser was a large plate-condenser, 50 cm. in diameter, whose capacity

was found by Kirchhoft''s formula.  Three capacities, 350'204, 770-513, and

998'459 cm. were used, with resistances of from one-half to five megohms.

The time-constant of the pendulum was found by the method of Pouillet for

short intervals, by means of a ballistic galvanometer. One division of the micro-

meter was found to correspond to

ia346 X 10-5 sec.

     In the experiments, readings were taken at intervals between 100 and 2,000
micrometer-divisions.

   A large number of observations was taken, in which all the measured quanti-

ties c, XV, and t were varied.

4. On the Magnetic Field in the neicjhhourhood of the South London Elec-
    trical Eaihvay. By Professor W. E, Ayeton, F.B.S., and Professor

     EiJCKEK, F.B.S.

    Observations were made by means of a mirror galvanometer the period of
which was 10 sec, and which was used as a magnetometer. The instrument was
placed in two rooms about 70 and 180 feet respectively' from the centre of the
road, under which the railway runs at a depth of about 70 feet. It is belisved that
the earth was acting as the return portion of the circuit. In accord with this
the instrument was found to be in continual vibration. The amplitude of the
swing at the station nearer to the railway was often 50 mm., and the law of decrease
with distance appeared to be inversely as the first power. It is, therefore, evident
that experiments of the most ordinary accuracy could not be made within a very

great distance of such a railway.

      Application of Boscovicli s Theory of Atoms to the Atoms of the Chemist.
      By William Baklow, F.G.S.

     After mentioning that he read papers on the same subject at the meetings of
the British Association at Aberdeen in 1885 and Leeds in 1890, the author states
that he is now prepared to deal with the matter in a more general way, and to
submit proof that the mutual interaction of ditierent kinds of atoms present in
582 EEPOET-- 1891.

simple proportions is competent to produce tlie various kinds of symmetry

--exliibited by crystals if the fundamental doctrine of Boscovich is admitted that

the ultimate atoms are points endowed each with inertia, and with mutual attrac-

--tions or repulsions dependent on mutual distances repulsion manifesting itself at

the smallest distances and becoming infinite at infinitely small distances.
     After referring to the principal views which have been put forward as to the

nature of the molecules or units of crystals he goes on to argue that stable
equilibrium of a group of atoms endowed with Boscovich 's properties is evidently
found in that disposition of the atoms which gives the repulsions greatest play
that it is, in fact, the arrangement in which the packing is closest, or, in the lan-
guage of modern conceptions, the arrangement in which the potential energy of
the system is a minimum.

    He then proceeds to answer the question, AVhat groupmg of a concourse of

atoms will give closest packing ? first pointing out that the answer depends on
whether the atoms are of difl'erent kinds, and, if they are, on the numerical pro-
portion of each kind present, and also on the relative magnitude of the spaces
they occupy, or, in other words, on their relative capacities for repelling or being

repelled.

     For simplicity sake, he takes first the imaginary case of atoms confined to the
same plane, and points out that if there are two kinds of atoms present in equal
numbers, one of which exercises a feebler repulsion than the other, their repulsions
may be so proportioned that closest packing will be attained when one kind of
atom lies at the angles of a system of equal squares fitted close together, the other
at the centres of the same squares.

     lie then applies similar reasoning to cases of atoms not in the same plane, and,
after remarking that atoms which are all of one kind will pack closest when their
centres have the relative situation of the centres of a close-packed assemblage of

--equal globes a familiar example of which is found in the stacking of cannon-
--shot he states that the more general case of the closest packing of two or more

kinds of atoms is approximately depicted by the closest packing of globes, if the
globes are of different sizes, to represent the effects of the difference in the repul-
sions exercised by the different atoms.

     After saying that the nature of the grouping in which stable equilibrium is
found will depend on the ratio between the lengths of the radii of the globes
employed, the author traces the nature of the grouping for several particular
values of this ratio.

     He points out that not only hololiedral groupings corresponding to the simpler

forms of the crystallographic systems can be obtained in this way, but that the
more complicated partial symmetry of hemihedral and tetartohedral forms are
also to be obtained.

     As examples of the latter he gives a grouping in closest-packing that has the
precise symmetry of zinc-blende ZnS, which, according to Groth, crystallises in

the tetra'edrische hemiedrie of the cubic system, and another grouping that has the
precise symmetry of cuprite Cu-0, which, according to Groth, crystallises in the
plagiedrische hemiedrie of the cubic system. The numerical proportion of the
spheres of different radius employed is, in each case, that of the atoms present in
the molecule of the compound represented.

     Polar-pyroelectric phenomena and circular polarisation are, the author points
out, associated with peculiarities of the internal symmetry of the groupings, which
correspond in outward symmetry with tlie bodies displaying these phenomena.

      The grouping is portrayed by beads of different colours suspended in space
in the symmetrical manner requisite in each case.

     The author concludes his paper by referring to some geometrical properties of
the symmetrical systems of the crystallographer which he has discovered by an
extension of the methods adopted by Bravais and by Sohncke, and which have
greatly facilitated his work in finding symmetrical groupings to fit the forms and
composition of a variety of diflferent substances.

   --The phenomena related to the above hypothesis are as follows :

   --1. Earthquakes and Earth-currents. -From a comparison of observations at

700 stations in Japan, there seems to be no connection between earthquakes and

abnormal disturbances on land lines. It would, however, seem that any subterra-

change of potential at a and b, and that therefore no change of current should be

expected. Thus the hypothesis is not opposed to the facts.

  --2. Connection be.tiveen Earthqualies and Yolcanoes. Most earthquakes do not

originate at volcanoes, but below the sea or on the coast-line where flat ground
suddenly slopes down below a deep ocean. From the hypothesis we should expect

that the greatest electric stress, and therefore the greatest disruptive stress, would

be between B and 0.

  --3. Potential at Hot Springs. Measurements made at seven springs in the

same valley extending from Yumoto, 100 to 200 feet above sea-level, to Ashiuoyu

3,000 feet above sea-level. Between a hot spring and the earth, 10 to 100 yards

distant, the diiTerence at the foot of the valley is about -05 of a volt, but at high

elevations, where the water is most sulphurous, the difference rose to 0'6 volt.

The difference of potential between b and a neighbouring point ought to

increase when 6 is a volcanic vent. The existence of sulphurous water, however,

is not to be overlooked.

taken of the difierence of the potentials of the water in a well 30 feet deep, and of

a point on the surface of the earth 25 yards off. At the time of three small earth-
quakes deflections equivalent to 2 or volts were observed, but they may have

been due to mechanical disturbance.

                                                                    THURSDAY, AUGUST 20.

Tlie President delivered the foUj-winT- Address :

The selection of Cai-diff as a place of meeting of the British Association led to the

presidency of Section B being entrusted to a metallurgist. It will be well, there-

fore, to deal in this address mainly with considerations connected with the subject

to which my life has been devoted, and I hope that it may be possible for me to

show that this practical art has both promoted the advancement of science and

has received splendid gifts in return.

It is an art for which in this country we have traditional love ; nevertheless

tlie modes of teaching it, and its influence on science, are but imperfectly under-

stood and appreciated. Practical metallurgists are far too apt to think that

improvements in their processes are mainly the result of their own experience and

observation, unaided by pure science. On the other hand, those who teach

metallurgy often forget that for the present they have not only to give instruction

in the method of conducting technical operations, but have truly to educate, by

teaching the chemistry of high temperatures, at which ordinary reactions are

modified or even reversed, while they have further to deal with many phenomena

of much importance, which cannot, as j'et, be traced to the action of elements in

fixed atomic proportions, or in which the direct influence of the atom is only

beginning to be recognised.

The development of a particular art, like that of an organism, proceeds from

its internal  activity                                       it is  work  which  promotes  its  growth  and  not  the external
                                                          ;

influence of the environment. In the early stage of the development of an

industry the craftsmen gather a store of facts which afford a basis for the labours

of the investigator, who penetrates the circle of the ' mystery ' and renders know-

ledge scientific. Browning, inspired by the labours of a chemist, finely tells us in

his ' Paracelsus ' :

                                                                                 To know

                      Eather consists in opening out a way

                      "Whence the imprisoned splendour may escape,

                      Than in effecting entry for a light

                      Supposed to be without.

    If it be asked who did most in gaining the industrial treasure and in revealing

the light of chemical knowledge, tlie answer is certainly the metallurgists, whose

labours in this respect difler materially from others which have ministered to the

welfare of mankind. First it may be urged that in no other art have the relations
between theory and practice been so close and enduring. Bacon, who never

undervalued research, tells us that in the division of the labour of investiga-

tion in the New Atlantis there are some ' that raise the former discoveries by
TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  585

 experiment into greater observations, axioms, and aphorisms : these we call the

interpreters of nature.' There are also others 'that bend themselves, lookiug into

the experimentsof their fellows and casting about how to draw out of them things
of use and practice for man's life and knowledge . . . these we call the doicry men

 or benefactors.'' In reviewing the history of metallurgy, especially in our islands,,
it would seem that the two classes of workers, the interpreters of nature and
the practical men, have for centuries sat in joint committee, and, by bringing

theoretical speculation into close connection with hard industrial facts, have-
 ' carried us nearer the essence of truth.'

      The main theme of this address will therefore be the relation between theory-
and practice in metallurgy with special reference to the indebtedness of the
practical man to the scientific investigator.

    We will then consider

         (1) Certain facts connected with ' Oxidation ' and ' Eeduction,' upon which
                    depend operations of special importance to the metallurgist.

         (2) The influence in metallurgical practice of reactions which are either

                       limited or reversible,

        (·j) The means by which progress in the metallurgic art may be effected^

                     and the special need for studying the molecular constitution of metals
                     and alloys.

     (1) The present year is a memorable one for chemists, being the centenary ot
the birth of Faraday and the bi-cenlenary of the death of Rolert Boyle. The
work of the former has recently been lovingly and fittingly dealt with in the
Royal Institution, where he laboured so long. I would, in turn, briefly recall
the services of Boyle, not, however, on account of the coincidence of date, but

because with him a new era in chemistry began. He knew too much about the

marvellous action of 'traces' of elements on masses of metal to feel justified
in pronoimcing absolutely against the possibilities of transmutation, but he did
splendid service by sweeping away the firm belief that metals consist of sulphur,

salt, and mercury, and by giving us the definition of an element. He recognised

the preponderating influence of metallurgy in the early history of science, and
                          _

quaintly tells us that ' those addicted to chemistry have scarce any views but to
the preparation of medicines or to the improvement of metals,' a statement which
was perfectly correct, for chemistry was built up on a tlierapeutic as well as a
metallurgic basis. The fact is, however, that neither the preparation of materials
to be employed in healing, nor the study of their action, had anything like the
influence on the growth of theoretical chemistry which was exerted by a few

simple metallurgical processes. Again, strange as it may seem, theoretical
chemistry was more directly advanced by observations made in connection with

methods of purifying the precious metals, and by the recognition of the quantitative

significance of the results, than by the acquisition of facts incidentally gathered in
the search for a transmuting agent. The belief that chemistry ' grew out of
alchemy ' nevertheless prevails, and has found expression in this Section of the
British Association. As a fact, however, the great metallurgists treated the search
for a transmuting agent with contempt, and taught the necessity of ' investigation
for its own sake. George Agricola, the most distinguished of the" sixteenth-century
metallurgists, in his work ' De Ortu et Causis Subterraneorum ' (lib. v.), written
about the year 1539, disdainfully rejects both the view of the alchemists that
metals consist of sulphur and mercury, and their pretended ability to change silver
into gold by the addition of foreign matter.

    Biringuccio (1540) says, ' I am one of those who ignore the art of the alchemists
entirely. They mock nature when tliey say that with their medicines they correct

its delects, and render imperfect metals perfect.' 'The art,' he adds, 'was not
worthy of tlie consideration of the wise ancients who strove to obtain possible
things.' In his time, reaction between elements meant their destruction and re-
constitution, nevertheless his sentence ' transmutation is impossible, because in order
to transmute a body you must begin by destroying it altogether,' suggests that
he realised the great principle of the conservation of mass upon which the science
586 KEPOKT-- 1891.

Weof chemistry is based.  have also the testimony of the German metallurgist,

Becher, who improved our tin-smelting' in Cornwall, He is said to have caused

a medal to be struck in 1675, which bore tlie legend : ' Hanc uuciam argenti
finissimi ex plumbo arte alchymica transmutavi/ though he should have been aware

that he had only extracted the precious metal from the lead, and had not trans-

muted the base one. This is a lapse which must be forgiven him, for his terra
pinguis was the basis of tlie theory of Phlogiston, which exerted so profound an

influence for a century after his death, and he wrote, ' I wist that I have got hold

of my pitcher by the right handle, for the pseudo-chemists seek gold, but I have

the true philosophy, science, which is more precious.'
    At this critical period what was Boyle doing when the theory of Phlogiston

dawned in the mind of the metallurgist Becher ? In 1672 JBoyle wrote his

paper on ' Fire and flame weighed in the balance,' and came to the conclusion that

the ' ponderous parts of flame ' could pass through glass to get at melted lead con-

tained in a closed vessel. It has been considered strange that he did not interpret

the experiment correctly, but he, like the phlogistic chemists, tried to show that

the subtiUs i(jnis, the material of fire or phlogiston, would penetrate aU things,

and could be gained or lost by them. Moreover, his later experiments showed him

that glass was powerless to screen u'on from the ' efliuvium of a loadstone.' His

experiment with lead heated in a closed glass vessel was a fundamental one, to
which his mind would naturally revert if he could come back now and review the

present state of our knowledge in the light of the investigations which have been

made in the two centuries that have passed since his own work ceased. If he

turned to the end of the first century after his death he would see that the failure

to appreciate the work of predecessors was as prevalent in the eighteenth century as

in the sixteenth. The spirit of intolerance which led Paracelsus to publicly burn,

in his inaugural lecture at Basle, the works of Galen, ?Iippocrates, and Avicenna,

survived in the eighteenth century when Madame Lavoisier burnt the works of

Stahl, but it was reserved for the nineteenth century to reverently gather the ashes,

recognising that when the writers of the School of Becher spoke of Phlogiston

they meant what we understand by potential energy.

If Boyle, finding that the Fellows of the Royal Society had not carried out

their intention to l)uild a ' Repository and Laboratory,' sought tlie School of Mines

and came to the Royal College of Science he would surely thank my colleague.

Professor Thorpe, for his vigorous defence last year, as President of this Section,

of the originality of the work of Priestley and Cavendish, to which Boyle's own

researches had directly led. "\Ve on our part, remembering Berzelius's view that

' oxygen is the centre point round wliich chemistry revolves,' would hope to interest
him most by selecting the experiments which arose out of the old metallurgical

operation of separating the precious metals from lead by ' cupellation.' When, in

conducting this operation, lead is heated in the presence of air it becomes converted

into a very fluid dross. Boyle had, in 1661, taken this operation as the very first

illustration in his ' Sceptical Chemist ' in proof of his argument as to tlie elemental

nature of metals. He would remember the quantitative work of Geber in the
eighth century, who stated that the lead so heated in air acquired a ' new weight,'

and he would appreciate the constant reference to the ojieration of cupellation from

the close of the sixth century B.C., when tlie prophet Jeremiah wrote, to the work

of Jean Rey in 1629, whose conclusions he would wish he had examined more

closely. Lord Brouncker, as first President of the Royal Society, had called atten-

tion to the increase in weight of the lead in the ' coppels ' in the Assay Oflice in the

Mint in the Tower, and Slayo had shown that the increase in weight comes from a

distinct 'spiritus' in the air. Boyle would incidentally see that Newton had

accepted office in the Mint, where he doubtless continued his experiments on cal-

cination begun some time before, and, as if to mark his interest in the operation of

assaying, figures are represented on a bas-relief on his tomb in Westminster Abbey

as conducting cupellation in a muffle. The old work merges wonderfully into

the new. Chevreul, in the nineteenth century, confirms Otto Tachen's view in the

seventeenth, as to the saponifying action of litharge. Deville employs molten

litharge to absorb oxygen dissociated from its compounds, and Graham, by extract-
TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  587

ing occluded gases from iron and otlier metals, proves the accuracy of the old'
belief that elastic fluids can freely permeate even solid metals.

   We may imagine with what vivid interest Boyle woidd turn, not merely to the

results of Priestley's work, but to his methods. Priestley had decomposed litharge

with the electric spark, and had satisfied himself in 1774 by heating red lead that

the gas he obtained in his earlier experiments was really the one now called oxygen.
     Boyle would see that in the period 1774-7 Lavoisier, being attracted by the

' sceptical chemist's ' own experiment on the heating of lead in closed vessels, over-
threw the Phlogistic theory and placed chemistry on a firm basis by showing that
the increase in weight of lead and tin, when heated in air, represents exactly the

weight of the gaseous body added, and, finally, Dalton having developed the atomic
theory and applied it to chemistry, Berzelius made lead memorable by selecting it

for the first determination of an atomic weight.
     Withont diverting his attention -from the phenomena of oxidation, Boyle would

find questions the interest of which is only equalled by their present obscurity.

He would contemplate the most interesting phase of the history of chemical science,

described by van 't lioff as that of its evolution from the descriptive to the

rational period, in the early days of which the impossibility of separating physics

and chemistry became evident, and Boyle would find that chemistry is now

regarded from the point of view of the mechanics of the atoms.
      Deville's experiments on dissociation have rendered it possible to extend to the

groups of atoms in chemical systems the laws which govern the fusion and
vaporisation of masses of matter, and this has produced a revolution comparable

in its importance to that which followed the discovery of the law of definite pro-
portions, for dissociation has shown us that true causes of chemical change are
variations of pressure and of temperature. For instance, oxygen may be prepared
on an industrial scale from air by the intervention of oxide of barium heated to a
constant temperature of 700°, provided air be admitted to the heated oxide of

barium, under a pressure of li atmospheres, while the oxygen, thus absorbed, is

evolved if the containing vessel be rendered partially vacuous. It will be evident,
therefore, that at a certain critical temperature and pressiu-e the slightest variation
of either will destroy the equilibrium of the system and induce chemical change.

     The aim of Boyle's chemical writings was to show that no barrier exists between
physics and chemistry, and to ' serve the commonwealth of learning by begetting
a good understanding betwixt the chemists and the mechanical philosophers,' who
had, as he said, ' been too great strangers to each other's discoveries.' In view of
the dominant lines of research which occupy chemists at the present time, such,
for instance, as the investigations of ' Osmotic pressure ' and of the application of
Boyle's own law to salts in solution, he would ieel that his hope had been realised,
and that, though he lived a century too soon to take part in Berthollet's discussion
with Proust, he nevertheless shares Berthollet's triumph in the long-delayed but
now rapid development of chemistry as a branch of applied mechanics.

     "We need, however, no longer look at these questions from the point of view of

Boyle, for our own interest in the application of chemical mechanics to metallurgy

is sufficiently vivid, as instances to be given subsequently will show.
     Hitherto I have mainly dwelt on questions relating to oxidation, but not less

interesting is the history of the steps by which an accurate knowledge was ac-
quired of the other great process practised by the metallurgist, the one to which
Paracelsus was the first to apply thQ name of ' Heduction.' Its explanation fol-
lowed naturally from the elucidation of the phenomena of combustion by Lavoisier,
who in continuation of Macquer's experiments of 1771 proved, in conjunction with
other workers, that carbonic anhydride is produced when the diamond is burnt in
air or oxygen. Carbon has been known for ages as the most important of the
reducing agents, but when, in 1772, Lavoisier heated oxide of lead and carbon
together, he did not at first recognise that carbonic anhydride had been produced,
simply because the volume of the gas set free was the same as if oxygen merely

had been liberated. He soon, however, saw that neither the carbon alone, nor

the oxide of lead alone, gave rise to the evolution of carbonic anhydride, which
resulted from the mutual action of carbon and a constituent of the litharge. ' This
588 KEPOET-- 1891.

last observation leads us insensibly,' he adds, ' to Tery important reflections on the

use of carbon in the reduction of metals.' It most certainly did, and by 1815 an

accurate, if incomplete, view of reduction had passed into the encyclopaedias. It

was seen that the removal of oxygen from burnt metals, by carbon, ' give the

metals,' as Fourcroy and Vauquelin put it, ' a new existence.' Some ten years

later Le Play attempted to show that reduction is always effected by the inter-

vention of carbonic oxide, which elicited the classical rejoinder from Gay-Lussac,

who pointed out that ' carbon alone, and at very moderate temperatures, will-

reduce certain metallic oxides without the intervention of carbonic oxide or of

any other elastic fluid.' I mention these facts because metallurgists are slow to

recognise their indebtedness to investigators, and too often ignore the extreme

pains with which an accurate knowledge has been acquired of the principles upon

which their processes have been based.

The importance of a coherent explanation of reduction in smelting pig-iron is

enormous. The largest blast-furnaces in 1815 hardly exceeded those in use in the

previous century, and were at most only 40 feet high witli a capacity of 5,000

cubic feet. At the present day their gigantic successors are sometimes 90 feet

high with a capacity of 25,000 cubic feet. This development of the blast-furnace

is due to the researches of a number of investigators, among whom von Tunner,

WeLowthian Bell, and Griiner deserve special mention.     are, however, forcibly re-

minded of the present incompleteness of our knowledge of the mechanism of reduc-

tion, when we remember that the experiments of 11. B. Baker have led us to

believe that pure carbon cannot be burnt in perfectly dry and pure oxygen, and

therefore that the reducing agent, carbonic oxide, would not be produced at all

unless moisture be present.

Ludwig Mond, Langer, and Quincke teach us not only that nickel can

separate carbon from carbonic oxide, but the wholly unexpected fact that dry

carbonic oxide can at a temperature of 100° take up nickel, which it again

deposits if heated to 150°. Mond and Quincke and, independently, Berthelot,

have since proved the existence of the corresponding compound of iron and carbonic
oxide, and it may safely be concluded that in the blast-furnace smelting iron this

peculiar action of carbonic oxide plays an important part, and it doubtless aids the

carburisatiou of iron by cementation. It is truly remarkable that the past year

should have brought us so great an increase in our knowledge of what takes place

in the reduction of an oxide of iron, and in the carburisation of the liberated

Mymetal.  own experiments have, I trust, made it clear that iron can, at an ele-

vated temperature, be carburised by the diamond  in       vacuo                         that is, in  the  absence
                                                                                     ;

of anything more than ' a trace ' of an elastic fluid or of any third element.

Osmond has further shown within the last few months that the action between

iron and carbon is a mutual one, for though carbon in the pure diamond form car-

burises iron, the metal in its turn, at a temperature of 1,0.50°, attacks the diamond,

invests it with a black layer, and truly unites with it.

The question of the direct carburisation of iron (Darby's process) by filtering

the molten metal through carbon, promises to be of much importance, for at pre-

sent, as is well known, two millions of tons of steel which are made in the

Bessemer converter in this country alone, are re-carburised after ' the blow ' by

the addition of spiegeleisen.

Carbonic oxide, moreover, would appear to be more chemically active than had

been supposed ; for during the present year Berthelot has shown that the perfectly
pure gas heated to .500° or 550° produces carbonic anhydride with deposition of

carbon at red heat, not by ordinary dissociation, but by decomposition preceded by

polymerisation. He further shows that carbonic oxide will decompose ammoniacal

nitrate of silver, and thus brings it into close connection with the aldehydes.

     (2) In turning to the modern aspects of metallurgical practice, we shall see that
the whole range of the metallurgist's field of study is changing. It is no longer
possible for him to devise a series of operations on the evidence afiforded by a set
of equations which indicate the completion of an operation; he has, as I have already
suggested, to consider the complicated problems which have been introduced into
                          TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  589

chemistry from the sciences of physics and mechanics. lie has, in fact, no ]onf,'er to

deal merely with atoms and molecules, hut with the influence of mass. As Ostwald
points out, we are reminded that many chemical processes are reciprocating so that
the original bodies may be obtained from the product of the reaction. The result

of such opposed processes is a state of chemical EauiLiERiuM, in which both the

original and the newly-formed substances are present in definite quantities that

remain the same so long as the conditions, more especially temperature and pres-
sure, do not undergo further change. Again, in very many metallurgical processes,

reactions are rendered incomplete by the limitations imposed by the presence of

bodies which cannot be speedily eliminated from the system, and the result may

be to greatly retard the completion of an operation. The time has come when the

principles of dynamic chemistry must be applied to the study of metallurgical pro-

blems if they are to be correctly understood, and it is, moreover, necessary to

remember the part played by the surface separating the different aggregates in

contact with one another. When, for instance, a reaction has to take place accom-

panied by the evolution of gas, there must be space into which the gas can pass.

The rate, therefore, at which change takes place will obviously depend on the state

of division of the mass.

One of the most remarkable points in the whole range of chemistry is the action

engendered between two elements capable of reacting by the presence of a third

body. It may be, and this is the most wonderful fact of all, that merelj' a trace

of a third body is necessary to induce reaction, or to profoundly modify the struc-

ture of a metal. H. Le Ghatelier and Mouret have pointed out that in certain

cases it is inaccurate to say that the third body causes the reaction to take place,

because, after it has destroyed the inter-molecular resistances which prevented the

reaction taking place, the third body ceases to intervene. This is apparently the

case when platinum sponge effects the union of oxygen and hydrogen, or conveisely,

when very hot platinum splits up water vapour into its constituent gases. Future

investigation will, it is to be hoped, show whether the platinum does not e.\ert

Wesome direct action in both cases.  can no longer neglect the study of such

questions from the point of view of their practical application. The manufacture

of red-lead presents a case in point. In ' dressing' molten lead, the oxidation of the

lead is greatly promoted by the presence of a trace of antimony, and conversely, in

the separation of silver from molten lead, by the aid of zinc, H. Eoessler and

Endelmanu have recently shown that aluminium has a remarkable effect in pro-

tecting the zinc from loss by oxidation, and, further, the presence of one-thousandth

part of aluminium in the zinc is sufficient to exert this protecting action on that

metal. I am satisfied that if our metallurgists are to advance their industrial

practice, they must, if I may use such an expression, persistently think in calories,

and not merely employ the ordinary atomic ' tools of thought.' They will then

be able to state what reactions can, under given conditions, take place ; to indicate
those which will be completed ; and to avoid those that are impracticable.

    In France, the country of so many great metallurgists, men like Le Ghatelier

and Ditte are doing admirable service by bringing the results of the labours and

teaching of St. Claire Deville within the range of practical men. And if I do not

refer more specifically to their work it is for want of space and not of appreciation,

but a few simple cases of reversible actions will perhaps make the subject clear. In

the blast-furnace the main reducing agent, carbonic oxide, is produced from the solid

fuel by the reaction CO., -i- C = 2 CO, a reaction which is theoretically impossible

because it is endothermic, and wotdd be attended by absorption of heat. But heat

external to the system intervenes, and acts either by depolymerising the carbon

into a simpler form which can combine with oxygen of the CO., with evolution of

heat, or by dissociating carbonic anhydride sets oxygen free which combines with

the carbon. Reduction of oxide of iron in the blast-furnace is mainly effected by

carbonic oxide according to the well-known reaction

                          Fe^Oj + SCO = 2Fe + SCO^.

     But the gas issuing from a blast-furnace contains carbonic oxide, an important
source of heat. The view that this loss of carbonic oxide was due to the fact that
--590 REPORT 1891.

the contact of tbe ore and the reducing gas was not sufficiently prolonged, led to a

great increase in the height of blast-furnaces, but without, as Griiner showed,

diminishing the proportion of carbonic oxide escaping from the throat. The re-

duction of an iron ore by carbonic oxide only takes place within certain well-

defined limits, and a knowledge of the laws of chemical equilibrium would have

saved thousands and thousands of pounds which have been wasted in building

unduly high furnaces. I would add that large sums have also been sacrificed in

the vain attempt to smelt oxide of zinc in the blast-furnace, for which operation

patents have frequently been sought, in ignorance or defiance of the readiness with

which the inverse action occurs, so that the reducing action of carbon on oxide of

zinc may be balanced by the re-oxidation of the reduced zinc by carbonic anhydride,
Awhich is the product of the reduction.
                                            further instance may be borrowed from

an electro-chemical process which has been adopted for obtaining alloys of

aluminium. As is well known, all attempts to effect the direct reduction of

alumina by carbon have failed, because the reaction

2(Al203) + 3C = 4Al + .'3C02

requires 783 '2 calories, while only 291 calories would result from the conversion

of carbon into carbonic anhydride, therefore the reaction cannot be effected ; but in

Cowle's process aluminium is nevertheless liberated when alumina is mixed with

charcoal and strongly heated by the passage of an electric current. This result is

due, not to a simple reduction of alumina, but to its dissociation at the high tem-

perature produced by the passage of a current of 1,600 amperes between carbon

poles, the liberated aluminium being at once removed from the system by metallic

copper which is simidtaneously present and may not be without action itself.
    An instance of the importance of these considerations is presented in the

manufacture of steel by the basic process. Much care is devoted to obtain-

ing conditions which will ensure not only the elimination, but the order of the

disappearance of the impurities from the molten pig iron. In the basic process as

conducted in the closed converter, the phosphorus does not disappear until the

carbon has left the fluid bath, whilst, when the open-hearth furnace is used, the
elimination of the phosphorus may be effected before that of the carbon, and it is

asserted that if the carbon goes before the phosphorus is got rid of, a further
Aaddition of carbon is necessary.
                                   curious and subtle case of chemical equilibrium

is here presented. In the open-hearth furnace and Bessemer converter respectively,

the temperatures and pressures are different', and the conditions as to the presenta-

tion of oxygen to the fluid bath are not the same. The result is that the relative

rates of oxidation of the phosphorus and carbon are different in the two cases,

although in either case, with a given method of worldng, there must be a ratio

between the phosphorus and carbon in which they disappear simultaneously.

The industrial bearing of the question is very remarkable. In the basic Bessemer

process the tendency of the phosphorus to linger in the bath renders an ' after-

blow ' necessary, it may be only of a few seconds' duration, but much iron is never-
theless burnt and wasted, and Mr. Gilchrist tells me that if this after-blow could

be avoided, a saving of some six per cent, of the yield of steel would be effected

annuallj', the value of which, at the present rate of output and price of steel, is no

less than a quarter of a million sterling.

     The larger loss of sulphur by the steel in the converter than that which occurs
in the open-hearth furnace, and the increase in the percentage of manganese, which

leaves the slag and returns to the bath of metal in the converter at the end of the

' blow,' will probably be traced to the disturbance of equilibrium which attends
very slight variations in the conditions, especially as regards temperature and

pressm-e, under which the operations are conducted.

In the blast-furnace the reducing action must be greatly dependent on the rate

at which alkaline cyanides are formed, and Hempel has recently shown, by the
aid of well-devised experiments, that the quantity of cyanides which may be

obtained at a high temperature from carbon, nitrogen, and alkaline oxides, increases

as the pressure becomes greater.

Metallurgical chemistry is, in fact, a special branch of chemical science which
                         TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  591

does not come within the ordiuaiy sphere of the academic teaching; of chemistry.
It is often urj^ed that metalhirrjical practice depends upon the application of
chemical principles which are well taught in every large centre of instruction in
this country, but a long series of chemical reactions exist which are of vital
importance to the metallurgist, though they are not set forth in any British manual

of chemistry, nor are dealt with in courses of purely chemical lectures. I feel
bound to insist upon this point, because, as Examiner in Metallurgy for the Science

and Art Department, I find that purely analytical and laboratory methods are so

often given in the belief that they are applicable to processes conducted on a large

scale and at high temperatures.

   We are told that technical instruction should be kept apart from scientific

education, which consists in preparing the student to apply the results of past
experience in dealing with entirely new sets of conditions, but it can be shown
that there is a whole side of metallurgical teaching which is truly educational, and

leads students to acquire the habit of scientific thought as surely as the investiga-

tion of any other branch of knowledge.

It is, in fact, hardly possible in a course of theoretical chemistry to devote

much attention to specific cases of industrial practice in which reactions are incom-

plete, because they are limited by the presence of bodies that cannot be directly

eliminated from the chemical system. Take, for instance, the long series of re-

actions studied by Plattner, who published the results of his investigations in his
celebrated treatise, * Die Metallurgische Rostprozesse,' Freiberg, 1856, whose work

I have chosen as a starting-point on account of our presence iu South Wales near

Athe great copper smelting district of Swansea.  complex sulphide, of which

copper is the main metallic constituent, contains some fifty ounces of silver to the

ton. The problem may be supposed for the present to be limited to the extraction

of the precious metal from the mass in which it is hidden, and the student deriving
his knowledge from an excellent modern chemical treatise "vvould find the case

thus stated :

' Ziervogel's process depends upon the fact that when argentiferous copper pyrites

is roasted, the copper and iron sulphides are converted into insoluble oxides, whilst

the silver is converted into a soluble sulphate which is dissolved out by lixiviating

the roasted ore with hot water, the silver being readily precipitated from this solution

in the metallic state.'

                         f

     It is certain that if an observant, chemically-trained student visited a silver
extraction works, and possessed sufficient analytical skill to enable him to secure
evidence as to the changes that occur, he would find a set of facts which his train-
ing had not enabled him to predict, and he would establish the existence of a set of
reactions to the nature of which his chemical reading had hardly given him a clue.
The process to be considered is a simple one, but it is typical, and applies to a
large proportion of the 7,000,000 ounces of silver annually obtained in the world

from cupriferous compounds. He would be confronted with a ton or more of

finely divided material spread in a thin layer over the bed of a reverberatory fur-

nace. Suppose the material is what is known as a complex regulus as imported
into Swansea or produced at Freiberg, to which are added rich native sulphides.
The mixture then consists of sulphides mainly of iron and copper, with some sulphide

of lead, and contains fifty or sixty ounces of silver to the ton, and a few grains

of gold. It may also contain small quantities of arsenic and antimony as arsenides,
antimonides, and sulpho-salts, usually with copper as a base.

     The temperature of the furnace in which the operation is to be performed is
gradually raised, the atmosphere being an oxidising one. The first effect of the
elevation of the temperature is to distil oif sulphur, reducing the sulphides to a
lower stage of sulphurisation. This sulphur burns in the furnace atmosphere to
sulphurous anhydride (SO.,), and coming in contact with the material undergoing

oxidation is converted into sulphuric anhydride C^Og). It should be noted that
the material of the brickwork does not intervene in the reactions, except by its
presence as a hot porous mass, but its influence is, nevertheless, considerable. The

roasting of these sulphides presents a good case for the study ef chemieal equili-
--592 EEPORT 1891.

brium. As soon as the sulphurous anhydride reaches a certain tension the

oxidation of the sulphide is arrested, even though an exce«s of oxygen be

present, and the oxidation is not resumed until the action of the draught

changes the conditions of the atmosphere of the furnace, when the lower

sulphides remaining are slowly oxydised, the copper sulphide being converted into

copper sulphate mainly by the intervention of the sulphuric anhydride formed as

indicated. Probably by far the greater part of the iron sulphide only becomes

sulphate for a very brief period, being decomposed into the oxides of iron, mainly

ferric oxide, the sulphur passing off. Anj^ silver sulphide that is present would

have been converted into metallic silver at the outset were it not for the simuj-

taneous presence of other sulphides, notably those of copper and of iron, which

enables the silver sulphide to become converted into sulphate. The lead sulphide

is also converted into sulphate at this low temperature. The heat is now raised

still further witli a view to split up the sulphate of copper, the decomposition of

which leaves oxide of copper. If, as in this case, the bases are weak, the sulphuric

anhydride escapes mainly  as  such                         but  when the sulphates  of stronger bases  are
                                                        ;

decomposed the sulphuric anhydride is to a great extent decomposed into a mix-

ture of sulphurous anhydride and oxygen. The sulphuric anhydride, resulting from

the decomposition of this copper sulphate, converts the silver into sulphate, and

maintains it as such, just as, in turn, at a lower temperature, the copper itself had

been maintained in the form of sulphate by the sulphuric anhydride eliminated

from the iron sulphide. When only a little of the copper sulphate remains unde-

composed, the silver sulphate begins to split up, and the furnace charge must

therefore be immediately withdrawn, or the whole of the silver sulphate would be

converted into metallic silver, partly by the direct action of heat alone, and partly

by reactions such as those shown in the following equations :

Ag2 SO, + i¥efi, = 2Ag + GFe.Oa + SO^
Ag.,SOi+ Cu.O =2Ag + CuSO< + CuO.

If the charge were not withdrawn, the silver would thus be effectually removed

from the solvent action of water, and the smelter's efforts would have failed

entirely. The charge still contains lead sulphate, which cannot be completely

decomposed at any temperature attainable in the roasting furnace, except in the

presence of silica, and it is well to leave it where it is if the residue has subse-

quently to be smelted with a view to the extraction of the gold. The elimination

of arsenic and antimony gives rise to problems of much interest, and again con-

fronts the smelter with a case of chemical equilibrium. For the sake of brevity it

will be well for the present to limit the consideration to the removal of antimony,

which may be supposed to be present as sulphide. Some sulphide of antimony is

Andistilled off, but this is not its only mode of escape.                           attempt to remove

antimony by rapid oxidation would be attended with the danger of converting it

into insoluble antimoniates of the metals present in the charge. In the early

stages of the roasting it is therefore necessary to employ a very low temperature,

and the presence of steam is found to be useful as a source of hydrogen, which

removes sulphur as hydrogen sulphide, the gas being freely evolved. The reaction

                              Sb2S3 + 3H,= 3H2S + 2Sb

between hydrogen and sulphide of antimony is, however, endothermic, and could
not, therefore, take place without the aid which is afforded by external heat. The
facts appear to be as follows : sulphide of antimony, when heated, dissociates, and
the tension of the sulphur vapour would jiroduce a state of equilibrium if the
sulphur thus liberated were not seized by the hydrogen and removed from the
system. The equilibrium is thus destroyed and fresh sulphide is dissociated. The
general result being that the equilibrium of the system is continually restored and
destroyed until the sulphide is decomposed. The antimony combines with oxygen
and escapes as volatile oxide, as does also the arsenic, a portion of which is vola-

tilised as sulphide.

     The main object of the process which has been considered is the formation of
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.                                 593

soluble sulpbate of silver. If arsenic and antimony have not been eliminated, their
presence at the end of the operation will be specially inconvenient, as they
give rise to the formation of arseniate and antimoniate of silver, insoluble in

water, which may necessitate the treatment of the residues by an entirely different
process from that which has hitherto been considered.

     It will have been evident that effecting this series of changes demands the
exercise of the utmost skill, care, and patience. The operations beginning at a
dull red heat, or a temperature of some 500°, are completed at 700°, within a
range, that is, of 200°. Judicious stirring has been necessary to prevent the
formation of crusts of sulphates, which would impede the reactions, and, as has
been shown, an undue elevation of temperature within a very limited range would,
at any stage, have been fatal to the success of the operation. It is difficult to
appreciate too highly the delicacy of sight and touch which enables an operator to
judge by the aid of rough tests, but mainly from the tint of the streak revealed
when tiie mass is rabbled, whether any particular stage has or has not been
reached, and it will be obvious that the requisite skill is acquired solely by obser-
vation and experiment. The technical instructor may impart information as to
the routine to be followed, and the appearances to be observed, but scientific
knowledge of a high order can alone enable the operator to contend with the
disturbing influences introduced by the presence of unexpected elements or by

untoward variations in temperature. In the training of a metallurgist it is
impossible to separate education from instruction, and the above description of a
very ordinary operation will show the intimate relations between science and
practice which are characteristic of metallurgical operations. Practice is depen-

dent on science for its advancement, but scientific workers too often hesitate to
attack metallurgical problems, and to devote the resources of modern investiga-
tion to their solution, because they are not aware of the great interest of the
physical and chemical problems which are connected with many very simple
metallurgical processes, especially with those that are conducted at high tem-

peratures.

      Proceeding yet one step further, suppose that the copper smelter takes posses-
sion of the residual mass, consisting mainly of oxide of copper, he would smelt it

with fresh sulphide ores and obtain, as a slag from the earthy matters of the ore,
a ferrous silicate containing some small proportion of copper. The displacement

of the copper from this silicate may be effected by fusing it with sulphide of iron,

a fusible sulphide of iron and copper being formed which readily separates from

the slag. By this reaction some twenty thousand tons of copper are added to the

world's annual production. Proceeding a step further, suppose the smelter to have
reduced his copper to the metallic state. If arsenic had been originally present in

the ore, and had not been eliminated entirely in the roasting, extraordinary diffi-

culties would be met with in the later stages of the process, in extracting small
quantities of arsenic which resist the smelter's efforts. Copper, moreover, con-
taining above one per cent, of arsenic cannot be ' overpoled,' as the presence of arsenic
hinders the action of gases on the copper. The amount of arsenic which the copper
smelter has to remove may vary from mere traces up to one per cent., and if the
copper is destined for the use of the electrical engineer, he will insist on its being
as pure as possible, for the presence of a trace of arsenic would materially increase
the electrical resistance of the copper, and would be fatal to its use in submarine
telegraphy. If, on the other hand, the copper is intended for the maker of locomo-

tive fire-boxes, he will encourage the retention of small quantities of arsenic, as
 it is found to actually increase the endurance of the copper, and the smelter will
in such a case have no inducement to employ the basic furnace lining which Mr.
 Gilchrist has offered him, nor will he care to use the special methods for the

removal of arsenic with which he is familiar. It may all seem simple enough,
 but the modern process of copper smelting has been laboriously built up, and has a
 long and interesting pedigree which may be traced to at least the eighth century,
 when Geber described the regulus ' coarse metal ' as being ' black mixed with

 livid,' and our famihar 'blue metal ' as being ' of a most clean and pleasant violet

colour,' and indicated the reason for the difference.  QQ

     (3) The foregoing instances have been given to indicate the general nature of
metallurgical chemistry. It will be well now to show how the great advances in

metallurgical practice have been made in the past, with a view to ascertain

what principles should guide us in the future.

It is a grave mistake to suppose that in industry, any more than in art, national

advance takes place always under the guidance of a master possessed of some new

gift of invention, yet we have been reminded that we are apt to be reverent to

these alone, as if the nation had been unprogressive, and suddenly awakened by the

genius of one man. The way for any great technical advance is prepared by the

patient acquisition of facts by investigators of pure science. Whether the in-

vestigators are few or many, and consequently whether progress is slow or rapid,

Awill depend in no small measure on the spirit of the nation as a whole.  genius

whose practical order of mind enables him to make some great invention suddenly

arises, apparently bj' chance, but his coming wUl, in most cases, be found to have

' followed hard upon ' the discovery by some scientific worker of an important

fact, or even the accurate determination of a set of physical constants. No

--elaborate monograph need have reached the practical man a newspaper para-

graph, or a lecture at a Mechanics' Institute may have been sufficient to give

him the necessary impulse ; but the possessors of minds which are essentially

practical often forget how valuable to them have been the fragments of knowledge

they have so insensibly acquired that they are almost unconscious of having

received any external aid.

The investigating and the industrial faculty are sometimes, though rarely,

united in one individual. Rapid advance is often made by those who are un-

trammelled by a burden of precedent, but it should be remembered that though the

few successes, which have been attained in the course of ignorant practice, may

come into prominence, none of the countless failures are seen.

I would briefly direct attention to certain processes which have been adopted

since the year 1849, when Dr. Percy presided over this Section at Birmingham,

a great metallurgical centre. In that year the President of the Association

made a reference to metallurgy, a verj' brief one, for Dr. llobinson only said ' Ihe

manufacture of iron has been augmented si.x-fold by the use of the puddling-furnace

and the hot-blast, both gifts of theory ; and so, it may be added, are most of the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  '

important processes which have since been devised. Take the greatest metallurgical

advance of all, the Bessemer process, which has probably done more than any

other to promote the material advance of all countries. It was first communicated

to the world at the Oheltenliam Meeting of the British Association, 1856. Its
nature is well known, and I need only say that it depends on the fact that when

air is blown through a bath of impure molten iron, sufficient heat is evolved by the

rapid combustion of silicon, manganese, and carbon to maintain the bath fluid

after these elements have been eliminated, there being no external source of heat,

Weas there is in the puddling furnace or the refinery hearth.   have recently

been told that at an early and perilous stage of the Bessemer process confidence in

the experiments was restored by the obser%'atiou that the temperature of the

' blown ' metal contained in a crucible was higher than that of the furnace in which
it was placed. The historian of the future will not fail to record that the way for

the Bessemer process had been prepared by the theoretical work of Andrews, 1848,

and of Favre and Silbermann, 1852, whose work on the calorific power of various

elements showed that siUcon and phosphorus might be utilised as fuel, because

great heat is engendered by their combustion.

The basic process for removing phosphorus, a process of great national import-

ance, the development of which we owe to Thomas and Gilchrist, is entirely the

outcome of purely theoretical teaching, in connection with which the names of

Gruner and Percy deserve special mention. In the other great group of processes

for the production of steel, those in which Siemens' regenerative furnace is em-
ployed, we have the direct influence of a highly trained theorist, who concluded

his address as President of this Association in 1882 by reminding us that ' in the

great workshop of nature there is no line of demarcation to be drawn between the

most exalted speculation and commonplace practice.' The recent introduction of
TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION B.  595

the method of heating by radiation is, of course, the result of purely theoretical

considerations.

     The progress in the methods of extracting the precious metals has heen very
great, both on the chemical and engineering sides, but it is curious that in the

--metallurgy of gold and silver many ancient processes survive which were arrived

at empirically, a noteworthy exception being presented by the chlorine process
for refining gold, by the aid of which many millions sterling of gold have been
purified. The late Mr. H. B. Miller based this process for separating silver from
gold on the knowledge of the fact that chloride of gold cannot exist at a bright
red heat. The tension of dissociation of chloride of gold is high, but the precious
metal is not carried forward by the gaseous stream, at least not while chloride of

silver is being formed.

     The influence of scientific investigation is, however, more evident in that por-
tion of the metallurgic art which deals with the adaptation of metals for use, rather

than with their actual extraction from the ores.
     Only sixteen years ago Sir Nathaniel Barnaby, then Director of Naval Construc-

tion, wrote, ' our distrust of steel is so great that the material may be said to he
altogether unused by private ship-builders .... and marine engineers appear to
be equally afraid of it.' He adds, ' the question we have to put to the steel makers
is, what are our prospects of obtaining a material which we can use without such
delicate manipulation and so much fear and trembling ? ' All this is changed, for,
as Mr. Elgar informs me, in the year ending on June 30 last, no less than 401

ships, of three quarters of a million gross tonnage, were being built of steel in the
United Kingdom.

    Why is it, then, that steel has become the material on which we rely for our

ships and for our national defence, and of which such a splendid structure as the
Forth Bridge is constructed ? It is because side by side with great improvement
in the quality of certain varieties of steel, which is the result of using the open-
hearth process, elaborate researches have shown what is the most suitable

mechanical and thermal treatment for the metal ; but the adaptation of steel for

industrial use is only typical, as the interest in this branch of metallurgy gene-

rally appears for the moment to be centred in the question whether metals can, like
many metalloids, pass under the application of heat or mechanical stress from a
normal state to an allotropic one, or whether metals may even exist in numerous

isomeric states.

     It is impossible to deal historically with the subject now further than by stating
that the belief in more than one ' modification ' is old and widespread, and was ex-
pressed by Paracelsus, who thought that copper 'contains in itself its female,'
which could be isolated so as to give ' two metals '....' difierent in their
fusion and malleability' as steel and iron difier. Within the last few years
Schiitzenberger has shown that two modifications of copper can exist, the normal

one having a density of 8'95, while that of the allotropic modification is only 8'0,
and is moreover rapidly attacked by dilute nitric acid which is without action on

ordinary copper. It may be added that Lord Eayleigh's plea for the investigation
 of the simpler chemical reactions has been partly met, in the case of copper, by
the experiments conducted by V. H. Veley on the conditions of chemical change

 between nitric acid and certain metals.
      Bergmann, 1781, actually calls iron polymorphous, and says that it plays the

 part of many metals. ' Adeo ut jure dici queat polymorphum ferrum plurium
 simul metallorum vices sustinere.' Osmond has recently demonstrated the fact
 that at least two modifications of iron must exist.

       Professor Spring, of Liege, has given evidence that in cooling lead-tin alloys

 polymerisation may take place after the alloys have become solid, and it seems to

 be admitted that the same cause underlies both polymerisation and allotropy.
 The phenomenon of allotropy is dependent upon the number of tlie atoms in
 each molecule, but we are at present far from being able to say what degree of
 importance is to be attached to the relative distance between the atoms of a metal
 or to the ' position of one and the same atom ' in a metallic molecule, whether
 the metal be alloyed or free ; and it must be admitted that in this respect organic

                                                                                                                            QQ2

chemistry is far in advance of metallurgic chemistry. I cannot, as yet, state what

is the atomic grouping in the brilliantly-coloured gold-aluminium alloy, AuAl^,
which I have had the good fortune to discover, but, in it, the gold is probably

present in the same state as that in which it occurs in the purple of cassius.

Much valuable information on the important question of allotropy in metals has

already been gathered by Pionchon, Ditte, Moissan, Le Chatelier, and Osmond,
but reference can only be made to the work of the two latter. Le Chatelier con-

cludes that in metals which do not undergo molecular transformation the electrical

resistance increases proportionally to the temperature. The same law holds good

for other metals at temperatures above that at which their last change takes place,

for example in the case of nickel above 340°, and in that of iron above 850°.

It is probable that minute quantities of foreign matter which profoundly modify

the structure of masses of metal also induce allotropic changes. In the case of

the remarkable action of impurities upon pure gold I have suggested that the
modifications which are produced may have direct connection with the periodic

law of Mendel^eff, and that the causes of the specific vaiiations in the properties
of iron and steel may thus be explained. Tlie question is of great industrial im-

portance, especially in the case of iron ; and Osmond, whose excellent work I have
already brought before the members of this Association in a lecture delivered at

Newcastle in 188'J, has specially studied the influence upon iron exerted by certain

elements, lie shows that elements whose atomic volumes are smaller than that

of iron delay, during the cooling of a mass of iron from a red heat, the change of

the /3, or hard variety of iron, to the a, or soft variety. On the other hand,

elements whose atomic volumes are greater than that of iron tend to hasten the

change of /3 to a iron. It is, however, unnecessary to dwell upon this subject, as

it was dealt with last }-ear in the Address of the President of the Association.

It may be added that the recent use of nickel-steel for armour plate and the

advocacy of the use of copper-steel for certain purposes, is the industrial justifica-

tion of my own views as to the influence of the atomic volume of an added element

on the mechanical properties of iron, and it is remarkable that the two bodies, silicon

and aluminium, the properties of which when in a free state are so totally different,

shotild, nevertheless, when they are alloyed with iron, afl'ect it in the same way.

Silicon and aluminium have almost the same atomic volumes.

The consequences of allotropic changes which result in alteration of structure

are very great. The case of the tin regimental buttons which fell into a shapeless

heap w'hen exposed to the rigorous winter at St. Petersburg is well known. The

recent remarkable discovery by Ilopkinson of the changes in the density of nickel-

steel (couiainiug 22 per cent, of nickel) which are produced hy cooling to --30°,

affords another instance. This variety of steel, after being frozen, is readily

magnetizable, although it was not so before ; its density, moreover, is permanently
reduced by no less than 2 per cent, by the exposure to cold ; and it is startling to

contemplate the effect which would be produced by a visit to the arctic regions of

a ship of war built in a temperate climate of ordinarj' steel and clad with some

three thousand tons of such nickel-steel armour ; the shearing which would result
from the expansion of the armour by exposure to cold would destroy the ship.

Experimental compound armour-plates have been made faced with 25 per cent,

nickel-steel, but it remains to be seen w^hether a siinilar though lessened efl'ect

would be produced on the steel containing 5 to 7 per cent, of nickel, specially

studied by J. Riley, the use of which is warml}' advocated for defensive purposes.

Further information as to the molecular condition of nickel-steel has w'ithin the

last few weeks been given by Mercadier, who has shown that alloying iron with

25 per cent, of nickel renders the metal isotropic.

    The molecular behaviour of alloys is indeed most interesting. W. Spring has-

shown, in a long series of investigations, that alloys may be formed at the ordinary

temperature, provided that minute particles of the constituent metals are submitted

W.to great pressure.  Ilailock has recently given strong evidence in favour of

the view that an alloy can be produced from its constituent metals with but slight

pressure if the temperature to which the mass is submitted be above the melting-

point of the alloy, even though it be far below the melting-point of the most easily

Afusible constituent.  furlher instance is tlius afforded of the fact that a variation

of either temperature or pressure will eifect the union of solids. It may be added

that B. C. Damien is attempting: to determine what variation in the melting-point

of alloys is produced by fusing- them under a pressure of two hundred atmospheres.

Italian physicists are also working on the compressibility of metals, and F. Boggio-

Lera has recently established the existence of an interesting relation between the

coefficient of cubic compressibility, the specific gravity, and the atomic weight of

metals.

Few questions are more important than the measurement of very high tempera-

tures. Within the last few years II. le Chatelier has given us a thermo-couple of

platinum with platinum containing 10 per cent, of rhodium, by the aid of which

the problem of the measurement of high temperatures has been greatly simplified.

A trustworthy pyrometer is now at hand for daily use in works, and the liberality

of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers has enabled me to conduct an investi-

gation which has resulted iu the adoption of a simple appliance for obtaining, in

Athe form of curves, photographic records of the cooling of masses of metal.

report on the subject has already been submitted to a Committee, of which the

Director-General of Ordnance Factories is the Chairman ; and Dr. Anderson, to

whom I am indebted for valuable assistance and advice, intends to add this new

method for obtaining autographic curves of pyrometric measurements to the

numerous self-recording appliances used in the (rovernment factories which he

controls. It has proved to be easy to ascertain, by the aid of this pyrometer,

what thermal changes take place during the cooling of molten masses of alloys,

and it is possible to compare the rate of cooling of a white-hot steel ingot at defi-

nite positions situated respectively near its surface and at its centre, and thus to

solve a problem which has hitherto been considered to be beyond the range of

ordinary experimental methods. Some of the curves already obtained are of much

interest, and will be submitted to the .Section. It is probable that the form of the

curve which represents the solidification and cooling of a mass of molten metal

aflbrds an exceedingly delicate indication as to its purity.

Prof II. E. Armstrong holds that the molecules of a metal can unite to form

complexes with powers of coherence which vary with the presence of impurity,

Crookes, by a recent beautiful investigation, has taught us how electrical evapora-

tion of solid metals maybe set up in vacuo, and has shown that even an alloy may

Webe decomposed by such means.  may hope that such work will enable us to

understand the principles on which the strength of materials depends.

Before leaving the consideration of questions connected with the molecular

constitution of metals, I would specially refer to the excellent work of Ileycock

and Neville, who have extended to certain metals with low melting-points Raoult's

investigations on the effect of impurity on the lowering of the freezing-point of

solids. With the aid of one of my own students, H. C. Jenkins, I have further

extended the experiments by studying the effect of impurity on the freezing-point

of gold. Ramsay, by adoptinfj: Raoult's vapour-pressure method, has been led to

the conclusion that when in solution in mercury the atom of a metal is, as a rule,

identical with its molecule. The important research on the liquation of alloys has

been extended by E. ]\Iattbey to the platinum-gold and palladium-gold series, in

which the manipulation presented many difficulties ; and E..I. Ball has .studied the
cases presented by the antimony-copper-lead series. Dr. Alder Wright has con-

tinued his own important investigation upon ternary alloys, and A. P. Laurie has

worked on the electro-motive force of the copper-zinc and copper-tin and gold-tin

series, a field of research which promises fruitful results.

In no direction is advance more marked than in the mechanical testing of

metals, in which branch of investigation this country, guided hy Kirkaldy, un-
doubtedly took the leadins* part, and in connection with which Kennedy and Unwin
have established world-wide reputations. I would also specially mention the work

which has been carried on at the Government testing works at Berlin under Dr.
Wedding, and the elaborate investigations conducted at the Watertown Arsenal,

Massachusetts, not to mention the numerous continental testing laboratories directed

by siicli men as Bauschinger, Jenny, and Tetmajer. Perliaps tbe most important
recent work is that described by Prof. Martens, of Berlin, on the influence of heat

on the strength of iron.

     I might have dwelt at length on all these matters without doing half the
service to metallurgy that I hope to render by earnestly pleading for the more
extended teaching of the subject throughout the country, and for better laboratories,
arranged on the model of engineering laboratories, in which the teaching is con-
ducted with tbe aid of complete, though small, ' plant.' The Science and Art
Department has done great and lasting service by directing that metallurgy shall
be taught practically, but much remains to be done. With regard to laboratories
in works, which are too often mere sheds, placed, saj', behind tbe boiler-house, wben

may we hope to rival the German chemical firm which has recently spent 19,000/.

upon its laboratories, in which research will be vigorously conducted ? There is
hardly any branch of inorganic chemistry which the metallurgist can afford to
neglect, while many branches both of physics and mechanics are of utmost
importance to him.

     The wide range of study upon which a metallurgical student is rightly expected

to enter is leading, it is to be feared, to diminution in the time devoted to analytical
chemistry, and this most serious question sliould be pressed upon the attention of

all who are responsible for the training of our future chemists. There can be no

question that sufficient importance is not attached to the estimation of ' traces,' an
analysis being considered to be satisfactory if the constituents found add up to

99'!), although a knowledge as to what elements represent the missing O'l may be
more useful in affording an explanation of the defects in a material than all the
rest of the analysis. This matter is of growing interest to practical men, and may
explain their marked preference for chemists who have been trained in works, to
those who have been educated in a college laboratory.

     The necessity for affording public instruction in mining and metallurgy, with a
view to the full development of the mineral wealth of a nation, is well known.
The issues at stake are so vast, that in this country it was considered desirable to
provide a centre of instruction in which the teaching of mining and metallurgy
should not be left to private enterprise or even entrusted to a corporation, but
should be under the direct control of tbe Government. With this end in view, the
Boyal School of Mines was fovmded in 1851, and has supplied a body of well-
trained men who have done excellent service for the country and her colonies.
The Government has recently taken a step in advance, and has further recognised
 the national importance of the teaching of mining and metallurgy by directing that
 the School of Mines shall be incorporated with the Royal College of Science,
 which is, 1 believe, destined to lead tbe scientific education of tbe nation.

       It is to be feared that as regards metalliferous mining, other tlian that relating
 to iron, our country has seen its best days, but tbe extraordinary mineral wealth

of our colonies has recently been admirably described by my colleague. Professor

 Le Neve Foster, in the inaugural lecture he delivered early in the present year

Weon his appointment to the chair so long held by Sir Warington Smyth.

 shall, however, be able to rightly estimate tbe value of our birthright when tbe
 Imperial Institute is opened next year, and tbe nation will have reason to be
 grateful to Sir Frederick Abel for the care be is devoting to tbe development of
 this great institution, which will become the visible exponent of the splendours
 of our Indian and colonial resources, as well as a centre of information.

      Tbe rapid growth of technical literature renders it unnecessary for a president of
 a Section to devote his address to recording the progress of the subject be represents.
 As regards the most important part of our national metallurgy, this has, moreover,
 been admirably done by successive Presidents of tbe Iron and Steel Institute, but
 it may have been expected that references would have been mnde to the main pro-
 cesses which have been adopted since Percy occupied this chair in 1849. I have
 not done so, because an enumeration of tbe processes would have been wholly in-

 adequate, and a description of them impossible in the time at my disposal. Never-
 theless, it may be well to remind the Section of a few of the more prominent
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.                                                         599

additions tlie art has received in the Last lialf century, and to offer a few statements

to show the magnitude on which operations are conducted. As regards iron, in
the last twenty- five years the price of steel has been reduced from 55^. per ton to 51.
per ton, but, after giving- the world the inestimable boon of cheap steel by the
labours of Bessemer and of Siemens, we were somewhat slow to accept the teaching
of experiment as to the best method of treating the new material ; on the other
hand, Hadfield has brought manganese steel and aluminium steel within the reach

of the manufacturer, and J. Eiley has done much to develop the use of nickel steel.
In the case of copper, we have mainly contributed to extraordinary development
of wet processes for its extraction from poor sulphides, and have met the great

demands for pure metal by the wide adoption of electrolytic processes.

As regards the precious metals, this country is well to the front, for Great
Britain and her colonies produce about 38 per cent, of the gold supply of the world

and it may be well to add, as an indication of the scale on which operations are

conducted", that in London alone one ton of gold and five tons of silver bullion
                                                                                   method
can easily be refined in a day.  No pains  have been spared in     perfecting the  twenty
of assay by which the value of
                                 gold and  silver is ascertained,  and during my

years' connection with the Royal Mint I have been responsible for the accuracy

of the standard fineness of no less than five hundred and fifty-five tons of gold
coin, of an aggregate value of seventy millions five hundred thousand pounds

sterl'mg. In the case of the platinum industry we owe its extraordinary development

to the'skill and enterprise of successive members of the firm of Johnson, Matthey,
& Co., who in later years have based their operarions upon the results of the in-
vestigations of Devilie and Debrav. Some indication of the value of the material
dealt with may be gathered from the statement that two and a half hundredweight
of platinum may easily be melted in a single charge, and that the firm, in one

operation, extracted a mass of palladium valued at 30,000L from gold-platinum ore

actually worth more than a million sterling.
    I wish it were possible to record the services of those who have advanced

metallurgy in connection with this Association, but the limitations of_ time render

it difficult to do more than refer to some honoured names of past presidents of this

Section. Michael Faraday, president of this Section in 1837 and 1846, pi;epared
the first specimen of nickel-steel, an alloy which seems to have so promising a

mfuture, but we may hardly claim him as a metallurgist ; nor should I be justified

referring, in connection with metallurgical research, to my own master, Graham,

president of this Section in 1839, and again in 1844, were it not that his experiments
on the occlusion of gases by metals have proved to be of such extraordinary prac-
tical importance in connection with the metallurgy of iron. Sir Lyon Playfair

mpresided over this Section in 1855, and again in 1859. His work connection
mwith Bunsen on the composition of blast-furnace gases was published the Report

of this Association in 1847, and formed the eariiest of a group of researches,
amongst which those of Sir Lowthian Bell proved to be of so much importance, ihe
latter was President of this Section in 1889. Sir F. Abel, President of this Section
in 1877, rendered enduring service to the Government by his elaborate metal-
lurgical investigations, in connection with materials used for guns and proiectiles,
 as well as for defensive purposes. I will conclude this section of the address by

a tribute to the memory of Percy. He may be said to have created the English
literature of metallurgy, to have enriched it with the records of his own observa-

 tions, and to have revived the love of our countrymen for metallurgical investiga-
 tion. His valuable collection of specimens, made while Professor at the Royal

 School of Mines, is now appropriately lodged at South Kensington, and will
 form a lasting memorial of his labours as a teacher. He exerted very note-

 worthy influence in guiding the public to a just appreciation of the labours of
 scientific men, and he lived to see an entire change in the tone of the public
 press in this respect. In the year of Percy's presidency over this Section the

 ' Times ' gave only one-tenth of a column to a summary of the results of the last
 day but one of the Meeting, although the usual discourse delivered on the previous
 evening had been devoted to a question of great importance--'The application

of Iron to Railway purposes.' Space was, however, found for the interesting state-

iiient that tbe ' number of Quakeresses who attended the meetin£rs of the Sections
·was not a little remnrkable.' Compare the slender record of the ' Times ' of 1849

with its careful chronicle of the proceedings at any recent meeting of the
Association.

    In drawing this address to a close, I would point to the great importance of

extending the use of the less known metals. Attention is at present concentrated

on the production of aluminium, and reference has already been made to the

Cowles process, in which, as in that of Ileroult, the reduction of alumina is effected

by  carbon, at                                           the very high temperature of   the  electric  arc                 while,  on the  other
                                                                                                                        ;

hand, in the Kleiner and similar processes, the electric current acts less as a source

of heat than by decomposing a fluid bath, the aluminium being isolated by electro-

lytic action ; and doubtless, in the immediate future, there will be a rapid increase

in the number of metallurgical processes that depend on reactions which are set up

by submitting chemical systems to electric stress. Incidental reference should be

made to the growing importance of sodium, not only in cheapening the production

of aluminium, but as a powerful weapon of research. In 1849, when Percy was

president of this Section, magnesium was a curiosity ; now its production consti-

Wetutes a considerable industry.                                            may confidently expect to see barium and

calcium produced on a large scale as soon as their utility has been demonstrated by

research. Minerals containing molybdenum are not rare and the metal could
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

probably be produced as cheaply as tin if a use were to be found for it. The

quantities of vanadium and thallium which are available are also far from incon-

siderable                                           but  we, as  yet, know  little  of  the  action of any of these metals when
                                                 ;

alloyed with others which are in daily use. The field for investigation is vast

indeed, for it must be remembered that valuable qualities may be conferred on a

mass of metal by a very small quantity of another element. The useful qualities

Aimparted to platinum by iridium are well known.                                                                           small quantity of

tellurium obliterates the crystalline structure of bismuth but we have lost an
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

ancient art, which enabled brittle antimony to be cast into useful vessels. Two-

tenths per cent, of zirconium increases the strength of gold enormously, while the

same amount of bismuth reduces the tenacity to a very low point. Chromium,

cobalt, tungsten, titanium, cadmium, zirconium, and lithium are already well

known in the arts, and the valuable properties which metallic chromium and

tungsten confer upon steel are beginning to be generally recognised, as the last

Exhibition at Paris abundantly showed ; but as isolated metals we know but

little of them. Is the development of the I'arer metals to be left to other

countries ? Means for the prosecution of research are forthcoming, and a rich

reward awaits the labours of chemists who could bring themselves to divert their

attention, for even a brief period, from the investigation of organic compounds,

in order to raise alloys from the obscurity in which they are at present left.

    It must not be forgotten that metallurgical enterprise rests on (1) scientific know-

ledge, (2) capital, and (.3) labour, and that if the results of industrial operations are

to prove remunerative, much mu.st depend on the relation of these three elements,

Athough it is difficult to determine accurately their relative importance.                                                         modern

ironworks may have an army of ten thousand workmen, and commercial success or

failure will depend in no small measure on the method adopted in organising the

labour. The relations between capital and labour are of so much interest at the

present time that I do not liesitate to ofler a few words on the subject.

    Many examples might be borrowed from metallurgical enterprises in this and

other countries to show that their nature is often precarious, and that failure is easily

induced by what appear to be comparatively slight causes. Capitalists might

consequently tend to select Government securities for investment in preference to

metallurgical works, and the labouring population would then severely suffer. It is

only reasonable, therefore, that if capitalists are exposed to great risks, they should,

in the event of success, receive the greater part of the profits. There is a widespread

feeling that the interests of capital and labour must be antagonistic, and as it is

impossible to ignore the fact that the conflict between them is giving rise to grave
                     TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.                              601

apprehension, it becomes the duty of all who possess influence to strive not

merely for peace, but to range themselves on the side of justice and humanity. The

great labour question cannot be solved except hj assuming as a principle that

private ownership must be held inviolable, but it must be admitted that there was

a time when capital had become arbitrary and some kind of united action on the
part of workmen was needed in self-defence. If, however, we turn to the action

of the leaders of trades unions in the recent lamentable strikes, we ai-e presented

with a picture which many of us can only view as that of tyranny of the most

close and oppressive kind, in which individual freedom cannot even be recog'nised.

There are hundreds of owners of works who long to devote themselves to the true

welfare of those they employ, but who can do little against the influence of the

professional agitator, and are merely saddened by contact with prejudice and igno-

rance. I believe the view to be correct that some system by which the workman

participates in the profits of enterprise will afford the most hope of putting an end

to labour disputes, and we are told that profit-sharing tends to destroy the work-

man's sense of social exclusion from the capitalistic board, and contents him by

elevating him from the precarious position of a hired labourer. No pains should

therefore be spared in perfecting a system of profit-sharing.

Pensions for long service are great aids to patience and fidelity, and very much

may be hoped from the fact that strenuous etlbrts are being made by men really

competent to lead. The report of the Labour Commission which is now sitting

will be looked for with keen interest. Watchful care over the health, interests,

and instruction of the employed is exercised by many owners of works; and in this

respect the Dowlais Works, which are being transplanted into your midst at

Cardiff", have long presented a noteworthy example. Workmen must not forget

that the choice of their own leaders is in their own hands, and on this the future

Wemainly depends. '  may lay it down as a perpetual law that workmen's associa-

tions should be so organised and governed as to furnish the best and most suitable

means for attaining what is aimed at, that is to say, for helping each individual

member to better his condition to the utmost in body, mind, and property.' The

words will be found in the Encyclical letter which Pope Leo XIII. has recently

issued on the 'Condition of Labour.' To me it is specially interesting that the

Bishop of Rome in his forcible appeal again and again cites the opinion of St.

Thomas Aquinas, who was a learned chemist as well as a theologian.

Those of us who realise that ' the higher mysteries of being, if penetrable at all

by human intellect, require other weapons than those of calculation and experiment,'

should be fully sensible of our individual responsibility. Seeing that the study of the

relations between capital and labour involve the consideration of the complex

problems of existence, the solution of which is at present hidden from us, we shall

feel with Andrew Lang that ' where, as matter of science, we know nothing, we

can only utter the message of our temperament.' My own leads me to hope that

the patriotism of the workmen will prevent them from driving our national
industries from these shores, and I would ask those to whom the direction of the
metallurgical works of this country is confided, to remember that we have to
deal both with metals and with men, and have reason to be grateful to all who

extend the boundaries, not only of our knowledge, but also of our sympathy.

   2. The Spontaneous Ignition of Coal. J3(/ Professor YiviAN B. Lewes.
     Ever since Berzelius first suggested that the heat evolved by the oxidation of

the pyrites in coal might have an important bearing on spontaneous ignition, it
has been adopted as the popular explanation of that phenomenon, and although
the researches of Richter and others have gone far to disprove it, this theory is the
generally accepted one. It can be shown, however, that the coals most liable to
spontaneous ignition often contain as little as 0'8 per cent, of pyrites, and rarely more
than 2 per cent., and if this amount were concentrated in one spot, instead of being
spread over a very large mass, and if it were entirely oxidised with the greatest
rapidity, instead of taking months and often years to complete the action, the total
rise of temperature would be totally inadequate to account for ignition of the coal,
which requires a temperature of 370° C. to 477° C, according to its characteristics.
The liability to spontaneous ignition also does not increase with percentage of
pyrites, whilst heaps of pure pyrites free from carbonaceous matter never show any
tendency to serious heating.

     The true explanation of the ignition of coal is partly physical and partly che-
mical. Freshly won coal has the power of absorbing from 1'.5 to 3 times its volume
of oxygen from the air, and this being rendered chemically highly active, partly
by compression and partly by elimination of nitrogen, attacks some of the bitu-
minous hydrocarbons in the coal, converting them into carbon dioxide and water
vapour. Many causes tend to aifect the rapidity of this action, which is the real
source of the heat, and directly the temperature begins to rise, unless the heat
evolved can freely diifuse itself, the chemical action is so energetic that ignition

quickly follows. Up to 38° C. the absorption of oxygen, and consequent chemical

action, goes on so slowly that there is little or no chance of undue heating ; but
directly this temperature is exceeded, with some classes of coal ignition is only a
question of time and mass. The action of mass, condition, and temperature can be
beautifully traced in the statistics of spontaneous ignition in coal cargoes, whilst

the bunker fires, which are now becoming perilously frequent on the fast liners, are

due entirely to rise in temperature from the bunker bulkheads being too close to
the hot air up-cast shafts from the boilers and furnaces.

investigation on whic)- lie was engaged with his assistants, Dr. Carl Langer and

Dr. Frfedrich Quincke, into the remarkable property of metallic nickel to induce,

at the comparatively low temperature of 350° C, the complete dissociation of car-

inw varying quantities of carbon up to 85 per cent. This mass takes fire on expo-

sure to airj^so that it had to be cooled with exclusion of air for the purpose of
analysis, which was done in a slow current of carbonic oxide gas. This gas was

subsequently led into a Bunsen burner, so as to keep it out of the atmosphere of

the room, 'in this wav it was observed that when the cooling had proceeded to a
certain point (about 150° C.) the Bunsen flame became luminous and remained so,

and even became intenser, down to ordinary atmospheric temperature. When the

gas before entering the burner was heated in a glass tube, a metallic mirror was

obtained, while the luminosity of the flame disappeared.

   At first this phenomenon was referred to the presence in the nickel of an

unknown element, perhaps to Kriiss and Schmidt's Gnomium, which at this time

still haunted chemical literature. The metal of the mirror, however, gave all and

every one of the reactions of nickel with remarkable brilliancy, and an approximate

determination of the atomic weight came out so nearly to the very carefully

determined figure of Russel for-nickel (58-58 as compared with _58-74) that there

could be no doubt about its identity with our well-known old friend, whose cha-
racter as a simple body, called in question by Kriiss and Schmidt, was thus

rehabilitated.

   In repeating the experiment with carbonic oxide, quite free from hydrogen and

moisture, and only contaminated with nitrogen, the same result was obtained.

After removing the carbonic oxide by cuprous chloride and heating the residual

gas to 180° in aniline vapour, at which temperature nickel, quite free from carbon,

is separated, the volume of the gas expanded considerably, and the gas contained
only nitrogen and carbonic oxide. It was thus evident that a volatile compound

of nickel and carbonic oxide had been obtained, which, on heating, dissociated into

its constituents. The increase of volume proved that one volume of gas yielded
four volumes of carbonic oxide, and the determination of the amount of nickel

deposited and the carbonic oxide formed led to a proportion of four equivalents of
carbonic oxide to one of nickel. To further study the properties of this compound

it was necessary to produce larger quantities, which took a long time to accom-

plish. By preparing the nickel in a very fine state of division, at the lowest possi-

ble temperature, by "reducing the oxide, or, better still, the oxalate, in a current of

hydrogen at about 400° C, and by carefully purifying and regulating the current

of carbonic oxide, the compound was formed quite readily, and the gas passed

through a refrigerator, cooled by ice and salt, was condensed to a liquid.

   This liquid is colourless, mobile, highly refracting, possesses a characteristic

odour, and is very volatile. It is soluble in a large number of organic liquids,

such as alcohol, ether, chloroform, benzole, petroleum, tar oils, &c. It boils at

43° C. and 751 mm. pressure without decomposition, and evaporates rapidly at
ordinary temperatures in a current of other gases. The specific gravity is 1-3185

atl7°C.; at -25° it solidifies, forming needle-shaped crystals ; the pure vapoiir

explodes when suddenly heated to above '60°, and even when the tube containing it is
Ascratched roughly with a file.
                                          mixture of the vapour with air explodes violently

on the application of a flame. Both the liquid and the vapour are poisonous, the lat-

ter approximating carbonic oxide in this respect. According to an investigation

kindly undertaken by Professor McKendrick, the liquid dissolved in chloroform

produces, when injected subcutaneously in extremely small doses in rabbits, an

extraordinary reduction of temperature, amounting in some cases to 12° C.

   Careful determinations of the quantity of nickel contained in the liquid, made

by introducing a weighed quantity into chlorine water and precipitation of the

nickel from the resulting solution, led to figures agreeing very closely with the
--604 KEPORT 1891

formula Ni (C0)[, viz., 34'33 aud 34:-26 percent, of nickel, the formula requiring
34'2S. The vapour density determined hj' Victor Meyer's method at 50° was found
equal to 6'01 ; the formula Ni (CO)^ requires 5-S9.

     The compound is chemically very inactive generally speaking, it only reacts
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

with substances having a considerable affinity for nickel, such as the halogens, sul-
phur, oxygen, and oxidising substances, which combine with the nickel and liber-
ate carbonic oxide. Chlorine and bromine when used in excess also enter into
combination with the carbonic oxide. Sulphur in the dry state forms a sulphide
of nickel corresponding to the formula Ni.iSj, and dissolved in bi-sulphide of carbon
it forms a sulphide containing more sulphur, but of varying composition. Selenium
acts similarly but very slowly. Tellurium shows hardly anj' action. Metals (even
potassium) are not acted upon.

     Alkalies and acids (even strong hydrochloric acid) produce no change except
they are oxidising agents, such as nitric acid and aqua regia. With metallic salts
no reaction is obtained unless they have oxidising properties as hypochlorites,
which form a higher oxide of nickel, or which are capable of giving oiF sulphur, such
as hyposulphites and bisulphites.

     The author has tried in vain to substitute other bivalent groups for the carbonic
oxide in this compound, or to introduce the carbonic oxide by means of this
compound into organic substances. Experiments in this direction have covered a
very wide range and have included, amongst others, the following : hydroxylamine
hydrochloride, phenylhydrazin hydrochloride hydroxylamine, dichloracetic acid,
tetrabromphenolbromiJe, ethylinechloride, and aceto-acetic-ether, but in no single
instance was the desired result obtained.

     On exposure to moist or dry air a tlocculent substance, which varies in colour

 from a light green to a dark brown, is very slowly formed. This substance dis-
solves completely in dilute acids with evolution of carbonic acid ; numerous
 analyses have not led to a definite proportion between Ni and CO., in this com-
pound. On heating it to dull red heat it turns black. Professor Berthelot, in a

paper recently communicated to the French Academy of Sciences, assumes that
 this black colour is produced by the separation of carbon, and bases upon this an
argument that the compound is of a complex composition, and that the nickel car-
 bon oxide, on exposure to air, behaves like a real compound radical analogous to

 organo-metallic radicals. As, however, the black substance so obtained dissolves
 in dilute acids without leaving any residue, aud as an exactly similar black sub-
 stance is obtained by heating precipitated nickel carbonate, this argument does not
 seem to be conclusive, since Professor Berthelot has not substantiated so important
 a conclusion by a complete analysis of the black substance.

      Professor Berthelot describes in the same paper a very beautiful blue compound
 obtained by treating nickel carbon oxide with nitric oxide. Unfortunately he does
 not publish an analysis of this beautiful substance either, so that until he has done
 so we are unable to judge of its bearing on the constitution of nickel carbon oxide.

       AVith a view to elucidate this con.stitution the author has, in conjunction with
 Professor R. Nasini, of Eome, studied the physical properties of the liquid, more
 especially its refraction and dispersion. The details of this investigation have been
 communicated to the Accademia dei Lincei at Rome, and have also been published
 in the ' Journal fiir phj'sikalische Chemie.'

      The author has determined the freezing-point of a dilute solution in benzole
 containing 4'8991 per cent., and has found the coefficient of diminution '2776,
 corresponding to a molecular weight of 176'5 ; while nickel carbon oxide requires
 170-6. The mean cubical coefficient of expansion between 0° and 3G° C. is equal to
 ·001853, which is one of the highest coefficients of expansion yet found for any
 liquid, and is only slightly exceeded by ethylic ether, ethyl chloride, and silicium
 tetrachloride. The indices of refraction and the dispersion for the lines a, (3, and y
 of hydrogen, and for the lines of lithium, sodium, and thallium have been deter-
 mined at three different temperatures, and are found to be very high. The dis-
 persion is about the same as carbon disulphide. The refraction varies very much
 with the temperature, the amount of variation being very nearly equal to that of

 Dcarbon disulphide. The index of refraction for the line at 10° C. is 1-45843.
           TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  605

     According to Gladstone's formula this leads to the specific refraction of "3437

and the molecular refraction of 58'63. Under the supposition that the group CO

had the same value in this compound which results from the sum of the atomic re-

fraction of carhon and that of the divalent oxygen molecule in organic compounds,

which is the more probable, as the group GO shows ver}^ nearly the same molecular

refraction in compounds of the most different constitution, such as oxalic acid,

ketones, and carbonyldichloride, the atomic refraction of nickel would come out
equal to 2502. This figure is very much higher, nearly two and a half times as

high as it is in nickel salts, in which it has been found by Gladstone to be about

10 ; and about four times as high as the atomic refraction of metallic nickel as
determined by Kundt and Dubois and Rubens, viz., about 6.

This difference of the atomic refraction of nickel in this compound and in its

ordinary combinations is by far greater than that found in any other element.

According to the generally accepted view, such differences are due to the element

possessing a large number of valencies, and are proportional to the number of

valencies of each compound. Nickel is generally bivalent. Its very high atomic re-

fraction in nickel carbon oxide would thus lead to the conclusion that in this

compound the nickel exercises a considerably higher valency than two, and that
it has probably reached its maximum of saturation foreseen by Mendeleeff, who

placed this metal in the eighth group of his Periodic System, to be equal to

eight ; so that the constitution of our compound would be a simple combination of

one oetovalent equivalent of nickel with four bivalent equivalents of carbonic oxide,

or that of nickel tetracarbonyl.

    All that we definitely know of the chemical properties of the compound is in

accord with this view of its constitution.

   A determination of the magnetic rotary power of the compound kindly made

by Dr. W, H. Perkin has shown this to be quite as exceptional as its refraction,

and, with the exception of phosphorus, greater than any substance he has yet

examined.

Professor Quincke, of Heidelberg, has had the kindness to investigate the

magnetic properties of the liquid, lie found the constant of diamsignetism, at

1G° G., /fc= -3-131 X lO-io for magnetic fields of 6,000 to 14,000 G.G.S. units.

This is nearly the same as the constant for ethylic ether = -- 3'218 x 10~'°.

    The liquid is an exceptionally bad conductor of electricity. Up to 40 volts no

current was observed to pass, the electrodes of 1 sq. cm. area being 1 cm. apart.

The highly interestiug properties of nickel carbon oxide naturally led the

author to try whether he could not obtain similar compounds of other metals.

It seemed a foregone conclusion that cobalt, in every respect so much like nickel,

must give an analogous compound. It seemed probable that oth-^r metals of the

eighth group and those standing near to nickel in other groups would also

Acombine with carbonic oxide.  large number of elements were tried, including

osmium, palladium, ruthenium, rhodium, iridium, and manganese by acting upon

them in the finely divided state with carbonic oxide gas over a wide range of

temperature. The author tried it by double decomposition with numerous com-

pounds, including zinc ethyl and mercury methyl, but, with one sole and single

exception, without success.

This sole exception is iron. This metal, too, had for a long time given

negative results ; but by preparing it at the lowest possible temperature by

reduction of the oxalate in a current of hydrogen, and by acting upon this at

about 80° G. with a very slow current of very pure carbonic oxide, the author

succeeded at last, in conjunction with Dr. F. Quincke, in obtaining evidence that a
volatile compound of this element with carbonic oxide exists. The gas obtained

imparted a yellow tinge to a Bunsen flame and yielded slight metallic mirrors

composed of pure iron. The quantity of the iron compound in the gas was,
however, extremely small. By passing the gas through heavy tar oils, in which

the compound is soluble, but from which it cannot be separated by fractionation,

as on heating it decomposes the solution into iron and carbonic oxide before it

volatilises, and by determining the iron and carbonic oxide so obtained, it was

ascertained, as far as the very small quantities of the substance available would
--606
REPOET 1891.

allow, that it contained iron and carbonic oxide in the proportion of 1 equivalent
of iron to 4'126 of carbonic oxide, or very nearly 1 to 4.

      Since these results were communicated to the Chemical Society (J une 18,
1891) the author has continued the study of this bod}', in collaboratioii with
Dr. Carl Langer, and has obtained it as an amber-coloured liquid, which, on
standing, deposits tabular crystals of a darker colour, and solidifies entirely below

-- 21° C. to a mass of needle-shaped crystals. It boils at 102° C, but leaves a

small quantity of green-coloured oil behind.
     Several analyses and vapour density determinations have been made, but it is

not yet certain whether a pure substance is in hand or a mixture of several iron
carbonyls. The author hopes to be able very shortly to publish a full account
of this interesting substance, which differs considerably in its chemical behaviour
from nickel carbon oxide.

     The fact that under ordinary circumstances nickel alone is acted ou when
a mixture of this metal with any other metallic or mineral substances is treated
by carbonic oxide gas led the author to institute experiments to ascertain whether
it would not be possible by means of carbonic oxide to extract nickel direct from
its ores, and such metallurgical products as nickel speiss and nickel matte. As the
nickel is volatilised at the ordinarj' temperature in the form of a vapour dissemi-
nated through other gases from which it can be deposited without first condensing
the nickel compound by simply heating these gases to the moderate temperature of
200° C, as it is thus obtained in the form of bright coherent masses of great
purity, as the carbonic oxide used is completely liberated and can be employed
over and over again, and as small quantities of the poisonous nickel compound
which may escape decomposition would thus never leave the closed apparatus
in which the process would be carried out, it seemed probable that such a process
might be capable of industrial application, and might prove more economical than
the very complicated operations metallurgists have now to resort to to produce

tolerably pure nickel.
     Experiments carried out under the author's instructions by Dr. Langer with a

great variety of nickel ores from all parts of the world, containing from 4 to 40
per cent, of nickel, as well as a number of samples of nickel speiss and nickel
matte, have proved that as long as the nickel is combined with arsenic or sulphur

the process is entirely successful on a laboratory scale. In the majority of cases

the nickel has been extracted almost completely in three to four days.
     Such ores or matte or speiss have in, the first instance to be calcined, so as to

convert the nickel completely into oxide. The mass is then reduced in a current
of hydrogenous gases, in practice water-gas, at a temperature of 450° C. It is
cooled down to ordinary temperature and treated with carbonic oxide in a suitable
apparatus. For this purpose any good apparatus for treating solids by gases, of
which a great number are in common use, will answer. Methodical apparatus
moving the reduced ore in a direction opposite to the current of carbonic oxide, at
the same time exposing fresh surfaces, facilitates the operation. After a certain
time the action of the carbonic oxide upon the nickel becomes sluggish. The mass
is then heated to about 350° C. in a current of carbonic oxide, which regenerates
the activity of the nickel. This may be done in the same apparatus, but it is
preferable to use a separate apparatus connected with the first, and from which it
is returned to the first by mechanical means, so that each apparatus can be kept at
the same temperature. The carbonic oxide gas can be employed dilute, as it
is obtained from gas-producers ; but since it is contiuuousl}' recovered, a purer gas

such as can be cheaply prepared by passing carbonic acid through incandescent
coke is more advantageous, as it extracts the nickel more quickly and requires
smaller apparatus. The gas charged with the nickel compound leaving the
apparatus is passed through tubes or chambers heated to about 200° C, in which
the nickel is deposited. The gas leaving these tubes is returned to the first

apparatus and circulates continuously. From time to time the nickel is removed
from the tubes in which it has been deposited. To facilitate this operation thin
nickel sheets bent to fit the tubes are inserted, on which the nickel deposits, and
which are easily taken out. The metal so obtained is almost chemically pure;
                                      TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.                                        607

only very rarely in the case of certain ores it is slightly contaminated with iron.

Its density is equal to that of ordinary sheet nickel. Its mechanical properties

still await investigation.

    As the nickel is deposited in perfectly coherent films upon heated surfaces

exposed to the gas containing the nickel carbon oxide, the author finds it possible
to produce direct from such gas articles of solid nickel or goods plated with nickel

resembling in every way those obtained by galvanic deposition of metals, and

reproducing with the same exactitude and fineness any design upon such articles.

     This result can also be obtained by immersing heated articles in a solution
of nickel carbon oxide in such solvents as benzole, petroleum, tar oils, &c., or by
applying such solution to the heated articles with a brush or otherwise.

     These processes open up a wide perspective of useful application, considering
the many valuable properties of nickel, especially its power of resisting atmospheric
and other chemical influences.

                               By T. TuENER, A.B.S.M.

In those rolled copper alloys which are of a yellow colour it is common to find

surface stains of a copper colour. These stains render the rolled metal unfit for

many purposes. The cause of these stains has been much discussed, but no

definite eddence as to their origin has been forthcoming. Among the supposed

causes have been overheating during annealing, sulphur in the fuel used, the

presence of soot or ashes, irregularity in the alloy, and the use of an iron stirring-

rod. The author has conducted a number of experiments, and concludes that none

of these causes is responsible for the production of the stains observed, but that

the stains are merely on the surface, and are produced by dirt in some form or

other. The                            use of wash-water containing  chlorides, after  pickling, is  in  the

stannic chloride, gold chloride, and gold. The E.M.F. is found to rise abruptly on
passing from alloys containing 36 per cent, to those containing 38 per cent, of tin,
 thus indicating the existence of a compound of the formula AuSn. This agrees
with the maximum point in Matthiessen's conductivity curve for these alloys.
Some preliminary experiments with gold aluminium alloys show that there is a
rise in E.M.F. on passing over Professor Roberts-Austen's new purple alloy. This
method not only indicates the existence of a compound, but also enables us to cal-
culate approximately the heat of formation of the compound from the rise in
E.M.F. in passing from the alloys below to those above the compound.

3. On the delation between the Composition of a Double Salt and the Gom-
      position and Temperature of the Solution in ivhich it is formed. By
      A. Vernon Haucoort, F.B.S., and F. W. Humphery, of Christ

         Church, Oxford.

     The particular double salt of which the authors have prepared and analysed
some seventy specimens is ferrous and ammonium chloride. Probably many other

double salts, if similarly examined, would show similar variations. When ferrous
chloride and ammonium chloride are dissolved together in warm water, and the

saturated liquid is allowed to cool, white crystals are deposited, whose composition
varies with the proportion of the two salts in solution and with the temperature at
which the crystals are formed. Since the proportion of the two chlorides in the
liquid and in the crystals which form in the liquid is very diflerent, the compo-
sition of the liquid changes continually during crystallisation, and no two portions
of the double salt are formed under exactly the same conditions. In the authors'
later experiments the variation from the begianing to the. end of a crystallisation
was reduced to about 2 per cent, by taking a crop of crystals weighing only eight
or ten grams from a liquid containing some hundreds of gTams of each chloride.

By the use of a water-bath, in which the flask holding the solution was plunged,
warmed by a gas-burner which was govei-ned by a thermostat in the liquid, the

Ctemperature was kept at that point at which crystallisation began within 0°02

   --The general relations observed are as follows : The proportion of ammonium

chloride in the salt increases with that in the solution nearly in direct ratio for a

given temperature, the ratio varying from about thrice the proportion of ammonium
chloride in the salt that there is in the solution, at the highest temperature, up to
nearly six times the proportion at the lowest. The same solution j'ields crystals
containing more ferrous chloride at a higher temperature and less at a lower.
Solutions containing two or more molecules of ammonium chloride to one mole-

cule of ferrous chloride yield well-formed crystals, white and transparent, having

sides of one millimetre or more in length. When the salt contains twenty or thirty
molecules of ammonium chloride to one molecule of ferrous chloride the crystals are
as large as when the proportion of ammonium chloride is smaller. With less than
two molecules of ammonium chloride the crystals are apt to be very small and to
resemble those of ammonium chloride in form though not in composition.

     In most cases the composition of the crystals can be represented by a formula
Fe CI", JiH^NCl where n is integral. Salts have been analysed with closely con-

--cordant results in which n has the following values: 7, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17,

18, 19, 20, 23. But in some cases, where equal or greater care has been taken that
the conditions may not change during crystallisation, the values of n are not
integral. Also the double salt is hydrated ; the determination of the amount of
water presents greater diiliculties than the rest of the analysis, a temperature of
about 200° C. being necessary to expel the whole ; the results thus obtained, which
generally agree with the estimation of water by difference, frequently correspond
to 2'5 molecules of water for each molecule of ferrous chloride. Perhaps, there-
fore, the formulae of the double salts should be multiplied by two, or some larger
even number.

     The whole of the results obtained can be grouped together in a Table, in which
each salt is represented by the value of n and is assigned a position showing (1)
the composition, (2) the temperature, of the solution in which it was formed.

4. Some Experiments on the Molecular Refraction of Dissolved Electrolytes,

              By Dr. J. H. Gladstoxb, F.B.S.,and W. Hibbert.

     This was a preliminary notice of some experiments undertaken in the hope of
throwing some further light on the nature of electrolytes in solution, and especially
on the views advocated by Van t'Hoff, Ostwald, and Arrhenius.

    It was discovered many years ago that hydrochloric acid had an increased
molecular refraction when it was dissolved in water, and it has been more recently
observed that this increase has further augmented as the solution is made weaker.
It was now found that on raising the temperature 55° there is a distinct reduction
of the molecular refraction. This is scarcely what would be expected from an
increase of ionic dissociation. It would appear that chloride of lithium follows the
same law as hydrochloric acid in regard to the effect of dilution, but on raising the
temperature it was found that the molecular refraction was slightly increased in
strong solutions, but decidedly decreased in weak ones. Chloride of sodium shows
much the same molecular rel'ractionat different strengths and in different tempera-
tures. Sulphate of magnesium was examined as a salt of a different type, but it
closely resembled the sodium chloride. As the results obtained from these four

electrolytes were so diverse no general conclusions were drawn.

A6, Simple Apparatus for Storing Dry Gases. By W. Symons, F.C.S.

Requiring some dry carbonic acid gas and ammonia, with only very limited ap-
Apliances at hand, the author was at a loss how to store them.
                                                                  mercurial trough

was out of the question. Ordinary petroleum as sold in the oil shops suggested

itself. For this purpose a large wide-mouth bottle had inserted into its cork a

short delivery tube with a tap, and a metal funnel, with a long metal tube

reaching nearly to the bottom of the bottle, also with a tap below the funnel.

This is to supply the petroleum. To increase the pressure the tube should be long

Aenough above the bottle.  glass tube, open both ends, is inserted in the cork, as

large as it can be, say f-inch internal diameter, or more. This reaches to about

half an inch from the bottom of the bottle. AVith the cork well secured by

cement or varnish not acted on by petroleum, the bottle can be filled with petro-

Aleum through the funnel, both taps being open. When full they are closed.

glass siphon, with one end turned up and the other end a little enlarged to facili-

tate filling it with petroleum, is then inserted in the large tube, the finger being

kept on the' enlarged end so as to retain the petroleum while inserting it. If the

whole be air-tight no petroleum will escape, and this will test the gasholder.

Another tube, with the bottom turned, also fits into the large tube, and the bent

end must be kept outside it, in the bottom of the bottle, so as to deliver the gas

into the bottle. To the upper end of this tube is attached, by india-rubber

tubing, the gas-generating apparatus, but with a small Woulfe's bottle intervening

as a safely bottle to catch any petroleum which may be drawn over by any irregu-

larity in generating the gas. Of course, the gas must also be passed through a

drying apparatus. When sufficient gas has been collected, both tubes are with-
drawn, and the gas stored for use. When required, petroleum must be put in the

fuimel, and the supply regulated by the tap. If the gas is to be stored for some

time the siphon should remain in the gasholder, and the outer end of it be put into
a bottle partially filled with petroleum to provide for the expansion or contraction

of the gaa by variations of temperature or atmospheric pressure.

 4. On the Specific Heat of Basalt. By W. C. Roberts-Atjsten, C.B.,
                         F.R.S., and A. W. Rucker, F.R.8.

     Having been asked by the Rev. O. Fisher to determine for him the latent heat
of basalt, we made som.e experiments on a specimen which was furnished to us by
Professor Judd. Fragments of the rock were melted in a platinum crucible, the
junction of a thermal couple consisting of platinum with platinum containing
10 per cent, of rhodium was immersed in the pasty mass, which was then allowed
to cool. The scale of the galvanometer had previously been standardised by an
observation on the solidifying point of pure gold, and tliis was repeated from time

to time whilst the experiments were in progress. When the spot of light had

reached the desired point, the wires were nipped off close to the basalt, and the
crucible and its contents were plunged into 1,000 grammes of water contained in a
silver calorimeter. The water was stirred by a screw or fan of silver, which was
rotated by an electro-motor. The temperature was read by means of a mercurial
thermometer which had been carefully corrected.

      The two main sources of error in the experiments are probably an uncertainty
as to the mean temperature of the basaltic mass, O'wing to its being a bad con-
ductor of heat, and the fact that in the processes of heating and cooling, it
undergoes more or less important changes of constitution.

      The iirst error was reduced to small proportions by using small quantities ot
basalt, the most employed rarely much exceeding 20 grammes.

     The second error is iu part unavoidable ; the rapidly cooled basalt was always
glazed like olivine. AVe also found that frequent heatings and coolings, and the
 nature of the flame, whether oxidising or reducing, employed to heat the mass,
 appeared to atl'ect the results very seriously.

      In some experiments the crucible was heated in a small gas furnace, in others
 in a coke furnace. All the former were consistent with each other, and those of
 the latter group in which fresh specimens of basalt were used, were in agreement
 with them. The results obtained with specimens which had been heated two or
 more times in the coke furnace were, however, very irregular, and as we have not
 definitely proved what was the cause of these discrepancies, we publish our results
 with a certain amount of reserve. In the following table T is the temperature (Cent.)
 of the basalt at the moment of immersion, C is the mean specific heat between
 about 20° C. and T :--

                     T.
                              TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.           611
These results are plotted in the figure.

If Cj,2 be the mean specific heat between two temperatures t^ and t,,, we have

the relation

              - O -C,,3(^3
                                = C,.,(i, t,) + C,;{t,-t,-).

If then we take the mean specific heat from 20° C.

                      to          470° to be 0-199
                                  750° ,, 0-21G
                      ,,          880° ,, 0-278
                      ,,        1,190° ,, 0-290,

              and ,,

we get the following results :

The mean specific heat between

                                20° and 470° is 0'199

              470° ,,           750° ,, -243

              750° ,,           880° ,, -62G

              880° ,, 1,190° ,, -323.

    As Mr. Fisher was anxious to use our results in some calculations, we supplied
him with approximate numbers before all our observations were completed. They
do not, however, differ much from the above.

     The general result seems to be that the specific heat of basalt follows the

ordinary rule that the specific heat of a substance is greater in the liquid than in
the solid state. There is a large absorption of heat in the neighbourhood of 800°,

which raises the mean specific heat between 750° and 880° to the large value

of 0-626.

                      C. On Didijmium from different Sources.
                        By Professor C. M." Thompson, F.G.S.

     According to Kiesewetter and Kriiss (Berichte, xxi., 2,313), a solution of the
earths from Yttrotitanite from Arendal shows only three bands due to didymium.
On examining a moderately concentrated solution after separation from the bulk
of the other metals by precipitation with potassium sulphate, all the bands
shown by an ordinary didymium solution of similar strength were seen.

    Specimens of didymium from Gadolinite, from Orthite, and from Monazite were

also examined. No differences as compared with didymium from cerite could be

observed sufficiently marked to justify the inference that the bands varied in
strength in an independent manner.

9. Action of Nitrosyl Chloride on Unsaturated Carion Compounds.
              By J. J. SuDBOROUGH, B.Sc, A.I.C., F.C.S.

The author, after mentioning the work done by Tilden with regard to the

action of nitrosyl chloride on phenol and on the terpenes/ and also that of Tonnies

on the action of the same reagent on amylene and anethol/ gave a brief account of

experiments, conducted bj- himself, on the action of nitrosyl chloride on the follow-

ing substances : ethylene, propylene, amylene, cinnamene ; crotonic, oleic, erucic,

and cinnamic acids. Of these ethylene is chlorinated and forms the dichloride

CjH^Cl,,                                   propylene is practically unacted upon ;  amylene forms a nitroso-chloride,
                                        ;

CjHipNOCl, melting at 152°; and cinnamene, a similar compound, OgHgNOCl,

melting at 97°. Crotonic acid is unacted upon even when heated to 90°, while

oleic and erucic acids readily form definite nitroso-chlorides, the former melting at

86° and the latter at 92°. Cinnamic acid is unacted upon when cooled, but forms

the dichloride C,,Hp,,Cl.j when heated to 100°.

    The nitroso-chlorides are best prepared by dissolving the substance in chloroform,
cooling to -- 1 0°, and then passing the nitrosyl chloride in until there is a strong

smell of it. The chloroform is then evaporated ofl', and the nitroso-chloride recrys-

tallised from alcohol or chloroform.

These nitroso-chlorides are not merely molecular compounds, but definite and

stable bodies undecomposed by alcohol or water.

Up to the present the author can find no laws regulating the action of nitrosyl

chloride on various carbon compounds, but he hopes to continue the work at some

future date with that object in view.

10. On the Formation of Peaty Colouring Matters in Seivage hy the Action
      of Micro-organisms. By W. E. Adeney, F.I.C, Assoc.EuC.Sc.I.,

       Curator, Royal University of Ireland. (Preliminary Notice.)

     The author gave a preliminary description of some experiments showing that
when sewage is treated with a plentiful supply of nitre, and kept out of contact
with fresh air, the soluble organic fermentable matters in it are completely
destroyed by the influence of micro-organisms, without undergoing any inter-
mediate stage of putrefaction, and that a liquid is finally obtained deeply coloured
with a brown colouring matter, having similar properties to the colouring matters
in natural peaty waters. The author also showed that the liquid, after the micro-
organisms have died down, probably contains no organic matter save the colouring
matter referred to.

     11. On a new Method of Disposal of Seivage, with some references to
                     Schemes now in use. By 0. Gr. MoOR, B.A.

      This paper is divided into three headings.

     The first gives the titles and objects of a few of the best known schemes,
with some very short remarks as to how far their aims are accomplished.

     The second part deals with the method of utilisation of sludge, which the

author has experimented on. He mentioned the important fact that the yield of
ammonia amply pays the cost of this part of the process.

obtain knowledge as to the best means of precipitation, with a view to subsequent

utilisation.

12. The Beaction of Glycerides with Alcoholic Potash.

                  By A. H. Allen, F.G.S.

       13. Note on the Electrolysis of Alloys. By Henry C. Jenkins,

                                            Assoc.M.Inst.O.I<:., F.G.S.

      The importance of the question as to whether alloys are capable of being
 electrolysed has for a long time been recognised, and has already been under tho
notice of a Committee of this Association. Several experimenters have
endeavoured to separate the constituents of some alloys by this means, but
hitherto no success in this direction has been recorded.

     Doubtless one reason of this negative result may be found in the difficulty of
submitting a metallic bath to a sufficiently large difference of potential, owing to
its very low resistance ; but from the same cause there is another reason why

electrolysis should not take place, at least in the case of the majority of alloys, a
reason to which prominence does not hitherto seem to have been given.

     The variable polarisation, and the resistance of electrolytic baths generally, have
led to the adoption of the view that in an electrolytic bath the electricity is con-
veyed by some method of convection or of successive molecular discharge,

streams or chains of molecules carrying electrical charges from one electrode to

the other. The bath itself is formed of some body whose resistance when pure
is extremely high, so that it is usually necessary to add another body to it, an
impurity, which probably acts by increasing the number of free molecules present.
It is easy to imagine that in such an insulating medium molecules can be charged
with electricity, which charge they can retain until they reach some body having
a different potential to their own. But free molecules could not retain any
charge if entirely within a conducting envelope, and in contact with it ; and
although the possibility of the possession of a gaseous envelope by the molecules

forming a liquid has been recognised, still the conductivity of pure molten metals
is scarcely in favour of any view that there is insulation between their molecules.
If there were any considerable insulation it is difficult to account for the effects
upon electrolytes of very small electro-motive forces, and it will be thus seen
from these considerations that the want of success in the attempts to electrolyse

alloys still leaves quite open the question of their constitution, whilst it is in full
accordance with the conditions of Electrical Potential expressed by Laplace's

equation.

    From the fact that alloys in many cases form true compounds, which may he

obtained in a crystalline form if proper conditions are chosen, and because the

conditions as to temperature of an electrolytic bath may be those most favourable
for the precipitation of such a compound out of solution, it follows that all
future electrolytic experiments with alloys should be made at temperatures
sufficiently high to fuse any possible compounds, otherwise very deceptive results
would be obtained, owing to the difficulty of correctly sampling the bath.

The President delivered the following Address :

              CONTENTS.

1. Introduction. 2. Coal-field of South Wales, as studied by Logan, De la Beche,
     and others. 3. Origin of Coal. 4. Area of the Coal-growth. 5. Coal-field of
     South Wales : its extent, thickness, and constituent strata. C. Output of Coal in
    South Wales. 7. Varieties of Coal. 8. Constituents of Coal-measures and of

     Coal. 9. Fossils of the Coal-measures of South Wales. 10. Extent of the Coal-
     measures under the South of England. 11. Conclusion.

--1. Introduction. The black stones that hum probably came to be known by pre-

historic people through accident, here and there, long before any notion of their

worth to the community at large was entertained. Wood at first, and then char-

coal, supplied fuel far into historic times, on every hand, except perhaps in China.

In the first century of the Christian era the Romans, occupying England, met with

coal, and probably learnt its use from the natives. It seems, however, to have

been disregarded during the Saxon conquest and domination of this island ; but by

the beginning of the twelfth century the use of coal was well in hand again, as

shown by old charters relating to places in Scotland and the county of Durham.

   --The history of the use of coal is treated of in the following books : ' The Coal-

fields of Great Britain: their History, Structure, and Resources, with notices of

the Coal-fields of other parts of the World.' By Edward Hull, M.A., &c., with

maps and illustrations. 8vo. London. First edition, 1861 ; second, 1861 ; third,

1873; fourth, 1881. 'Coal: its History and Uses.' By Professors Green, Miall,

Thorpe, Riicker, and Marshall. Edited by Professor Thorpe. 8vo. London, 1878.

Also in the unpretentious pamphlet, ' The History of Coal.' By the Rev. Thomas

Wiltshire, M.A., &c. 8vo. London, 1878. Of course the most comprehensive

work on the British Coal-measures is the ' Report of the Commissioners appointed

to Inquire into the several matters relating to Coal in the United Kingdom,'

3 vols., with maps and sections. Fol. London, 1871. Other valuable works

W.are :  AV. Smyth's ' Coal and Coal-mining,' 8vo. 1867, and later editions ; and

Richard Meade's ' Coal and Iron Industries of the United Kingdom,' &c. Svo.

London, 1882. * Coal : its Geological and Geographical Position,' by Professor John

Morris, 8vo., London, 1862, although only a pamphlet, is valuable for its

information.

The subject of Coal and the Coal-measures is abundantly treated of in the

scientific literature of this centurj' in nearly all parts of the world, and it would

be useless to endeavour to do justice to its bibliography. Besides having had the

odvantage of the labours of the many eminent foreign geologists who have advsEced
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                                                                                                 615

our knowledge of the subject in one or otlierof its various aspects, both by original
research ^ and by condensing published results in treatises and manuals for stude°nts,*
we have had some of the most enthusiastic students of the natural history of the

Carboniferous strata and fossils iu our own country and within our own times.

Their names must frequently occur in speaking of coal and its belongings.

The text-books and manuals of geology by De la Beche, Phiflips, Trimmer,

Lyell, Ansted, Jukes, Geikie, Prestwich, Green, Etheridge, and others, are safe
guides; the Memoirs of the Geological Surveys of England and Wales, Scot-

land, Ireland, and India are mines of scientific wealth as regards the same matter ·

our paltEobotanists Lindley, Hutton, Artis, A^'itham, Morris, Hooker, Binney^
Bunbury, Dawes, Williamson, Oarruthers, Balfour, Kidston, &c., have given us "-ood

results; and others, not specialists, have written good matter for our consideration.

Abroad, among our American friends, we have, or have had, several of the State
geologists (Emmons, Lesquereux, Rogers, Lesley, Newberry, Dana), who have

studied the Coal-measures with  care, besides Steiuhauer, Brown,  and  others                                              but
                                                                                                      ;

no one has so earnestly and successfully given his serious attention to this branch
of geology and paleontology as Sir J. W. Dawson, of Montreal, not long since

President of the British Association when we met at Birmingham in 1886. His
numerous memoirs and his elaborate work on ' Acadian Geology ' supply abun-

dant facts and sound theories iu elucidation of the history of the Coal Period.

Sir ^y. E. Logan, who indeed by his studies in South Wales was the first to give

geologists a clue to the uiterpretation of much that was verv obscure about coal,

worked with Sir J. W. Dawson in the Nova-Scotiau coal-field ; and so also did
Sir Charles Lyell, who there and elsewhere devoted much energy and acumen to

the elucidation of the origin and formation of coal.

The indexes of successive volumes of the ' Geological Record ' show how abun-

dant have been papers and books on Coal, Coal-mines, Coal-fields, Carboniferous

fossils, and correlative studies, within the last few years, abroad and at home. The

subject^ is so extensive that we must confine ourselves to the coal of South Wales.

'2. The Coal-Jleld of South Wales, as studied bij Lor/an, De la Beche, and

others.--Kb,^ it been that the stone axe found in Moimiouthshire by Edward

Lloyd ^ were really associated with the outcrop of the coal there, and it truly be-

longuig to the Stone-age and used in hewing the coal, as Professor Hnll's mention

of it seems to imply,' it would, indeed, have been one amono- the few known

evidences of prehistoric coal-mining, and would tend to show that South Wales
was among the places first made to yield this useful mineral.

At the present day South Wales and Monmouthshire yield coal in greater

quantity and of more value (by over a million poimds sterling a year) than the

coal-fields of Northumberland and Durham, or of  Yorkshire  and   Derbyshire                                               and
                                                                                                                        ;

considerably more (by nearly 6,000,000^.) than that of the Clyde Basin and asso-

ciated coal-fields of Scotland. Indeed, the annual value of the coal produced in

South Wales with Monmouthshire may be said to be about eleven millions out

ot the whole forty-five millions sterling estimated as the value of the coal at the
pit's mouth throughout the United Kingdom.

     The great coal-field of South Wales has the especial credit of having supplied
some of the earliest and most important facts and phenomena illustrative of the

geological succession of the materials of the Coal-measures, and of the natural

history of the coal itself. To the persevering energy and accurate observation of
Sir William E. Logan and Sir Henry T. De la Beche South AVales gave up the

secrets of coal-growth, strengthening some earlier suppositions, correcting others,

and establishing a firm basis for the theory that the coal has, for by far the most

part, been formed of plants growing where the coal now lies, although some local

varieties have arisen from the occasional driftage of floating timber and herbage,

and of long-continued maceration of vegetable matter in lakes and pools elsewhere.

Mr. (afterwards Sir) \V. E. Logan, having for several years worked on the

geology of South Wales, in 1837 gave his maps and information to the enthusiastic

promoter of the Geological Survey of the British Islands, Mr. (afterwards Sir)

H. T. De la Beche, for public use in the construction of the Survey Map and in

developing the structure of the country. The first volume of the ' Memoirs of the

Geological Survey,' 1846, contains, at p. 145, Sir H. T. De la Beche's acknowledg-
ment of Sir (then Mr.) W. E. Logan's gift of the valuable results of his investiga-

tions in the Coal-measures and discovery of the nature and meaning of the frequent

underclays, an account of which Mr. Logan had already publislied in the ' Annual

Report of the Royal Institution of South Wales ' for 18o9 ; in the 'Proceedings
of the Geological Society of London,' vol. iii., February 1840, p. '276, and March

1842, p. 707, &c. : and ' Transactions of the Geological Society,' second series,

vol. vi., 1842, p. 491, &c.

The hypotheses of the formation of coal offered by earlier writers are carefully

reviewed  in  De  la                                                                                     Beche's  elaborate  memoir                                        and the growth of opinion  as  to
                                                                                                                                                                        ;

coal having been made by plants growing in place is traced from De Luc (1793),

Lindley and llutton (1833 and 1835), Adolphe Brongniart (1838), to W. E. I^ogan,

by whom, indeed, it was fully established before 1837. Opinions as to the nature

of the Stir/maria ficoides, so abundant in the ' underclays,' are also referred to

and that it is really the root of Sif/illaria is accepted on the good authority of

Brongniart and Binney (p. 150). Dr. Buckland's summary (in his Anniversary

Addresses to the Geological Society, 1840 and 1841) > of what had been advanced

by British geologists in the elucidation of the Coal-measures and their natural

history comprised mainly the observations made by Ansted, llawkshaw, Barber,

Beaumont, J. E. Bowman, and particularly W. E. Logan. He stated in

his Address of 1840 that ' some of the vegetables which foi-med our beds of

coal grew on tlie identical banks of sand and silt and mud which, being now

indurated to stone and shale, form the strata that accompany the coal ; whilst

other portions of these plants have been drifted to various distances from the

swamps, savannahs, and forests that gave them birth, particularly those that are

dispersed through the sandstones, or mixed with fishes in the shale beds.'

Dr. Buckland's summary in 1841 is given by De la Beche - ' as expressing his

opinion that the Stifftnnriajicoides [which was at that time still regarded by many as

an individual floating plant], growing in ponds or lagoons in the localities where we
now discover its remains, hj mixture with mud or silts disseminated among them,

formed the underbeds, upon which also grew the plants which now form the coal-

beds, these latter, by subsidence, being covered by sand or mud, forming sand-

stone or shale, between the coal strata, successive coal-beds being formed as the

necessary conditions arose.' Sir (then Mr.) G. Lyell's important additions to the

subject, then lately given in his ' Travels in North America,' 2 vols., 1845, quoted
and applied by De la Beche, were subsequently enlarged in his ' Second Visit,' &e.,

2 vols., 1849, and in his ' Elements of Geology,' edition of 1851, and subsequently.

    De la Beche's Memoir, after having presented some explanations of geological

phenomena, and treated of the general range and occurrence of the Silurian and

  --3. Origin of Coal. Coal is now generally accepted as being a compressed and

chemically altered mass of ancient vegetables. The tissue of some of the trees

and other plants may be detected in the substance more or less distinctly by frac-

ture, by burning, and in thin sections. In some cases trees occur rooted in the

attitude of growth, their stems rising upwards and their roots remaining in or

below the coal. The accumulation of coal as seams of varying thicknesses, in very

numerous parallel beds, can be explained by the gradual and long-continued sub-

sidence of long and wide tracts of old marginal sea-beds, estuaries, and lagoons,

with adjoining lands,' all more or less invested with vegetation. At the same time

limited, isolated, and lenticular patches and nests of pure coal, usually in sand-

stone, have been probably due to floating masses of vegetation, matted plants and

trees, becoming waterlogged and sinking in estuaries and shallow seas.

    Some highly bituminous coal, like cannel and torbanite, may have been due to

limited accumulations of macerated plants rotting   in water                                            or  to the bursting of
                                                                                                     ;

those natural reservoirs, like peat-bogs, and a local arrangement of the resulting

flow of Carbonaceous mud.

    Mr. W. Galloway, in his memoir ' On the Mode of Occurrence of Coal,'- care-

fully places before his readers the two sets of opinions about the origin and

formation of coal. First, as to the place of growth and of carbonisation being on

the same ground, following De la Beche's statements and conclusions ; and,

secondly, as to the accumulation of vegetable matter, some dead and broken, some

already decomposed, derived from the forests and herbage of marshy lands, and

deposited in great lakes (as expressed by C. Graud'Eury in the ' Annales des

Mines,' 1882), with the Stigmarice living and dying as water-plants (as they were

at first regarded, and thought to have been formed of a central body and long-

spreading arms and leaves) ; while tall trees grew here and there on the water-

side, until, falling  down, they lay prostrate  in  the  black  mud                                         or, breaking  ofi',
                                                                                           ;

left their rotting stumps still standing upright.

Mr. Galloway accepts the latter opinion to some extent, because he finds the

roots in underclays to have no direct communication with the coals above

--them, on account of the presence of persistent shaly layers, or 'partings,'
--traversing coal-beds, and very intimately passing into the coaly matter itself, on

account of a seam being cannel-coal, blackband-ironstone, and shale in dift'erent

parts of its extent, with a coal lying on it without an intervening underclay ; and

if this shows that a coal can have been formed without an underclay, he argues

that any underclay need not have been necessarily the soil of a coal-seam. He
acknowledges the subject to be one of difficulty ; and it seems to me that some at

least, if not all, of the difficulties have been already removed by De la Beche,

Lesley, Lyell, Dawson, and other observers.

    4. Area of the Coal-grotvth.--YoT knowledge of what ruled the local occur-
rence of coal, Tve owe a great debt to Mr. K. A. 0. Godwin-Austen, who had

studied the geology of the South-western Counties with De la Beche. To him

we are indebted for the approximate demarcation of the bounds and margins of

the Carboniferous Formations, particularly for the probable land-limits and

outward extension of the Coal-measures. In his valuable memoir ' On the

possible Extension of the Coal-measures,' ' he explained the reasons for his indicat-

ing on the map then communicated to the Geological Society the physical con-

figuration of North-western Europe at the close of the Palaeozoic Period, and the

outline of the surfaces which supported the coal-vegetation. He concluded to

define the place and range of this old coal-growth of what is now Western

Europe as

    ' An internal sea, around and occasionally over large parts of which the

peculiar vegetation of the time was developed and entombed as the area rose and

Asank.  region with a central depressed area, such as Australia is supposed to

present, and going down, by means of a long series of oscillations, would ultimately

present just such an assemblage of deposits as our own Carboniferous group ' (p. 73).

   A further reference to this kind of le"\'el or hollow region is as follows :

' The large level tracts which lie west of the Blue Mountains in Austi-alia, into

which the Lachlan, the Darling, the Murrumbidgee, and the Darling discharge.'

(Godwin-Austen's Lecture, Royal Institution of Great Britain, April 16, 1858.)

     Such an area had also been indicated in Sir H. De la Beche's note to p. 296 of
his memoir above mentioned, where he refers to ' the great area extending from

the country drained by the Volga, eastward through eighty degrees of longitude

into China, and from which the waters find no course outwards to the main ocean

--or to the seas connected with it.' With a gradual depression with the detritus
--swept in by the rivers and with a suitable flora and climate, there might here be

both extensive accumulations of vegetable matter grown in place, as well as

limited deposits of drifted plants, under different conditions. De la Beche, more-

over, referred (p. 146) to the long flat coast of the eastern seaboard of South
America, with its great rivers and abundant flora, as being analogous to some

parts, at least, of the areas on which the coal-seams w(U'e formed.

     The area of coal-growth in this North-west European region is represented on
Mr. II. A. C. Godwin-Austen's map ^ as a littoral belt (varying in width as now

exposed at the surface), reaching, in an approximately semicircular or bay like

shape, from the Elbe near Magdeburg, and north of the Ilartz, westward to the

valley of the Ruhr, including a southern extension to Marburg; and, taken up

again, it passes from the Ruhr to Aix-la-Chapelle, and to Namur and Charleroi

then by the Franco-Belgian coal-field to Calais, and beneath the valley of the

Thames to Bristol, Forest of Dean, and South Wales, south of the Old Red area,

towards Ireland. On the eastern side of Hereford, and along the east border of

the old rocks of Wales, the range of the coal-growth is shown by the coals

appearing here and there along the Severn and the Dee ; and doubtless it widened
out considerably eastward across what is now England. Continuing northward it

occupied Northumbria, and stretched westward locally between the old Cumbrian

land and the South Highlands passing around the east end of the latter, it was
                                                                                                                                                                        ;

strong across what is now Central Scotland, with indications in North Ireland.

Thus the coal-growth invested the southern and western edges of Godwin-Austen's

* internal sea ' above mentioned, and extended -westward by two outlets : one at

its south-west corner, by South Wales and the other on the north-west, by
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

Central Scotland, each into the Irish area, and thus roughly surrounding the

several older Palfeozoic lands of Wales, Ireland, Cumbria, and South Scotland.

In Professor Ramsay's account of the denuded remnants of the Welsh coal-

fields - the stretch of coal-growth along the border of the old Cambrian land is

clearly indicated in his statement, that

' One denuded edge of these accumulations now forms part of the counties of

Pembroke, Caermarthen, Glamorgan, and Monmouth, and is elsewhere exhibited

in the Forest of Dean, the narrow strips of Coal-measures north of May Hill in
Gloucestershire, the Clee Hills (outliers of the Forest of Wyre and Coalbrookdale),
the coal-fields south and west of Shrewsbury, and that of Oswestry, Wrexham,

and Mold. All these are but fragments of one great original coal-field, once

mantling round North Wales and the older rocks west of the Severn and north of

Bristol Channel.'

Both north and south, however, of the old Cumbrian area are a few seemuigly

isolated patches of coal ; but the Whitehav^en field is really tlie western portion

of the North-of-England coal-growth the coal of Anglesea belongs to the west-
                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

ward extension of the Lancashire field ; and that of Ingleton is a remnant of the

northern part of tbe latter towards the margin of the old Cumbrian land.

  --5. Coal-Jield of South Wales: its extent, thickness, and constituent strata. The

valuable coal-field of South Wales (estimated by some to occupy 640,000 acres,

and stated by others to be 906 square miles in extent) forms an irregular oval

basin or trough lying E. and W. (about fifty-six miles long, from Pontypool to

Caermarthen Bay), with a narrow extension westward beyond Caermarthen Bay,
through Pembrokeshire, to St. Bride's Bay (about seventeen miles long). The
greatest width is about sixteen miles. In 1881 there were 662 collieries at work
(see Hull, 1881). The strata of the whole area have been much undulated and
broken ; on the south they dip at an angle of 45°, and at about 12° on the north.

Great faults, approximately north and south, alter the levels from forty to a

hundred fathoms ; they are generally filled with clay ; but one, near Swansea,

many fathoms wide, is filled with fragments of the broken strata. (Trimmer.)

   A strong anticline once passed along the middle of the trough (E. and W.),

with its complemental synclines, one on each side. These have been somewhat

shifted (the eastern moiety towards the S.W., and the other to the N.E.) by a

great dbWqxxe fault coincident with the valley of the Neath. Except at Swansea

and Caermarthen Bays, the outcrops of the lowest part of the series of strata, of
irregular width, are continuous around the coal-field. About seven unequal

patches of the upper measures have been preserved from denudation in the

syncli7ies. Two of these areas are in the eastern moiety ; both long, but the
southern syncline retains only a narrow and interrupted series of patches.' The
Ebbw, the Sirhowy, the Rhymney, and the upper part of the Afon cross the

former ; the Tafl" and the Rhondda, with their branches, cross both synclines
and the Ely and Ogwr cross the lower syncline. The respective valleys give

local opportunities for opening certain beds, and afl'ord facilities for roads and

railways from the hills to the sea-coast. In the western moiety there are five

circumscribed areas of the upper measures in the two synclines ; the united

Amman and Llwchwr River runs between four of them, and the Tawe between

two and across one (just north of Swansea). The favourable position for mining

some of the measures is due to the local angle of dip in the synclinal strata
and, indeed, without the anticlinal arrangement some of the coals could never

have been reached even by deep mines."
    Mr. Etheridge (in his new edition of Phillips's ' Manual of Geology,' 1885, p.

238) mentions that in the southern part of the western moiety the Coal-measures
have a thickness of 11,000 feet ; and that on the northern side of the anticlinal axis

there they are 7,000 feet thick, and that near Britton Ferry, in the middle, they

diminish to 4,800 feet on that side.

    Taking the whole basin or trough, it may be roundly said that in the north-

east side the coals are mainly coking or partly bituminous ; to the west and north-
west they are anthracitic ; and in the south bituminous or gaseous ; and more

especially that ' in the Aberdare area the coals are very free-burning, but at the

same time smokeless ; hence their importance for steam purposes, especially the

Aberdare four-foot steam-coal.' ^
     The physical features and structural condition of the South-Welsh coal-field,

also the occurrence of fossils, were succinctly treated of by G. P. Bevan in the

' Geologist,' vol. iii., 1860, pp. 90-99.

    The order and thickness of the strata belonging to the coal-field of South

Wales as given in Geikie's ' Textbook of Geology,' 2nd edit., 1885, p. 742, are (for

Glamorganshire) :

Upper series : sandstones, shales, &c., with 26  Feet.
                                                 3,400
  ....coal-seams, more than

Pennant grit : hard, thick-bedded sandstones,

and 15 coal-seams                                3,246

Lower series : shales, ironstones, and 34 coal-

seams                                            450 to 850

Millstone-grit.

     The Coal-measures are thus estimated at 7,496 feet, or nearly 1^ mile in
thickness, besides the Millstone-grit and the Carboniferous or Mountain Lime-
stone occupying a stil] lower position.

     Differences of observation or of opinion from time to time have caused different

estimates. In 1855 Professor J. Phillips, who took a very strong interest in the
geology of the coal-fields, published the following measurements (in his * Manual

of Geology,' 1855, p. 201) as representing only a general view, and he indicated

that nearly 12,000 feet thickness may occur near Llanelly :

            Llanelly series, with several beds of coal                                                                                                                                                                                                .          Feet.

workable coal. In 1881 Professor Hidl calculated that there remained about

32,166 millions of tons of available coal, which might possibly last for more than

1,000 years at the present rate of consumption.

Mr. E. Rogers, in the ' Memoirs of the Geol. Survey : Iron-ores,' Part III.,

1861, p. 169, divides the Coal-measures of South Wales into an Upper and a
Lower series, with the hard siliceous sandstone (locally a conglomerate), known

as ' Cockshute ' and ' White Roclis ' between them. The upper measures, he says,

are mostly micaceous sandstones, locally known as ' Pennant Rocks.' The lower

series is sometimes termed the ' iron-bearing measures,' as it contains the bulk of

the ironstone as well as coal, which is bituminous on the east and gradually less
and less bituminous westward, until after passing the great dyke or fault in the
Vale of Neath it becomes anthracite. The upper series contains few iron-ores, and

the coal is bituminous, even when anthracite exists below it, as in the Swansea

district and elsewhere.

In his communication to the British Association in 1837,- Sir W. E. Logan

stated that ' the non-bituminous coal, or stone-coal, is found on the north side and

at the west end ; the bituminous coal on the south side and east end ; and that
there is an intermediate region occupied by an intermediate quality.' These

conditions of the coal-seams indicated to Logan ' the possibility of a rule in the

--change of quality namely, that it occurs in parallel planes, cutting the seams of

coal without regard to their strike or inclination, and dipping to the soutli or east

of south.'

    These coals begin to become anthracitic at Rhymney ; and the change becomes
gradually more and more marked as we pas9 by Dowlais, Cyfartha, Hirwain,

Onlwyn, and Neath Talley, to the Swansea Valley,^ according to analyses given
ty Mr. David Mushet in the Appendix to his ' Papers on Iron and Steel,' 8vo.,
London, 1840. At page 68 of this book Mr. Mushet notes that ' in South Wales

as the coals approach the anthracite district they are found to contain 90 per cent,

(of carbon), with no more flame than is necessary to convert the coal into

coke.'

making the Coal-measures more than 1^ mile thick, and the whole series more

than 2i miles.
     Looking at these Coal-measures alone, and considering that slow depression

accompanied their formation, the mind is strained in estimating the time required

for the gradual subsidence to 10,000 feet, with shallow water always in place,

and jungle growing steadily after jungle, inundation following inundation at

--intervals, and is somewhat confused in reasoning on the possible causes and the

exact processes by which not only the sinking of this region of the earth's crust
was brought about, but how, in turn, the 10,000 feet of new accumulations and
deposits were raised into the great undulations, which Professor Ramsay has
described and depicted in his Memoir before mentioned, and how and when they

were slowly worn down day by day into the present beautifully varied surface of

South Wales and adjacent country.

I may bore remark that the analogous coal-field of Nova Scotia, investigated

by Sir W. E. Logan, Sir J. W. Dawson, and others, has a thickness of 14,570

feet, including seventy-six seams of conl and ninety distinct Stigmarian underclays.

Mr. W. 'Galloway communicated, in 1885, to the Cardiff Naturalists'

Society ^ some valuable observations on both the vertical and the horizontal

occurrence   of difierent  coals  in  South  Wales                          and  showed by a  map  (pi. iii.)
                                                                         ;

where the ' steam-coal ' mainly exists in the large eastern third; the ' intermediate

coal' in the narrow jn/ffrfZe third; and 'anthracite' in th.Q western third of the

Glamorgan-lMonmouthshire area. He refers to the gradual transition from

bituminous to anthracitic coal along a hypothetical plane passing through the

coal-field, with its major axis lying E.N.E.-W.S.W., and its minor axis dipping

at a very low angle towards S.S.E. He accepts Professor Geikie's tabular scheme
of the strata at p. 24. Mr. W. Galloway has favoured me with the following

remarks on the vertical place of the several kinds of coal in the series:--'The
long-faminfi bituminous seams are about 700 yards higher in the ground than the
semi-bituminous seams ; the semi-bituminous, or good steam-coal seams are 200

or 300 yards above the dry steam-coal seams ; the last are perhaps 300 yards

above the bastard anthracites; and tl '>>e inferior anthracites may be 400 yards or

more above the perfect anthracites. You have thus somewhere about, say, 1,500
or 1,600 yards from the long-flaming coals to the anthracites. It may be a good
deal more in some parts of the coal-field ; but, as the deepest shaft is only about

800 yards, we cannot get a direct measurement.'
    Of these three sorts of coal--the long-flaming dry coals above have some seams

suitable for gas-making ; the middle are caking coal, good for making coke ; the

others produce dry steam-coal and anthracites.

quantity of coal raised in South Wales last year as compared with that got ten

    In the Franco-Belgian coal-field the coals become more and more anthracitic
as they pass down to greater depths ; both kinds, therefore, were of the same age
in formation ; in South Wales also, as already stated, the anthracite and the
other coals are all of one age. The squeezing, faultincr, and inversions in the
former field are accompanied by an alteration of the highly bituminous coals into

dry coals and anthracite.

    An interesting histoiical sketch of the use of anthracite, and some systematic

remarks on its distribution in South Wales, were given by J. P. Bevan, F.G.S., in

the ' Geologist,' vol. ii., 1859, pp. 7-5-80.

    The anthracite of Pennsylvania is traceable from the inner folds of the moun-
tain chain, where the strata have become more and more crystalline, and contain
graphite as well as this non-bituminous coal, westward into Ohio, where the same
beds consist of ordinary coal. In the eastern part of the Alleghanies the coal has
only 6 to 14 per cent, of volatile matter, further west 16 to 22 per cent., 30 to 35
per cent., and in Ohio 40 to 50 per cent. (Prestwich.) Tliis coal-field before com-
pression was probably 900 miles long by more than 200 broad in some places.

(Lyell.)

The depression of strata by accumulated sediment above them may raise then-

temperature by the rise of the isogeotherms (surfaces of equal subterranean tempera-

ture), and they may reach a relatively high temperature. ' Mere descent to a great

depth, however, will not necessarily result in any marked lithological change, as

has been shown in the cases of the Nova-Scotian and South- Welsh coal-fields,

where sandstones, shales, clays, and coal-seams can be proved to have been once

depressed 14,000 to 17,000 feet below the sea-level, under an overlying mass of

rock, and yet to have sustained no more serious alteration than the partial con-

version of the coal into anthracite. They must have been kept for a long period

exposed to a temperature of at least 212° Fahr. Such a temperature would have

been sufficient to set some degree of internal change in progress bad any appre-
ciable quantity of water been present, whence the absence of alteration may per-

haps be explicable on the supposition that those rocks were comparatively dry.'

Coal in contact with granite is      changed into anthracite  or  graphite                                          when  in
                                                                                                                 ;

contact with volcanic and trappean rocks it may become coke (columnar or other-

wise) or mere soot.
     Steam coal is very compact, burns with little smoke, and contains so little

bituminous matter that it is not liable to spontaneous combustion, whether pyrites
be present or not. It is an intermediate kind of coal, having more hydrocarbon

than any anthracite has.
     Ordinary coal, common coal, household coal, pit coal, black coal, coal proper,

bituminous stone coal : of this there are several sorts :
     1. Caking coal, coking coal, bituminous coal (not really bituminous, but con-

--taining the constituents of bitumen 7 to 9 per cent, of hydrogen, witli carbon and

oxygen, or 4 to 6 per cent, of hydrogen and 6 to 8 per cent, of oxA'gen). When

heated, it undergoes a kind of fusion and ' cakes ' together, one piece adhering to
another by the soft bituminous matter into which it is mainly changed. Such
coals are used for coking, coke being more or less impure carbon left after the

hydrocarbons have been driven off".

2. Cherry coal, or soft coal, is thinly laminated, soft, velvety, short-fractured,

friable.

     3. Spli7it coal (breaking off" in long ' boards,' and into fragments with angular

--ends called 'splints' Mushet), bone coal, hai-d coal, free-burning coal, dry coal

(passing into shaly, slaty, and stony coal). This is less bituminous than some of
the foregoing ; burns free and open (that is, without swelling and caking), with a
long smoky flame ; with less than G to 8 per cent, oxygen and 4 to 6 per cent,
hydrogen ; it is also called dry coal. The hard coal comes out in long blocks ; the

cherry coal in short pieces.

     Reedy coal has alternate layers of splint coal and bright coal. (Mushet.)
     Cannel coal, or parrot coal, is compact, and varies from lustrous to a dull earthy
aspect ; breaks irregularly, but with a conchoidal (shell-like) fracture ; can be

      Torbanite, Torbanehill 7nineral, Boghead cannel-coal, or Boghead coal, is a kind
of dark brown cannel-coal, good for making gas and oil (paraffin, &c.), and gives
a light, spongy coke. It consists of minute light brown granules of hydrocarbon,
with some earthy matter and portions of the tissues of coal-plants.

--8. Constituents of the Coal-measures and of Coal. Sandstone, shale, coal, and

clay, in successive repetitions, constitute (as we all know) the main materials of the

' Coal-measures ' {' measures ' being an old mining term for strata). Each of these

suhstances well deserves the close investigation they have received from numerous

Weobservers.    need not take the sandstone in hand now ; it will be enough to

say that tlie quartz-grains have been derived from the quartz of the same granite
rocks which gave the little mica-flalies to mix with much of the sandstone, and the

kaolin to form the basis of the shales and clays in the same great Carboniferous

--formation.
     Shales and Ironstone. The shales are varied ; some are almost purely argilla-

ceous others contain carbonaceous matter in different proportions, even becoming
                               ;

quite black and bituminous. The lighter coloured shales often have plant-remains,

especially ferns, scattered through them, and even whole stems and branches of
Lepidodendron and Sigillaria, squeezed flat, and reaching long distances. The

darker shales also have plant-remains, but less perfect, and very often shells and

other fossils, including relics of fish and numbers of small bivalved crustaceans
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

with regard to the last, the fishes, when alive, fed on the Cypridffi and such like,
and in turn these little Ostracoda ate the dead fishes when they could.

    Here and there are more or less continuous layers oi ironstone, or more frequently

groups of nodules parallel with the planes of bedding, and containing either parts

of plants, more rarely small limidoids or other crustaceans, or even spiders, scor-

pions, insects, or relics of fishes and amphibia. In some cases the shales are of
marine origin, judging from the character of the shells imbedded in them ; but
usually the evidence from the fossils is of a negative character. The shells that
were formerly thought to be mussel-shells, like freshwater Unios, are now known
to belong to a different family ; and, not being quite the same as any known sea-
shell, they may have been estuarine.

     The nodular and the flat masses of clay-ironstones in the shales have been due

to the formation of carbonic acid in the water and mud by the decomposition of

vegetable matter and the removal of some oxygen from the peroxide of iron pre-

sent there, and by the carbonic acid thereupon forming carbonate of iron. This

then segregated around some organic object in the mud, and, mingled with clay,

gave rise to nodules or larger masses of argillaceous ironstone.' In consolidating,

the nodules frequently split internally, and the fissures of retreat, filled with

calcite, blende, pyrites, or other mineral, constitute septa, or diyisiona, in the

septarium or septarian nodule. The so-called ' beetle-stones ' are septarian nodules

broken across, showing a central and diverging lines.

The iron-ores of South Wales are fully treated of in the ' Memoirs Geol. Surv.,'

W.Iron-Ores, Part III., 1861, by E. Rogers, and their fossils by J.  Salter.  From

official sources we learn that the details of Production of Ironstone, chiefly Argil-

laceous Carbonate from mines under the Coal-mines Regulation Act, for the year

1889 were--

up hj water (a few inches may. have been enough) to undergo the advanced
chemical change causing a proportional increase of b^-drogen. The dead sticks and
stems projecting out of and above the water-covered peaty mass below would natu-
rally supply the decaying touchwood and charcoal now lying as described above.

     "Doubtless a progressive change in the elaboration of hydrocarbon soon took
place to some extent, even as it does in peat ; but probably it was not completed

in the compact coal until many layers of both vegetable and earthy matters had

been accumulated (the former in place, and the latter from inundations), and caused
some amount of pressure and consequent heat.

      As, under favourable circumstances, the bright coal can be seen to have been
made up of spores, leaves, branches, and stems of special trees and other plants,

the place of growth must have been a swampy forest or jungle, of enormous
extent, probably in a warm (perhaps sub-tropical') climate, to account for the

hundreds of square miles of continuous coal-seams.

     Much has been learnt from the broken and rotting ruins of a forest, standing

on an area of the coal-growth, having been here and there sealed up and preserved
in that original state, before hydrocarbonisation had proceeded far ; whilst the
rest of the fallen timber and accumulated relics passed into the state of bright
coal, and became almost indistinguishable as to its structure except under the
microscope after special manipulation. The ' coal-balls ' of Oldham, in Lancashire,
and the 'bullions' at South Owram, in Yorkshire, are calcareo-carbonaceous
nodules, having been formed by the infiltration of water carrying carbonate of
lime from the shells in an overlying shale down into the bed of woody fragments
and other bits of dead plants. The carbonate of lime there segregated from the
mass to certain centres, and preserved, in round nodules, the vegetable structures,
before they were quite decomposed, more or less distinct as they had fallen on the
forest floor. Hooker,. Binuey,AVilliamson, and others have elucidated much of the

botany of the coal from this source.
     In the Lower Carboniferous series at Pettycur Bay, Burntisland, in the Firth

of Forth, are some well-preserved relics of the materials which would otherwise
have been used to form a coal-seam (referred to )}y Williamson and Binney). In
this case volcanic material has been ejected into or through a peaty mass, and,
having removed by force some of the soft wet material, has been mixed up with it
and settled down as a hard stratum, with well-preserved fragments of wood and
other tissues, into which carbonate of lime was subsequently intiltered. (Oarruthers.)

    A third instance was discovered by Mr. Wiinsch, in 1865, in the Lower Car-

boniferous series on the north-eastern shore of the Isle of Arran, where numerous
plant-remains are well preserved in and under volcanic ashes. The strata are
alternate sandy shales, thin coal-seams, and peperino-like tuff. Numerous truncated

trees remain upright, rooted in the shale. Sigillaria, Lejndodendron, Lepidophloios,

and Halonia, besides Sphenopteris and other ferns, are present.^

   --Cannel, Sj-c. Lender the name of 'cannel' are known some important varieties

of coal, useful for distillation and gas-making ; and certainly they differed in their

method of deposition both from ordinary coal and in some particulars among
themselves. They all appear to have been formed of vegetable matter that, having
been soaked and macerated to a black pulp, like the most rotten and semi-fluid
peat, in lakes, lagoons, or other limited water-areas, became homogeneous masses
of hydrocarbon,"with much still discernible vegetable tissue, and occasionally
with bones, teeth, and scales of fishes, and the low kind of reptiles called Amphibia.
Earthy matter was sometimes mixed with the cannel ; and occasionally so much
accumulated that the black mud graduated into carbonaceous shale. Light sub-
stances would also have been blown into the water by wind. According to the
relative abundance of yellow-reddish hydrocarbons and macrospores, or of amor-
phous black substance (carbon) and microspores, is the diflerence between black and

brown cannel. (Carpenter.)

     Elsewhere the condition and place of the cannel are such as to suggest that,

    ' A great predominance of ferns and lycopods indicates moisture, equability of

temperature, and freedom from frost, rather than intense heat. (Lyell.)

like a burst peat-bog of the present day (Buckland), the fluid carbonaceous pulp
escaped from its birthplace, and found local hollows at lower levels that could

receive and keep it. It is also suggested that such black, decomposed, fluid refuse

of a swampy jungle, bordering a lagoon, might drain into the water, and settle as
carbonaceous mud, or as coal itself, among the water-plants there. (Grand'Eury.)

If poured in suddenly, it probably overwhelmed and poisoned many fishes.
* The cannel coals, being wholly subaqueous, have not formed and do not possess

mineral charcoal.' (Dawson.)

Torbanite consists almost entirely of minute sub-globular accretions of hydro-

carbon (amber-coloured by transmitted light), derived either from chemical change

of plant-remains, or, more probably, directly from lycopodiaceous spores.

   YSpore-coal.-- ery much of the substance of some coal-beds consists of lycopo-

diaceous spores that have been traced to the great lycopods, Lepidode^idron and

Sigillaiia, allied to the club-mosses and Selaginellce, and were probably shed
periodically in enormous quantities. (Prestwich and Morris, Hooker, Binney,

Williamson, Carruthers, Balfour, Huxley, E. T. Newton, Orton, Dawson, Rheinsch,

Wethered, Bennie, Kidston, and others.) Mr. E. Wethered has suggested that the
chief material in common coal was derived from the spores of a water-plant nearly
allied to Isoetes, and that woody material has supplied but little of the hydro-

carbon. He objects to the theory of 'submerged forests ' because of the difficulty

that Professor Dana has described, resulting in the calculation that for a four-foot
seam of coal there would be required a thickness of 32 feet of accumulated forest

vegetation and 48 feet for four feet of anthracite.* The macrospores of Isoetes

lacustris have been found in the mud dredged in Loch Coulter, Stirlingshire, bv

Mr. Thos. Scott.2

    ' Dawson is disposed to think that the tuberin of cork, of epidermis in general,

and of spore-cases in particular, is a substance so rich in carbon that it is very

near to coal, and so indestructible and impermeable to water that it has contributed
more largely than anything else to the mineral.' ^ Prestwich refers to these, and
especially to gums and resins, as main constituents of the coal ; and argues that

the climate was warm and moist, with a larger percentage of carbonic acid than

exists at the present day, and a more rapid plant-growth.*

Messrs. Bennie and Kidston* have not only carefully given the botanical

history of Lepidodendron and Sigillaria, and of their fructification, but have

described the spores met with in their examination of the Scotch Carboniferous

strata, and have given their conclusions as to the nature and condition of the

beds from which the spores were collected. The splint and parrot coals yielded

most                       the  cherry or  soft  coals  are  too  far  bituminised  to  show  them  clearly,
                        ;

though present. Some fireclays yield them in the upper two or three inches.

Some thin shales (plant-beds and fakes) yield spores, and some have plant-remains

as well. 'Carbonised wood was common in all the poor or shale-like coals. . . .
Some of the thin coals were almost entirely composed of such carbonised vegetable

matter.' Fragments of scorpions and eurypterids occur plentifully in some of

the ' old soils ' (fireclays). The former, being land-animals, and probably adapted

to a hot (or, at least, warm) climate, are among the most interesting of the coal-

fossils.

  --Drift-coal. Formerly, more so than now, it was thought by some that the coal

had been formed by the accumulation of drifted timber and floating masses of

vegetation in rivers and estuaries. There are several difficulties in the way of

this hypothesis. There would have been more ash in the coal, because the water

would shift and deposit sand and clay, together with rafts and grass islands ; and

the ash of pure coal agrees in relative quantity and composition with the earthy

Howmatter naturally contained in plants. (Green and others.)                            far a calculation

could be made as to a given quantity of ash in coal, and the amount of mineral

matter belonging to plants, as a basis for proving the original quantity of woody

matter concerned in a given quantity of coal, would be difficult to determine, for

some of the original mineral constituents have been probably removed by per-

colating water.

Professor Lesley^ has calculated that the Mississippi could not supply by

driftage from the forests of its valley in 100,000 years wood enough for one of the

Schuylkill anthracite beds ; mineral sediments would also interfere with the

results. Under favourable conditions, he adds, tropical forests (Central Africa)

and coast-swamps (Florida, Guiana, India) would supply good and sufficient

material. So also the swamps of the ' Sunk Country ' of Arkansas and Louisiana,
as well as the ' Great Dismal Swamp ' iu Virginia, for one set of conditions
(Lyell) ; and the mangrove jungles in the West Indies and elsewhere for another.

       Fireclay, underclay, undercliff, underbed, seat-earth, seat-stone, b(jt,tom-stone,

spavin, chinch, fake, jiouncin. This is usually a dense clay," but sometimes sandy,

and even altogether a hard sandstone (' ganister '). It varies in colour from

Ablack to white ; and is from six inches to ten feet or more in thickness.

characteristic feature is its being penetrated in all directions by the stigmarian

roots and rootlets of the trees {Sigillaria and Lepidodendi-on) that grew on it

when it was the soil of the coal-forest, having been slowly deposited by the quiet,
shallow, muddy waters that succeeded the deposition of shale or sandstone by

waters with stronger currents, these last terminating one of the periodical dis-

turbances to which the many stages of gradual subsidence gave rise. Every coal-

bed (or coal-seam, according to the application of those words to either a simple

or compound layer of coal) lies on a more or less distinguishable ' underclay ' ; but

this is often omitted to be recorded in coal-mining sections and documents.^ Some-

times an underclay forms the roof of a coal ; but it is the seat-earth of a coal

--lying on it.
    Denudation. Among the many examples of denudation in the Coal-measures,

coal-beds have been washed away from  their  underclays                                                      but these  latter  are  so
                                                                                                          ;

greatly toughened by their contained network of roots that they have more

effectually resisted denudation. Both coals and underclays, however, were not

unfrequently destroyed, or, at least, deeply and widely channelled by contempo-

raneous floods and rivers ; for not onlj' are the ' horses,' 'lows,' and 'washes ' such

watercourses, but the occurrence of pebbles of coal and small detrital particles

scattered through some of the sandstones are due to similar denudation.'*

  --Sir J. W. Dawson, in ' Acadian Geology,' 1868, p. lo9, states: 'The occa-

sional inequalities of the floors of the coal-beds, the sand and gravel ridges which

traverse them, the channels cut through the coal, the occurrence of patches of

sand, and the insertion of wedges of such material, splitting the beds, . . . are

constantly represented in modern swamps and marshes, more especially near their

margins, or where they are exposed to the effects of ocean storms or river inunda-

tions.' The great thickness of coal and carbonaceous shale in the Albion Coal-

measures at Pictou, Nova Scotia, were formed in a depression separated by a

shingle bar (conglomerate) from the more exposed flats outside.*

enumeration, of the fossils would be much more than we have time for now,

whether we took in hand the plants or the animals.

^ In examining microscopically the ultimate particles of some shales and under-

clays, Mr. W. M. Hutchings has discovered that these are composed of a ' micaceous

deposit,' in which there is some fragmental mica, but that the mass appears to con-

sist mainly of minute, rutiliferous, mica-like flakes, regarded by him as of secondary

origin, made from the original components of the stratum. (Geol. Maff., 1890 and

1891.) Mr. Hutchings kindly informs me that, of the numerous fireclays which he

has examined, several are being used for brick-making. (Letter, May 20, 1891.)

ferns, and cycadaceous plants (the last known by their fruits chiefly) have been well

described and figured. Ividston's ' Catalogue of the Carboniferous Plants in the

British Museum ' gives fall references to many of the above, and the others are
well known. W^th increased knowledge, the supposed dome-like, long-armed,

Stigmarian plants, with subaqueous leaves or processes, either floating on or in the

water, or growing on the mud, have become the depressed stools, dichotomous

roots, and innumerable long, narrow, leaf-shaped rootlets of Sigillaria and Lepido-

dendi-on. (Binney and others.) C. Grand'Eury, however, still distinguishes some

perfectly aquatic and peculiar plants, which floated in the water with their roots

trailing on the bottom                                                                                                         and of Stigmaria he  holds  the     opinion                    that  it  indicates  a

formation in deep water, contrary (as he says) to what is generally stated.^ The

supposed palms have disappeared in the explanation that the supposed fruits are

only the marks of compressed gas bubbles fixed daring their escape from the foetid

black, decomposing mud."

Great advances have been made by Prof, Dr. W. C. Williamson in the know-

ledge of the lycopodiaceous trees of the coal, which he shows to have partaken

of the exogenous structure of modern trees.

Various more or less artistic representations of ideal coal-forests are to be met

with, both in special books treating of the subject and in treatises on geology in

general. Eloquent descriptions of such a forest by Ansted and Hugh Miller are

quoted by Balfour.'

Of the flora of the Uplands, which were bordered by the peaty coal-swamps,

very little is known ; only that the fern fronds and some other plants in the roof

shales, and the occasional either prostrate or snag-like trunks of conifers in the

sandstones were probably brought to lower levels by streams or river-floods.

(Dawson, Lyell, and others.)

II. The fossil animals of the coal are necessarily of very gi'eat interest, but

we can now refer to only a few.

1. Of the invertebrates a fair number occur in South Wales, but none of the

myriopods, spiders, scorpions, eurypterids, land shells, and other rare forms known

elsewhere have yet been met with.

In the ' Memoirs of the Geological Survey of Great Britain,' &c., Iron-Ores,

W.&c., Part III., the late Mr. J.                                                                                                 Salter very carefully classified and tabulated the

fossils found in the ' ironstone bands ' of South W'ales, describing and figuring the

most characteristic species. He hoped to have taken up the fossils of the coal

bands in like manner, but unfortunately the time never came. His observations,

at p. 220, on the importance of managers of collieries and others making very

careful collections of fossils, with notes on their exact beds, should even now

command attention. He notes as follows :                                                                                                            .... Brackish

Anthracosia ' was originally regarded as Unio by Sowerby, then referred to

Cardinia by Agassiz, and to Pachyodon by Stutchbury ; but it was ultimately

W.defined by    King as related to Unio, but, being distinct from that genus, it was

named by him Anthracosia. Mr. Salter noticed that it has a wrinkled epidermis,

and considered that it was related to the Myadce, and of brackish, if not marine,

habitat. This is the shell composing the so-called 'mussel bands' and 'Unio

bands ' of the Coal-measures.
     Anthracomya, ' Iron-ores,' &c., page 229. Mr. Salter indicates that the shells

which he describes under this name have oscillated in catalogues between Avicula,
Modiola, and Unio, and that it has a wrinkled epidermis, like the foregoing.

     Anthracoptera - is a triangular shell, "ndth wrinkled epidermis, and belonging
to the same group as the above.

All the forms of this charactei-istic group of Coal-measure shells are called

Naiadites by Dawson,' and regarded by him as allied to D'Orbigny's Byssomwdonta.

Giimbel    and  Geinitz have described them as                                                 belonging to       Unio and Anodon                                                                                     and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

Ludwig refers Anthracoptera to Dreissena. At all events there is a great prob-

ability of their not being truly marine. They ma)^ have lived in the brackish vi'ater of

lagoons and creeks in the black, muddy swamps, having some communication with

the sea, and often or occasionally inundated with saltwater. (Dawson, Salter, &c.)
    Spirorbis carbo7iarius is frequent in the Coal-measures of South Wales and else-

where. This little annelid, though belonging to a marine geuus, is often found

attached to plant fragments in the coal-sbales. These plants may have hung down
into the water and been infested by the annelid ; or it may have attached itself to
floating plants which were ultimately drifted back to the littoral mud-swamp.
This Spirorbis is an important constituent in the Ardwlck limestone of Manchester
and Shropshire, but is associated with Ostracoda (Carbonia), which are probably

of brackish-water habitat.

    The Brachiopoda are necessarily marine. The lish are not good witnesses, for
they might have migrated to and fro, as some now inhabit both fresh and salt
waters ; and some might have been essentiallj' estuarine.

     Thus there are few decidedly marine beds in this series, and these, of course,

correspond with the occasional domination of the sea during its inroads and during

extreme depressions of the district.

    In addition to the occurrences of fossils in Salter's list above quoted we may

notice that in the ' Geol. Mag.,' 1870, pp. 214-220, is an account of some fossils

discovered by the late Mr. W. Adams, of Cardiff", in 1869, in a 'Black Band ' in

the Rhymney Valley, about 800 feet higher in the Coal-measures of South Wales

than any hitherto found. The band is calculated to have been rightly 81 feet above
the Mynyddysllwyn coal, from which it is divided by a fault ; it is in five layers,
and about 8 feet thick, with its associated shales. One of these in its midst and
the lowest shale carry the fossils. With some plant remains there is Anthracomya,

with Estheria (?) Adamsii, E. tenella, and Leaia Leidyi, all probably of brackish
habitats ; also Carbonia Evelincp- and C. Aynes, Ostracodes typical of a genus which

is found in the black shales, presumably of either fresh- or brackish-wat«r origin.

Mr. Adams also found a shale full of Anthracmnya at Aberbeeg, Ebbw Vale, over-

lying the Troed-rhiw-Clawdd coal, and 226 yards below the Mynyddysllwyn coal

(p. 215).

  --2. Of the Vertebrata the fishes enumerated in Mr. Salter's list are important.

The following are the genera named : Megalichthys, Ilhizodus, Pleuracanthus,

Byssacanthus (?), Pahieoniscus, Amblypterus, Ilelodus, and Pueciiodus.
     Although reptilian remains are rare in South Wales, yet they are not altogether

wanting. In 1865 ' Professor (now Sir Richard) Owen described some remains of a

small amphibian (between newt and lizard), found by the late J. E. Lee in the

lower part of the Middle (or upper part of the Lower) Coal-measures at Llan-

trissant, Glamorganshire. The animal was rather larger than the .allied Dendrer-
peton Acadianum, and Professor Owen named it Anthrakerpeton crassosteuni, 'the

thick-boned coal-reptile.' This paper and its illustrations were reproduced in the

' Trans. Cardiff Nat. Soc'

  --10, Extent of the Coal-measures under the South of Em/land. Sir H. De la

Beche in 1840 - noted that a great sheet of pakeozoic rocks, including the Coal-

measures, extending from Belgium to Central England, had been rolled about,

undulated, crumpled, and then partially worn away before the New Red Sand-

atone and other Mesozoic strata  were  laid  down  upon  them                             and                           that  these, in
                                                                                       ;

their turn, had been denuded so as to expose here and there portions of the under-

lying Coal-measures, though near by a ridge of profitless Mountain-limestone or

other older rock might come to the surface.

In 1856 Mr. Godwin-Austen, following up his reasoning about the areas of

coal-growth (see above, page 617), explained that the movements of disturbance

which they have undergone had tended to preserve the great Franco-Belgian coal-

band, and had rendered it available ; and he proceeded to state that the course of

that band of Coal-measures may be traceable westward, and probably coincided

with, and may some day be reached along the line of, the Valley of the Thames.

Professor Prestwicli in 1871 extended this inquiry;^ and, having carefully

compared the coal-beds of Somerset and Belgium, described the characters and

relations of the strata in detail, and showed that the coal might be met with at a

workable distance from the surface along a narrow but interrupted curved area

from Westphalia,  through  Belgium     and France, to    England                                                        then along  the
                                                                                                                     ;

north-eastern part of Kent (Isle of Thanet, &c.), and through Herts, Bucks,

Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire, to the Bristol coal-field, and on to South Wales.

The coincident axis of disturbance is south of the river Thames, in his opinion

throwing off the coal-beds on its northern flank.

W.Mr.  Galloway has given in the ' Cardiff Nat. Soc. Report,' vol. xvii. 1856,

Ap. 23, a sketch of the views here alluded to.     full account of the history and

literature of the question of the underground range of the older rocks in the South-

east of England, especially as to the possible occurrence of the Coal-measures, is
published in the ' Memoirs of the Geological Survev : The Geologvof London and

of Part of the Thames Valley,' vol. i., 1889, pp. 13-28, by Mr. AVhitaker, F.R.S.,

who, having given close attention to this subject, has suggested the following
localities as likely sites in the search for coal in the South-east of England :
St. Margaret's, Cliartham, Chatham, and Shoreham, all in Kent; Bushey (Herts),

Loughton (Essex), and Coombs, near Stowmarket (Suflx)lk).''

An interesting fact relating to this matter is that in February 1890 the engineer

of a boring at the foot of Shakespear's Clitf, Dover, announced that at 1,204- feet

below the surface there a thin seam of coal was met with, and at several yards
lower down coal eight feet thick was pierced, associated with clays, grits, and

blackish shales. (Newspapers.) Dr. Blanford, in his 'Anniversary Address to the
Geological Society 'on February 21, 1890, stated that Professor Boyd Dawkins,
in a letter received the day before, had informed him that a coal-seam had really

'been reached at a depth of 1,180 feet, and that this seam is proved to be of Car-
boniferous age by the plant-fossils in the associated clays. . . . The discovery is solely

the result of scientific induction, and arrived at by following tlie line of research first

indicated, I believe, by the late Mr. Godwin-Austen and subsequently by Professor

Prestwich.' The boring was undertaken with the advice of Professor W. Boyd
Dawkins ; ' and wo learn, from his latest Report,'- that the Coal-measures were

reached at 1,113 feet below high-water mark, and were penetrated to 1,500 feet;

also that in the 387 feet of Coal-measures six seams were met with, givino- an

aggregate of 10 feet of coal. The distance of the Coal-measures below high-water
mark is a near approximation to Professor Prestwich's computation of the probable
depth at which coal might be found in that part of Kent, namely, 1,000 to 1,100
feet.' The account of the coal-plants or other fossils from these "beds has not yet

been published.

  --11. Conclusion. The formation and subsequent arrangement of coal and the

Coal-measures have been so ordered that the blessings of civilisation have been
largely enjoyed wherever the fossil fuel at man's feet has been industriously
worked by his hands, and carefully applied to the improvement of his social
being. These labours of careful perseverance, and arts of skilful manipulation,

have given special characters to those whose energies have been directed to coal-

mining and various manufacturing enterprises                                                                                                                                                                                                                   and all  conditions  of society have
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

been influenced thereby.

So also the geologist, chemist, and botanist, seeking out the composition of the

various coals, their local position and extent, their special natural history, the

--mode of passage from dead plants to first-rate fuel in fact, aiming at a complete

mastery over all the mazy events and complicated results of the coal-formation

not only find a useful exercise of their cultivated intelligence and accumulated

knowledge, benefiting all by the practical results, but they widen the mental

culture of others, and sliow how the study of nature is an indispensable element

in good education, and necessarily productive of lasting benefit to society at large.

    Light, heat, motion, fragrance, and colour ai-e all now obtainable from coal.
What more coidd the sun himself do for us ? It is as if the sunshine that

cherished the luxuriant jungles of the past had been preserved in the coaly mass of

the buried trees. Indeed, the light and heat of former days, expended in thus con-

verting carbonic acid and water into coal, are here stored up for man. By

converting coal into carbonic acid and water he can again evolve tliat heat and

--light, and use them in a thousand ways beneficial to his race nay, essential to his

W.i-ery existence as a civilised being. (J.  Salter and others.)

Nevertheless, a great deal has yet to be learnt about the natural history of

the Coal-measures, the order and extent of the special kinds of their animals and

plants, the time occupied in formation, and the geographical and hydrographical

conditions. At all events, we know that all their strata have been arranged in

order, have been buried under circumstances favourable to production of the

various coaly fuels, and then turned up in orderly disorder, ready to the hand of
man, and well adapted for his use in this passage-stage of his civilisation and
development, helping him, when intelligent, active, careful, and persevering, to
higher ends. For we cannot doubt that all things here are arranged for his

better being, his progress towards more and more useful ai-ts, wider ranges of

science, and fitter aptitudes of life, of which as yet we have but little conception.

We are still the early settlers in a beautiful world, whose capabilities, imperfectly

known as yet, wait until higher developments of man can understand them fully,

and apply the results to the general good.

The following Papers and Reports were read :

          1. Discovery of the Olenellus-zowe in the North-west Highlands.

By Sir Archibald Geikie, F.B.8., Director- Oeneral of the Geological Survey.

Ever since tlie Geological Survey began the detailed investigation of the

structure of the North-west Highlands of Scotland the attention of its officers has

been continuously given to the detection of any fossil evidence that would more

clearly fix the geological horizons of the various sedimentary formations which
Aoverlie the Lewisian gneiss.
                               large collection of organic remains has been made

from the Durness Limestone, but it has not yet yielded materials for a satisfactory

stratigraphical correlation. The study of this collection, however, has confirmed

and extended Salter's original sagacious inference that the fauna of the Durness

limestone shows a marked North American fades, though, according to our present
terminology, we place this fauna in the Cambrian rather than in the SOurian

system. Below the Durness Limestone lies the doloniitic and calcareous shaly
group known as the ' Fucoid beds/ which, though crowded with worm-castings,

has hitherto proved singularly devoid of other recognisable organic remains. In

following this group southwards through the Dundonnell Forest, in the west of

Eoss-shire, my colleague, Mr. John Home, found that, a few feet below where its

upper limit is marked by the persistent band of ' Serpulite grit,' it includes a zone

of blue or almost black shales. During a recent visit to him on his ground, when

he pointed out to me this remarkable zone, I was struck with the singularly

unaltered character of these shales, and agreed with him that, if fossils were to be

looked for anywhere among these aucient rocks, they should be found here, and

that the fossil-collector, Mr. ArtJiur Macconochie, should be directed to search the

locality with great care. The following week this exhaustive search was under-

taken, and Mr. Macconochie was soon rewarded by the discovery of a number of

fragmentary fossils, among which Mr. B. N. Peach, who was also stationed in the

district, recognised what appeared to him to be undoubtedly portions of Olenellus.

The importance of this discovery being obvious, the search was prosecuted

vigorously, until the fossiliferous band could not be followed further without

quarrying operations, which in that remote and sparsely inhabited region could not

be at that time undertaken. The specimens were at once forwarded to me, and

were placed in the hands of Messrs. Sbarman and Newton, Paleontologists of the
Geological Survey, who confirmed the reference to Olenellus. More recently

Mr. Peach and Mr. Home, in a renewed examination of the ground, have found, in

another thin seam of black shale interleaved in the 'Serpulite grit,' additional

pieces of Olenellus, including a fine head-shield with eyes complete. There may

be more than one species of this trilobite in these Ross-shire shales. The specific

determinations and descriptions will shortly be given by Mr. Peach.

The detection of Olenellus among the rocks of the North-west Highlands, and

its association with the abundant Salterella of the ' Serpulite grit,' aft'ord valuable

materials for comparison with the oldest Paleozoic rocks of other regions, parti-

cularly of North America. The ' Fucoid beds ' and ' Serpulite grit ' which inter-

vene between the quartzite below and the Durness Limestone above are now

demonstrated to belong to the lowest part of the Cambrian system. The quartz-

ites are shown to form the arenaceous base of that system, while the Durness
Limestones may be Middle or Upper Cambrian. On the other hand, the Torridon

Sandstone, which Murchison placed in the Cambrian series, can now be proved to

be of still higher antiquity. The marked unconformability which intervenes

between it and the overlying quartzite points to a long interval having elapsed

between the deposition of the two discordant formations. The Torridon Sand-

stone must therefore be pre-Cambrian. Among the 8,000 or 10,000 feet of strata

in this group of sandstones and conglomerates, there occur, especially towards the

base and the top, bands of grey and dark shales, so little altered that they may be

confidently expected somewhere to yield recognisable fossils. Already my col-

leagues have detected traces of annelids and some more obscure remains of other

organisms in these strata. These, the oldest relics of life yet known in this country,

have excited a vivid desire in the Geological Survey to discover further and more

Highlands of a pre-Cambrian fauna.

2. On some recent Work of the Geological Survey in the Archcean Gneiss
      of the North-west Highlands. By Sir Archibald Geikie, F.B.8.,

        Director-General of the Survey.

For some years past the officers of the Geological Survey have spent much

time and labour upon the investigation of the old or fundam'ental gneiss of the

North-west Highlands. They have succeeded in showing that it consists mainly

of materials which were originally of the nature of eruptive igneous rocks, but

which by a long succession of processes have acquired the complicated structures

which they now present. No evidence of anything but such eruptive rocks had

been met with until the mapping was carried into the west of Ross-shire. In that

area it had long been known that the gneiss includes some mica-schists and

limestones which were believed to be integral parts of its mass. With the

accumulated experience of their work further north my colleagues were naturally

predisposed to accept this view, and to look on even the limestones ae the result

of some crushing-down and re-formation of basic igneous rocks containing lime

silicates                                       but as they proceeded in their work  they encountered  various difficulties
                                             ;

in the acceptation of such a theoretical e.xplauation. lu particular they found

that with the mica-schist were associated quartz-schists and graphitic schists, and

that the limestone occurred iu thick and persistent bands, with included minerals

like those found in the Eastern Highlands in districts of contact metamorphism.
The microscopic examination of some of these rocks showed them to present

close affinities to certain members of the crystalline series of the Eastern and

Central Highlands, which can be recognised as consisting mainly of altered sedi-

mentary strata (Dalradian series) j-et the officers of the Survey could not
                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

separate these doubtful rocks from the surrounding gneiss. The several materials

seemed to pass in.sensibly into each other in numerous sections, which were

examined with great care. Within the presc'nt month, however, one of the

members of the staff, Mr. 0. T. Clough, who has been specially engaged in this

investigation, baa obtained what may prove to be conclusive evidence on
the subject. He has ascertained that the main bands of graphitic schist occur

evenly bedded in an acid mica-schist, in which also these graphitic layers are

distributed at intervals of an inch or less. These rocks are sharply marked ofi

from the true gneiss, though where they actually join they appear to be, as it

were, crushed along a line of intense movement. Mr. Clough and his colleagues

are at present disposed to believe that these schists are really an older series of

sediments, into which the original igneous rocks now forming the gneiss were

erupted. If they succeed in demonstrating the correctness of this inference they

will have established a fact of the greatest interest in regard to the geological

history of our oldest rocks. Already they have shown the thick masses of

Torridon sandstone to be an accumulation of sedimentary materials of pre-

Cambrian age. They will push back the geological record to a still more remote

past if they can establish the existence of a yet more ancient group of sedi-

mentary strata, among which layers of graphite and beds of limestone remain to

suggest the existence of plant and animal life.

Bassani had lately appeared (' Atti R. Accad. Sci. Napoli,' Series 2, vol. iv.,

by Bassani, the author identified teeth of Scymnvs, O.vyrhina Desori, Galeus,

Aprionodon, and probably Vhysodon, besides dermal scutes of Trygon. The

collection comprises no evidence of ganoid fishes, and most of the remains of

teleosteans are too imperfect even for generic determination. Traces of Scom-

beroids and Labroids occur, and there is evidence of a new species of the Berycoid

Holoceyitrum. Teeth of Ckrysophrys, Sargus, and other common Mediterranean

genera are abundant ; and a few detached yellow teeth represent an indeter-

quadrate bone of a Ptei'odactyl, and one imperfect propodial bone of a Plesiosaur^
discovered by Mr. Joseph Mawson, F.G.S. , in the Cretaceous Formation near
Bahia, Brazil. Though not generically determinable, the fossils are of much
interest as being the first evidence of the reptilian orders in question from the
Mesozoic deposits of South America.

 6. The Cause of Monoclinal Flexure. By A. J. Jukes-Beowne, F.G.S.

     Folds of the ordinary arch and trough type are generally ascribed to the in-

fluence of lateral pressure ; but it is not easy to see how a monoclinal flexure
which appears in section as a flexure connecting two horizontal bars of strata can
have been produced by direct lateral pressure exerted at tbe ends of the bars.

     The author suggests that monoclinal flexuring is a structure impressed upon a
horizontal series of uncompressed strata by the displacement of a subjacent mass of
faulted and flexured rocks, tbe lateral compression of the deep-seated mass result-

ing in the vertical uplift of certain portions of the ' cover.' If a series of stratified
rocks rests in a horizontal position on a mass of ancient rock, which has been com-
pressed, indurated, flexured, and faulted before the deposition of the upper series,

it is supposed that tbe lower series of rocks would give way under lateral pressure
along tbe pre-existing faults, and that the blocks which lie between upward diverg-
ing faults would be forced to move upwards, carrying with them those tracts of
the ' cover' which rest on them. It is evident that these tracts would be divided
from those resting on blocks defined by downward diverging faults by faults or

monoclinal flexures, the production of a fracture or a flexure depending partly on
the thickness and pliability of the strata forming tbe cover and partly on the
amount of local uplift. It is conceivable that tbe displacement might take place
partly by faulting and partly by flexuring, and that what was a fault near the
plane of unconformity might pass upward into a flexure.

    Tbe writer desires criticism on the above suggestion, especiallj' from those who

will have a chance of seeing the grand monoclinal flexures of the Colorado region
during the excursion of the approaching International Geological Congress.

       7. Note on an Undescribed Area of Lower Greensand, or Vectian,

               in Borsetshire. By A. J. Jukes-Browne, F.G.S.

   [Communicated by permission of the Director-General of the Geological Survey.]

   A recent examination of the ground below the escarpment of tbe Chalk in

North Dorset has revealed the existence of a tract of Vectian or Lower Greensand
which had not previously been suspected. Reference to the Geological Survey

map, Sheet 15, will show that the Gault was supposed to thin out and disappear

near Shaftesbury, so as to allow the Upper Greensand to rest directly on the

Kimmeridge Clay.  This proves to be a mistake                                                                                                                                 the  Gault is continuous  into  and

beyond the valley of the Stour. Moreover two miles south of Shaftesbury a tract

of sand emerges from beneath the Gault, and forms a terrace which for a little

distance has a separate escarpment of its own.

Near Bedchester this tract of sand is nearly half a mile wide, and thence it can

be traced to Child Okeford, on the eastern side of the Stour valley, its length being

between four and five miles.

Exposures near Bedchester show that it consists chiefly of quartz sand contain-

ing a variable amount of giauconite, some beds being yellow and consisting chiefly

of quartz, others being grey or dark green and containing a large amount of

giauconite. There is also a bed of greenish-black glauconitic clay, 2J feet thick,
consisting of dark purple clay and minute grains of dark green giauconite inti-

mately mixed together. Most of the sand is of fine grain, but there are some thin

layers of coarse sand.

So far as is yet known, and with the exception of a small exposure near Lul-

worth Cove, this is the most westerly tract of Lower Greensand in lilngland.

8. On the Continuity oj the Kellaways Beds over extended areas 'near Bedford,
     and on the Extension of the Fuller's Earth Worlcs at Wohtirn. By

     A. C. G. Cameron.

   [Communicated by permission of the Director-General of the Geological Survey.]

     In this paper further evidence is submitted from diflerent parts of the country,
of the continuity over extended areas of the Kellaways Rock above the Lower
Oxford Clay. Several fine excavations, the result of railway enterprise, have
afforded sections of these beds in places where their presence was only inferred
before. More than the usual thickness is indicated by records recently obtained
from deep sinkings and borings in the Midland districts, especiallv the Bletchley
boring of 1886-7.

     The extraordinary concretionary stones, noticed in Wiltshire by Smith as
characterising this formation, and quarried away years ago at Kellaways for road-
Stone, jut out in the Valley of the Churn, near Cirencester, and stand about in
clusters in the Valley of the Ouse at Bedford like gigantic fungi. The plane of
separation of the Upper Oxford and the Kellaways in Bedfordshire is formed by a
shelly calcareous band in contact with a shelly cap to the concretionary stones.
Where this plane is a broken one there is no development of concreted rock, and
the lowest sediment of Upper Oxford clay is loamy, passing down into Kellaways
sand. Above the calcareous band there is sometimes an indurated seam of sandy
marl, breaking into conical forms ; the product, apparently, of stalactitic infiltration.
Pits are opened at the outcrop of the Kellaways (a persistent stratum in the Ouse
Valley) and are carried down through the Lower Oxford (selenite clay), Cornbrash
and Cornbrash clay to Great Oolite limestone, which is quarried for lime-burning
the ' lam earth,' the loamy portion of the Kellaways, being mixed in the mill with
the Lower Oxford, which is dug for brickmaking. Excellent sections, showing
the above series, are to be seen.

     Observations on the extension of the Fuller's Earth Works at Woburn Sands,
with some description of the beds, are given, and the mining industry now springing
up is commented on.

FRIDAY, AUGUST 21.

The following Papers were read :

1. On the Discovery of the South-Eastern Coal-field.

      Bjj Professor W. Boyd Dawkins, F.B.S.

     The author pointed out that although the physical identity of the South-          O
Western coal-fields with those of Northern France and Belgium was recognised
hy Buckland and Conybeare as far back as 1826, it was reserved for Godwin-
Austen to point out the possibility (in 1855) and the probability (in 1858) of the
extension of the coal measures under the secondary rocks of South-Eastern,
These views were ratified by Prestwich, before the Coal Commission in 1866.
After referring to the sub-wealden boring, abandoned when carried to a depth
of 1,904 feet, the author stated that in 1886 he recommended to Sir E. Watkin
that a boring should be made on the site of the Channel Tunnel works, almost
in sight of Calais, where the coal measures had been reached at 1,104 feet, and
near the spot where about four hundredweight of bituminous material, possibly
derived from the coal measures below, had been found in the chalk. Professor
Prestwich had pointed out in 1873 the possibility of tunnelling across the
Channel in the older rocks, and Mr. Whitaker had also pointed out in 1886 the
desirability of making trial for coal at Dover.

   A shaft was sunk on the west side of Shakespeare's Cliif to a depth of 44 feet,

and from the bottom of this a bore-hole was carried to a depth of 1,500 feet,
through the following strata : Cretaceous, 500 feet ; Jurassic, 613 feet ; Coal
measures, 387 feet. The first seam of coal was struck at 1,140 feet, and five
other seams were met with at intervals down to 1,500 feet, giving, according to

Mr. Biady, 10 feet of workable coal in all. These coal measures dipped gently af)
an angle of 2 degrees to the smrth, and are clearly within the limits at which]
mining can be carried on at a profit, for the British coal-fields are worked ta
depths of 3,000 feet, those of Belgium to 4,000 feet, and year by year the improved
means of ventilation carry the limit downwards.

     The coal is bright and blazing, with cleat shghtly lozenge-shaped, and, although
with marks of crushing in two seams, is much less injured in this respect than the
coals of the Boulonnais. Comparison with the Westphalian coal-field, which has
294 feet of workable coal, that of Liege with 212 feet, that of Mons with 250 feet,
and that of Somerset with 98 feet, suggests that the discovery of other and thicker
seams is merely a question of sinking deeper.

    In conclusion, the author pointed out the importance of a new coal industry
in the south-east of England, carrying in its train many other industries, and not
improbably reviving under more favourable conditions the ancient wealden iron-

field, while he also indicated the important bearing of these discoveries on the

question of the durability of our coal supply.

                       The Geology of Petroleum and Natural Gas.

                     By W. ToPEEY, F.B.8., Assoc.Inst.G.E.

     The object of this paper is to give a summary of some of the more important
facts as to the geological conditions under which petroleum and natural gas are
found in various parts of the world, noting the geological ages of the rocks in
which they occur, and the influence of geological structure in determining this

occurrence.

    Few cases are known in which petroleum occurs in rocks older than the Silu-

rian, and none where the amount is. of any importance..
     Petroleum occurs, but not in large quantity, in a trachyte-breccia at Taranaki,

New Zealand. In N. W. Hungary it is .found in a trachytic tuff of Sliocene age,

and in some other areas email indications of petroleum are found in volcanic
--638 BEPORT 1891.

rocks. These, however, are exceptional cases ; for in the great majority of cases

petroleum is far removed from any known indications of true volcanic action.

    The great stores of petroleum and gas in Pennsylvania and New York are in

sandstone beds of the Devonian and Lower Carboniferous* rocks. Of late years

great quantities of gas and oil have been obtained, chiefly in Ohio and Indiana,

from the Trenton Limestone (Ordovician).

    The oil- and gas-fields of Pennsylvania and New York have a very simple

geological structure. The rocks lie comparatively undisturbed, being only gently
folded into a series of anticlinals and synclinals parallel with, and along the N.W.
side of, the main axes of the AUeghanies. These folds have themselves a gentle

inclination towards the S.W. In the AUeghanies, and to the S.E. of the range,
where the rocks are greatly disturbed, neither oil nor gas is found. Some of the
larger gas wells are on or near the summits of anticlinals, but many are not so

placed. In the Trenton Limestone fields of Ohio and Indiana the productive areas

are mainly over anticlinals, gas occurring at the crown of the arch, oil on the

slopes.

  --The essential conditions for a largely productive field of gas or oil are a porous

reservoir (generally sandstone or limestone) in which the hydrocarbons can be

stored, and an impervious cover of shale retaining them in the reservoir. It is

also believed that they only occur where, in or under the porous reservoir, there
have been accumulations of fossil remains, the original decomposition of which

yielded the hydrocarbons. In the case of the sandstones the original source was

probably the fossiliferous shales which underlie them ; in the case of the Trenton
Limestone the source was probably the fossiliferous limestone itself. The lime-

stone is only productive                                under  certain circumstances                                                                                    in  its normal condition it is
                                                                                                                                                                     ;

a compact rock, and then it contains neither gas nor oil. But over large areas the

limestone has been dolomitized, and so transformed into a cavernous and porous
rock in which gas and oil are stored. The enormous quantities of gas and oil

given out from beds of limestone and sandstone can be fully accounted for when

their porous nature, thickness, and extent are taken into consideration. Some of

these rocks can contain from j^th to ^th of their bulk of oil.
     The high pressure under which gas and oil flow from deep borings can in most

cases be fully explained by artesian pressure.

In Kansas gas occurs mainly in the Lower Coal Measures. In Kentucky and

Tennessee oil is found in the Ohio shales (Up. Devonian), in Colorado in shales of

Cretaceous age. In California it is found in Tertiary strata, mostly much disturbed.
     In Canada the chief source, in Ontario, is in Devonian rocks, along a well-

marked anticlinal ; but gas and oil also occur in the Trenton Limestone. In the
North-West Territories there seem to be great stores of oil in Devonian rocks. Gas
and oil now found in Cretaceous strata of the prairies and Athabasca may have

been derived from underlying Devonian rocks ; but in the Rocky Mountains, at
Crow's Nest Pass, oil is probably native to the Cretaceous beds.

     In Mexico, tlie West Indies, and parts of South America, Tertiary strata seem

to be the chief source of oil. The age of the petroleum-bearing unfossiliferous

sands, &c., of the Argentine Republic (province of Jujuy) is not certainly known;
they have been referred by diil'erent writers to various ages from Silurian to

Tertiary                                          they are probably sub- Cretaceous.  In Europe and Asia the petroleum-

bearing beds are of Secondary or Tertiary age, the Palaeozoic rocks yielding only

an insignificant supply.

In North-west Germany we find petroleum in the Keuper Beds, and more or

less in other strata up to and including the Gault. As we pass to the south and

south-east from this district we find, as a general rule, that oil occurs in newer

strata. The various productive horizons of diflerent districts are as follows :

The important districts of Baku occur on plains over anticliuals of Miocene beds.

The petroleum-bearing' sands are interstratified with impervious clays, separating

the strata into distinct productive horizons.

     In Algeria oil occurs in Lower Tertiary beds. The Egyptian petroleum comes

from Miocene strata.

    Petroleum seems to be unknown in peninsular India ; but it occurs in many
places along the flanks of the Himalayan range, and also in Lower Burma, generally
in Lower Tertiary strata. In Upper Burma and Japan the oil-bearing rocks are
probably Newer Tertiary. In all these areas the beds are greatly disturbed, and

the same  is  the  case with                                                                                      the  great  Carpathian  field                        but  it  frequently happens

that the most productive regions are along anticlinal lines.

In New Zealand oil occurs in Cretaceous and Tertiary strata.

Petroleum and gas almost universally occur associated with brine. This may

come wholly or partly from the decomposition of the animal matter which has

produced the hydrocarbons, together with the remains of the sea- water originally

present in the rocks. But the frequent occurrence of rock-salt in the neighbourhood

of petroleum-bearing districts is worthy of note.

  --Summary. The main points to be considered in respect to the geological con-

ditions under which petroleum and gas occur in quautitj' seem to be as follows :

    1. They occur in rocks of all geological ages, from Silurian upwards. The
most productive areas are Palteozoic in North America, Miocene in the Caucasus;

     2. There is no relation to true volcanic action.
     3. The most productive areas for oil in great quantity are where the strata are

comparatively undisturbed. Oil, but in less abundance, frequently occurs when

the strata are highly disturbed and contorted, but gas is rarely so found.

4. The main requisites for a productive oil- or gas-field are a porous reservoir

(sandstone or limestone) and an impervious cover.

5. Both in comparatively undisturbed and in highly disturbed areas, an anti-

clinal structure often favours the accumulation of oil and gas in the domes of the

arches.

6. Brine is an almost universal accompaniment of oil and gas.

                 3. The Origin of Petroleum} By 0. C. D. Eoss.

     In the coui'se of introductory remarks the author contends that, owing to the
mystery surrounding the origin of petroleum, and to the paucity of indications
where to seek for it, practical men in this countrj^ distrust the permanence of the

supply, and hesitate to adopt it for many useful purposes ; while the object of
this paper is to suggest a way of resolving the mystery which is calculated to
dissipate that distrust. The theories suggested by Reichenbach, Berthelot, Men-
delejeff, Virlet, Verneuil, Peckham, and others, which are briefly described, make

no attempt to account for the remarkable variety in its chemical composition, in its
specific gravity, its boiling points, &c., and are all founded on some hypothetical
process which differs from any with which we are acquainted; but modern geo-
logists are agreed that (as a rule) the records of the earth's history should be read
in accordance with those laws of Nature which contimie in force at the present

day. E.g., the decomposition of fish would not now produce paraffin oil ; hence
we can hardly believe it possible thousands, or millions, of jears ago, so long as
it can be shown that any of the ordinary processes of Nature is calculated to
produce it. The chief characteristics of petroleum strata are enumerated as : I. The

existence of adjoining beds of limestone, gypsum, &c. ; II. Volcanic action in close
proximity ; III. The presence of salt water in the wells ; IV. The great extent

of the production of oil, indicating subterranean receptacles of vast dimensions.

     I. The close and invariable proximity of limestone to the wells, has been noticed

by all writers, but they have been most impressed by its being ' fossiliferous,' or
shell limestone, and have drawn the erroneous inference that the animal matter

once contained in those shells originated petroleum, but no fish oil ever contained

paraffin. On the other hand, the fossil shells are carbonate of lime, and, as such,
capable of producing petroleum under circumstances such as many limestone beds

have been subjected to. All limestone rocks were formed under water, and are

mainly composed of calcareous shells, corals, encrinites, and foraminifera, the

latter similar to the foraminifera of * Atlantic ooze ' and of English chalk beds.

Everywhere, under the microscope, its organic origin is conspicuous. Limestone

is the most widely diffused of all rocks and contains 12 per cent, of carbon.

Petroleum consists largely of carbon, and there is a far larger accumulation of

carbon in the limestone rocks of the United Kingdom than in all the Coal-measures

Athe world contains.      range of limestone rock 100 miles in length by 10 miles in

width and 1,000 yards in depth would contain 743,000 million tons of carbon, or

sufficient to provide carbon for 875,000 million tons of petroleum. Deposits of

bituminous shale have also limestone close at hand e.g., coral-rag underlies the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

Kimmeridge clay, which is more or less saturated throughout with petroleum,

and it also underlies the famous Black-shale in Kentucky, which is extraordinarily

rich in oil.

     II. The evidence of volcanic action in close proximity to petroleum strata is

next dealt with, and extracts in proof thereof are given from several writers. In

illustration of volcanic action on carbonate of lime, a sulphur mine in Spain, within

a short distance of an extinct volcano (with which the author is well acquainted),

is mentioned. That petroleum is not far off is indicated by a perpetual gas flame

in a neighbouring chapel and other symptoms ; and, these circumstances having

attracted his attention, he observed that Dr. Christoph Bischof records in his

writings that he had produced sulphur in his own laboratory b)^ passing hot

volcanic gases through chalk, which fact further led the author to remark that,

in addition to sulphur, ethylene, and all its homologues (OnH,,n)) which are the

oils predominating at Baku, would be produced by treating

              2, 3, 4, 5  equiv. of limestone (carbonate of lime) with

These and all their homologues would be produced in nature by the action of

volcanic gases on limestone.

    But much the most abundant of the volcanic gases appears (at any rate at the

by H^O (steam), or H^O" (peroxide of hydrogen), which is the product that results

     Four tables are given at the end of the paper, showing the formulae for the
homologuesof ethylene and marsh gas resulting from the increase in regular grada-

tion of the same constituents.
     It is explained that these effects must have occurred, not at periods of acute

volcanic eruptions, but in- conditions which may be and have been observed at the

j)resent time wherever there are active solfataras, or furaaroles, at work. Descrip-
tions of the action of solfataras by the late Sir Richard Burton and a British
Consul in Iceland are quoted, also a paragraph from Lyell's ' Principles of Geology,'
in which he says that the mud-volcanoes at Girgenti, in_ the Tertiary limestone

formation, * are' known to have been casting out water, mixed with mud and bitu-

men, with the same activity for the last fifteen centuries.' Probably at all these
.salfataras, if the gases traverse limestone, fresh deposits of oil-bearing strata are
accumulating ; and how much may there not have been produced during fifteen

centuries

     Gypsum may also be an indication of oil-bearing strata, for the substitution
in limestone of sulphuric for carbonic acid can only be accounted for by the action
of these sulphurous gases. The abundance of gypsum in the United Kingdom
indicates that large volumes of petroleum are probably stored in places where it
has never yet been sought for. Gypsum is found extensively in the petroleum
districts of the United States, and It underlies the rock-salt beds of Middlesboro'
(N.E. Yorkshire), where, on being pierced, it has given passage to oil-gas, which

--issues abundantly mixed with brine, and uuder great pressure from a great deptli.
     III. and IV. Besides the space occupied by 'natural gas,' 17,000 million
gallons of petroleum have been raised in America since 1860, and that quantity-

must have occupied 100,000,000 cubic yards ; a space equal to a subterranean cavern
100 yards wide by twenty feet high and eighty-two miles in length, and it is
suggested that beds of ' porous sandstone ' could hardly find room for so much

while vast receptacles may exist, carved by water out of former beds of rock-salt

adjoining the limestone.

     This would account for the brine ; and the increase to the molecular volume of

the gases consequent thereon would in part account for the pressure. It is further

suggested that when no such open spaces were available, the hydrocarbon vapours

were absorbed hito and condensed in contiguous clays and shales, and perhaps

also in beds of coal, only partially consolidated at the time. There is an extensive

hituminous limestone formation in Persia, containing 20 per              cent,        of  bitumen                                           and

the theory elaborated in the paper would account for bitumen and oil having

been found in Canada and Tennessee imbedded in limestone, which fact Mr.

Peckham (in his article on Petroleum in the ' Encyclopedia Brit.,' 9th edition)

thought was a corroboration of his belief that some petroleums are a ' product of

the decomposition of animal remains.'

    Above all, this theory accounts for the many varieties in the chemical compo-

sition of paraffin oils, in accordance with ordinary operations of Nature during

successive geological periods.

A4. Comparison hetween the Blocks of South Pembrolieshire and those of

    North Devon. By Henry Hicks, M.B., F.B.S., Sec. Oeol. Soc.

     The clear succession from the Silurian rocks to the Carboniferous to be observed

in many sections in South Pembrokeshire offers, in the author's opinion, the key to

the true interpretation of the succession in the rocks of North Devon, for there

     1891.                                                                                TT

cannot he a doubt that the post-Carboniferous earth-movements which so power-

fully affected and folded the beds in North Devon extended into and produced

almost identical results in South Pembrokeshire. In the latter area, however, the

succession remains clearer, and can be traced more continuously.

The base of the Silurian (Upper Silurian of Survey) is exposed at many

points, and the lower beds, usually conglomerates, repose transgressively on the

Ordovician, and even on some pre-Cambrian rocks. Near Johnston and Stoney

Slade the conglomerate contains numerous pebbles of the Johnston and Great Hill

granite as well as of other igneous masses which were formerly supposed to be
intrusive in these beds. From the Silurian conglomerate to the Carboniferous beds

there does not appear to be any evidence of a very marked break in the series ; more-

over, all these beds were folded together and suffered equally by the movements

which affected the area. The axes of the folds strike from about W.N.W. to

E.S.E. The movements, therefore, at this time were in a nearly opposite direction

to those which affected the Ordovician and Cambrian rocks at the close of the

Ordovician period. Within the broken anticlinal folds portions of the old land

surfaces have been exposed in several places by denudation.

The succession exposed in this area and the effects produced by the earth-move-

ments so nearly resemble those already described by the author as occurring in

North Devon, that he is convinced that the beds must have been deposited con-

temporaneously in one continuous subsiding area, and that the differences recognis-

able are chiefly in the basal beds, which were deposited on an uneven land surface.

He believes that the Morte slates of North Devon are a portion of an old land

surface on which the so-called Devonian rocks were deposited, and he also believes

that the Devonian rocks are only the representatives in Devonshire of the Lower

Carboniferous, Old Ked Sandstone (and possibly of some of the Silurian rocks), of

APembrokeshire.  critical examination of the fossil evidence tends strongly to con-

firm this view.

     5. Vulcanicity in Loiver Devonian Roclcs. The Pratule Prohlem.

                        ByW. A. E. UssHEE, F.G.S.

   [Communicated by permission of the Director-General of the Geological Survey.]

     In the area extending south from the Middle Devonian volcanic series of
Ashprington to the Prawle there appears to be no proof of the occurrence of strata
older than Lower Devonian. There is no adequate reason for assuming that Lower
Devonian rocks as old as the Gedinnian occur on the surface, and there is no
certainty that the lowest beds are older than the Lower Coblenzian.

     The occurrence of local volcanic action in Lower Devonian time is proved
by a series of diabases and tuffs near Dartmouth, in the Kingswear Promontory,
near Stoke Fleming, and in the line of country west from Torcross.

     In association with the northern chloritic band (running from the mouth of
the valley on the north of Hall Sands on the east to Hope on the west) we find
volcanic materials identical in character with varieties of volcanic rocks associated
with the Devonian slates in the line of country west from Torcross ; and here and
there in the line of country west from Torcross the volcanic rocks assume a more
or less pronounced chloritic aspect. The junction of the slates on the north with
the northern chloritic band is a strictly normal one, the chloritic rocks being
almost invariably separated from the slates by brown volcanic materials which are
everywhere succeeded by the same type of Devonian slate, and in the Southpool
Creek and many other sections are found to pass insensibly into the chloritic type.
In the Southpool Creek section a hard bluish diabase (? aphanite) occurs in the
chloritic band. In the southern chloritic districts of the Prawle the volcanic rocks
maj' still be here and there detected by texture or colour. Volcanic rocks occur in
the mica schists of the Start coast, and can be detected even when only a few
inches in thickness. At Spirit-of-the-Ocean Cove chloritic rock with much calc-
spar occurs in association with tuffs and a grey rock with incipient foliation, pre-
senting a slightly gneissoid appearance, and apparently a much sheared diabase.
The association of the chloritic rocks with the mica schists is of as intimate a
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  643

nature as that of tlie \'olcai:ic materials with the unaltered slates to the north.
From these facts it seems evident that the chloritic series is nothinjy more than a
Devonian volcanic group, of which the Torcross, Stoke Fleming, Dartmouth, and
Kingswear coast tuii's and diabases were either sporadic otishoots or evidences of
more or less contemporaneous local vulcanicity.

     The more evident crinlsling of the mica schists in contact with the chloritic
group seems to be due to their comparative softness and greater fissility during the
crumpling and contraction to which both were subjected.

     The comparative suddenness of the transition from unaltered to more or less
highly altered rocks may be explained by the lessening of strain (in receding from
the harder masses of ancient rocks, against which the beds were jammed), being
coincident with the thinning out of the volcanic materials northward, and further-
more favoured by the soft character of the grey slates with limonitic interfilmings
which evexywhere bound the northern chloritic band on the north. It is not the
author's present purpose to enter more particularly into the stratigraphy of this
interesting region, which is not yet thoroughly worked out. It only remains to

acknowledge the prior claim of Mr. Somervail to the suggestion of the identity of

the Devonian diabases with the chloritic rocks.^

6. On the Occurrence of Detrital Tourmaline in a Quartz-scliist ivest of
          Start Point, South Devon. By A. R. Hunt, M.A., F.G.S.

     While examining the Devonian clift's near Street Gate, at the north-east end of

Slapton Sands, South Devon, in company with Mr. W. A. E. Ussher, F.G.S. , the

author selected a hard micaceous sandstone of fine grain, occurring as a band
between softer rocks, for comparison with a micaceous quartzite or quartz-schist,
previously noticed by Mr. Ussher at a point on the coast south of Start Fai-m and
west of Start Lighthouse. The quartz-schist occurs as an impersisteut band among
the mica-schists west of Start Point.

     Mr. A. Harker, F.G.S., on examining the sandstone, at once pointed out the
presence of tourmaline and white mica, of detrital origin ; and considered that the
rock had the appearance of having been derived from a tourmaline-bearing granite.

    On a careful examination of two slides of the quartz-schist,- the author detected

a single grain of tourmaline. Six additional slides were forthwith prepared, and
detrital tourmaline was found in them all. One of these slides contains a pellucid
grain of quartz with fluid inclusions and active bubbles ; another contains a grain
crowded with hair-like inclusions and with one fluid inclusion whose bubble is
easily moved by the heat of a wax match. Both these grains could be easily
matched in the quartzes of different granites.

     The derivation of the quartz-schist from granites of more than one character,
but one of which must have been schorlaceous, seems clearly indicated.

     The above facts have two distmct bearings, viz., as to the age of the meta-
morphic schists of South Devon, and as to the derivation of the tourmaline.

     The two rocks under consideration, viz., the quartz-schist and the Devonian
sandstone, are related to each other in four particulars, insomuch as they contain
four constituents common to both, viz., detrital tourmaline, detrital mica, quartz
of fine grain, and iron.

     It seems difficult to avoid the conclusion that such similar rocks must be of
like age and derivation ; and that as the sandstone is undoubtedly Devonian, the
quartz -schist, one of the metamorphic schists of South Devon, must be of Devonian
age also, and not Archaean, as has been supposed by some geologists.

   The derivation of the tourmaline is a more difficult question. Whatever may
be the age of the mass of the Dartmoor granites, those of a schorlaceous character

seem to be post-Carboniferous. Moreover, no tourmaline has been noticed in the

     ' The views above expressed are those to which the author himself has been led,

granites trawled in the English Channel. There is thus no recognised source of
pre-Deyonian tourmaline in the neighbourhood of South Devon, yet the source of
derivation of the rocks under discussion could not seemingly he remote, or the
tourmaline, quartz, and mica could scarcely have kept together. The tourmaUne
granites of Cornwall would meet the case, if any of these are of pre-Devonian age

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

but on this point the author has no information.

     Besides the tourmaline observed in the rocks at Street Gate and Start Point,
the author has noticed the same mineral, occurring in the same way, in a sandstone
from near Tinsey Head in Start Bay, and in a sandstone from near Charleton, on
the Kingsbridge estuary, both of Devonian age.

        Survey.

This minute crustacean was first discovered by the Rev. P. B. Brodie, F.G.S.,

in the Rhretic, at Wainlode Cliff, Gloucestershire,' and was named after him by
Professor Rupert Joucb. It was afterwards found in a band of fine sandstone

occurring in the Keuper marls, at several localities in the Midland counties. Still
later it was discovered in tlie Letten Kohl of the Baden Trias, which is the lowest
horizon of the German Keuper.

     In September of last year I discovered a small assemblage of these shells in
the lowest member of the Cheshire Keuper, viz. the Lower Keuper building

stones                           they occurred in a pebble                  of marl,  of a deep purple  colour, enclosed     in  a

pale yellow sandstone, at Broadhurst's quarry, Alderley Edge. The majority of the
specimens are now in the British and Jermy'n Street Museums, and they have been

described by our President, Professor Rupert Jones, in the ' Geological Magazine.'

I have failed to find any more, after the most careful search.

     It is worthy of note that the oldest-known mammal, Microlestes Moorp.i, Owen,
occurs in the German Letten Kohl ; but in England, where it was discovered by
Mr. Charles Moore in 1858, it is not known below the Rhajtic. The small mammal,

and the minute crustacean, occurring both above and below the Keuper marls,

may it not be hoped that the mammal may also be found in England, and support

the views of the late Professor Forbes, that the beds now called Rhaetic are really

           4. Notes 7ipon Colobodus, a Genus of Mesozoic Fossil Fishes.

                        By Montagu Browne, F.Z.8., F.G.S.

     Colobodus appears to have been first constituted a genus in the vear 18.37 by
Louis Agassiz (see 'Poissons Fossiles,' Tome II., ii^ partie, p. 237), who gave this
name to some Lqndofits-Yike teeth {Colobodus hoyardi) from the Muschelkalk,
TIIANSACIIONS OF SECTION C.  645

--·which he described thus: 'Par leur taille elles tienneiit le milieu entre les

Microdon et les Sphserodus. De formes arrondies et cylindracoes vers la base, les

dents ont leur courouue renflee en forme de massue, et siir le milieu de la couronne

s'(5leve encore un petit mammelon tronqu^, ce qui a valu Ti ce genre son nom de

Colobodus.''

     Since that time teeth of a similar generic character have been described or
figured by various authors, e.g. Count Miinster (assuminp; Asterodon to be identical),
Plieninger, Giebel, Gervais, Meyer, Chop, E. E. Schmid, Alberti, Eck, Winkler,

Giirich, W. Dames, and A. S. Woodward. The typical teeth, however i.e. those

--upon which the ' nipple,' or apical tubercle, is present must be sought amongst

the various species of Colobodus and Lepidotus (of Plieninger, 1847) ; whilst inter-
mediate forms, or those from which the 'nipple' has been partly or entirely
removed by wearing or by post-mortem abrasion, must be sought amongst those
described under the various species of Lepidotus, Sphccrodus, Gyrodus, ' Tetra-
gonolepis ' (of Winkler, and of Agassiz in part), Tholodus and Thelodus, Supleu-
rodus, Sargodon (not cutting teeth), and even amongst teeth variously attributed
to Saurichthys and to ' Saurians,' whilst the chisel- shaped, or pre-m axillary, teeth
are probably those attributed to Sargodon tomicus.

     Fragments of the head and trunk and scales of Colobodus have been described
or figured by II. B. Geinitz, Meyer and Plieninger, Giebel, Meyer, Quenstedt, Eck,

Kner, H. Kunisch, W. Dames, J. von Rohon, and A. S. Woodward, and must be

sought amongst the various species ascribed to Gyrolepis and Amblyptcrus, Lepi-
dotus, Heterolepidotus, Eugnathus, Pleurolepis, Dactylolepis, and also amongst
various Ganoid scales (' Ganoidschuppen ' and ' Fischschuppen ').

    Up to the present neither the teeth nor the scales of Colobodus have been recog-

nised as such in Britain by any authors, or, above the Muschelkalk and Lettenkohle,
abroad: its occurrence and recognition, therefore, in the Rhfetic of Britain is
interesting, and the author exhibited typical and transitional teeth which he found
and recognised in the Rhjetic 'bone-beds' of Watchet and Aust Cliff; worn and
abraded teeth (' Sargodon tomicus ' and ' Sphcerodus ') from thence and from
Leicestershire ; and what are probably the larger cutting teeth from Aust and
Leicestershire ; also line characteristic scales and (.'' head-) bones showing vermicu-
lated sculpture from Aust. All may, for the present, be referred to Colobodus

maxinius (Quenstedt)

      Finally, should Colobodus prove to be identical with Lepidotus, a further fusion
of Heterolepidotus and Eugnathus will give Colobodus a more extended upward
range than has hitherto been supposed.

         1. The Cause of an Ice Age. By Sir Robert Ball, F.B.S.

    The ordinary statement of the astronomical theory of the Ice Age seems to be
founded on a passage in Sir John Herschel's outlines of Astronomy. It is from
this that Dr. CroU's theory has been developed. It is the object of this communi-
cation to point out that by what seems to have been a mathematical mistake on
the part of Herschel, a wholly erroneous statement of the matter was presented.
646 EEPOET--1891.

The error was not perceived by Croll. lie, perhaps not unnaturally, accepted
Herschel's authority on such a matter, and consequently a thorough revision of

Croll's calculations and his doctrines based thereon becomes necessary.
    In a work now in the press, bearing the title of this paper, I have endeavoured

to develop the correct view of the subject, and to rewrite the astronomical theory
of the Ice Age. I may, however, here remark that the error into which Dr. Croll
unfortunately fell was very prejudicial to the conclusion he strove to prove.

Had he been acquainted with the accurate version of the mathematical facts, he
would have been able to show a much stronger case for the astronomical doctrine
of the Ice Age than that he actually presented.

the earth in a year, then Go will be the share received during summer, and 37

during winter.

   A special importance attaches to these figures from the circumstance that they

are absolutely independent of the eccentricity of the earth's orbit, or of the position

of the equinoxes. They depend solely upon the obliquity of the ecliptic, and this
is a magnitude which, so far as our present purpose is concerned, maybe regarded

as constant during geological time.

    The distribution of the heat just stated is the point which I now desire to

emphasise. Herschel stated the uumbers to be 50 and 50. If his attention had

been sufficiently given to the matter, he would have seen that the numbers were
63 and 37. The correction is an important one.

    It is to be remembered that the units in which we are reckoning express the
total heat received from the sun. As the sun heat alone preserves the earth

from sinking to the temperatiu'e of space, it follows that the sun heat really main-

tains a temperature some hundreds of degrees greater than we would otherwise

Ahave.  fluctuation in sun heat, which appeared small in comparison with the

total amount, might involve a vast change in climate.

Owing to the perturbations of the planets, it will occasionally happen that the

eccentricity of the earth's orbit will become larger than it is at present. It seems

that the maximum eccentricity is sufficient to produce an inequality between the

Weduration of summer and winter amounting to 33 days.  have, therefore, the

following possible conditions in either northern or southern hemisphere :

Summer . . . .109 days. , Summer . . . .166 days.
Winter . . . .166 days. ^"^ Winter . . . .199 days.

     In each case it must be borne in mind that G3 heat-units arrive in summer
and 37 in winter. If the summer be the long one and the winter be short, then
the allotment of heat between the two seasons is fairly adjusted. The (J3 units
are distributed over the 199 days, and the 37 units over 166 days, and a milder

climate than our present one results. This is the genial inter-glacial state for that

hemisphere. If, however, a torrent of heat represented by 63 units is received
during a brief summer of 166 days, while the balance of '37 units is made to
stretch itself over 199 days, then a brief and intensely hot summer is followed by

a very long and cold winter. As this condition lasts for many centuries it seems

sufficient to produce a glacial epoch.

     I have only to add that on this view there must have been not only one but
several Glacial epochs throughout geological time, but they doubtless occurred at
very irregular intervals, and with wide differences in severity. It is, however,
noteworthy that the theory requires that when the northern hemisphere is glaciated
the southern hemisphere shall be in a genial state, and vice versa. It is also to
be observed that so long as the high eccentricity of the earth's orbit is maintained
the procession of the equinoxes will cause the glaciation to shift from one hemi-
sphere to another in a period of 10,500 (ten thousand five hundred) years. I do
not mean that this will always be the interval, but it does seem probable that
there may be clusters of two, three, or more ice ages, the individual members of
which are so divided. Each cluster is separated from the next by a vast period

of hundreds of thousands of years. There is no means, so far as I at present
know, of indicating the law of recurrence of ice ages with any further accuracy of

detail.

     I wou'd also like to say that while I have here striven to enunciate with

precision the astronomical aspect of the prohlem, I am profoundly conscious of
the many geological agents which may contribute to modify the eU'ects of which
I am treating.

3. Notes on the Glacial Gcologij of Norway. B>/ H. W. Crossket, LL.D.^

                                                      F.O.S.

    Attention was called to a passage in the standard work on ' Norway and its
Glaciers ' by Forbes, p. 24, in which it is stated that they are questionable traces of
glaciers on the Dovre-fjeld, and that nothing decisive of their action, either by

wearing and polishing the rocks where they come into view or in the deposition

of glaciers, could be seen. 'Nor are the mounds of stone (it is added), which are

abundant enough, sufficiently characteristic to deserve the appellation of moraines.

They are indeed sometimes disposed in flat-topped ridges ; but this is due, if I

mistake not, to the eroding action of torrents, which have gradually undermined

them, leaving abrupt talus, which at first resemble moraines, but in their present

form it is diificult or impossible to identify them.'

     Since the time of Forbes the deposits of the Glacial epoch have been studied in

greater detail, and it is now possible to assign to their proper places and causes
many deposits which it has previously been regarded as impossible to identify.
The description given of the Dovre-fjeld needs many corrections and additions.

The plateau is hidden to a considerable extent by a rough layer of stony material,
but wherever the basement rock is exposed glaciation may be found. The mounds

that are alluded to by Forbes are related to the action of ice among the mountains

which bound the Dovre-fjeld. The glaciers in the valleys of those mountains

·descended over the Dovre-fjeld, and accumulated their moraines upon it, and
the mounds are the relics of lateral glaciers. As the snows melted, torrents
of water were poured down from the surrounding mountains over the Dovre-
fjeld, larger lakes than those now existing were formed within any hollows and

within the boundaries of morainic dams.

As the climate ameliorated the snows lessened, and the torrents of water were

less excessive ; but streams and rivers abounded, connecting the diminished lakes.
Owing to these processes, the moraines were swept away to a large extent, only

small mounds being left, and their material was distributed over the surface of

the plateau. Angular blocks were roimded, and glaciated surfaces buried beneath

the debris.

--In the deposits of the Dovre-fjeld there is thus every proof (1) of a period of
extreme glaciation                                                                          (2) of the existence of glaciers descending from lateral valleys
                                                                                         ;

in the surrounding mountains                                                                                                  (3) of the gradual  disappearance  of  these glaciers
                                                                                                                           ;

and the washing of their moraines over the general surface of the fjeld.

Not a few erratic ice-worn blocks also occur, although in many cases they

have been water-worn during the course of the history described.

4. Recent Discoveries concerning the Relation of the Glacial Period in North

      America to the Antiquity of Man. By Professor G. Fredekick
       Weight, F.G.8A., LL.D., Oberlin, Ohio, U.S.A.

     Palaeolithic implements of the type of those found in the high-level gravel of

the Valley of the Somme, and of various streams of Southern England, have now

--been found in similar gra vel deposits in no less than aoveu different places in the

United States namely at Trenton, New Jersey, by Dr. C. C. Abbott ; at
648 UEPORT-- 1891.

Claymont, Delaware, by Dr. II. T. Cresson ; at Newcomerstown, Ohio, by Mr.

W. C. Mills ; at Loveland and Madisonville, Ohio, by Dr. M. C. Metz ; at Medora,

Indiana, by Dr. Cresson ; and at Little Falls, Minnesota, by Miss Babbitt. The

determination of the age of these implements requires a general study of the Glacial

phenomena of the continent.

Through the combined labours of many observers, the southern boundary of

the glaciated region has been carefully traced across the continent, and found to

run in an irregular course from the vicinity of New York City, south-westward

through Cincinnati in Ohio, to Carbondale, about latitude 38°, in southern Illinois,

Thence it bears north-westward, following approximately the course of the Mis-

souri River, and entering Canada a hundred miles or mora east of the Rocky

Mountains. The centre of radiation for this portion of the ice-lield was in the

vicinity of the south-east of Hudson Bay, and this portion has been named the

Laurentide glacier. From that centre the ice movement was west and north, as

well as east and south.

Whether the Laurentide glacier became confluent on the west with the

Cordilleran glacier, which occupied the vast region in British Columbia west of

the Rocky Mountains, is still in dispute. But it is certain that the ice from that

centre, as well as in the mountains of southern Alaska, moved outward in all

directions. The glaciation of the Rocky Mountains, and of the Cascade Range

south of the Canadian boundary, was comparatively slight.

The distribution of ice during the Glacial period in Xorth America bears

strongly against all theories which attribute the phenomena to cosmical causes.

There was not a Polar ice-cap, but an accumulation about centres mainly south of

the Arctic Circle. While there is accumulating evidence pointing to an extensive

elevation of the glaciated areas during the latter part of the Tertiary period, and

of a subsidence at the same time of the Isthmus of Panama. The valleys occupied

by the great lakes were probably mainly formed by erosion during that period

of elevation, the old lines of drainage having been closed up by the debris of the

Glacial period. This is clearly the case with Lake Erie, and, to a large extent,
may be the case with the other lakes. There are positive signs of such old
channels, now buried, leading to the Mississippi from Lake 3Iichigan, and to the

Hudson from Lake Ontario.

     The Palicolithic implements discovered in North America are from the terraces

--of streams flowing outward from the glaciated region namely, the Delaware, ou

the Atlantic coast, the Tuscarawas, the Little Miami, and the "White, in the

Valley of the Ohio, and the Upper Mississippi. Similar terraces are universal

along the streams flowing out of the glaciated region, and are composed mainly of

material which was first transported from the distant north by Glacial ice. They

are doubtless the deposits occurring during the floods which characterised the

closing portion of the Glacial period. Associated with these implements are the

bones of the mammoth and some other animals, now either wholly extinct, or

extinct in that region. In New Jersey the bones of several Arctic species have

been found.

The approximate date of these closing scenes of the Glacial period seems pretty

clearly to be indicated by the recession of the Falls of Niagara and of St. Anthonj',

where the conditions are uniform, and the length of the gorges, as well as the rate

of recession, known. In both cases the length is a little over seven miles, and the

rate has been ascertaired to be between 3 feet and 5 feet per year. The streams

cannot have been at their work of erosion in those channels much more than

A10,000 years.  similar result is obtained independently from calculations

respecting the enlargement of post-Glacial valleys, the erosion of the banks of

Lake Michigan, and the post-Glacial silting-up of many small lakes. But how-
much earlier than this man's advent on the continent may have occurred it is not

so easy to determine.

The extent of post-Glacial subsidence is much disputed, and has important

bearings on the question of the continuity of Glacial man with the races now
occupying the continent. The post-Glacial subsidence, of which there seems to be

eufficient evidence, amounts only to about 500 feet in the lower axis of the
TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                                                                               649

l^lississlppi Valley, to 230 feet on the coast of Maine, and to 500 feet at Montreal

and in the valley of the Ottawa Eiver.
    The question of a succession of Glacial epochs has narrowed itself down in

America to the question whether or not there have heen two epochs, or one epoch,

with minor halts in the recession of the ice. So far as my own observation goes,

and it has been extensive, the complete separation between the epochs does not
seem to be proved. The forest beds are all pretty well towards the southern part
of the area, and are many of them probably pre- Glacial, while others are of such a

nature that they might have accumulated in a comparatively brief episode of oscilla-
tion of the ice front. The terminal moraine of what is called the Second Glacial
epoch, which stretches with a good degree of continuity from the Atlantic to the

Mississippi, may well enough be regarded as a moraine of retrocession, of which there

are numerous other instances, on a smaller scale, both north and south of this.

5. Oil the Evidences of Glacial Action in Pemhrolceshire, and the Direction oj
           Ice-flow. Bjj Henry Hicks, M.D., F.B.S., Sec. Geol. Soc.

The occurrence of ice-scratched rocks and of northern erratics in north-west

Pembrokeshire has already been mentioned by the author, but in this paper he

brings forward much additional evidence to show that, during the glacial period, a

great thickness of land-ice must have passed over Pembrokeshire.

The glacial stripe which are so well preserved under the drift along the north-

west coast, especially at Whitesand Bay, show that the ice travelled over that area

mainly from a north-western direction. The presence of erratics from North.

Wales and from Ireland would tend to the conclusion that glaciers from these
areas coalesced in St. George's Channel, and that the ice which overspread Pem-

brokeshire was derived from both of these sources, as well, probably, as from a flow

extending down the channel from more northern areas. Although there are in the

district many northern erratics, notably a large boulder of granite and another of

picrite, which the author found on Porthlisky farm, two miles south-west of St.

David's, yet by far the majority are of local origin and can be traced back to the parent

rocks. The gi-eat igneous masses which now form such conspicuous hills along the

north coast yielded most of the boulders, many of very large size, which are so

freely spread over the undulating land reaching to the coast of St. Bride's Bay.

There are clear evidences to show that this bay was itself overspread by a great

thickness of drift from these hills. The intervening pre-glacial valleys were also

filled by this drift, and the plains and rising grounds up to heights of between
300 and 400 feet still retain evidences of its former presence, and many perched

blocks. Excellent sections of unstratified drift, containing large ice-scratched

boulders, are exposed in Whitesand Bay, and a thickness of several feet of an

irregidarly stratified sand was, some time since, exposed under the boulder clay on

the east side of the bay. Chalk flints have been found at heights of over 300 feet,

probably having been "brought from Ireland. The picrite boulder already referred

to has been shown by Professor Bonney to resemble masses of that rock exposed in

Carnarvonshire and Anglesea, and the granite boidder, which before it was broken

must have been over 7 feet in length and 3 to 4 feet in thickness, is identical with

a porphyritic granite exposed in Anglesea, but not found anywhere in Pembroke-

Bhire. The evidences, therefore, which go to prove that Pembrokeshire was buried

under an ice-sheet that must have spread southwards into the Bristol Channel,

are, the presence of many northern erratics, both as perched blocks and in drifts at

heights above 300 feet, ice-scratched, smoothed and polished rock surfaces, and, in

places, much crushing and bending of some of  the strata                                                 also great dispersions of
                                                                                                      ;

boulders from igneous rocks on the north coast in a south-west direction, and some

well-marked examples of ' crag and tail.'

              6. Note on Boulders at Darley, near Matloclc, Derhysliire.

         By Heebekt Bolton, Assistant Keeper, Manchester Museum.

     During the excavation for a small lake close to the Midland Kailway StaticH
at Darley, near Matlock, a cluster of fifteen boulders was exposed, the size of
several being sufficient to justify an examination. The size of the largest boulder
was 10 feet x 6 feet x G feet.

     The boulders lay in a bed of boulder clay which had a thickness of nine

feet.

     The upper part of the clay was of a strong yellow colour and very stiff. Below,
the colour varied from yellow to brown and red, and pockets of sand were com-
mon.

     Only two boulders were well rounded, the rest being sub-angular ou their upper
half, and fairly angular on the lower.

      All the boulders consist of gritstone identical in character with the Chatsworth
grit of the adjoining hills.

     No striations occur on the boulders, but this may be due to the original surface

having crumbled away.

    A series of parallel and shallow grooves occurs on the side of the largest boulders,

and a deep hollow has been scooped out of its southern face.
     The major axis of the undisturbed boulders was approximately north and

south, the general direction for the cluster being 8° west of north.
      The blocks were arranged in the order of their weight in a north to south

direction.

      The clay was fouud to rest upon a deposit of the nature of river gravel.
      The writer is of opinion that the clay is redistributed boulder clay brought
down from the adjoining heights, and that the boulders were brought down at the
 same time from the line of outcrop of the grit.

     He is led to this conclusion by the local character of the boulders, the almost

 total absence of foreigners, and the character of the clay.
      The red and brown colour of the latter at its base seems to show that oxidation

 of the contained iron has proceeded for a longer time than in the case of the upper-
 most clay.

      This would be expected if the clay was redistributed, for the basement mass of
 clay must have been the superficial clay of the heights.

      The enclosed sand would also indicate the complete disintegration of boulders
 of gritstone, &c., whilst the clay was in its primary position.

      The amount of disintegration which has taken place since redistribution is
 marked by the crumbling surface of the large boulders.

      The general direction of the boulders may be explained bj' noting that the

 river flows from north to south.

                                  Bij Percy F. Kendall, F.G.S.

      In the construction of a new railway between Chorlton-cum-Hardy and
  Fairfield a good opportunity was afforded of studying the effects of land-ice.
  The part of the cuttings particularly observed was that extending from Fallow-
 field almost to the L. and N.-W. Railway at Levenshulme, in a line almost

  accurately from west to east.
       Throughout the whole distance the solid geology was displayed with a

  covering of boulder clay. The rocks consisted in descending sequence (and from
  west to east) of triassic pebble beds (fault), Permian marl, Permian sandstone,
  and upper coal measures containing several beds of Ardwick limestone (see
  * Brockbank and De Ptance, Mem. Manch. Lit. and Phil. Soc.,' 4th Series,
  Vol. iv.). The triassic rocks when soft were much mangled and crushed at their
  contact with the drift ; but in places, nearly horizontal intrusions of boulder clay
  were interposed between the bedding. These intrusions always entered from the

   west.

At one point tlie tiiassic beds rose to within about 2 feet of the top of the

cutting, the ground being nearly level.

At the fault blocks of triassic rocks were dragged over on to the Permian

marls. The marls were greatly mangled, and some erratics of large size

(andesites, &c.) were involved in their mass. At the base of the marls a coarse

bed of hard breccia occurred and its surface was striated from N. 65° W. It was

observed that this sui'facc was about 16 feet lower than the triassic sandstone, and

therefore the strire could not have been produced by floating ice, for ice which

could clear the ridge to the westward could not ground at a lower level.

The bands of Ardwick limestone had been much ice-worn, and from each

outcrop a long train of boulders stretched away to eastward.

   A large boulder of coal measure sandstone (not local) lay embedded in the

base of the boulder-clay, and having lodged against its eastern end a large mass

of Ardwick limestone derived from an outcrop to the westward. The upper

surface of the sandstone boulder was scratched from N. 50° W. This stone had

probably been dragged by land-ice across the limestone, and had torn off a mass

which in a transit of 50 yards brought it to a stand, tearing it out of the ice which

moved on and glaciated the upper sm-faee of the boulder. Fragments of each

formation were carried to eastward of the parent mass, but never to westwards.

Several large erratics were observed and, Mith one exception, all had their long

--axes in approximately the same direction, viz. a few degrees north of west.

The exceptional direction was about N. 20° W.

      tiquity of Man. By Professor G. Ekedeeick Wright, LL.D.,

        F.G.S.A., Oberlin, Ohio, U.S.A.

   A brief account was given of the extent of the basaltic beds on the Pacific

Coast, and evidence was presented in proof that they were in the main of post-

tertiary age.

    New evidence, collected by Professor Wright and by Mr. Geo. F. Becker,

was presented confirmatory of the genuineness of the Calaveras skull and other
human remains reported upon by Professor Whitney as from under the lava fiow
of Table Mountain, near Sonora, California. Evidence was also presented of the
discovery of a small clay image under the western edge of the lava plains of
Idaho, at Nampa. These lava outbursts are correlated with the Glacial period in
the eastern part of the continent,

            10. Freliminary Notes on the Excavations at Oldhury Sill.

                       By Joseph Prestwich, D.G.L., F.B.S.

    No rock-shelters like those in Central France have yet been discovered in this

country. In France they occur in a cretaceous district, where the strata weather
luiequally, so that projecting ledges of rock are left over recesses worn out by

natural agencies, and adapted by palreolithic man for his rude dwelling-places.

Large numbers of flint and other implements, mixed with the debris of animals on
which he fed, afford proofs of his habitation. Sites presenting somewhat similar
adaptabilities occur on Oldhury Hill, near Ightham, in Kent. This hill rises
above the level of the surrounding Lower Greensand to the height of 600 feet,
and is capped by some of the hard siliceous grits of the Folkestone beds, which
--6o2 REPORT 1891.

form a flat top to it, 1^7 acres in extent. Its isolation and commanding position
caused it to be chosen for the site of an encampment, lirst by the Britons and
subsequently by the Romans. For the same reasons, it had attracted at an earlier
date palaeolithic man to the district, and he left a considerable number of liis flint
implements scattered around and on the slopes of the hill. This led Mr. Harrison
and myself to suppose that the capping of rock, which was underlaid by loose
friable sands, and overhung in places, might Iiave afforded facilities for rock
skelters ; and for the purpose of inquiry Mr. Harrison undertook to direct the
necessary search, aided by a grant from the British Association. The summit
of the hill and much of the slopes are, however, so thickly wooded that it
was with difficulty that a proper site could be fixed upon. The one that seemed
to us and others most likely was on the north-east side of the hill, where a large
mass of rock formed a low clift' with a small cavity beneath it. Excavations were
accordingly commenced here, but the fallen blocks and the large roots of the
adjacent trees so interfered with the work that, after digging to the depth of 2 to
3 feet without making any discovery, the spot had to be abandoned. It next
occurred to Mr. Harrison that the talus, which extended for some distance on the
slope in front of this ledge of rocks, might have carried with it some of the inhabited
ground, or might have covered some of the original sites. He therefore proceeded
to dig lower down the hill where the ground was undisturbed and free from large

trees.

     Here he was successful in finding, at a depth of about 3 feet, a considerable
number of flint implements and a large quantity of chips and flakes, which look as
though the implements had been made on the spot.

      There is little to distinguish these implements from the ordinary valley-

implements that are so common in the Ightham district, except that, on the whole,
they are more carefully finished and of fewer forms. The prevailing forms at
Oldbury are the small pointed lance-shaped implements worked on both sides, and
the thin, neatly-worked, long, triangular, spear-shaped, of which there are some
highly finished specimens. These are forms which occur at Le Moustier, as do
likewise some of the ruder Oldbury forms. As also at Le Moustier, there is an
absence so far of bone implements, so common in the other Dordogne shelters.
Again, at Oldbury the more ordinary valley-types are wanting ; and so also are
rolled and worn specimens so frequent in other localities. The explorations,
 however, have been at present on too limited a scale to allow of any general
 conclusions being drawn. But as there are still other spots at Oldbury which are
likely to have been used for rock-shelters, it is to be hoped that the work may be
 continued, and further information obtained, ilr. Harrison's Report, which givep
 the result of the work up to the present time, is both satisfactory and encouraging.

      The following Papers and Report were read :

 1. On the Occurrence of Fachytheca and a Species of Nematophijcus in the
       Silurian Beds at Tymawr Quarry, Bumney. By J. Stoerie.

      For a long number of years I have been interested in the fossils known by these
 names, and for that purpose have collected and sectioned wherever practical all
 specimens likely to show structure, and the collection now submitted are the results.

       In the Silurian beds exposed near Cardiflf, which are over 900 feet in thickness,
 I have found Fachytheca in nearly every individual bed, from the very top of the
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  653

Ludlow to the bottom of the Wenlock series, and although Ni'matophycns has not

occurred in so many beds or has escaped my notice, it has exactly the same range,

as I have found it in the tiip of the Ludlow and at the base of the A\'enlock and in
a considerable number of intermediate beds ; still it is only in two beds in Tymawr
Q.uarry that I have found the two species in question preserved in a state which
allowed of transparent sections being made. The lowest bed is a muddy sandstone,
full of Rhynchonella Stricldandi, and the other being a thin parting on the top of
the Ctenodonta sandstone of SoUas, and about 10 feet above the Rumney grit.
The specimens from the last bed being much superior to the lower one, I will only
deal with it.

     This bed is only from 1 to 2 inches in thickness, and contains large numbers
of Discina ruijata, of LiiKjula two species and a large Orhicula with casts of

branching Zoophytes of a species not known to me ; it is wholly of a marine

character, and at a point west-south-west becomes of a concretionary character,
every little nodule of which when broken open shows a fragment, or a whole,
Lingula, Discina, Conularia, or other shell ; the whole bed is highly impregnated
with iron, which rapidly oxidises when broken and exposed to the atmosphere,

and the difficulty is to understand how perhaps the most mineralised bed of the

section should contain the best preserved specimens of these organisms.

    When preserved in mudstone the Pachytheca and Nematophycus do not display

any minute structure, the form and general appearance being the only points to

be recognised.

    When preserved in limestone the carbonaceous character is most readily

noticed, but the microscopic details are not very perfect ; its resemblance to fragments

of drift-wood is very striking to the naked eye or when a hand lens is used.

    When preserved in concretioimry nodules the outer wall is usually perfect, but

the cellular structure of the interior is reduced to a pocket of carbonate of lime or

oxide of iron.

     There are undoubtedly two totally distinct organisms known at present as

Pdchytlieca spJia-rica ; one of which is a perfectly spherical body, variable in size
like the Pachytheca and like it consisting of a more compact outer layer and a less
dense centre, but, however thin this is cut, it never contains any internal structui'e,
showing only a chitinous-like appearance, with sometimes a fungous-like growth
on the exterior; this, I think, is no doubt the eg^ of a crustacean, more especially
as Pteroyotus has been found in this quarry and in a section of the same beds.

Yesterda^Y, a member picked up a specimen which may likely turn out to be a

fragment of Slimonia.

     Pachytheca may be described as a thick -walled globular rind of tubular
tissue, with small intertubular spaces enclosing a small cavit}' of much looser
and more branched tissue, coral-like in appearance, which is in continuous struc-

tural connection with the radiating thick-walled, slightly branched and rather

densely packed tubes of the exterior, the intertubular spaces in the exterior portion,
as seen in transverse section, being small in comparison with the intertubular
spaces found in Nematophycus. I have examined large numbers of Pachytheca to
see whether any hilum or point of attachment was present, and have never seen
any indication either on the external wall or in the internal structure of any such
as might be reasonably expected to show some differentiation, were there any

ground for belie^ing that it was either a fruit of a conifer, or the conceptacle or

even one of the floats of a seaweed like sargassum or ficcus.
     Nematophycus occurs principally in small fragments, waterworn and irregular

in shape and never over an inch in length, and in only one specimen have I found
any appearance of branching ; in this case it was a small stem from the Discina
bed about 5-inch in diameter, rather oval in section and with one branch of barely
·J-inch diameter and a |-inch long, which was again forked at the extremity, the
branchlets being about j'^-inch in length and nearly the same in thickness. The
tissue of the outer part of the stem was slightly differentiated from the interior,

but essentially the structure was the same, and the apparent difference may have

been more dependent on the different degree of oxidisation of the iron in the

weathering of the fossil tlian anv bark-like difference of structure.
--654 EEPORT 1891

      This good piece had no external sj-mmetrical markings visible to the naked
eye, hut there are two small depressions similar to the scar of a dicotj'ledon at
the articulation of a branch and slight indications of a coleorrhiza, as shown
in the section exhibited, and this shows the tissue departing from its normally
perpendicular position, and becoming more horizontal as it nears the depression,
and bending round and running straight towards the scar ; this would indicate
that a branch had died off and that the stem increased in size after the death of
 the branch.

     One peculiar thing about the woody tubes is that they are frequently pene-
trated by the mj'celium of a fungoid growth, and in some cases the resting spore
of from twenty to thirty cells is fully formed and appears exactly like a minute
blackberry in the interior of the woody tubes.

     The structure of Nematophycus may be descriljed as a mass of endless tubes as
far as can be seen in our local specimens, and each individual tube when examined
with the j\ power seems to be composed of a very delicate wickerwork of inter-
laced fibrillse with polygonal interspaces and bearing no resemblance to the
structure of any coniferous wood, sections of several hundreds of which I have

cut and examined from the local beds, at Pwllypant, Caerphilly, &c.
     The structure of the stem of Nematojjhycus is generically, if not specifically,

identical with that described by Mr. Oarruthers from the Canadian Devonian
series as Neinatophijcus Logani, except that the main tubes are only of about half
the size, and the secondary series of tubes, so well seen in tlie American specimens,
is very much less prominent in our local specimens, and the coniferous glandular
markings of Dawson are seen to be the resting spores of the fungus before mentioned.

     The Nematophycus found at Rumney differs also from the Canadian specimens,
in that they show no trace of the concentric rings or the true or apparent
medullary rays referred to by Dawson.

     One curious circumstance is that both Nematdp/iycus and Pachytheca are pre-
served without any appearance of flattening in beds in which the pressure has
crushed flat and distorted greatly such firm and solid shells as Digcina ruyata,
Rhynchonella Strichlandi, and Conularia, which would show that if they were of
an algas-like nature they nuist have had a power during their life of secreting
mineral matter like certain algae in Devonport Harbour.

               3. The Mastodon and Mammoth in Ontario, Canada.
                      By Prof. J. HoYES Panton, M.A., F.G.S.

     The writer in this paper gives a complete description of the remains of a
mastodon discovered (1890) in a marl-bed near Ilighgate, in the Province of
Ontario, Canada, and also the remains of a mammoth found under similar conditions
near Shelburne in the same Province (1889).

     Both specimens were discovered by John Jelly, Esq., of Shelburne. The
following measurements are given for comparison :
                         TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                                                                             655

The bones obtained of the mammoth are not so numerous, the chief being thirty-

one ribs, one 50 inches  in  length and  11  in circumference                                                                   several vertebrje, some

14i inches across ; a massive tusk 12§ feet with a portion broken oft'; and a tooth
weighing 16^ lbs. The writer also refers to remains of Proboscoidea found at other

points in Ontario, viz., St. Catharine's, Duunville, Goat Island, Niagara Falls, and

Kimbal, near the western side of the province.

4. Nute on the occurrence of Anamonites jurensis in the Ironstone of the

     Northampton Sands, in the neighbourhood of Northampton. By E. T.
     Newton, F.G.S., F.Z.S.

     This paper records the discovery, by Mr. Thomas Jesson, of Ammonites jurensis

Ain the ironstone of the Northampton Sands at Brixworth, near Northampton.

considerable number of fossils were collected, most of which were referable to

A771. jurensis and Am. ojialiyius; but with these were also found ^)?2. insignis, Am.

Murchisona;, Nautilus, Belenvnites, Trigonia compta, Triyonia V. Scripita, and
Tancredia.

            5. On certain Ammonite- zones of Dorset and Somerset.
           By S. S. BucKMAN, F.G.S., Hon. Memb. Yorks. Phil. Soc.

     The lower part of the Murchisonce-zone is often intimately connected with th&
upper part of the Opctlinmn-zone ,hut, a little higher, there is a horizon characterised
by numerous specimens of Lud^oigia Murchisona. The fauna of this horizon corre-
 sponds to the Murchtson(s-zoi\e of Oppel, and to the Brauner Jura (3 of Queustedt.
Above the Murchisones-zone a considerable break in the sequence of strata is
frequently met with. In the neighbourhood of Bradford Abbas, however, is
found, superior to the Murchisona-zone, a horizon marked by a very peculiar
 fauna, in which Lioceras concavum and species of the genus Sonninia predominate.
 Taken in a general sense the fauna of this zone (Concavum-zon^) does not agree
 "with that of Quenstedt's Brauner Jura /3 or y, or with that of the Sowerbyi-zone,
 as illustrated by Waagen, Douville, &c. Further, the Sonninia> of the Concavum-
 zone are, biologically, of an earlier type than those of the Sotcerbyt-zone.

      Continental authors find a marked stratigraphical and palaeontological break
 between the Murchisona- and So2oerbyi-zones ; and they wish to draw, at this point,
 a dividing line between Lias and Oolite, or between Toarcian and Bajociau. It is
 suggested that the absence of the Concavum-zone is the cause of this break ; and, in
 former papers to the Geological Society, the author, in supporting the Continental
 plan, regarded the Concavwn-zone as Toarcian.

      In the Bradford Abbas district there is a break above the Concarum-zovie. So
 far as is known at present, Dundry is the only locality showing a complete sequence ;

-- --but some years ago a quarry Coombe, near Sherborne was open, and it yielded

 a large series of Ammonites indicating a fauna agreeing with the Sowe7-byi-zone, as
 illustrated by Continental authors. This quarry has been closed for years; and
 nothing is known as to how the strata are situated with regard to the Concavum-
 zone below, or with superior horizons. It is richer than Dimdry, and is, practically
 speaking, unique among Inferior-Oolite exposures. It is the only locality in England
 which yields this particular fauna. So far as is known, the true Sotverbyi-zone is
 absent from all quarries in Dorset and Somerset, with the exception of Coombe and
 Dundry ; and, therefore, the majority of exposures in the district fully support the

  Continental geologists in their contention as regards a dividing line.

      Waagen places a zone of Am. Sauzei above the Soirerbyi-zone ; and a horizon
 ·with this species and with a particular fauna is shown in ' the marl with green grains

 at Frogden quarry, near Sherborne.

      Above this is the zone of Am. Humphriesianus, in which Stephanocei'as and

  Sphcnroceras predominate. This is the equivalent of the Coronaten-schichten of
  Quenstedt's Brauner Jura S. The upper part of the Brauner Jiu-a 6 is the Bifur-
  caten-schichten ; and this corresponds with the Cadomensis-heiXs of Frogden a
 656 REPORT--1891.

horizon which, containing a fauna distinct from the Humphriesianus-zoTie, may
therefore be known as the Cadumensis-zone.

     The strata above this horizon have usually been called ' Parkiiisotii-zone.' There
are several objections to this name ; and the strata are capable of more subdivision.

     The bed at Halfway House, which yields the large Parkinsonia;, is superior to
the Cadomeiisis-zone. It may be called the Truellii-zoue. At the top of the lime-
stone of the Broad-Windsor district ;S^e/j/ir«i. s«^sni7, and species of Morphoceras are
found : and this is a still higher horizon (Zif/zafj-zone). Just below the Fullers'
Earth of this same district, in the Fullers' Earth itself of Eype, but in the upper
white limestones (about 25 feet thick) of the Bradford-Abbas district, are found
 Oppelia fusca and other species indicating a still higher horizon. It is suggested
that the white limestone of the Bradford-Abbas district is contemporaneous with
the so-called ' Fullers' Earth clay ' of Eype. This horizon may be called the zone
of Oppelia fusca ; and whether this zone belongs to the Inferior Oolite or to the
Fullers' Earth depends on whether the observer be regarding the limestones of the
Bradford- Abbas district or the clay of Eype cliff.

     Several Continental geologists, however, commence the Bathonian with the
Cadotnen^is-zone. To this idea the presence of Farkimonice and other facts give

·considerable support.

6. Notes 011 the Polyzoa (Bryozoa) of the Zones of the Upper Chalk.

                           By Geoege Robert Vine.

In the jear 1867, in a paper on the Lincolnshire Wolds,^ Professor Judd

remarked that ' the time has uot yet come for separating the great mass of the

chalk-l'ormation in this country into zones characterised by their peculiar

assemblages of organic life. Indeed, such a task has not yet been accomplished in

the case of the best-explored districts of the chalk, except in a very imperfect

manner.' Since these sentences were written the task has been attempted, and to

some extent accomplished, but much still remains to be done by specialists.

The present paper, however, deals with the polj'zoa only, and with those of the

Upper Chalk particularly.

In 1870, Mr. C. Evans'- gave a section of the Surrey Hills from Croydon,

through the North Downs to (,)xted, in which he shows the following succession

for the Upper Chalk :                           Parley beds.

In 1875, Dr. Charles BarroiB, in his ' Geology of the Isle of Wight,' established

four pala3ontological divisions of the Upper Chalk, based on the stratigraphical

divisions of Bristow, Ibbetson, and Whitaker :--

the following :

Prestwich :--

' The typical white chalk,' says Professor Prestwich,' ' extends from England

through the North of France, South Belgium, East Holland, "Westphalia,

Hanover, Denmark, South Sweden, the coast of Pomerania, Poland, Silesia

By way of comparison it will he necessary to select, as a type section of the

Upper Chalk in France, the petrological zones of M. A. d'Orbigny, which,
according to Professor Hebert, may be tabulated as follows :

     The Belemnitella quadrata zone is largely developed at Salisbury because it is
worked for the manufacture of whiting, and I think we may take the collection of

Dr. Blackmore, derived from this particular zone, as fairly representative of the

forms of the horizon. The other zones have yielded a fair proportion of the forms
submitted to me for examination, some of which are quite new to the British
Upper Chalk, or new altogether. From the neighbourhoods of Gravesend and
Chatham I have also a fine series of polyzoa, many examples of whicli are free

abstract of my contemplated work.

     It was while collecting information for a full description of the polyzoa of the

whole of the cretaceous rocks, that my attention was drawn to certain peculiarities

of the fossils under consideration, and which seemed to me to separate the

polyzoa of one bed from that of another ; but though the species from one bed
were not, on the whole, widely divergent in character, the fades of alhed forms

generally was well marked, or at least peculiar. These divergencies, therefore, I

do think merit something more than a mere passing notice.

Of coujse, in giving specific or varietal details of our British cretaceous

polyzoa it will be necessary to work along lines so ably planned and utilised by
M. A. d'Orbigny in his palajontological studies, but any slavish adherence to his

plan of characterising, or even of classifying species, would retard rather than

advance our knowledge of the zonal distribution of the polyzoa. Let any one,

however, who is at all acquainted with the polyzoa of the cretaceous formation,

select and carefully study the species belonging to various genera characterised by
the specific name Meudonensis d'Orb. or Parisiensis d'Orb., and he will soon find when

correlating British forms bearing somewhat similar characters to the species

shall be completely successful in my labours, but I may be able to lay founda-
tions OD which some one, far more competent than mj'self, may build advan-

tageously at least. If, however, I take two or three well-marked types of polyzoa

I shall be able to explain my meaninp; better.

     In 1864 Ignaz Beissel ' described and illustrated a peculiar species of

Enf,aloj)hora, which, on account of the delicate markings on the surface of the

zoarium, he named E. lineata, from the chalk mail of Friedrichburg. The species

was found in three different localities, and is marked ' rare.' When working out
my Cambridge Greensand material ' I found that one species in particular was

rather abundant, and, not having at the time any knowledge of Beissel's description
or species, I named the Ch-eensand form Ent(dophora striatopora, Yine.- In 1874
Dr. Reuss described and illustrated two species from the Quader Sandstone of

Strechlen, which he called Entalophora lineata Beiss., and Filisparsa ornata Reuss,

both of which are marked ' rare.' Two years before Reuss, in 1872, Stoleczka, in

his ' Paloeontologica Indica ' (iv. 2, The Ciliopoda), also described E. lineata from
the ' Arria loor gruppe bei Yermamoor in Ostandien.' In 1887, however. Dr.
Marsson ' introduced a new genus, Clinopora, for the inclusion of Beissel's species,
and also a new species in some respects similar to E. striatopora Vine, but not so

coarsely marked on the surface. These are

,, lineata, Beissel  (id. ,, ,, ,, 3)

    After submitting examples of my own species to Dr. Pergens, of Belgium, he

expressed the opinion that as the Cambridge Greensand form was the same as
Clinopora costulata, by right of priority the Riigen form should be characterised as
Clinopara striatopora Vine. For reasons which could be easily given I should

prefer to retain my own name, as given in the last British Association Report,' aa

Entalophora lineata Beissel, Var. striatopora Vine.
     There is still another very characteristic polyzoon found in the Cambridge

Greensand, and also in the chalk marl material from Charing, though not
previously recorded by me. This is the Eschara tenuis, Hag.,'' or the Epidictyon
tcnue, Marsson.^ The species is rare everywhere. Marsson records it from Upper
Turonian and Middle Senonian, Riigen, but it is present also in the English Chalk
of Salisbury (but rare), in the Eeleinnitella mucronata zone. The same species is
recorded by Reuss from the marl-beds of the Quader Sandstone of Saxony as
Lanceopora striolata Reuss." In the Cambridge Greensand the examples are
very strongly marked on the surface.

     In the Riigen example, and also in the Salisbury example, the surface lines are
distinct but faint, and, like Entalophora lineata and its varieties, the fades of the
various examples indicate, to some extent, the horizon from which they have been

derived.

    The presence of " Cretaceous" polyzoa in the Miocene rocks of Australia may

at first seem to upset the usefulness of any attempt to fix the zonal distribution
of species. I possess a slide containing examples of all the Vincularin species

described by Mr. A. W. Waters in his first paper on the Australian Bryozoa,*
(from Yarra-Varra, Victoria), but I am not able to deal with these forms in this
abstract ; their presence in Australian rocks may be easily accounted for when we
remember that both in Australia and New Zealand, according to Prestwich,"

there is a considerable development of Cretaceous or Cretaceo-Tertiary strata.

importance of a thoroufrh comparison of PaLTOzoic with Cretaceous genera, for

the numher of known Cretaceous genera is very large, and with these and the

great value to the paleontologist, but the comparison must be made with actual
examples of the fauna from the several formations, and not with figures or mere
descriptions of the same. During the last twenty years some thousands of

examples from all formations have passed through my bauds, and possibly some

light could be thrown upon the question indicated by ^Mr. Waters, but ample
space and special illustrations are necessary to do the work well.

--President of the Section Francis Darwin, M.A., M.B., F.R.S.

                       THUBSDAY, AUGUST 20.

The President delivered the following Address :

            On Growth-curvatures in Plant?.

A seedling plant, such as a young sunflower when growing in a state of nature,,

grows straight up towards the open sky, while its main root grows straight down

Whentowards the centre of the earth.  it is artificially displaced, for instance,

by laying the flower-pot on its side, both root and stem execute certain curvaturefi

by which they reach the vertical once more. Curvatures such as these, whether

executed in relation to light, gravitation, or other influences, may be grouped

together as growth-curvatures, and it is with the history of our knowledge

on this subject that I shall be occupied to-day. I shall principally deal with

geotropic curvatures, or those executed in relation to gravitation, but the phe-

nomena in question form a natural group, and it will be necessary to refer to

heliotropism and, indeed, to other growth-curvatures. The history of the subject

divides into two branches, which it will be convenient to study separately.

    When a displaced apogeotropic organ curves so as to become once more

vertical, two distinct questions arise, which may be briefly expressed thus :

    How1. does the plant recognise the vertical line ; how does it know where

the centre of the earth is ?

2. In what way are the curvatures which bring it into the vertical line

executed ?

The first is a question of irritability, the second of the mechanism of movement.

Sachs has well pointed out that these two very difl'erent questions bav© been con-

fused together.^ They should be kept as distinct as the kindred questions how.

by what nervous apparatus, does an animal perceive changes in the external

world ; and how, by what muscular machinery, does it move in relation to such

changes ?

The history of our modern knowledge of geotropism may conveniently begin

with Hofmeister's researches, because in an account of his work some of the points

which re-occur in recent controversy are touched, and also because in studying his

work the necessity of dividing the subject into the two above-named headings.

Irritability and Mechanism will be more clearly perceived.

In 1859 - Hofmeister published his researches on the effect of disturbance, such

as shaking or striking a turgescent shoot. This appears at first sight sufficiently

remote from the study of geotropism, but the facts published in this work were

tJie basis of the theory of geotropism formed by Hofmeister and accepted with

some modification by Sachs. When an upright, vigorously-growing, turgescent

shoot is struck at its base the upper end is made to curve violently towards the

            ' Arheiten, ii. p. 282 (1879).

Whenside from wliicli the blow came.        tlie shoot comes to rest it is found to

be no longer straight, but to have acquired a permanent bend towards the side on

which it was strucli. In explaining this phenomenon Ilofmeister described those

conditions of growtli which give rise to what is known as the tension of tissues

these facts are still an important part of botanical study, though they hold
quite a difterent position from that assigned to them by Hofmeister. The classifi-
cation into active or erectile tissue and passively extended tissue was then first

made. The pith, which is compressed, and strives to become longer, is the active

ov erectile part, the cortical and vaschlar constituents being pa.ssively extended

by the active tissue. Ilofmeister showed that when the shoot is violently bent

the elasticity of the passive tissues on the convex side is injured by overstretching.

The system   must  assume  a  new position  of equilibrium                                                          the  passive  tissues are
                                                                                                                 ;

now no longer equally resisting on the two sides, and the shoot must necessarily

assume a curvature towards that side on which passive tissues are most resisting.

In a second paper, in 18G0, Hofmeister ' applied these principles to the explana-

tion of geotropism. It is true that in his second paper he does not refer to the

former one, but I think that it can hardly be doubted that the knowledge which

supplied the material for his paper of 1859 suggested the theory set forth in 1860,

He had shown that in the system of tensions existing in a turgescent shoot lay the

power of producing artificial curvatures, and he applied the same principle to the

natural curvatures. When an apogeotropic organ is placed in a horizontal position

Hofmeister'- supposed that the resisting tissues on the lower side became less resist-

ing, so that they yielded more readily than those on the upper side to the longitu-
dinal pressure of the turgescent pith. The system in such a case comes to rest in a

new position, the shoot curving upwards ; the passive tissues on the upper and lower
sides once more resist the expansion of the pith in equal degrees. In this way

Hofmeister hit on an explanation which, as far as mechanism is concerned, is in rough

outline practically the same as certain modern theories, which will be discussed in

the sequel.

     His views resembled more modern theories in this, too : he clearly recognised
that they were, mutatis mutandis, applicable to acellular^ organs. The manner in
which Hofmeister compared the mechanics of multicellular and acellular parts was
curious ; nowadays we compare the turgescent pith of a growing shoot with the

hydrostatic pressure inside the acellular organ. Just as the pressure inside a single

cell stretches the cell-walls, so in a growing shoot the turgescent pith stretches the

cortex. As pith is to cortex, so is cell-pressure to cell-membrane. But Hof-

meister would not have accepted any such comparison. In the case of acellular
organs be localised both the erectile and passive tissues in the membrane. The

cuticle was said to be passively extended by the active growth of the inner layers

of the cell-wall.

     It is remarkable that the obvious source of power which the pressure of the
cell-sap against the cell-walls supplies should have been so much neglected. This
may perhaps be accounted for as a revulsion against the excessive prominence given

to osmosis in the works of Dutrochet.
     The great fault of Hofmeister's views was the purely mechanical manner in

which he believed changes in extensibility in the passive tissues to be brought about.

When an apogeotropic shoot is placed horizontal there would be a tendency,

according to Hofmeister, for the resisting passive tissues along the lower side of

the shoot to become waterlogged owing to the tiuid in the shoot gravitating
towards that side. They would thus be rendered more extensible, and the shoot
would bend up, since its lower parts would yield to the erectile tissues in the

centre. Such a conception excludes the idea of gravitation acting as a stimulus,
and tends to keep geotropism out of the category in which it now takes its place

     - Knight had previously suggested an explanation (PliilosopJdcal Transactions,
1 806), which is so far similar, that the sinking downwards by gravitation of the
juices of the plant is supposed to be the primary cause of apogeotropism. Knight's
explanation of positive geotropism is practically the same as Hofmeister's.

along with sucli obvious cases of response to stimulation as the movements of
Mimosa. In this respect it was a retrogression from the views of some earlier

 writers. Diitrochet's clear statement (1824) as to growth-curvatures heing au
affair of stimulus and response wiU be quoted lower down. Treviranus in his
' Physiologie '(1838) speaks of geotropism as a Trieb, or impulse, and adds that
thougli there is no question of desire or sensation as in the impulses of animals, yet
geotropism must be thought of as something higher than a merely mechanical or
chemical action.

      In taking such a view Ilofmeister naturally neglected the biological side of the

study of geotropism. Now we think of gravitation as a stimulus, which the plant

translates according to its needs. The plant, so to speak, knows where the centre
of the_ earth is, and either grows away from it, or towards it, according as either
direction suits its mode of existence.

    We have seen how Hofmeister's view enabled him to apply a common explana-

tion to acellular and multicellular organisms. But it led hini into an error which
more than counterbalances the credit due to such a generalisation, namely, into

--separating what are now universally considered parts of a single phenomenon viz.,

negative and positive geotropism. He gave totally different explanations of the
bending down of a root and the bending up of a stem. It is well known that he
supposed a root to be plastic, and to bend over by its own weight, like a tallow

candle on a hot day or a piece of heated sealing-wax.
    The development of a unified view of heliotropism, geotropism, and other similar

curvatures is a part of my subject, and for that reason the curious want of unity

in Hofmeister's views is interesting.

    In 1865 Sachs published his ' Experimental-Physiologie.' He here accepts

Hofmeister's views with certain modifications.

                                                                                                Irritahility.

When by a touch on a trigger the explosion of a pistol is caused we do not

say that the pistol is irritable, but when in an organism a similar release of

stored-up energy occurs we apply the term irritahility to the phenomenon, and we

call the influence which produced the cbange a stimulus. At this time (1866)

there was, as far as I can discover, no idea that growth-curvatures were pro-

duced by external influences acting as stimuli. Gravitation and light were sup-

posed to act directly, and not as releasing forces. This is all the more remarkable,

--because
Dutrochet                                                                                  had  expressed with  great  clearness  the conception which we

could be more to the purpose than this, and it is one of the most curious points in
·the history of the subject that the botanical mind should have taken more than
fifty years to assimilate Dutrochet 's view.

     In 1868 Albert Bernhard Frank published his valuable 'Beitriige zur Pflanzen-
physiologie,' which was of importance in more than one way. In this work the
term ' geotropism ' was first suggested in imitation of the existing expression ' helio-
tropism.' This uniformity of nomenclature had an advantage beyond mere con-
venience, for it served to emphasise the view that the curvatures were allied in
character. His criticisms of Hofmeister and Sachs were directed against the

--following views : (i.) That roots and other positively geotropic organs bend

owing to plasticity. By repeating and varying certain older experiments, Frank
helped materially to establish the now universally accepted view that positive

     ' Recherches anat. svr la Sfrvctttre intime, §-c. 1824, p. 107. Dutrochet, however,
was not consistent in this matter, and later on gave explanations as mechanical a&
Hofmeister's.

geotropism is an active, not a passive, curvature, and that it depends, like apo-

geotropism, on unequal distribution of longitudinal growth. Here, ao-ain, he
introduced unity, bringing what had been considered different phenomena under

a common heading. By studying the distribution of growth and of tension in a

variety of curvatures he helped still more to unite them under a common point

of view.

    (ii.) He showed that Ilofmeister's classification of organs into those (I) which

have and (2) which have not tension, was valueless in connection with growth-

curvatures                                                    that is to say that apogeotropism is not necessarily connected with
                                                           ;

the form of longitudinal tension found in growing shoots, and that the distinct kind

of tension existing in roots has no connection with their positive geotropism. His
work thus served to bring the subject into a more purely physiological condition,'

not only by his downright opposition to a mechanical tlieory backed by the great
name of Hofmeister, but also by giving importance to physiological individuality.

In 1870 Frank published a more important work, ' Die natiirliche wagerechte

Eichtung der Pflanzentheilen.' This paper not only tended to unite geotropism

and heliotropism by proving the phenomena described to be common to both

categories, but it more especially widened the field of view by showing that
horizontal growth must be considered as kindred to vertical growth, and thus
introduced a new conception of the reaction of plants to light and gravitation

which has been most fruitful.

     Frank showed that certain parts of plants, for instance the runners of the
strawberries, even when kept in the dark, grow horizontally, and when displaced

from the horizontal returned to it. Here, said Frank, is a new type of geotropism,

neither positive nor negative, but trans verse. Ten years later Elfving,' working in

Sachs' laboratory, got similar results with rhizomes of Scirpus, &c. These experi-

ments are more conclusive than Frank's in one way, because the strawberry runners
when darkened were in abnormal conditions, whereas the rhizomes used by Elfvino-

were normally freed from light-effects. When a rhizome which has been placed
so as to point obliquely upwards moves down towards the horizontal position it

is, according to the old nomenclature, positively geotropic, and, vice versa, when it

reaches the horizontal from below it is negatively geotropic. But it cannot be both
Wepositively and negatively geotropic.
                                                              are bound to assume that it is so organised

that it can only assume a position of rest, and continue to grow in a straight line
when it is horizontal, just as an ordinary geotropic organ cannot devote itself to
rectilinear growth unless it is vertical, 'in this way Frank's conception of trans-
verse geotropism paved the way for the theory that there are a variety of different
organisations (or, as we may now say, irritabilities) in growing plants ; and that,
whether a plant grows vertically upwards or downwards or horizontally, depends

on the individual and highly sensitive constitution of the plant in question. It is,

of course, true that those who seek for mechanical explanations of growth curva-

tures might be able to find such a one for transverse geotropism. But when Frank's

conception has once been seized such views are less and less acceptable ; and, judg-

ing from my own experience, I cannot doubt that Frank's work deserved to have

a powerful effect in preparing the minds of physiologists for a just view of

irritability.

    The belief in transverse geotropism received interesting support from Vochting's'
work on the movement of certain flowers which retain a horizontal position imder

the influence of gravitation.

    Frank's views, it may be added, were accepted by my father and myself in our

* Power of Movement,' in which the term diageotropism was proposed, and has

been generally accepted, for transverse geotropism. Nevertheless, though Frank

was undoubtedly right, his views were strongly opposed at the time. He held

similar views on the effect of light, believing that the power possessed by leaves of

placing themselves at right angles to the direction of incident light must be con-
sidered as a new type of heliotropic movement, transverse or diaheliotropism.

Frank's views were criticised and opposed by De Vries,^ who, by means of experi-

' Elfving, Sachs' Arheiien, 1880.                             ^ Die Bemegung der BUithen vnd Frilchte, 1882.

664 REPORT-- 1891.

ments carried out in tlie WiirzLurg laboratory, tried to show that Frank's results
can be explained without having resort to new types of geo- or heliotropism. De
Vries believed, for instance, that a leaf may be apheliotropic and apogeotropic,

and that its horizontal position under vertical illumination is due to a balance

struck between the opposing tendencies, one of which calls forth an upward, the
other a downward curvature.

The same point of view occurs again in Sachs' paper on ' Orthotrope and Pla-

giotrope Plant-members.'' Sachs holds to the opinion that Frank's theory is

untenable, that it is upset by De Vries, and that the oblique or horizontal position

is to be explained as the result of a balance between opposing tendencies.

In a paper published the following year (1880) - 1 attempted to decide between

Mythe opposing views.    experiments proved that at least certain leaves can place

themselves at right angles to the direction of incident light when there is no

possibility of a balance being struck. The outcome of my experiments was to
convince me that Frank's views are correct, namely, that the quality of growth

called transverse heliotropism does exist.

    This view was accepted by my father in the ' Power of Movement.' The

conclusions of Vochting, in the"' Bot. Zeitung,' 1888, and Krabbe in Pringsheim's

' Jahrbiicher,' 1889, vol. xx. are on the same side of the question.

The general result of these confirmations of Frank's conception has been to

bring to the front a belief in the individuality of the plant in deciding what shall

be the effect of external conditions. Such a view does not necessarily imply

irritability in a strict sense, for Frank himself explained the facts, as we shall see,
in a different way. But it could not fail to open our eyes to the fact that in

growth-curvatures as in other relations to environment external changes are

effective as guides or sign-posts, not as direct causes.

Frank saw clearly that plants may gain such various aptitudes for reacting to

light and gravitation as best suit their modes of life.

     In stating this view he refers to the influence of the 'Origin of Species,'

which had shown how any qualities useful to living things might be developed by

natural .selection. Frank described the qualities thus gained under the term

polarity. He supposed that the cell-membranes of a transversely heliotropic leaf

(for instance) were so endowed that a ray of light striking it obliquely from

base to apex produced an increase of growth on the side away from the light

while a ray oblique from apex to base caused a reverse movement. The polarity-

assumption of Frank is a purel}' gratuitous one, and, if strictly interpreted, hardly

tends to bring growth curvatures into harmony with what we know of the relation

of life to environment.

It will no doubt appear to be a forcing of evidence if, after such a statement as

the last, I still claim for Frank that he led the way to our modern view of

irritability. I can of course only judge of the effect of his writings on myself, and

I feel sure that they prepared me to accept the modern views. It must also be

insisted that Frank, in spite of his assumption of polarity, seems to have looked

at the phenomena in a manner not very different to ours of the present day.
Thus he compares the action of gravitation on plants to the influence of the

perception of food on a chicken. He speaks too of custom,' or use, building up the

specialised ' instinct ' for certain curvatures. These are expressions consistent

with our present views, and I think that Vines* is perfectly just in speaking of

Frank's belief in different kinds of irritability, although in so judging he may

perhaps have followed equity rather than law.
     One of the chief bars to the development of our present views on irritability was

the fact that simple growth in length is influenced, and markedly influenced, by

differences in illumination. Plants grow more quickly, ccBteris paribus, in darkness
than in light. With this fact to go on, it was perfectly natural that simple
mechanical explanations of heliotropism should be made. De CandoUe, as ia

well known, explained such curvatures by the more rapid growth of the shaded

side. Thus it came about that heliotropism was discussed, for instance, in Sachs'

' Sachs' Arheiten, 1879.  = Journal Linn. Soc. 1880.

rectilinear growth.

Shortly afterwards, in 1876, a pupil of Sachs, Miiller-Thurgau, published ' a

--research carried out in the WUrzhurii: Laboratory, which is of some importance.

]n the introductory remarks he wrote : ' It has been hitherto supposed that helio-

tropic curvatures depend on a difference in intensity of illumination on the two

sides.  Sachs  came to a  different  opinion  in  his work  on  geotropism                                                      he found
                                                                                                                             :

himself compelled to believe that in heliotropic just as in geotropic curvatures it is

not a question of different intensities on opposite sides, but rather that heliotropic

effect depends on the direction of the light.' -
     Miiller's research gave weight to this union of geo- and heliotropic effects by

showing a number of resemblances in the manner and form of the two curvatures.
Again, when it was found ^ that apheliotropie organs are influenced by light and
darkness in precisely the same manner as positively heliotropic ones, it became

clear that the mechanical explanation of De Candolle was untenable for negatively

heliotropic organs. It might still no doubt be upheld for positively heliotropic

organs, but as a matter of fact it was not so upheld. There was a tendency

to unify our view of growth-curvatures, and the union of the two forms of
heliotropism gave strength to the movement. Nor was this all ; when it became

clear that light did not produce heliotropic curvatures by direct mechanicaleffect
it was natural to remember that gravitation has none either ; we cannot point to

any reason (except the crudest ones) why the lower side of a horizontal stem, or

the upper side of a horizontal root, should grow the faster for the direct effects of

gravitation. That being so, light and gravitation could be classed together as

external agencies acting, not directly, but in some unknown indirect manner. I do

not imply that such a result followed immediately, but that the line of research

above alluded to helped in some degree to lead the way to a belief in growth-

curvatures as phenomena of irritability.

    When my father was writing our book, ' The Power of Movement in Plants

(1880), in which he adopted to the fullest extent a belief that growth curvatures
are phenomena of irritability, the only modern statement of such a view which he

could find was in a passage by Sachs,* where he writes that ' The living material of

plants is internally difl'erentiated in such a way that diflerent parts are supplied

with specific energies resembling those of the sensory-nerves (Sinnesnerven) of

animals. Anisotropy in plants fulfils the same purpose as do sense-perceptions in

animals.'

The idea of irritability as applied to growth curvatures is expressed with suffi-

cient clearness in the ' Power of ^Movement.' Thus for the case of geotropism we

wrote (p. 521) : ' Different parts or organs on the same plant, and the same part in
different species, are thus excited to act in a widely different manner. AVe can see

no reason why the attraction of gravity should directly modify the state of

targescence and subsequent growth of one part on the upper side and of another

Wepart on the lower side.  are therefore led to infer that both geotropic, apogeo-

tropic, and diageotropic movements, the purpose of which we can generally

understand, have been acquired for tlie advantage of the plant by the modification

of the ever present movement of circumnutation. This, however, implies that

gravitation produces some effect on the young tissues sufficient to serve as a

Aguide to the plant.'     similar view is given for heliotropism. It should be noted

that the essence of the view, namely, that light and gravitation act as guides or

landmarks by which the plant can "direct itself, can be held without a belief ia

circumnutation.

and reaction is fully given, and is applied, among other cases, to that of heliotropism
and geotropism. PJeff'er states clearly, and -without reserve or obscurity, the view
that light and gravitation act as stimuli or releasing forces, in manners decided by
the organisation of the plant. Pfeffer seems to me to be the first writer who has
treated the subject fully and consistently.

     In Sachs' ' Vorlesungen,' 1882, a view similar to that briefly sketched in his
paper of 1879 is upheld. Geotropism and heliotropism are described as Reiz-
erscheinungen, i.e. phenomena of stimulation. The phenomena in question are
described under the heading Anisotropy, a word which expresses, according to
Sachs,' ' the fact that different organs of a plant under the influence of the same
external forces assume the most varied directions of growth.' In another passage '"
he states that the anisotropy of the diflerent organs ' is nothing else than the ex-
pression of their diflerent irritability to the influence of gravity [and] light, &c.'

     Vines,^ who has recently (1886) summarised the evidence on growth curvatures,
and whose researches on kindred subjects entitle his opinion to respect, accepts

fully the view that gravitation, light, &e., act as stimuli.
      It is not necessary to trace the subject further, the views under discussion being-

now well recognised canons of vegetable physiology.

      I cannot, however, omit to mention Pl'efl'er's'' brilliant researches on the
cbemotaxis (irritability to certain reagents) of low organisms, such as antherozoids
and bacteria. To take a single instance, I'l'efl'er showed that the antherozoids in
responding to the effect of malic acid follow precisely the same law that in animals
correlates the strength of stimulus and amount of effect. This result, altliough it has
no direct connection with growth-curvatures, is nevertheless of tlie highest import-
ance in connection with the general question of vegetable irritability.

     Nor can I omit to mention the ingenious reasoning by which NolP localised
the seat of irritability in a vegetable cell. He points out how in acellular plants,
such as Caulerpa or Derbesia, the flowing protoplasm may travel from positively

geotropic root to apogeotropic stem, and he argues from this that the motile
endoplasm cannot be the seat of specific irritability. The flowing plasma
which is always changing its position with regard to external forces must be as
fully incapacitated from responding to them as though the plant were turning on
a klinostat. It follows from this that it must be the stationary ectoplasm which

--perceives external change. From a different point of view this is what we should

expect we should naturally suppose that the part which regulates the growth of
the membrane, and therefore the curvature of the cell, should be the irritable

constituent of the cell contents.
      In attempting to trace the history of the establishment of growth-curvatures as

phenomena of irritability, I have been forced to confine myself to a slight sketch.
I have found it impossible to give a full account of the course of research on the
subject. I have given an account of some of the halting-places in the journey of
thought, but not of the manner in which belief has travelled from stage to stage.
Far greater knowledge than mine would he required to compile such an itinerary.

                                                       Meclianism.

   mThe first step advance of Hofmeister's views was the establishment that the

curvatures under consideration are due to unequal growth, that is to say, to an
excess of longitudinal growth on the convex than the concave side. It is not,

however, easy to say how far Hofmeister had this idea, for it, in fact, depends on
how we define 'growth.' Hofmeister knew, of course, that the convex side of q
curved shoot was longer than it had been before the curvature occurred ; this is a
mathematical necessity. But he also made out the important point that the con-
cave side increases in length during the curvature. These permanent elongations he
must have known to be growth, but his attention was directed to what is, after all,
the more important point, namely, why it was that unequal elongation took place.

     Sachs, in his ' Experimental-Physiologic,' held that growth curvatures are due

to unequal growth. In bis Text-Book (1874), Englisli translation, 1882, p. 8o3,
the author, referring to Hofmeister's work, says: ' I pointed out that the growth
of the under surface of an organ capable of curving upwards was accelerated, and
that of the upper surface retarded ; I did not at the time express an opinion as to

whether these modifications of growth were due to an altered distribution of plastic

material or to a change in the extensibility of the passive layers of tissue.' Frank's

already quoted paper made valuable contributions to the subject. He showed

--that the epidermic cells on the convex side of the root are longer than those on
the concave side,  that     is,  they  have  grown  more                             he  explained apogeotropic
                                                                                  ;

cxirvatures in precisely the same way. He showed, moreover, that the sharp

curve close to the tip of a geotropic root, and the long gradual curve of an

apogeotropic shoot, are necessary consequences from the manner in which growth

is distributed in these parts. He demonstrated that rectilinear growth and

geotropic curvature require the same external conditions; that, for instance, a

temperature low enough to check growth also puts a stop to geotropism.
     The distribution of longitudinal growth which produces geotropism was after-

wards studied by Sachs,' who thoroughly established the fact that the convex
side grows faster, while the concave side grows slower, than if the organ had

remained vertical and uncurved.
     These facts are of interest in themselves, but they do not, any more than

Frank's results, touch the root of the matter. Until we know something of the
mechanics of rectilinear growth, we cannot expect to understand curves produced
by growth. The next advance in our knowledge did in fact accompany advancing

knowledge of rectilinear growth. It began to be established, through Sachs'
Awork, that turgescence is a necessary condition of growth.
                                                                                         turgescent cell is

one which is, as it were, over-filled with cell sap ; its cell-walls are stretched by

the hydrostatic pressure existing within. In osmosis, which gives the force by

which the cells are stretched, a force was at hand by which growth could be con-

ceived to be caused. The first clear definition of turgor, and a statement of ita

importance for growth, occurs in Sachs' classical paper on growth.-

As soon as the importance of turgor in relation to growth was clearly put

forward, it was natural that its equal importance with regard to growth curvatures

should come to the fore, and that increased growth on the convex side (leading to

curvature) should be put down to increased internal cell-pressure in those tissues.
In the fourth edition of Sachs' 'Lehrbuch,' 1874, Eng. tr. 1882, p. 834, such a view
is tentatively given, but the author saw very clearly that much more evidence was
needed before anything like a conclusion as to the mechanism of movement could

--be arrived at. The difficulty which faced him was not a new one in a slightly
--different form it had occurred to Hofmeister the question, namely, whether the

curvatures of acellular and multicellular organs depend on the same or on different

causes. If one explanation is applicable to both, then we must give up as a

primary cause any changes in the osmotic force of the cells. For no change in the

pressure inside a cell will produce a curvature in that cell, whereas, in a multi-

cellular organ, if in the cells in one longitudinal half an increase of osmotic sub-

stances takes place, so that the cell walls are subject to greater stretching force,

curvature will take place.

    On the other hand, if the cause of bending of acellular and multicellular organs
is the same, we must believe that the curvature takes its origin in changes in the
cell-walls. In an acellular organ, if the cell membranes yield symmetrically to

internal pressure, growth will be in a straight line ; if it yields asymmetrically it
will curve. Thus, if the membrane along one side of a cell becomes more or less

resisting than the rest of the membrane, a curvature will result.

If we are to apply strictly the same principle to acellular and multicellular

organs, we must suppose that the whole organ curves, because each individual cell
behaves like one of the above described free cells, the curvature of the whole
resulting from the sum of the curves of the separate cells. This was Frank's view,

and it also occurs in Sachs' Text-Book, 1874, Eng. trans., 1882, p. 842.

    Are we bound to believe that the mechanism of acellular and multicellular

curvatures is so strictly identical as Frank supposed ? In the first place, it is not

clear why there should be identity of mechanism in the movements of organs or
plants of completely diflerent types of structure. The upholders of the identity
chiefly confine themselves to asseveration that a common explanation must apply
to both cases. I believe that light may be thivwn on the matter by considering

turgescence, not in relation to growth, but in regard to stability of structure.

    An acellular organ, such as the stalk of the sporangium of !Mucor, owes its

strength and stiffness to the tension between the cell contents and the elastic cell-

wall, but it does not follow from this that in multicellular organs strength and stiff-
ness are due to the sum of the strengths of its individual ceils. Indeed, we know
that it is not so ; the strength of a multicellular organ depends on the tension between
pith and cortex. It is, in fact, a model of the single cell; the pith represents the

cell-sap, the cortex the cell-wall. Here, then, it is clear that the function performed
by the cell-wall in one case is carried out by cortical tissues in the other. If this

is the case for one function there is no reason why it should not/ hold good ia

another, viz., the machinery of movement.

     If we hold this view that the cortex in one case is analogous with a simple
membrane in the other, we shall not translate the unity of acellular and multicellular
organs so strictly as did Frank. Indeed, we may fairly consider it harmonious with
our knowledge in other departments to find similar functions performed by morpho-
logically different parts. The cortex of a geotropic shoot would thus be analogous
with the membrane of a geotropic cell in regard to movement, just as we know that

these parts are analogous in regard to stability.

      In spite of the difficulties sketched above, one writer of the first rank, namely,
H. de Vries, has upheld the view that growth curvatures in multicellular organs '
are due to increased cell-pressure on the convex side ; the rise in hydrostatic pres-

sure being put down to increase of osmotic substances in the cell-sap of the tissues
in question. Such a theory flowed naturally from De Vries' interesting plasmolytic
work.'- He had shown that tliose sections of a turgescent shoot which were in
most rapid growth show the greatest amount of shortening when turgescence is
removed by plasmolysis. This was supposed to show that growth is proportional
to the stretching or elongation of the cell-walls hj turgor. Growth, according to
this view, consists of two processes: (1) of a temporary elongation due to turges-
cence, and (2) of a fixing process by which the elongation is rendered permanent.
 De Vries assumed that where the elongation occurred, its amount must be propor-

 tional to the osmotic acti^^ty of the cell contents ; thus neglecting the other factor

in the problem, namely, the variability in the resistance of the membranes. He

 applied the plasmolytic method to growth curvatures, and made the same deductions,
 lie found that a curved organ shows a flatter curve' after being plasmolysed. This,
 according to his previous argument, shows that the cell-sap on the convex is more

 powerfully osmotic than that on the concave side. This again leads to increased cell-

 Gtretching, and finally to increased growth.
      The most serious objection to De Vries' views is that the convex half of a

 curving organ does 7jot contain a greater amount of osmotically active substance.*

 It must, however, be noted in the heliotropic and geotropic curvature of pulvini,

--there is an osmotic difference between the two halves '' so that, if the argument

 from uniformity is used against De Vries (in the matter of acellular and multi-
 cellular organs), it may fairly be used in his favour as regards the comparison of
 curvatures produced with and without pulvini.

      It is not easy to determine the extent to which De Vries' views on the mechanics
 of growth curvature were accepted. The point, however, need not detain us,

 for the current of conviction soon began to run in an opposite direction.*

     Sachs * had already pointed out that attention should be directed to changes in
extensibility of cell-walls as an important factor in the problem.

     Wiesner, in his 'Ileliotropische Erscheinung-en,' - held that the curvature of
multicellular organs is due both to an increase of osmotic force on the convex
side, and to increased ductility ' of the membranes of the same part. lie repeated

De Vries' plasmolytic experiments, and made out the curious fact that in many

cases the curvature is increased instead of being diminished. lie attributed the
result to the concave tissues being more perfectly elastic than ductile convex

tissues, so that when turgescence is removed the more elastic tissues shorten most,
and, by diminishing the length of the concave side, increase the curvature.

     Strasburger, in his ' Zellhaute,' 1882, suggested that growth curvatures are
due to increased ductility of the convex membranes, and gave a number of instances
to prove that a change to a ductile condition does occur in other physiological
processes, such as the stretching of the cellulose ring in ffidogonium to a uniform
thin membrane, the branching of Cladophora, and the escape of sexual products in

certain algae.

   We now pass on to the work of two observers, Wortmann and Noll, who have

devoted special attention to mechanism of curvatures. Wortmann^ started on the

assumption, already several times mentioned, that the growth-curvature of acellular

and multicellular organs must have a common cause. lie began by testing Kohl's state-

ment* that when the sporangiferous bypha of a Phycomyces curves apogeotropically

or heliotropically, &c., there is a collection of protoplasm on the concave wall.

"Wortmann principally investigated the curvature discovered in Phycomyces by

Errera,^ which can be produced by contact. When the hypha is touched with a

glass filament or with a platinum wire, or by allowing a speck of Indian ink to dry

on it, it curves over towards the touched side. The hypha is so highly sensitive to

contact that it curves in from three to six minutes ; it is clearly a growth-curva-

ture, for it only occurs in the part of the hypha which is growing. In curvatures

thus produced, as well as in apogeotropic and heliotropic curvatures the accumula-

tion of protoplasm on the concave side is, according to "Wortmann, clearly visible,

and, what is more important, the membrane becomes thicker on the concave side,

sometimes twice as thick as on the opposite side of the cell. In consequence of the

unequal thickening of the membranes, the cell is supposed to yield asymmetrically

cell-pressure, and the necessary consequence is that the cell grows into a curved

form.

    In applying the same method of investigation to multicellular parts, Wortmann

followed Ciesielski,' who noticed that in geotropically curved roots the cells of the

concave (lower) side of the organ are much more densely filled with protoplasm

than are the convex cells. Sachs ^ describes a similar state of things in the halms

of grasses, and Kohl, again, in tendrils and the stems of climbing plants.

Wortmann first of all made sure that no redistribution of protoplasm could b&

observed in the individual cells of curving multicellular organs. If each cell be-

haved independently like a free cell, we might expect to find a collection of proto-

plasm on the concave wall of all the constituent cells of a curving shoot. But this

is not the case. Nor at first could any microscopic diflPerences be made out between

the concave and convex tissues of a curving shoot. But when the stimulus was

Amade to act for a long time, diSerences were apparent.  young Phaseolus plant

was placed so that the epicotyl was horizontal and was forced to grow in the

horizontal direction by a thread attached to the end of the stem, passing over a

pulley and fastened to a weight. Here the gentropic stimulus could continue to act

for 24-30 hours, and under sucli conditions a marked change in the tissues was
visible. The cells of the cortex on the upper side became densely filled with pro-
toplasm, while the lower cortical cells were relatively poor in protoplasmic contents.
The same changes in the membranes occur as those noticed in Phycomyces, that is
to say, the walls of the cortex on the upper side are very much thicker than those

on the lower side.'
     Since the walls of the cortical cells have become more resisting on tbe upper

than on the lower side, then (assuming the osmotic expanding force to be the same
in both cases) the growth will be quicker on the lower side, and the shoot will
curve upwards. Wortmann states that bis observations account for the fact that
the convex side grows quicker, not merely than the concave, but than a normal
unbent shoot. But he does not seem to have compared the thickness of the convex
cell-walls with the normal, although he states that they are poorer in protoplasm

than is usual, and from this it may, according to his views, be perhaps assumed
that the membranes are abnormally thin.

     Wortmann points out that his views account for two well-known features in
growth curvatures, viz., the latent period and the after-effect. If a curvature can
only occur when a difi'erence in structure of cell-walls has arisen, it is certainly
natural that some time should occur before the curvature is apparent. I do not
lay much stress on this part of the subject, as I feel sure the whole question of

latent period needs further investigation. "With regard to after-eilect it is true
that AVortmaim's views account for the continuance of curvature after the stimulus

has ceased to act.

    Wortmann attaches great importance to another point in his theory, which,
could it be established, would be of the greatest interest, and would unite under a
common point of view, not only acellular and multicellular organs, but also naked
protoplasm, e.g. the plasmodia of myxomycetes. The view in question was tenta-
tively suggested by 8ach?,- and mentioned by Pfefl'er ^ in a similar spirit. The

apogeotropic curvature of a phycomyces-hypha is supposed to be due to the
unequal thickening of the membrane on the upper and lower sides, and this to
be due to tlie migration of protoplasm from the lower to the upper side of the
cell. In the same way in a multicellular organ the protoplasm is supposed to
migrate from the lower cortex and ])ith to the upper cortex and pith, such

migration being rendered possible by the now generally admitted intercellular
protoplasmic communication. Thus the apogeotropism of a cell or a multicellular
part would be due to the apogeotropism or tendency to migrate vertically upwards
of the protoplasm. There are great difficulties in the way of accepting this

attractive theor)-.

     Noll * states that when a curved phycomyces-hypha, in which protoplasm has
accumidated in the upper (concave) side, is reversed so that the mass of protoplasm
is below, it does not migrate upward again, as might be expected. Moreover he

points out that in Nitella and in Bryopsis the circulating protoplasm continues in
movement, and does not accumulate in any part of the cell. Lastly, there seems,
as Noll points out, a difficulty in believing in the migration of protoplasm through
the very minute pores by which the plasmic strands pass from cell to cell. There
seems much probability in Noll's view that the plasmic strands only serve for the
passage of impulses, or molecular changes, and that they consist of ectoplasm alone,

not of the endoplasm which Wortmann describes as the migratory constituent of

the cell.

     Wortmann's theory has been criticised by Elfving.'' The essence of Elfving's
paper is that appearances similar to those described by Wortmann can be produced
by curvatures not due to stimulation. Thus, when I'hycomyces is made to grow
against a glass plate it is mechanically forced to bend. Yet here, where there is

no question of stimulation, the plasma collects along the concave side of the ceU.

' Both protoplasmic change and thickening of cell-walls occur to some extent in

the pith.

Elfving concludes that the visible changes are the result and not the cause of the
curvature. Elfving also produced curvature in Phaseolus by bending the apex of
the plant towards its base and tying in that position. Under these conditions the

convex side of the shoot showed the changes described by Wortmann in geotropic
plants. Here again Elfving gives reason to believe that the thickening of the

cell-walls is a result, not of curvature, but of strain mechanically produced.

When a plant is prevented from executing an apogeotropic movement it is clear

that a longitudinal strain is put on the upper (concave) side. But the longitudinal
strain in Elfving's plants is on the convex side. Therefore, if, as Elfving believes,

the visible changes are due to strain, they should, as they do, occur on the convex
side in his experiments, on the concave in Wortmann's.

     AVortmann replied in the ' Bot. Zeitung,' 1888, p. 469, and attempted to explain
how Elfving's results might be explained and yet his own theory hold good. The
reply is by no means so strong as the criticism, and it must be allowed that
Elfving has seriously shaken Wortmann's argument.

     Somewhat similar criticisms have been made by Noll.^ In the acellular plants,
Derbesia and Bryopsis, Noll studied growth-curvatures, and was quite unable to
detect any thickening of the concave cell-walls, except when the curvatures were

very sudden, and in these cases the result could equally well be produced by

mechanical bending.
     Noll further points out what is undoubtedly a fault in Wortmann's theory,

namely, that he explains the retardation on the concave rather than acceleration
on the convex side. This criticism is only partially just, for though Wortmann's
description only shows a relative thinness of the walls on the convex side, yet it ia
clear he believed there to be an absolute diminution of resisting power on that

side.

     Noll's experiments with grass-halms show clearly that acceleration of growth
on the convex side is the primary change, rather than retardation along the concave
lialf. Wlien the halms are fixed in horizontal glass tubes, so that they are stimu-
lated but unable to bend, the lower half of the pulvinus forms an irregular out-

growth, increasing radially since it is not able to increase longitudinally.

   A similar argument may be drawn from Elfving's experiments. He found that

the pulvini of grass-halms placed on the klinostat increase in length. This experi-
ment shows incidentally that the klinostat does not remove but merely distribute

equally the geotropic stimulus : also that geotropic stimulus leads to increased, not

to diminished growth. The same thing is proved by the simple fact that a grass

halm shows no growth in its pulvinus while it is vertical, so that when curvature

begins (on its being placed horizontal) it must be due to acceleration on the convex,

since there is no growth on the concave side in which retardation could occur.

Noll's view is that the primarj' change is an increase in extensibility of the tissues

Aon the convex side. This view he proceeded to test experimentally.  growing

shoot was fixed in a vertical position, and a certain bending force was applied to

make it curve out of the vertical, first to the right and then to the left. If the

cortical tissues are, at the beginning of the experiment, equally resisting all round,

it is clear that the excursions from the vertical to the right and left will be equal.
As a matter of fact the excursions to the right and left were nearly the same, and
the difference was applied as a correction to the subsequent result. The shoot was
then placed horizontally until geotropic or other curvature was just beginning,

when the above bending experiment was repeated. It was then found that when
it was bent so that the lower side was made convex, the excursion was greater
than it had been. In the few experiments given by Noll the excursion in the
opposite direction (stretching of the concave side) was less than it had been, and
he states that all the other experiments showed a similar result. The increased
extensibility of the convex side is clearly the most striking part of the phenomenon,
but I fail to see why Noll takes so little notice of the diminution in the extensi-
bility of the concave side, which is only mentioned towards the end of his paper.*
Yet such a diminution is a necessary factor in the mechanism of curvature. It
«hould be noted that results like Noll's might be obtained under other conditions

of growth-curvatures. Thus if De Vries' view were the true one and the curvature
·were due to difference in osmotic force on the convex and concave sides, the shoot
would react differently in the two directions ; for instance, the concave side would
be the more easily compressed. Noll and Wortmann's explanations differ in
this : the former lays the greater stress on the increased extensibility of the convex
side, the latter on the diminution of that of the concave side. Apain, Wortmann

explains the difference in extensibility as due to differences in thickness of the

cell-walls. Noll gives no mechanical explanation, but assumes that the ectoplasm
has the power of producing changes in the quality of the cell-wall in some unknown

     In the early stages of curvature, a phenomenon takes place to which Noll

attaches great" importance as supporting his view. When a curved organ is
plasmolysed, it sutlers a diminution of curvature, as De Vries showed, but Noll

has proved that in the early stages of curvature a contrary movement occurs, that
is to say, the curvature is increased. This seems to show that the yielding of the
convex side is owing to a ductility, which prevents its holding its own against the
more perfect elasticity of the concave side. But this is only the beginning of the
phenomenon ; as the plasmolysing agent continues to act, a reverse movement takes
place, the well-known flattening of the curvature described by De Vries. It is to
me incomprehensible how in a given condition of cell-walls these results can occur
in different stages of plasmolysis. I can understand one occurring when the curva-
ture is recent, and the other, the flattening of the curve, occurring when the ductile
convex parts have reacquired elasticity. The fact undoubtedly is as Noll describes
it : his explanation seems to me inadequate.

    "NVe have now seen that the most acceptfible theory of the machinery of these

curvatures is in its main features akin to Ilofmeister's, the power of elongation
supplying the motive force, while the varying extensibility of the membranes

determines the nature and direction of the bend.

     The question now arises : Is it possible by these means to account for all tlie

-- --facts that must be explained. Taking the theory for which there is most to be

said on experimental grounds viz., Noll's it will be noted that it is essentially
connected with the doctrine of growth by apposition. The question, therefore,
whether the apposition-theory is suflicient to account for the phenomena of

ordinary growth, may be applied mutatis mutandis to growth curvature. This

doctrine in its original purity absolutely requires turgescence to account for the
elon"-ation of growth. The 'older layers, separated from the ectoplasm by the

younger layers of cell-wall, can only be elongated by traction, (irowth by intus-

susception does not absolutely require this force ; the theory that the micelkx) are
separated by traction, and thus allow intercalation of fresh micella^, is a view for

which Sachs is chiefly responsible.
     Since surface-growth by apposition is absolutely dependent on the traction

--exercised by cell-pressure, it is a fair question how far growth is influenced by

forcible elongation. Baranetzky - states that when a plant is subject to traction,
as by even a small weight attached to the free end, the rate of growth is lowered.
Ambronn,^ as Zimmermanu points out in the same connection, found no increased
elongation of collenchyma when stretched for some days by means of a weight.

A o-reater difficulty is that growth may be absolutely and at once stopped by

placing the growing organ in an atmosphere free from oxygen.'' Such treatment
apparently does not diminish turgescence, yet growth stops. If the cell-walls are
increasing in length by mechanical stretching, and if the turgor is not interfered
with, increase in length ought to continue. The same thing applies to curvatures.
"Wortmann has shown ^ that in an atmosphere of pure hydrogen a geotropic
curvature which has begun in ordinary air cannot continue ; in other words, after-

effect ceases. This seems to me inexplicable on Noll's or Wortmann's theories

the convex side has become more extensible than the concave, turgescence, as

far as we know, continues, yet no after-effect is observed. The same result may

be gathered from Askenasy's ' interesting experiments on the growth of roots.

He showed that lowering the temperature has an almost instantaneous inhibitive

eft'eet on growth. Thus maize roots (at a temperature of 26'6°) growing at the

rate of 33 divisions of the micrometer per hour, were placed in water at 5°, and

absolutely no growth occurred during the following ten minutes, in which the

thermometer rose to 6-5. This result is to some extent more valuable because we

know from Askenasy's - other results that the turgor, as estimated by plasmolytic

shortening, is about the same whether the root is in full growth or not growing at

all. This, however, is not conclusive, for if the growing cell-walls were ductile they

might shorten but little although under great pressure, whereas the non-growing

cells might shorten a good deal, owing to their more perfect elasticity ; ^ therefore,

Askenasy's plasmolytic results are not in this particular connection of great

importance, except as showing that the non-growing roots were certainly to some

extent turgesceut.

    There are other facts which make it extremely difficult to understand how

surface-growth can depend on cell-pressure. Nageli * pointed out that the growth

of cylindrical cells which elongate enormously without bulging outwards laterally,

Anis not explicable by simple internal pressure.  internodal cell of Nitella

increases to 2,000 times its original length, while it only becomes ten times

as wide as it was at first. The filaments of Spirogyra become very long, and keep

their orginal width. Nageli found that in Spirogyra the shortening produced by

plasmolysis was practically the same in the longitudinal and in the transverse

direction. He therefore concluded that the growth of Spirogyra cannot be

accounted for by the cell-wall being differently extensible along different axes.

But it must once more be pointed out that this type of plasmolytic experiment has

not the force which Nageli ascribes to it. If the cell-wall stretched like putty in

one direction and like india-rubber in the other, there might be no plasmolytic

shortening in the line of greatest growth. Nevertheless, in spite of this flaw in

Niigeli's argument, great elongation in a single direction remains a problem for

those who believe in surface-growth by apposition.

The point of special interest is that differences in extensibility in different

directions cannot be supposed to exist in a homogeneous membrane. If any purely

physical characters can explain the facts, they must be architectural characters.
That is to say, we must be able to appeal to remarkable structural differences along
different axes if we are to explain the facts. Such structural differences do, of
course, exist, but whether they are sufficient to account for the phenomena is

a different question. Strasburger '" supposes that the elasticity of a cell-wall

depends on the last-formed layers, and as in these the microsomes are seen

arranging themselves in lines or patterns, we have a heterogeneity of structure
which may or may not be sufficient.

   We have now seen that it is difficult to believe, although it is not incon-

ceivable, that the extending force of cell-turgor, combined with differences in

extensibility of the membranes (depending on structural characters), may account

for the phenomena of rectilinear growth. But, even if we allow that this is so.

Low are we to apply the same explanation to growth-curvatures ? How are we to

account for the rapid changes in extensibility necessary to produce geotropic or

heliotropic curvatures ? The influences which Strasburger and Noll suppose to act
on the cell-walls and render them ductile cannot account for extensibility in one

direction only. Nor does Wortmann's theory, that difference in extensibility depends
on difference in thickness, meet the case completely. What we need is an increase

in lono-itudinal, not in general extensibilitj'. I presume that these writers might
say that the excess in longitudinal extensibility is always present whether general

extensibility is greater or less. In the meanwhile we must pass on to more

recent researches connected with surface-growth by apposition.
     In Strasburger's later work, ' Histologische Beitriige,' 1889, his views on growth

have undergone considerable modification. The study of certain epidermic cells,
of the folds in membranes, and the I'epetition of Krabbe's work on certain
bast fibres, have convinced him that apposition does not account for all forms of

o-rowth. Krabbe ' showed that in full-grown sclerenchyma {e.g. in Oleander)
local widenings occur without any such amount of thinning in the membrane as
would occur if the bulging were due to stretching. The only possible explanation
seems to be that there is a migration of new material into the cell-wall. Such
intussusception might be, as Niigeli supposed, a flow of fluid out of which new
micellae crystallise ; but it is now established that cellulose arises as a modification

of protoplasm, so that it would harmonise with our knowledge of the origin of
cellulose if we assume that intussusception was preceded by a wandering of proto-
plasm into the cell-wall. Such a state of things would render possible the
regulation of longitudinal growth in the case of Is^itella and Spirogyra, already

alluded to, as well as in growth curvatures. This view might also harmonise with

Wiesner's " theory that the ceU-wall contains protoplasm as long as it continues to

grow.

For the sake of brevity I content myself with the above examples : I think it

will be allowed that there is a focussing of speculation from many sides in favour

--of ' active ' surface-growth or, what is perhaps a better way of putting it, in

favour of a belief that the extension of cell membranes depends on physiological

rather than physical properties, that it is in some way under the immediate

Wecontrol of the protoplasm.  may take our choice between Wiesner's wall-

protoplasm (dermatoplasm), protoplasmic intussusception as conceived by Stras-

burger, or the action of the ectoplasm in the manner suggested by Yines,^ who

suppose.s that the crucial point is a change in the motility of the protoplasm, not

of the cell membrane. The latter theory would undoubtedly meet the difficulties

if we could believe that so yielding a substance as protoplasm could resist the force

of turgor.

     The great difficulty is, it seems to me, that since e.g. in Oaulerpa, surface-gi-owth

is clearly due to stretching, as Noll has demonstrated, and since in osmotic cell-pres-
sure a stretching force does exist, it cannot be doubted that turgor, and ordinary
physical extensibility are conditions of the problem. This remains true in spite of
Klebs'* curious observations on the growth of plasmolysed algse, or in spite

of the fact that pollen tubes may grow without turgor, in spite of the same
being perhaps true of young cells filled with protoplasm.^ In the face of all these
facts, osmotic pressure in the cell must remain a vera causa tending to surface-

growth.

    If we accept some form of · active ' surface-growth, we must deal with turgor in
another way, although to do so may require a violent exercise of the imagina-

tion. Are we to believe, for instance, that the function of turgescence is the
attaining of mechanical strength? If we hold that cell-walls increase in area

independently of turgor, we shall be forced to invent a hypothesis such as the

--following which I am far from intending to uphold. It is possible to imagine

that the function of the force of turgor is merely to spread out the growing mem-

brane to its full extent, and, as it were, to make the most of it. Turgor would in

this respect play the part occupied by the frame used in embroidery, making it easier

to carry on the work satisfactorily, hut not being absolutely necessary. When

mechanical strength is gained by turgor (as in Mucor), instead of by brute strength

of material, as in a tree-trunk, a great economy in cellulose is effected. If turgor

played our hypothetical part of smoothing out the membrane and insuring that

it shall occupy as large a space as possible, it would effect the same kind of

economy.

It is not necessary to inquire how far this hypothesis accords with our know-

ledge of cell mechanics. It is only put forth as an example of the difficulties in

by diffiiculties ; for, though the theories which are classed together as protoplasmic

have much in their favour, they, too, lead us into an imimsse.

                                 Circumnutation.

I shall conclude by saying a few words about the theory of growth-curvatures

put forward in the ' Power of Movement in Plants.' I can here do no more than

discuss the relation of circumnutation to curvature, which is the thesis of the book

in question, without attempting to enter the arena with regard to the many

objections which have been raised to other parts of our work.

    A distinguished botanist, Professor Wiesner, of Vienna, published in 1881 a

book, ' Das Bewegungsvermogen der Pflanzen,' entirely devoted to a criticism of

the ' Power of Movement.' It is founded on a long series of experiments, and is

written throughout in a spirit of fairness and candour which gives it value, apart

from its scientific excellence, as a model of scientific criticism. The words

mywi'itten on the title-page of the copy presented to      father are character-
--istic of the tone of the book : ·' In getreuer Opposition, aber in imwandelbarer

AVerehrung.'   letter printed among my father's correspondence shows how

warmly he appreciated his opponent's attack both as to matter and manner.

"Wiesner's opposition is far-reaching, and includes the chief theoretical conclusion

of the book, namely, that movements such as heliotropism and geotropism are

modifications of circumnutation. Neither will he allow that this revolving nuta-

tion is the widely-spread phenomenon we held it to be. According to "Wiesner,

many parts of plants which do not ciicumnutate are capable of curving geo-

tropicaUy, &c. ; he is, therefore, perfectly justified, from his own point of view,

in refusing to believe that such curvatures are derivations from circumnutation.

He points out that our method of observing circumnutation is inaccurate, inasmuch

as the movement is recorded in oblique projection. This we were aware of,' and

I cannot but think that Wiesner has unintentionally exaggerated its inaccuracy
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

and that, if used with reasonable discretion, it cannot lead to .anything like such

faulty records as in the supposititious cases given by our critic. However this may

be, Wiesner's results are perhaps more trustworthy than ours, and should receive

the most careful consideration.

Wiesner's conclusions, taken from his own summaries, are as follows :

The movement described as circumnutation is not a wide-spread phenomenon in

plants. Stems, leaves, and acellular fungi are to be found which grow in a per-

fectly straight line. Some roots grow for considerable periods of time without
deviating from the vertical. When circumnutation does occur, it cannot be

considered to have the significance given to it in the ' Power of Movement.' The

--movements observed by Wiesner are explained by him in three different ways:

i. As the expression of a certain irregularity in growth depending on the want

of absolute symmetry in structure, and on the fact that the component cells of the

organ have not absolutely similar powei-s of growth.

ii. As the expression of opposing growth -tendencies. Thus certain organs have

inherent tendencies to curve in definite planes^for instance, the bending of the

hypocotyl in the plane of the cotyledons. Wiesner believes that such tendencies,

--when combined with others heliotropic, geotropic, &c.--lead to alternate bendings

in opposite directions, according as one or other of the components is temporarily

the stronger,

iii. Wiesner allows that circumnutation does exist in some cases. This last

class Le considers a small one; he states, indeed, tliat 'nearlj^ all, especially the

clearly perceptible circumnutations,' are comLined movemeuts belonging to the

second of the above categories.

Although I have perhaps no right to such an opinion without repeating

Wiesner's worli, yet I must confess that I cannot give up the belief that cireumnu-

tation is a widely-spread phenomenon, even though it may not be so general as

we supposed.

     If, then, circumnutation is of any importance wo are forced to ask what is its
relation to growth-curvatures. It was considered by my father to be ' the basis

or groundwork for the acquirement, according to the requirements of the plant, of

Athe most diversified movements.' ' lie also wrote : - ' considerable difficulty in

the way of evolution is in part removed, for it might be asked how did all these

diversified movement.^ . . . . first arise .'^ As the case stands, we Imow that there
is always movement in progress, and its amplitude, direction, or both, have only to

be modified for the good of the plant in relation to internal or external stimuli.'

    Those who have no belief in tlie importance of circumnutation, and who hold
that movements may have arisen without any such bisis, may doubtless be

justified in their position. I quite agree that movement mirjlit be developed

without circumnutation having anything to do witli the matter. But in seeking

the origin of growth-curvatures it is surely rational to look for a widely-

spread movement existing in varying degrees. Tbis, as I believe, we have in cir-

cumnutation : and liere comes in what seems to me to be characteristic of the

evolution of a quality such as movement. In the evolution of structure, each

individual represents merely a single one of the units on which selection acts.

But an individual which executes a number of movements (which may be purpose-

less) supplies in itself the material out cf which various adapted movements

may arise. I do not wish to imply that tentative movements are of the same

order of importance as variations, but they are undoubtedly of importance as

indic^ation of variabilit}'.

The problem may be talcen back a stnge further ; we may ask why circumnuta-

Whytion should exist. In the ' Power of Movement ' (p. 546) we -wrote : *       every

part of a plant whilst it is growing, and in some cases after growth has ceased,

should haA'e its cells rendered more turgescent and its cell-walls more extensile

first on one side then on another ... is not Imown. It would appear as if the

changes in the cells required periods of rest.' Such periods of comparative rest are

fairly harmonious with any theory of growth ; it is quite conceivable by intus-

susceptionists and appositionists alike that the two stages of elongation and fixation

should go on alternately,' but this would not necessarily lead to circumnutation. It

might simply result in a confused struggle of cell.*, in some of which extension, in
others elongation, was in the ascendant ; but such a plan would be an awkward

arrangement, since each cell would hinder or be hindered by its neighbour. Per-

fection of growth could only be attained when groups of contiguous cells agreed

to work together in gangs, that is, to pass through similar stages of growth syn-

chronou.sly. Then, if the diflferent gangs were in harmony, each cell would have

fair play, elongation would proceed equally all round, and the result would be

circumnutation.' Whether or no any such origin of circumnutation as is here

sketched maybe conceived, there can be no doubt that it had its origin in the laws

of growth apart from its possible utilisation as a basis for growth-curvature.

     It is, however, possible to look at it from a somewhat different point of view,

namely, in connection with what Vochting has called rectipetality!' He made out

the fact that when an organ has been allowed to curve geotropically, helio-

tropicall}', &c., and is then removed from further stimulation by being placed on

the klinostat, it becomes straight again. This fact suggested to Vochting his
conceptioD of rectipetality, a regulating power leading to growth in a straight line.

It may be objected that such a power is nothing more than the heredity, -which
moulds the embryo into the likeness of its parent, and by a similar power insists

that the shoot or root shall take on the straight form necessary to its specific
character. But the two cases are not identical. The essence of rectipetality is the

power of recovering from disturbance caused by external circumstances. When an

organ has been growing more quickly on one side than another, tlie regulating

power reverses this state of things and brings the curving organ back towards
the starting-point. AVe have no means of knowing how this regulating power
acts in undisturbed growth. It is possible to imagine a type of irritability which
would insure growth being absolutely straight, but it is far more easy to conceive
growth as normally made up of slight departures from a straight line, constantly
corrected. In drawing a line with a pencil, or in walking towards a given point,

we execute an approximately straight line by a series of corrections. If we may
judge in such a matter by our own experience, it is far more conceivable that

the plant should perceive the fact that it is not growing absolutely straight and
correct itself, than that it should have a mysterious power of growing as if its free
end were guided by an external force along a straight-edge. The essence of the

matter is this: we know from experiments that a power exists of correcting

excessive unilateral growth artificially produced ; is it not probable that normal
growth is similarly kept in an approximately straight line by a series of aberrations
and corrections ? If this is so, circumnutation and rectipetality would be difierent
aspects of the same thing.

     This would have one interesting corollary: if we fix our attention on the
regulating power instead of on the visible departures from the straight line, it is
clear that we can imagine an irritability to internal growth-changes existing in
varying intensities. With great irritability very small departures from the
straight line would be corrected. With a lower irritability the aberration would
be greater before they are corrected. In one case the visible movement of
circumnutation would be very small, in the other case large, but the two processes
would be the same. The small irregular lateral curvatures which Wiesner allows
to exist, would therefore be practically of the same value as regular circumnutation,
which he considers comparatively rare.

     The relation between rectipetality and circumnutation may be exemplified by

Aan illustration which I have sometimes made use of in lecturing on this point.

sldlful bicycle-rider runs very straight, the deviations from the desired course are
comparatively small ; whereas a beginner ' wobbles ' or deviates much. But the
deviations are of the same nature both are symptoms of the regulating power of

                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

the rider.

   We may carry the analogy one step further : just as growth-curvature is the

continuance or exaggeration of a nutation in a definite direction, so when the rider
curves in his course he does so by wilful exaggeration of a ' wobble.'

    It may be said that circumnutation is here reduced to the rank of an acci-
dental deviation from a right line. But this does not seem necessarily the case.

A bicycle cannot be ridden at all unless it can ' wobble,' as every rider knows who

has allowed his wheel to run into a frozen rut. In the same way it is possible
that some degree of circumnutation is correlated with growth in the manner

suggested above, owing to the need of regular pauses in growth. Rectipetality
would thus be a power by which irregularities, inherent in growth, are reduced
to order and made subservient to rectilinear growth, Circumnutation would
be the outward and visible sign of the process.

    I feel that some apology is due from me to my hearers for tlie introduction
of so much speculative matter. It may, however, have one good result, for it
shows how difficult is the problem of growth-curvature, and how much room there

still is for work in this field of research.

8. Non-sexual Formation of Spores in the Desmidiacece.

                     By A. W. Bennett.

In at least two gatherings of Desmids from the neighbourhood of Hindhead in

Surrey, I have come across a phenomenon which I am not aware has been recorded

before in this family of Algae, viz. the formation of parthenospores without conju-

gation. The species was in all cases Closterimn lanceolatum, Ktz., and I have at

present seen four examples of it. In two of them one spore, in the other two

two spores, were formed within the frond. They appeared spherical or ellipsoidal

according to the view in which they were seen, and with perfectly smooth surface.

The fronds were distinctly alive, and the longitudinal chlorophyll-bands had under-

gone but little change from their ordinary form, except where interrupted by the

Aintervention of the spore.  similar phenomenon has been recorded in the allied

Zygnemaceie.

9. On a simple Ap)paratus for the Cultivation of small organisms in Hang-
    ing Drops, and in various Oases, under the Microscope. By Pro-
     fessor Marshall Ward, F.R.S.

     The author has found it necessary to devise a culture-chamber capable of sup-
plying relatively large quantities of gases to the ordinary hanging-drop cultiva-
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.  679

tions of yeasts, bacteria, &c. ; it must also Ibe firm, strong, and readily taken to
 pieces and sterilised by beat.

     He bas accomplished this by taking; a piece of thick-walled glass tubing, about
^ incb in diameter and 3 incbes long ; the two ends are softened and slightly drawn
to narrow tubes, not too thin. The piece of glass now looks like a narrow tube with a
 tbick- walled bulb in the middle. One face of this central bulb is then ground flat,

until a bole about ^ incb in diameter is cut through ; a similar hole is then ground

in tbe opposite face of tbe bulb. The apparatus is now ready to be put togetber.
     It is sterilisedat 150° 0., and cemented by paraffin (or by gelatine in acetic acid),

by one of the ground faces, to a broad glass slide properly sterilised. Sterilised cot-
ton-wool is stuti'ed into the two narrow tubulures, and tbe banging-drop culture,
properly prepared on a sterile coverslip is cemented (by means of sterilised oil,

vaseline, or paraffin, &c.) over tbe upper hole of the chamber.

     The apparatus is now ready for use if the culture is required in air only ; a
slow diflusion of air and retardation of evaporation may be insured by simply wet-

ting the cotton-wool in tbe tubulures with pure water.

      If it is necessary to pass gases into the culture, one of tbe stuffed tubulures is
connected by means of caoutchouc tubing (sterilised in corrosive sublimate, abso-
lute alcohol, and boiling) with the appropriate gas apparatus. The pressure can
be regulated by the stuffing in this, the proximal tubulure, and by clip or screw-
taps. The stuffed exit tubulure is also protected by caoutcbouc tubing and a clip.

     If a very strong cover-slip and careful cementing are employed, the autbor finds
tbat a very good partial vacuum can be obtained, and even retained for some
hours. This is A-ery useful in cases where it is necessary to remove the oxygen or

carbon-dioxide from tbe imprisoned atmosphere. This may be accomplished more
or less readily by attaching bulbs containing an alkaline solution of pyrogallic

acid, or a solution of potassium hydrate. Obviously the apparatus can also be used
for testing the effect of poisonous gases, or for observing the action of light of
different intensities, or of various low temperatures, and so forth. Obviously, also,

it may be used for testing the action of different coloured lights, and of darkness,

&c., with certain simple modifications, e.ff. employing different coloured glass
tubing, or opalescent or blackened glass for making tbe culture-chamber, and

adding various screens, covers, &c., as required.

    11. On the Progress of the Investigation of the Natural History of the
                        Friendly Islands. By J. J. Lister.

     At tbe meeting of tbe British Association at Bath in September 1888, a Com-
mittee was appointed for the purpose of taking steps for the investigation of the
Natural History of tbe Friendly Islands and other groups in the Pacific visited by

H.M.S. Efieria.
     I was then starting to join the Egeria, and a grant of 100/. was voted to assist

me in carrying out tbe object of tbe Committee. At tbe next meeting tbe Com-
mittee reported tbat I had joined the Egeria on ber arrival at Tonga and was
carrying on my researches.

     I beg leave" to offer the following brief account of tbe further steps that I took

in pursuance of my object.

      H.M.S. Egeria arrived at Tongatabu on IMay 23, 1889, and after a short visit
to tbe neighbouring island of Eua, I left Tonga for a cruise among the islands
lying to the northward, between Tongatabu and the Equator.

     In tbe course of this cruise the Egeria called twice at Samoa, and also visited
Viti Levu, the principal island in Fiji, and made surveys of Fakaofu in the Union
Group, and Canton (or Mary) Island in the Phoenix Group, besides touching at

several of the neighbouring islands.
--680 REPORT 1891.

On returning to Tonga I had the opportunity of visiting Falcon Island, -which

was thrown up hy volcanic eruption in 1885, and some of the other less accessible

islands of the group.

    After the departure of the Egeria in November, I paid two visits to the Vavau

Islands in the northern part of the Tonga group, and owing to the courtesy of

Mr. S. Parker of Eua I stayed two weeks with him on that island.

I finally left Tonga on April 24, 1890, and returned to England at the end of

Mythe following September.  collections have been disposed of as follows :

The geological specimens have been placed in the Woodwardian Museum at

Cambridge. Specimens of the skins and eggs of the rarer birds and my collections

                       By J. G. Gkenfell, F.G.S., F.U.M.S.

     The diatoms are two small species of MeJo-nra and Cyclotella Kiitzingiana,
which occur mainly as isolated frustules and are non-motile. They have been
found in London, Hertfordshire, and "Wiltshire. The pseudopodia are delicate,
often invisible till the material is dried on a cover glass. Comparatively thick ones
are occasionally found. Gentian violet and methylene blue are good stains for
them. The pseudopodia are apparently non-retractile, generally straight, some-
times branched, but those of the earliest gathering in April were often repeatedly
branched. Their number is fairly constant. Most of them are placed fairly sym-
metrically round the edge of the valves. The length varies from two-and-a-balf
to nine times the diameter of the frustule. The diatoms are sometimes connected
by broad bands which seem to be anastomosed pseudopodia. Very similar bands

are found amongst the Heliozoa. Tlie protoplasmic nature of the pseudopodia is
inferred from the following facts :

     They are destroyed by nitric acid and by a low red heat; they give no cellulose
reaction with Schultze's solution or with iodine and sulphuric acid ; they stain
readily with Kleinenberg's hsematoxyliu ; they also stain with borax carmine,
picro-nigrosin and alcoholic saftranin. Pseudopodia similar in shape are found
amongst the Heliozoa generally, but pseudopodia agreeing with these in the
minutest details are found on some specimens of Archerina lioltoni, a Heliozooia
which occurred in vast numbers with the diatoms in London. Other as yet un-
determined Heliozoa occurring in the same water have verj' similar pseudopodia.

3. On Nuclear Structure in the Bacteria. By Harold Wagee.

Owing to the small size of the cells in the bacteria, the presence of a nucleus,

or of anything akin to nuclear structure in them, has not yet been satisfactorily

demonstrated. Dr. P. Ernst, has, however, described certain bodies which to him

appeared to be of the nature of nuclei, inasmuch as they possessed a reaction

towards reagents diflerent from that observed in spores.

It is interesting to note that in the closely allied group of the Cyanophycece,

Scott and Zacharias have been able to detect structures resembling a nucleus.

According to Eiitschli, the central portion of the protoplasmic contents of the

bacterium cell is to be regarded as of the nature of a nucleus, in that it takes up

very readily certain aniline dyes. It should be noted, however, that such stains

as hfematoxylin, carmine, saflranin have but little staining power for the contents

of the bacterium cell, compared with such stains as gentian violet, fuchsin, &c.,

which stain them deeply, but which also stain the protoplasm of the cells of higher

plants almost as deeply as the contents of the bacterium cell. This seems to show

that the bacteria contain very little of the chromatic substance which is found in

the nuclei of the higher plants. The author of this paper has for some time

been working at the bacteria in the hope of elucidating this point, and has

obtained a bacillus in which a distinct nuclear structure can be observed.

The bacillus referred to forms a thin scum on the surface of water containing

Spirogyra in a state of decay. The cells, which consist of short rods, occur either

singly or in pairs. They are about 2-5 to 3 |t in length, and from 1-3 to 1'5 ^i in
diameter, and when seen in a fresh state one or more brightly refractive granules

can be observed in each cell. In cover-glass preparations stained witli fuchsin, all

stages in the division of the bacillus could be observed. The preparations should

be made during the earlier stages of the development of the scum on the surface of

the water, while the bacillus is in a healthy state of division.

In the centre of each cell a substance deeply stained by the fuchsin is Jibund.

This in young cells consists of two rods placed side by side, with a less deeply

stained substance between them, the whole being surrounded by a very thin

membrane which is only visible at the two ends. This is the structure which we
may call a nucleus. It is surrounded by a space containing a substance which is

only slightly stainable, and this again is surrounded by a deeply-stained membrane,

outside which is the slightly stained gelatinous envelope. Previous to its division

the cell elongates ; the nucleus also elongates and contracts slightly about the

Amiddle of its length.  dumb-bell shaped structure is thus obtained. The two

rods divide completely, so as to form two groups, containing two rods each, which

remain connected together for some time by the less deeph'-stained portion of the

nucleus. The constriction becomes more and more pronounced, until finally the

"ywo halves of the nucleus are completely separated. The outer capsule or cell-

wall has meanwhile been contracting towards the middle, the contraction keeping

pace with the division of the central mass. This contraction goes on until at a

certain stage a delicate transverse partition appears, dividing it into two ; each

half contains one of the halves of the original nucleus. Ultimately the two halves

become completely separated, and two new cells are formed.

In the majority of cases the cells are completely separated before the division
682 EEPOET-- 1891.

of the nucleus aj^ain begins, but in many instances llie nuclear rods were seen to
be dividing in cells which were still connected with each other.

     After a time the division of the cells takes place less rapidly, and finally ceases
altogether. The division of the nucleus becomes very irregular, and at the time

when cell division has ceased the nucleus has become broken up into granules which

are distributed irregularly in the contents of the cell.
     This breaking up of the nucleus appears to be preliminary to the formation of

spores, although the formation of spores has not been satisfactorily observed.

   A Discussion was held on the Systematic Position of certain Organisms

       that are regarded hy some Naturalists as Animals, and by otliera as

         Plants.

SATUBDAT, AUGUST 22.

The following Papers were read :

1. On Anatomical Nomenclature. By Professor W. Krause, Gottingen.

    The subject of the paper, ' Anatomical Nomenclature,' may seem to be only of

interest to the anatomist in the dissecting-room. This is, however, an error, for

the names of several parts of the body occur in every branch of Biological Science,

Zoology, Embryology, &c., and especially in the practice of Medicine and Surgery.

There have been and there are many complaints that a great many parts of the

--body have not one but several difterent anatomical names, for instance conarium,

pineal body, epiphysis. This state of things has every year become worse and

worse ; in Germany, especially, it has become almost insupportable.
    The reason is obvious. Germany was and is not united in the administration

of the internal aflkirs of the single states, and every state, and even every little
university, has had and has to-day its own anatomical nomenclature. If one com-

pares the anatomical papers and the handbooks of different nations, one meets with
the same difficulties. In Germany, however, there are still greater difficulties to

face. Here in the same university sometimes different anatomical nomenclatures
exist. Much time and labour are lost by student and teacher owing to these

diflerences.

     This labour is completely lost, because it is and it must be of little importance
whether this or that name be given to a particular muscle or a particular artery.
Sometimes confusion and misunderstandings arise, but the worst is that the mere

reader is unwilling or does not care to translate the anatomical terms of an author,

foreigner or otherwise, into his own anatomical terminology. So reading becomes

superficial ; the reader understands the words but not the real meaning of the

author. This state of things cannot last, and so a Committee has been elected for
preparing, not a new one, but at least a homogeneous nomenclature. This Com-

mittee consists of seventeen anatomists, of whom twelve are Germans and four or

five from other countries. Sir William Turner from Edinburgh and Professor
Cunningham from Dublin represent Great Britain. This Committee has begun to
work in earnest, and has already done much. The author referred to a little

paper, only three pages, which contains nothing but the names of the muscles of

the human body, but much work had to be done before it was completed. Now

Germans can, at least, answer the question, if a foreigner should ask, ' What is

Athe German name for a certain muscle ? '  year ago no German anatomist could

have given any answer but ' I do not know, some call it the trapezius, others the
cucullaris.' In conclusion, the author said, ' In two or three years we shall have
finished the whole, and then we shall ask the anatomists of other countries to

give their candid opinion on the results of our labours.'

    Some general principles have already been laid down by the Committee.
     Firstly : The name should be as short as possible.
                    TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.                                                 683

Secondly : Personal nomenclature should not if possible be used. There are

some anatomical names which are known in every country, as ' Hunter's canal/ but

a great many are known only in one country. There are little nodules on the

margin of the semilunar valves of the pulmonary artery : some call them ' nodes

of Arantius,' others the 'nodes of Morgagni'; but Arantius certainly never saw

them. There is a prominence on the external ear of man, in Germany known as

* Darwin's prominence,' but in England it is often called * Woolner's tip,' and so on.

Thirdly : No  part  of the  body should  have  more  than  one  name                           more
                                                                                            ;

synonyms only cause confusion. This name shall always be a Latin one ; every

nation can afterwards easily translate it after its own fashion. Latin is the only

real international language, and by adopting it we hope to have a sound

foundation.

A3. Preliminary Classification of Sexual and allied Modes of Protoplasmic

      Rejuvenescence, ^c} By Professor Maecus Haetog, M.A., D.Sc,

       F.L.S.

     I. The following modes of rejuvenescence occur in cellular and in certain apo-
cytial organisms :

     A. Plasto&amt : the fusion of cytoplasts into a plasmodium, the nuclei
               remaining free {My.vomycetes).

    B. Kaeyogamt: the union of cells (gametes), cytoplast to cytoplast and
              nucleus to nucleus, to form a 1-nucleate cell, the zygote. The following

                variations occur :

          --1. IsoGAMT. The union of gametes undistinguishable in size, form,
                     and behaviour ; this may vary as follows :

                              (rt) MxTLTiPLE : between several gametes (up to 6).
                          {b) Binary : between a pair of gametes

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

                                       or, from another point of view
                            (c) Indiffeeent : between any gametes of the species.
                           (d) ExoGAMOUs: between gametes of distinct broods only

                                                                          (

                          (e) Endogamous : between gametes of the same brood only

                                         (Hydrodictyon)

                2. Anisogamy : the union of two gametes differing chiefly in size ; the
                         smaller (micro-) gamete is 7nale, the larger {meyco-) gameie, female.

                3. Htperanisogamy : the female gamete, at first active, comes to rest
                        before fusion with the male (Lower Melanopliycets).

                4. Oogamy : The female is never actively motile ; the male is termed a

                           spermatozoon, the female an oosphere.

        --From another point of view karyogamy is

                  6. ZooiDiOGAMOUs : one gamete at least is actively motile (flagellate,
                             ciliate, or amoeboid).

                 6. SiPHONOGAMors : karyogamy is effected by a tubular outgrowth
                         from one or both of the gametes (Phaneroyams).

     ' Examples are only given in cases where it is necessary, from the introduction,
of new terms, or where the examples are not generally familiar.

II. In apocytial fuiioi multinucleated masses of protoplasm (gametoids) may
        conjugate to Ibrm a zygotoid, by a sipliODOgamous process. The union
       may be isogamous (most Mucorini), or anisogamous {M. heterogamus,
        Vuill, some Chytridiece).

III. Gametes may be classified as follows:

A. According to their formation

            1. EuscHiST : formed by repeated complete divisions from a parent cell,
                    the gametogonium.

                       (a) EuTHTSCHiST : each nuclear division is accompanied by cell

                                           division,

                       (i) Bkabtschist : the nuclear divisions are completed before .any
                                    cell division takes place (spermatozoa of Liimbricus).

                       (c) IsosCHiST : the brood-cells of a gametogonium are all equal
                                 and functional.

                      ((Z) Anisoschist : the brood cells are imequal, some of them
                                  being reduced to aborted or degraded gametes (spermatozoa
                             with ' nucleated blastophore/ ' ovum ' with polar bodies of
                                 most Metazoa).

2. IlEMiscniST : the divisions are limited to the nucleus, none occurring

in the cytoplasm (ovum with polar nuclei of many Arthropods).

3. AroscHisT : the cell divisions do nor occur, but a cell directly assumes

the  behaviour                                                   of   a  gamete    Volvo.f).

                                                                                 (

4. SYiirHYTic : the gameto-nucleus is formed by the fusion of several

nuclei (oogametes of Teronosjiorecc, isogametes of Dasgcladus).

B. According to their behaviour, as

            1. Facttltative : retaining the power of development if karyogamy

                         fails to occur.

            2. Obligatory : witli no power of independent development.

     IV. Paeagenesis will include the following modes of rejuvenescence, usually
grouped under the terms ' parthenogenesis,' ' apogamy ' {pro parte), &c. :

A. Trite Paethenogenesis : the direct development of a facultative gamete
       without karyogamy. This may occur in the case of

(1) Isogametes; (2) Anisogametes, male (microgametes of iictocrtrj^e^),

and female                                                       (3)     Oogametes (Lijjaris, drone egg).
                                                              ;

B. Simulated Paethenogenesis :

1. Cellular: a cell assumes directly the behaviour of a zygote (azy-

        gospores of Conjugattv).
2. Aroci'TjAL : a multinucleate mass of protoplasm assumes directly

       the behaviour of a zygotoid (azygospores of Mucorini).

C. Metagametal Rejuvenescence :

            1. Unicellular: a single cell in the neighbourhood of the gamete
                   assumes the form and behaviour of the zygote (formation of
                    ' ad\entitious embryos ' in embryo-sac of Funlua, Citrus, and

                          Ccclebogyne).

           2. Multicellular : a mass of cells in the position where gametes
                   should be produced, assumes the character of the young organism
                   formed by the zygote ('Apogamy 'in prothallus oi Pteris cretica,

                         &c.).

D. Paragamt or Endokartogamt : vegetative or gametal nuclei lying in a

         continuous mass of cytoplasm fuse to form a zygote nucleus.
                TKANSICTIONS OF SECTION D.                               685

1 . Progamic paragamy : the fusing nuclei are tlie normal gameto-
      nuclei of the progamous cell (ovum whicli has formed one polar
       body in Pterotrachcea, Astrojiecfen).

2. Apocytial paragamy : the vegetative nuclei of an apocytium fuse to
       form a zygote nucleus ('oospores' of Saprole(jniece).

4. On Becent Investigations of the Marine Biological Association (Fishery
                and Physical). Bij W. L. Caldekwood, Director.

  --1. Fishery Investigations. In the absence of general returns as to the increase

or decrease of any particular fishery in a given locality, we at Plymouth are from
time to time discussing the local fisheries. Papers have now been published on

the mackerel, herring, long-line, i.e. cod, conger, skate, &c., pilchard, and lobster

fisheries, the object being to shovr, as time goes on, any changes that may take

place in the relative abundance of the various fishes.

     Three investigations, started within the present year, which it is hoped will
prove of great value to the fishing population of this country, are :

     a. The attempt to produce an artificial bait for use in long-line fishing. This
investigation is being carried on by a chemist from Professor Meldola's laboratory.
Considerable advance has been already made towards a satisfactory solution of this

difficult problem.

    h. An inquiry into the occurrence of anchovies off the south-west coast of
England. At present no net small enough in the mesh to capture anchovies is

employed, but these fishes appear so often when the ordinary pilchard nets become
entangled, as to suggest that they must be present in considerable quantities.
Anchovy nets have therefore been constructed and will be used during the pilchard

season this autumn.

    Anc. investigation into the condition of the North Sea Fisheries, at present

declared to be rapidly declining :

1. To draw up a history of the North Sea trawling grounds, comparing the
         present condition with the condition, say, twenty to thirty years ago,
       when comparatively few boats were at work.

2. To continue, verify, and extend observations as to the average sizes at
        which prime fish (soles, turbot, brill) become sexually mature.

3. To collect statistics as to the sizes of all fish captured in the vicinity of
        the Dogger Banks and the region lying to the eastward, so that the
       number of immature fish aunually captured may eventually be esti-

         mated.
4. To make experiments with beam-trawl nets of various meshes, with a

        view to determine the relation, if any, between size of mesh and size

of fish taken.

--A2. Phjsical Investigations.  regular survey of the English Channel has been

commenced not only in the deep water but in the various estuaries.

   A Meteorological Station of the second order has been recently established

where observations at 9 a.m. and p.m. will be taken daily with wet and dry bulb

thermometers, barometer, rain-gauge, anemometer, and sunshine recorder.

   5. On the Groivth of Food-fishes and their Distribution at differ&nt ages.
                             By J. T. Cunningham, M.A.

    As the result of observations extended over the past two years, I have reached
some conclusions as to the rate of growth of certain food-fishes, the age at which

they begin to breed, and their distribution at diflerent ages.

   --(1) Ilate of growth and age of sexual maturitg. Numerou.? specimens of the

Flounder {Pl.flesus), were reared from the larval state in the Aquarium of the
Plymouth Laboratory. Measured in April, when a year old, they varied from 4
to 19 cm. (.about 1 i to 7^ inches). Specimens obtained in the Cattewater, and
--686 REPOBT 1891.

known to he not less tlian a year old, are from 12 to 19 cm. in length. None of
these captive flounders nor any taken in the Cattewater were sexually mature, but,
accordino-to Dr. Fulton, of the Scottish Fishery Board, sexually mature flounders

have been observed which were only 7 inches long. I conclude therefore that (a)

the rate of growth varies greatly for different individuals, but its maximum for the

first year is 19 cm. or 7^ inches, (b) sexual maturity is not reached till the end of

the second year, although the minimum size of sexually mature individuals may be

slio-htly exceeded by some specimens in one year's growth.

    I have obtained similar results for the Plaice (PL platessa) and the Dab {PI.

--limanda).
     (2) Distribution. The young of the above-mentioned species in their first year,
and of certain round fish, especially Gndus liiscus and G. 7mnutus, occur in shallow

water, within the 10-fathom line. But there has hitherto been considerable diffi-

culty in obtaining young specimens of other more valuable species in order to study
their rate of growth. These species, namely, the Sole, Turbot, Brill, Lemon Sole,

Megrim {Anioglossus megastoma), do not pass the first year of their lives in shallow

water. I have obtained young Soles in the larval state in tidal pools at Mevagissey,

and young Turbot and Brill 2 to 3 cm. in length are commonly found from June to

August in Plymouth Sound and Sutton Pool, swimming at the surface in a semi-

metamorphosed stage. Soles a little over IG cm. in length are frequently taken in

Plymouth Sound in summer ; these are just over one year old and are not sexually

mature.  Turbot 2.3 to 34 cm.  long I have  taken  in 5  to  7  fathoms                                   these  also are
                                                                                                       ;

over one year old and not sexually mature. But the yoimg stages between 3

months and 12 months old have not been taken in shallow water, and apparently

live at depths greater than 10 fathoms. It seems that our commoner and more

valuable food-fishes do not attain to sexual maturity till the end of their second

year, that their size at this age is subject to great individual variation, and that

the young in the first year of growth have a characteristic distribution. Investiga-
tion of the deeper water from this point of view is now being carried on at

Plymouth.

6. The Bejoroduction of the Pilchard. By J. T. Cunningham, M.A.

     In a paper published in the ' Journal ' of the Marine Biological Association in

1889, 1 described the egg of the Pilchard, obtained from the sea by the tow-net,

and identified by comparison with the mature egg taken from ripe female Pilchards.
The distinguishing features are four in number: (1) size r6-') to 172 mm. in

diameter, (2) the very large perivitelline space, (3) the vesicular composition of

the yolk, (4) the large single oil-globule in the yolk.

Professor Pouchet, who has studied the Sardine at the Marine Laboratory of

Concarneau, persists in denying that this egg obtained by me is that of the Pilchard,
Mybelieving that the egg of the Sardine or Pilchard is not pelagic.^
                                                                                                                 identi-

fication confirmed that suggested by Raffaelle from observations at Naples. Marion

at Marseilles ^ has entirely confirmed my results and also traced the growth of the

Sardine at that place, showing that it reaches a length of 9 to 13 cm. in one year.

This year at Plymouth, in June, I obtained ripe female Pilchards, but no males.

However, 1 placed the ripe unfertilised ova in clean sea-water, and found that after
twenty-four hours the ova were alive and floating, the perivitelline space was
formed, and the eggs presented all the characteristic peculiarities I had previously
attributed to the ova of the Pilchard. I also at the same time obtained the same

eggs in process of development from the sea, by means of the tow-net. In July I
obtained the alevins of the Pilchard at the surface near the Eddy stone, a number

of specimens varying from -8 to 2-5 cm. in length. I hope to trace their further
growth and compare it with that of the Mediterranean Sardine. The ripe Pil-

chards at Plymouth are 23 to 25 cm. long, ripe adult Sardines in the Mediterranean

are only 15 to 18 cm.

                   7. Observations on the Larvce of Palinuras vulgaris.
                                  Bt/ J. T. Cunningham, M.A.

     On July 9 and IG of the present year I obtained a large number of the
Phyllosoma larvae of Palmurus vulgaris. Previously, in the summer of 1889,
the eggs of this species were hatched in the tanks of the Plymouth Laboratory of
the Marine Biological Association, and I preserved a number of the newly hatched
larvae. The latter are 3'1 mm. in length from the front of the cephalon to the end
of the abdomen. The largest of these taken in the sea are 7 mm. in length. I
find that the first maxilliped is not absent altogether at any of the stages I have
obtained ; it is represented in the newly hatched larvae as a small but distinct
conical process, and does not increase or decrease in any way up to the oldest stage
I have obtained. In the Phyllosoma of 7 mm. the antennae are more developed,
the fourth and fifth ambulator}^ appendages, present at hatching as minute processes,

have developed considerably, the fourth being already biramous. Richter's state-
ment therefore ('Zeitsch. f. wiss. Zoologie,' 1873) that the first maxilliped is
entirely absent in Palinurus phyllosoma in the earliest stages is not true in the
case of P. vulgaris. I find also that stages of Phyllosoma figured and described by

Claus (ibid. 1863) from 3'5 mm. to 21 mm. in length, are certainly larvae of

P. vulgaris, although this identification seems never to have been definitely
made before.

8. Distribution of Crystallogobius Nilssonii, Oill.

              By J. T. Cunningham, M.A.

I obtained this species in large numbers on July 9 of the present year when

trawling with a small beam-trawl about two miles north of the Eddystone, in

about twenty-seven fathoms of water. Day mentions only one specimen found in

British waters, namely, one taken by Thos. Edward in a rock-pool at Banff". This

specimen was a male. The species is distinguished by having only two rays in

the anterior dorsal fin in the male, tliis fin and the pelvic fins being rudimentary

in the female. The fish is quite transparent when alive, and scaleless ; the mature
male is about 4 cm. in length, the female smaller. There is a good paper on the

species by R. Collett, of Ohristiania, in ' Proc. Zool. Soc' for 1878. It is there

stated tliat the fish is fairly common in the Ohristiania Fjord, thirty specimens

Ahaving been taken there.  few specimens have been taken near Bergen, at

Christiausuud, and also in Bohuslan, in Sweden. I took in a single haul about

100 specimens, more than all those that had been taken in Norway and Sweden

since 1843, when the species was first discovered. All my specimens were adult

or nearly so, which agrees with Oollett's conclusion that the fish is an annual,

dying after breeding. Mr. E. W. L. Holt also took many specimens of the same

species in Ballinskelligs Bay, thirty fathoms, on August 21, 1890. The shrimp
trawl used by me was lined inside with mosquito netting, on purpose to retain

small animals. Probably the species is fairly abundant between twenty and thirty

fathoms, on smooth sandy ground, all along the British and Irish coasts.

           1. Facts regarding Prothalli and the Propagation of Ferns.
                            By E. J. Lowe, F.E.8., F.L.S.

    Occasionally in a batch of seedling ferns there will occur several plants of some
strangely marked variety identical in their characters and growing so closely to-
gether that it is difficult to separate them. I have long suspected these were pro-
duced on the same prothallus ; indeed this seemed evident in four instances of
--g88
EEPOiiT 1891.

remarkable seedling Atbyriums, yet the development was too far advanced for
absolute certainty. To examine this carefully, a number of Scolopendriums were
planted in the protballus state, and on the young fronds appearing, two were
noticed identical in character and unusual in form, which when examined were
found to have their origin in one well-developed protballus. AVitb a penknife it
was possible to divide the protballus so as to secure the two plants, which were

planted in a pan and have not since been disturbed.
     Prothalli were then planted from a pan of mixed muvicate and undulate Scolo-

pendriums, and these were divided before the formation of fronds into two equal
parts, in some examples the two plants resulting were alike, in others they differed

but showed their muricate and undulate origin.
     The next experiment was dividing the protballus into four equal parts. This

was done in January 18SS. Every division grew and spread in a more bush-like
manner than is the case with uudivided prothalli, but up to July 1890 there was
no sio-n of any frond. It appeared evident that the male and female organs of
generation were on separate divisions. To test this, in May 1890 another protballus
was planted in close proximity to one of these, in fact made to actually inter-
mingle, and in August fronds appeared. The other divisions except four were
similarly treate/1, and all have now produced fronds. The spores bad been sown

in August 1887, and divided on January 12, 1888, so that the protballus exhibited
has been in this condition four years. The usual time from protballus to frond

 being only a few mouths.
      In an interesting example of the lady fern (alluded to in the next paper), a pro-

 tballus produced three plants exactly alilce and having two kinds of fronds. It was
 from a mixture of eight varieties, and these show the parentage of six, and now and

 then seven. They have the lax pinni-e of nncum, the cruciate pinnae of Victoria,

 the projected pinnre of j)roJectui)i, the lunulate pinnules of Fri::ellia;, the cruciate
 pinnules oi cvucipinula, the truncate terminals of trimcatum, and occasionally the
 cresting of multijidum. This fern has reproduced six and occasionally seven

 characters. According to the doctrine of probability it is 720 to 1 against the

 production of six varieties on the same plant, and 5,040 against seven.

       Turning to other means of reproduction, experiments are required in order to

 ascertain why the bulbils that form on some frords do not always produce plants

 like the parent, and why it is possible to transfer the bulb-bearing character to
 other varieties. Scolopendrium densum often produces much more coarse and less

 divided ferns than itself. [De7istim and one of its coarse bulbils were exhibited.]
      The beautiful plumose shield fern known as plumosodivisolobum has produced

 two plants from its bulbils that are strikingly distinct from ths parent and each
  other ; one is densely imbricate and procumbent like the parent, whilst the other

  is as tiuely divided as Todea superba, and is erect in habit.
        Again, aposporous plants, that is those raised from the prothalli direct without

 the intermediate spore, also vary. [An aposporous plant of Clarissima of the
  Lady fern was described.] Even plants raised from bits of the stipes of plumose

  Scolopendriums produced a marginal belt.

      There are so many truths yet to learn with regard to ferns that it is desirable

  that some younger man should take up these inquiries.

2. On Ferns aiid their Multiple Parents. By E, J. Lowe, F.B.S., F.L.S.

     Colonel Jones and myself read a joint paper on abnormal Ferns at the Batb
meeting of the British Association, which is printed in full with illustrations in
the third volume of the ' Annals of Botany.' The present paper is a report on
further experiments, and of the surprising discoveries that have resulted.

     Since 1887 other hybrids have been obtained, and although these hybrids are
more or less sterile, a few plants (grandchildren of the original parents) have been
raised, and they differ so much from the parent that nearly all resemblance has

disappeared. What will be the characters of the great-grandchildren is now in

course of proof. It is very different in the case of the offspring of crossed varieties :
              TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.      689

they are copiously fertile, and when sown alone reproduce their rarietrJ form.
Not only have certain forms been imparted to other Ferns, but even variegation,
notably so in the Shield Fern and the Hart's-tongue. In the latter spores from a
normal but variegated form were sown thickly with a plumose (or crispum form)
and a branching form, and their offspring have become variegated. By sowing a
muriate and a plumose Hart's-tongue together, muriate plumose varieties have also

resulted.

     For illustrating multiple parentage the Hart's-tongue has been selected, as the
simple, strop-shaped fronds are best able to show the various departures from the

normal form.

la repeating the experiment of mixed spores the varieties iu each case have'

been limited to three or four, so that the resultant changes could be more narrowly

investigated. Distinct mixtures were sown in 1887, 1888, 1889, and 1890, and

the results in all the experiments established the fact that the antheridia of more
than one variety have assisted in the impregnation. The varieties had con-

spicuously distinct characters, and in the example of 1888 tlie spores were

gathered from a dwarf spiral form, a muricate or warty form, an undulate and a

ramose one ; more exactly speaking, the varieties were sjji'rale, andidatum, muri-
catuni, and keratoides. The parents were exhibited as well as three of their

children, the latter having the names of quadriparens, Daruiniana, and echinatum.

These unmistakably show on each plant the characters of the whole four parents.

In the hundreds of these seedlings, as might be expected, the majniity show only

the characters of two parents, in a less though considerable number the characters

of three, whilst a small number exhibit those of the four parents. The plants in

the 1889 experiments are from a muricate, a branched, and a cup-bearing form,

known as ^era/erew.s, the object being to obtain cups on a branching muricate

Fern, as this was a desideratum. There was no previous example of more than

one cup on a frond. In the seedlings a divided frond can be observed with cups

on each division, a tasselled form with a rosette in place of an actual cup, and in

another example a marginal row of small cups ; and all are muricate. It is worth

remarking that the seedlings from mixed spores never seem to produce any plants ·

that exactly resemble any one variety ; they are all combinations; in other words,
antherozoids from a number of ditierent antheridia are required for fertilisa-

tion. In sowing varieties of the Lady Fern I have raised the combination of five

and six. This is alluded to in my paper 'On Prothalli.' These plants that give

evidence of multiple parentage were obtained in the identical manner formulated

before they had any existence. Spores require to be sown thickly to enable the

prothalli to intermingle, otherwise they are only fertilised from the same prothallus.

If we take the reasoning of Sir John Herschel on the doctrine of probability, and

apply it to these experiments, the chances against the reasoning adopted being

incorrect are as great as that of the haphazard distribution of the stars. These
experiments regarding the changes in animal and vegetable life werecommenced

forty years ago. Bearing to some extent on this subject, experimenting on the

Mimulus, a yellow variety was crossed with a spotted one, and the seedlings were

spotted; later on, and further up the same stem, two blooms were this time
crossed with a yellow one, but the seedlings were still spotted. The efiect of the

first cross had become a part of the life-history of the plant ; in a second experi-
ment the same plant was simultaneously crossed with pollen from two other

Tarieties, and several of the seedlings are combinations of the three. It requires

dexterity in crossing the Mimulus, as the pistil is as sensitive as the sensitive

Mimosa. Natural changes are slow, but culturally we can accelerate that process

that continues age after age. The germ once changed, the new element is re-

tained, which becomes combined with others until the normal appearance is lost.

The illustration of the Hart's-tongue shows this alteration, helped on as it were by

artificial means that have accelerated the process, and these changes will continue

whilst the world lasts. Afl'ectionate respect causes tablets to be erected in

memory of the departed, but age obliterates this record. It is, however, far

different with the philosopher who has discovered great truths ; he has erected a

monument to himself ' more lasting than brass.' Time wears away the hardest

rock, but it will require the crumbling of this world to obliterate the truths that
have been taught by Charles Darwin.

3. The Ciliated Organs of the Leeches. Bij Professor Gilson.

    Tt is well known that the segmental organ of the Chetopods terminates in the
coelom iu the form of a funnel-shaped and ciliated structure.

In the leeches, on the contrary, though it is generally taught that there exists

a similar feature, our knowledge of it is imperfect.

     Se^'eral authors confess that they have not been able to detect in these worms
any relation between the segmental organ and certain ciliated bodies that have
been regarded by others as terminal funnels or nephridiostome.

    I have undertaken with one of my pupils. Dr. Bolsius, several researches in

order to resolve if possible that interesting question. I shall content myself with

an extremely short account of the results we arrived at up to the present as

regards the genus Nephelis.

Tlie ciliated organs of the Nephelis are not funnel- but cup-shaped bodies, with

a non-perforated bottom. The sides of the cup are composed of large bilobed
cells. The bottom, on the contrary, consists only of smaller and non-ciliated cells.

This cup lies enclosed in the cavity of a large vesicle, from the sides of which it

vibrates freely, being only suspended bj- a small number of large connective cells.
The vesicle is only a dilatation of one of these non-contractile blood-vessels that

represent, according to the view of Dr. Bourne, the greatly modified coelom of the

leeches. It lies at a certain distance from the segmental organ, and is ordinarily
separated from the same by muscles or connective cells.

     The result of these observations is that the ciliated organs of the Nephelis

deserve by no means the name of funnels, and that there is no anatomical

connection between them and the segmental gland.

   We can assert also that this gland does not open into the coelom, at least not

in certain genera of leeches, and especially the Nephelis, as it does in the well-
known case of the Chetopods.

The absence of connection between the ciliated bodies and the segmental

gland seems to be a result of the profound modification the coelom undergoes

in these remarkable forms of annelids.

The terminal or coelomic part of the segmental organ is separated from the

rest of the gland, and as this separation is not followed by immediate degeneration

--of the nephridiostome, it seems evident that the latter that is to say, the cup-
--shaped organ acquires at the same time a new significance and another

physiological function.

    As regards this new function we may propose two hypotheses which do

not exclude each other :

1. The cilia cause the blood to run through the non-contractile capillaries;

at least they help its motion through the coelomic system.

  --2. The organ is a place of proliferation of the blood-cells. In fact the

cup-shaped organ is ordinarily crowded with blood-corpuscles, the nuclei of which

Weare often remarkable for their chromatophile power.  detected also amongst

them several phases of karyocinesis.
    These results, I think, are noteworthy for anyone who is interested with

the position of the formation and evolution of the segmental organs and with the

kidney-theory. They will soon be published in full in the Louvain Review
' La Cellule.'

4. Some Points in the Early Development of Mus muscuhis and Mus decu-
     manus : the Relation of the Yolk Sac to the Decidua and the Placenta.
    By Arthur Robinson, M.D.

    1. At the seventh day the ovum consists of a large yolk sac and a small mass
of primitive epiblast which rests upon one pole of the ovum. The ovum is con-
TRANSACTlOiNS OK SECTION 1).  bifL

tained within a crypt in the distal wall of the uterine cavity, and the uterine
epithelium is disappearin^r from the walls of the crypt.

   A2. few hours later the primitive epiblast divides into formative epiblast and

trophoblast.

     3. During the latter part of the seventh day the trophoblast rapidly increases,
becomes closely attached to the decidua, and pushes the formative epiblast towards
the yolk sac, which becomes invaginated. The non-invaginated portions of the
yolk sac lie in direct contact with the decidua, in which numerous slit-shaped blood
spaces have appeared.

     4. In the early part of the eighth day the walls of the ovular crypt, which
sprang from the distal side of the uterine cavity, fuse with the proximal wall of
that canal, and thus the crypt is converted into a closed space, and the continuity
of the uterine canal is interrupted. The greater part of this space is occupied by
the ovum, but at the mesometrial and anti-mesometrial ends portions of the cavity
remain, and are transformed into maternal blood sinuses. The hlood in the meso-
metrial sinus bathes the proximal end of the trophoblast, and that in the anti-
mesometrial sinus bathes the distal end of the yolk sac. Further, by the
disappearance of the inner wall of the slit-shaped spaces at the sides of the yolk
sac the maternal blood is brought into direct relation with a large part of the
circumference of the yolk sac, and spaces which have in the meantime appeared in
the trophoblast also become filled with the same fluid.

     5. During the ninth day the coelom is formed, and the allantois, which is a solid
mass of mesoblast containing no diverticulum from the alimentary canal, grows
into the coelom, but it does not become attached to the trophoblast until the

eleventh day.
     6. Between the ninth and the seventeenth days the decidua reflexa gradually

separates from the distal wall of the uterus, and the continuity of the uterine canal
is re-established. The decidua reflexa is reduced to a thin membrane, and the

circulation within it ceases. When these changes are accomplished the distal part

of the vitelline cavity is obliterated by the apposition of its walls, but the proximal
portion remains ; and by means of diverticula, which project from it into the
placenta, the intimate relation of the yolk sac to the maternal blood is maintained
after the circulation in the decidua reflexa has terminated.

     7. The close relation of the yolk sac to the maternal blood suggests the idea
that the sac itself is an important agent in the early nutrition of the embryo, and

the peculiar relationship of the hypoblast to the placenta indicates the possibility
that the hypoblast cells play some special part in embryonic nutrition.

5. Ohservations upon the Development of the Spinal Cord in Mus musculus
     and Mus decumanus : the Formation of the tSepta and the Fissures.
    By Arthur Robinson, M.B.

    1. At the eleventh day the spinal cord is a hollow rod of nucleated protoplasm.
     2. Within a few hours the neuroblasts are differentiated.
    3. On the twelfth day the formation of the grey matter commences, and tha

rudiments of the white columns appear.
     4. The antero-lateral white columns consist of nerve fibrils derived from the

neuroblasts of the cord embedded in a spougioblastic reticulum.
     5. The posterior white columns are formed by the processes of the neuroblasts

of the spinal ganglia.
     6. The spongioblasts of the dorsal and ventral walls of the centred canal are

drawn out into two septa, an anterior and a posterior, which extend respectively to
the ventral and dorsal surfaces of the cord.

     7. The extension of the anterior septum is due to the formation of the anterior
commissures and the shrinking of the central canal.

     8. The extension of the posterior septum is due principally to the formation of
the posterior columns, but also to the formation of the posterior commissure and

the shrinking of the central canal.

                                                                                                               TT2
692 EEPORT-- 1891.

9. The anterior septum does not form a complete partition between the two

sides of the cord. It is traversed by the transverse fibres of the commissures.

10. The posterior septum is traversed by the transverse fibres of the posterior

commissure,    but it forms a complete                                                        partition between the  posterior white
                                                                                           '

columns.

11. There is no posterior Jissure, and the posterior septum is not a septum of

pia-inater, but of spongioblastic fibrils ; it is, therefore, essentially a portio7t of the

cord substance, not of its sheath.

12. The anterior fissure is formed in the usual manner, and contains a fold of

pia-mater.

6. On the Innervation of the I]pipodial Processes of some Nudihranchiate
    Mollusca. By Professor W. A. Heedsian, B.Sc, and J. A. Clubb.

In 1889 one of us (W. A. Herdman) read a paper at the Newcastle-on-Tyne

meeting of the British Association on the structure and functions of the cerata in

Nudibranchs, in which these dorso-lateral processes were regarded as being pro-

bably epipodial outgrowths. In other papers published since we have compared

the conditions of these structures in various genera of Nudibranchs, and have

tried to show that they are all modifications of simple lateral epipodial ridges.
     The question has, however, been raised lately by Pelseneer and others as to

whether the so-called epipodia of mollusca are all homologous structures, and one
of the subjects of controversy now is the origin of the nerve supply in various

forms, it being supposed that where the processes are innervated from the pleural

ganglia they are pallial in their nature, and where supplied from the pedal ganglia

they are to be regarded as outgrowths from the foot.

Cousequently, it seemed to us of importance to determine afresh the origin of

the nerves supplying the cerata in several diSerent types of Nudibranchiata,

especially as the results of former investigations, depending entirely, we believe,

Weupon minute dissection, are puzzling, and to some extent contradictory.                                            have

traced the nerves from the ganglia, by means of serial sections, in representatives

of the genera Folycera, Anctila, Tritonia, Dendronotus, and Eolis, with the follow-

ing results :

In Folycera quadrilineafa the cerebral and pleural ganglia are completely fused

to form a cerebro- pleural mass. The 'epipodial' nerves are found arising from

the ventral and posterior part of this mass {i.e. distinctly from the pleural ganglia),

and they run along the sides of the back to supply the ceratal ridges.

In Ancula cristata the pleural ganglia are fairly distinct from the cerebral. In

a specimen cut into about 500 sections, we find in the 100th section or so from the

anterior end six distiact ganglia (the cerebral, pleural, and pedal pairs) surrounding
Athe oesophagus.
                  few sections further back the cerebrals disappear, and then

the epipodial nerves are found arising from the dorsal edge of the pleural ganglia.
The nerves soon turn posteriorly, and then give off their first branches dorsally.

These branches enter the mesoderm of the body wall, and can then be traced back

through over a hundred sections to the first pair of cerata, which they enter. The
main nerve passes back to the remaining cerata.

In Tritonia and Dendronotus also the epipodial nerves arise from the pleural

ganglia ; but in Eolis (or Facelina) coronata we find that the main nerves to the

Wecerata arise distinctly from the pedal ganglia.                                             have also traced in the same

series of sections the ordinary pedal nerves to the foot proper, so there can be no

question as to the nature of the ganglia from which the nerves arise. The

epipodial nerves spring from about the middle of the pedal ganglion, rather on the

dorsal surface, and, after a short course, pass through the muscular layer of the
body wall and are distributed to the clumps of cerata.

    But in addition to these main epipodial nerves in Eolis, we find also a nerve
arising from the compound ganglionic mass, immediately ventral to the eye

(probably therefore from the pleural element), which goes to the front cerata.

This pleural nerve has its origin distinctly anterior to the origin of the main

epipodial nerves from the pedal ganglia.

                                                                                                                                      ,
TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.  693

   We arrive, then, at the curious result that the innervation of the ceratal

processes is not the same in all these Nudibranchs. In Poh/ccra, Ancula, Tritonia,
and Dendronotus the epipodial nerves arise from pleural ganglia, or from th»
ventral and posterior parts of cerebro-pleural masses; while in Eolis the chief
epipodial nerves are from the pedal ganglia, hut there are also smaller nerves from
the pleurals. lu the ordinary Rhipidoglossate gastropod, such as Trochus, the
epipodial ridges and processes are supplied, according to Pelseneer, by nerves
arising from the dorsal part of the elongated pedal ganglia. So, judging from the
nerve supply alone, it might be said that the cerata of Eolis are pedal in their
nature, and homologous with the epipodial processes of Trochus, while those of
Ancula and the rest are totally distinct structures of pallial ' origin. But these
dorso-lateral processes in the various Nudibranchs are so much alike in their
relations, and are connected by such series of gradations, that it is difficult to
believe that they are not all homologous, and the presence of the accessory
epipodial nerve in Eolis arising from the pleural ganglion suggests the possibility

of another explanation, viz., that these outgrowths, starting at first as pedal

structures innervated by nerves from the pedal ganglia, may have acquired,
possibly as the result of having moved further up the sides of the body, a supple-

mentary nerve supply from the adjacent integumentary nerves arising from the
pleural ganglia, and this supplementary supply, while remaining subordinary in

Eolis, may in the other types have gradually come to supplant the original
epipodial nerves, which are now no longer found in such forms as Polycera and
Ancula. This is at present only a suggestion, which, however, we hope to be able
either to disprove or support by the examination of the nerves of a number of

additional Nudibranchs.

  8. Exhibition of, and Eemarlcs ujwn, some Young Specimens o/ Echidna
                 acaleata. By Professor "W. N. Parkek, Ph.D.

    The specimens are from the collection of the late Professor "NV. K. Parker, who
received them from Dr. E. P. Ramsay, Curator of the Australian Museum,
Sydney. They are much curved towards the neutral side, the snout pointing
backwards, and the tail, in the older of the two stages, forwards. The younger

atage measures along the dorsal curve, from the end of the snout to the tip of the
tail, 12 cm., the greatest diameter of the body being 3 cm.; the corresponding
measurements of the older stage are respectively til 5 cm. and 6 cm. In the
latter the body is covered with short scattered bristles. In both stages the snout
is very similar in form to that of Ornithorliynchus, and is covered by a thick
horny layer, but in other respects the specialisation characteristic of Echidna is
already apparent. The gape is narrow, and extends only a short distance dowTi
the snout, and the manus, even in the younger stage, is already much larger and
stronger than the pes. The tail is short and conical. There is no caruncle, or
' egg-breaker,' in the snout, such as is seen in Ornithorhynchus.

   A few points in the structure of the fore part of the head in the older stage

were described. The mouth has the narrow and tubular form seen in the adult,
and the long tongue has a horn)' tip. The glands in relation with the mouth and
nose are very numerous. There is no trace of any teeth-rudiments, and in many
other respects the structure of the head shows extreme specialisation. Jacobson's
organ is large and highly developed ; a well marked * turbinal ' is present in it.

9. Experiments on Bespiration in Tadpoles of the Common Frog (liana

               temjporaria). By Professor W. N. Parker, Fh.D.

     After referring to the great power of adaptation to external conditions seen
amongst ampbibious larvte, the author described some experiments on frog tad-
poles, which, although not yet complete, show as follows :

   --1. Soon after the lungs become functional i.e. in tadpoles measuring more than

20 mm. in length the gills are no longer sufficient for purposes of respirjvtion,

and the animals die in a very short time if prevented from coming to the surface

to breathe.
     2. If tadpoles are prevented from using their lungs from an earlier stage

onwards the gills remain perfectly functional, and development proceeds as usual.

At metamorphosis the fore limbs are slow in becoming free, owing to the retention

of the operculum, that on the same side as the spiracle appearing hrst. Eventually
a slit-Hke spiracle is present on either side. In respiration the mouth is opened
and closed as in the tadpole. Specimens of branchiate frogs were exhibited in
which the tail had shrunk to less than half its original length.

] 0. On the Arrangement of the Living Fishes, as hased upon the Study of
  their Reproductive System. By Professor G. B. Howes, F.L.S., F.Z.S.

     On comparing the urino-genital organs of those Osteichthyes having a non-
abbreviated kidney with the same organs of the higher vertebrata and the

Elasmobranchs, the female genital duct and the kidney are seen to be inversely

proportionate in length. No feature more fully characterises the development

of the MiiUerian duct than the accompanying abbreviation of the kidney and the
disappearance of its head segment. The persistence of the last-named among
the Osteichthyes, and its possible retention of the renal function in rare cases,
taken in conjunction with the mode of development of the ovary duct in these

fishes, point to the conclusion that the latter is in no way homologous with the

Mullerian duct as ordinarily understood. Balfour's belief that the genital ducts
are homologous in both sexes of theTeleostei is supported by the facts of anatomy
and comparison of the reproductive system of the Ganoids with that of the

Teleosteans shows the two to he modifications of the same common type ; and
the absolute structural community of the parts in the males and females of the

 Sturiones, while further confirming Balfour's doctrine, is opposed to Jungersen's

implication that the subtle differences in the mode of development of the ducts in
 the opposite sexes of the Teleostei are indicative of their non-homology.

     The facts above alluded to justify us in regarding the genital ducts of the
Osteichthyes not only as homologous in the two sexes and primarily independent
 of the genital glands, but as distinct structures sui generis probably unrepresented

 in all other vertebrates.

      The Plagiostomi and Holocephali, in which vasa eflerentia are present and the
kidney becomes an accessory to reproduction in the male, may be grouped together
 into a Nephrorchidic Series, as distinguished from an Eufhorcliidic Series embracing
 the Osteichthyes (Ganoids and Teleosteans). Comparison of the pori-genitales in
 relation to the coalesced ureters of the Marsipobranchii with the corresponding

 parts of the females of those Teleostei destitute of genital ducts, especially in
 consideration of the facts concerning the development of the parts recorded by
 Scott, Liszt, and others, supports liatbke's conclusion that the ancestors of the

 first-named fishes must have possessed genital ducts. The Osteichthyes, although
 specialised in respect to many features of their organisation, have, together with
 the Marsipobranchs, retained the least modified type of urino-genital system

 known for living vertebrates. W. N. Parker's recent and important discovery,

 that while in Protopterus a MiiUerian duct is present vasa eflerentia are absent,
 the testicular products being discharged through a duct more nearly comparable
 to that of the bony fishes than to the genital ducts of any otlier vertebrates,
 suggests that the development of vasa eflerentia and the assumption of a genital
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.  695

function by the Wolffian duct, may have been effected subsequently to the
formation of the Miillerian oviduct. And further comparison of the Dipnoi with
the Elasmobranchii suggests that the former may have struck off from the

HolocephaUc branch of the latter before the differentiation of the ancestors of its
existing members.

     The following diagram expresses the relationship of the reproductive system of
fishes, as estimated upon the foregoing considerations :

            1, On the Artificial Production of BJiytJim in Plants.
                By Pkancis Darwin and Dokothea F. M. Pertz.

    The apparatus employed is a new form of klinostat designed by the Cambridge
Scientific Company. The plant to be experimented on is fixed to a spindle, which,
by means of a clockwork escapement, makes a sudden semi-revolution every half
hour. Thus the plant is subjected to a series of alternate and opposite influences
from light or gravitation as the case may be. To take the case of gravitation,
the plant will tend to curve upwards during the first half hour, and during the
second interval (when the horizontal spindle has made half a turn) it will tend to

curve geotropically in the opposite direction.

     Under these conditions it is found that a rhythmic state is induced which
closely resembles the periodicity in rate of growth which is set up in plants by
the alternation of day and night.

  A --remarkable result is obtained by stopping the clockwork that is to say, by

substituting a continuous for a changing stimulus. The plant continues to curve
with an acquired rhythm just as if the clockwork were still in action ; it has, ia
fact, learned and remembered the half-hourly period. This is precisely similar to

--certain natural rhythms for instance, to the ' sleep ' of flowers, which for a short

time continue to open and shut although kept constantly in the dark.

4. On the Occurrence of Dlastnse in Pollen.
  By Professor J. R. Green, M.A., B.Sc.

Though recent researches have led to the discovery of the various points of

interest connected with the morphology of the pollen grain and the pollen tube,

but little attention has been giveu to tbe details of its physiology. It is known

that the contents of the ripe grain, besides its protoplasm, include proteid and

carbohydrate bodies, tiie latter being in part starch, in part some form of sugar.

That these are reserve materials, intended to be used during the growth of the

pollen tube, seems to admit of no question. Indeed Van Tieghem has shown that

like other storehouses of reserve materials, the pollen grain of some plants contains

certainly one ferment or enzyme leading to the utilisation of these stores, the fer-

ment invertase which is capable of inverting cane sugar.

     Starch being of such frequent occurrence in pollen, attention was directed in
the experiments now briefly to be summarised to the possibility of there being also

present some form of diastase. The pollen taken for investiga'tion was that of the

Alily and that of the sunflower.  starch paste of about 1 per cent, strength was

the medium on which to test the action. In the first experiments the contents of

one ripe anther of a lily were mixed with 5 c.c. of this paste and exposed in a test

Atube for some hours to the temperature of about 20° C.   precisely similar

tube was boiled and set aside with the other to serve as a control. The diastatic

action slowly became evident, the unboiled starch paste passed through the several

stages of soluble starch and dextrin to sugar, the boiled one remaining unchanged.

Sunflower pollen gave a similar result.

Diastatic action being so established, it remained to see whether diastase itself

was present or whether the change was brought about by the pollen grain apart

from such a body. Diastase being readily soluble in water or in glycerine, an

Aattempt was made to prepare it from the pollen cells.    quantity of the pollen of

the sunflower was collected and ground up between two glass surfaces with some

dilute glycerine. When the pollen was completely broken up, as shown by

microscopical examination, it was left in contact with the glycerine for twelve

hours and then filtered free from debris.

   A similar experiment to the first was then arranged, the glycerine extract being

used instead of the pollen grains. In this case again, in the unboiled tube the

starch grada.ally disappeared by the usual stages, and there was simultaneously a

gradual and increasing appearance of sugar.
     The germination of the pollen grain thus, so far as its reserve of starch is con-

cerned, proceeds upon the same lines as the germination of the complex bodies
which we know as seeds.

     Further expevimeiits are in progress wbichwill deal with the fate of the nitro-
genous and fatty reserves, and further with the subsequent <?rowth of the pollen
tube and the way in which this latter structure is enabled to avail itself of the
nutritive materials among which it finds itself during its passage down the tissue

of the style.

          5. The Presence of a Dlastatic Ferment in Green Leaves.

                           By S. H. Vines, M.A., F.R.S.

     The author was led to investigate this point in consequence of the statement
recently made by Wortmann * that green leaves either do not contain any diastatic

ferment, or contain it in so minute a quantity that its physiological importance is

practically 7iil. Wortmann accounts for the well-known fact that starch is trans-

formed into sugar in green leaves by attributing the chemical change to the direct

action of the living protoplasm.

     The author's observations lead him to the quite contrary conclusion, viz., that

diastatic ferment is present (probably at all times) in green leaves ; and that its
physiological activity is so well marked that it appears superfluous to invoke, as

Wortmann does, the direct action of the protoplasm in the conversion of starch into

sugar in the living leaf.

     The authors method of experimentation consisted in mixing equal volumes of
leaf-extract and starch-solution ; and then, after the mixture had been allowed to
stand for some hours, volumetrically determining the amount of sugar present by

means of standard Fehling's solution.

The leaf-extract was prepared by triturating leaves with distilled water (100 c.c.

of water to 100 grammes of leaves), and then at once pressing the mass through a

Astrainer.  turbid, more or less acid extract is thus obtained. In the earlier ex-

periments a filtered clear extract was prepared ; but filtration was abandoned,

for it was found that a clear extract was much less active than a turbid extract.

Probably Wortmann's negative results are to be mainly ascribed to the use of

filtered extract.

The starch-solution was prepared by boiling starch with distilled water, in the

proportion of -o gramme of the former to 100 c.c. of the latter. The vessel was closed

with a plug of cotton-wool whilst the liquid was boiling, to prevent the access of
bacteria, and was allowed to cool for some hours; a certain amount of sediment

was deposited at the bottom of the vessel, but only the nearly clear supernatant

Hquid was used for experiment. The starch used appeared, on microscopical

examination, to consist of a mixture of wheat-starch with some potato-starch.

     The mixture of leaf-extract and starch-solution was usually allowed to stand all

Anight (about fourteen to sixteen hours). sample of the leaf-extract, diluted to the

corresponding strength, was in all cases analysed for sugar,andin most cases a larger
or smaller amount of sugar was found to be present in it. In some cases a control
experiment was made in which the leaf-extract had been boiled before being mixed
with the starch-solution ; in these cases the amount of sugar ultimately determined
did not exceed that found to be originally present in the leaf-extract, thus show-
ing that the boiled extract had not aflected the starch. In others, again, thymol or

boracic acid ('> percent.) was added to the mixture in order to prevent any possibility

of the interference of bacteria ; in these, the amount of sugar ultimately determined
was about the same as that in the simple mixture of leaf-extract and starch-solu-

tion alone, showing that the results obtained were not in any degree due to the
action of bacteria. The whole experiment was generally completed within twenty-

four hours, and the flasks containing the mixture were not artificially heated but
were kept on the laboratory table during the night whilst the action was pro-

ceeding.

In his experiments AVortmann made use of the colour-reactions, given with

iodine by solutions of starch and dextrin, for the purpose of determining the
amount of action, if any, of the leaf-extract on the starch-solution. The author,
however, discarded this method altogether ; for, according to Wortmann's own

                           ' Bot. Zeitnng, 1890.
--698 REPORT 1891,

showing, it is not one wliich can give satisfactory results ; lie preferred the more
laborious but more definite method of determining the sugar present by means of
standard Fehling's solution. This method involved careful preparation of the
liquids to be tested, so that they should be quite clear and colourless. At the close
of the period of digestion, the liquid was neutralised with lime-water, and then
boiled and filtered through 5 grammes of recently ignited animal charcoal until all
the colour was removed ; the charcoal was well washed, the washings being added
to the filtrate, which was then made up to standard volume, when it was ready for
the determination of sugar. The liquids belonging to each experiment were all
simultaneously treated in precisely the same manner. The determination of sugar

was effected by allowing the liquid to drop from a graduated burette into a fixed

quantity of boiling standard Fehling's solution, continuing the boiling for three

minutes. The purity and the uniform strength of the Fehling's solution were
carefully attended to. The amount of the reducing substance was, in all cases,

calculated as dextrose.

In order to determine whether or not the substance in the liquids which reduced

Fehling's solution really was sugar, a quantity of leaf-extract was made, filtered, and
Adialysed : the resulting clear solution evaporated to dryness.
                                                                 residue was thus

obtained which smelt strongly of sugar, and which dissolved readily in water ; the

strong watery solution of the substance gave a well-marked reaction with sodium

acetate and phenyl-hydrazine hydrochloride, a reddish-yellow precipitate being
formed on warming, consisting of tufts of large acicular crystals. The solution did
not, however, have any rotatory effect on polarised light when examined in the
polarimeter. There can be no doubt that the substance is a sugar, and presumably

it should be maltose ; but it does not resemble maltose in being strongly dextro-
rotatory. In order to determine whether or not it is capable of undergoing
alcoholic fermentation, some yeast (10 c.c.) was added to some of the pure sugar-
solution (100 c.c.) and the mixture was kept for twenty-six hours in an mcubator

at about 36° C. It appeared to be fermenting, and when distilled, a liquid came
over of sp. gr. ·997, which would correspond to about 2 per cent, of alcohol : this
liquid also gave the iodoform reaction. The sugar in question appears, therefore,

to be fermentable.

   A further peculiarity, which may be of some importance, is that the crystals of

the phenyl-compound produced in the phenyl-hydrazine hydrochloride test are
soluble in absolute alcohol, giving an orange-coloured solution, but they are almost
insoluble in ether ; whereas the crystals formed (phenylglucosazone) when dextrose
is similarly treated are readily soluble in both alcohol and ether, giving a yellow

solution.

     The sample of the sugar above described was obtained from a mixture of
800 c.c. of leaf-extract (prepared from 750 grammes fresh lawn-mowings con-
sisting chiefly of grass, with some clover and Achillea) with 900 c.c. starch-
solution. The sugar obtained included that which was originally present in the
leaf-extract, as well as what was formed from the added starch.

     The following will serve as an example of the experiments, and of the results

--obtained : Six flasks were prepared, and were allowed to stand overnight for

14i hours : the leaf-e.xtract was prepared from fresh lawn-mowings.

     The sugar was estimated as fractions of grammes of dextrose in 100 c.c. of
liquid. Similar results were obtained with leaf-extracts of the Marrow {Ciicwbita
ovifera), the Sunflower (Helianthus annuus), and the Dwarf Runner {Fhaseolus
vulgaris) ; also with those of the Lime (Tilia europcea) and of the Dwarf Runner
when a 1 per cent, solution of dextrin was used.

     In the two following cases results were obtained which appear to be at
variance with the preceding ; in both of them the percentage of sugar present in
the mixture of leaf-extract and distilled water was greater than that in the mixture
of leaf-extract and starch-solution.

     It is probable that in these cases the starch-solution added to the leaf-extract
(No. 1 in both) was not in the least degree attacked. The peculiarity to be
accounted for is the large amount of sugar present in the diluted leaf-extract
(No. 2 in both). It is clear, in the case of the carrot, that the amount of sugar
originally present in the leaf-extract (see Nos. 4 and 5) was about '08 per cent.
the excess of sugar in No. 2 (about '045 per cent.) appears to be due to the action
of the diastatic ferment vpon stm-ch contained normally/ in the leaf-extract. The
presence of added starch-solution (Carrot, No. 1) appears to have actually impeded
the action of the ferment upon the leaf-starch already present.

     The experiments were carried on from the end of June to the middle of

August, 1891.
     The author is aware that various points connected with this research require

more complete investigation; he is, however, unable to continue the work at
present, but hopes to return to it next year. The foregoing facts will, he
believes, suffice to prove that Wortmann's conclusion as to the absence of diastatic
ferment from green leaves, or its unimportance, is based upon insufficient evidence.
It may be objected that the amount of ferment-action indicated in the foregoing
experimental results is very small, but much weight cannot be attached to this

objection. What the results really indicate is that the amount of diastatic

ferment which can, at any one time, be extracted from a leaf is small ; but doubt-
less the secretion of the ferment goes on continuouslj-, so that the total ferment-

--action in, say, the course of a warm night would be very considerable quite

sufficiently so to account for the conversion of starch into sugar which actually

occurs, without the direct intervention of the living protoplasm.

    As a conclusive piece of evidence in support of his view, Wortmann cites an

experiment which shows that if a leaf be kept in an atmosphere of COo, the starch
which it contains is not converted into sugar ; and he infers that this is due to an
arrest of the action of the protoplasm upon the starch in consequence of the

absence of free oxygen. It appears to the author that this inference is not the
true one to be drawn from the fact as stated : a more satisfactory explanation would
seem to be that, in the absence of free oxygen, the secretion of diastatic ferment by
the protoplasm is arrested, and that it is on this account that the conversion of

starch into sugar does not proceed.
     The author desires to acknowledge the valuable help which he has received in

this work from Mr. Manley, Assistant in the Chemical Laboratory of Magdalen

College, Oxford.

        6. On the Nuclei of the Hymenomycetes. By Hakold "Wagee.

     In this paper an account is given of some observations upon the structure and
changes v^hicli take place in the nuclei of the basidia of Agaricus {Stropharia)
stercorarius. Rosenvinge states that the young basidia of the various species of
Hymenomycetes which he has examined never contain more than one nucleus.

     In A. stercorarius and other species of Agarici which I have examined, I have
found in the very young basidia txco nuclei ; these probably pass into the basidia
from the hyphre. At this early stage each basidium contains a small quantity of
protoplasm and one" or more vacuoles.

     The two nuclei fuse together to form a single large nucleus which is placed near
the centre of the basidium. The basidium then becomes filled with a dense
protoplasm containing no vacuoles.

     The structure of the nucleus is similar to that of the higher plants ; it consists
of a nuclear membrane enclosing a dense nucleolus and a thread-like network.
The nucleolus stains very deeply, the threads slightly.

     As the basidium increases in size so also does the nucleus. The latter places
itself near the apex. of the basidium. The nuclei vary in size, generally speaking
they are from 3'5 to 4 fi.in diameter, but some of them have a diameter of 4'5 to
5 p.. The nucleoli are about 1 '9 to 2 ^ in diameter.

    The nucleus now divides, first of all into two and then into four. The division,
which is an indirect one, takes place before the appearance of the sterigmata.

Previous to the division, the nucleus elongates slightly towards the apex ; its
outline becomes somewhat irregular ; the thread-like network accumulates at the
apex, and the nucleolus takes up its position at the opposite end of the nucleus.
The nucleolus gradually disappears, and at the same time a group of deeply stained
short threads or granules appears in place of the thread-like network at the upper
end of the nucleus.

     At this stage the nuclear membrane seems to have disappeared, but a some-
what irregular and somewhat clear s])ace surrounds both the nucleolus and the
deeply stained chromatic elements. These latter separate into two groups which
pass to either side of the basidium. In this way two new nuclei are formed
which are small at first, but gradually increase in .size, and have a structure similar
to that of the parent nucleus. The two new nucleoli appear to be formed from
the chromatic elements. The two nuclei then elongate and divide in the same
manner as the primary nucleus. The four nuclei thus formed have a structure
similar to the parent nucleus, but are much smaller.

      Previous to the development of the sterigmata, they pass to the lower end of
the basidium, where they come into such close contact with each other as to
appear as if fused together ; it is not quite certain whether fusion does or does not
take place in any case they undergo certain changes resulting in the accumulation

                                                          ;

of a more or less irregular mass of chromatin on their walls. This chromatin
presents the appearance of a very loose network surrounding the four nucleoli.

     While these changes are taking place, the four sterigmata appear at the apex
of the basidium. At the apex of each sterigm a a spore is produced protoplasm

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

from the basidium passes into the spores.

     The nuclei at the base of the basidium now separate and pass to the apex

·each nucleus takes up a position at the base of one of the sterigmata, and this
position they retain for some time. The protoplasm of the basidium becomes
more and more vacuolated as it decreases in amount. Finally, nearly the whole
of it passes into the spores.

     The outline of each nucleus gradually disappears ; the nucleolus becomes

--smaller small enough to pass without difficulty into the spore, but whether such

a passage takes place or not I have not been able to determine. The spores
certainly do not contain a nucleus until a very late stage, e.g. after the formation
of the thick spore membrane.

     When the spores are ripe they are seen to contain two nuclei, probably derived
from the single nucleus which passes into them in some way or other from the

basidium.

7. New Form of Apjpendicularian ' Haus.' Bij Geo. Swainsom, F.L.8.

    ' Hans ' was the name given by the Russian naturalist, Von Mertens, to the
large transparent enveloi^e or sac so rapidly formed by the Appendicularia, Oiko^
pleiira cophocerca, as a secretion from the ectoderm which he met with ia the arctic

seas in 1829. He asserted that this envelope was an organ of respiration, consist-

ino' of a regular network of vessels, in which the circulation of blood-corpuscles
was evident. This was greatly doubted by Professor Huxley as being, if true,
* \inique and startling,' and constant search was made for other specimens but with-

out success until 1858, when Professor Allman captured another and very different
form of 'Haus' in the Clyde.* Since then Von Mertens' species has been seen

and described by Fol.-                                        ,,,

     There was no doubt about the tunicate body of the Appendicularia with its
' stigmata,' &c. ; but the gelatinous envelope or sac appeared to have two whips oi-

fan-like organs. Professor llerdman on seeing my drawing at once suggested)

these were probably the optical expression of the tail of the Appendicularia tui-ned

upon itself.                                                                                                            . .,

This diaphanous sac was shaped very like a bishop's mitre and into it the salt

water was conr^tantly being driven by the lashing whips, and I saw an oval body

ejected from it, which I now believe to have been a fertilised ovum.

Fortunately on the third of this present August I was successful in capturing a

second specimen, brought along by a strong tidal current from the IVorth-west

Atlantic. On examining it in a watch-glass I found Dr. Herdman was quite
right, for the tail of the Appendicularia formed the upper side of the mouth of the

sac, while the other side of the opening was made of the thickened and folded edge

of the gelatinous membrane which was connected with and secreted by the posterior

part of the Appendicularia.

The constant lashing of the tail was responded to by a co-ordinate muscular

action in this thickened membrane, and the whole gelatinous mass was carried

about through the surrounding water by these continuous vibrations. Although

mconstructed for a similar purpose, the size and form of the ' Haus ' my specimens

differed very much from both Allman's and Von Mertens', being about half the

size and possessing neither the ' double fans ' of  Allman's  nor                                                  the  'horns                                   of  Von.

702 REPORT-- 1891.

Like Professor Allman I must deny the possession of blood-vessels, or that the

* Haus                                   has  any respiratory function,  although                                                                                                                           I  must  admit      there  were  some
                                      '

grounds for Von Mertens' idea in the very perceptible systole and diastole seen in

the thickened laminae of the horns of the mitre, in apparent response to the vibra-

tion of the tail. By this means the water contained in the envelope was con-

stantly renewed, and the ova therein protected duly oxygenised.

     I feel quite certain that this is the main function of this ' Haus,' and that Dr.

Allman was correct in calling it a nidamental covering for the ova, for in the en-'

velopes of both my specimens were ova to be seen, while in those of Dr. Allman

there were young Appendicularise.

      This sac is probably a primitive test, resembling the transparent test of Clarelina,

and this supports the idea of Professor Herdman that the Appendicularise were an

early offshoot from the ancestral chordate form. In the Appendicularia there is
no separate peribranchial cavity within which the ova can be fertilised and

developed.

      This envelope is only loosely attached to the animal's body, for in the struggle

of the creature to get away from the strong light thrown upon it by the micro-
scope it made a most vigorous contraction, and thereby jerked itself free from the
membrane, leaving it behind in a limp, collapsed condition, without apparent

vitality of any kind.

8. On the Gustomary Methods of Describing the Gills of Fishes.
            By Professor G. B. Howes, F.L.8., F.Z.8.

The gills of Marsipobranchs and Plagiostomes are not unfrequently enumerated

in relation to the opposite walls of the visceral sacs which give origin to them,

while those of the higher fishes are enumerated in relation to the opposite faces of

the septa which bear them. The confusion arising out of this is well known to

teachers, and is in itself sufficient to justify the introduction of a revised nomen-

clature for the parts concerned. The facts of development show (i.) (on the

assumption that the mandibular or mouth cavity is serially homologous with a

pair of post oval visceral clefts) that each gill lies in front of its corresponding

skeletal arch (ii.) that the saccular type of gill met with in the Marsipobranchs
                                                             ;

and Plagiostomes is that from which the pectinate one of the higher gnathosto-

matous tishes has been derived, and (iii.) that a mandibular gill has no existence

in living fishes. Gills of the Marsipobranch-Plagiostome type may be conveniently

described for general anatomical purposes as Ci/atobrancJiia;, and those of the

higher Teleosteoid type as FectinobrancMm                                                                                                                                                                   while the parts of  the individual gills
                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

should be in both and in all cases enumerated in relation to the visceral pouches

from which they arise. Thus, the spiracular gill of Elasmobranchs (often termed

the mandibular pseudobranch) should be described as the hyoid hemibranch, and

the opercular gill of the higher fishes (often termed the hyoid pseudobranch) as

the first branchial hemibranch.

The well-known series of buccal filaments met with in certain Chelonia appear

to have the fundamental relationships of gill folios, and in view of the discovery

by Dohrn, Piatt, and others that the buccal sac would appear, from its mode of

development in the Teleostei, to be the morphological equivalent of a pair of gill

pouches, the possibility that these filaments may (at any rate for the most part)

represent mandibular gills of a reversional character must not be overlooked.

      --Pbesident of the Section E. G. Eavenstein, F.R.G.S., F.S.S.

                            THURSDAY, AUGUST 20.

     The President delivered the following Address :

                                       The Field of OeograpJiy.
It hehoves every man from time to time to survey the field of his lahours, and to
render an account unto himself of the work he has accomplished, and of the tasks
which still await him, in order that he may perceive whether the means employed
hitherto are commensurate with the magnitude of his undertaking, and likely to
lead up to the desired results.

     Such a survey of the 'Field of Geography' I propose to make the subject of

my address to-day. You are aware that this field is a large one, that its boundaries

are defined no more precisely than are the boundaries of other fields of human
research, and that the feUow-labourers who join us in its cultivation are not always
agreed as to the tasks that are pecidiarly their own, or as to the methods in accord-
ance with which their work should be carried on. By some of our neighbours we
have not infrequently been accused of encroachments, and of overstepping our

legitimate boundaries in order to invade adjoining fields already in the occupa-

tion of others, who are not only willing to cultivate them, but even claim to be
better qualified than we are. There is undoubtedly some truth in this reproach,
for, although there have been, and perhaps still are, geographers who would limit
their task to a mere description of the earth's surface, there are others, to judge
them by their performances, to whom earth and universe, geography and cosmo-
graphy, are synonymous terms.

     If, as a lexicographer, I were merely called upon to define the literal meaning
of the word ' geography,' I should content myself by saying that it meant a
'description of the earth.' This, however, is merely the translation of a name
given to our department of knowledge in an age when all natural science was
descriptive, and scientific inquirers were still content to collect facts, without
attempting to reduce them to a system. The ancient name, however, has been
retained, notwithstanding that our conception of the duties of the geographer has
undergone a notable change. The German word ' Erdkunde,' although too com-
prehensive, would perhaps be preferable, but could be rendered only by the word
'geology,' a term already appropriated to quite a distinct department of science,

which has much in common with geography, and may even be described as its

offspring, but is most certainly not identical with it.
     Very varied have been the views as to what geography should embrace. Whilst

Ptolemy would confine the duties of the geographer to the production of a correct
map of the earth's sm-face, others fell into the opposite extreme, and were
unable to resist the temptation of embellishing their ' systems of geography ' with
historical excursions, and with information of the most varied kind, only remotely,
if at all, connected with their subject. But whilst the geographer should guard,
on the one hand, against being drawn away from his legitimate task, he should not,
--704 EEPOET 1891.

on tlie other, allow himself to be intimidated by those who, ou the pretence of
creating a geographical ' science,' would frighten him awaj' from fields of research
which his training enables him to cultivate to greater advantage than can be done

by representatives of other departments of knowledge.
    But whatever changes may have taken place respecting the aims of the

geographer, it is very generally acknowledged that the portraiture of the earth's

surface in the shape of a map lies within his proper and immediate domain. And

there can be no doubt that a map possesses unique facilities for recording the

fundamental facts of geographical knowledge, and that with a clearness and per-

spicuity not attainable by any other method. You will not, therefore, think it

myespecially as own labours have in a large measure been devoted to that depart-

Anment of geographical work.   inspection of the interesting collection of maps of

aU ages which I am able to place before you will serve to illustrate what I am

about to say on this subject.

You may take it for granted that naaps have existed from the very earliest

Wetimes.  can hardly conceive of Joshua dividing the Promised Land among the

twelve tribes, and minutely describing their respective boundaries, without the

assistance of a map. The surveyors and land-measurers of the civilised states of

antiquity undoubtedly produced cadastral and engineering plans, which answered

every practical requirement, notwithstanding that their instruments were of the

simplest. This is proved by a plan of Home, the only document of the kind which

has survived, at least in fragments, to the present time. It is engraved on slabs af

marble on a scale of 1 :300, and was originally fixed against a wall of the Roman

Town Hall, so that it might be conveniently consulted by the citizens.
    Of the existence of earlier maps of the world or even of provinces, we possess

only a fragmentary knowledge. Anaximander of Miletus (610-546 B.C.) is credited

among the Greeks with having produced the first map. His countryman Hecataeus

the Elder, who had seen many lands, and of whom Herodotus borrowed the terse

saying that Egypt was the gilt of the Nile, about 500 years before Christ, exhibited
to his fellow-citizens a brazen tablet upon which was engraved ' a map of the entire
circuit of the world, with all its seas and rivers,' and pointed out to them the vast

extent of the Empire of Darius, with whom they were about to engage in hostilities.

But his warning proved in vain, and their disregard of the teachings of geography

had, as usual, to be dearly paid for.

     That maps grew popular at an early age is proved by Aristophanes, who, in
his comedy of ' The Clouds,' 423 B.C., has a map of the world brought upon the
stage by a disciple of the Sophists, who points out upon it the position of Athens

and of other places familiar to the audience.

   A real advance in cartography was made when Dicrearchus of Messana (390-

290 B.C.) introduced the parallel of Rhodes, as a separator between the northera

and the southern habitable worlds. This ' diaphragm ' was intersected at right
angles by parallel lines representing meridians. This system of graduating a map

was accepted by Eratosthenes (276-196 B.C.), and appears to have kept its hold

upon the more scientific cartographers up to the time of Marinus of Tyre, the

immediate predecessor of Ptolemy. AVhether the map of the Roman Empire,

which Agrippa, the son-in-law of Augustus, caused to be placed under a portico,

and which was based upon itinerary surveys begun forty-four years before Christy

was furnished with parallels and meridian we do not know. It probably resembled
in appearance some of our medifeval maps, like that of Richard of Haldingham,

still preserved in the cathedral of Hereford. Widely different from it were the road-

maps or ' Itineraria picta ' of the Romans, of which ' Peutinger's Table ' is a well-

known example of a late date.
    Such, then, were the maps which existed when Ptolemy of Alexandria

appeared upon the field, and introduced reforms into the methods of representing
the earth's surface which fully entitled him to the foremost place among ancient

cartographers, and which inspired his successors when the study of science revived

in the fifteenth century.

    Ptolemy, like all great reformers, stood upon the shoulders of the men who had

  preceded bim, for before a map like bis could be produced mucb preliminary work
  'had been accomplisbed. Parmenides of Elea (460 b.c.) bad demonstrated that
  our eartb was a globe, and Eratosthenes (276-196 B.C.) bad approximately deter-
  mmed its size. Hipparcbus (190-120), the greatest astronomer of antiquity, the
  discoverer of the precession of the equinoxes, and the author of a catalogue of stars,
  had transferred to our earth the auxiliary lines drawn by biui across the heavens.
  He had taught cartographers to lay down places according to their latitude and
  longitude, and how to project a sphere upon a plane. It is to bim we are indebted
  for the stereograpbic and orthographic projections of the sphere. Ptolemy himself

  invented the tangential conical projection.

       The gnomon or sun-dial, an instrument known to the Chinese 600 years before
  Christ, had long been used for the determination of latitudes, and the results were
 relatively correct, although uniformly subject to an error of 16 minutes, which
 was due to the observers taking the altitude of the upper limb of the sun,
 when measuring the shadow case by their dial, instead" of that of the sun's

 -centre.

       It was known, likewise, that differences of longitude could be determined by
  the simultaneous observation of eclipses of the sun or moon, or of occultations of
 stars, and Hipparcbus actually calculated Ephemerides for six years in advance to

 focilitate computations. Ptolemy himself suggested the use of lunar distances.
 But so imperfect were the astrolabes and other instruments used by the ancient
 astronomers, and especially their time-keepers, that precise results were quite out
  of the question.

       Ptolemy, in fact, contented himself with accepting eight latitudes determined
 by actual observation, of which four were in Egypt, whilst of the three longitudes

 known to bim be only utilised one in the construction of his map. Unfortunately,

 the one selected proved the least accurate, being erroneous to the extent of 32 per
 cent., whilst the error of the two which he rejected did not exceed 13 per cent.*
 This want of judgment, pardonable, no doubt, under the circumstances, vitiated
 Ptolemy's delineation of the Mediterranean to a most deplorable extent, far more

so than did his assumption that a degree only measured live hundred stades, when

 in reality it measures six hundred. For whilst the breadth of his Mediterranean,
 being dependent upon the relatively correct latitudes of Alexandria, Rhodes,
 Rome, and Massilia, fairly approximates the truth, its length is exaggerated to the
·extent of nearly 50 per cent., measuring 62° instead of 41° 40'. This capital error
 of Ptolemy is due therefore to the unfortunate acceptance of an incorrect longitude,

quite as much as to an exaggeration of itinerary distances. It is probable that
 Ptolemy would have presented us with a fairer likeness of our great inland sea
bad he rejected observed latitudes and longitudes altogether and trusted exclusively

 to his itineraries and to such bearings as the marmers of the period could have
supplied bim with.

     No copy of Ptolemy's original set of maps has reached us, for the maps drawn

by Agatbodaemon in the fifth century are, under the most favourable circumstances,
merely reductions of Ptolemy's originals, or they are compiled from Ptolemy's
' Geography,' which, apart from a few explanatory chapters, consists almost wholly
of lists of places, with their latitudes and longitudes.

    An examination of Ptolemy's maps shows very clearly that they were almost

wholly compiled from itineraries, the greater number of which their author borrowed
from his predecessor Marinus. It shows, too, that Ptolemy's critical acumen as a
·compiler cannot be rated very high, and that he failed to utilise much information
ol a geographical nature which was available in his day. His great merit consisted
in having taught cartographers to construct their maps according to a scientific

method. This lesson, however, they were slow to learii, an! centuries elapsed

before they once more advanced along: the only correct path which Ptoh my had

been the tirst to tread.

    During the ' Dark Ages ' which followed the disruemberment of the Roman
Empire there was no lack of maps, but they were utterly worthless from a
scientific point of view. The achievements of the ancients were ignored, and the

priucipal aim of the map-makers of the period appears to have been to reconcile
their handiwork with the orthodox interpretation of the Holy Scriptures. Hence
those numerous ' wheel maps,' upon which Jerusalem is made to represent the

hub, whilst the western half of the disk is assigned to Europe and Africa, and the

eastern to Asia.

myAs it is not                           intention to introduce you to the archaeological curiosities of

an uncritical age, but to give you some idea of the progress of cartography, I at

once pass on to the Arabs.

The Arabs were great as travellers, greater still as astronomers, but con-

temptible as cartographers. Their astronomers, fully possessed of the knowledge

of Ptolemy, discovered the error of the gnomon, they improved the instruments

which they had inherited from the ancients, and carefully fixed the latitudes of

quite a number of places. Zarkala, the Director of the Observatory of Toledo, even

attempted to determine the diflFerence of longitude between that place and

Bagdad                                   and if his result  diff'ered to  the extent of three degrees from  the  truth,
                                      ;

it nevertheless proved a great advance upon Ptolemy, whose map exhibits an error

amounting to eighteen degrees. Had there existed a scientific cartographer among

the Arabs, he would have been able, with the aid of these observations and of the

estimates of distances made by careful obser\trs like Abul Hasan, to efi'ect most

material corrections in tlie map of the known world. If Edrisi's map (1154) is

better than that of others of liis Arab contemporaries, this is simply due to his-

residence at Palermo, where he was able to avail liiasflf of the knowledge of the

Italians.

Quite a new epoch in the history of Cartography begins with the introduction

of the magnetic needle into Europe. Hitherto the seaman had governed his course

by the observation of the heavens ; thenceforth an instrument was placed in his

hands which made him independent of the state of the sky. The property of the

magnet or ' loadstone ' to point to the north first became known in the eleventh

century, and in the time of Alexander Neckam fl 185) it was already poised upon a

pivot. It was, however, only after Flavio Gioja of Amalfi (1302) had attached to

it a compass-card, exhibiting the direction of the winds, that it became of such
immediate importance to the marmer. It is only natural that the Italians, who

were the foremost seamen of that age, should have been the first to avail themselves

of this new help to navigation. At quite an early date, as early probably as the

twelfth century, they made use of it for their maritime surveys, and in course of

time they produced a series of charts upon which the coasts frequented by them, from

the recesses of the Black Sea to the mouth of the Rhine, are delineated for the first

time with surprising fidelity to nature. The appearance of these so-called compass-

charts, with gaily coloured roses of the winds and a bewildering number of rhumb-

Alines, is quite unmistakable.                              little consideration will show you that if the varia-

tion of the compass had been taken into account in the construction of these charts,

tbey would actually have developed into a picture of the world on Mercator's projec-

tion. But to deny them all scientific value, because they do not fulfil this condition, is

going too far. As correct delineations of the contours of the land they were a great

advance upon Ptolemy's maps, and it redounds little to the credit of the 'learned '

geographers of a later tinie that they rejected the information so laboriously

collected and skilfully combined by the chart makers, and returned to the defor-

mities of Ptolemy. The adjustment of these charts to positions ascertained by

Anastronomical observations could have been easily effected.              inspection of

my diagrams will prove this to you. The delineation of Italy, on the so-calledf

Catalan map, is surprisingly correct; whilst Gastaldo, whose map of Italy is nearly

                                                                                                                 I

two hundred years later, had not yet been able to emancipate himself from the

overpowering authority of Ptolemy. And in this he did not sin alone,for Italian and
other cartographers of a much later time still clung pertinaciously to the same

error.

     There were others, however, who recognised the value of these charts, and
embodied them in maps of the entire world. Among such were Marino Sanute
(1320) and Fra Mauro (1453), both of whom made their maps the repository of
much information gathered from the Arabs or from their own countrymen who
had seen foreign parts. Fra Mauro, more especially, has transmitted to us a

picture of Abyssinia marvellously correct in its details, though grossly exaggerated

in its dimensions.

     Another step in the right direction was taken when the cartographers and
pilots of Portugal and Spain returned to the crude projection of Dicaeareh,
Eratosthenes, and Marinus, which enabled them to lay down places according to
latitude and longitude upon their ' plane charts.'

     Gerniany, debarred from taking a share in the great maritime discoveries of the
age, indirectly contributed to their success by improvements in mathematical

geography and the introduction of superior instruments. The navigators of the
early middle ages still made use of an astrolabe when they desired to determine a
latitude, but this instrument, which in the hands of an expert observer furnished
excellent results on land, was of little use to a pilot stationed on the unsteady deck
of a vessel. Regiomontanus consequently conferred an immense service upon the
mariners of his time when, in 1471, he adapted to their use an instrument
already known to the ordinary surveyors. It was this cross staff which Martin
Behaim introduced into the Portuguese navy, and which quickly made its way
among the navigators of all countries. Most observations at sea were made with
this simple instrument, variously modified in the course of ages,-until it was super-
seded by Hadley's sextant. In the hand.s of the more skilful navigators of the
seventeenth century, such as Baffin, James, and Tasman, the results obtained vrith
the cross-staff were correct within two or three minutes.

     Far greater difficulties were experienced in the observations of longitudes.
Lunar eclipses were most generally made use of, but neither the Ephemerides of.

Reo^iomontanus, for the years 1474 to 1506, which Columhus carried with him on
his voyages, nor those of Peter Apianus, for 15;21-70, were sufficiently accurate to
admit of satisfactory results, even though the actual observation left nothing to be
desired. Errors of 30 degrees in longitude were by no means rare, and it was only
when Kepler had published his ' Eudolphine Tables ' (1626), which according to
Lalande formed the basis of all astronomical calculations during a century, that
more exact results were obtained. The suggestion to determine longitude by
means of lunar distances or occultations of stars bore no fruit at that time, as the
knowledge of the complicated motion of the moon was still very imperfect. Still
less was known about the movements of the satellites of Jupiter which Galileo
had first espied in IGIO when looking at that planet through his telescope. They
became available only after tables of their revolutions and eclipses had been
published by Cassini in 1668.

    Another suggestion for the determination of longitude was made by Gemma

Frisius in 1530, namely, that a clock or timekeeper should be employed for the
purpose. One of Huygens's pendulum clocks was actuallj' carried by Holmes to
 the Gulf of Guinea, but the results obtained were far from encouraging.

     The difficulties which still attended the determination of longitude in the six-
teenth centui-y are conspicuously illustrated by the abortive attempts of a Congress
of Spanish and Portuguese navigators who met at Badajoz and Yelves in 1524
for the purpose of laying down the boundary line, which Pope Alexander VI. had
drawn at a distance of 370 Spanish leagues to the west of Cape Verde Islands,
to separate the dominions of Spain from those of Portugal. Not being able to
agree either as to the length of a degree, nor even as to that of a league, they sepa-

rated without settling the question placed before them.
      So uncertain were the results of observations for longitude made during the

 sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, that it was thought advisable to trust to the
 results of dead-reckoning rather than to those of celestial observations. But the
 method of dead-reckoning is available only when we have a knowledge of the size
 of the earth, and this knowledge was still very imperfect, notwithstanding the
 renewed measurement of an arc of the meridian by Snellius, the Dutch mathema-
 tician (1615). This measurement, however, is remarkable on account of its having
 for the first time applied the exact method of triangulation to a survey.

     The problem of measuring the ship's way had been attempted by the Romans,
 who dragged paddle-wheels behind their ships, the revolutions of which enabled
 them to estimate the distance which the ship had travelled. But time, the

 strength of the wind, and the pilot's knowledge of the qualities of his ship, stiU

 constituted the principal elements for calculations of this kind, for the * catena a
 poppa ' which Magellan attached to the stern of his ship was merely intended to
 indicate the ship's leeway and not the distance which it had travelled. The log,
 which for the first time enabled the mariner to carry out his dead-reckoning with
 confidence, is first described in Bourne's ' Regiment for the Sea,' which was pub-

 lished in 1577.

      The eminent position wiiich Italian cartographers occupied during the fourteenth
 and fifteenth centuries had to be surrendered by them, in the beginning of the

 sixteenth, to their pupils, the Portuguese and Spaniards, upon whom extensive

 voyages and discoveries had coaierred exceptional advantages. These, in turn, had
 to yield to the Germans, and later on to the Dutch, who were specifically qualified to
 become the reformers of cartography by their study of mathematics and of the
 ancient geographers, as also by the high degree of perfection which the arts of
 engraving on wood and copper had attained among them. German mathematicians
 first ventured to introduce the long-neglected geographical projections of Hip-
 parchus and Ptolemy, and devised others of their own. Werner of Niirnberg
 (1514) invented an equivalent heart-shaped projection, whilst both Apianus and
 Staben (1620 and 1522) suggested equivalent projections. StiU greater were the
 services of Gerhard Cremer, or Mercator (1512-94), the Ptolemy of the sixteenth
 century, who not only introduced the secant conical projection, but also invented
 that still known by his name, which was calculated to render such great service to
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  700

the navigator, but was nevertheless not universally accepted until the middle of
the iifteenth century, when the mediaeval compass and plane charts finally dis-
appeared.

    The German cartographers of that age are to be commended, not because they

-- --copied Ptolemy's maps for iu this they had been preceded by others but because

they adopted his scientific methods in producing maps of their own. Their reforms
began at home, as all reforms should. They were amply supported in their efforts

by the many astronomers of note of whom Germany then boasted, and by quite a
stafi' of local ' geographers,' of whom nearly every district of the empire boasted
the possession of one. Among tliese local maps, that of Bavaria, by Philipp
Bienewitz, or Apianus (1566), holds a distinguished place, for it is the first map on

a large scale (1 : 144,000) based upon a regular survey. Its errors iu latitude do
not exceed V, and those in longitude 3', which is marvellously correct considering
the age of its production. Like most maps of the period, it is engraved on wood,
for though the art of engraving on copper was invented in Germany before 1446,
and the first map was engraved there in 1450, copper engraving only became
general at a much later date.

     Perhaps the earliest general map of Germany, and certainly one of the most
interesting, was that which the famous Cardinal Nicolas of Cues or Cusa com-
pleted in 1464, the only existing copy of which is to be found in the British Museum,
where it was 'discovered' by Baron Nordenskjold. Mercator's map of Germany,
published more than a century after that of the learned Cardinal (in 1585), was
naturally far more complete in all respects, and was certainly far superior to the
maps of any other country existing at that time. This fact is brought home to us
by an inspection of a collection of maps to be found in the well-known Theatrum
Orbis of OrteUus (first published in 1570), where we may see that the maps
supplied by Humphrey Lloyd and other British cartographers are still without

degree lines.

    But when we follow Mercator, or, in fact, any other cartographer of the period,

into regions the successful delineation of which depended upon an intelligent inter-
pretation of itineraries and of other information collected by travellers, they are
found to fail utterly. Nowhere is this utter absence of the critical faculty more
glaringly exhibited than in the maps of Africa of that period.

    Among the Dutch cartographers of that age one of the foremost places must be

accorded to Waghenaer of Enkhuizen, whose ' Mirror of the Sea,' a collection of
charts published in 1583, enjoyed a considerable reputation among British seamen.
Other famous Dutch publishers of charts were Ortelius, Janssen, Blaeuw, and
Vischer, who accumulated large stocks of copperplates, wbich constituted valuable
heirlooms, and, not unlike the plates of certain modern map-publishers, supplied
edition after edition without undergoing any change, except perhaps that of the

date.

     The age of great discoveries was past. All blanks upon our maps had not yet
been filled up, but the contours of the great continents stood out distinctly, and in
the main correctly. Discoveries on a large scale had become impossible, except in
the Polar regions and in the interior of some of the continents ; but greater precise-
ness had to be given to the work already done, and many details remained to be
filled in. In this ' Age of Measurements,' as Peschel significantly calls it, better
instruments, and methods of observation superior to those which had sufficed
hitherto, were needed, and were readily forthcoming.

     Picard, by making use of the telescope in measuring angles (1667), obtained
results of a degree of accuracy formerly quite unattainable, even with instruments
of huge proportions. For the theodolite, that most generally useful surveying
instrument, we are indebted to Jonathan Sission (1737 or earlier). More impor-
tant still, at all events to the mariner, was the invention of the sextant, generally
ascribed to Hadley (1731), but in reality due to the genius of Newton. Equally
important was the production of a trustworthy chronometer by John Harrison
(1761), which first made possible the determination of meridian distances, and ia
invaluable whenever a correct knowledge of the time is required. One other instru-

ment, quite recently added to the apparatus of tlie surveyor, is the photographic
camera, converted for his especial benefit into a photofframmeter. This instrument
can perhaps never be utilised for ascertaining the relative positions of celestial bodies,
but has already done excellent service in ordinary surveying, especially when it is
required to portray the sides of inaccessible mountains.

     But the full fruits of these inventions could be enjoyed only after Bradley had
discovered the aberration of light (1728) and the nutation of the earth 's axis (1747)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

Domenique Cassini had furnished trustworthy tables of the refraction of light ; and
the complicated movement of the moen had been computed by Euler (1746), Tobias
Mayer (1753), Bradley (1770), and, more recently by Hansen.

      Positively novel methods for determining the latitude and longitude of a place

can scarcely be said to have been proposed during this period, but many of the
older methods only became really available after the improvements in the instru-
ments indicated above had taken place, and the computations had been freed
from the errors which vitiated them formerly.

     Eeal progress, however, has been made in the determination of altitudes.
Formerly they could be ascertained only by trigonometrical measurement, or by a
laborious process of levelling, but since physicists have shown how the decrease of
atmospheric pressure with the altitude, and the boiling-point of water depending
upon this decrease, afforded a ready means of determining heights, the barometer,
aneroid, and boiling-point thermometer have become the indispensable companions
of the explorer, and our knowledge of the relief of the land has advanced rapidly.

     Equally rapid have been the improvements in our instruments for measuring
the depth of the ocean, since a knowledge of the configuration of its bed was
demanded by the practical requirements of the telegraph engineers.

    And in proportion as the labours of the surveyoi's and explorers gained in pre-

ciseness, so did the cartographer of the age succeed in presenting the results achieved

in a manner far more satisfactory than had been done by his predecessors. His

task was comparatively easy so long as he only dealt with horizontal dimensions,

though even in the representation of these a certain amount of skill and judgment

is required to make each feature tell in proportion to its relative importance.

The delineation of the inequalities of the earth's surface, however, presented far

greater difficulties. The mole-hills or serrated ridges, which had not yet quite

disappeared from our maps in the beginning of this century, failed altogether in

doing justice to our actual knowledge. The first timid attempt to represent

hills as seen from a bird's-eye view, and of shading them according to the steep-

ness of their slopes, appear on a map of the Breisgau, published by Homann in

We1718.                                               find this system fully developed on La Condamine's map of Quito,

published in 1751, and it was subsequently popularised by Arrowsmith. In this

crude system of hill shading, however, everything was left to the judgment of the

draughtsman, and only after Lehmann (1783) had superimposed it upon a ground-

work of contours, and had regulated the strength of the hatching in accordance

with the degree of declivity to be represented did it become capable of conveying

a correct idea of the configuration of the ground.

    The first to fully recognise the great importance of contours was Philip

Buache, who had prepared a contoured map of the Channel in 1737, and suggested

that the same system might profitably be extended to a delineation of the relief

of  the land                                          and  this  idea, subsequently taken  up by Ducarla of Vabres, was for
                                                   ;

the first time carried into practice by Dupain-Triel, who published a contoured

map of France in 1701. Up to the present time more than eighty methods of

showing the hills have been advocated, but it may safely be asserted that none

of these methods can be mathematically correct unless it is based upon horizontal

contours.

     The credit of having done most towards the promotion of cartography in the
course of the eighteenth century belongs to France. It was France which fii-st
equipped expeditions to determine the size of the earth ; France which produced

--the first topographical map based upon scientific survey a work begun by C^sar

Franfois Cassinl in 1744, and completed by his son five years after his lather's

death                               it was France           again which     gave        birth to D'AnviUe,     the  first  critical
                                 ;

cartographer whom the world had ever seen.

Delisle (1675-17:^6), a pupil of Cassini's, had already been able to rectify the

maps of the period by utilising the many astronomical observations which French

travellei'S had brought home from all parts of the world. This work of reform

was carried further by D'Anville (1697-1782), who swept away the fanciful lakes

from oft' the face of Africa, thus forcibly bringing home to us the poverty of our

knowledge                                              who  boldly refused  to believe  in  the  existence of  an Antarctic con-
                                                    ;

tinent covering half the southern hemisphere, and alwaj'S brought sound judgment

to bear upon the materials which the ever-increasing number of travellers placed

At his disposal. And whilst France led the way, England did not lag far behind.

In that countrj' the discoveries of Cook and of other famous navigators, and the

spread of British power in India, gave the first impulse to a more diligent cultiva-

tion of the art of representing the surface of the earth on maps. There, to a greater

extent than on the Continent, the necessities of the navigator called into existence

a vast number of charts, amongst which are many hundreds of sheets published by

Dalrymple and Joseph Desbarres (1776). Faden, one of the most prolific pub-

lishers of maps, won distinction especially for his county maps, several of which,

like that of Surrey by Linley and Gardner, are based upon trigonometrical surveys

carried on by private individuals. England was the first to follow the lead of

France in undertaking a regular topographical survey (1785). Nor did she lack

critical cartographers. James Rennell (b. 1742) sagaciously arranged the vast

mass of important information collected by British travellers in India and Africa;

but it is chiefly the name of Aaron Arrowsmith (died 1823) with which the glory

of the older school of English cartographers is most intimately connected. Arrow-

smith became the founder of a family of geographers, whose representative in the

third generation, up to the date of his death in 1873, worthily upheld the ancient

reputation of the family. Another name which deserves to be gTatefully remem-
bered is that of John Walker, to whom the charts published by our Admiralty

are indebted for that per-spicuous, firm, and yet artistic execution which, whilst it

enhances their scientific value, also facilitates their use by the mariner.

Since the beginning of the present centitry Germany has once more become the

Tiead-quarters of scientific cartography ; and this is due as much to the inspiriting

teachings of a Hitter and a Humboldt as to the general culture and scientific

training, combined with technical skill, commanded by the men who more

especially devoted themselves to this branch of geography, which elsewhere was

too frequently allowed to fall into the hands of mere mechanics. Men like

Berghaus, Henry Kiepert, and Petermann, the best-known pupil of the first of

these, must always occupy a foremost place in the history of our department of

knowledge. Berghaus, who may be truly described as the founder of the modern

school of cartography, and who worked under the immediate inspiration of a Ritter

and a Humboldt, presented us with the first comprehensive collection of physical

maps (1837). Single maps of this kind had, no doubt, been publi.shed before
Kircher (1665) had produced a map of the ocean currents, Edmund Halley (1686)
had embodied the results of his own researches in maps of the winds and of the

--variation of the compass (1686), whilst Hitter himself had compiled a set of

physical maps (1806) but no work of the magnitude of Berghaus's famous

Physical Atlas had seen the light before. Nor could it have been published even

then had it not been for the unstinted support of a firm like that of Justus Perthes,

already the publisher of Stieler's Atlas (1817-23), and subsequently of many other

works which have carried its fame into every quarter of the globe.

    And now, at the close of this nineteenth centurj^, we may fairly boast that

the combined science and skill of surveyors and cartographers, aided as they are

by the great advance of the graphic arts, are fuUy equal to the production of a
map which shall be a faithful image of the earth's surface. Let us imagine for one

moment that an ideal map of this kind were before us, a map exhibiting not merely

the features of the land and the depth of the sea, but also the extent of forests and
712 REPORT 1891

of pasture-lauds, the distribution of human hcabitations, and all those features the-
representation of which has become familiar to us through phj-sical and statistical
athses. Let us then anah'se the vast mass of facts thus placed before us, and we

--shall find that they form quite naturally two well-defined divisions namely, those

of physical and political greography, whilst the third department of our science,
mathematical geography, deals with the measurement and survey of our earth, the
ultimate outcome of which is the production of a perfect map.

     I shall abstain from giving a laboured definition of what I consider geography
should embrace, for definitions of this kind help practical workers but little, and will
never deter anyone who feels disposed and capable from straying into fields which
an abuse of logic has clearly demonstrated to lie outside his proper domain. But
I wish to enforce the fact that topography and chorography, the description of
particular places or of entire countries, should always be looked upou as integral
portions of geographical research. It is they which furnish man}^ of the blocks
needed to rear our geographical edifice, and which constitute the best training
school for the education of practical geographers, as distinguished from mere

theorists.

That our maps, however elaborate, should be supplemented by descriptions will

not even be gainsaid by those who are most reluctant to grant us our independent

existence among the sciences which deal with the earth and its inhabitants.

WeThis concession, however, can never content us.  cannot allow ourselves to be

Wereduced to the position nf mere collectors of facts.       claim the right to discu.«s

ourselves the facts we have collected, to analyse them, to generalise from them,

and to trace the correlations between cause and effect. It is thus that geography

becomes comparative ; and whilst comparative physical geography, or morphology,

seeks to explain the origin of the existing surface features of our earth, compai'ative

political geography, or anthropo-geography, as it is called by Dr. Ratzel, one of

the most gifted representatives of geographical science in Germany, deals with man

in relation to the geographical conditions which influence him. It is this depart-

ment of geography which was so fruitfully cultivated by Karl Ritter.

Man is indeed in a large measure 'the creature of his environment,' for who

Can doubt for a moment that geographical conditions have largely influenced

the destinies of nations, have directed the builders of our towns, determined the

paths of migrations and the march of armies, and have impressed their stamp even

upon the character of those who have been subjected to them for a sufficiently

extended period.

The sterile soil of Norway, bordering upon a sea ric-h in fish, converted the

Norwegians first into fishermen, and then into the bold marinei's who ravaged the

shores of Western Europe and of the Mediterranean and first dared to cross the

broad waves of the Atlantic. Can it be doubted that the uniformly broad plains

of Eastern Europe contributed largely to the growth of an empire like that of

Russia, stretching fi'om the Arctic to the Black Sea ; or that the more varied con-

figuration of Western and Southern Europe promoted the development of distinct

nationalities, each having a history of its own, and presenting individual traits

which characteristically mark it ofl^ from its neighbours ?

The intelligent political geographer cannot contemplate the great river systems

of the continents without becoming aware that their influence has been very

diverse, and is not solely dependent upon size or volume. The rivers of Siberia,

ice-bound during the greater part of the year, run to waste into an inhospitable

ocean, which even our modern resource of steam has failed to render really acces-

sible. They contrast very unfavourably, notwithstanding their huge .size, with the

far smaller rivers of Northern Europe, which open freely into the sea and afford

navigable highways into the very heart of the continent. And these European-

rivers, fed as they are by rains falling in all seasons, and by the ice stored up in

the recesses of the Alps, again differ very widely in their character from the rivers

of tropical regions, dependent upon an intermittent supply of rain. Again, who

can look upon such mighty rivers as the Amazon and Mississippi without becoming

conscious of the fact that they have given geographical unity to regions of vast
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.                                                                                                                                                                            713

--extent, whicb, had their drainage been difierent, would have presented all the

variety which we meet with in Europe a variety which has proved so favoiu'able
to the progress of human culture and civilisation ?

It is an old remark that climatic conditions exercise a most powerful influence

upon man, and that the development of countries, where Nature yields the neces-

saries of life without requiring a serious effort on the part of the inhabitants, has

been very different from those whose climatic conditions compel the putting forth

of a certain amount of well-directed energy to make life bearable, or even possible.
    These instances of the dependence of human development upon natural resources

and geographical features might be multiplied, and their study must at all times be

profitable and instructive. It must not, however, be assumed for one moment that
this dependence of man upon Nature is absolute. The natural resources of a

country require for their full development a people of energy and capacity ; and
instances in which they have been allowed to lie dormant, or have been wasted, are

numerous. What were America and Australia, as long as they remained only the

homes of the wandering savages who originally inhabited them ; and what has

become of certain countries of the East, at one time among the most flourishing
regions of the earth, but presenting now a most deplorable picture of exhaustion

and decay ? The geographer must not shut his eye to the fact that the existing

state of affairs is not merely the outcome of given geographical conditions and

natural resources, but has in a large measure been brought about by man's conquests

Weover the forces of Nature.  do not exaggerate, for instance, when we assert

that the introduction of steam as a motive force has largely changed the geographi-

cal relations of countries. By facilitating intercourse between distant regions, and

encouraging travel, it has tended to uniformity among nations, and rendered avail-

Aable for the common good resources which otherwise must have lain fallow.

tunnel, such as that under the Saint Gotthard, may not have ' abolished ' the Alps,
but it certainly has brought the populations who occupy their opposite slopes
nearer to each other, and has given a new direction to commerce.

Perhaps one of the most instructive illustrations of the complex human agencies

which tend to modify the relative importance of geogi'aphical conditions is pre-

sented to us by the Mediterranean. The time when this inland sea was the centre

of civilisation and of the world's commerce, whilst the shores of Western Europe

were only occasionally visited by venturesome navigators or conquering Roman

hosts, does not lie so very far behind us. England, at that period, turned her face

towards Continental Europe, of which it was a mere dependency. The prosperity

of the Mediterranean countries survived far into the middle ages, and Italy at one

time enjoyed the enviable position of being the great distributor of the products of

the East, which found their way across the Alps into Germany, and through the

gates of Gibraltar to the exterior ocean. But a change was brought about,

partly through the closing of the old Oriental trade routes, consequent upon the

conquests of the Turks, partly through the discovery of a new world and of a
maritime highway to India. When Columbus, himself an Italian, returned from

the West Indies in 1493, and Vasco da Gama brought the first cargo of spices from

India in 1490, the star of Italy began to fade. And whilst the spices of the Indies

and the gold of Guinea poured wealth into the lap of Portugal, and Spain grew

opulent on the silver mines of Mexico and Peru, Venice was vainly beseeching

the Sultan to re-open the old trade route through the Red Sea. The dominion of

the sea had passed from Italy to Spain and Portugal, and passed later on to the

Dutch and English. But mark how the great geographical discoveries of that age

aff'ected the relative geographical position of England ! England no longer lay on

the skirts of the habitable world, it had become its very centre. And this natural

advantage was enhanced by the colonial policies of Spain and Portugal, who exhausted

their strength in a task far beyond their powers, took possession of tropical countries

only, and abandoned to England the less attractive but in reality far more valuable

regions of North America. England was thus enabled to become the founder of

real colonies, the mother of nations                                                                                                                                                                  and her language, customs, and political insti-
                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

tutions found a home in a new world.

And now, when the old highway through the Red Sea has been reopened,
714  KEPOiiT-- 1891.

when the wealth flowing through the Canal of Suez is beginning to revivify the
commerce of Italy, England may comfort herself with the thought that in her own
·colonies and in the states which have sprung up across the Atlantic she may find
ample compensation for any possible loss that may accrue to her through geographi-

cal advantages being once more allowed to have full play.

    I am afraid I have unduly tried your patience. I believe you will agree with
me that no single individual can be expected to master all those departments which
are embraced within the wide field of geography. Even the master-mind of a
Humboldt fell short of this, and facts have accumulated since his time at an appal-

ling rate. All that can be expected of our modern geographer is that he should
command a comprehensive general view of his field, and that he should devote his
energies and capacities to the thorough cultivation of one or more departments that

lie witliin it.

     The following Papers were read :

1. The Art of Observing. By John Coles, F.B.A.S., Map Curator mid

     Instructor in Practical Astronomy and Surveying to the Royal Geo-

      graphical Society.

     In this paper the art of observing with portable instruments, for latitude and
longitude, is described, as well as the use of such simple surveying instruments as
the plane table and prismatic compass. The dirterent methods suitable to explorers
of fixing positions by astronomical observations are explained, and the manner in

which they may be taken so as to ehminate errors is pointed out. The latter part

of the paper deals with surveying, fixing heights by barometer, route surveying in
a jungle or forest, and concludes with a description of the Solar Compass attach-
ment, as applied to theodolites for finding the true meridian, and some remarks on

Mercator's projection in cases where it is required to lay down bearings, &c., or
plot a route. The author also calls attention to the fact that such instruments as
the plane table and prismatic compass might be used with advantage in schools,
and that such practical teaching in the field could not fail to give pupils a more
intimate knowledge of the principle on which maps are constructed and surveys

carried out than they could gain in any other way.

                     2. Recent Geographical Progress in Great Britain.

                                    By J. Scott Keltie.

    Mr. Keltie referred to the efforts made by the Royal Geographical Society
during tbe last twenty-six years to improve the position of geography in British
schools. For about twenty years the Society offered prizes annually to be com-
peted for by the pupils of the great public schools ; but very few schools availed
themselves of the examination, and so few candidates came forward that the
scheme was dropped. The Society also instituted a course of lectures by eminent
men of science on various aspects of geography, in order to improve the prevailing
conception of the subject, but this also had little result.

     In 1884 the Society appointed Mr. Keltie to conduct an inquiry into the posi-
tion of geography in educational institutions in Great Britain and in the Continent

of Europe. He visited the leading schools in the British Islands, conferred with

the University authorities of Oxford and Cambridge, and inquired into the posi-

tion of the subject in the examinations for the public service. He visited France,
Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Belgium, Holland, and made inquiries con-

cerning other European countries, as well as the United States of America. Mr.
Keltie also collected the materials for an exhibition of appliances used in geogra-

phical education. He presented to the Society a report on the results of his

inquiry. The exhibition was held in London, Birmingham, Bradford, and Edin-
burgh, and in connection therewith a series of lectures on various aspects of geo-
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.                                                715

 grapliy were given by a number of specialists. On the basis of the report and its
 recommendations, the Council of the Royal Geographical Society took action in
 order to improve the position of geography in the British Islands. The result

 during- the past six years has, on the whole, been satisfoctory.

       Lecturers (ranking with professors) of geography have been appointed at the
 Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, where before the subject was not recog-
 nised. The Oxford lecturer, Mr. H. J. Mackinder, has been most successful, and

at that university the subject is taking an important place, both on its own

 account and in its relations to the historical and scientific studies of the university.
 It is hoped that in Cambridge equally satisfactory progress will be made.

      The great public schools are influenced by the universities ; but as yet the
general subject is not recognised in these schools as it ought to be, though physical
geography is generally taught. Even in these schools, however, there are signs

of improvement. Among the mass of middle-class schools, the subject is spread-

ing, and a higher conception begins to prevail.

     In the elementary schools, which are now under Government jurisdiction, the
programme prescribed is highly satisfactory, though unfortunately the subject is

not compulsory. In the training colleges or normal schools the position of geo-
graphy is, on the whole, satisfactory ; the Royal Geographical Society awards
prizes each year on the results of the examinations in geogi-aphy in the normal

schools.

      In the lectures which are given all over the country to thousands of students
by members of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, geography holds an

important place. What is known as commercial geography is also attracting

great attention.

     As a result of the action of the Society the general conception of geography has
greatly improved in England ; the leaders of the movement of reform, following

Ritter and Peschel and their disciples, regard geography mainly as dealing with
the earth's surface as the topographical environment of humanity.

European domination, (2) areas of highest relative value to the European PowerS;

Aand (3) the intermediate or transitional regions.  free reading of the map shows

the lines of least resistance against the European domination in Africa.

     The following Papers were read :

          1. On Acclimatisation.^ By Robert W. Felkin, M.D.

     The subject of acclimatisation increases in importance every year, and during
the past few years many papers have been read in reference to it. It is therefore
\ery difdcult to find anything new to say about it. There are two schools of

     ' Printed in full in the Scottish OeojrapMcal Magazine, p. 647, December 1891.
716 REPORT-- 1891.

thought, the one regarding acclimatisation as impossible, the other more sanguine-
and pronouncing it possible. Piobably the truth will be found to be a mean betweea
the two. In considering the subject, it is necessary to specify first, the various nations
who are to be acclimatised, and secondly, the places where they are to be located.
As regards the first point, the national characteristics, habits, customs, and environ-
ment must be taken into account, and with respect to the second, the nature of the
country, its climatology, its inhabitants, their mortality and endemic diseases must
be brought under survey. The next point is to classify the various European
nations, and it becomes evident that they can only become readily acclimatised in
the temperate zone, where climatic and other conditions are approximately akin to

their present habitat.

     In reference to Europeans becoming acclimatised in the Tropics, what are

--those factors which prevent it or which must be overcome before it is

possible ? They are as follows : Heat, cold, damp, various endemic diseases,
especially malaria, and those constitutional conditions induced by climate which
either destroy the immigrants or diminish their fertility after one or two genera-
tions. Progress has been made during recent years in enabling persons to reside

longer and to enjoy greater health in the Tropics. What probability is there that

science will accomplish still more in rendering acclimatisation possible for
Europeans in tropical countries ?

                2. Changes in Coast Lines. By Dr. J. S. Phene.

     Dr. Pheu6 pointed out that the changes in the configuration of the coast lines
of the earth exceeded even the large estimate of those who attributed so much to
erosion by rivers, glaciers, and general aqueous causes. The contiguous currents
in the Gulf of Florida, which originated the Gulf Stream, attested by the result*
of their operation decades of millions of years and the configuration of what

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

were now the British Islands appeared mainly due to that influence.

     3. Morocco as a Field for Geographers. By J. E. Budgett Meakin.

     Only a small portion of the country is at all fairly known, and on the whole it

may be considered, not only for geographers, but for all men of science, as virgin soil.

Only one traveller has explored the famous Atlas to any extent, and given to
the world satisfactory maps and other topographical data. This is the Baron de

Foucauld, who travelled some years ago in the disguise of a Jewish Rabbi. The
failure of all others who have attempted this task has been due to their unsuit-

ability, chieflj' arising from their ignorance of the people and the language. Rohlfs
penetrated as far as De Foucauld, on the whole, but had no means of preserving a
scientific record. The only authority with regard to the flora and geology of any
portion of the highlands is the work of Hooker and Ball. There is no reliable

map of Morocco, the only real attempt having been made by Capt. Baudouin, for
the French War Office, in 1848. This is compiled partly from actual observation

and the records of travellers, but for the most part depends on the vague informa-
tion of natives.

     The configuration of the Atlas is considerably diflerent from that shown on
most maps. Instead of one long chain stretching in a south-westerly direction, it
is in reality composed of three more or less parallel lines, which are best defined as
the Medium, the Great, and the Lesser Atlas ; the first named being the northern-
most, and the last bordering on the Sahara. Of these only the centre of the Great
Atlas has been to any extent explored.

   4. On the Aborigines of Western Australia. By Miss E. M. Clerke,

     The monastic settlement of New Nursia, seventy miles from Perth, in Westero

 Australia, is the most striking refutation of the generally received belief in the
 irredeemable degradation of the Australian aborigines. Founded in 1846, by two

Spanish Benedictines, Fathers Serra and Salvado, who gradually won the con-
fidence of the natives by sharing their pursuits, it now forms a flourishing

vast cultivated domain, workshops for different trades, and a native village of

about fifty cottages inhabited by as many Christian families. One of the girls

trained here ife in receipt of a Government salary as head of the post and telegraph
office ; in which, when absent on sick leave, she was efficiently replaced on short
notice by one of her companions. The boys, too, learn with great facility, and

many of them prove steady tradesmen or trustworthy servants and foremen.

In the wild state these aborigines are cannibals who devour the flesh of their own

6. The Application of Indian. Geographical Survey Methods to Africa.^

                    By Lieut.-Colonel "T. H. Holdich, B.E.

     The origin of the paper is requests from private sources for information as to
the best methods of commencing surveys in Africa. These surveys may be assumed

to be of a geographical rather than a revenue class, and to have in view objects

similar to those obtained by the geographical surveys carried out by Indian survey

officers. An outline of the methods proposed may be summarised as

1. The adoption of a rapid system of triangulation along the most important

lines for first survey.

2. The extension of a graphic system of mapping from these lines by means

chiefly of native labour.

The most important lines for first survey are the international boundary lines.

Until lately England has been peculiarly free from the necessity of demarcating or

maintaining national boundaries. Even India offers but a comparatively short

line for defence. The new partition of Africa largely increases her responsibilities
in this respect, though there may be no immediate cause for action.

There is, however, a great necessity for a topographical acquaintance with the

boundaries adopted. Only a small portion of them apparently follow permanent

natural features, the rest being defined by rivers, &c.

Danger of river boundaries and uncertainty of some other forms of boundary.

It would appear, then, advantageous to commence triangulation along the

boundary lines. This is, however, so far a national or international question, and

consequently in these preliminary stages of survey State assistance might very

well be expected, and Imperial resources drawn upon for carrying it out.

    1. What are these resources ?
    2. What is the nature of surveys already existing in Africa ?
    3. What is the nature of the survey we ought to build up ?

Replying to 2 and 3 we find that if a continuous and comprehensive scheme is

to be adopted, with unity of design for all the scattered districts of the African

colonial system, nothing has very much been done as yet which would assist us in

carrying out our scheme. This scheme should be largely borrowed from experi-

Aences in Asia.  consideration of it shows (in reply to 1) to what extent Imperial

 survey resources might be utilised during the processes of laying out the pre*

 liminary lines of triangulation. From this triangulation the extension of topo-
 graphy would thereafter probably depend on private enterprise.

      Then follows a short consideration of the general topographical processes as
carried out by natives of India, of the value of such native labour, and of the
possibiUty of raising survey establishments in Africa similar to those which have
done such excellent work in Asia.

1. Suggestions for the Revision and Improvement of the Large Scale Maps of
                 the Ordnance Survey. By Henry T. Crook, G.E.

     Reforms having been promised in the Ordnance Survey productions, it is desira-
ble to consider whether the large scale plans and maps answer the requirements of

those who chiefly use them, namely, engineers, geologists, and other scientific men,
and those engaged in the administration of imperial and local affairs. The purposes
which the Cadastral Survey has to subserve are constantly increasing with the

advance of scientific knowledge. It is admitted that the production of this class of
maps is a proper function of Government. The efficiency of the organisation and
the accuracy of the work done by the survey department is not disputed, but there

is room for much improvement in the style of maps published, and in the amoimt
of information conveyed. No adequate provision has been made for the revision
of the survey, and in consequence a very large portion of the maps is obsolete.
The author makes suggestions for clearing off the arrears of revision work, and for
maintaining the survey maps reasonably up to daie. He proposes that the country
should be divided into districts under superintendents, each district ofiice being

charged with the revision of the maps of its district within a limited period. He

suggests that the services of these district offices might be at the disposal of anyone
requiring plans or maps with manuscript corrections up to date on payment of

suitable fees. He thinks by these means the cost of maintaining the survey would

be materially reduced. Then follow some suggestions for improving the six-inch
county maps, and he concludes by urging that the scale of prices should be revised,
and that better indexes should be provided for the different maps.

5. The Geography of South-West Africa.^ By Dr. Henrt Schlichter.

South-West Africa is in many respects only imperfectly known to geographers.

Our information about Great Namaqualand, the western Kalahari, the large Kaoko'

district, and the belt between the Atlantic Ocean and the highlands of the interior
is by no means satisfactory. Since Germany has acquired territories in South-
West Africa many scientific and other travellers have traversed the German sphere
of influence, and hereby contributed to our knowledge of the country. But geo-
graphical science has not yet gained much by these recent German explorations,

for, with the exception of a few books and scientific publications, all the information
has reached the public and been preserved only in various German papers and
periodicals, mixed with many more or less unimportant colonial matters. The
author has therefore tried to collect the geographically important facts from these

sources.

Moreover, the old explorations of South-West Africa needed revision. Mr.

Theal, who has searched the archives of the Cape colony, has recently discovered

that the Orange River was known before Gordon i-eached it in 1777, and that in

1761-62 a well-equipped expedition penetrated into the interior of Namaqualand,

much farther north than Paterson, Gordon, and other travellers did. In 1791-92

a second exploring party reached a point still further north. But these interesting

journeys were soon afterwards forgotten. The author has found that the British

Museum contains the full diary (printed in Amsterdam, 1778) of the first of these

expeditions, and as Mr. Theal has given only short reports, without going into

geographical details, the author has examined this diary and compared it with the

Heliterature of the present and the last century.  finds that this old expedition is

of considerable importance for our knowledge of South-West Africa.

The object of the author in this paper, therefore, is to collect and criticise the

new and old reports unknown to geographers and to give a correct account

of the present state of the geography of South-West Africa.

   --General. Florida is a peninsula witli certain unique characteristics. Though

an integral part of North America, a large portion of it belongs, climatically and

botanically, to the "West Indies. The southern half of the ))eninsula is sub-

tropical, the extreme south tropical. Florida lies between 24° 25' and 31° 0'

N.  Lat.                     80°  2'  and  87°  37' W.  Long.  Its area is 58,680 square miles--about
                          ;

that of England and Wales. Of this, 4,440 square miles are water. The extreme

length is 465 miles, of which 400 miles belong to peninsular Florida and 65 miles

to continental Florida. The average breadth of the peninsula is 100 miles. The

--coast line is variously estimated about 1,200 miles is approximate. Florida,

though the largest of the States E. of the Mississippi, is one-third the size of

California. It is forty-tive times the size of Rhode Island. The west, south, and

east coasts are much influenced by the Gulf Stream, which escapes into the Atlantic

through the Florida Strait ; as it turns northward along the S.E. coast, it is a

volume of water 2,000 feet deep, SO miles wide, flowing with a velocity of live

miles an hour, and possessing a temperature of 84° Fahr. The most remarkable

inlet is the Indian River, on the E. coast. It is about 130 miles in length from
N. to S., is salt and tidal, has an average width of a mile, and is seldom further
than a mile from the ocean. The southern extremity of the peninsula is a net-
work of lagoous and reefs united and formed by mangroves, and presenting to the

--Gulf Stream the long barrier of coral reefs known as the Florida Keys.
     Surface. With the exception of Louisiana, Florida has the lowest average
               _
altitude of any State in the Union. The low watershed of the peninsula follows

the anticlinical whose axis runs N. and S. through the central and northern
regions, and it spreads out here and there into a low group of rolling hills. The

lottiest point is Table Mountain, by Lake Apopka, and is barely 500 feet. The
altitude of the great swampy tract called the Everglades (10,000 square mUes),
which lies in the extreme south, is, at its northern point, 16 feet, and at its

southern point 5-5 feet above sea-level. The majority of the lakes are situated in

the higher rolling country at altitudes from 150 to 300 feet ; but there are many
that are low--e.^. Okeechobee (1,000 square miles), 20-44 feet. The main aspect

of the surface is rolling country with light sandy soil, and heavy and continuous

forests of long-leaved yellow pine {Pinus australis), pitch pine {Pinns ciibensis).

Low hummocks frequently occur with clayey soil, topped with fibrous humus, and

having dense growth of cypress (Ta.iodiutn distichum), red bay (Persea caro-

Unensis), live oak ( Quercus virens), palmetto, magnolias, mahogany, swamp ash
(Fraxinus viridis), Ficus aurea, &c. Numerous rivers and streams, and about

--1,500 lakes and 'springs,' diversify the surface. Swamps and 'prairies' low
--grassy land with standing water are frequent.

  --Hydrography. Florida is dominated by water. It has numerous rivers, and

streams, and lakes. Nineteen of its rivers are at present navigated by steamers

to a total distance of 1,000 miles. The waterway navigable by boats is nearly
ten times this length. The only important rivers that empty into the Atlantic

·are the St. Mary's and St. John's Rivers. The former forms the natural boundary

which, after a N.W. course of 300 miles, it flows. Into the Gulf of Mexico flow

the Caloosahatchee, draining Lake Okeechobee ; the Peace River, which rises in

the highlands west of Lake Kissimmee, and flows S.W. ; the Withlacoochee, rising

in the same highlands, and flowing N.W. ; the Suwannee rising in the Okefenokee

swamp of  Georgia                                         and the Apalachicola.
                                                       ;

    Of lakes and ' springs ' there are about 1,500. Some are mere expansions of a.

river's coTirse, but the majority occur in the high rolling district which runs N.

and S. through the peninsula. Okeechobee (1,000 square miles) is the largest.
The water is quite clear. The springs are sulphurous, and occur everywhere.

Silver Spring, 200 yards in diameter and 30 yards deep, is the largest.

   --Climate. The water surface of Florida is 4,440 square miles. The isotherms run
--from W. to E. in an E.N.E. N.E. direction. The isotherm of 75° mean annual

runs fromTampaBayto Cape Canaveral, and represents that of the important section

of central or semi-tropical Florida. The average mean of Jacksonville, the in-

dustrial capital, and the northern limit of the orange belt, for twenty years has

been for January 55° and for August 82°. At Key West, sub-tropical Florida,
the mean for January is 71-04°, and for August 84-33°, The annual mean

humidity is 68-8. Rainfall during the five winter months at Jacksonville = 16-62

at Key West 9-10. The annual rainfall at Jacksonville is 54 inches. The pre-

vailing winds are from the S.E., blowing from the tropics over the heated Gulf

Stream and N.E., also over the stream. This makes the E. coast milder than the

W. The W. coast also occasionally suflers from a cold ' snap,' which has descended

the Mississippi Valley.

   --Geology and Soil. As far as has yet been ascertained, the oldest strata are,

if not coeval, at least similar or equivalent to the Tertiaries of the Thames Valley,

or those of the Paris Basin. But all the divisions of the Tertiaries are represented.
The Eocene is present in great depth ; the Miocene and Pliocene are less thick

Pleistocene beds are very thick. Fossil remains have been found, not only of the

mastodon, but of hippopotamus, rhinoceros, tiger, hyena, lion, elephant, and llama.

An anticlinal, with an axis parallel to the peninsula, runs through central and

northern Florida. True coral rock is found continuously in the south and in many

districts further north. Under this are dense beds of limestone, consisting of shells

of marine organisms. C/. reef-limestones of Cuba. The soil is divided into-- (1)

hummocks; (2) 'pine ' or sand lands. Hummock land is low-lying clayey soil, in
which much potash and phosphorus (from decaying vegetation) are found. The

--sand lands contain 50 per cent, soluble matter are a mixture of sand and clay

--of very various mineral character, but uniformly light to work.
     Vegetation. Florida may be divided into three zones according to vegetation.

(1) The northern or continental portion. (2) The central or semi-tropical portion,
whose southern limit extends from the Caloosahatchee ouW,coast(26°35'N.L.) to

the Lidiau River inlet (27°30'N.L.). Iso-floral lines may be drawn from W. to E.

across the peninsula in a direction varying from N.E. to N.N.E. The three divi-

sions might be called southern, semi-tropical, and sub-tropical. Of the 200 species

of forest trees about 38 per cent, are tropical, and similar to those of West Indies.

Many of these trees grow luxuriantly on the Keys and extreme south, but dwindle

The Pbesident delivered the following Address :

I Nationalism ami Oosmopolitanisni in JEconomics.

The year which has elapsed since this Association met at Leeds has afforded

ample evidence of the vitality of economic studies in England at the present time.

It is no small proof of a widely diffused desire to pursue such investigations

seriously that a second edition of such a substantial volume as our late President's

' Principles of Economics ' should have been called for within a few months of the

issue of the first. While, too, economics alone among sciences has been hitherto

unrepresented by any journal or review published in England, the year which has

passed has seen first one and then another quarterly periodical started with the

avowed object of catering for the wants of economic students. The larger of these

magazines has come into being as the organ of an Association which is designed to

do other work for our science besides that which it has already undertaken.

Both of these new ventures deserve a hearty welcome from this Section,

though in different ways, for they have emanated from different sources. The

' Review ' bears on the forefront that it hails from Oxford ; while the ' Journal

and its destinies have been often talked over at Cambridge, and it seems to me, at

least, to be full of the Cambridge spirit. The old contrast between these two

Universities comes out strongly and distinctly. The intense interest which Oxford

has always shown in the study of man and of conduct has put her in practical

touch with many sides of actual life, and has caused her to be the mother of not

a few great movements. But in Cambridge we are so engrossed in the study of

things that we have no time to spare for trying to know ourselves. If we ever

do give our thoughts to man, we like to think of him as if he were a kind of

thing                          so that we may apply the               same                        methods which we        are wont to use in the
                            ;

study of physical phenomena. If we turn our attention to history, we try to

classify the various forms of constitution that have existed on the globe, and then
Wewe call the result Political Science.
                                                                                                      may devote ourselves to Ancient or

Modern Literature, but thev seem to interest us not as vehicles of thought or as

forms of art, but as the bases of Philological or Phonological Science. If we

investigate human industry, we like to treat the individual as if he were a mere

mechanism, and busy ourselves in measuring the force of the motives that may be

brought to bear upon him. It is when we deal with physical things that we can

be precise                                                            this we are determined  to  be  at  all  hazards ;  and of course we may
                                                                   ;

always attain to precision in our statements on human affairs so long as we are

content to be superficial, and are not at pains to jDenetrate to the very heart of the

matter. But indeed there are dangers on either band, whether we give ourselves

as best we may to the study of Man, and deal with Economics in its more human

aspects; or whether we are chietiy interested in the study of things, and try to

                                                                                                                          3 i. 2

make the fullest use we can of the methods and conceptions of physical science for

investigating certain aspects of human affairs. Jn the new periodicals, there is an

excellent corrective against either evil, since the Oxford ' Review ' is largely

written by Cambridge men, and the ' Journal,' which exemplifies the Cambridge

spirit, is edited by an Oxford Professor.

It might almost seem that with all this new activity there is not so much

occasion as there used to be for these annual reunions in Section F. But indeed

it is not so. There is much needful work, which will hardly be done at all unless

it is done here. There are certainly two ways in which this Section offers great

opportunities for promoting economic science, and opportunities which are not

available elsewhere in England. Some points may be rendered clearer by debate,

and this Section affords an open field for such discussions. It is frequently useful

to throw out some hypothesis as a tentative explanation of some group of facts

and the conversations which take place here may help to confirm or to correct a
Asuggestion thus hazarded.
                                                     similar result might be obtained by rejoinders in

the magazines, but there is, at least, a saving of time when opponents can meet

face to lace and thresh out their differences by means of talk.
    It may easily occur, too, that interesting problems are raised and stated rather

than solved by the papers read before this Section ; and the power we have of

selecting special committees, to work throughout tlie year at some particular point

in order to report to this Section at a subsequent meeting, is an instrument for

advancing knowledge which we cannot but value highly.

These advantages might, I conceive, be found in connection with any of the

sciences which are represented in the diffierent sections of this Association. But

there are reasons in the very nature of our science which render it specially

advantageous for economists to take part in such a gathering as this. Our science,

as treated by Mill, and I name him because, whatever our differences may be, I
feel sure we should all regard ourselves as his disciples, rests on certain assump-

tions, and takes for granted results which it does not profess to have investigated

independently. Many of its premises are derived from some branch of physical

science. As Mill has taught us, Political Economy assumes the facts of the

physical world.^ But that is a large order; and the economist may often be

Adoubtful what he is at liberty to assume as a physical fact.                          meeting of the

British Association, where many specialists are brought together, may surely be

turned to good account in connection with this difficulty. In previous years we

have learnt from one of the Sections what we may assuiine about the future pro-

duction  of  gold                          while we  have heard from another what  we  may take  for
                                        ;

Wegranted about the physical possibilities of procuring additional subsistence.

hope to learn from other specialists this year on the one hand about the prospects-

of our coal supply and on the other in regard to the physical effects of prolonged

hours of work. It is no small advantage to have the annual opportunity of

finding more definitely what physical facts we may assume as the bases for

economic argument.

  --Once more and here we come to the feature which distinguishes our science
--from the work of so many of the other Sections Political Economy, as Mill has

taught us, also assumes the facts of human nature ; but human nature and human
institutions vary from age to age, and among different races and in different regions.

It has sometimes been a complaint against economic science that it assumes a

certain type of human being as though it were universal, and that it also takes for

granted the excellent but insular institutions under which we live ; on this point I

shall have more to say presently. But holding, as I do, that some such assumption
may often be a convenient instrument for scientific investigation, I would yet urge

that there can be few better correctives to possible exaggeration and one-sidedness

(from the undue extension of our hypotheses) than that of meeting men who are

liabituated to different temperaments and different institutions from our own, e.g.

to the habits and institutions of our fellow-subjects in India. This Association has
proved to be a convenient centre, which attracts economists from other lands. It
is with genuine pleasure that I welcome, in your name, the visitors from other

countries who have hououred us by joining our gathering to-day. By our inter-
course with them we may surely help to correct insular prejudices, which are
hastily formed and are not unlikely to affect our assumptions about human nature.

      It has been from time to time the task of Presidents of this Section to deal, in
an opening Address, with some fresh economic problem that had forced itself upon
public attention in the immediately preceding year. I must crave your indulgence
if I make no such attempt to-day. For the last thirteen years I liave given such
time as I could spare from clerical duty and the routine of teaching to the study of
English industry and commerce in the past, and I ha\e made no pretence of keeping

myself fully informed about the burning questions of the present day. To me the
burning controversies of two or three centuries ago are much more fascinating,
because we generally know ' how they ended, and we can hope to decide -w-ith some
approximation to truth who was iu the right and who was in the wrong, or how

far both were in the wrong. But after all English history is continuous, and the
economic life of to-day is the outcome of the economic life of the past. I do not
think it will be wholly idle if I try to set before you, however broadly and super-
ficially, some thoughts about economic affairs to-day, as they appear to one who
has spent many hours in trying to habituate himself to the various phases of
economic life and opinion in England during stages of her development which have
passed away for ever.

     During the century which succeeded the Crusades there seems to have been a
Tery rapid development of English industry and commerce ; and if we tried for a
little to place ourselves in thought in that period, we should find ourselves in a
world that was strangely like and yet strangely unlike our own. The dialect
would be unfamiliar, if not unintelligible though we might recognise the well-

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

known churches at Westminster, and Salisbury, and Durham, the aspect of the
landscape with the open fields would be monotonous, the houses would appear mean
and poor, and most of the towns would seem to be big and sleepy villages. While
these were the external characteristics, the habits of thought would strike us as
equally strange, since each village, and each town, was so curiously isolated from its
neighbours. The ideal of good management in every village, controlled as it prac-
tically was by a manorial bailiff", was that it should be self-sufficing and supply its
own wants from its own resources, that it should only buy from the outside world
what it could not produce for itself and could not do without, and should only sell
to the outside world what it had to spare as a surplus. In the towns which were
becoming centres of trade there was more enterprise, but it was carefully controlled
and organised so as to minister to the good of the particular town. No business
man had a wider view ; his town was the economic unit, and afforded the means
by which he was able to enjoy unimpeded intercourse with the inhabitants of other
towns. The prosperity of the town was the economic ideal, and the rivalry of two
towns in the same county, like Lincoln and Boston,^ was as keen as the jealousy
"between French and English fishermen to-day. There appears to have been some
·collective buying of foreign wares for the common advantage of the townsmen,'
but all industry and commerce were organised and regulated under municipal
authority with the view of making them subservient to the advantage of the town
where they were carried on. The manner in which the townsmen contributed to royal
taxation rendered them not unnaturally jealous of anyone who tried to evade his
fair share of public burdens by taking advantage of the facilities which their town

offered for carrying on his trade without helping to discharge the public obliga-
tions. The fact remains that in the thirteenth century commerce was intensely
municipal, that the legal forms which were iu vogue for recovering debts took this

     ' Some few, like the Newfoundland fisheries dispute, never come to an end. It
 was decided in 1697, and settled in 1713 and 1763 ; it was finally laid to rest in 1783,
 but it seems as lively as ever.

municipal type, while writers on political and economic matters ' seemed to assume

that the city was the sort of group -to be regulated and taken into account.
     In Tudor times this local and municipal economy was rapidly superseded by a

laro-er system. There had begn a decided growth of national feeling and a great

deal of national regulation for commerce during the fourteenth and fifteenth

centuries, and as this larger economic life developed the old municipal institutions
were to some extent superseded. In some cases the old institutions had come to

be cramping and positively noxious, so that industry sought other centres and

commerce betook itself to new channels. The precise story of the growth of this

national economic life in England and the corresponding decadence of the old muni-
cipal institutions for industry and commerce is not easy to trace. It may suffice to

say that in the time of Elizabeth the change was practically complete ; and the sub-
sequent development of economic life can be most easily followed when we look at
it from a national rather than a municipal standpoint. From that time onwards

there was, comparatively speaking, free intercourse between the different parts of

the country ; each district, instead of being an isolated unit organised for itself, as

it had been in the time of the first Edward, was treated as contributing its quota
to the material welfare of the nation ; the prosperity of England as a whole, and
the consequent strength of England as a political power, were the ideals which

economists kept consciously in view, and which gave the framework for all their

projects and all their writing on economic topics.

    Here, then, from the time of Elizabeth onwards, we have to deal with a larger

-- --economic organism the Nation, not merely the town but we still find people

pursuing the old economic policy, though they applied it on a much more extended

scale than before. Their leading economic idea was to render the nation self-

suflicing ; to develop its resources, to procure from other countries what England

needed and could not produce for herself, and to sell them the surplus of our native
commodities. If we were able to open a new market for English exports, we
congratulated ourselves that we had got a vent for our surplus. If we mtroduced
a new industry, like the siUv trade, we rejoiced that we could now hope to supply
ourselves with this article instead of purchasing it from the foreigner. If we

planted a colony in some distant region, the trouble and expense was gladly under-

taken in the hope that the products of the new land would render us independent

of some supplies from foreign sources, and thus subserve the economic self-sufficiency

of the English nation : the encouragement given to tobacco-growing in Virginia,

so as to enable us to dispense with supplies which reached us from Spain, is a ca«e in
point. Just as there had been a keen rivalry in the thirteenth century between
neighbouring towns, so in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries there was the

keenest  rivalry  between  diflerent  nations                                      a rivalry which was fundamentally
                                                                                ;

political, but which afl'ected every side of economic life, since it was recognised
that wealth supplied the sinews of power. The whole economic skill of the day

was devoted to the task of building up the wealth of the nation as an independent

economic organism, that it might be able to hold its own in political disputes with

other countries.

                                      II.

The national scheme of economic policy is not so unfamiliar to us as the

municipal scheme which it superseded ; it is still pursued in many countries, and

it seems to me to dominate the present economic policy of the United States.

That great nation aims at being self-sufiicing, and at dispensing so far as possible

with the products and manufactures of other lands. This nationalist policy has

found an advocate in List, who has stated the case with wide practical knowledge

and careful discrimination of the circumstances of different peoples. But for

England and Englishmen that policy is dead. The Anti-Corn Law agitation killed
Weit so far as we are concerned .
                                      no longer contemplate isolation from the rest

of the globe ; we only grumble because other people interpose barriers which check
free commercial intercourse between all parts of the known world. The free-

traders have demonstrated that the world as a whole will be better provided with

it is particularly adapted, and caters for the rest of the world in these depart-

Wements.  have given up all idea that the nation should be self-sufficing; we

depend, even for the most necessary articles of subsistence, on communication with

other  countries                                       we produce with direct reference to                      the            requirements of foreign

markets, and do not merely export a surplus which we cannot advantageously use

--ourselves. So far as our economic scheme is concerned, we regard England aa

part of a greater whole not as an independent national organism, but as one

portion of a cosmopolitan economic organism ; we desire to have the freest com-

munication with all parts of the world, for on this our very life, our national pro-

sperity in all its branches, depends.

It seems to me, then, that just as there was a struggle in England between the

municipal scheme of economic life and the national one in the fourteenth and

fifteenth centuries, so there is in the present day a contest all the world over

between the nationalist economic policy on the one hand, and the international

and cosmopolitan scheme which we Englishmen have adopted for economic pur-

poses on the other. I have argued elsewhere ' that our commercial success has
been greatly due to the early date at which a national economic life was

developed in this country ; and I cannot regard it as a matter for regret that

we have been the first among the nations to throw ourselves heartily into the

cosmopolitan economic scheme.

It is a commonplace to say that we live in a period of transition ; of course

every period is in a sense a time of transition, for the world never does stand

absolutely still, but the change that is going on in the economic life of the world

to-day is something more                               than  common                                             the framework  on  which English  policy

was fashioned for three hundred years has been laid aside, and all our schemes for

industry and commerce are being devised on a new model and worked out on a
larger scale. This new model and larger growth are affecting all parts of the

globe, and even those countries which would fain pursue the old nationalist

economic scheme cannot escape the new influence international and cosmopolitan
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

economic forces are gradually breaking down national exclusiveness in all parts of
the known world.

   A(a) very few words will illustrate what I mean. There is in this country a

very large formation of capital every year. Mr. Wilson ^ traced it for the earher years

of this century, and Mr. Giflen has calculated it for more recent periods. The

capital thus formed seeks investment, and it is ready to flow into any channel
where there seems a reasonable chance of profit. It is not confined by national

barriers, but is transferred to any country, however distant or however uncivilised,

so long as arrangements are made that give a prospect of regular or of handsome
profits. The resources of distant colonies, of South American Republics, and of

Egypt, have been developed by capital borrowed in England. There are, therefore,
moneyed men in this country who have a stake, and are directly interested, in the
prosperity of many lands they have never seen. Space is ignored, patriotism is

left out of sight, and capital is invested wherever there is an apparent promise of

profit.

     (6) Capital tends too to minimise the differences between nations, since wher-
ever it goes it tends to modify the forms of industrial life. Capital introduces

new methods of production, for it brings machinery and thus induces the labourer
to spend his whole time in working for wages. There are still many lands where
the old system which was general in this country at the close of last century

holds good ; and where the artisan supports himself partly by labour on his land
and partly by his trade. But industrial capital, and expensive machinery, and
factory towns are not compatible with such conditions of life. As they are in-

troduced the old domestic system and the family life maintained by bye-occupations

are gradually broken up ; the artisan becomes wholly dependent on the wages he

earns and has no other source of income ; thus social life tends to shape itself in a

new form. As capital becomes a dominant force in industry, the artisan is induced

wliolly to relinquish agricultural pursuits, and society is separated into the two

great classes of capitalists who employ and labourers who earn wages. There

thus comes to be a class sympathy between wage-earners in many lands, such as

has never existed before in the history of                    the world                                                  their  difficulties are similar,
                                                                                                                      ;

their voting power is great, and their aspirations are alike ; with many of them

the interest of their own class in other lands calls forth more real sympathy than

the love of a country which is theirs in common with the classes who employ them.

The similarity of the conditions of employment in Western Europe was recognised

by the Emperor of Germany when he invited the representatives of various powers

to join in conference on the Labour problems. In the world of Labour, as in the

investment of capital, national difTerences and peculiarities are ceasing to be of

much importance.

(c) The most striking illustration of the decadence of nationalist economic

sentiment is to be found in contrastintr the attitude which is now taken by the

mother country towards the colonies with that which was constantly assumed

during the eighteenth century. The right of the Crown to tax the colonies was

frequently questioned or resisted, but the right to regulate the development of the

colony in the interest of the mother country may be said to have passed unchal-
lenged tiU the very eve of the War of Independence. In the present day, however,

"we are inclined to blame a government which does not administer its colonial

affairs solely in the interest of the colony itself and its inhabitants, without at-

tempting to render it economically subservient to the mother country any farther

than purely colonial considerations seem to demand. Our colonies give us prestige

and importance in all parts of the globe, they form a ring of settlements that are

English in language and habits and customs, but they ai-e not directly subservient

to our national economic interests, for they may encourage the commerce of foreign

countries and they may come to be our rivals in neutral markets.

(d) Nor is this all ; the international movements of labour are far more frequent

and rapid than they used to be. Till 1825, English artisans were positively for-

bidden to emigrate, either to our own colonies or to foreign parts ; it was doubtful
if engineers were at liberty to go abroad temporarily to set up machinery they had

"made. But the legal prohibition has been withdrawn, and the new facilities for

travel have entirely altered the habits of the labouring classes. There is, of course,

some little hesitation from differences of law and of language in foreign parts ; but
the Lancashire man who gets a good offer to go out as a foreman and organise a

spinning mill in Bombay is not likely to overestimate the importance of these
things. He has got a good opening and he will take his chance about his power

of making his orders understood.

(e) One consideration which helps to reconcile an Englishman to such a life

abroad is the frequency of intercommunication, together with the excellence of the

postal service all over the world. The very fact that there is such international
organisation is in itself a noticeable sign of the tendency of which I am speaking.

Postal communication between different parts of the world is far cheaper and

easier than it was between different parts of this country sixty years ago. National

barriers offer no practical resistance to the passage of news or the driving of

bargains ; mail steamers and telegi-aphs have combined to produce many changes

in the habits of business men in the present day.

     (/) One more illustration will suffice. For many articles there is now a world-
wide market, and it is possible to speculate with the view of engrossing the whole

available stock in the world, at any rate so as to be able to rule the market.

Corners in cotton may be looked for from time to time. Great trusts like the

Standard Oil Company monopolise an article of common consumption, and a

Copper Syndicate has run its course. The questions whether such speculations

are likely to be profitable or not, and whether they are public dangers, do not

concern  us  now                          I  merely wish  to  point  out  that                                           in  actual  commerce  in  the
                                       ;

present day we find what may be termed cosmopolitan speculation, which disregards

all national differences and takes account of the world as a whole.

These symptoms that economic life in the present day is breaking down national

tarriers and forming international connections of every kind are very interesting.

I know tliat they are not the only features of our time ; there is a revival of
national sentiment in many quarters, and national aspirations, if they are more

than the idlest sentimentality, involve a desire to create economic life that is

national too ; in many lands there are increasing attempts to protect native in-

dustry. The Nationalists of 1784 were enthusiasts for stimulating native industry

in Ireland, and for prohibiting the importation of British goods : and the prospects

of protection do not seem to daunt the advocates of Home Rule to-day. Nationalism

cannot but be a living power in an age which has seen the union of Italy and the

formation of the German Empire. I do not ignore these facts though I lay stress

on another side, and say that, so far as industrial life is concerned, it is, on the

whole, becoming more and more cosmopolitan and international, and less and

Weless fettered by national barriers all over the world.  in England have for

good or for evil committed ourselves to the cosmopolitan scheme, and have definitely

.and deliberately discarded the nationalist system.

                                                                                III.

      1. This striking change in economic life and commercial practice must, one
would suppose, be reflected sooner or later in economic doctrine. Of course it

cannot be felt all at once ; economists, like other men of science, can only observe
what has actually occurred and reflect upon it. The science grows as new forms
of industrial and commercial life appear, and demand that they shall be taken into
account. But we can at least see the manner in which modification must come
into the science as conceived by Mill; in accordance with these new phenomena we
shall have to entertain additional hypotheses about human nature and human
institutions. The whole science is, as everyone now seems to agree, hypothetical.*
The method which Ricardo pursued and Mill formulated has been generally adopted
by English economists, and they are ready to admit that all their results rest on
certain assumptions in regard to the physical world and human nature. But while
the facts of physical nature may on tlie whole be regarded as constant for the period
of human life on the globe, the historian knows that it is not so with the facts of
human nature; human institutions, and the characters which are formed by them

are modified from age to age ; if ive ivisk to study the economic condition of any
actual people at any time, we 7nmt xcork with conceptt07is that are appropriate to

--their habits of life. To Mill it seemed sufficient to assume a single type of

human nature one in which self-interest predominated ; and one kind of society
where free competition was usual ; all other economic phenomena he dismissed as
unsusceptible of scientific treatment. But we do not alter the logical form or

change the scientific character of our study if, instead of framing a single hypothesis

in regard to human nature and society, and restricting our attention to such
phenomena as can be convenientlj' studied in connection with it, we are pre-
pared to investigate all economic phenomena by making such assumptions in
regard to men as are appropriate to the various ages with which we may have to
deal. Professor Edgeworth has rightly pointed out that economists often blunder
in treating something as constant that is really variable,^ and I should like to add
that the most common illustration of this error may be found in arguments which
seem to assume that human nature is a constant,' and that the variations, even in
long periods, may be neglected. Such is the discussion of the applicability of

Ricardo's law, vdth all it involves,* to rents, several centuries ago ; but perhaps

this is meant as a sort of scientific witticism ; it is not always easy to tell when
a Professor of the dismal science is making a joke.

    Pardon me if I dwell on this point with some iteration ; in all economic study
hypothesis is necessary ; it is only by stating some hypothesis that we can artificially

isolate a group of facts, and thua give a clear explanation of a portion of the com-

plicated phenomena which go to make up human society ; only hy carefully stating-
our hypotheses can we avoid the dogmatism with which economists are so often

charged ; since by putting forward tlie condition we assume, we are also stating

the hmits within which our conclusions hold good. In reasoning from assumed
premisses we may obtain conclusions that have demonstrative certainty and state

laws which have universal validity ' in any sphere we can think about, even if

there is no place or time where the conditions on which they depend are realised,

so that these laws have nothing corresponding to them in any actual existence.
Our results may have no material truth, even though they have universal validity.

The pursuit of such speculations may be most valuable as a mental discipline, if for
no other reason because they may assist us to see how many matters must be taken
into consideration if we wish to make our investigations of actual phenomena

exhaustive. But if we are careful that our hypotheses about human nature shall

not be arbitrary, but shall have as much appropriateness as possible to actual men
and women in some actual place at some actual time, we get conclusions that are

not only universally valid in form, but that also serve to be a convenient instru-

Wement for investigating facts.                                            may assume that people are grouped in nations,

and that each individual acts out of pure self-interest ; or we may assume that

people are grouped in families, and always act from a sense of duty in adhering to

known  customs                                           in  either  case  we  can  state  laws  that  have  universal  validity

on the assumed conditions ; but for purposes of empirical investigation, one

hypothesis is more convenient for studying the actual facts in Western Europe,

and the other is more convenient for studying the actual facts on the Russian

Steppes ; they are not equally appropriate to both groups of economic phenomena.

    As Dr. Wliewell pointed out in excellent terms,- the progress of empirical

science demands the employment of appropriate conceptions ; but an illustration

may enforce this necessity in regard to economic investigation. Some little time

ago I was anxious to get a few statistics about the growth of British shipping

during: last century, and I turned to the beautiful ' Statistical Atlas' which was

published by William Playfair, who first applied the graphic method to statistics.
But I found that his careful diagrams were useless for my purpose, and I think I
may add for any possible purpose. He has arranged all his facts with the view of

showing in the clearest manner how the balance of trade stood between Great

Britain and each of the other countries with which we had commercial dealings,

and he thus demonstrated whether any branch was a losing or a gaining trade.

At the time when he wrote the unwisdom of this way of looking at things had

been clearly exposed, but he had failed to move with the times, and the work on

which he spent so much labour was simply thrown away. He only serves as

a warning to other economists, lest by adhering rigidly to habits of thought which

have ceased to be appropriate to the changing conditions of industry and commerce

their investigations and reflections should be out of touch with actual life, and

should all too soon find their place in the limbo of misapplied erudition.

    (a) To my mind the cosmopolitan and international character of industry and

commerce has not yet been sufficiently taken into account by economists. They

inherit the conception of mankind as grouped for economic purposes in nations, and

they adhere to it very closely. Adam Smith did much to break the old spell and

to show that it was not worth wbile to try and build up an independent national

economic life, but be was still under the thraldom of the old phrases. He still

spoke of the Wealth of Nations, and treated the nation as the economic unit.

List ' does indeed speak of Adam Smith as concerned with a world-wide economy,

--but this is hardly correct ; he describes, not a cosmopolitan system, but economic

principles that would serve for any nation they are nationalist still. Cobden and

the Free Traders took the same standpoint ; they thought of the nation as an
economic whole; they hoped that unin peded intercourse would bring about more

friendly feeling between nations ; they anticipated a great brotherhood in which

each nation should be a !member ; but Cobden was intensely nationalist and in-

tensely patriotic.^ The intercourse has come about, but it has not drawn nations

more closely together as nations: it has drawn the elements which composed

separate nations into new relationships so as to form cosmopolitan ties and inter-

ests, and to break down national barriers and weaken national sentiments. Neither
the political economy of Adam Smith nor the political economy of Richard Cob-

den took much account of the cosmopolitan character of economic life ; it has
sprung up since their time, but I think that we ought to take account of it, and to

make sure that the fundamental conceptions of our science are appropriate to the

Weindustrial and commercial phenomena of the present day.  need to think

more of the world as a whole ; for the practical economic interests of the present

are no longer so exclusively national as they used to be. The nation will doubtless
continue to have great importance for many economic purposes, just as imder the

nationalist regime municipalities have been useful organisations, which have at

present an increasing importance. But the reality of the change is most obvious

when werpmember the diminished importance of national prosperity with refei-ence

to the sources of taxation. In days when national prosperity was the recognised

basis of national power. Parliament desired to increase the ' funds ' from which it could

draw for the expenses of the realm. For this purpose the limits of the nation have

ceased to be of exclusive importance. Capital flows into all lands, and the income

returns to London, and the Income Tax Commissioners collect their quota with

remorseless impartiality. English capital invested in the United States pays in-

come tax in just the same way as capital invested here; the maintenance of the
national revenue is, to some extent, dissociated from the development of our own

national resources or the material prosperity of our own realm ; this is a curious
phenomenon of modern life which was first clearly brought out, as I believe, by
Sir Charles Wood in his Budget speech^ of 1847. The decreasing importance of

national prosperity for political purposes presents an analogy with the decline of

municipal economy. In old days the townsmen had been bound together by their

obligations to contribute to the royal exchequer ; it was this that united the

municipalities into a single body for economic purposes ; their decline coincided

with the development of a national system of taxation, which in turn called forth

a system of fostering the national sources of wealth. There was a great advance

in economic doctrine in the fourteentli century when it was losing its old form
and men began to deal with national and not merely with civic interests, and it

seems to me that we might do well to let national wealth take a subordinate place

in our economic discussions, and to frame our inquiries with direct reference to the

bearing of economic changes on the world as a whole.

{b) At all events the assumption in regard to individual human nature, which

is explicitly or implicitly made in current economic treatises, requires to be recon-

sidered. The isolated individual, who acts out of self-interest, still holds a promi-

nent place in economics, implicitly at least ; for we still hear about the measurement

of motives which act on the individual will as if they were the sole object of

scientific economic study, not merely a single though an important factor. Motives

which affect the collective will of an association act in a different plane and can-

not be easily co-ordinated with the others ; the individual self-interest of the work-

man and the collective interest of the trade-union to which he belongs often

conflict, and most economists have found it convenient to leave these associated

and corporate movements in the background and to justify themselves for concen-

trating attention on individualist motives by the assertion that ' now, as ever, the

main body of movement depends on the deep, silent, strong stream of the tendencies

of normal distribution and exchange.' It is, of course, the simplest assumption

to make, and for short periods in recent times it may be sufficiently satisfactory
but there is a danger of falling into grave error if we rely on this assumption

for simplicity's sake and take individual earnings to gauge the labourer's standard

of comfort in different centuries of English history.^ It is not difficidt to general-

ise from the past so as to make it appear that this mode of treatment, by isolating

the individual, is less inappropriate now than it has been in some earlier ages

that may he granted at once; individualism, like nationalism, will doubtless be an
important economic category for many purposes, but who shall say that it is even
as widely appropriate in England now as it was sixt}' years ago, when the tide of
legislation was dominated by laissez faire and the ComJaiuation Laws were repealed ?

Is it so dominant in these days of capitalist trusts and labour leagues as to be

the most appropriate conception with which to study all economic phenomena in

our own country in the present day ?
     One disadvantage about this mode of treatment is that we really know so little

about the isolated individual and his manner of dealing with other isolated in-

dividuals the mere statement brings out the difficulty. Our assumptions regarding
                                                   ;

such human nature could only be a satisfactory basis for argument if they tallied

with observations made in a large number of instances, so as to form the ba.sis for
a valid induction like the great argument of Malthus in his Essay. As Mr.

Keynes has admirably pointed out, the value of the deductive method as a means

of studying actual economic phenomena depends on the inductive determination of

premisses.' But in regard to the unfettered action of individuals there can be no

fiuch induction, for there are no cases to observe. If we wish to state abstract
principles of individual human action, we are forced to fall back on another method

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

to take a type of human nature and analyse it ; and it is on this line that econo-
mists proceed in framing their fundamental assumption about individual human
nature. Bentliam many years ago attempted to analyse the motives which may
be brought to bear upon a man and reduced them all to quantities of pleasure and

pain. Thirty years have elapsed since Mill demonstrated the insufficiency of this

analysis and showed that we must take qualitative as well as quantitative

difl'erences into account ; - and in economics it is specially necessary to attend to

qualitative distinctions. It is far less important to measure the force of self-interest

than to distinguish the cases where self-interest coincides with family welfare and

national prosperity, and those where it does not. Here, if anywhere, it is essential
that we should keep abreast of the times, and recognise the importance of qualita-

tive as well as quantitative distinctions in discussing the motives which influence

men in their material concerns. But some recent economists seem satisfied that a

defective analysis is good enough for them ; the crude method which Bentham

suggested has  been adopted  by  Jevons ^                                   the  quantitative  analysis  of  individual
                                                                         ;

motives is spoken of as if it were the principal work of an economist ; writers still

discuss quanta of pleasure and pain, of utility and disutility ; and the individual, as
Bentham analysed him, is still a fundamental conception in current economic

treatises. ' Put a pennj' in the slot and the model will work.' Society is too

frequently regarded as an aggregate of similar individuals, whose actions can all be

represented with sufficient accuracy by the Benthamite analysis of motives. Such

a conception of societj^ is surely out of date to-day.

    Very fruitful resiilts have certainly' been obtained bj' those economists who
have not busied themselves about measuring supposititious motives, and who do

not assume that man is an isolated self-interested individual. Frederic Le Play

regards the family as the most convenient unit for economic observations, both in

the advanced and the primitive societies; he has distinguished the different types

of family, and their social importance, with rare acuteness; and he has set forth

with admirable judgment their respective characters as elements in society.

Though too little known in England, his work does not stand alone ; for Mr,

C^harles Booth's monumental investigation into the condition of the dwellers in

East London is based on a number of investigations in regard to the circumstances
·of families. In the family there is a natural social and economic unit which was

of much actual importance before English municipalities arose, and before English

national life asserted itself in economic affairs. The family is a natural unit

which is destined to survive even if our national industry and commerce are more

and more merged in cosmopolitan and international progress.

current economic science, as very imperfectly appropriate to the actual conditions

of industry and commerce to-day, I fear I may be charged with misrepresenting
the work of recent economists. To this charge I am ready to plead guilty at once

I think it very likely I liave misrepresented them, and I am extremely sorry for it,

--for I have not done it carelessly or deliberately -I have sedulously endeavoured to

avoid it. The fault lies not with me, but with writers who, when they leave their

studies and translate their formulie into the language of common life, forget that

they have to do with stupid people they claim a liberty to alter their definitions
                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

from time to time as the e.xigencies of their argument shall require, and they do

not take sufficient pains to state clearly and fully what their assumptions are.

Despite my best endeavours I may not always succeed in following them and

reconciling their apparent inconsistencies. Ricardo, as Professor Marshall excel-

lently says,' made ' the great error of taking for granted that his readers would supply
those conditions that were present to his own mind.' ' He changes from one
hypothesis to another without giving notice.' And this brings me to the second

point on which an historian may be inclined to insist : that since human nature and

institutions chanxje so much, it is most important that our hypotheses regarding

them should be stated fidly and clearly. Unless we do so we are not able to keep

quite clearly before us the limits within which our arguments are applicable to-

actual life ; but when our hypotheses are clearly stated, we can see directly how
far our reasoning is irrelevant to some past condition of society, or how far it would

become inapplicable if human nature were to change for the better. Just because

economic reasoning is hypothetical and the results are universal in form, hasty

readers are apt to forget the comparatively narrow area and short time of actual

life to which any single hypothesis is really appropri.ite, and the limits within

which economic generalisations are approximately true ; there is a constant

tendency to the undue extension of principles that have universal validity, as if

they had therefore a wide range of applicability. By clearly stating our hypotheses,

we may secure all the advantages which accrue from modern economic science and

push the refinements of theory much farther, while we shall keep well before us the

hypothetical character and limited applicability of our conclusions, so that we-

need fear no apparent conflict either with the facts furnished by history or with

the ideals which moralists may be endeavouring to realise.

Ricardo, Senior, and some of those who have followed them, have not been

careful to state exactly what they assumed. This neglect was often verj' excusable

in Ricardo, especially when he assumed things that were prominent and well-

known features in the economic conditions of his day. He did not feel called upon

to state some assumption, because it was so clear to common sense that it did not

seem worth while to put it on paper. But if there is any lesson that history

teaches us, it is that nothing is so well known that we can assume it

will always be well known and does not need to be explained. William

the Conqueror framed an elaborate scheme for the taxation of England, and

recorded the results in ' Domesday Book.' He said that every place was to

pay according to hides. This place was rated at so many hides and that other at
80 many more or less. But what was a hide ? He did not think it necessary to

state that, because it was obviously a thing that everybody knew ; in the course
of time it came to be a thing that everybody had forgotten, and the precise mean-

ing of which is being gradually recovered. But William the Conqueror could

hardly be expected to foresee all that, or to know that, in the interests of historical

research, he ought to have given a plain definition of the everyday language

which he used.

In much the same way Ricardo could not be expected to foresee that within

half a century after he wrote there would be an extraordinary agricultural revo-

lution                                he  lived before  the  days  of thorough  draining, when  high  farming  was
                                   ;

still in an experimental stage ; in his time English agriculture was still mainly

extensive. If prices promised well the farmer would plough more ground and

bring a larger area under crop ; if prices ruled low the worst land would go out of
cultivation. There were many fields which were actually on the margin of

                                                             ' Principles, 213, 530.

·cultivation, and were left waste after the fall of prices in 1816. Ricardo and

Ricardo's readers would have the clearest picture before them of the agricultural

conditions he assumed when his 'Principles' were published in 1817. It is said

that his theory of rent does not apply, without modification, to new countries

which have been developed since he wrote, or to old conditions of society of which

he was unaware, or to the highly intensive farming that has been developed since

he died. Very likely it does not ; it would be very odd if it did ; surely a man
may get the credit of giving an admirable explanation of the facts before him even

if tlie terms he used do not directly apply to facts which were about to come into
being subsequently. As his reasoning is hypothetical it has universal validity in

form, but Ricardo was far too good a logician to suppose that it therefore had

general applicability to all places and times. If he had only stated the

--conditions he assumed conditions which were obvious to him and might be easily
--discerned by us if we chose the value of his explanation, and the limits within

which it is true, would have been clear.

     Somewhat similar and similarly excusable carelessness was shown by those

economists among whom the doctrine of a wages fund grew up.- They did not

define it as fixed, but they thought and argued about it as though it was fixed

owing to the actual circumstances of their times which they implicitly assumed.

So far as real wages are concerned and the available ' fund ' of the necessaries of

life, this was restricted by the operation of the Corn Laws : it could not be easily

increased as a matter of fact. So far as money payments for labour were con-

cerned, the additional outlay which the capitalist was prepared to make for

wages was also closely restricted in the great trades of the country. In the

textile trades machinery was being introduced but slowly ; the contest between

hand-combing and machine-combing had still to be fought, and the power loom

was beginning to be a practical success, not only in cotton weaving, but in the

ancient and staple trades of the country. The expense of machine weaving could

be definitely calculated, and if the expense of production by paying hand labour

came up to it then the power loom would be introduced, and the weavers thrown

out of employment, in so far as they were not needed to mind the machines. The

expense of the machine production of a given quantity of cloth was a ' wages fund.'

This wages fund was practically fixed, and was divided between the large numbers

who applied for employment, and among whom the work was ' spread out.' We

may be thankful that these conditions have passed away, but we need not denounce

those who formulated a theory of wages, which was on the whole applicable to

the times in which they lived, because these times have changed, and it is no

longer so applicable to ours. The great English economists of the early part of

this century gave excellent explanations of the industrial phenomena with which
-- --they were familiar their error
                                                                                                               ;,
and a very excusable error                                                                                         lay in not stating the

conditions they assumed, and thus indicating the limits within which their

doctrine could be considered to hold good.

      I fear I have occupied a long time in saying very little yet it is not un-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

science if we try to make sure, at least for ourselves, that we know what we are

talking about. It is well to be clear how far we are dealing with reasonings that

have a merely formal validity and universality, and how far with the phenomena

of the world we live in. If we are to pi'eserve and develop economics on all its

sides, both as a formal science which deals with the relations between economic

imits of all kiuds, and as an instrument for investigating actual facts and under-

standing them better, then we must be careful to see that our hypotheses are

appropriate to the actual conditions of life and most anxious in our endeavour to

state fullv the conditions we assume.

      The following Papers were read :

  --1. Labour and Capital. Their Differences and how to Reconcile them.

                                    By C. H. Perkins.

     The appointment of a Royal Commission for the purpose of inquiry into the
causes of the constantly occurrin;^ disputes between Labour and Capital, is an
additional proof of the extreme gravity of the question.

     The results of that inquiry it would be unwise to predict. That much valuable
 information will be obtained there is no doubt, but it will afterwards rest with
practical men to use that information to advantage and in furtherance of the
 objects in view. Thus, even while the Commission is sitting, there is ample
 scope and a most useful field for thought and inquiry.

      The causes that have produced the present state of things are readily to be
 understood. Employers, as a rule, and very naturally, have sought to secure labour
at the lowest possible cost ; and so long as they held absolutely the upper hand,
disputes could not long continue, and there would be no impediment to the progress
of the country in wealth, industry,andcommerce, however much the philanthropist,
and indeed the political economist, might have reason to deplore the subservience
of the working classes and their deprivation of much of the true enjoyments and
happiness of life.

     But now an enormous alteration has taken place, through the spread of educa-
tion, a cheap press, ready and cheap means for emigration, and the power of com-
bination by means of trade and other unions.

      Thus the forces of labour and capital are equalised, and strikes and disputes
have become protracted and dangerous, and the necessity of some mode of identify-
ing the respective interests of labour and capital, and of promptly settling disputes
when they do arise, is rendered absolutely necessary.

     While much has been said and written as to the identity of the interests of
labour and capital, it is apparent that capital has in some respects a preferential
claim. Such claim includes interest for its use and its eventual return to the

investor.

     The power to labour is, on the other hand, the workman's capital, and for its
use he is entitled to wages at current i-ates, and, as that power is an exhaustive one,
its possessor should be recouped, so far as possible, for its expenditure.

     But as regards capital, the money invested can only, as a rule, be refunded if
success attends the undertaking in which it is embarked, while the workman,
after receiving wages at current rates, can, if he likes, remove to other scenes of
labour, and thus incurs no risk of loss beyond the expenditure of a certain amount

of his physical strength.

      Before, therefore, profits can be regarded as having been attained, interest at a
rate depending upon the nature of the undertaking must be paid, and also a certain
annual sum, or a percentage on the profits, for redemption of capital.

     These preferential claims being provided for, it is proposed that all further
profits or income be divided between capital and labour in the proportion that the
amount invested and employed as working capital bears to the collective amount
paid annually in wages.

     Thus, presuming a colliery, for example, has cost and employs capital to the
extent of 20,000/. and that the interest is 5 per cent., and the charge for redemp-

tion 2^ per cent., 1,500/. per annum out of the profits would thus be paid to the
investors. Presuming that the annual profits were 5,200/., there would be a

residue of 3,700/. for division between capital and labour. If the latter, as repre-
sented by the wages paid, amounted to 20,000/., half of this residue of 3,700/., that
is, 1,850/., would accrue to labour and half to capital. Thus, presuming a man's
annual earnings amounted to 6G/. he would receive a bonus of 5/. 18s. Sd. per
annum.

    Capital would really lose nothing by this apparent surrender, for it would first
receive interest at fair rates and redemption, and secondly the immunity from
strikes and stoppages ; and the additional care and economy that would be shown
--736 EEPOET 1891.

hj the workmen would probably more than make up for the amount paid to

them.

     In all these co-operative undertakings the workmen would be invited to select
three or more of their body to act as ' "Workmen's Directors,' and consult with the
employers upon all matters connected with the 2vork and wages of the undertaking.
In this way careful supervision would be exerted, and bad and careless workmen

speedily got rid of.

     To establish this system it is necessary that it receive official recognition. The
men will not believe in it if it merely appears as a gift on the part of the

employers.
     Thus it is necessary that registration offices should be established by Government

in convenient localities, where these co-operative undertakings would be registered,
the main particulars as to capital, interest, &c., being stated, and each half-year
the amount paid in wages and the profits made. Attached to each registration
office there would be commissioners, men of known standing in their respective
districts, and these would form a Board of Appeal to which any labour disputes
that might arise could be referred.

     The importance and advantage of such a Board cannot be overestimated..
Disputes that now ripen mto long and protracted strikes would be settled at once
and great loss prevented.

      It is appropriate that this scheme should be considered in the great theatre of
labour where the British Association this year meets for the prosecution of the
great and beneficent objects that it so powerfully advances.

        2. On the Goal Question. By T. Forster Brown, M.Inst.G.E.

     After referrinsT to various writers on the subject, the writer proceeded to discuss
the probable duration of our total coal resources.

     This depends upon whether the ratio of increase in production will continue to
ascend or diminish.

      It will probably be a decreasing ratio for the following reasons :
     1. The population of the country is increasing in a diminishing ratio.
     2. The earlier developed coalfields already show a retarded rate of output.
      3. The working of thinner seams will further reduce the output capacity.

     This would make it appear that the total exhaustion of coal, if the Report of the
Royal Commission of 1871 is to be relied upon, is in no way imminent; but, as the
coal is worked in thinner seams and greater depth, the cost of producing it, after a

 certain period, will begin probably to steadily increase.
      The writer exemplified the retarded rate of output of the earlier coalfields.

     The maximum output may probably be reached in twenty-five years, and
continue for another twenty-five years. After this period a new element in the

 commercial position of the nation, viz., the greatly enhanced cost of fuel, will
 commence to be felt.

      This increased cost will be partially obviated for a time by reduction in the rate
 of wages, and of prices for materials, as well as in royalties and other charges, but

it will be impossible to maintain the cost of production at the present limits. As

 the expansion of our industries is absolutely dependent on a low range in the cost
 of fuel, the effect of an increased cost will begin to manifest itself, and will operate
 first of all on our carrying trade.

     We are now able to export large quantities of coal, which acts as ballast,

 receiving in return all, or nearly all, the raw material required for our manufac-
 tures, as well as a large proportion of our food supplies, at low freights. With
coal at an increased price, we shall have to pay a higher price for our raw material,
 and this, with the increased cost for steam, must raise the cost of producing our
 manufactured goods, and limit our power of competing with other countries, lead-
 ing to a continuance of bad trade, with shorter intervals of prosperity, to the
 transfer of much of our capital and investments abroad, the loss of that which
 remains, and to the lowering of wages and the emigration of the best of tha-
 working classes.

      Present imporlance of our industries illustrated by statistics.
     The mere loss of capital, thoug-h serious, will not be of prime importance to
future generations, but outlay, for the redemption of which no provision has been
made during the period of continuous prosperity, and on which interest must be
paid, will be a crushing burden.
      This will especially apply to

                                      1. The National Debt.
                                       2. Our railways and doclvs.
                                      3. Our municipal debts.
                                      4. Our water and lighting works.

     The interest upon this capital, with continued bad trade, must inevitably ulti-
mately lead to national bankruptcy, and probably fundamental social changes,

unless the capital is paid oft".
     It is o])Yiously the duty of this, and the next, generation to devise means, if

possible, of repaying the great e.xpenditure incurred in the development of our
resources; before these exceptional resources are e.xhausted the expenditure would
never have been necessary in a purely agricultural country or in a country in which
the coal resources were inferior in quality or costly to work.

                                                         Memedy.

     The writer suggests that the remedy is the acquirement by the State of the
railways, docks, municipal and other loans, and of all lighting and water works,
and the liquidation of the National Debt.

    By this means the cost of carriage of coal, of passengers, and goods, could ulti-

mately bo reduced to the mere cost of maintenance and working, the total amount
of the purchase by the State being gradually extinguished by the operation of a

sinking-fund.

    The total charge for the National Debt is at the present moment 25,000,OOOZ.; the
profits on railways, docks, and canals are about 30,817,000Z. per annum, and should
it be possible to purchase for the nation all the above, and to extinguish the capital
by the operation of a sinking fund, the total gain to the nation would ultimately
be 60,000,000^. per annum. This sum would cover a very large increa-ed cost in
the price of coal, and go a great way towards enabling the nation to maintain its
commercial position, so long as our coal resources endure.

     The paper further discussed the probable mode in which the nation could
acquire the railways without involving a large annual outlay, and winds up with
Pome general observations upon the whole question, and points out that the time
lias arrived when the subject requires serious legislative investigation.

1             ' Miners'  Thrift  and  Employers'  Liabilitij :  a  RemarJcahle  Experience.*
           .

              By George L. Campbell, Secretary of the Central Association for

              Eealing with Distress caused by Mininrj Accidents.

              The thrift dealt with in Mr. Campbell's paper was that embodied in the

system of miners' permanent societies, which was commenced about thirty years

ago in the north of England, and has steadily grown until it now represents the

chief voluntary endeavour to meet the distress arising from the dangerous vocation

of mining. The liability of employers was chiefly that set up by the Employers'

Liability Act of 1880 ; and the principal question submitted to the section was as

to the desirableness on grounds of public policy of legislation suggested for the

Durpose of hindering miners and their eniplovers entering into arrangements

              1891.                                                             3b

·whereby, in view of the existing law, they jointly provide against all the casualties

incidental to their trade. The words, ' contracting out of the Act,' were advisedly
set aside as not representing fairly the arrangements now prevailing, and it was

contended that the existing contracts are in view of the Act, and are the result of

legislation rather than an attempt to evade its provisions. The history of colliery

clubs having been lightly touched upon, the paper set out the progress of the

movement for establishing permanent funds, one of whose chief objects is to

remove the anomaly as to fatal accidents, whereby when men were killed in large

numbers subscriptions provided for their dependents, but when men died singly

Whenthere was no attempt to elicit public hel]i.  representatives of the societies

met in conference for the first time in 1878, the total membership was 00,000, and

a central association was formed, at whose conference this year (1891) were repre-

sented societies with an aggregate membership of 268,971 ; with a revenue of

242,658/. ; with accumulated funds amounting to 367,293/. ; with 2,395 widows

and 3,842 children in receipt of allowances, and having in the year 1890 dealt

with 39,411 cases of disability through accident. The increase of membership

from 1889 to 1890 was over 30,000. Mr. Campbell proceeded to show what had

been done in view of the Employers" Liability Act in the coalfields having perma-

nent societies, and it appeared that at Decembei", 1890, there were 110,973 of the

members of the permanent societies under arrangement with tbeir employers, the

general principle being that the masters contributed 25 per cent, on the con-

tributions of the men. The ' remarkable experience ' referred to in the

title of the paper had special reference to Monmouthshire and South "Wales,
where the society was formed after the Act of 1880 was passed. It was now

second in point of numbers of the permanent societies, and had 52,760 members.

Add to these 12,978 members of the North Wales society, the 44,824 of Lancashire

--and Cheshire, and a small contingent of Xorth Staffordshire, and then let the

question be squarely put was it possible that, in view of the powerful agitation

maintained in and out of Parliament since 1880, these 110,973 men could have

been forced into an arrangement or by force could be kept under an arrangement

with their employers ? No more than the}^ could coerce a nation could they

coerce 110,000 men who stood almost shoulder to shoulder from Cumberland to

Cornwall, and who had shrewdly made the Act of 1880 the means of making

--provision for all accidents not only those for which the employer is legally

responsible and those caused by the workman's inadvertence, but for that great

proportion of disasters for which neither masters nor men could be held account-

able. Elaborate statistics were appended to the paper, from which Mr. Campbell

said it would not be difficult to ascertain how much bad lieen lost to the sufferers

from accident in the mining community by reason of there not being general

combination between masters and men for their mutual insurance and benefit.

The tables of figures answered the question whether monetary considerations

hindered safe management ; and especially was this the case as to North Wales,

where, with a most compact organisation of employers and employed in view of

the Act, there had since its passing been a steady reduction in the number of

accidents. It was contended that the miners' permanent societies ought not to be

disturbed, and that, while the Legislature shoidd be encouraged to make the Act

of 1880 permanent and to prohibit contracts based alone on consideration of

employment, contracts should be permitted and encouraged which made provision

for all accidents as sufficient as the Act gave in cases where the employers were

liable. The risk was an insurable one, and the Legislature were not likely to

hinder a man insuring against an insurable risk ; nor was it reasonable to say that
while it might be covered by a proprietary company it ought not to be available

business for a concern in which the parties interested were proprietors with the

profits returned to them. Since the select committee of 1886 received evidence

the number of contracts in view of the Act had increased by no less than 38,000

in mining alone. Every year strengthened the position of those who contend that

in this matter freedom of contract should be maintained, coupled with reasonable

security against the workmen being placed at a disadvantage ; and the object of

the paper would be served if it assisted in maturing public opinion in the direction
TEANSACXIONS OF SECTION F.       739

of hindering the Legislature striking a severe blow at a system of thrift which had
admirably served its purpose, and which, by reason of its excellent work among a
class who suffer greatly for the public good, had strong claim for consideration at

the hands of the nation at large.

2. State Provision against Sickness and Old Age, and the German Inva-
               lidity and Superanmmtion Law. By LouiS Ttlor.

    The writer proposed to present the German law in an English dress and draw
a slight sketch of what would be the experience of English workpeople were we
to adopt the principle of State insurance in our own way of doing things by com-
bining officialism with voluntaryism in much the same way as we have already
dealt with education and military service. Among the proposed modifications of
the German sj'stem are the adoption in England of a uniform standard of relief, in
place of the fourfold classification according to wages which prevails in Germany,
and the substitution of sixty-five years for seventy years as the limit of super-
annuation. Other readjustments are enumerated under several heads. The
total cost of the scheme is estimated at Is. Sd. per week, which the writer
apportions between employers and employed. Further information has increased

the estimate to Is. 5d. per week.

3. On Some Economic Aspects of Life Assurance. By John M. McCandlish,

      F.B.S.E., formerly President of the Faculty of Actuaries in Scotland.

     After referring to the growing interest of the public in this subject and to the

fact that to Life Assurance are due the existence and the security of tens of thou-
sands of families, the author defined Life Assurance as being, like Fire or Marine
or Accident Insurance, a means of mitigating the pecuniary loss arising from an

accident by distributing it among the many who are liable to the like accident,
the accident in this case being that of premature death. The paper proceeded to
.show among other things that legitimate life insurance was the antithesis of
gambling, and that the real gambler is he who refuses or delays to insure his life

when he has no other means of providing for his family ; while Insurance Institu-
tions or Governments or ^lunicipal Bodies gamble if they conduct insurance or
annuity schemes on unsound principles. It was needful also to recognise that the
advantages of life assurance must be paid for, and that while every man gets what
he has paid for, namely, protection against loss to his family in case of his prema-
ture death, in another sense the advantage to the families of those who die soon
must be paid for by those who live long. And in the case of annuities the advan-
tages to those who live long must be pa id for by those who die soon.

     The paper dealt with the question to which Canon Blackley, and more lately

--Mr. Chamberlain, have invited attention of how ' the masses ' can be induced or

compelled or assisted to provide for their own old age, so as to escape the degra-
dation of pauperism and relieve the country of the cost of it. It was shown that
by an extension and a popularising of the existing arrangements by which Govern-
ment sells deferred annuities it might be made easy for almost every member of
the so-called ' working-classes ' to secure by means of payments well within his
power, and extending over a limited number of years, a sufficient income for him-
self in old age. It was recommended that the necessary facilities .should be given
and a staff of men employed to promote the scheme, leaving it for future consider-

ation whether any form of compulsion, as has been proposed, or any further
inducements should be used to ensure its universal adoption. It was pointed out
at the same time that any large contribution out of public funds towards this
object, unless it could be shown to be for the benefit of taxpayers universally,

would be simply an arbitrary transfer of money from the pockets of those who

would derive no advantage from the scheme to the pockets of other people.

       4. The Survival of Domestic Industries. By Professor Gonner.

    The complaints at the time of the depression of home industries and their
suspension by the factory system lay stress on four main points. 1. Machinery
and steam power, 2. Currency changes and taxation. 3. Foreign competition.
4. Irregularities. These grievances exemplified from the Reports of Royal Com-
missions and Select Committees of the House of Commons. On analysis the chief
causes of the change in mode of employment may be deduced from these. They

are:

     (a) The effect of machinery.
     (b) The economy of labour in the factory.
     (c) The need of some centralised system of manufacture to counteract irregu-
larity and imcertainty of demand. This owing to what may be termed the de-
localisation of demand.
     Importance of these two latter as showing that the tendency to change existed
before, though it was much accelerated by the introduction of great mechanical
appliances and the use of steam-power. Continuing the investigation it is necessary
to observe separately the effect of the two systems (home industries and factories)
on (a) the work produced, (h) the condition of the workers.
     I. Industries in which the work is largely affected or which allow of factory
organisation. Some other industries, viz., those requiring regular work and not
demanding any unusual degree of skill, may be included with these. "Where
machinery can be used, the work produced by its aid is cheaper and often better.
The condition of the workers in these trades does not seem to have deteriorated on
their employment in factories. Reasons for this. The instance of the hosiery
trade and the nail- and chain-workers in the midland counties.
     II. Industries in which the three main causes of change are less operative.
These may be divided into three classes
     Cff) Industries requiring individual artistic skill or in which the commodities
produced require adaptation, e.<j. carving, hand-lace making, brass-working, &c.,
of first kind ; and of second, bespoke clothes trade, &c.
     {h) Supplementary trades where a large portion of the labour is given by those
who, by reason of domestic duties, &c., cannot or are most unwilling to work in
factories, e.r/. straw-plaiting, lace-making, &c.
     (c) Local industries, where the demand is local and the industry local, e.g.
crab-pot making, &c.
     In some instances of the two former of these classes a tendency to factory
organisation exists owing to the action of the third cause (see above c) and of a
fourth cause (rf), viz. the desire to restrict competition by combination.

   --Conclusion. Thcneed of further investigation. Its importance.

                       5. Free Travel. By S. 1.1. Burroughs.

     That it would be desirable to have railways throughout the country as free for
use by the public as lifts or elevators in hotels are free for the use of the guests,
there is no doubt. The only difficulty which arises in making them so is the con-
struction and management of railways, which is a very costly enterprise.

     The arguments in favour of free travel are numerous, and apparently un-
answerable. It would relieve congestion in towns, it would greatly assist tlie
commerce and industry of the country, would create a greater demand for labour,
and so advance wages and the social well-being of the people, and at the same time
tend to a great improvement in general healthfulness and morality.

      If the cost of travel is not collected from passengers, it must be obtained by
taxation. In the vicinity of Melbourne the children are carried to and from the
free schools without charge, which, of course, makes it necessary that the amounts
otherwise collected from them are collected by taxation in other ways. One aim
in taxation should be to avoid taxing any class of individuals for the benefit of
another class ; in other words, making some rich and others poor by law.
                        TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.                           741

   There is a free ferry at Woolwich wliich carries any wbo wishes to travel

   between that place and North Woolwich without any charfje whatever. It has

   been ohserved that until the ferry was started the land at Nortli Woolwich was

   comparatively valueless; that the ferry created a rental value on the north side of

   the river which did not previously exist ; and that when the ferry was made as

   free as a free bridge, the land values at North Woolwich increased still further in

   rental value, even more than enough to pay for the cost of maintaining the free

   ferry. It therefore appears that the occupiers of land in North Woolwich pay a

   higher ground-rent on account of tbe ferry being free, or in other words, that they

   pay in rent what they save in fares ; and while they are saved some trouble in

   buying tickets, &c., the financial benefit of the free ferry goes into the pockets of

   the ground-landlords in North Woolwich. This instance points the way to secure

   free travel without burdensome taxation by simply taking the increased land values

   imparted by making travel free to pay the cost of the same. This would not be un-

   just or oppressive to anyone. It would not tax anyone's industry, but simply

   appropriate for public uses one of the effects of the public enterprise.

   Until the several upper floors of a new building are connected with the ground

   floors by stairways, the upper floors are comparatively valueless ; but when the

   stairways are put in the upper floors begin to have a value. If these floors are

   made still more accessible by free lifts or elevators, the value is still further in-

   creased. No company fitting up a large building for rental would think of letting

   another company put in lifts and charge a toll on their tenants. They would know

   that such a course would depreciate the rents of the upper floors. On the other

   hand, they make the use of the lifts free to the tenants, and more than recoup

   themselves for the cost by the increased rental value imparted to the upper floors.

   The situation with reference to free travel on railways and tramways is the same,

   only that passengers would not be carried up and down, but to and fro laterally

instead of vertically.

       Some years since, in Sydney, it became necessary for the municipality of Sydney

   to purchase certain lands for jjublic purposes. When the holder was approached for

   a price, he charged a great deal more than the then present value, ' because,' said he,

   * in a few years the value of the land will be considerably increased by the con-

   struction of railways and wharves in the vicinity of the laud.' The Government

   decided that this prospective value could not justly belong to the landowner, and

   that it would be the result, not of his industry, but of the public progress. They

   therefore took the land, pa3'ing the then present value for it. If this principle

could be applied to the free travel question, there would be no difficulty in securing

it without direct loss to anyone. If certain landowners should fail to receive a

prospective value, being the result of public and other improvements in their

vicinity or the result of making their lands more accessible by means of free travel,

they cannot claim that they have suffered loss, but can only say tb"! cue public

have decided not to make them a present of such unearned increment, but rather

to appropriate it to pay the expenses of making the land more accessible. It would

not be diiflcult to imagine the great benefits that would result from applying this

fair principle of taxation, because it would result in the payment of all costs of

roads, sewers, lights, police, parks, by a tax upon the lands enhanced in value by

   these public expenditures. The question would simply be whether the unearned

   increment should be given to landholders, or whether it should be taken by the

   public, who create it, to pay the expense of creating it.

   If this method of free travel should be adopted, the enormous expense of con-

structing and maintaining railways would be greatly lessened, (1) for the reason
that the Government, in constructing railways, would only have to pay for the

value of the improvements upon land which they appropriate for the purpose, the

unearned increment being previously taken in taxation. (2) There would be

another economy in the amount of taxes which are levied upon the plant and

Arolling-stock of railways, which would be exempt from taxation. (3)         good

economy would be effected in tbe management of railways, as all the expenses of

   printing, selling, and collecting tickets would be avoided. If the carriage of goods

land values imparted by these means. The saving of time on the part of the
public which is now spent in purchasing tickets and in booking merchandise would

also be very great.

been adopted in the few isolated instances which he has quoted. Mr. Cooper, of
Norwich, has given some very interesting figures showing the great economv which
would ensue to the public from the adoption of free travel.

1. Tlie Alleged Differences in the Wages paid to Men and to Women for
                   Similar Worlc. By Sidney Webb, LL.B.

The inferiority of women's earnings as compared with men's is notorious, but it

is not so clear that this inferiority is miconnected with a real inferiority of work,

either in quantity, quality, or nett advantageousness to the employer.

(a) Manual labour.-- Statistics indicate that the average earnings of women in

manufacturing industries are from one-third to two-thirds those of men. But it is
diiBcult to find many cases in which men and women are engaged upon precisely

similar work in the same place and at the same epoch. Thus, in the tailoring

Atrade it is practically impossible to discover any such instance.  similar difficulty

has been experienced in discovering crucial instances in the boot and shoe trade,

paper making, cigar making, and all the Birmingham industries.

    The clearest case is that of the Lancashire cotton weavers, where men and
women perform the same work, in the same shed, under practically the same legal

restrictions. Here the women, who are as strongly organised in Trade Unions as

the men, have for at least two generations received the same piecework rates as

the men, and skilled hands earn as much per week. Statistics are given showing

that this equality prevails in the weaving of other fabrics, both in France and in

England, but not in other branches of the textile industries.

    On the other hand, women compositors (who are not trade unionists) habitually

receive in Edinburgh and Paris, as well as in London, not only lower time wages

than men, but also distinctly lower piecework rates for work of exactly equal

quality. Facts given as to other occupations of women, where no organisation of

workers exist, show a general inferiority of women's wages.

"Where custom prevails, as in agricultural hirings by time, women, like boys,

get less than men. But in competitive agricultural hirings by the piece, as in

turnip-hoeing or harvesting, women and boys receive equal piecework rates with

the men.

   --(6) Routine meiital zvork. Here the statistics quoted with regard to type-

writers, clerks in the Post Office and a large insurance company, telegraphists, and

teachers, both in elementary and in secondary schools, show that women habitually

receive less than men for work of equivalent grade. Statistics of sickness in the

Post Office show that women are away from their work more days than men.

The salaries of women teachers in the United States are less than those of men,

but the difference is greatest where women have least independence, and it dis-

appears altogether in "S^'yoming, wbeie women have the suffrage, and the School
Law enacts that no distinction of wages according to sex shall be made.

(c) and (d) Artistic and intellectual wo7-k.^Few facts of economic significance

can be gleaned in these fields, but the cases of women singers and novelists, and

those of the Paris correspondent of the ' Daily News ' and the postmistress of

Gibraltar, show that women of special skill obtain their full ' rent of ability.'
     The only general conclusion that can be drawn appears to be that the in-

feriority of earnings is nearly always connected with inferiority of work. As a

rule the competition between men and women is a competition for ki7ids of work

and women earn less not only because they produce less, but also because what they

produce is usually valued in the market at a lower rate. This seems due mainly

to (a) custom, (b) public opinion, (c) women's lower standard of life, and (d) failure
to combine for their own protection. The remedies seem to lie in the direction of
education, both of public opinion and of women.

              2. The Taxation of Inventors. By Lewis Edmunds, D.Sc.

     There are few classes of the community, in a manufacturing and industrial

country like Great Britain, to whom the nation at large is more indebted for its

prosperity than the inventors. It would therefore appear to be to the interest of

the Government to oifer every facility and encouragement to inventors, and with
this object to afford them full opportunity for the acquisition and retention of
property in their discoveries. But the contrary is the fact. There is no species of

property which is so heavily pressed upon or so burdened with taxes as the very

limited one which the law allows an inventor to acquire.
    Although distinctions may be drawn, the monopoly granted by a patent is in

many respects of the same character as the copyright acquired by an author, and

the word copyright might be almost equally well applied to the rights acquired by
an author and by an inventor. But while the properties of an author and an

inventor are very similar in their nature, the position of an author is immensely

Hesuperior.   or his representatives hold the copyright for life and seven years after,

or for forty-two years from the date of publication, whichever may be the longer

term ; and no fees of any kind are payable to the Government, except when for the

purpose of securing rights in foreign countries, or of taking legal proceedings for

an infringement, it is necessary to register the copyright at Stationers' Hall, in

which case a small fee is demanded. There is no special taxation of authors of any
kind, unless, indeed, we count as such the five copies which have to be presented

to the British Museum and the University libraries, and this is a small matter. But
an inventor is not so fortunate. By the nature of the case, he can only secure

himself after complying with numerous formalities and making a full disclosure of
what his invention is. This, of course, cannot be complained of. But even then

the inventor obtains the monopoly of his invention for fourteen years only, and
this is now subject, after the first four years of the term, to the payment of heavy

annual fees, ranging from 10/. to 201. and amounting to 150/. in all. It is contended
that these renewal fees are an unjustifiable tax upon inventors, and also that the

preliminary fees payable at the Patent Ottice in connection with the application

for the grant of the patent and the lodging of the specifications being il., and quite
sufficient to cover the whole of the Office expenses, no further demand ought to be

made by the Treasury.

    If it were proposed to put a tax of 10/. or more a year on every literary work,

or  else  to  abolish  the  copyright  of  the  author,  the  suggestion  would  be  scouted                            yet
                                                                                                                     ;

inventors, with every claim to equality of treatment, are mulcted of these heavy

fees or else lose their patent right.

    Under the recent Patents Act of 1883, the total expense of a patent rimning

for the fuU term of fourteen years was reduced from 175/. to 154/., but the whole

abatement took place in the initial expenses, which were reduced from 25/. to 4/.

What are now called 'renewal fees' to the amount of 150/. are payable as before,

either in amounts of 50/. and 100/. before the end of the fourth and eighth years,

or in annual payments in the fourth and succeeding years varying from 10/. to 20/.

As a matter of fact, the patentees, with few exceptions, elect to make the annual

payments in preference to the lump sums of 50/. and 100/.

    In the United States of America inventors ai'e not discouraged as they are here.

There, a patent may be obtained, which lasts for seventeen years, for a payment of

Aabout 71. 10s. in the first instance, and no further fees of any kind are payable.

British patent which runs for fourteen years, therefore, costs more than twenty

times as much as a United States patent which endures for seventeen years. Con-

sequently, although there is a search as to novelty which weeds out a large
proportion, there are twice as many patents issued in the States as there are in
--744 REPORT 1891.

England, with correspondinp: advantages to the industries of that country. The
patenting of not only home but also foreign inventions is thereby encouraged, and
an inventor having obtained a patent is induced to push his invention, and to make
further improvements in it. The success of an invention means the improvement
or creation of some new industry, and hence the country shares with the patentee

in the profits of the invention.
      Looliing to the report of the Comptroller-General of Patents in this country

for the year 1889, it appears that the total income from fees on patents was
151,794/. 4s. 4(Z., of which sum 93,205/. was paid by way of -renewal fees. The
surplus profit of the Office was a little more than this sum, namely, 93,5.'!4^. 8s. 9(/.,
and this went to the Treasury, and was used for the general purposes of govern-
ment. It follows that if the annual taxes were abolished the Patent Office could
still pay its way. This surplus profit is, therefore, a direct tax upon the inventors.

     The taxation of inventors through the medium of ' renewal fees ' is a remnant
of the old demands and perquisites incident to the passing of letters patent under
the Great Seal. It is entirely inequitable in principle, it works great injustice and
hardship in practice, and, by damaging the value of property in inventions, acts as
a drag upon the inventive genius of the nation, and thereby injuriously affects all

the industries of the countr3\

     The following Papers and Report were read :

1. On Recent Progress in Indian Agriculture. By C. L. Tupper, Chief

     --Secretary to the Fuvjaub Government. See Reports, p. 532.

2. Bailivay Communications of India. By W. C. Furnivall, M.Inst.C.E.

     The paper gave at the outset a short history of railways in India since their
commencement about forty years ago, and stated the reasons for the introduction of

the metre gauge in 1871. Up to the beginning of this year (1801) 16,277 miles

 were open to public traffic, at a cost of 2,128 millions of rupees ; two-thirds of the
 length have been built on the standard gauge of 5 ft. 6 in., and the remainder on
the narrower gauge of one metre. The cost of these lines, according to the

--records, has been standard gauge about 170,000 rupees, and narrow gauge

 75,000 rupees per mile. But in this calculation no allowance has been made in tbe
 capital account for the fluctuating value of the rupee. The gold loan from
 England has been debited to India at the Exchange rates of the dates of transac-
 tions, and as the sterling value of the rupee has ranged between 2s. 2d. and some-
 thing under Is. 6d. during the last forty years, the obligations of the Government of
 India for gold interest, calculated in rupees, are heavy. On the capital outlay,
 estimated in rupees, the railways paid over 4^ per cent, last year. It is advanced
 as worthy of remark that the narrow gauge gave almost a similar return to that
 of the broad gauge on an expenditure per mile of less than one-half, but the broad
 gauge has been adopted for all frontier railways which are at present unremunera-

--tive. The author contended that 1. Indian railways have been well laid out^

 and are well built, but the introduction of a break of gauge must be viewed as a
 misfortune. 2. Passenger fares and goods rates are sufficiently low to attract
 traffic and promote trade with England, especially that of a supply of wheat.
 3. The demands of Indian railways on England for iron and steel equalled about
 one-tenth of the whole English exports of last year.

    A comparison is made between the rate of development of railways in the

 United States and India per unit of population. The census for this year gave
 286 millions in India, and the expenditure was, therefore, rupees 7'44 per head, or
 11 shillings. In like manner the length of the line finished was computed at 3^
                                                                     TRANSACTIONS OT' SECTION F.                                         745

inches per bead. In the United States in 1888 the length of railways open to

public traffic was 156,082 miles, and the outlay on construction was calculated at

9,369 millions of dollars. Esstimating the population at 60 millions, these figures

give 13| feet at a cost of 321. 4s. jjer head, which equal 47 times the length, and
58i times the expenditure per head in India. At this point it is observed the
comparison may be permitted to cease, because it would be absurd to imagine

conditions in India which could cause the profitable development of railways at

the rate maintained during recent years in the United States.

    The question arises, however, Have the English done enough in India ? The
latest records show that the population has increased by 29 millions within

the last decade, and it might reasonably be anticipated that increase in the future
will be progressive. Accounts show that a reasonable return for railM^ay invest-

ments has been obtained, and that the older lines are securing handsome dividends.

Experience indicates that the development of Indian railways opens an important
field of demand in the iron and steel industries of England, and furnishes a supply

of wheat, the price of which competes with America and Russia, so that the cost of
bread to the English consumer may be regulated. Experience also shows that
railways in India have done much to awaken the people to new lights, and to a
sense of new responsibilities which tend to the obliteration of old superstitions and

the generation of loyalty towards the central governing power, and of interest in

the maintenance of the Empire.

     It is true that the Indian currency has depreciated in its comparative value to
sterling money of late years, but it is pointed out that similar risks occurred else-

where, as, for instance, in the Argentine Republic, where the paper dollar depends

for its value in relation to gold on the honesty of a nation whose interests seem to be

separated widely from the interests of England. Up to the present time practi-

cally all railways constructed in India have been obtained by English capital guaran-

teed to pay a certain percentage by the Secretary of State, and consequently pro-

gress has been slow. India is poor, and the trading classes do not accept railway

investments                                                          but now that the circumstances  of India  are known  in  England ,  and
                                                                  ;

now that the records show that reasonable returns can be obtained if the railway

routes are selected with intelligence, even on the depreciated value of the rupee,

because its relative value has only changed in regard to gold, not as regards grain

and labour in India, the author suggests the question whether the private enter-

prise of England cannot lift this burden from off the shoulders of the Government,

and be induced to supply capital without the trammels of a Government

contract.

The following Papers were read :

1. On the Data Available for Determining tlie best Limit (pJajsically')
              for Hours of Labour. By J. T. Aelidge, M.D.

The author began by remarking that the great variability in capacity of the

human machine forbade the collection of facts, capable of measurement and of

statement in a statistical shape, for exact data. Consequently, those sought must

be derived from physiological facts and from consideration of the demands upon

human vigour made by the several occupations followed.

He treated his subject, therefore, under two heads, according as data are derived

from the consideration (A) of the individual worker, and (B) of the work to be per-

formed. The title of the paper confined his remarks to bodily or physical labour,

leaving undiscussed the equally distinct labour of the intellect, which happens to

be largely ignored in the popular idea of work and working-people.

Individual qualification for work varies in direct relation to (a) innate physical

endowments; (/3), to the extent of freedom from disease, hereditarj' or acquired,

and  from bodily deformity                                                                                                         (y) to original  and  acquired aptitude for labour ;                            and
                                                                                                                                ;

(S), in some measure, to mental gifts. Idiosyncrasy and racial characteristics are

other mmor factors determining ability for certain kinds of employment. These

diversities in individual capacity for work show the futility of general rules to

govern all men's labour.

     In the second division of the subject the leading conditions of labour as affecting

the construction of data were examined. First of these is the amount of actual

bodily effort called for. Though this in great excess is detrimental to health and
            TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.                                                                                                                                                               747

life, its eflFects are less pronounced than sedentary work, statistics clearly proving

that the comparative mortality figure of the latter, as illustrated by numerous

trades, is considerably greater than that of active and strong muscular exertion.

Moreover, apart from physical toil, there are a multitude of collateral and

accidental conditions of employment of great influence upon capability for labour,

and which call for examination when data for limiting the extent and duration are
searched for. Among such are the situation of work, whether in the open country

or in a town ; whether above or beneath the surface of the ground ; and, in connec-
tion with these circumstances, the existence of darkness, of foul air, or noxious

fumes, of the presence of dust, whether poisonous or not, of elevated temperature,

or of highly increased atmospheric pressure. With reference to mining, in which
many unfavourable conditions enter, it seemed desirable that the hours of labour

be shortened. Nevertheless, were the evidence of the production of a high death-

rate to be accepted as the criterion for curtailing working hours, mining would

not challenge the first place, but be surpassed by several other occupations, and

especially by the manufacture of cutlery and of pottery. In demonstrating the in-

fluence of incidental conditions of work upon the sources of data, illustrations were,

for the most part, drawn from the character of mining operations.

To guard against misunderstanding, the writer called attention to the fact that

the remarks made applied to adults                                                                                                                                                                   and that, in the case of children, distinct data
                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

for limiting labour existed in imperfect development and advancing growth in

--body and mind data, indeed, rightly used in framing the restrictions of the Fac-

tory Acts.

Lastly, whilst admitting the existence of trades presenting conditions of labour

seriously prejudicial to health and life, and calling, in consequence, for some limi-

tation of the hours and extent of labour, he deprecated general interference by

legislative enactments with the freedom of men in the pursuit of their selected

trades, as being prejudicial to enterprise and to the manufacturing interests of the

country, and also as destructive of individual responsibility, and of the feeling of

independence, by replacing the natural law of self-preservation by State nursing.

5. Recent Changes in the Bistrilution of Population in England and Wales.

                                   By Edwin Oannan.

     The rough-and-ready method of describing the great change which has taken
place in the distribution of the population of England and Wales during the present
century is to say that the North has enormously increased in comparison with the
South. It is more accurate to say that the tendency. of the increasing population
has been to mass itself more and more in six comparatively small areas, viz., London,
Lancashire, the West Riding of Yorkshire, Staffordshire with Birmingham, the
county of Durham with Newcastle, Tynemouth, and Middlesbrough, and, lastly,
Glamorgan.

     Of these six localities Glamorgan only is shown by the Preliminary Report of
the Census of 1891 to be gaining on the rest of the country as fast as ever. The
rate of gain on the part of the Durham district, Lancashire, the West Riding,
and the Staffordshire district shows so great a decline that it seems likely to dis-
appear entirely before long. The gain of London has also somewhat diminished,
but is still very great if all the suburban country be included.
--748 REPORT 1891.

     The diminutiou of loss v^Lich counterbalaEces this diminution of gain is spread
OYer the rest of England. It is greatest in tbe south-western counties.

     Trustworthy statistics as to the comparative growth of urban and rural popula-
tion, or of large and small towns, seem scarcely obtainable ; but there seems no
reason to suppose there is any great change in the prevailing tendencies with regard
to either of these matters.

    The diminishing gain of the manufacturing districts may result from some

check being received by the tendency of this country to become weaver and black-
smith for the whole world, or from the proportionate decline which, in the progress
of civilisation, inevitably overtakes the industries which supply the necessaries of
life as compared with those which supply its conveniences and amusements.

present meeting of the British Association.

    The addresses of my eminent predecessors have, year by year, in the best

language, and in the most condensed form, gauged the progress of, and indicated

the direction in which, further improvements in mechanical science may be looked
for. In so large a field as that of mechanical engineering my somewhat limited
knowledge will not admit of my following very closely in their footsteps ; but

possibly, by tracing tlie modern practice of this branch as applied to mining opera-
tions in Great Britain, I may be able to submit some points of interest to mechanical

engineers.

    Great progress has been made in mechanical science since the British Associa-
tion met in the Principality of Wales eleven years ago ; and some of the results

of that progress are exemplified in our locomotives, marine engineering, and in such

works as the Severn Tunnel, the Forth and Tay Bridges, and the Manchester Ship
Canal, which is now in progress of construction.

In mining, the progress has been slow, and it is a remarkable fact that, with

the exception of pumping, the machinery in use in connection with mining opera-

tions in Great Britain has not, in regard to economy, advanced so rapidly as has

been the case in our manufactures and marine.

This is probably due, in metalliferous mining, to the uncertain nature of the

mineral deposits not aSbrding any adequate security to adventurers that the

increased cost of adopting improved appliances will be reimbursed ; whilst in coal
mining, the cheapness of fuel, the large proportion which manual labour bears to

the total cost of producing coal, and the necessity for producing large outputs with

the simplest appliances, explain, in some measure, the reluctance with which high-
pressure-steam compound engines, and other modes embracing the most modern

and approved types of economising power, have been adopted.

     Metalliferous mining, with the exception of the working of iron ore, is not in
a prosperous condition owing to causes to which it is unnecessary to refer ; but in
special localities, where the deposits of minerals are rich and profitable, progress has
been made within a recent period by the adoption of more economical and efficient

machinery.

For example, at the Tincroft Tin Mine, in Cornwall, a compound winding plant

has been erected by Messrs. Harvey, of Hayle, of which the following are par-
ticulars : The high-pressure cylinder is 17 inches in diameter and steam-jacketed,

and the low-pressure cylinder is 30 inches in diameter, each having a stroke of
A6 feet.
            condenser is worked by levers off" the crosshead of the low-pressure

cylinder. The drum is 8 feet 6 inches in diameter, and of the plain cylindrical type.

The engine is fitted with steam reversing gear, and an auxiliary steam valve for

adtnittino' high-pressure steam to either end of low-pressure cylinder when
required." The working pressure of steam is 90 lbs. per square incli. This engine
has proved so satisfactory that the management of the mine have been induced to
erect a new horizontal condensing compound air-compressing engine in place of
their existing plant. This engine will have high- and low-pressure cylinders of
1.5J and 27 inches diameter respectively, by 48-inch stroke, and the air cylinder is

22 inches in diameter, with an equal stroke, and is fitted with Trestrail's patent inlet
and outlet valves, and is arranged for a working pressure of 100 lbs. per square inch.

     At the Greenside Lead Mines, near UUswater, a waterfall of upwards of
100 horse-power is now being utilised by means of a turbine to drive dynamos,
the eneroy from which is transmitted for the purposes of winding, pumping, and
lighting ; and, again, at the Morgan Gold Mmes, near Dolgelly, there is a modern
example of the successful utilisation of water-power for compressed air, and for
drivint^ forty head of stamps. The water-power for driving the mill is obtained
from the river Mawddach, and is brought on to a 22-inch turbine, ^^·ith a 68-feet
head ; this fall, with 650 cubic feet of water, easily drives the mill, stone breakers,
&c. and with 800 cubic feet of water applied, if required, the water-power can be

raised to 100 horse-power.
     And, as an example of the very large amount of mechanical power applied in

exceptional circumstances to metalliferous mining operations, the Whicham
Hfematite Iron ilines, in South Cumberland, may be named, where the quantity of

water raised frooi a depth of 552 feet occasionally exceeds 4,800 gallons per minute,

the machinery employed consisting of
     Firstly, a Cornish beam-condensing pumping engine, having a 90-inch diameter

cylinder by 11-feet stroke, with a 10-feet stroke in the pumps. The beam weighs
50 tons. There are attached to this engine three pump-rams, each 28 inches in dia-
meter, fixed at certain points in the shaft, the bottom ram being fixed 552 feet
below the surface, from which level the whole of the water is pumped. The quan-
tity of water delivered per minute is 2,210 gallons. There is also another Cornish
beam-condensing pumping engine, with a cylinder of 110 inches in diameter by
11-feet .stroke, with a 9-feet stroke in the pumps. This beam weighs 55i tons.
Attached to this engine are three 30-inch diameter pump-rams forcing from the
same level as that before mentioned a quantity of 2,295 gallons of water per
minute. In November and December during heavy floods as much as 4,680 gallons
have been pumped from this mine per minute by these two engines.

    The average consumption of coal by these engines is equal to about 4 lbs. per

indicated horse-power.
     There is another engine erected at this mine which is kept in reserve in the

event of anything happening to either of the two other engines which I have
described, viz., a tandem horizontal compound condensing pumping engine, having
a 40-inch high pressure, and a 70-inch low pressure cylinder by 9-feet stroke. This
eno-ine is fitted with Davey's difierential valve gearing. There is attached to this
enoine two 24-inch diameter pump-rams fixed at a point 372 feet below the surface.
Tliese pumps are capable of dealing with 280 gallons of water with each stroke of
the engine, and the maximum .speed is seven strokes per minute, which represents,
therefore, 1 960 oallons of water per minute. Provision is made with this engine
to extend the pumps to a lower level when necessary.

     The weight of the pumps and pipes connected with these engines is about

250 tons.
     In the raising of coal from our mines and placing it on board ship in our

docks, there is a vast amount of machinery employed, much of which is now of an
obsolete type. Where, however, new winnings have been made, or where in old
mines it has been found necessary to replace the old machinery by new, the ques-
tion of efficiency and, at the same time, economy in machinery has of late years

received serious attention.

     The consideration of the question of economy in the employment of steam in
coal-mining operations has resulted in boilers of the most modern construction

being erected, working to pressures varying from 80 to 150 lbs. per square inch, as

compared with pressures varying from 40 to 50 lbs. per square inch in the old
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.  751

boilers, whilst the various engines are now being constructed on the most modern

and improved principle.

    Compressed air has for many years been used extensively in our coal mines as
a motive power. Electricity also has made rapid strides in the same direction

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

and I have no doubt that, in conjunction with a better type of machinery for the
compression and use of air, will eventually become the principal agent in under-
ground mechanical operations.

     Many large electrical installations have already been in use for a considerable
period. Notably amongst the number I may mention that at Messrs. Locke

& Co.'s St. John's Colliery, Normanton, where both hauling on the endless-rope

system and pumping are very largely adopted, and it has been proved that a useful
effect equal to 60 per cent, can be obtained. This high rate of efficiency is un-
doubtedly very satisfactory. I am, however, of opinion that there is still great
room for improvement in electrical plant before it will be adopted in preference to
other machinery now in general use, especially in gaseous mines, and these im-
provements must embrace a certain means of rendering sparking absolutely harmless
under all conditions, for it involves not only the question of the increased effi-
ciency of one class of machinery over another, but also the protection of human life.

     There must also be devised a ready means of reversing the power, so that the
system of haulage known as the main-and-tail-rope system can be applied with
equal safety and readiness in any part, as compared with absolute safety in the use
of compressed air.

    An electrical hauling plant to be worked on this system (which I am sure will
be watched with very great interest) is now erected at one of the Plymouth

collieries in this district, by an eminent firm of electricians, as a trial and demon-
stration of what can be done in this direction. This will comprise, when fully com-
plete, a generating plant at the top of the pit, and two electrically-driven hauling-
engines underground, connected by a suitable cable carried down the shaft and along
the roadway for some 1,200 yards.

    The generating plant and one hauling-engine are now erected, and the other

hauling-engine will shortly be ready.

     The generating plant consists of a 40 horse-power compound engine working at
110 revolutions per minute ; this engine drives by belt a specially constructed
dynamo, which is of a horizontal pattern, built on a wrought-iron girder bed plate.
It is compound wound, and capable of giving off 160 amperes with 500 volts
pressure, running at 500 revolutions per minute.

     The cable, which is 3,200 yards in length, is made of 37 strands of No. 14
high conductivity copper-wire, highly insulated with vulcanised bitumen, double-
taped, and surrounded wtli two layers of jute yarn compounded between each,
and is protected by a double sheath of No. 8 steel-wire. It is of sufficient size to
carry the necessary current, and in case of falls of roof it has been constructed so

that it will stand a shearing strain of 10 tons per square inch.

     The hauling-engine consists of two drums, each fitted with a clutch and foot-
brake. The drum-shaft is driven from a counter-shaft by spur gearing, and this
counter-shaft is driven from the motor by six ropes 1 inch in diameter.

     The motor is a shunt-wound machine, built to run at 600 revolutions per
minute, and works with 80 amperes at 450 volts, and is able to take 160 amperes
without harm at starting. The whole engine is mounted on a wrought-iron bed-
frame. The motor will be reversed by a specially-designed switch, the efficiency
of which has yet to be proved. The useful effect of this plant, when working at
full power, is expected to be from 60 to 65 per cent.

     Possibly the leather-belting and ropes used for transmitting the power from the
motor to the hauling-drums or pumps, might with advantage be replaced by some-
thing less liable to be damaged by the rough usage and other contingencies usually
met with undergroimd.

    As I have previously mentioned, compressed air is another motive power very

largely used in coal-mining, it being not only absolutely safe in explosive atmospheres,
but tends to reduce any danger which might exist from sudden outbursts of gas

by assisting the ventilation. This may be considered as rather an expensive

upon-Tyne Meeting of this Association, in 1889, by Professor Alex. B. W.

Kennedy, on the experiments he had made in Paris upon the transmission of power

by compressed air, in which he states that an indicated efficiency of 31 per cent,

can be got from cold air, and 45 per cent, from air which has been heated after

compression. Tt is very doubtful, however, if in any compressed-air installation
used in coal-mining there is more than 30 per cent, of useful effect obtained in

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

many instances it is much less, as it is impossible in almost every case to heat the

air after it has passed into the mine ; and another source of loss is due to leakage,
caused in a great measure by the occasional upheaval of the ground disturbing the

pipes. It is thus obvious that compressed air is more costly than electricity but
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

up to the present time it is the only absolutely safe power which is capable of

being conveyed long distances underground in mines giving off fire-damp.

    A very large compressing plant has quite recently been erected in this district,

and another will very shortly be installed                                                                                                                                                                                              this latter will consist of two  pairs  of
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

tandem compound steam-engines, each pair having two high-pressure cylinders 22

inches in diameter, and two low-pressure cylinders each 40 inches in diameter, by

5-feet stroke. The air cylinders are 34 inches in diameter, one being placed behind

each low-pressure cylinder. Each high-pressure cylinder is provided with variable

expansion valves, which can be adjusted whilst the engines are working. The

independent condensing apparatus consists of a pair of engines having 10-inch

diameter cylinders, and 20-inch diameter air-pumps, by 2-feet 6-inch stroke, and

are so arranged that they can be worked together as a pair, or as single engines

and condensers.

     The pressure of steam at the boilers will be 150 lbs. per square inch, so that a
high degree of expansion may be obtained, and as the inlet and outlet valves of the

air-cylinders are of large area, and are perfectly free to act in sympathy with the

pistons in the air-cylinders, it is only reasonable to expect the' highest degree of
efficiency which can be obtained from steam-power applied to compressing air.
Each pair of air-compressing engines will be capable of developing at least 800

horse-power, or a total of 1,600 indicated horse-power in the installation.

    No provision has been made in this plant for compounding the air-cylinders

or the motors ; but it has been pointed out by Professor Elliott, of the Cardiff

University, in a very interesting and able paper read before the South Wales

Institute of Engineers, that great economy will result in compounding the air and

motors. Professor Elliott estimates the extra efficiency, under certain conditions

(if high pressure, as upwards of 11 per cent. Further investigation in regard to

defining the relative economy of using high- and low-pre.ssed air for underground

mining operations, and the relative cost of the plant adapted for the production

and application of each, is required before it can be definitely decided that air of

a pressure above four atmospheres, but with air-cylinders and motors compounded,

will result in real economy. It appears on tlie first blush as if we might look in

the direction indicated to secure a material increase in the effective power obtain-

able from compressed air.

In some of our coal fields very hard seams or veins of coal are met with, and

various kinds of machinery have been devised to assist the coal hewer in .severing

the coal from the solid strata, and electrical appliances have in this class of

machinery been more or less successful. It appears to me, however, that there is

a want of simplicity about the majority of the machines which have come under

my notice, which will operate against their general adoption.

In the conveyance of coal underground, from the face of the workings where it

i« loaded into the trams by the workmen, to the bottom of the shaft, several systems

of haulage are adopted, either worked direct by steam-power, compressed air, or

electrical motors, the principal of which are known as the endless-rope, main-and-

tail-rope, and main-rope systems. The two former systems are used where the

ground is either level or undulating, and where power has to be applied to haul

the trams or tubs in both directions, and the latter system is generally used where

there is a gradient in one direction, sufficient to allow the trams or tubs to run by
                                                                                                    TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                                                         753

gravitation, and haul the rope after them. The cost of the conveyance of coal

underground is a very considerable item in South Wales, probably amounting to

600,000/. to 700,000/. per annum, and consequently has caused great attention to

be given to the subject. It has been found that the endless-rope system, where it

can be conveniently applied, is the cheapest. This system, however, necessitates

the laying and maintaining of either a double Hue of rails, or frequent passing

points or loops, and as the nature of the strata does not always admit of the roads

being made and maintained wide enough for this to be done, the main-and-tail

system, which requires a single line of rails only, has in that event to be adopted.

The distance to which some of these haulage systems extend is very great (in some

cases exceeding three miles); and, having regard to the large quantities which have

to be conveyed by mechanical haulage in single collieries, in many instances 1,000

to 1,500 tons of coal in ten hours, very good and powerful machinery is required,

and it is not unusual to have engines of 600 indicated horse-power placed under-

ground for this purpose. In other cases where the coal is brought from several

districts to the bottom of the shafts, smaller engines are used. For endless-rope

haulage, the speed at which the trams or tubs travel is from two to six miles per

hour, as against from ten to twenty miles per hour by the main-and-tail system
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

thus there is much greater wear and tear in the latter than in the former. The

type of engine usually adopted for this work varies considerably according to cir-

cumstances, and the ideas of the engineer by whom the work is planned. They

are, however, invariably horizontal, and fitted with a second motion shaft, on which

the hauling drums are arranged. There is still a large number of horses employed

underground, at very great cost, principally to collect the trams from the colliers

and convey them to the station, from which poiut the engine hauls them, and it is

to this class of haulage that I would particularly direct the attention of mechanical

engineers. What is required is an absolutely safe and simple means of light haul-

age, made as portable as possible, so that it can be readily moved from one position

to another, as circumstances may require, and arranged so as to replace the horses.

Thus the coal is brought to the bottom of the shaft, and thence up the shaft by

means of the winding engine. This class of engine has of late years been very

materially improved                                                                                 instead of the low-pressure vertical-beam condensing engine,
                                                                                                 ;

which was so commonly in use many years ago, and some of which are still iu

existence, we have now the high-pressure compound condensing engine, working

with a boiler pressure varying from 80 to 150 lbs. per square inch. Some of our

winding engines are very powerful and run at very high velocities. This will be

the more readily understood from the fact that, at some pits, the carriages on which

the coal is raised in the shaft attain a speed equal to from forty to forty-five miles

Aper hour, and the dead load lifted is as great as twenty tons each lift. few of the

leading sizes of a large pair of winding engines now in use at one of the collieries
in this district may be mentioned. The engines are vertical, with inverted

cylinders of 54 inches in diameter, and admit                                                       of a  7-feet stroke                                                            the cylinders are
                                                                                                                                                                                ;

Steam-jacketed, and the valves double-beat, placed in pairs in nozzle-boxes, fixed

to the port-branches at the top and bottom of each cylinder. The valves are

worked by the ordinary rocking lifters, to which is added, for the steam valves,

the simple triple expansion gear first introduced by Mr. Barclay, of Kilmarnock.

AThe cylinders are supported by double frames of cast iron, fixed to heavy cast-

iron bedplates, to which also is attached the main shaft plummer-blocks. The

winding-drum is of the conical type, graduating from 16 feet to 32 feet, and is

made of steel plates and ribs and cast-iron centres. The total weight of the

drum, drum-shaft, and the engine-cranks, and one rope, exceeds 100 tons. The

engine is fitted with a powerful steam brake, and also a self-acting reversing gear,

which reversing gear also applies the steam brake, in case of any neglect on the

part of the engine-man. There is also being built, for a colliery in this coalfield,

a pair of large compound condensing winding engines, by Messrs. Fowler, of Leeds.

which will embrace all the latest improvements. They will consist of a pair fi

horizontal compound winding engines fitted with condensers ; the high-pressure

cylinder, being 32 inches in diameter by 5-feet stroke, will actuate one crank,

whilst the low-pressure cylinder, 48 inches in diameter by 5-ftet stroke, will actuate

the other crank ; both cylinders are fitted with Cornish valves, and on the high-

pressure cylinder there is fitted automatic variable expansion, worked by a governor,

and the initial pressure of steam will be 150 lbs. per square inch. This engine will

be fitted with a plain cylindrical drum, 18 feet in diameter, and a balance rope will

be attached to the underside of the carriages, so that everything will be in perfect

balance.

     Between the high- and low-pressure cylinders is a receiver on which is fixed a
valve arrangement, by which the steam can be expanded out of the receiver, or

live steam can be admitted into it. This arrangement greatly facilitates the ease

of starting the engines.

As it is intended to raise the load from the bottom to the top of the shaft in

forty seconds, and as, during part of each lift, the speed will probably get up to

3,500 feet per minute, the engines at that time will probably indicate 1,500

horse-power.

Mechanical ventilation, by exhausting the air, has almost entirely superseded

the furnace ventilation in general use many j'ears ago, and which created a current
by heat. There are many types of fans ; the best known are the ' Schiele,'
' Guibal,' and ' Waddell.' Some very large fans are now in use, and at the present

time the large quantity of 500,000 cubic feet of air per miuute is capable of being

passed through one of the mines in this district by a ' Schiele ' fan, with a water-

Agauge of 4 inches.                         very exhaustive series of trials is being made by a committee

appointed by the North of England Institute of Engineers, which I have no doubt

will bring to light many interesting features in the various types of fans in general

use, and indicate accurately the relative economic values of each.

Some of our coal mines are very heavily watered, and this involves large and

costly pumping machinery, which takes various forms, the most generally used of

which is perhaps the old-fashioned but economical Cornish vertical condensing

steam engine, which, with its heavy rods and pumps, occupies a considerable

portion of the room in the shaft. In recent years, however, there has been a ten-

dency to apply the direct-acting forcing engine, fixed at the bottom of the shaft, of

which there are various forms ; and still more recently, pumps, worked by electrical
power, are being brought into use, and in underground workings far away from the

shafts this power seems eminently suitable, as the work in pumping required can be

so regulated as to be constant, thereby reducing the risk of danger from sparking.

    Many excellent forms of direct-acting pumping engines have been designed, the

most economical being the compound condensing direct-acting ram-pump, which

takes up little space. Perhaps the worst feature in adopting direct-acting pumps

is the fact that steam must be conveyed down the shaft, which means a certain

loss by condensation ; a loss which can, however, be very materially reduced by

having the steam pipes properly protected from exposure by suitable coverings.

The steam and water pipes for this type of pump take up much less pit room than

those of the Cornish pump, and this is of very great moment where the area of the

shafts is limited.

   A type of pump which has been adopted in some of our northern mines, and

which I should like to notice, is the hydraulic pump patented by Mr. Joseph

Moore, C.E., of Glasgow.

The object of this invention is attained by means of hydraulic pressure, and one

of the prominent advantages gained, is that it enables the steam engine, which

generates the power, to be placed on the surface, and near to the boilers, thus ob-

viating the loss due to the condensation of steam when conveyed great distances.
To the steam engine on the surface is attached a double-acting power ram, of the
ordinary type, and there are also similar power rams attached to the pump under-

ground                                      these rams are connected to  each other by small pipes, filled with water,
                                         ;

which, when under pressure, convey the reciprocating motion of the engine on

the surface to the pump underground.

    Anotlier type of pumping engine now largely used in mining is that manu-
factured by Messrs. Hathorn, Davey, & Co., of Leeds ; a notable instance of this

type of engine is at Bradley, in Statfordshire, where one engine raises 4,000,000

gallons a day, a height of 490 feet. The chief improvements introduced in these
                   TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                                                             fSS

engines of late years have been the trip gear, by means of which the steam

communication between the high- and low-pressure cylinders is automatically

stopped in case of accident, and the consequent cushioning of the steam in the high

pressure cylinder  brings the  engine gradually to rest without  shock                          and also  the
                                                                                             ;

pausing gear, by means of which a definite interval between the strokes is obtained.

In heavy lifts, this is of great advantage, by giving time for the valves to settle
down to their seats at the end of each stroke, which minimises wear and tear, and

it also enables the engine, when running at one or two strokes a minute, to make

a brisk stroke and then pause, thus obviating the disadvantage of water slipping

back through the valves, which is always the case when an engine makes a very

slow stroke.

     Another type of engine, which is increasing in favour, is the hydraidic engine

at the bottom of the shaft, actuated by a steam engine at the top, on a similar
principle to that introduced many years ago by Lord Armstrong for working the

machinery in docks. This system possesses the advantage of occupyino- the

minimum of space either at the pit top or in the shaft, and the power can be ap-
plied at any point iu the pit without the inconvenience which attends the actua-

Ation of pumps by spear rods at any other point than at the bottom of the shaft.

plant of this kind has been working at Marseilles for some years, raising 1,700
gallons per minute 311 feet high, with an accumulator pressure of forty-two atmo-

spheres.

    On leaving the carriage the trams of coal are weighed, and the coal is then
tipped on to the screen, where it is cleaned and divided into the necessary number
of saleable sizes (which is usually regidated by the quality of the coal ), and then

placed in the trucks for transportation. Considerable improvements have recently
been made in our screening apparatus, which is probably due, partly to the

increased proportion of dirt or dross found in some of the seams now worked,
and partly to the necessity of having a more improved and effective apparatus,
having regard to the increased cost of working the coal, and consequently to its
increased value. The improvements in this direction have taken the form chiefly
of travelling belts, moving at a slow speed in lieu of the ordinary falling screen.

    At the docks also, the machinery for placing the coal on board ship has been

greatly improved, so as to prevent breakage, one of the most recent improvements

being the movable tip, w^hich can be adjusted to suit the varying sizes of ships.
Some of these tips are made on the principle of the jib crane, the coal being tipped
from the truck into large iron boxes, which are lowered into the ship's hold, and
the coal dropped out of the bottom of the box. Others are fitted with what might
be termed an auxiliary crane, by which the coal is lowered in boxes into the ship's

hold, the truck being, first of all, placed on a cradle, which is raised by hydraulic
rams to the necessary height, when it is tipped to such an angle as to cause the
coal to run out of the truck through a shoot, extending over the ship's hatchway, into
what is termed the anti-breakage box. The box being filled is then lowered into

the ship's hold, but its use is discontinued as soon as a sufficient quantity of coal

has been loaded to form a cone sufficiently large to prevent further breakage. The
anti-breakage box is then swung out of the way, and the coal allowed to slide from

the shoot on to the cone, and into the hold where it is trimmed into position.
     Summarising the po.sition of mechanical science, as applied to our coal-mining

industry in this country, it may be observed, that there is a general awakening

to the necessity of adopting, in the newer and deeper mines, more economical

appliances.

    It is true that it would be impracticable, and probably unwise, to alter much of
the existing machinery, but, by the adoption of the best-known types of electrical
plant, and air compression in our new and deep mines, the consumption of coal per
horse-power would be reduced, and the extra expense, due to natural causes, of
producing minerals from greater depths would be substantially lessened. The

consumption of coal at the collieries in Great Britain alone probably -exceeds
10,000,000 tons per annum, and the consumption per horse-power is probably not
less than 6 lbs. of coal, and it is not unreasonable to assume that, by the adoption
of more efficient machinery than is at present in general use, at least one-half of the

                                                                                                3 82
756 BEPOBT-- 1891.

coal consumed could be saved. There is, therefore, in the mines of Great Britain
alone a wide and lucrative field for the inventive ingenuity of mechanical engineers
in economising fuel, and especially in the successful application of new methods for
dealing with underground haulage, in the inner workings of our collieries, more
especially in South Wales, where the number of horses still employed is very large.

    Leaving the subject of mining, I may observe that considerable progress has
within recent years been made in the mechanical appliances intended to replace
horses on our public tram lines. The steam engine now in use in some of our towns

has its drawbacks as well as its good qualities, as also has the endless-rope haulage,
and in the case of the latter system, anxiety must be felt when the ropes show signs
of wear. The electrically-driven trams appear to work well. I have not, however,
seen any published data bearing on the relative cost per mile of these several
systems, and this information, when obtained, will be of interest.

    At the present time, I understand, e.'ihaustive trials are being made with an
ammonia gas engine, which, it is anticipated, will prove both more economical and
efficient than horses for tram roads. The gas is said to be produced from the pure
ammonia, obtained by distillation from commercial ammonia, and is given off
at a pressure varying from 100 to 150 lbs. per square inch. This ammonia is used

in specially-constructed engines, and is then exhausted into a tank containing water,
which brings it back into its original form of commercial ammonia, ready for re-
distillation, and, it is stated, with a comparatively small loss.

    Much attention in modern times has been given to the relative values of the
numerous new explosives, which have been introduced for blasting in mines and
for other purposes. Sir Frederick Abel is the greatest authority upon this subject.
As applied to mining, various experiments have from time to time been made for
the purpose of testing how far it would be safe to employ these explosives in the

atmosphere of a coal mine without the risk of causing an explosion of fire-damp.

A number of these are mainly composed of compounds of nitro-glycerine with

aluminous earth. But, whilst the experiments have indicated that, with rare
exceptions, they are practically flameless, it is undoubted that one which would be
absolutely so, and which could be used with safety in fiery mines, has yet to be

produced.

     The adoption in our gaseous mines of a flameless explosive, a self-contained
electric lamp of moderate weisrht which will burn without attention for twelve
hours, and the general application of water to moisten the dust, are all more or
less questions in which the mechanical engineer is interested, and, when adopted,
will probably have the effect of putting an end to the disastrous explosions
accompanied by loss of life which occur at intervals in our fiery collieries, and I
trust that the deliberations of this Section may result in the practical adoption of

steps to secure this desirable object.

     In conclusion, as an inhabitant of Cardiff, I may be permitted to congratulate

this port on this, the first visit of the British Association. Its rising import-
ance is becoming generally recognised, and, since the last visit of the British
Association to the Principality, material progress has been made. Lord Bute has
constructed a large dock of 33 acres at Cardiff, and a still larger dock of nearly 70
acres has been constructed at Barry within the port of Cardiff. The tonnage of
shipping cleared at the port has increased during the past eleven years 91 per

cent. Various new industries have been established here, notably, the manufacture
of hfematite iron for steel making, on a large scale* by the Dowlais Iron Company ;

and the exportation of coal has increased from 5,862,349 tons in 1880 to 12,250,652
tons in 1890, or 109 per cent. At Swansea the manufacture of tin plates, which
is one of the leading industries of the western part of this country, has increased
from 25,.343 tons to 229,791 tons in 1890; and the trade at the neighbouring port
of Newport has also materially developed, all showing a rapid progressive develop-
ment of the large resources of South Wales.

    I trust that only a short interval will elapse before we are honoured with^
another visit of the British Association, and that it will be the good fortune of
the President, who may have the honour of occupying this chair on that occasion,

to chronicle similar progress.

3. The Biver UsJc, and the Harhour of Newport. By L. F. Yernon-Harcocrt,
       M.A., M.Inst.G.E., Engineer to the Newport Harhour Commission.

The river Usk rises on the western horder of Bi-eckiiockshire, and, traversing

this county and Monmouthshire, it flows into the Bristol Channel, ahout 4

miles helow Newport, after a course of 65 miles. Its basin is 6-34 square miles

and the Afon Llwyd joins it at Caerleon, and the Ebbw near its mouth. The com-

mercial importance of the Usk commences below Newport Bridge, about 6 miles

from its mouth and wharves extend                                                      along  the  right  bank  for 2\ miles below the
                                                                                    ;

bridge, and the vessels lying at the wharves rest, at low tide, on the soft mud

covering specially levelled berths. The Newport and Alexandra Docks also afford

floating accommodation for large vessels on the western side of the river, on which

IHside the town of Newport is mainly situated. These docks have water areas of

and 285 acres respectively, and the depth of water over the sills of their entrances,

Aat spring tides, is .30 and 35 feet.                                                  large extension of the Alexandra Dock, and

a new entrance lower down the river, are approaching completion. The quays are

supplied with coal tips, sidings, and hydraulic appliances ; and the docks and

wharves are connected by railway with the mines and works in the neighbouring

district. The eastern side of the river is almost wholly undeveloped; but roads

are being made, arid the East Usk Eailway has been authorised, which will give

facilities for trade, and .should lead to the extension of the port along the left bank.
The portion of the river constituting the harbour of Newport is very winding ; and
though it increases considerably in width between the bridge and its mouth, thus

favouring the tidal influx, the enlargement is not uniform, which causes changes

in the velocity of the current, and promotes deposit in the channel where the cross

section is excessive. Moreover, the bends of the river make the flow and ebb,

coming in opposite directions, form channels on opposite sides of the river between

the bends, leading to the growth of a central sandbank between these side channels.

Besides these central shoals of sand and silt, readily formed in a river densely

charged with material in suspension, there are some hard natural shoals of clay and

stones, and also shoals at the confluence of tributaries, formed of detritus and

refuse from works, brought down by the current in flood-time, and deposited in

the Usk. The great tidal rise of the Usk, amounting to 34 feet at the bridge and

40 feet at the mouth at the top of springs, and 14 and 16^ feet respectively at

neaps, has hitherto enabled Newport to maintain a large and increasing sea-going

trade, in spite of the deficiencies mentioned above. Comparative cross sections of

the river, taken in 1884 and 1890, have shown, however, that accretion is taking

place in the river, and gradually reducing its depth, whilst the draft of vessels

tends to increase. Accordingly the Commissioners have decided, on the advice of

the author, to dredge a channel across these shoals, so as to form an adequately

wide navigable channel, not less than from 24 to 20 feet deep at high water of

the lowest neap tide, down to the Alexandra Dock entrance, and 26 feet deep (or

2 feet lower than the lowest dock sill) from this point to the mouth of the river.

These works, involving the removal of over 300,000 cubic yards of material from the

bed of the river, will meet the present requirements of the port ; .and further

improvements can be gradually carried out in conjunction with the work of

maintenance, as circumstances may render expedient. The formation of this

improved channel will lower the low-water line, and regulate its fall, which at

present is not uniform, and thus increase the tidal capacity of the river, and im-

prove the scour of the current. In order to render the flow of the river more

uniform, to stop tlie erosion of tlie banks, to reduce the rate of accretion, and to
aid the development of the left side of the river, regulation works have been pro-

posed at certain places -where the width of the river is excessive. By these
works, the Harbour Commissioners will give to Newport and the surrounding
mineral districts similar advantages to those which have been conferred, by more

extensive works, upon Other river ports less favoured by nature, will aid in pro-
moting that growth of trade which Newport has enjoyed during the last thirty
years, and will prevent the diversion of traffic which an irregular channel of
occasionally inadequate depth would sooner or later produce.

    The following Papers were read :

                          1. On the Channel Tuhular Railway.
                    By Sir Edward Reed, K.C.B., M.P., F.B.S.

     After referring to former proposals for establishing railway communication
between England and France, and stating that the Channel Tunnel scheme of
Sir Edward "\^^atkiu provided for taking the traffic far below the bed of the
Channel at its deepest part, thus lengthening the underground route, and adding
to the working charges as compared with a tubular railway, the author said
that it was desirable in the first place to make plain the nature of the Channel
bed which it was designed to traverse. lie stated that for several miles out from
the English Coast the Channel, on the line selected by him, was only about 90 feet
deep, and, although it gradually sloped down to double that depth further on,
nowhere exceeded a depth of 186 feet, from which depth it gradually sloped up to
the French shore. In no place is the gradient even one-half that of the Severn
tunnel ; in fact the change of level is small and so gradual as to be almost imper-

ceptible upon any true-scale diagram of moderate dimensions. ' Here, then, we

have,' the author said, ' an almost level stretch of ground of over twenty miles in

length to be traversed by a railway, and, if it were dry, no mortal man would
ever dream of tunnelling underneath it in order to construct a railway, nor would

 anyone be so insane as to propose to build a viaduct or series of bridges 500 feet
 high across it.' The railway would in that case, of course, be laid along the
 ground, as it is laid over any other stretch of level country. The presence of the
 sea simply renders it necessary to make the railway a closed instead of an open
 one, to secure it against being moved by the tidal waters, and to provide its proper

--ventilation. To provide a closed railway, metallic tubes are employed one for
--each line of rails and to make the structure durable, all the essential parts are

 carefully imbedded in good Portland cement. The two tubes are set at a distance
 apart, and connected by partial webs, so as to combine the two into a huge hori-
 zontal girder of unprecedented strength. This device is adopted in order to make
 each length of the tube structure (which is on the whole to be slightly buoyant)
 strong enough to withstand the force of the tide when one end of it is carried to
 the bottom, the other end being left emerging from the surface by vu'tue of the
 surplus buoyancy. To this emerged end is brought and connected afloat another
 floating structure which is to serve as a pier (when it is subsequently sunk to the
 bottom), and beyond this floating pier the next length of the tube is brought and
connected by large cast-steel hinge-like joints. The pier is then sunk by suitable
appliances, carrying down with it the second end of the first of the tubes just men-
tioned, and also the first end of the second length of tube. In this manner the
tube is paid out length by length like the links of a huge cable, the junction of
          TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                                                                                               759

the successive tubes and piers being eflFected froui within the tubes already laid,

which are in direct railway communication witli the shore. The author pointed

out that the necessity which drives us to the use of water-tight tubes for our pur-

pose is incidentally attended by enormous advantages, enabling us to build our

structures in the ordinary shipbuilding and engineering establishments of the

country, and tow them to their places, thus avoiding the cost, difficulty, delay, and

danger of doing our construction work at the bottom of the sea. The piers -will

stand upon and be pressed into the bottom where the consistency of the bottom

admits of this, but the tubes themselves will not lie upon the sea-bed, but will

stretch from pier to pier, striding over the minor inequalities of the bottom, and

allowing the tidal water to pass both below and above it. The estimated cost of
the work (which depends somewhat upon details to be determined by close survey)

is from twelve to fifteen millions sterling for the whole distance between England

and France, which the author regarded as small by comparison of the cost of such

bridges as the Forth Bridge, which cost over three millions sterling for bridging

5,700 feet of water, the tubular railway being 120,000 feet long. The ventilation

will be an easy matter, seeing that all the trains passing through either tube will

move in one direction, and act somewhat as pistons for forcing out air, the effect

being increased by throwing out wings from the train so as to make it fit the

interior of the tube more approximately. The author intimated that electric

engines will probably be used, but, if not, and if further ventilation be needed, any

one or more of the piers can be fitted with ventilating machinery for forcing the

deteriorated air out through suitable chambers and non-return valves into the sea.
As regards the question of national security, the author pointed out that the oppo-

sition to the Channel Tunnel had arisen from the fact that it provided a subter-

ranean  road, inaccessible  to, and  therefore  indestructible  by, the Navy                                                       whereas
                                                                                                                                ;

the tubular railway could be pierced, and have the sea admitted to it, either by

gun-fire at the shore ends, or by dynamite or torpedoes at every point of its length.

He concluded by stating that a great many members of Parliament, who always

strongly oppose the Channel Tunnel, are quite in favour of his system, and among

these are several of such great influence that he has little fear of his Bill beino-

successfully opposed in either House of Parliament.

2. Petroleum Oil-engines. Bij Professor William Robinson, M.E.,
                                          Assoc. M.Inst.G.E.

The use of ordinary petroleum oil at once as fuel and working agent in the

internal combustion engine has extended rapidly since the successful introduction

of the oil engine by ^Messrs. Priestman Brothers in 1888.

Hitherto, for large engines above 40 horse-power, the heavy intermediate oils

have been converted into gas by means of a yas-producer, and this oil-gas takes

the place of coal-gas in the ordinary gas-engine cylinder. Now, instead of the gas-
producer we find in one class of oil-enfjine a retort, spiral coil of tubing or other

vaporiser, in which the oil is heated and converted into vapour by a lamp or oil-
Aburner.
          mixture of this vapour and air is drawn into the cylinder, and the
--charge is compressed before ignition the cycle of operations in the engine cylinder

being usually that of Beau de Rochas, as in the well-known Otto gas-engine. For

instance, Messrs. Crossley Brothers are making an oil-engine in which a lamp

performs the twofold function ; first, to heat and evaporate the oil in a retort, and

second, to heat the tube-igniter, which is timed by a A'alve similar to that in their

gas-engines. This lamp has a separate supply of oil given to it by a pump and a

current of air from an air-pump. The details of this and several other attempts

at workable engines of this class are still in the transition stage.

Again, in the petroleum spirit-engine there are many air-carburetting devices to

evaporate the highly volatile hydro-carbons which make up the lighter products of

petroleum, such as benzoline and gasoline. The terrible danger and risk in the

storage of these light oils prohibit their common use for this purpose.

In the Priestman Spray-maker and Vaporiser we have a neat and practical corn-
760 REPORT-- 1891.

hination of these two methods, by means of which a sprayed jet of oil is first broken
up by compressed air playing on it in the inverted spray-nozzle, then it is further
mixed with air, heated and completely vaporised by the hot products of combustion
from exhaust led round this vaporiser or mixing chamber, before being allowed to
escape. This might be called a reye?ie?-«<o?-. The oil vapour thus thoroughly mixed witli
air in the proper proportions is drawn through an automatic suction valve into the
engine cylinder by the piston in its forward stroke. The action of this spray-maker

--(shown) will be seen by the following experiment: First, turn off the air supply and

a flame does not light the unbroken oil-jet ; next, allow the air under pressure to
break up and thoroughly spray the oil, the vapour formed is so intimately mixed
with air that it can easily be ignited, and burns with a bright flame. (The draw-
ings of this spray-maker showed the governing arrangement adopted in the
Priestman engine.) The amount of hydro-carbon is diminished or increased, together
with the amount of air, so as to form a high explosive charge or a low one, accord-
ing to the amount of work to be done by the engine. The air through the wing-
valve is rightly proportioned to mix with the oil which is allowed through the

V-shaped slot cut in the conical plug regulated by the governor. By this means

there is a regular explosion and impulse, every cycle giving admirable regularity of
running. (Indicator-cards illustrating this mode of governing with full load and
running light were shown.) The compressed charge is Jived by an intermittent
electric spark, made to play between ends of two platinum wires insulated by
porcelain in the igniting plug (shown), and connected to an induction coil excited
bv a storage-cell of about two volts, which has been known to work for more than
l",100 hours.

     The author explained the action in horizontal engines by means of diagrams,
and gave a short description of a double cylinder vertical launch engines specially
designed for running at a high speed with the centre of gravity kept low. Each
cylinder of launch engine is 7 inches diameter by 7 inches stroke, arranged to give
an explosion or working stroke every revolution of fly-wheel. The actual horse-
power at 250 revolutions per minute is 57, and 91 indicated horse-power. These
engines are working in a small launch 28 feet from stem to stern by 6 feet 2
inches beam, and are giving good results. Speed 7 miles, and engines work
with regularity. These engines are now in use on barges in canals, and also for
deep-sea trawling. The horizontal type is remarkably self-contained, and well
adapted for isolated electric lighting installations and lighthouse work. It is
used for pumping and hauling in collieries, and for rock-drilling in mines; in
fact, its sphere of usefulness is rapidly extending, because it is found reliable and
steady at work, with decided economy of fuel.

     The main object desired in oil-engines is to prevent clogging in the cylinder,
so that the engine may run without attention or frequent cleaning. This is secured
by thoroughly mixing the air and vapour, so as always to form an explosive
mixture which gives complete combustion and clean exhaust. It must be pointed
out, however, that during the compression of the charge before ignition a con-
siderable proportion of the vapour comes into contact with the walls of the
cylinder, condenses on them, and never gets burned, however useful it may be for
lubrication. This the author has proved by comparing the pressure along the
compression curves of the indicator diagrams, wilh the pressure obtained by
experiment from each charge consisting of the explosive mixture -015 cubic inch of
oil and 191 cubic inches of air at the same temperature. Taking the tempera-
ture of the charge 170° F. on entering the cylinder, the indicator diagram shows
the highest pressure before ignition only 38 lbs. per square inch. This pressure
is kept low for fear of much condensation, as well as to give smooth running.
In the gas-engine we know that compression of the charge before ignition is essen-
tial to high efficiency, and similar considerations lead one to expect the same to
hold true for oil-engines. Indeed, by adding fresh air to the charge after leaving
the vaporiser, and compressing more than usual, greater power or higher efficiency
is obtained, but the temperature of the cylinder liiecomes too high for lubrication.
In some published trials an engine may be run with a special cylinder liner to
withstand the high temperatures due to high compression used, but these are not

the conditions for ordinary work. In fact for any particular oil experience must

decide the degree of compression that gives best results as regards power and

efficiency consistent with economy and durability of engine.

The author briefly noticed his investigation of the relation between the pressure

and temperature of the vapours from diiierent burning oils, intermediate oils, and

some heavier lubricating oils, in order to throw some light on the action in the
cylinder of the common oil-engine. At the same time he has tried to find out which

oils are best adapted for this use. His experiments prove that, notwithstanding the

complex and varied cliaracter of the diiierent oils examined, the law according to

which the pressure ofpetroleum vapour varies tvith its temperature is represented by

a perfectly regular curve for each oil. He compared these results with the figures

obtained from the different oils when used in the same engine during special tests

for the purpose.

    By far the simplest type of oil-engine is that in which the oil is injected

directly into compressed and heated air in a cartridge which at once acts as vaporiser

and combustion-chamber. Such an oil-engine is the invention of Mr. H. Akroyd

Stuart, of Bletchley, and is now being made by Messrs. Hornsby & Sons,
AGrantham.
            novel feature of this engine is that the ordinary gear for firing the

charge by heated tube, flame, or electric spark is dispensed with altogether, and
heavy intermediate oil is ignited and completely biu-ned when injected into the

compressed and heated air in the red-hot vaporiser or cartridge. This chamber is

heated up at start with a special oil-lamp supplied with air-blast by a small fan, as

shown in drawings. It was seen by the wall-diagrams that this engine is of the

simplest design. The working parts are i&'sfi and simple, and some details are

being improved by Messrs. Hornsby & Sons. The oil-cistern is fitted in the base

of the casting, exposed to ordinary atmospheric pressure, and the oil supply can

easily be replenished at any time during a run by sliding open the top cover and

pouring in the oil.

     Every charge of oil is forced, by means of a positive action oil-pump, through a
thin pipe and simple nozzle into the vaporiser at the proper moment for ignition,

just after the hot air has been compressed and the piston is on the return stroke.

The oil supply is regulated by a governor, whilst by using a large fly-wheel and
high speed, about 210 revolutions per minute, this engine runs very steadily. The

author tried a 6 horse-power engine during a run of about three hours, using oil

of specific gravity '854, and flashing point 220°r., and the consumption was less

than a pint per brake horse-power per hour. Even heavier oils might be tried,
the hot water from tlie water-jacket going to warm up the heavy oil and keep it

in a fluid state fit for use in winter.

The action in the engine-cylinder is here very different from that in the Priest-

man, inasmuch as there is an excess of air in the cylinder, and this is compressed

before the oil is injected. Consequently, the combustion is rapid and will be com-
plete even when heavy oils of great heating power are used. However, since the

air is dry, and there is no condensation of oil, the cylinder requires independent

lubrication, as in the case of the gas-engine.

   A feeling of safety to tlie public naturally tends to the use of heavy oil, from

which the lighter constituents have been distilled. The author has found the loss

in weight of some heaA'y oils by prolonged heating at low temperatures, keeping

the oils exposed to the air and allowing free evaporation. Known weights of

oil were taken in shallow dishes, about three inches across top, and gently heated

on a sand-bath by a very small steady flame for three hours, the temperature of

the oil being kept constant. The proportions of volatile constituents present in the

samples are indicated.

The terribly explosive character of the hydro-carbons driven off" at the ordinary

temperature renders the safe storage of petroleum imperative. Instead of the
present tank system, Mr. B. H. Thwaite has devised the safety oil-tank. It is

very much like a gas-tank, the cover-plate being kept in contact with the oil and

counterbalanced by weiglits to give only a slight pressure of one or two inches of

water on the surface of the oil. Tlie frame moves into an annular water seal

stand-pipe, to draw off any gas that collects. There is no necessity for the
762 REPOET 1891.

introduction of air to allow the tank to lie emptied, and as the oil is kept cool, and
always under pressure, it is impossible for a dangerous explosive mixture to
accumulate inside the tank.

A4. Steady Platform for Guns, t&c, at Sea. By Beauchamp Towee.

     I propose to describe two important improvements which I have introduced

into my apparatus for securing a Steady Platform for Guns, &c., at Sea, on which

I read a paper at the meeting of the British Association at Newcastle two years

ago. It will be remembered that the apparatus consists of a water-dxiven

gyroscope revolving in a horizontal plane on a spherical bearing, and directing the

action of four cylinders by means of an axial jet, so as to keep the gymbal-hung

platform coaxial with the gyroscope. The gyroscope itself was caused to revolve

in a horizontal plane by having its centre of gravity about ·? inch below its centre

of suspension ; this caused it to act as a long-period conical pendulum. If it
started with its axis out of the vertical, it would go through a gradually-

diminishing conical movement, which would be extinguished by the friction of

the bearing. This acted very well in short waves ; but November before last

I took my yacht into a long sea in the Channel after a westerly gale, and found

that the time during which the horizontal force of each long wave was acting was
sufficient to disturb the gyroscope about a degree. This led me to make the

following improvement. I lowered the centre of suspension of the gyroscope to

the centre of gravity. I made four little pendulums, each 3 inches long, the

weight of each bob being only '6 lb. These four pendulums are suspended from

the bodies of the four cylinders, and press slightly little wheels on the ends of

bell-crank arms on the rim of the gyroscope. They are arranged so that, should

the gyroscope be out of the horizontal plane, these pendulums press on it in such

a way as to cause it to become horizontal. In the old arrangement the end of the

axial jet approached the zenith by a spiral path ; in this improved arrangement

it approaches it in a straight line, and, having reached it, has no oscillatory

tendency to go beyond it ; so that the time taken by the gyroscope in assuming
the horizontal is much shorter than before. The disturbing effect of the

horizontal forces of wave-motion acting on the little pendulums is only about a

twelfth of what  it was when  the whole  gyroscope was  a  pendulum                                           so  that the
                                                                                                           ;

longest waves produce no sensible disturbance. The machine steadies up much

quicker than before, and the slow wandering of the zero through a degree or two

has entirely disappeared.

The other improvement is the addition of what I call the Correcting Cylinder.

It is clear that in the arrangement I described two years ago a certain small,
lagging-behind error must exist, owing to the necessary departure of the centre of

the ports from the centre of the axial jet, in order that the necessary filling and

emptying of the cylinders should be performed. I endeavoured at first to diminish

this error as much as possible by enlarging the area of the jet and ports relatively

to the area of the cylinders, but found a tendency to a hunting oscillation if this

was carried too far. I then constructed the correcting cylinder, which has entirely

removed this error.
     In the thickness of the partition between each pair of ports I made two other

ports, which were merely narrow slits connected by small pipes, one to one end,

and the other to the other end of a doiible-acting cylinder, having a piston held in

mid-stroke between two stiff', spiral springs, the piston-rod having the elevating-

screw of the gun on the top of it. Supposing the centre of the ports to have

departed one degree from the centre of the axial jet, one of these narrow-slit ports

will in consequence be more covered by the jet, while the other is less covered,

and the consequent difference of pressure, acting on the piston and springs in the

correcting cylinder, will cause the level of the gun to be altered one degree, so

that its axis is still at right angles to the axis of the gyroscope.

     Thus a correction is applied to the gun to compensate for any error in hori-

zontality of the platform, whether caused by the lagging behind of the platform
over the jet due to motion, or to a disturbing statical movement applied to the

platform.

6. On some of the Peculiarities to be ohserved in Portland Cements, and on

    the most advanced methods for determining their Constructive Value. By
    Henry Faija, M.Inst.C.E.

     After dealing with the manufacture of Portland Cement, and the materials
from which it is manufactured, the author proceeds to describe in detail the pro-

portions of lime, silica, and alumina which would constitute an ordinary Portland
·cement, and further explains that their degree of chemical affinity materially affects
the quality of the cement produced. The peculiarities appertaining to quick- and

slow-setting cements is exhaustively considered, and, after defining the ordinary

behaviour of cements when gauged with water, he says that any cement deviating
materially from these recognised laws, though it may be a perfectly good cement,
should be used with caution until its quality is absolutely determined by further
tests and experiments.

     The necessity of making tests for tensile strength at two dates, in order that
the growth or increase in strength of a cement may be ascertained, is explained,
and the author makes use of Professor Unwin's "formula for determining the

ultimate strength of a cement in order to compare the respective value of quick-
and slow-setting cements.

With respect to the setting properties of a cement, the author explains that

there are two periods which may with advantage be noted when carrying out a

test                   the  one being  the  ' initial  set,' or, in  other words, the                                             time which  elapses
                    ;

between the addition of water to the cement and its commencing to set, and the

time when it is ' set hard ' ; tlie lime of ' initial set ' being considered the most

important, as it represents the commencement of an actual chemical process, and

that any disturbance of the cement after the .setting or crystallisation has com-

menced would detract from its ultimate strength, wliereas the time of ' set hard

is only a somewhat undefinable period, and really indicates no change in the

chemical process, being only one step towards the ultimate hardness and strength

which the cement will attain.

     The test, however, which the author considers the mo.st important is that by
which its ' soundness,' or freedom from expansion or contraction, is determined,
and he explains that no matter in what time the cement sets, to what fineness it is
ground, or what tensile strength it developes within the limited period of an ordi-
nary test, can possibly he of any value if the cement proves an unsound one, and

that in the course of time it will ' blow ' and destroy the work of which it is a

component. The causes which make a cement an unsound one are also considered,

and it is explained that a cement may ' blow ' within a day or two of its being

gauged, or it may not blow until several months afterwards.'

The method of determining the soundness of a cement, which the author

devised some ten years ago, is              then explained                                                                        it consists in submitting a freshly-
                                                                                                                               ;

made pat to a moist atmosphere of about 100° F., and when set hard immersing' it

for some hours in water at a temperature of 115° F. This treatment greatly

expedites the set and hardening of a cement, and in like manner developes any
blowing tendency which may exist in it, and consequently in the short time of
twenty-four hours the ' soundness ' or ' unsoundness ' of a cement may be abso-

lutely determined.

    The nature of aggregates used with cements in concretes and mortars is also
touched upon, and it is explained that they may in themselves, through being

unsuitable, cause a failure of the mass even when a perfectly good cement is used,
and that, therefore, the user should be as careful in his choice of aggregates as in

his choice of cements.

    Several peculiarities appertaining to old and new cements are also described,
and the author concludes with a reference to the Pontypridd Sewage Works,
which the members attending the meeting afterwards had an opportunity of

visiting under the guidance of Mr. Chatterton, the engineer of the works.

7. On the Compound Principle in the Transmission of Power by Compressed
                Air. By Professor A. C. Elliott, D.Sc.(Edin.).

The heat dissipated in the compressors, passages, and supply-pipes of a com-

pressed-air power, transmission system is a waste product. Under the condition

that the compressed air must ultimately attain a temperature hut little ahove that
of the atmosphere, it is easy to show that the heat waste is a minimum when the

compression is performed isothermally (even were a sink temperature lower than

that of the atmosphere available).

But the practical problem of effecting isothermal compression has never been

satisfactorily solved and, in fact, attempts in this direction have hitherto been
                                                                                                               ;

mainly based on mere adaptations of the old cylinder water-jacket and jet

appliances. But even in cases where both jets and water jackets have been applied,

the compression curve has been found to fall only to a very small extent below

the adiabatic. Amount of heat conducted is directly proportional, other things
being equal, to time and to difference of temperature. Now, the difference of

temperature between the air and the cooling water is zero at the beginning of the

stroke, and increases to a maximum at the point when the eduction valve opens.

We are, therefore, able to conclude in harmony with practical experience, first,,

that to effect anything like complete isothermal compression the piston speed must

be excessively small ; and, secondly, that the rate of flow of heat from the air to

the cooling water attains a maximum value just at completion of the compression.

At ordinary speeds, then, it appears that even with the jet a large proportion of

--the total heat must be abstracted after the eduction valves have opened that is

to say, after compression has been effected.

The author stumbled some time ago on the principle of intermediate cooling-.

On this plan the compression is effected in two or more successive stages by a

compressor witli a corresponding number of properly proportioned cylinders con-
nected by receivers, forming a mechanism analogous, as the case may be, with a

compound, a triple, or a quadruple expansion steam-engine worked, as it were, in

the reverse direction. The outstanding point of difference is that each receiver is

provided with a jet or (preferably) surface cooling arrangement by which the

temperature of the air as it leaves the receiver is brought nearly to equality with

that of the atmosphere ; and there is practically no difficulty in effecting this
cooling, because the size and surfaces of the receivers are at our disposal.

As compared with the ordinary simple system, the result to be expected is

either (a) with the same pressure a substantial gain in efficiency ; or (b) with a

higher pressure and the same efficiency a reduction in the sice of the supply-pipes

and the plant generally. Another point of very great importance is that if surface-

cooling be adopted in the receivers, trouble from the formation of ice in the exhaust

passages of the motors will almost certainly vanish.
    The author, however, soon learned that, at all events, the idea of the compound

(or two-stRge) compressor had been suggested some considerable time previously by
Professor Riedler in connection with the designs for the new plant to be put down

as an extension of the present Popp installation in Paris. But there is no doubt

whatever that he in turn has been anticipated by Mr. Morrison, the manager of
the Marquess of Lothian's colliery at Newbattle, near Edinburgh. The author

has just returned from a visit of inspection, and can vouch for the fact that Mr.

Morrison's claims are well grounded.

It next occurred to the author that, just as the compression-line on the com-

bined diagram could be made up of discontinuous parts of adiabatics hugging the

ideal isothermal curve by the devices of a multiple-cylinder compressor and

intermediate cooling, so the expansion-line of a motor could be made to hug the'

ideal isothermal curve by very similar means. In fact, the compound motor is

simply the compound compressor, as it were, worked in the reverse direction ; but,

instead of intermediate cooling, as in the compressor, we have intermediate heat-

Weing.  are thus enabled to recover from the atmosphere in the motor-cylinders

part of the energy dissipated at the compressors.

The maximum economy is obtained in a compound, triple, or quadruple com-

similar statement applies to multiple-expansion motors.

     For the purposes of an example designed to show the value of the compound

--principle, the author has assumed the Paris pressure namely, six atmospheres
--absolute and made allowances for all losses on the scale that Professor Kennedy

found them to exist in the present machinery at Paris over a distance of four

miles. ^ The efficiency of the system is taken to he the ratio of the indicated

horse-power in the motor-cylinders to the indicated horse-power in the steam-

cylinders of the compressor. The following are typical results :

8. Sinking Wells and Shafts. By Henkt Davet, M.Inst. G.E.

In 1881 the President of this Section, Mr. Forster Brown, read a paper before

the Institution of Civil Engineers on ' Deep Mining of Coal in South Wales.'

In that paper the author pointed out the great diificulty and expense attend-

ing the sinking of shafts through water-bearing strata, and suggested that a
boring might be put down in advance of the sinking into which a pump might be
placed to facilitate the operation of sinking. The water being pumped down in

the boring below the bottom of the shaft the sinking would be done in dry ground,

and would go on without intermission.

The suggestion appeared to be a valuable one.

In sinking shafts and wells through water-bearing strata, on time-honoured

methods, there is not only the great cost, but, what is often more serious, the great
Alength of time taken in doing the work.
                                          single well for town water supply often

takes two or three years or more to execute.

The subject is of considerable local importance, because of its bearing on the

sinking of mining shafts, and it is on that account that the author ventured to

bring it briefly before the Section.

     The problem is simply that of keeping down the water in water-bearing strata

in advance of the sinking operations, so that the excavation of the shaft or well

shall be done in dry ground.

    The ordinary method of shaft or well sinking is to sling a pump or pumps in

the shaft and to lower the pumps from time to time as tlie sinking continues

obviously the excavation has to be performed in water, and if the quantity of water

to be dealt with is very great, a large portion of the work has to be done by the

men working in a depth of two or three feet of water.

To facilitate the work, and to reduce the water in which the men have to work,

a sump is made under the suction pipe of the pump, and it is the keeping this

sump excavated in advance of the other work which is most difficult and tedious.

Then there is the delay occasioned by the lowering of the pumps, and providing

the appliances necessary to the operation.

    In the plan now proposed, the pump would be placed in a borehole made be-

fore the commencement of the sinking of the shaft. The only novelty in the pump

is that of adapting it to the purpose.

It is necessary that debris shall not go down the borehole in quantity sufficient

to choke it up. That is provided against by means of a heavy taper shield of cast
steel surrounding the pump and resting on the edge of the borehole. This shield

is perforated with holes inclined upwards towards the pump to allow water to get

into the bf>rehoIe, but to exclude d<?bris. The shield is made very heavy, and by

its own weight follows the excavation around the pimip, and also protects it from

injury through the blasting of the rock. The pump is made without a foot-valve,

the rod of the bucket working through the seating of a valve which rests on the

.· See British Association Rejjorts, Newcastle, 1889.
TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.        767

top of the working barrel ; by this arrangement the drawing of the bucket also
draws the valve, and should the bottom of the borehole be filled up with sand, it
can be removed by lowering a sand pump such as is used in making boreholes.

     The boreholes should be made to a greater depth than that required for the
pump to provide a space for sand and debris.

     The application of this pump to the sinking of shafts would be varied to suit

the local circumstances, and the geological formation of the strata to be passed
through. Details of various applications which might present themselves are

omitted.

     It is quite evident that in some situations the shaft might be drained by means
of boreholes outside, and this is a plan now being carried out in one or two cases
in procuring water for Town Water Supply.

     It is the usual and necessary practice to provide duplicate pumping engines,
and where two engines are made to pump from the same well, the well must be
very large that it may accommodate two sets of pumps.

     Such wells are usually 12 to 14 feet in diameter. To sink such a well in
the ordinary way is a very long and costly undertaking, especially if quicksand is
met with. On the completion of the well it may be necessary to drive adits to
increase the water supply.

   A --simple borehole is made very cheaply and very expeditiously four 30-inch

boreholes can be put down in a very small fraction of the time required to sink a
12-feet well in the ordinary way.

    Instead of making a large well the author puts down four boreholes to accom-

--modate the pumps for duplicate pumping engines a pair of pumps to each engine.

The boreholes being completed, the pumps are lowered into them, and coupled up
to the permanent engines. Immediately that is done the water found in the bore-
holes can be pumped, and supplied to the town.

     Should it be insufficient, then a small well would be sunk in the dry to the
bottom of the borehole pumps. The boreholes at the level of the pumps would be
connected to the centre well, and adits driven to collect more water. Should the
boreholes yield sufficient water there would be no necessity to sink the well.

     It would be absurd to advocate any particular system of well sinking as being
universally applicable and expedient. This system of making wells and shafts

certainly promises advantages under ordinary conditions; but the advisability of its
adoption in any particular case must be a matter of judgment with the engineer

planning the work.

    It may be of interest to know that the practice of ' dowsing ' for finding water
is not altoarether extinct in the West of England.

  --2. Trials of Apparatus. The preliminary trials were made durinp- the month

of March between the chief telegraph offices of the two capitals, and the following
microphone transmitters were compared :

     The receivers consisted of the latest form of double-pole Bell telephones with
some Ader and D'Arsonval receivers for comparison. After repeated trials it was
finally decided that the Ader, D'Arsonval, Gower-Bell (with double-pole receivers
instead of tubes), Roulez and Western Electric were the best, and were approxi-
mately equal.

     These instruments were therefore selected for the further experiments, which
consisted of using local extensions in Paris and London. The wires were in the
first instance extended at the Paris end to the Observatory through an exchange
at the Avenue des Gobelines. The length of this local line is 7 kms. The wires
are gutta-percha covered, placed underground, and not suitable for giving the best

results.

     The results were, however, fairly satisfactory. The wires wei'e extended to
the Treasury in London by means of the ordinary underground .system. The
distance is about two miles, and although the volume of sound and clearness of
articulation were perceptibly reduced by these additions to the circuit, conversation
was quite practicable.

     Further trials were also made from the Avenue des Gobelines on underground
wires of five kilometres long, and also with some renters in Paris with fairly satis-
factory results. The selected telephones were equally efficient in all cases, which
                       TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                         769

proves that to maintain easy conversation when the trunk wires are extended to

local points it is only necessary that the local lines shall be of a standard not lower

than that of the trunk line. The experiments also confirm the conclusion that

long distance speaking- is solely a question of the circuit and its environments, and

not one of apparatus. The instruments finally selected for actual work were
Gower-Bell for Loudon and Roulez for Paris.

     3. The results are certainly most satisfactory. There is no circuit in or out of
London on which speech is more perfect than it is between London and Paris.

In fact, it is better than I anticipated, and better than calculation led me to ex-

pect. Speech has been possible not only to Paris but through Paris to Bruxelles,

and even, with difhculty, through Paris" to Marseilles, a distance of over 900 miles.
The wires between Paris and Marseilles are massive copper wires specially erected

--for telephone business between those important places.
     4. Business Done. The charge for a conversation between London and Paris

is 8s. for three minutes' complete use of the wire. The demand for the wire is

very considerable. The average number of talks per day, exclusive of Sunday, ia

Weeighty-six. The maximum has been 108.  have had" as many calls as nineteen
--per hour the average is fifteen during the busy hours of the day. As an instance

of what can be done, 150 words per minute have been dictated in Paris and trans-

cribed in London by shorthand writing. Thus in three minutes 450 words were

recorded, which at 8*. cost fi ve words for a penny.

     5. The difficulties met with in long distance speaking are several, and they
may be divided into {a) those due to external disturbances and (6) those due to

internal opposition.

0. The paper enters fully into the technical details by which these difficulties

have been surmounted.
--A1 Lightning.
                 metallic telephone circuit may have a static charge induce!

upon it by a thunder cloud. Such a charge is an electric strain which is released

when the charged cloud flashes into the earth or into a neighbouring cloud. If

there be electro-magnetic inertia present the charge will surge backward and

forward through the circuit until it dies out. If there be no E.M.F. present it

will cease suddenly, and neutrality will be attained at once. Telephone circuits

Anindicate this operation by peculiar and characteristic sounds.  iron wire circuit

produces a long swish or loud sigh, but a copper wire circuit like the Paris-London

telephone emits a short, sharp report, like the crack of a pistol, which is sometimes

startling, and has created fear, but there is no danger or liability to shock. Indeed,

the start has more than once thrown the listener off his stool, and has led to the
belief that he was knocked down by lightning.

8. The future of telephone working, especially in large cities, is one of under-

ground wires, and the way to get over the difficulties of this kind of work is per-
Wefectly clear.
                 must have metallic circuits, twisted wires, low resistance, and

low capacity. In Paris, a remarkable cable, made by Fortin-IIerman, gives an

exceedingly low capacity, viz. only -OGO ^ per mile. In the United States they
Weare using a wire insulated with paper which gives -08 ^ per mile.
                                                                     are using

in London Fowler-Waring cable giving a capacity of 1-8 per mile, the capacity

of gutta-covered wire being 3 per mile.

2. On the Teleplwning of Oreat Cities. By A. R. Bennett, M.I.E.E.

The paper discusses how the extensive demand for Telephonic Exchange com-

--munication, which in the course of a few more years is certain to arise in all large

cities a demand of which no conception can be formed from the present condition

of Telephone Exchanges in this country-- can be met and satisfied. Given low rates

and a fairly efficient service, the time will come, and that at no distant day, v;hen

every shopkeeper, and almost every householder, will look upon a Telephone

Exchange connection as as much of a necessity as gas or water. Indications are

not wanting even now_ of what may be expected when the inhabitants of large
towns come to realise what an important business and social auxiliary a

properly conducted Telephone Exchange is, for in Galashiels and some other

770 KEPORT 1891,

towns there is already a telephone for every 200 inhabitants, the principal sup-

porters, after the manufacturers and merchants, being professional men, shop-

keepers, and householders. If telephoned to the same extent as the town named,

London, with its 6,600,000 inhabitants, would possess 28,000 subscribers, but

owing to its greater wealth and extent it is not only possible, but almost certain,

that eventually London will require a telephone for every 50 inhabitants, which
with its present population would mean 112,000 subscribers. That number would

only represent four times the proportion already existing in the small towns

Anamed,  successful telephonic scheme for London or any large town would

require to comprise several essential conditions : firstly, privacy and efficient

speaking must be secured ; secondly, the connecting together of subscribers and

their subsequent disconnection, and, if required, reconnection with others, must be

rendered rapid and certain ; thirdly, the rates must be within the reach of small

shopkeepers and householders, and should not exceed 8/. per annum ; fourthly,

the system must be laid out so as to be capable of indefinite expansion with-

out the necessity  of  periodical  reconstruction                                                         and  lastly, the undertakers  of  the
                                                                                                       ;

system must have equal rights with gas and water companies to lay in their

conductors underground. All these requirements, excepting the fourth, have from

time to time severally been met and conquered, but no existing Exchange system,

so far, comprises them all, although technically and commercially it is perfectly

practicable to combine them so as to attain as nearly to perfection as possible.

The sanction of the Legislature to the laying of underground conductors constitutes

the only doubtful quantity. The Post Office has demonstrated the feasibility of

perfect privacy and effective speech in conjunction with a system of underground

wires; and the Mutual Telephone Company, in their recently-constructed Exchange

at Manchester, has shown that privacy, distinct speech, and rapid and certain

switching are quite compatible with as low a rate of subscription as 5/. per annum.

The only essential requirement that has not yet been demonstrated is the laying

out of a system so as to permit of vast and easy expansion in every direction, and

this, the paper shows, is a problem admitting of easy solution provided that the

laying of wires is made independent of private caprice. The leading feature of a

cheap, efficient, and easily extensible Exchange in a large town is the division, as

far as feasible, of the area to be telephoned into sections not exceeding a square

mile in extent, with some smaller ones in situations where, as in the City of

London, very grgat commercial activity prevails. In the centre of each section

will be situated a switch-room, to which the wires of the subscribers resident

within that square mile will be led. As some subscribers will be resident quite

near the switch-room and others at the maximum distance from it, it is assumed

that with mile squares the average length of a subscriber's line will be about a

quarter of a mile, and therefore cheap to construct. Each of these secondar}'

switch-rooms will be connected, according to the geographical configuration of the

town, to either one or two central switch-rooms bj' a sufficient number of junction

wires. Such a multiplication of switch-rooms would be impracticable with the

ordinary methods of switching, but a system exists which has been thoroughly

proved in practice during the last nine years, and which is specially applicable

where a very large number of subscribers has to be dealt with. By the aid of this

system, which is known as the ' Mann,' or a modification of it devised by the

author, with the switch-rooms distributed as described, the maximum time for

establishing a connection between two subscribers situated at the extreme opposite

limits of a telephone area as large as London would not exceed ten seconds.

The Mann switching system only requires apparatus at the switch-rooms of extreme

simplicity and compactness, and calls for only a minimum expenditure of labour

on the pai't of the operators, while it interposes no obstacles in the shape of

signalling electro-magnets at the intermediate switch-rooms to the freest possible

passage of telephonic speech. The system is consequently better adapted than any

other for communicating over long distances. Privacy and long-distance speaking

would be secured by the universal adoption of metallic circuits. Such a system

would afford the maximum possible telephonic efficiency, and would enable,

supposing it were likewise fitted in other towns, London subscribers to talk from
                                                                                                          TRANSACTIONS OF SKCTION G.                              771

their own offices direct to the offices of subscribers, not only in the most distant

cities of Great Britain and Ireland, but in Paris and other Continental cities. It

is asserted that. such a system would lead to such a rapid increase in the number
of subscribers thar an annual subscription of 81. would, even in the largest towns,
be sufficient to yield a large profit on its cost, even if all the wires were placed'
underground.

3. Becent Progress in the Use of Electric Motors.

          By Professor G. Forbes, F.B.S.

     In the application of electric motors I have noticed three directions in which
this country needs the testimony of independent and impartial people to assert
the value of applications which in sorae other countries are generally adopted.

--These are: (1) Electric railways, (ii) Replacing shafting in shops by electric

conductors and motors.- (3) Transmitting power to a distance from waterfalls and
rivers by electricity.

   --Electric liaihcays. These are thoroughly established in America on the

cheapest system, i.e. electricity supplied fram a central station by overhead wires.
The extensive adoption of electric tram lines in America, and the small immber in
England, is certainly due to the fact that they allow these overhead conductors,

and we do not generally do so. The most trustworthy estimates seem to vary-
between 418 and 6-00 cents per car mile, including coal, attendance, land and

buildings, machinery, line, oil, water, and waste. The question of repairs is serious
and must be reduced. Most of the lines adopt spur gearing to reduce the speed
from the electric motors to the car axles. They generally use two pinions and
two spur wheels. This introduces great friction. It is very generally accepted

that 8 horse-power is lost in gear friction, though this seems somewhat incredible,

being about 30 per cent. These cars are large, and the motors are of 30 horse-
power. This enormous power is absolutely demanded to enable them to start on
H gradient with facility, and they do this. There is no crawling about these cars.

You feel that there is plenty of power for the work. The noise in the cars used

to be very considerable, and tlie injury to watches through magnetisation was at
one time an objection. The noise from the gearing, especially when worn, has
been deadened by enclosing the motor and gearing in cast-iron boxes. The mag-

netisation of watches is prevented by adopting a suitable type of motor. Another

source of trouble in motors used to be the brushes, for sparking is hablo to be very

violent with the variable load of a tram motor, and the commutators wore awaV

rapidly. Since carbon brushes have been introduced this difficulty has entirely-

disappeared.

'J'he loss in double reducing gear and the wear and tear led to all the important

companies turning to single reducing gear with rather heavier motors. It would

at first appear impossible to go farther, and adopt armatures on the wheel axles

without sacrificing the great advantage of gearing, which allows the motors to be

independently supported without being subjected to the same shocks as the wheel

axles. In spite of this, the Westinghouse Company have introduced a gearless

motor, which has strength enough to stand the shocks. But other inventors had

the idea of fixing the armature alone on the axle, and supporting the field magnet

wholly on springs                                                                                     to  support  it  partially on springs is of little  value.  In this
                                                                                                   ;

direction the most important and promising plan seems to be that adopted by

Eickmeyer and Field. They support the whole motor in guides on springs, and

connect the motor axle and the wheel axle by cranks and a coupling bar, the

cranks on the right and left sides being at right angles to eacli other. This seems

to reduce gearing friction to the minimum, while completely obviating shocks.

     In America spur gearing is almost universal, but in Switzerland the Oerlikon

Company are introducing worm gearing, which has been so much approved by

Mr. Reckenzaun. Storage batteries have not generally been successful in America,

but in some trials have worked very well.

  --Replacing Shaftinij by Electricity. Tlie benefit of replacing shafting bv electric

conductors and motors has been thoroughly appreciated in America. Everyone

                                                                                                                                                          3D2

kaows of the hundreds of motors for small work which are supplied with electricity

by central stations in Boston and New Yurk, besides other places, and of the large
number of electric lifts supplied by the Otis Company with electric motors de-

signed by Eickmeyer. I will only place before English manufacturers two of the
establishments where a statement of what has been done is enough to bring con-
viction to the mind of every shrewd and sensible employer of power. In the great

works of AVilIiam Sellers & Co. shafting has been abolished as far as possible.
The second establishment is Baldwin's locomotive factory, whence from sixteen to

 twenty locomotives are sent off every week, and where space is so far valuable
 that there is no room for shunt lines, and where a 100-ton ti-avelling crane picks
up one out of the twenty, and puts it down where wanted. This fine travelling
 crane, and every other crane in this huge part of the works, are driven by electric

 motors.

   --Tratismission of Power to a Distance from Waterfalls. With regard to trans-

mission of power to a distance from waterfalls, I have seen little to chronicle in
America, and what there is seems rather antiquated ; but in Switzerland important
 work has been done both by continuous and alternating currents. The high ten-
sion electrical work in connection with continuous currents that most impressed

me was what has been done by Cuenod. Sautter, et Cie. Their six-pole machines
with Gramme commutators up to 2,000 volts, designed by M. Thury, seem to
work admirably and sparklessly, and I must here state my conviction, which I did
not previously hold, that the insulation of such a machine can be made perfect,
as there done, by supporting the dynamo or motor on a number of alternate slabs

of vulcanised rubber and porcelain, and by connecting the shafts by Eafi'ard

 couplings.

      I will not take up time with describing different works of this kind, but 1 will

now say something about the use of multiphase alternate, or rotary currents, about
the prospective use of which so much has been published. I have seen the machines
and transformers in course of construction at Oerlikon, and the insulators which

 have been used ; the mechanical design is excellent. I can quite appreciate the
difficulties of regulation of three currents referred to by M. Dobrowolski, but I

think that there are further points upon which information is much wanted. I
 want to know, for hitherto I have utterly failed to see, the advantage of this
 three-phase synchronising alternator over the simple alternators which do such
excellent work. I have been told that calculation shows that Mr. Brown's machine

 has 96 per cent, efficiency as a dynamo. AVell, I reply that an ordinary alternator
 without iron, not having the hysteresis of Mr. Brown's machine, ought to have

a higher efficiency. In the next place I am told by Mi'. Brown that while you

 cannot switch one of these three-phase synchronising motors, with its load, on to
 an electric circuit, and expect it to get up to the synchronising speed, yet it will

 do so along with the electric generator of electricity, if the latter be also started

 from rest. In this it certainl}' has the advantage over the synchronising alternator
 with iron, but none whatever over those without iron, which will act in precisely
 the same Avay unless the motor happens to be stopped on dead centres, i.e. with

 the centres of coils (in a Mcrdey alternator, for example) half way between the

 poles of the field magnets. If this is the only gain over single-phase alternators

 with self-induction, and if there be no advantage gained over alternators without

 large self-induction, I fail to see the merit of the complication of three phases. I

 would not have drawn attention to the absence of advantage, but would have
 preferred to await the experiments before expressing an opinion, were it not for

 the great attention directed to the scheme by the Press, altogether out of propor-
 tion to the results which Mr. Brown and the Oei'likon managers hope to obtain.
 The great experiment about to be tried at Frankfort, which interests electricians
 all over the world, is not to prove that transformation is efficient, but to prove

 that 30,000 volts can be carried along 112 miles of overhead conductor.

     M. Dobrowolski says that whatever load may be put on his motors, there is no
.serious difference in phase between the potential difJ'erence applied to the motor
and the current, and there is no appreciable lag. If this be so, it would be a de-
cided improvement ; but I shall require strong proof before I accept the multiphase
                                                                                             TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.          773

motor as a great advance over the Tesla macliine. The only advantage which it

possesses over sjnchroiiising alternators without iron in the armatures and with

large momentum, lies in its power to start with the load on. ]3ut I do not see

that in large applications this advantage is to he compared with what it loses by-

its want of synchronism. M. Dohrowolski claims that these machines have the

further advantage over the synchronisers that they will not stop when overloaded.

After having tested Mr. Mordey's synchronising alternators, 1 have a strong con-

viction, almost amounting to a feeling of certainty, that it is impossible to put

them out of step in ordinary conditions by merely increasing the load. The more

you increase the load the more current goes through them to keep them in step.

They would rather get red hot than get out of step. They behave just as a con-

tinuous current motor or Tesla motor, or a Dohrowolski motor, behaves under the

People seem to be greatly at a loss to explain why it is that some alternators

work well as motors, while others do not. The explanation is simply that the

former have a large momentum, and the latter have not. I announced this ex-

planation of the difficulty at a meeting of electricians in Paris, last February, and

found that M. Hospitaller had arrived at exactly the same conclusion, and quite

independently. I feel confident in predicting that the Ferranti dynamo, if supplied

with a heavy enough fly-wheel, will he found to work as well as the ^lordey

machine as a motor.

The main conditions that are necessary are :

(1) Every carriage must carry its own store of electricity {i.e. a battery).

This battery must be light, say less than 1 cwt.

No carriage must be detained at any time to change its batter}-.
(li) High voltage lamps must be used to give a brilliant light and economise

the current used.

   --The system described in the paper can be, and is, used with

   A(i.) dynamo driven from an axle, or
   A(ii.) dynamo and special engine on the locomotive;

(iii.) Central charging stations.

In the first and last cases it is necessary to have a large battery in the guard's

van.

Whatever the main source of electricity may be, it supplies the current at a

high voltage (say 50) to light a main system of lamps through the train.
    But as any carriage may be detached at a station to be recoupled on to another

train or break loose or be slipped from a train, it is absolutely necessary to have a

storage or battery of accumulators in each carriage.

The cost and weight of batteries in each vehicle, with E.M.F. enough to light

the main lamps (say 50 volts), makes them impossible. Further than this, it would

be impracticable to charge them.

   We therefore put another system of small lamps, 6 or 8 volts and 3 or 4 small

cells, in each vehicle to light them.

    These small batteries we charge from the main source of electricity on the train,

--and thus they are no trouble small weight and small cost.

The working of these two systems, main and auxiliary, is imder the control

of the guard while the train is complete ; but should any vehicle become detached

from the main circuit the auxiliary lamps automatically light up.

If, also, anything happens to the main source of electricity, the auxiliary system

can be put either under the control of the guard or be fitted to come into action

automatically.

The placing of the main leads through each vehicle, and the couplers used, aie

only two. The circumstances of the case determiue how many through leads
are necessary, and also what the main source of electricity must be.

     In every case, however (except in omnibus trains), we use the double system of
main and auxiliary lamps with main and auxiliary supply of electricity.

     The following Papers were read :

1. An Electrical Parcel Exchange System. Bij A. R. Bennett, M.LE.E.

     The congested state of the streets in many of the large towns, notably in the
City of London, invites reflection as to whether it is not possible to devise means
by which vehicular trathc may to a certain extent he diminished. To avoid
absolute blocking of the thoroughfares, it is now necessary to forbid the collection

or delivery of goods in certain localities during business hours, and trade certainlv
suffers under such restrictions, while warehouses have to be of larger capacity
than would be needed were the free receipt and despatch of goods permissible.

The author develops a scheme by which parcels and small packages may be fieely
interchanged between the various buildings of a town by means of miniature

electric railways laid preferably, but not necessarily, underground, in pipes or

culverts. Such pipes may be laid along the principal thoroughfares, communicat-
ing to the right and left by means of spurs or sidings with the premises of the

subscribers to the system. In imitation of a telephone exchange, the pipes con-
verge at one or more central stations, where operators having sole control of the
trafiic are on duty, and where are situated the dynamos and other apparatus.

The scheme may be worked out in various ways," but the autlior proposes, by
 preference, a rectangular tube carrying two tracli's' or lines of rails, one above the
other, the lower being used for the down, and the upper for the up, traffic. On

 the rails run trucks fitted with electro-motors, deriving propelling current from
 a parallel conductor laid between the two tracks, so that on the down journey
 trucks gather current by a collector pressing on the under, and on the up journey

 by one pressing against the upper, surface of the conductor. By dividing one of

 the rails of each track into insulated sections, the operators, by watching miniature
 semaphore signals placed in the central station, and worked by electro-magnets,
 are enabled to tell on which section a truck is, and to follow its progress out and
 home with the greatest exactitude. The sidings into the premises served are
 connected to the main line by switches resembling those of an ordinary railway,
 which are normally, by means of springs, kept in their position for through trathc,
 but which by the agency of electi'icity the operator at the Central Station can put
 over so as to connect with the sidings. The tracks enter the premises one above
 the other, but if there is room available, they then diverge and effect a junction, so
 that trucks can be shifted from the down to the up line without lifting them off
 the rails. On entering a siding a truck automatically signals the operator that it
 IS clear of the main line, and on running into the premises it is brought up by
 means of catches and springs, which are depressed in one direction only, and which
 also serve to announce its arrival by ringing electric bells, and prevent its being
 returned by error or design into the tube on the wrong track. The connections of
 the motor are so arranged that a truck, even if placed on the wrong line, would
 not move backwards so as to cause a collision. The up track is blocked at the

 sending end, so that, although a truck may be placed on the up siding ready for

 despatch, it cannot obtain propelling current until the operator has a clear road
 for it. lie then electrically removes the block, and gives the truck current by
 which it is brought into the Central. The operators have thus complete control
 over the rnovements of trucks. "When a truck, or train of trucks, is intended by
 one subscriber for another, it is despatched in the first instance to the Central,
lEANSACTIOSS OF SECTION G.                                    775^

where, on reading the address, the operator forwards it to the siding of the con-

signee. Subscribers may telephone or otherwise communicate "with the Central

about despatch and receipt of trucks, but it is not necessary to do so, since trucks

can be delivered into subscribers' sidings, and even unloaded automatically, and

then withdrawn again without any attention on the subscriber's part, while trucks

placed for despatch by subscribers can be brought into the Central at stated

intervals if the operators make it a rule to tap all sidings occasionally for un-

announced traffic. Goods could therefore be delivered during the night, and

empty trucks sent into the various sidings for next day's traffic. If desired,

collisions could be prevented between trucks in motion in the same direction by

automatic blocks. In the event of a truck through any accident stopping in the

tube, the semaphore connected with the section it is on will remain con-

tinuously at danger, and the operator will know that such a stoppage has taken

place, together with its position, and take steps to remove it. For instance, he

could send au empty truck forward, the speed of which can be reduced to a mini-

mum as it approaches the disabled truck by modifying the propelling current until

it strikes against the disabled vehicle, when, full current being turned on, both

trucks can be forwarded to the consignee or shunted at the next convenient siding.

Should trucks by mistake be delivered to the wrong siding, the subscriber would

transfer them to the up track, and return them to the Central. The paper claims

that such a system would prove of immense service if existing between the chief

and branch post-otRces of a city, between railway goods stations, parcel-receiving

offices, and large business establishments, &c. The delivery of letters, telegrams,

and parcels could be effected by the Post Office to subscriioers without the aid of

postmen, while matter for despatch by post and telegrams, together with the

money to defray the charges thereon, could be forwarded by subscribers to the

Post Office. For Post Office work the system would simply be a great development

of the existing pneumatic tubes. Plotels and restaurants could telephone for and

obtain in a few minutes viands they may be short of, and enable their customers to

choose wine not only from the cellar of the establishment, but from those of every

wine merchant on the system. It is not contended that such a system would pay

if constructed specially for parcel work, although the surprising developments of

the last decade scarcely permit of limits being assigned to the possible developments

of the next ; but the author assumes that the construction of subways beneath all

the chief thoroughfares of large towns for the purpose of containing electric light

and power leads, telephone wires, pipes for gas, fresh water, sea water, hydraulic

power, compressed air, and other adjuncts of our complex civilisation, will shortly,

Abecome an absolute necessity.  beginning in that direction has been made under

the auspices of limited companies in some American citit^s, and we must sooner or

later follow suit. Then when that time arrives an electrical parcel exchange could

be carried out effectively and economically as part of the scheme. Our footpaths

and carriage-ways vAll eventually be laid upon the lids of huge boxes, through

which well-lighted pathways, afibrding crossings and short cuts for passengers at

congested spots, may even be carried.

2. The Benier Eot-Air Engine. By M. Benier.

The question of hot-air or caloric engines has much interested the scientific and

engineering world for many years. It has generallj' been admitted that the dis-

--covery of a really good hot-air engine would be of the greatest importance from

economical and other considerations amongst other advantages, boilers, with

attending expense and danger, being entirely dispensed with.

Appended to this notice are illustrated drawings of the hot-air motor invented

Aby Messrs. Benier Freres.  considerable number of these engines are already in

use in France and elsewhere on the Continent for industrial, electric-lighting, and

other purposes. Several have been supplied to the French Government for use in

lighthouses and fog-horn lightships. In the engine illustrated the air passes

through the fire itself directly into the combustion-chamber. With this type of

engine a much greater initial pressure can be obtained than in engines using a
776 REPOET 1891.

separate combustion-chamber, or where tlie air is heated through an intervening
metallic diaphragm. The drawing up of tlie grit and ashes is completely prevented
in the present motor, this latter feature forming an important part of the invention.

    As will be seen by the drawings, the engine is constructed on the beam prin-

ciple, and the combustion-chamber is really a prolongation of the working cylinder.
     The piston (or plunger) is of considerable length, the upper part only being

made to fit the cylinder. The lower part of the piston is of slightly less diameter,
consequently an annular space is formed between it and the cylinder. This space
is connected with the main air-supply, which is controlled by a valve operated by

a connecting-rod and cam-lever worked from a cain on the crank-shaft of the
engine. The air-pump is placed in the centre of the machine, immediately beneath
the beam-standard, and is operated by a rod attached to the rocking-beam, and
this is connected by a rod to the crank-shaft. Owing to the position of the beam,
pump, and connecting-rods, the piston of the air-pump is at the outer end of its
stroke when the working piston, on its return stroke, has reached a middle position.
During the last half of the return stroke of the working piston the air-piston is
pushed inwards, and compresses the charge of air previously drawn in until it has
reached the middle of the stroke, at which moment the working piston is at the
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION 6.  '77

end of its stroke. The air-valve, operated by the cam as already mentioned, has
communicating passages with the air-pump, the furnace or combustion-chamber,
and the annular air or packing space in the main cylinder. Consequently, the
compressed air is forced partly through the fire and combustion-chamber, and

partly into the annular air-space, the flow of air continuing during the time the
air-piston performs the second half of the stroke. Meantime, the main piston
receives its charge from the combustion-chamber, and cold compressed air passes
into the annular space, and practically acts as a packing, eSectually preventing
grit and dust rising from the fire to the working faces of the cylinder. AVhen the
air-pump has finished its stroke, the air-valve is closed, and the air in the working
cylinder is allowed to expand for tbe remainder of the stroke.

     The cylinder is kept cool by means of a circulating-water jacket.
    The bottom of the combnstion-cbamber is hinged, and tbe fuel is coke. As tbe
combustion takes place under pressure, an air-valve, working automatically, is
employed for feeding tbe fire.
     The consumption of coke is about 3 lbs. (one kilogramme and a half) per brake
horse power and per hour.

               3. Oji the Internal and External Work of Evaporation.

                      By W. WoKBt Beaumont, M.Inst. C.E.

     Several of tbe most interesting problems in connection with the st'^am-engine
turn upon the view that is taken of the mode of employment of the heat equivalent
of the external work of evaporation.

    When steam is generated under constant pressure external work is performed

V= PV, P being the pressure and the volume generated. It may therefore, in

accordance with the thermodynamic conceptions, be assumed that more heat is
778 REPOKT-- 1891.

used in the generation of steam under constant pressure than under constant

U PVvolume, the extra quantity of heat being
                   FV= -^=r-, J being Joule's equivalent, and

                   J

U the heat units.

The author suggests the following explanation of the way in which the heat

equivalent of the external work of evaporation is used. If heat flows out of steam

when mechanical work is done by it during its formation, it must be supposed that

steam is cooled by the outflow. If heat flows out and if cooling follows, the cor-

responding condensation or liquefaction takes place, and a further supply of heat is

demanded to re-evaporate steam so liquefied; or, what is the same thing, the

further supply of heat is used in continuously preventing the liquefaction from

reaching moi-e than the incipient stage. The action here sketched is readily con-

ceived if for the purpose of explanation the evaporation and the external work be

supposed to take place jjcr snltuni. Suppose a piston, immediately over the water

in a simple evaporating vessel, to have been moved by the steam through a small

distance A. Then heat corresponding to the work done in moving the piston

A Qthrough will have flowed out of the steam, and this quantity of heat being

gone, condensation-^ must have taken place in order that the temperature T and

pressure P of the remaining steam may be unaffected (L being latent heat of
evaporation). Now before the piston can be again moved through a further
Qsimilar distance A', that quantity must be restored by a further demand on the

source of heat, and if Q' be the quantity of heat required to produce the volume of
steam V, then the total quantity of heat Q^ required to move the pistoa through

Vdistance A' will be Q" = Q' + Q, in order that volume may be produced and the

Qcondensed steam be re-evaporated.
    Now if A be taken as less than any assignable distance or the process assumed

continuous, then evaporation and incipient liquefaction may be supposed to be con-

Qtemporaneous, and and Q,' will be supplied contemporaneously.

     In this way it appears to the author that an explanation can be found of the
mode of conversion of heat into the external work of evaporation under constant

pressure, or of conversion of heat into the work performed by a steam-engine during

the admission part of the stroke, or, more correctly speaking, the work done by
the steam on the piston during admission. If this be a true statement of the
actual mode of employment of the heat converted into the mechanical work of a

steam-engine during the admission part of the stroke, then it follows that liquefac-

tion takes place during adrai;sion, which must be sufficient to represent the
mechanical work done. This being so, the question arises. To what extent will

this liquefaction result in water or suspended moisture in the cyfinder of a steam-

engine ? The outflow of heat and corresponding liquefaction may be supposed to
take place at the moving wall or piston, and in the hypothetic case supposed the
liquefied steam may be assumed to be re-evaporated by the steam or water imme-
diately below, which in its turn demands and receives more heat for its resuscita-

tion from the source. In the case of the steam-engine cjdinder, however, it is open
to question whether the killed molecules in the cylinder or next the piston are

resuscitated by the incoming steam, which follows up the movement of the piston.
If they are not, then liquefaction will take place in the steam-engine cylinder during

admission as a result of the performance of work, although the work is the external
work of the evaporation which is performed in the boiler. The heat required for

evaporation is that of Regnault's tables, but under the assumption here explained
(when the liquefaction takes place in the cylinder and the resulting water does not

return without loss of heat to the boiler), the heat required to raise the tempera-

ture of the quantity - of feed water to the temperature of evaporation must be

added, because in order that one pound of steam may be supplied to the cylinder

as steam at cut off, the extra quantity -- of feed water must be supplied to the

                                                                                          Li

of steam in tbe steam-eDgine cylinder will thus be 1 lb. + i. - when the evaporation

                                                                                                                                         Li

place under constant volume. The heat required for evaporation under the author's

4. On a new System of Screw Propulsion tvith non-reversible Engines.^
                      By W. WoRBY Beaumont, M.Inst.G.E.

    At the present time all screw propellers are driven by engines, which must be
so designed that they may be fitted with all the paraphernalia necessary for

reversing.

   A considerable part of this reversing gear must be at work during the whole

of the time the engines are running. Thus, although it may not be necessary to

reverse the propeller or the direction of motion of a ship during a long run, the
quickly moving parts of this gear must nevertheless be kept at work all the time.
In order to avoid the practical objections to this, and the stresses which are
brought to bear on the propeller and screw shaft by reversing the direction of their

rotation, it is now proposed to effect the reversal of the direction of motion of the
ship by means of tbe propeller, and the object of this paper is to bring before the

Mechanical Science Section of the Association a description of tlie apparatus

designed for this purpose by Mr. Robert McGlasson.
      For several years tlie feathering screw propeller has been in use on a consider-

able number of vessels. By means of this, known as Bevis' propeller, tbe angle
of the blades may be shifted by gear in the screw shaft tunnel, so that they may

be placed fore and aft, and thus offer no impediment to the motion of the ship
when it is desired to employ sails instead of engines.

    By means of the same propeller the angle of the blades may be set so as to alter
the pitch to that which may be found best for the ship, or to suit it for very low
power when only slow steaming is wanted. As employed for these purposes

this form of propeller has been long enough in use to show its practical sufBciencj-.
    By an extension of the application of the principle of this propeller, it is now

seen to be possible to achieve several ends which are considered to be of great

importance. Some of these may be enumerated as follows :
     1. The propulsion of ships by means of screws, which rotate always in the same

direction, and may be actuated by non-reversible engines and screw-shafts.
     2. The simplification of marine engines, by dispensing with all the parts at

present used for making the engines reversible.
     3. The complete and quick reversal of the direction of propulsion of the ship,

without any of that heavy stress which often amounts to strain and rupture of the

screw-shaft, or couplings, or crank-shaft.

     4. The facile adjustment of the pitch of the screw blades while the engines are
running, so that the pitch may at all times be set to suit the form, trim, and con-
dition of the ship, the requirements of navigation, or any sudden emergency

requiring prompt action.
     The extension of the application of the principle of the feathering screw consists

in the employment of apparatus by means of which the pitch or angle of the blades

is always under control, and may be changed from moment to moment with the
same facility as is the rudder by means of steam or hydraulic steering gear.

     Either form of the apparatus thus employed operates by moving in one or other
direction a sliding collar on the tail shaft. This collar is connected to the rod of
levers which gives angular motion to the screw blades.

' The discussion on this paper was given in Engineermg, September 4, 1891,

p. 2G9 ; and the paper with illustrations was published in Industries in September

1891 ; and in the Marine Evgineer, October 1891.                            '

No screw will convert more than 70 per cent, of the power into longitudinal

thrust. Thrust of screw depends on revolutions x effective pitch. Methods of

improving propellers :

2. Forcing water to the centre by ' feeding blades ' on leading side of pro-

peller.

Desgoffe propeller satisfies the first requirement, and shows economy of 25 to

30 per cent, in fuel. Feeding blades will reduce or quite eliminate the ' Thrust

were considered.

ance, more particularly as there does not appear to be any accessible record of an

investigation in this country' of a recent or reliable character.

THURSDAY, AUGUST 20.

The Pbesident delivered the following Address :

It was forty-four years ago that for the first and for the last time I was able to

take an active part in the meetings of the British Association for the Advancement

of Science. It was at Oxford, in 1847, when I read a paper on the ' Relation of

Bengali to the Aryan and Aboriginal Languages of India,' which received the

honour of being published in full in the 'Transactions' of the Association for that

year. I have often regretted that absence from England and pressure of work

have prevented me year after year from participating in the meetings of the Asso-

--ciation. But, being a citizen of two countries of Germany by birth, of England

--by adoption my long vacations have generally drawn me away to the Continent,

so that to my great regret I found myself precluded from sharing either in your

labours or in your dehghtful social gatherings.

I wonder whether any of those who were present at that brilliant meeting at

O.xford in 1847 are present here to-day. I almost doubt it. Our President then

was Sir Robert Inglis, who will always be known in the annals of English history

as having been prefeiTed to Sir Robert Peel as Member of Parliament for the
University of Oxford. Among other celebrities of the day I remember Sir

Roderick Murchison, Sir David Brewster, Dean Buckland, Sir Charles Lyell, Pro-

--fessor Sedgwick, Professor Owen, and many more a galaxy of stars, all set or

setting. Young Mr. Ruskin acted as Secretary to the Geological Section. Our

WeSection was then not even recognised as yet as a Section.  ranked as a sub-

WeSectiou only of Section D, Zoology and Botany.  remained in that subordinate

position till 1851, when we became Section f], under the name of Geography and
Ethnology. From 1869, however, Ethnology seems almost to have disappeared

again, being absorbed in Geography, and it was not till the year 1884 that we
emerged once more as what we are to-day, Section H, or Anthropology

lu the year 1847 our sub-Section was presided over by Professor A^'ilson, the

famous Sanskrit scholar. The most active debaters, so far as I remember, were

Dr. Prichard, Dr. Latham, and Mr. Crawfurd, well known then under the name of

the Objector-General. I was invited to join the meeting by Bunsen, then Prussian

Minister in London, who also brought with him his friend, Dr. Karl Meyer, the

Celtic scholar. Prince Albert was present at our debates, so was Prince Louis

Lucien Bonaparte. Our Ethnological sub-Section was then most popular, and

attracted very large audiences.

    When looking once more through the debates carried on in our Section in 1847
I was very much surprised when I saw how very like the questions which occupy

us to-day are to those which we discussed in 1847. I do not mean to say that there

has been no advance in our science. Far from it. The advance of linguistic, ethno-

logical, anthropological, and biological studies, all of which claim a hearing in our
         TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.                                 783

Section, has been most rapid. Still that advance has been steady and sustained
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

there has been no cataclysm, no deluge, no break in the advancement of our science,
and nothing seems to me to prove its healthy growth more clearly than this un-

interrupted continuity which unites the past with the present, and will, I hope,

unite the present with the future.

    No paper is in that respect more interesting to read than the address which

Bunsen prepared for the meeting in 1847, and which you will find in the ' Trans-
actions ' of that year. Its title is ' On the Results of the recent Egyptian Researches

in reference to Asiatic and African Ethnology, and the Classification of Languages.'
But you will find in it a great deal more than what this title would lead you to

expect.

There are passages in it which are truly prophetic, and which show that, if

prophecy is possible anywhere, it is possible, nay, it ought to be possible, in the

temple of science, and under the inspiring influence of knowledge and love of truth.

    Allow me to dwell for a little while on this remarkable paper. It is true, we

have travelled so fast that Bunsen seems almost to belong to ancient history. This

very year is the hundredth anniversary of his birth, and this very day the cente-

nary of his birth is being celebrated in several towns of Germany. In England
also his memory should not be forgotten. No one, not being an Englishman by
birth, could, I believe, have loved this country more warmly, and could have

worked more heartily, than Bunsen did to bring about that friendship between

England and Germany which must for ever remain the corner-stone of the peace of
Europe, and, as the Emperor of Germany declared the other day in his speech at the
Mansion House, the sine qua non of that advancement of science to which our A sso-
ciation is devoted. Bunsen's house in Carlton Terrace was a true international
academy, open to all who had something to say, something worth listening to, a kind of

sanctuary against vulgarity in high places, a neutral ground where the best repre-

sentatives of all countries were welcome and felt at home. But this also belongs

to ancient history. And yet, when we read Bunsen's paper, delivered in 1 847,

it does not read like ancient history. It deals with the problems which are still

in the foreground, and if it could be delivered again to-day by that genial repre-
sentative of German learning, it would rouse the same interest, provoke the same

applause, and possibly the same opposition also, which it roused nearly half a

century ago. Let me give you a few instances of what I mean.

   We must remember that Darwin's ' Origin of Species ' was published in 1859,

his ' Descent of Man' in 1871. But here in the year 1847 one of the burning

questions which Bunsen discusses is the question of the possible descent of man from
some unknown animal. He traces the history of that question back to Frederick

the Great, and quotes his memorable answer to D'Alembert. Frederick the Great,

you know, was not disturbed by any qualms of orthodoxy. 'In my kingdom,' he
used to say, ' everybody maj^ save his soul according to his own fashion.' But
when D'Alembert wished hiui to make what he called the salto mortale from
monkey to man, Frederick the Great protested. He saw what many have seen

since, that there is no possible transition from reasonlessness to reason, and that with

all the likeness of their bodily organs there is a barrier which no animal can clear,

or which, at all events, no animal has as yet cleared. And what does Bunsen
himself consider the real barrier between man and beast ? ' It is language,' he

says, ' which is unattainable, or at least iinattained, by any animal except man.'
In answer to the argument that, given only a sufficient number of years, a transi-

tion by imperceptible degrees from animal cries to articulate language is at least

conceivable, he says : ' Those who hold that opinion have never been able to show
the possibility of the first step. They attempt to veil their inability by the easy

but fruitless assumption of an infinite space of time, destined to explain the gradual

development of animals into men as if millions of years could supply the want of
                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

the agent necessary for the first movement, for the first step, in the line of pro-

gress ! No numbers can efiect a logical impossibility. How, indeed, could reason

Howspring out of a state which is destitute of reason ?  can speech, the expres-

sion of thought, develop itself, in a year, or in millions of years, out of inarticulate

sounds, which express feelings of pleasure, pain, and appetite ? '
--784 BEPOKT 1891.

    He then appeals to Wilheltn von Humboldt, wliom he truly calls the gi-eatest and
most acute anatomist of almost all human speech. Humholdt goes so far as to

say, ' Rather than assign to all language a uniform and mechanical march that
would lead them step by step from the grossest beginnings to their highest
perfection, I should embrace the opinion of those who ascribe the origin of language

TO an immediate revelation of the Deity. They recognise at least that divine

spark which shines through all idioms, even the most imperfect and the least

cultivated.'

Bunsen then sums up by saying : ' To reproduce Monboddo's theory in our

days, after Kant and his followers, is a sorry anachronism, and I therefore regret

that so low a view should have been taken of the subject lately in an English

work of much correct and comprehensive reflection and research respecting natural

science.' This remark refers, of course, to the 'Vestiges of Creation,' ' which

was  then     producing  the  same  commotion  that  Darwin's  * Origin  of                                             '

                                                                             Species

produced in 1859.

Bunsen was by no means unaware that in the vocal expression of feelings,

whether of joy or pain, and in the imitation of external sounds, animals are on a

level with man. * I believe with Kant,' he says, ' that the formation of ideas or

notions, embodied in words, presupposes the action of the senses and impressions

made by outward objects on the mind.' ' But,' he adds, ' what enables us to see

the genus in the individual, the whole in the many, and to form a word by con-

necting a subject with a predicate, is the power of the mind, and of this the brute

creation exhibits no trace.'

     You know how for a time, and chiefly owing to Darwin's predominating influence,

every conceivable effort was made to reduce the distance which language places

between man and beast, and to treat language as a vanishing line in the mental

evolution of animal and man. It required some courage at times to stand up against

the authority of Darwin, but at present all serious thinkers agree, I believe, with

Bunsen, that no animal has developed what we mean by rational language, as

distinct from mere utterances of pleasure or pain, from imitation of sounds and

from communication by means of various signs, a subject that has lately been

treated with great fulness by my learned friend Professor Romanes in his ' Mental

Evolution of Man,' Still, if all true science is based on facts, the fact remains

that no animal has ever formed what we mean by a language. There must be a

reason for that, and that reason is reason in its true sense, as the power of forming
Wegeneral concepts, of naming and judging.
                                                     are fully justified, therefore, in

holding with Bunsen and Humboldt, as against Darwin and Professor Romanes,

that there m a specific difference between the human animal and all other animals,

and that that difference consists in language as the outward manifestation of what

the Greeks meant by Logos.

     Another question which occupies the attention of our leading anthropologists

is the proper use to be made of the languages, customs, laws, and religious ideas of
so-called savpges. Some, as you know, look upon these modern savages as repre-

senting human nature in its most primitive state, while others treat them iis repre-

senting the lowest degeneracy into which human nature may sink. Here, too, we

Wehave learnt to distinguish.       know that certain races have had a very slow

development, and may, therefore, have preserved some traces of those simple insti-
tutions which are supposed to be characteristic of primitive life. But we also

know that other races have degenerated and are degenerating even now. If we
hold that the human race forms but one species, we cannot, of course, admit that

the ancestors even of the most savage tribes, say of the Australians, came into the

world one day later than the ancestors of the Greeks, or that they passed through
fewer evolutions than their more favoured brethren. The whole of humanitj' would

be of exactly the same age. But we know its history from a time only when it
had probably passed already through many ups and downs. To suppose, therefore,
that the modern savage is the nearest approach to primitive man would be against

all the rules of reasoning. Because in some countries, and under stress of unfavour-
able influences, some human tribes have learnt to feed on human flesh, it does not

              ' See an article in the Edinlurgh Eeviejc, July 1845.
       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.            785

follow that our first ancestors were cannibals. And here, too, Bunsen's words have
hecome so strikingly true that I may be allowed to quote them : ' The savage is
justly disclaimed as the prototype of natural, original man ; for linguistic inquiry

shows that the languages of savages are degraded and decaying fragments of nobler

formations.'

     I know well that in unreservedly adopting Bunsen's opinion on this point also
I run counter to the teaching of such well-known writers as Sir John Lubbock,

Reclus, and others. It might be supposed that Mr. Herbert Spencer also looked
upon savages as representing the primitive state of mankind. But if he ever did so,

he certainly does so no longer, and there is notliing I admire so much in Mr.
Herbert Spencer as this simple love of truth, which makes him confess openly
whenever he has seen occasion to change his views. ' What terms and what con-
ceptions are truly primitive,' he writes, ' would be easy if we had an account of
truly primitive men. But there are sundry reasons for suspecting that existing
men of the lowest type forming social groups of the simplest kind do not exemplify
men as they originally were. Probably most of them, if not all, had ancestors in
a higher state.' ^

     Most important also is a hint which Bunsen gives that the students of language
should follow the same method that has been followed with so much success in
Geology; that they should begin by studying the modern strata of speech, and

then apply the principles, discovered there, to the lower or less accessible strata.

It is true that the same suggestion had been made by Leibniz, but many sugges-
tions are made and are forgotten again, and the merit of rediscovering an old truth
is often as great as the discovery of a new truth. This is what Bunsen said : ' In
order to arrive at the law which we are endeavouring to find (the law of the develop-
ment of language) let us first assume, as Geology does, that the same principles
which we see working in the (recent) development were also at work at the very

Webeginning, modified in degree and in form, but essentially the same in kind.'

know how fruitful this suggestion has proved, and how much light an accurate

study of modern languages and of spoken dialects has thrown on some of the
darkest problems of the science of language. But fifty years ago it was Sanskrit
only, or Hebrew, or Chinese, that seemed to deserve the attention of the students

of Comparative Philology. Still more important is Bunsen's next remark, that
language hegins with the sentence, and that in the Ijeginning each word was a

sentence in itself. This view also has found strong supporters at a later time, for

instance, my friend Professor Sayce, though at the time we are speaking of it was

hardly thought of. I must here once more quote Bunsen's own words : ' The
supreme law of progress in all language shows itself to be the progress from the
substantial isolated word, as an undeveloped expression of a whole sentence, towards
such a construction of language as malves every single word subservient to the

general idea of a sentence, and shapes, modifies, and dissolves it accordingly.'

    And again : ' Every sound in language must originally have been significative

of something. The unity of sound (the syllable, pure or consonantised) must
therefore originally have corresponded to a unity of conscious plastic thought, and
every thought must have had a real or substantial object of perception. . . . Every
single word implies necessarily a complete proposition, consisting of subject,

predicate, and copula.'
      This is a most pregnant remark. It shows as clearly as daylight the enormous

difference there is between the mere utterance of the sound Pah and Mah, as a cry
of pleasure or distress, and the pronunciation of the same syllable as a sentence,

when Pah and Mah are meant for ' This is Pah,' ' This is Mah ; or, after a still more

characteristic advance of the human intellect, ' This is a Pah,' ' This is a Mah.'
which is not very far from saying, ' This man belongs to the class or genus of fathers.'

     Equally important is Bunsen's categorical statement that everything in lan-
guage must have been originally significant, that everything formal must originally

have been substantial. You know what a bone of contention this has baen of late
between what is called the old school and the new school of Comparative Philology.

786 EEPORT-- 1891.

The old scliool maintained that every word consisted of a root and of certain

derivative suffixes, pretixes, and infixes. The modern school maintained that there

existed neither roots by themselves nor suffixes, prefixes, and infixes by themselves,

-- --and that the theory of agglutination of gluing suffixes to roots was absurd.

The old school looked upon these suftixes as originallj^ independent and significative

words ; the modern scliool declined to accept this view except in a few irrefragable
instances. I think the more accurate reasoners are coming back to the opinion

held by the old school, that all formal elements of language were originally sub-

stantial, and therefore significative ; that they are the remnants of predicative or

demonstrative words. It is true we cannot always prove this as cleaily as in the

case of such words as hard-ship, luis-dom, man-hood, where hood can be traced back

to had, which in Anglo-Saxon exists as an independent word, meaning state or

quality. Nor do we often find that a suffix like mente, in claramente, clairement,

continues to exist by itself, as when we say in Spanish clara, concisa y elegantc-
mente. It is perfectly true that the French, when they say that a hammer falls

--loxvrdement, or heavily, do not deliberately take the suffix ment originally the
--Latin mente, ' with a mind ' and glue it to their adjective lourd. Here the new school

has done good service in showing the working of that instinct of analogy which is

a most important element in the historical development of human speech. One

compound was  formed   in  which   mente  retained                           its  own  meaning                                            for  instance,
                                                                                                                                       ;

forti mente, 'with a brave mind.' But when this had come to mean bravely, and

no  more, the working  of analogy  began                                and  ii fortement, iiomfort, could mean
                                                                     ;

* bravely,' then why not lourdement, from lourd, ' heavily ' ? But in the end there

is no escape from Bunsen's fundamental principle that everything in language was

-- --originally language that is, was significative, was substantial, was material before

it became purely formal.

    But it is not only with regard to these general problems that Bunsen has

anticipated the verdict of our own time. Some of his answers to more special

questions also show that he was right when many of his contemporaries, and even

successors, were wrong. It has long been a question, for instance, whether the

Armenian language belonged to the Iranic branch of the Aryan family, or whether

it formed an independent branch, like Sanskrit, Persian, or Greek. Bunsen, in

1847, treated Armenian as a separate branch of Aryan speech ; and that it is so

was proved by Professor Iliibschmann in 1883.

    Again, there has been a long controversy whether the language of the Afghans

belonged to the Indie or the Iranic branch. Dr. Trumpp tried to show that it be-

longed, by certain peculiarities, to the Indie or Sanskritic branch. Professor

Darmesteter has proved but lately that it shares its most essential characteristics

--in common with Persian. Here, too, Bunsen guessed rightly for I do not mean
--to say that it was more than a guess when he stated that ' Pushtu, the language

of the Afghans, belongs to the Persian branch.'

    I hope you will forgive me for having detained you so long with a mere retro-

spect. I could not deny myself the satisfaction of paying this tribute of gratitude

and respect to my departed friend. Baron Bunsen. To have known him belongs

myto the most cherished recollections of  life.                              But though I am myself an old man
-- --much older than Bunsen was at our meeting in 1847 do not suppose that I came

here as a mere laudator femporis acti. Certainly not. If one tries to recall what

Anthropology was in 1847, and then considers what it is now, its progress seems

most marvellous. I do not think so much of the new materials which have been

collected from all parts of the world. These last fifty years have been an age of

discovery in Africa, in Central Asia, in America, in Polynesia, and in Australia,

such as can hardly be matched in any previous century.

    But what seems to me even more important than the mere increase of material

is the new spirit in which ^.nthropology has been studied during the last genera-

tion. I do not mean to depreciate the labours of so-called dilettanti. After all,

dilettanti are lovers of knowledge, and in a study such as the study of Anthropolosry

the labours of these volunteers, or fiumcs-tireurs, have often proved most valuable.
But the study of man in every part of the world has ceased to be a subject for

curiosity only. It has been raised to the dignity, but also to the responsibility, of

--other science such as Zoology, Botany, Mineralogy, and all the rest. Many theories

which were very popular fifty years ago      are                                                                                                                                                                                                        now completely exploded                                                                                    nay,  some

of the very principles by which our science was then guided have been discarded.

-- --Let me give you one instance perhaps the most important one as determining the
right direction of anthropological studies.

At our meeting in 18i7 it was taken for granted that the study of Comparative

Philology would be in future tLie only safe foundation for the study of Anthropology.

Linguistic Ethnology was a very favourite term used by Buusen, Prichard, Latham,

and others. It was, in fact, the chief purpose of Buusen's paper to show that the

whole of mankind could be classified according to language. I protested against

mythis view at the time, and in 1853 I published                                                                                                                                                                                                        formal protest in a letter to

Bunsen, ' On the Turanian Languages.' In a chapter called ' Ethnology vosus

Phonology ' I called, if not for a complete divorce, at least for a judicial separation

between the study of Philology and the study of Ethnology. ' Ethnological race,' I

said, ' and phonological race are not commensurate, except in antehistorical times,

or, perhaps, at the very dawn of history. With the migration of tribes, their
wars, their colonies, their conquests and alliances, which, if we maj- judge from

their effects, must have been much more violent in the ethnic than ever in the

political periods of history, it is impossible to imagine that race and language should

continue to run parallel. The physiologist should pursue his own science, uncon-

cerned about language. Let him see how far the skulls, or the hair, or the colour,

or the skin of different tribes admit of classification ; but to the sound of their

words his ear should be as deaf as that of the ornithologist's to the notes of caged

birds. If his Caucasian class includes nations or individuals speaking Aryan

(Greek), Turanian (Turkish), and Semitic (Hebrew) languages, it is not his fault.

His system must not be altered to suit another sj-stem. There is a better solution

both for his difficulties and for those of the phonologist than mutual compromise.

The phonologist should collect his evidence, arrange his classes, divide and combine

as if no Blumeubach had ever looked at skulls, as if no Camper had ever measured

facial angles, as if no Owen had ever examined the basis of a cranium. His evidence

is the evidence of language, and nothing else                                                                                                                                                                                                           this he must follow, even                                                                                  though in
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

the teeth of history, physical or political. . . . There ought to be no compromise

between ethnological and phonological science. It is only by stating the glaring

contradictions between the two that truth can be elicited.'

    At first my protest met with no response ; nay, curiously enough, I have often

been supposed to be the strongest advocate of the theory which I so fiercely attacked.

Perhaps I was not entirely without blame, for, having once delivered my soul, I

allowed myself occasionally the freedom to speak of the Aryan or the Semitic race,

meaning thereby no more than the people, whoever and whatever they were, who

spoke Aryan or Semitic languages. I wish we could distinguish in English as in

Hebrew between nations and languages. Thus in the Book of Daniel, iii. 4, ' the

WhyOherald cried aloud, . . .                                                                                                                                                                                                                           then should we
people, nations and languages.'

not distinguish between nations and languages '^ But to put an end to every

possible misunderstanding, I declared at last that to speak of ' an Aryan skull

would be as great a monstrosity as to speak of a dolichocephalic language.'

I do not mean to say that this old heresy, which went by the name of linguistic

ethnology, is at present entirely extinct. But among all serious students, whether

physiologists or philologists, it is by this time recognised that the divorce between

Ethnology and Philology, granted if only for incompatibility of temper, has been

productive of nothing but good.

Instead of attempting to classify mankind as a whole, students are now engaged

in classing skulls, in classing hair, and teeth, and skin. Many solid results have

been secured by these special researches ; but, as yet, no two classifications, based

on these characteristics, have been made to run parallel.

The most natural classification is, no doubt, that according to the colour of the

skin. This gives us a black, a brown, a yellow, a red, and a white race, with

several subdivisions. This classification has often been despised as unscientific

but it may still turn out fiir more valuable than is at pre-i^ent supposed.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   3E2
788 REPORT-- 1891.

     The next classification is that by the colour of the eyes, as black, brown, hazel,
grey, and blue. This subject also has attracted much attention of late, and, within
certain limits, the results have proved very valuable.

     The most favourite classification, however, has always been that according to
the skulls. The skull, as the shell of the brain, has by many students been sup-
posed to betray something of the spiritual essence of man ; and who can doubt
that the general features of the skull, if taken in large averages, do correspond to
the general features of human character ? V^'e have only to look round to see men
with heads like a cannon-ball and others with heads like a hawk. This distinction
has formed the foundation for a more scientific classification into brachi/cejiJialic,
dulicltocejihalic, and mesocephalic skulls. The proportion of 80 : 100 between the
transverse and longitudinal diameters gives us the ordinary or mesocephalic type,
the proportion of 75 : 100 the dolichocephalic, the proportion of 85 : 100 the
brachycephalic type. The extremes are 70 : 100 and 90 : 100.

     If we examine any large collection of skulls, we have not much difficulty in
arranging them under these three classes but if, after we have done this, we look at

                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

the nationality of each skull, we find the most hopeless confusion. Pruner Bey, as

Peschel tells us in his ' Volkerkunde,' has observed brachycephalic and dolichocephalic

skulls in children born of the same mother ; and if we consider how many women
have been carried away into captivity by Mongolians in their inroads into China,
India, and Germany, we cannot feel surprised if we find some longheads among

the roundheads of those Central Asiatic hordes.

     Only we must not adopt the easy expedient of certain anthropologists who,
when they find dolichocephalic and brachycephalic skulls in the same tomb, at once
jump to the conclusion that they must have belonged to two different races.
When, for instance, two dolichocephalic and three brachycephalic skulls were dis-
covered in the same tomb at Alexanderpol, we were told at once that this proved
nothing as to the simultaneous occurrence of different skulls in the same family

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

nay, that it proved the very contrary of what it might seem to prove. It was
clear, we were assured, that the two dolichocephalic skulls belonged to Aryan chiefs
and the three brachycephalic skulls to their non-Aryan slaves, who were killed
and buried with their masters, according to a custom well known to Herodotus.
This sounds very learned, but is it really quite straightforward ?

     Besides the general division of skulls into dolichocephalic, brachycephalic, and
mesocephalic, other divisions have been undertaken, according to the height of the
skull, and, again, according to the maxillary and the facial angles. This latter
division gives us orthognathic, jnognathic, and mesognnthic skulls.

    Lastly, according to the peculiar character of the hair, we may distinguish two

great divisions, the people with woolly hair ( Ulotrkhes) and people with smooth
hair {Lissotriches). The former are subdivided into Lophocomi, people with tufts
of hair, and Eriocomi, or people with fleecy hair. The latter are divided into
Etithycomi, straight-haired, and Euplocami,^ wavy-haired. It has been shown
that these peculiarities of the hair depend on the peculiar form of the hair-tubes,
which, in cross-sections, are found to be either round or elongated in dilierent
ways.

    Now all these classifications, to which several more might be added, those

according to the orbits of the eyes, the outlines of the nose, the width of the pelvis,
are by themselves extremely useful. But few of them only, if any, run strictly
parallel. It has been said that all dolichocephalic races are prognathic, and have
woolly hair. I doubt whether this is true without exception ; but, even if it were,
it would not allow us to draw any genealogical conclusions from it, because there

are certainly many dolichocephalic people who are not woolly-haired, as, for

instance, the Eskimos.-

    Now let us consider whether there can be any organic connection between the

shape of the skull, the facial angle, the conformation of the hair, or the colour of

the skin on one side, and what we call the great families of language on the other.

That we speak at all may rightly be called a work of nature, o^pera naturale, as
Dante said long ago but that we speak thus or thus, cost o cost, that, as the same

                 --;

Dante said, depends on our pleasure that is, our work. To imagine, therefore,

that as a matter of necessity, or as a matter of fact, dolichocephalic skulls have

anything to do with Aryan, mesocephalic with Semitic, or brachycephalic with

Turanian speech, is nothing but the wildest random thought ; it can convey no

Werational meaning whatever.        might as well say that all painters are dolicho-

cephalic, and all musicians brachycephalic, or that all lophocomic ti-ibes work in

gold, and all lissocomic tribes in silver.

     If anything must be ascribed to prehistoric times, surely the differentiation of
the human skull, the human hair, and the human skin, would have to be ascribed

to that distant period. No one, I believe, has ever maintained that a mesocephalic

skull was split or differentiated into a dolichocephalic and a brachycephalic variety

in the bright sunshine of history.

But let us, for the sake of argument, assume that in prehistoric times all doli-

chocephalic people spoke Aryan, all mesocephalic, Semitic, all brachycephalic,

Turanian languages; how would that help us.''
    So long as we know anything of the ancient Aryan, Semitic, and Turanian

languages, we find foreign words in each of them. This proves a very close and

historical contact between them. For instance, in Babylonian texts of 3000 B.C.

there is the word sindhu for cloth made of vegetable fibres, liuen. That can only

be the Sk. sindhu, the Indus, or saindhava, what comes from the Indus. It would
be the same word as the Homeric crivbaiv, fine cloth. ^ In Egyptian we find so

many Semitic words that it is difficult to say whether they were borrowed or
derived from a common source. I confess I am not convinced, but Egyptologists

of high authority assure us that the names of several Aryan peoples, such as the

Sicilians and Sardinians, occur in the fourteenth century B.C., in the inscriptions of

the time of Menephthah I. Again, as soon as we know anything of the Turanian

-- --languages Finnish, for instance we find them full of Aryan words. All this, it

may be said, applies to a very recent period in the ancient history of humanity.
Still, we have no access to earlier documents, and we may fairly say that this close

contact which existed then existed, probably, at an earlier time also.

If, then, we have no reason to doubt that the ancestors of the people speaking

Aryan, Semitic, and Turanian languages lived in close proximity, would there not

have been marriages between them, so long as they lived in peace, and would they

not have killed the men and carried off the women in time of war F What, then,

would have been the effect of a marriage between a dolichocephalic mother and a

brachycephalic father ? The materials for studying this question of metissaf/e, as

the French call it, are too scanty as yet to enable us to speak with confidence.

But whether the paternal or the maternal type prevailed, or whether their union

gave rise to a new permanent variety, still it stands to reason that the children of
a dolichocephalic captive woman might be found, after fifty or sixty years, speak-

ing the language of the brachycephalic conquerors.

     It has been the custom to speak of the early Aryan, Semitic, and Turanian

--races as large swarms as millions pouring from one country into another. It has

been calculated that these early nomads would have required immense tracts of
meadow land to keep their flocks, and that it was the search of new pastures that

drove them, by an irresistible force, over the whole inhabitable earth.

This may have been so, but it may also have not been so. Anyhow, we have

a right to suppose that, before there were millions of human beings, there were at

Wefirst a few only.  have been told of late that there never was a first man ; but

we may be allowed to suppose, at all events, that there were at one time a few

first men and a few first women. If, then, the mixture of blood by marriage and

the mixture of language in peace or war took place at that early time, when the

world was peopled by some individuals, or by some hundreds, or by some thousands

only, think only what tlie necessary result would have been. It has been calcu-

lated that it would require only 600 years to populate the whole earth with the

descendants of one couple, the first father teing dolichocephalic and the first

mother brachycephalic. They might, after a time, all choose to speak an Aryan

language, but they could not choose their skulls, hut would have to accept them

from nature, whether dolichocephalic or brachycephalic.

"Who, then, would dare at present to lift up a skull and say this skull must

have spoken an Arj'an language, or lift up a language and say this language must
have been spoken by a dolichocephalic skull ? Yet, though no serious student would

any longer listen to such arguments, it takes a long time before theories that were

maintained for a time by serious students, and were then surrendered by them, can

be completely eradicated. I shall not touch to-day on the hackneyed question of

the ' Home of the Aryas' except as a warniug. There are two quite distinct

questions concerning the home of the Aryas.

    When students of Philology speak of Aryas, they mean by Aryas nothing

but people speaking an Aryan language. They affirm nothing about skulls, skins,

hair, and all the rest. Arya with them means speakers of an Aryan language.
When, on the contrary, students of Physiology speak of dolichocephalic, ortho-

gnathic, euthycomic people, they speak of their physiological characteristics only, and

affirm nothing whatever about language.
     It is clear, therefore, that the home of the Aryas, in the proper sense of that

word, cau be determined by linguistic evidence only, while the home of a blue-

eyed, blond-haired, long-skulled, fair-skinned people can be determined by physio-

logical evidence only. Any kind of concession or compromise on either side is

simply fatal, and has led to nothing but a promiscuous slaughter of innocents.
Separate the two armies, and the whole physiological evidence collected by

page                           while the  linguistic evidence  collected                                                                                                                                      by  Benfey  and  his  followers  will

not amount to more than a few words. Everything else is mere rhetoric.

The physiologist is grateful, no doubt, for any additional skull whose historical

antecedents can be firmly established                                                                                                                                                                         the philologist is grateful for an}' additional
                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

word that can help to indicate the historical or geographical whereabouts of the

unknjwn speakers of Aryan speech. On these points it is possible to argue.

Thej' alone have a really scientific value in the eyes of a scholar, because, if there

is any difference of opinion on them, it is possible to come to an agreement. As
soon, however, as we go beyond these mere matters of fact, which have been

collected by real students, everything becomes at once mere vanity and vexation
of spirit. I know the appeals that have been made for concessions and some kind
of compromise between Physiology and Philology but lionest students know that

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

on scientific subjects no compromise is admissible. With regard to the home of

the Aryas, no honest philologist will allow liimself to be driven one step beyond

the statement that the unknown people who spoke Aryan languages were, at one

time, and before their final separation, settled somewhere in Asia. That may seem

wevery small comfort, but for the present it is all that                                                                                                                                                          have a right to say.         Even

this must be taken with the limitations which, as all true scholars know, apply to

speculations concerning what may have happened, say, five thousand or ten

thousand years ago. As to the colour of the skin, the hair, the eyes of those
unknown speakers of Aryan speech, the scholar says nothing ; and when he speaks

of their blood he knows that such a word can be taken in a metaphorical sense
only. If we once step from the narrow domain of science into the vast wilderness

of mere assertion, then it does not matter what we say. We may say, with Penka,

that all Aryas are dolichocephalic, blue eyed, and blond, or we may say, with

Pidtrement, that all Aryas are brachycephalic, with brown eyes and black hair.*

There is no difi'erence between the two assertions. They are both perfectly un-

meaning. They are vo.v et jirccterea nihil. May I be allowed to add that Latham's

theory of the European origin of Sanskrit, which has lately been represented as
marking the newest epoch in the study of Anthropologv, was discussed by me in

the ' Edinburgh Eeview ' of 1 851 ?

   My experiences during the last forty years have only served to confirm the

opinion which I expressed forty years ago, that there ought to be a complete sepa-

ration between Philology and JPhysioIogy. And yet, if I were asked whether such
a divorce should now be made absolute, I should say, No. There have been so
many unexpected discoveries of new facts, and so many surprising combinations of
old facts, that we must iilways be prepared to hear some new evidence, if only that

evidence is brought forward according to the rules which govern the court of true

science. It may be that in time the classification of skulls, hair, eyes, and skin

Wemay be brought into harmony with the classification of language.  may even

go so far as to admit, as a postulate, that the two must have run parallel, at least

in the beginning of all things. But with the evidence before us at present mere

wrangling, mere iteration of exploded assertions, mere contradictions, will produce

no effect on that true jurj^ which in every country hardlj^ ever consists of more

than twelve trusty men, but with whom the final verdict rests. The very things

that most catch the popular ear will by them be ruled out of court. But every

single new word, common tu all the Aryan languages, and telling of some climatic,

geographical, historical, or physiological circumstance in the earliest life of the

speakers of Aryan speech, will betruly welcome to philologists quite as much as

a skull from an earl}^ geological stratum is to the physiologist, and both to the

anthropologist, in the widest sense of tliat name.

But, if all this is so, if the alliance between rhilolngy and Physiology has

hitherto done nothing but mischief, what right, it may be asked, had I to accept the
honour of presiding over this Section of Anthropology? If you will allow me to

occupy your valuable time a little longer, I shall explain, as shortly as possible,

why I thought that I, as a philologist, might do some small amount of good as

President of the Anthropological Section.

     In spite of all that I have said against the unholy alliance between Physiology

--and Philology, Ihavefelt for years and I believe I am now supported in my opinion
--by all competent anthropologists that a knowledge of languages must be con-

sidered in future as a sine qua non for every anthropologist.

Anthropology, as you know, has increased so rapidly that it seems to say now,

Nihil humani a me alienum puto. So long as Anthropology treated only of the

anatomy of the human body, any surgeon might have become an excellent anthro-

pologist. But now, when Anthropology includes the study of the earliest thoughts

of man, his customs, his laws, his traditions, his legends, his religions, ay, even

his early philosophies, a student of Anthropology without an accurate knowledge of

languages, without the conscience of a scholar, is like a sailor without a compass.

    No one disputes this with regard to nations who possess a literature. No one

would listen to a man describing the peculiarities of the Greek, the Roman, the

Jew, the Arab, the Chinese, without knowing their languages and being capable

Weof reading tlie master-works of tlieir literature.  know how often men who

have devoted the whole of their life to tlie study, for instance, of Hebrew differ

not only as to the meaning of certain words and passages, but as to tlie very

character of the Jews. One authority states that the Jews, and not onlj^ the Jews,

but all Semitic nations, were possessed of a monotheistic instinct. Another

authority shows that all Semitic nations, not excluding the Jews, were polytheistic

in their religion, and that the Jehovah of the Jews was not conceived at first as

the Supreme Deity, but as a national god only, as the God of the Jews, who,

according to the latest view, was originally a fetish or a totem, like all other gods.

You know how widely classical scholars differ on the character of Greeks and

Romans, on the meaning of their customs, the purpose of their religious cere-

--monies nay, the very essence of their gods. And yet there was a time, not very

long ago, when anthropologists woidd rely on the descriptions of casual travellers,

who, after spending a few weeks, or even afewyears, among tribes whose language

was utterlyuuknown to them, gave the most marvellous accounts of their customs,

their laws, and even of their religion. It may be said that anybody can describe

what he sees, even though unable to converse with the people. I say, Decidedly

no; and I am supported in this opinion by the most competent judges. Dr.

Codrington, who has just published his excellent book on the ' Melanesians : Their

Anthropology and Folk-lore,' spent twenty-four years among the Melanesians,
792 EEPOET-- 1891.

learning their dialects, collecting their legends, and making a systematic study of
their laws, customs, and superstitions. But what does he say in his prefHce ? ' 1
haye felt the truth,' he says, ' of what Mr. Fison, late missionary in Fiji, has

written : " When a European has been living for two or three years among

sayages, he is sure to be fully conyinced that he knows all about them ; when he

has been ten years or so amongst them, it he be an obseryant man, he knows that

he knows yery little about them, and so begins to learn."

    How few of the books in which we trust with regard to the characteristic

peculiarities of sayage races have been written by men who haye lived among

them for ten or twenty years, and who have learnt their languages till they could

speak them as well as the natiyes themselves !
    It is no excuse to say that any trayeller who has eyes to see and ears to hear

can form a correct estimate of the doings and sayings of sayage tribes. It is not

so, and anthropologists know from sad experience that it is not so. Suppose a
trayeller came to a camp where he saw thousands of men and women dancing

round the image of a young bull. Suppose that the dancers were all stark naked,

that after a time they began to fight, and that at the end of their orgies there

were three thousand corpses hing about weltering in their blood. AVould not a

casual traveller have described such sayages as worse than the negroes of Dahomey ?

Yet these sayages were really the Jews, the chosen people of God. The image

was the golden calf, the prie.st was Aaron, and the chief who ordered the massacre

Wewas Moses.  may read the 32nd chapter of Exodus in a yery diflerent sense.

A traveller who could have conversed with Aaron and Moses might have under-

stood the causes of the revolt and the necessity of the massacre. But without

this power of interrogation and mutual explanation, no trayeller?, howeyer graphic
and amusing their stories may be, can be trusted ; no statements of theirs can be

used by the anthropologist for truly scientific pui-poses.

    From the day when this fact was recognised by the highest authorities in

Anthropology, and was sanctioned by some at least of our anthropological, ethno-
logical, and folk-lore societies, a new epoch began, and Philology receiyed its right

place as the handmaid of Anthropology. The most important paragraph in our

new charter was this, that in future no one is to be quoted or relied on as an

authority on the customs, traditions, and more particularly on the religious ideas

of uncivilised races who has not acquired an acquaintance with their language,

sufficient to enable him to converse with them freely on these difficult subjects.

    No one would object to this rule when we have to deal with civilised and

literary nations. But the languages of Africa, America, Polynesia, and even
Australia are now being studied as formerly Greek, Latin, Hebrew, and Sanskrit
only were studied. You have only to compare the promiscuous descriptions of the

Hottentots in the works of the best ethnologists with the researches of a real

Hottentot scholar like Dr. Hahn to see the advance that has been made. When
we read the books of Bishop Callaway on the Zulu, of William Gill and Edward

Tregear on the Polynesians, of Horatio Hale on some of the North American races,
we feel at once that we are in safe hands, in the hands of renl scholars. Even then
we must, of course, remember that their knowledge of the languages cannot com-
pare with that of Bentley, or Hermann, or Burnout', or Ewald. Yet we feel that
we cannot go altogether wrong in trusting to their guidance.

I venture to go even a step further, and I believe the time will come when no

anthropologist will venture to write on anything concerning the inner life of man

without haying himself acquired a knowledge of the language in which that inner

life finds its truest expression.

    This may seem to be exacting too much, but you have only to look, for instance,

at the descriptions given of the customs, the laws, the legends, and the religious

convictions of the people of India about a hundred years ago, and before Sanskrit

began to be studied, and you will be amazed at the utter caricature that is often

given there of the intellectual state of the Brahmans compared with what we
know of it now from their own literature.

    And if that is the case with a people like the Indians, who are a civilised race,

possessed of an ancient literature, and well within the focus of history for the last

two thousand years, what can be expected in the case of really savage races ? One

can hardly trust one's eyes when one sees the evidence placed before us by men

whose good faith cannot be questioned, and who nevertheless contradict each other

Weflatly on the most ordinary subjects.  owe to one of our secretaries, Mr. Ling

Roth, a most careful collection of all that has been said on the Tasmanians by eye-

witnesses. Not the least valuable part of this collection is that it opens our eyes to

the utter untrustworthiuess of the evidence on which the anthropologist has so

often had to rely. In an article on Mr. Roth's booh in * Nature,' I tried to show

that there is not one essential feature in the religion of the Tasmanians on which

different authorities have not made assertions diametrically opposed to each other.

Some say that the Tasmanians have no idea of a Supreme Being, no rites or

ceremonies; others call their religion Dualism, a worship of good and evil spirits.

Some maintain that they had deitied the powers of nature, others that they were

Devil-worshippers. Some declare their religion to be pure monotheism, combined

with belief in the immortality of the soul, the efficacy of prayers and charms. Nay,

even the most recent article of faith, the descent of man from some kind of animal,
has received a religious sanction among the Tasmanians. For Mr. Ilorton, who is

not given to joking, tells us that they believed ' they were originally formed with

tails, and without knee-joints, by a benevolent being, and that another descended
from heaven and, compassionating the sufferers, cut off their tails, and with grease

softened their knees.'

     I would undertake to show that what applies to the descriptions given us of
the now extinct race of the Tasmanians applies with equal force to the descrip-

tions of almost all the savage races with whom anthropologists have to deal. In

the case of large tribes, such as the inhabitants of Australia, the contradictory
evidence may, no doubt, be accounted for by the fact that the observations were

--made in different localities. But the chief reason is always the same ignorance of

the language, and therefore want of sympathy and impossibility of mutual expla-

nation and correction.

    Let me in conclusicn give you one of the most flagrant instances of how a whole
race can be totally misrepresented by men ignorant of their language, and how

these misrepresentations are at once removed if travellers acquire a knowledge

of the language, and thus have not only eyes to see, but ears to hear, tongues to

speak, and hearts to feel.

    No race has been so cruelly maligned for centuries as the inhabitants of the
Andaman Islands. An Arab writer of the ninth century states that their com-

plexion was frightful, their hair frizzled, their countenance and eyes terrible, their
feet very large and almost a cubit in length, and that they go quite naked. Marco
Polo (about 1285) declared that the inhabitants are no better than wild beasts, and
he goes on to say : ' I assure you, all the men of this island of Angamanain have

heads like dogs, and teeth and eyes likewise ; in fact, in the face they are just like

big mastiff dogs.'

     So long as no one could be found to study their languaa-e there was no ap-
peal from these libels. But when, after the Sepoy mutiny in 1857. it was neces-
sary to find a habitation for a large number of convicts, the Andaman Islands,

which had already served as a penal settlement on a smaller scale, became a large

penal colony under English officers. The havoc that was wrought by this sudden
contact between the Andaman Islanders and these civilised Indian convicts was

--terrible, and the end will probably be the same as in Tasmania the native popula-

tion will die out. Fortunately one of the English officers (Mr. Edward Horace
Man) did not shrink from the trouble of learning the language spoken by these

islanders, and, being a careful observer and perfectly trustworthy, he has given
us some accounts of the Andaman aborigines which are real masterpieces of an-
thropological research. If these islanders must be swept away from the face of the
earth, they will now at all events leave a 'good name behind them. Even their

outward appearance seems to become different in the eyes of a sympathising ob-

server from what it was to casual travellers. They are, no doubt, a very small

race, their average height being 4 ft. lOf in. But this is almost the only
charge brought against them which Mr. Man has not been able to rebut. Their
--794 REPORT 1891.

hair, lie says, is fine, very closely curled, and frizzly. Their colour is dark, but
not absolutely black. Their features possess little of the most marked and coarser
peculiarities of the negro type. The projecting jaws, the prominent thick lips, the

broad and flattened nose of the genuine negro are so softened down as scarcely to

be recognised.

    But let us hear now what Mr. Man has to tell us about the social, moral, and
intellectual qualities of these so-called savages, who had been represented to us as

cannibals ; as ignorant of the existence of a deity ; as knowing no marriage, except
what by a bold euphemism has been called communal marriage ; as unacquainted
with fire ; as no better than wild beasts, having heads, teeth, and eyes like dogs

being, in fact, like big mastiffs.

     ' Before the introduction into the islands of what is called European civilisa-

tion, the inhabitants,' Mr. Man writes, ' lived in small villages, their dwellings

built of branches and leaves of trees. They were ignorant of agriculture, and
kept no poultry or domestic animals. Their pottery was hand-made, their clothing
very scanty. They were expert swimmers and divers, and able to manu-
facture well-made dug-out canoes and outriggers. They were ignorant of metals,
ignorant, we are told, of producing fire, though they kept a constant supply of
burning and smouldering wood. They made use of shells for their tools, had
stone hammers and anvils, bows and arrows, harpoons for killing turtle and fish.
Such is the fertility of the island that they have abundance and variety of food all
the year round. Their food was inyariablj' cooked, they drank nothing but water,
and they did not smoke. People may call this a savage life. I know many a
starving labourer who would gladly exchange the benefits of European civilisation

for the blessings of such savagery.'

    These small islanders who have always been represented by a certain class of

anthropologists as the lowest stratum of humanity need not fear comparison, so far
as their social life is concerned, with races who are called civilised. So far from
being addicted to wliat is called by the self-contradictory name of communal

marriage, Mr. Man tells us that bigamy, polygamy, polyandrj', and divorce are
unknown to them, and that the marriage contract, so far from being regarded as a

merely temporary contract, to be set aside on account of incompatibility of temper
or other such causes, is never dissolved. Conjugal fidelity till death is not the
exception but the rule, and matrimonial differences, which occur but rarely, are
easily settled with or without the intervention of friends. One of the most
striking features of their social relations is the marked equality and affection which
exist between husband and wife, and the consideration and respect with which

women are treated might, with advantage, be emulated by certain classes in our
own land. As to cannibalism or infanticide, they are never practised by them.

    It is easy to say that Mr. Man may be prejudiced in favour of these little savages
whose language he has been at so much pains to learn. Fortunately, however, all

--his statements have lately been confirmed by another authority. Colonel Cadell
   the Chief Commissioner of these islands. He is a Victoria Cross man, and not

likely to be given to overmuch sentimentality. Well, this is what he says of these
fierce mastifis, with feet a cubit in length:

     They are merry little people, he says. One could not imagine how taking
they were. Everyone who had to do with them fell in love with them (these fierce

mastiffs). Contact with civilisation had not improved the morality of the natives,
but in their natural state they were truthful and honest, generous and self-denying.

He had watched them sitting over their fires cooking their evening meal, and it

was quite pleasant to notice the absence of greed and the politeness with which
they picked off" the tit-bits and thrust them into each other's mouths. The forest
and sea abundantly supplied their wants, and it was therefore not surprising that
the attempts to induce them to take to cultivation had been quite unsuccessful,
highly though they appreciated the rice and Indian corn which were occasionally
supplied to them. All was grist that came to their mill in the shape of food. The
forest supplied them with edible roots and fruits. Bats, rats, flying foxes, iguanas,
sea-snakes, molluscs, wild pig, fish, turtle, and last, though not least, the larvoe of

beetles, formed welcome additions to their larder. He remembered one morning
                TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.                                                                                                    795

landing by chance at an encampment of theirs, under the shade of a gigantic forest
tree. On one fire was the shell of a turtle, acting as its own pot, in which was

simmering the green fat delicious to more educated palates ; on another its flesh

was being broiled, together with some splendid fish ; on a third a wild pig was

being roasted, its drippings falling on wild yams, and a jar of honey stood close by,

all delicacies fit for an alderman's table.

    These are things which we might suppose anybody who has eyes to see, and

who is not wilfully blind, might have observed. But when we come to traditions,

laws, and particularly to religion, no one ought to be listened to as an authority

who cannot converse with the natives. For a long time the Mincopies have been

represented as without any religion, without even an idea of the Godhead. This

opinion received the support of Sir John Lubbock, and has been often repeated

--without ever having been re-examined. As soon, however, as these Mincopies

began to be studied more carefully more particularly as soon as some persons

--resident among them had acquired a knowledge of their language, and thereby a

means of real communication their religion came out as clear as daylight. Accord-

ing to Mr. E. H. Man, they have a name for God Fuluga. And how can a race be

said to be without a knowledge of God if they have a name for God ? Piiluga has

a very mj'thological character.   He has a stone house                                               in the  sky                      he has  a wife,
                                                                                                                                   ;

whom he created himself, and from whom he has a large family, all, except the

eldest, being girls. The mother is supposed to be green (the earth?), the daughters

                                                                                    ;

is permitted to live with his father and to convey his orders to the Moroivin. But

Filluga was a moral character also. His appearance is like fire, though nowadays

he has become invisible. He was never born, and is immortal. The whole world

was created by him, except only the powers of evil. He is omniscient, knowing

even the thoughts of the heart. He is angered by the commission of certain

-- --sins some very trivial, at least to our mind but he is pitiful to all who are in

distress. He is the judge from whom each soul receives its sentence after death.

According to other authorities, some Andamanese look on the sun as the foun-

tain of all that is good, the moon as a minor power ; and they believe in a number

of inferior spirits, the spirits of the forest, the water, and the mountain, as agents

of the two higher powers. They believe in an evil spirit also, who seems to have
been originally the spirit of the storm. Him they try to pacify by songs, or to

frighten away with their arrows.

     I suppose I need say no more to show how indispensable a study of language

 is to every student of Anthropology. If Anthropology is to maintain its high
 position as a real science, its alliance with linguistic studies cannot be too close.
 Its weakest points have always been those where it trusted to the statements of
authorities ignorant of language and of the science of language. Its greatest
triumphs have been achieved by men such as Dr. Halm, Bishops Callaway and

Colenso, Dr. W. Gill, and last, not least, Mr. Man, who have combined the minute

accuracy of the scholar with the comprehensive grasp of the anthropologist, and
were thus enabled to use the key of language to unlock the perplexities of savage
customs, savage laws and legends, and, particularly, of savage religions and
mythologies. If this alliance between Anthropology and Philology becomes real,

then, and then only, may we hope to see Bunseu's prophecy fulfilled, that Anthro-

pology will become the highest branch of that science for which this British
Association is instituted.

    Allow me in conclusion once more to quote some prophetic words from the

Address which Bunsen delivered before our Section in 1847 :
    * If man is the apex of the creation, it seems right, on the one side, that a his-

torical inquiry into his origin and development should never be allowed to sever
itself from the general body of natural science, and in particular from Physiology.

But, on the other side, if man is the apex of the creation, if he is the end to
which all organic formations tend from the very beginning, if man is at once the

mystery and the key of natural science, if that is the only view of natural science
796 KEPORT-- 1891.

·worthy of our age, then Ethnological Philology (I should prefer to say Anthro-
pology), once established on principles as clear as the physiological are, is the
highest hranch of that science for the advancement of which this Association is
instituted. It is not an appendix to Physiology or to anything else ; but its object
is, on the contrary, capable of becoming the end and goal of the labours and
transactions of a scientific association.'

    Much has been achieved by Anthropology to justify these hopes and fulfil the
prophecies of my old friend Bunsen. Few men live to see the fulfilment of their
own prophecies, but they leave disciples whose duty it is to keep their memory
alive, and thus to preserve that vital continuity of human knowledge which alone

enables us to see in the advancement of all science the historical evolution of

eternal truth.

The following Papers and Report were read :

1. The Social and Religious Ideas of the Chinese, as illnstrated in the Ideo-
     graphic Characters of the Language. By Professor R. K. Douglas.

The paper begins with a short introduction, showing that the Chinese ideo-

graphic characters are picture-writings, and that as such they supply an interpre-

tation of the meaning of words as these were understood by the inventors of the

characters representing them.

Following on this is an account of the earliest or hieroglyphic form of the

writing, with examples, and the development of this resulting in the ideographic

characters. These are taken as being illustrative of the ideas of the people on

political, social, scientific, and religious ideas. For example, the importance which

was attached to the qualities of a sovereign is exemplified in the choice of the

symbol emploj'ed to express a supreme ruler, the component parts of which together
signify * ruler of himself.' By means of the same graphic system a kingdom is

shown as ' men and arms within a frontier.' Passing to the social habits of the

people, their domestic life is illustrated by a number of ideograms descriptive of

their household arrangements and relationships. In succession are traced in the

written characters the ideas associated with men and women, their virtues and

their failings                                                             the notions associated with marriage                                                                                                                                                                         and the evidences of pastoral
                                                                        ;                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

as well as of agricultural habits among the people. Turning to the popular

religious faiths it is shown how prominent is the belief in the god of the soil, whose

presence brings blessings, and whose averted countenance is followed by mis-

fortune. The ideas associated with objects of nature are next treated of, and the

paper concludes with references to the coinage of the country as described in the

ideograms employed to represent its various forms.

              2. On recent Progress in the Analysis of Vowel-sounds.
                             By R. J. Lloyd, D.Lit., M.A.

    The object of this paper is to direct attention to three sets of researches which
have recently been carried on by three different observers in various parts of

--Europe viz.. Professor Ludiman Hermann, of Konigsberg, Dr. Hugo Pipping, of

Helsingfors, and the writer of the memoir. Pipping's researches were carried
out by means of Hensen's ' Sprachzeichner ' or ' Phonautograpli ' ' with certain
modifications. Hermann's apparatus is identical in principle, but totally different
in detail.'- The vibrations of a phonographic plate are communicated to a mirror,
and a ray of light is so directed upon the mirror as to record the vibrations of the
latter upon the sensitive surface of a cylinder revolving at some distance. The
writer's researches are based upon an examiuation and partial imitation of the
shapes of the cavities which are created in the mouth and throat for the produc-
tion of vowels, followed by calculation and observation of the resonances properly
 belonging to them.

               ' See Zeifschrift fur Biologic, vol. sxiii. p. 291.
              ^ Pfliiger's Aroliivfur die gesammte Physiologie, vols. xlv. and xlvii.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.  797

    Pipping and Hermann have Loth given their attention exclusively to the sung
vowels. The writer of the memoir at first gave his attention exclusively to the

whispered vowels, but has endeavoured, in his published articles on speech-sounds,
since the appearance of the other writers' results, to bring his results into touch
with theira.'

     The questions about which all three writers are more or less concerned are
briefly these : Has each vowel one characteristic tone, or more ? AVhat is this
concomitant tone (or concomitant tones) for each vowel ? Is this tone (or are
these tones) of variable or constant pitch? Is it (or are they) harmonic,
in a sung vowel, to the note which is sung ? Does the resonance (^or do the
resonances) of a given vowel remain constant in the same individual through the
whole compass of his voice ? If the resonances are plural, have they any fixed
relation to each other ? These questions are answered diflferently by all the three
writers, who nevertheless present some remarkable points of agreement in this
hitherto chaotic branch of knowledge. The writer of the memoir is chiefly con-
cerned with the answer to the last of the above-named questions, believing that
all the leading vowels are distinguished by the possession of two resonances, not
fixed in themselves, but bearing a fixed relation to each other.

              3. Faviily Life of the Haidas (^Queen Charlotte Islaiids).

                           By the Rev. Charles Harrison.

     The Haidas seem to be related from the lowest in rank to the supreme chief of
the nation ; but thej' are divided into certain families or crests, and members of the
same crest are not allowed to intermarry.

    The houses of the old Haidas are square and built with cedar hewn to

the proper proportions with stone adzes or axes, having been erected before iron

implements were known to the Haidas. Some of the houses are built over pits,
which serve as a protection from dampness, from smoke, and from sudden attacks
of enemies. In the centre of the pit is the camp fire, which is kept burning day and
night during the winter months ; and around it the Indians sleep and the children

--play. The Haidas feed twice in the day early in the morning- and after the

day's work is over. They have a great variety of food, and grow turnips, potatoes,
and other vegetables, sufficient to last them for the year.

     Queen Charlotte Islands were formerly ruled by a single king, but now each
village has its chief, whose rank and authority are transmitted, at his death, to a
nephew or some other relative ; but it is impossible according to Haida laws for a

son to succeed his father or even to take his name.

     Infants are left much to themselves, but are seldom either bound to a board, or
tied up in such a way as to interfere with their movements.

     As soon as a girl reaches puberty her lower lip is pierced, and the orifice is en-
larged from time to time, according to her marriage and the number of children she
bears, so that it is really a mark of caste.

     Marriage is by purchase, but the choice is limited to members of a certain sept
or crest ; thus, the bear must marry an eagle, and the frog must marry a whale.
The children always take the crest of their mother.

     There is no difficulty about divorce when man and wife tire of one another.
     The women are very fond of ornaments; the younger ones wear earrings
similar to those worn by English ladies, while the ears of the older women are
pierced in two or three places, and pieces of bone and wood were formerly inserted
and worn continually. Nose-rings are still worn among the Haidas, but only the
old Indians have their noses pierced, and the ring is seldom used except when in

full dress for the dance or the feast.
     The Haidas are tall and weU-proportioned, and are exceedingly strong. Their

intellectual power exceeds that of the ordinary coast Indians. The older men have
no hair on their faces, but the younger men endeavour to cultivate whiskers
and moustachios in imitation of the whites.

    Funerals are eoiulucted with much ceremony, the preparations being made by
members of that crest from which the deceased was bound to choose his wife.
.\fter the funea'al is over ail the people are feasted by the deceased man's nephew,
who then assumes his uncle's title and property.

5. On the Work of Major J. W. Powell, Director of the U.S. Ethnological
                   Bureau. Bij Professor Max Mijller, M.A.

    Prof. Max Miiller stated that he had just received proof sheets of a most

important publication on the classihcatiou of the Indian languages spoken in
America. It is a splendid piece of workmanship from Major Powell, the inde-
fatigable director of the Americau Bureau of Ethnology. The publications of
that bureau count among the most valuable contributions to anthropological
science, and tliey reflect the highest credit, not only on Major P;;well and his
fellow-workers, but also on the American Government, which has sanctioned a very

large outlay for the prosecution of these studies. There is no stint in the way in
which these volumes are brought out, and most of the papers contained in them
inspire the student with that confidence which can only be produced by honest,
conscientious, and truly scholar-like work. Our American friends have perceived
that it is a national duty to preserve as much as can still be preserved of the
languages and thoughts of the indigenous races who were the earliest dwellers on
American soil. They know that the study of what he himself had ventured to
call intellectual geology is quite as important as that of terrestrial geology, and

that the study of the lower strata contains the key to a right understanding
of the higher strata in the growth of the human mind. Coming generations will
call us to account for having allowed the old world to vanish without trying to

preserve its records. People who ask what can be the use of preserving the
language of the Mohawks forget what we should give if some scholar at the
time of Cato or Ctesar had written down what many could then easily have done
a grammar of the Etruscan language.

    Some years ago Prof. Max Miiller succeeded in persuading a Secretary of State

for the Colonies that it v?as the duty of the English Government to publish a
series of colonial records containing trustworthy information on the languages,
customs, laws, religions, and monuments of the races inhabiting the English
colonies. Lord Granville saw that such an undertaking was a national duty, and
that the necessary fimds should be contributed by the various colonies. AN'hat a
magnificent work this would have been ! But while the American Government
has pushed forward its work, Lord Granville's scheme expired in the pigeon-holes
of the Colonial Office. America may well be proud of Major Powell, who would
not allow the treasures collected by various scholars and Government officials to

--moulder and perish. He is a true enthusiast not a man of mere impulse and good

intentions, but a man of sustained efi'ort in his work. He deserves the hearty
thanks of our Association, which Professor Max Miiller felt proud to be allowed to
tender to him in the name of the Anthropological Section.
TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.  /9iJ

                              FRIDAY, AUGUST 21.

     The following Papers were read :

             1. On the Ancient Language of the Natives of Tenerife.
                By the Marqcess of Bute, K.T., Mayor of Cardiff.

    The author read a portion of a long paper, written by him, On the Ancient
Language of the Natives of Tenerife,' a language wliich must have become extinct
not earlier than ]65(). The paper was based upon the materials collected in the
second volume of the ' Estudios Ilistoricos, r'limatologicos y Patologicos de las
Islas Canai'ias,' by Dr. Gregory Chil y Naranjo, of Las Palmas, in Grand Canary,
published in 1889, with the addition of farther matter communicated by the
Rev. Claudio Marrero and Don JManuel de Ossuna, from their own researches, or
collected in the Canary Islands and elsewhere by Mr. De Gray Birch, of the British
Museum.

     The author mentioned the disputed point as to whether the Tenerifan language
was or was not cognate to those of the other islands of the Archipelago, and also

whether the inhabitants were of one or of several races. He confined himself

exclusively to the Tenerifan language, and explained the difficulties besetting the
study owing to the imperfect manner in which the existing remains have been
transmitted to us in a variety of forms of phonetic spelling by different more or
less illiterate Spanish writers.

      Three separate opinions have been maintained as to the nature of the Tenerifan
language, some holding it to be of an American family, some a Berber or African
dialect, and some Teutonic.

     The author discussed at length a set of about seventy words which have known
meanings, comparing them with words of similar meaning in other languages, but
mentioned that a vast number of other words are known which are eitlier proper
names of places or the names of plants or other things generally peculiar to the
islands. He then analysed and discussed the nine complete sentences which are
known to exist and proceeded to give a summary of the results at which he had
arrived as to grammar. He considered it certain that there was a definite article
in t, to which, however, there was often given a modified sound like that of t in the
English termination -tion, and that among the nouns a regular feminine was
formed by the termination -ha. He considered it as in the highest degree probable
that a plural or dual of nouns was formed in -e?«, and that there existed a pre-form-
ative of greatness or holiness in hu-, and a post-formative of greatness in -to. Of
case endings nothing appeared clear, but the author considered it possible that a
possessive was formed for nouns, and personal terminations for verbs, by the addi-
tion of pronominal suffixes, that of the first person being -ec, of the second -t, and
of the third -th, and perhaps of the second person plural -era. He also thought
that the past tense may have been formed by prefixing ta- or tan-, and that there
may have been a conjunction ua.

     Entering upon the question of a Berber or African origin, the author made a
comparison from Basset's ' Manuel de Laugue Kabyle,' and, with regard to the
American theory, from Breton's ' Grammaire Caraibe ' and from Massi's ' Manual
del Idioma General del Perii.'

     The author concluded by expressing the hope that more matter may be yet
obtained, and greater results follow, from a deeper study of that which is known to
exist. He disclaimed the intention of propounding any dogmatic theory of his
own, but the general tendency of the paper was in favour of ascribing the
Tenerifan language to the Aryan family.

     2. On the Limits of Savage Religion.
      By Edwakd B. Tyloe, D.G.L., F.B.S.

     In defining the religious systems of the lower races, so as to place them cor-

rectly in the history of culture, careful examination is necessary to separate the

genuine developments of native theology from the effects of intercourse with civi-

lised foreigners. Especially through missionary influence since 1500, ideas of

dualistic and monotheistic deities, and of moral government of the world, have

been implanted on native polytheism in various parts of the globe. For instance

as has lately become clear by the inquiries of anthropologists, the world-famous

Great Spirit of the North American Indians arose from the teachings of the Jesuit

missionaries in Canada early in the seventeenth century. This and analogous

names for a Supreme Deity unknown previously to native belief, have since spread

oyer North America, amalgamating with native doctrines and ceremonial rites into

highly interesting but perplexing combinations. The mistaken attribution to

barbaric races of theological beliefs really belonging to the cultured world, as well

as the development among these races of new religious formations under cultured

influence, are due to several causes, which it is the object of this paper to examine.

(1)  Direct adoption from foreign teachers                                                                                                                                                                            (2)  the exaggeration of genuine native
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

deities of a lower order into a God or Devil                                                                                                                                                                          (3)  the  conversion  of native words,
                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

denoting a whole class of minor spiritual beings, such as ghosts or demons, into

individual names, alleged to be those of a Supreme Good Deity or a rival Evil

Deity. Detailed criticism of the names and descriptions of such beings in accounts

of the religious of native tribes of America and Australasia was adduced, giving

in many cases direct proof of the beliefs in question being borrowed or developed

under foreign influence, and thus strengthening the writer's view that they, and

ideas related to them, form no original part of the religion of the lower races. The

problems involved are, however, of great difficulty, the only hope of their full

solution in many cases lying in the researches of anthropologists and philologists

minutely acquainted w;ith the culture and languages                                                                                                                                                                             of the  districts                                        while such

researches will require to be carried out without delay, before important evidence,

etill available, has disappeared.

                           3. ' Gouvade.' By H. Ling Roth.

      Couvade is the name of the curious custom which orders that when a child is

"born the father takes to his sleeping corner and behaves as though he had brought
forth. The origin of the word is French, from couiier to hatch. To Europeans the
custom appears barbarous in its treatment of the wife, who has to get up and go

about her usual duties and perhaps now attend to the husband. Savage women
 do not suffer in labour to the same extent as the more civilised women do ; the

reasons for this are explained on physiological grounds. In this inquiry the suffer-

ings of the wornen may therefore be neglected. The geographical distribution of
the custom : it is met with in Europe, Asia, and mostly in America. Its existence
in Africa is doubtfid. In the West Indies and South America at the present day
travellers frequently come across it as a living custom. In AuBtralia it is unknown.
It is mostly found to exist amongst people who live in isolated districts and who
appear to have been driven from more fruitful lands. It is not found amongst the

lowest class of savages nor amongst the highly civilised. Comparisons between
the state of the large continents do not explain the causes of its distribution, but
an ethnological examination will probably explain it. The reasons for practising
the custom given by the people themselves and the explanations given by anthro-
pologists and travellers are all equally at variance. Bachofen's original theory
that the custom indicates the turning point in society from the maternal to the
paternal finds new support at the present, day. The apparent correctness of this

theory is most convincing. But if this theory be correct why is the custom not

found in Australia, where the great society change is going on at the present

day? Mr. im Thurn suggests that we should compare the custom with those
apparently allied to it, and so get at its origin. The custom as practised by
                   TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.                               801

savages briefly summarised iu a table shows that the savage believes that there is

some hiddeu link which binds the new-born child to its father. Many curious
beliefs are met with among the uncivilised showing similar belief in occult links or

bonds or lines of force. These forms of belief are usually described under the
general heading of loitchcraft. Similarly in the custom of couvade the action of

the father is to avoid bewitching his child, so that the custom, if not wholly an
explanation of the change of mother right to father right, may be in effect an
example of an aberrant form of reasoning.

4. On the ' Morong ' and other Customs of the Natives of Assam.
                               By S. B. Peal.

The author shows that the institution of the ' Morong,' or club-house for the

unmarried of both sexes, is very widely distributed over the whole of the Indo-

Pacitic region ; and he argues that it is in fact a relic of pre-marriage communism.
But this custom being so often found associated with others of a distinctly non-

Aryan character, such as juming, tattooing, blackening the teeth, building on piles,

head-hunting, &c., has led the author to suspect former racial affinity, even among

such widely distinct types as Papuan and Mongol, Dravidian and Sawaiori.
     1. The artificial blackening of the teeth is a fashion common amongst the Indo-

Mongoloids and Bengalese ; and there can be little doubt that the custom in some
way preserves the teeth from decay.

2. The dislike of milk among the races bordering Assam is very general, possibly

almost universal.

'3. The extension of the ear-lobes, by large plugs of various sorts, is a well-

known custom of all these races. The Miribelles have the largest ear-plugs of any

tribes in or about Assam ; they are made of silver, and not unlike napkin rings, 2 or

2^ inches in diameter by 1 inch in depth, the outside being closed by a large

chased disc. The extended lobe passes round the ring in a wide shallow groove,

like a band of vulcanised rubber.

r 4. Numeral affixes are found in Assam, as among the Malays.

     5. Head hunting seems to be slowly dying out amongst the most eastern Nogas,
and to the west of Dikhu River ; but in most Noga tribes the young men cannot

be tattooed until they have got or actively assisted in getting a head, hands, or

feet of some Noga, not of their own or of a friendly tribe.

6. Tattooing in some tribes is on the face, in others on the body, and it is in

some way a record of the numbers killed.
    7. Platform burial is general amongst the Nogas of East Assam for men and

adult women ; it also prevails in Formosa, New Guinea, Borneo, Solomon Islands,
New Britain, and amongst Lushais.

    8. Communal houses of great length, 100 and 200 feet, are common in and

around Assam ; similar houses are found among the Dyaks of Borneo over 500 feet

in length.

9. Barracks for the unmarried young men, and occasionally also for girls, are

common in and around Assam, among non-Aryan races. The institution is here

seen in various stages of decline or transition. In the case of ' head hunters ' the

young men's barracks are invariably ffiuirdhouses at the entrances to the village,
and those on guard day and night keep tally of the men who leave or return.

They are also guest and council houses ; they contain skull trophies and the large

war drums, In all cases there seem to be old and peculiar laws attaching to them,

and in many instances they issue orders to the village. All these houses are

strictly tabu to married women.

    10. Pile dwellings are a leading feature among most of the hill races about
Assam, and the custom extends all down the peninsula, and throughout the

archipelago, to the Solomon Islands in the south and Formosa in the north. The

pattern of these pile dwellings no doubt varies greatlj , but there is a unity in the

general plan which cannot be accidental.
    11. The peculiar doulle-cyUnder bellows, common in Burmah, Sumatra, Java,

Madagascar, and the Philippines, is also used in and around Eastern Assam.

--802 REPORT 1891.

12. Bamboos pegged to a tall tree stem as a ladder are used in Assam and by

the Dyaks of Borneo.

New13. The ' jew's-harp ' of       Britain, seen also in the Philippines, is very

common in the hills of Assam.
   14. The periniBal bandage of New Guinea is also common amongst the Eastern

Nogas.

    15. Nose-plugs, as in New Guinea, are seen among the Noga women.

16. Flat wooden discs on the posts of houses, to keep out rats and niice, abso-

lutely identical with those seen in NewBritain, are also frequently met with in Assam.

17. The hide cuirasses seen in the island of Nias, west of Sumatra, and cut

from a single skin, are an almost exact counterpart of those occasionally seen

among Nogas, and are both spear and arrow proof.
    18. Panjis or bamboo spikes, planted for defence in pathways, are as common

in Assam as among the inhabitants of New Guinea, and form another link in the long

chain of evidence which tends to prove that the Papuan and Mongoloid are

descended from a common stock.

19. Hot stone cooking again is common in Assam as among the Papuans and

other races.

20. The custom of obtaining fire by means of a long piece of cane passed under

a dry log and pulled alternately by the right and left hand, so as to ignite some

tinder placed in a hollow underneath, is absolutely identical amongst Nogas,

Papuans, and the Dyaks of Borneo.

     21. The huge canoe war drums appear to be the same as the ' Lali ' or canoe

drums of the Fiji Islands, and both are placed in semi-sacred houses, the Noga

mdrums being the ' Morongs.' The notable feature in these last being that they

are veritable canoes, 20 to SO feet long by 2i or 3 feet beam, hollowed out of a
tree stem, and in use by races who never enter, and in most cases have not seen a

canoe for ages.

    22. Cane bridges identical with those seen in New Guinea are found everywhere

round Assam.

    23. The system of Jum cultivation is pursued in and round Assam by most of
the non-Aryan races in much the same way as amongst the wilder races of the

Indo-Pacific region.

    24. The way in which Nogas and other hillmen notch footholds to ascend a
tall tree is absolutely identical with the custom of certain tribes in Australia, who

use stone axes.

5. Burial Customs of New Britain. By the Rev. B. Danks.

The grave is usually dug in the house the deceased inhabited while alive, or a

light structure is erected over the grave to protect it from the rain. It is gene-

rally not more than eighteen inches or two feet deep, and it is the custom for the

women of the family, and sometimes the men, to sleep upon it for a considerable

Atime after the burial.  fire is also very often lighted upon or by the side of it,

which is kept burning day and night for some time. Sppietimes the grave is dug

out in the open and fenced round with bamboos, the enclosure being kept in good

order by the friends, who plant beautiful shrubs about it. They have also a

method of calling to mind the circumstances and mode of death suffered by the

departed by means of rude images cut out of the banana stem. Some have a piece

of wood suspended from the neck; others have pieces of bamboo thrust into

various parts of the body ; another may have a rudely fashioned tomahawk driven
deeply into it. The first shows that the individual represented has been clubbed,

the second speared, the third tomahawked. The old men then instruct the young

people in these matters, and this does much to promote blood-feuds.

Death is always the result of witchcraft, and details are given in the paper of

the manner in which the person who has caused the death is discovered.

Sometimes a body is buried in a canoe set on poles, and the author gives a full

description of a burial of this kind which took place on Duke of York Island, and

was witnessed by the narrator.

     Large quantities of food and property of various kinds are destroyed by the

mourners, excessive grief being proved by excessive destruction ; and all who
come to a funeral are rewarded by a present of shell-money and food. I'emale

mourners are always present, and are well paid for weeping.

    In some parts of New Ireland the dead are buried in the sea.

                                 1. Barbaric Elements in Ancient Greece and Italy.

                                         By Prof. Gr. Hartwell-Jones, M.A.

      The civilisation of Greece and Italy, which saved Europe from stagnation on both
"sides, is valuable for the study of the growth of institutions ; it was evolved slowly
 from an original barbarism. But, as the classics are now read, their scientific value

is obscured.

     Their history occupies a peculiar position : («) geographically, they were
influenced by two streams of culture converging, the Aryan and Eastern; {b)
their growth was parallel (c) both were similarly, but indepen(^ently, afiected by

                                                                                                                         ;

immediate neighbours.

    (i.) Whatever may be the truth about the seat of the Aryans, first they came
south by land ; secondly they brought with them a high capacity for development,

but were certainly not as advanced as Gobineau assumed.
     (ii.) They were both afiected by Asia Minor, Assyria, and Egypt, the North

Semitic races being their intermediaries.

The materials for reconstructing prehistoric society must be sought in archaeo-

logy, and uomology, as much as the science of language, this was seen by Hehn.

The purpose of this paper is to show by means of a few specimens the anthro-

pological value of the classics, aided by the excavations of Schliemann, Helbig,

Chierici, &c., and Sanskrit literatm'e, in the (i.) material and social, (ii.) mytho-

logical and religious aspects of Greek and Italian life.

tural ; but the transition was gradual. The animals hunted were the stag, bison, and

probably the horse ;                       they used the                                                                                  fire-drill ;  fishing was a recent   invention                                               religion

not known in the holoethnic period. Some tribes remained at the agricultural

stage throughout ; others, e.g. the Dorians, retained their old passion. The pile-

essentially agricultural ; the transition in Italy is reflected in legend. The first

plough was the branch of a tree. TUlage was practised before horticulture.

(II.) The crudest form of their religion is                                                It may be divided into (a)
A. Animism, really a primitive philosophy.

spiritism, {b) fetishism. In both the spirit is cajoled or overcome by magic. No-
vyhere is the power of abstraction stronger than in Italy, to some extent owino: to

the influence of Etruria ; the fear of these nebulous impersonal spirits and ill-omened

plants was common ; the fetish was widely distributed, e.g. the oracle of Pelasgian

Dodona, a kind of instinctive meteorology. Further, animism was (a) vague, and

(b) hypocritical.

B. Naturalism characterises Greek mythology especially. At this stage those

objects were chosen which bore some resemblance to man and promoted his welfare.

--Magic gradually disappears, but the spirit is not omnipotent he even betrays weak-

ness. Environment exerts an important influence here, e.g. in Etruria and Greece.

A kind of totemism frequently occurs, e.g. the Hera-idols of the megalithic tombs of

Mycense. Ovid's ' Metamorphoses ' was an attempt to account for the impersona-

tion.

     C. Anthropomorphism is a nobler and more intellectual form of worship,
with which idolatry is closely connected : in Greece, which was influenced by

Phoenician art, it reached its  perfection                                                 in Italy it remained an exotic in spite of
                                                                                        ;

Etruscan artists.

Thus their religion was (a) developmental, {b) acquisitive.
It would be seen upon examination that

(1) Their primitive culture was on the level of that of many savage races of the

present time.

(2) The civilisation of Aryan Europe, as a whole, begins with contact with

the East.

(3) The criteria must be sought in other prehistoric sciences, not philology

alone.

(4) Their civilisation is of paramount interest to anthropologists.

              2. The Morocco Berhers. Btj J. B. Budgett Meakin.'

    The people from whom Barbary takes its name occupy the mountain fastnesses

of the whole of the northern coast of Africa. Notwithstanding the numerous
invaders who have from time to time swept through the land, these hardy people
still retain their racial characteristics, language, and customs in a comparative state
of purity. They have, however, embraced Mohammedanism, in consequence of which
their language has become largely adulterated with Arabic, and many new cus-
toms have been introduced. In Morocco the Berbers have to a great extent main-
tained their independence, and military expeditions are undertaken annually to
control one section or another. Their weakness is their inter-tribal rivalry. The
methods of self-rule employed in the independent districts vary considerably, in-
cluding representative assemblies, hereditary autocrats, and a species of combina-

tion of these two. Among themselves there is always warfare, and every traveller
must be protected by some member of the tribe he is visiting.

     It is still a moot point whether the Berber language should be classed as
Hamitic or Semitic. Though the construction, both of words and sentences,
resembles the Semitic, its vocabulary is entirely distinct from that group. In most
parts Arabic words have been introduced in great numbers. It has, however, no
literature. Only one or two works are known to have been written in it, and
those in Arabic characters. Its own characters are only to be found in inscrip-
tions, which are very scarce, and hardly known in Morocco. The word Berber
itself is of disputed origin, and, though used by some sections of the people, does
not to them represent the whole.

     The Berbers are essentially warlike, and are proud of their bravery and independ-
ence. Cowardice is to them a heinous crime. In most other points each tribe

                      ' For some years acting editor of The Times of 3forocco.
TRANSACTIONS Oil' SECTION H.  805

 differs from its neighbour. No description entirely applies to more than one dis-
trict, thoug-h much will be common to many. Some are religious, others indiffe-

rent ; some are steeped in ignorance, while in others even the women learn to read.

ADress and food difl'er everywhere remarkably, as also do minor social customs.

pall of gross superstition, nevertheless, casts its gloom over all alike. The physical
features of the Berbers are, on the whole, good. They are strong and wiry, with
much more energy than the Arab, or the mingled race of the plains. As a rule,
they are well-knit, and many have fine, noble figures. Their countenances are
often striking, and their looks keen and full of intelligence, though in cases de-
bauchery wrecks the system at an early age, but not so often as in the towns.
Their longevity is also greater, and their powers of endurance are wonderful.

      Their hospitality, if not so profuse as that of the Arab, is sufficiently extensive,

and regular systems for the entertainment of travellers are in force. Monogamy is
more common than polygamy. Drunkenness prevails in some districts, but the
use of strong drink at all is looked upon as a vice. Marriage customs are peculiar.
In some places the women are practically sold by auction on the market once a
year, and may be divorced by being brought back there on the anniversaiy. In-
termarriage among the tribes is permissible, but not general. The Mohammedan

laws as to the bar of relationship hold good throughout. Punishments are not,
as a rule, severe, though great sulieving is often inflicted upon the victims of
powerful members of the community by imprisonment in dungeons, and by the

bastiiiado. Criminals are subject to the lex talionis, which, as the source of the

vendetta, leads to much bloodshed and loss of life.

     The chief festivals are those of Islam, though several have survived from a pre-
vious creed, of which little is now really known. Some of these would pomt to a
Christian origin, and many perceive traces of this faith among their superstitions.
The festival of Midsummer (St. John's Day) is regularly observed, and it is a note-
worthy fact that the European calendar, old style, is still employed among them.

     The dress varies as much in the difierent localities as do the customs. In the
interior it is almost entirely of wool, usually unsewn, made of one piece and knotted.

A toga-like white blanket serves as overmantle. The most curious garment is a

black goat-hair waterproof hooded cloak, with an assegai-shaped yellow patch
behind. The manufactures, if rude in some parts, in others show a considerable
degree of taste, as also does the ornamentation of many of their buildings. Their

food is of the simplest, mostly consisting of cereals, meat being a comparative luxury.
Smoking is common in many parts, and the elderly men are often much given to

snuffing. Hemp is much used in the northern districts as a narcotic, with very

bad results.

     The houses of the people are as varied as their dress. It is believed that they

were originally nomads, and to-day they occupy tent, hut, and house in one part or

another. Substantial store towers dot the Atlas and serve as citadels in time of
war. Almost every ruin is ascribed to European builders, but of history little is

to be found. There have been several Berber historians of note, who have wi-itten

in Arabic, some being translated, and several French scholars have paid consider-

able attention to this interestmg people, of whom we even now know so compara-

tively little.

       3. On the Worship of Meteorites. By Professor H. A. Newton.

     The paper consists of a series of accounts of the worship of meteorites and of
myths and traditions pointing to such worship in early times. More particularly
are the indications of such worship that are found in Greek and llomau history
and literature put together. No attempt to discuss the relations of this worship to
the other worship of natural and artificial forms has been made.

4. On Human Remains from, the Dugglehy ' Howe,' Yorkshire.
                         By J. G. Garson, M.D.

The description of the exploration of this barrow was communicated at the

meeting of the British Association last year by the Rev. E. Maule Cole, M.A., and

is published in the reports of the meeting, page 979.

The barrow is a round one, and consists of a thick outer layer of rough chalk,

in which were found several secondary interments, consisting of burnt bones, the

bones of horse and deer, some Roman and British pottery, and iron, bone, and

flint implements. Below this was a layer of Kimmeridge clay a foot thick, cover-
ing over the whole of an inner mound in which the skeletons to be described were

found. This inner mound was composed of two layers, an upper one of small

chalk grit 4^ feet thick, and an inner one of clay soil in which the skeletons were

deposited. The implements found with them were flint flakes and worked flints,
the remains of Stis, beaver, Bos longifrons, and fox. No metal of any kind occurred

below the layer of Kimmeridge clay. In the centre of the mound was a large pit

or grave 9 feet deep and a smaller and shallower one by its side. The large grave

contained three skeletons and the skull of a fourth ; over its mouth in the clay were

other three skeletons. In the smaller grave was a skeleton, and between the two

graves was another skeleton. Above the smaller grave were other two skeletons.

The majority of the skeletons were found lying on the side ; in all cases the limbs

were drawn up and flexed. The directions in which the bodies had been placed

Avaried.  food vase was found at the bottom of the large grave.

Several of the skeletons were considerably decayed, others were those of

children, so that seven only were available for examination and the skull of an

eighth person. Many of the long bones were not preserved, but most of them

were measured at the time of excavation. These measurements were submitted by

Mr. J. R. Mortimer (under whose direction the exploration of the barrow was

conducted) to the author along with such of the long bones of three of the

skeletons as had been preserved. From the measurements of the lower limb-

bones of these three skeletons and those of the others measured by INIr. Mortimer,

the author finds that the average stature of the skeletons is l'667m. estimated

from the femur and tibia, and 1-665 m. from the femur alone. The shortest had

an indicated stature of 1 '5.55 m. estimated from the femur and tibia, and of

1'546 m. from the femur. The taUest was l"9y9 m. estimated from the femur and

tibia, and l'890m. from the femur alone. Excluding this very tall skeleton the

average of the others is 1-619 m. from the femur and tibia, and 1-642 m. from

the femur. The femur of the tall skeleton has been fortunately preserved, and

was measured by the author.

The form of the slrull viewed from above is that of an elongated oval. In

most cases the walls appear very straight. The frontal region is narrow, and

there is no bulging of the occipital region, the outline being, as a rule, very regular.

The muscular ridges are feebly developed, the glabella and superciliary ridges are

also feebly developed. The face is generally long and narrow, the orbital axes are

depressed externally, the orbits themselves being in form either round, nearly

square, or broadened rectangular. The interorbital width is narrow. The lower

margins of the nasal openings are sharp. The maxilla are orthognathous and the

incisor teeth are vertical. The chin is generally pointed and sharp. The cephalic

index of the eight adult skulls varies from 66-5 to 79-6. Five of the specimens are

hyperdolichocephalic, one is dolichocephalic, and two are mesaticephalic. The

cephalic index of the tall skeleton is 68-8. The other skulls found were those

of children, and are consequently not included. These eight specimens include all

the adult males found in and about the graves in the centre of the barrow.

In stature and the characters of the skull these specimens appear in all respects

to be identical with the specimens found in long barrows of the dolichocephalic

people admitted to be the earliest known inhabitants of Britain, whose skeletons

are still available for examination. They are found in the interior of this round ·

barrow, it will be noted, associated with flint implements only, and with no trace

of the metal objects usually foimd in round barrows with brachycephalic skulls,

while these metal articles were found in the outer layer, which, from its contents,
is evidently of later date and superadded to the original inner barrow.

5. On Comparison of Ancient Welsh Customs, Devices, and Commerce, with
            those of Contemporary Nations. By Dr. Phenk, F.S.A.

     It was pointed out that the present age, which is one enriched from commerce,
science, and the arts, has, to a great extent, ceased to be influenced by heraldry,
which is naturally connected with military advancement. But that, as a matter
of history, the great influence it once had on the progress of civilisation in securing
victory or averting defeat made it a subject well worthy review.

     Though no written code of heraldic law is known to have existed in ancient
times, yet the customs of different people in connection with their banners and
ensigns indicate the important part they bore among conquering nations.

     It is shown from the writings of Sidonius ApoUinaris and others, that the
Romans worshipped the image of the Emperor, which was attached to the staff" of
the standard eagle and other devices ; and Oonstantine, taking advantage of this
fact, and abhorring such profanity, placed the emblem of the new faith which he
upheld in the place previously so occupied. It is impossible to imagine a more
imperative call to conquest. The contempt with which the Romans at first treated
the subject, by elevating a tuft of straw on a pike as an ensign, was no doubt
changed on finding that the nations they combated elevated the objects they
worshipped, and became obstinately brave around them. These being conquered
and amalgamated with the Roman soldiers would be allowed either to carry their
own banner or would see it at the head of their legion, thus preventing desertion
and ensuring allegiance. The eagle was the standard of the legions, but each
cohort carried a banner with a serpent woven on it called dracbn (the dragon),*
which was carried by the draconarius. The Gauls and all the Gallic tribes are
shown to have borne the dragon, distinguishing their tribes by the colour of their
banner. Drayton gives the colour of the dragon of Wales to be red, and the
dragon of England white. The Bayeux tapestry shows the banner of William the
Norman to be the old Norse dragon, and he is also surrounded with dragon ensigns

of the Keltic people, whose alliance he hoped for, or had already secured. When

England and Scotland were at war, the great Scotch seals always exhibit the
dragon as supporters in the various reigns ; there are always more than one indi-
cating the alliance with Wales, Ireland, and sometimes with Scandinavia.

    The subject is of Oriental origin. Agamemnon had three dragons emblazoned
in brilliant colours on his breast-plate. The Trojans also used the serpent for a
device, it being sacred with them. When the two serpents from Tenedos had
killed the Trojan priest, Laocoon, who had offended Apollo, they calmly retired to
the shrine of Minerva, whose emblem was a serpent. She being the goddess of

wisdom, it is not improbable that the term ' wise as serpents ' arose from this.

The Gallic dragon and the Roman eagle occupy equally the grand summit of the

old papal mint at Avignon.
     Dragon ceremonies still exist in several parts of Europe, and till recently were

in use on the great main roads leading to Wales. On these roads are also vast

di-aconic simulations. There is a cave of worship at Sarphle, near Llangollen in
Denbighshire, beneath the head of a vast natural outcrop of white quartz, which
assumes the undulations of a huge serpent. The name of the spot is ' The Place
of the Serpent ' the traditions attached to it are extraordinary. The late Welsh

-- --poet ' Ceii-iog ' adopted his name his family name being Hughes from what he
--called the inspiration given him at this place the stream Ceiriog running at the

foot of the hUl on which the serpent reclines.

  --This information was privately given to Dr. PhenS, who now the poet being
--dead considers it the property of the Welsh bards, it being, as it were, an

inspiration from the Pythian Apollo of Parnassus.

                                                     Also called textilis unguis.
 808 REPORT-- 1891.

      In Stow's Annals an elaborate description is given of a procession of Queen
 Elizabeth on a throne chariot having a Lion on one side and a Dragon on the
 other, as supporters of the Arms of England.

      Other customs of the early (Welsh) Britons were found to agree, like that of
 the Draconarius, with Roman, or rather with Italian customs, for they still exist
 in rural Italy. For example, the wooden constructions described by Cffisar as the
 residences of the Britons are still used in Latium. The one recorded to have
 been the house of Romulus (Casa Rovmli) was preserved by the Romans on the
 Capitoline Hill till the time of Caractacus. Dionysius of Halicarnassus mentions it

in his history of Rome only a few years before. The standard of Caractacus being

 the same as that of the cohorts, and his appeal being probably suggested by the
' humble cottage 'of their own founder, which was like his own, described by him
 as being in Britain, would have had so startling an effect that there is no wonder
 his cliains were struck off. This singular fact shows that the customs of Italy
were not unlike those of the Welsh ; though Caractacus and his relations were
pardoned, they preferred to locate themselves in Italy and did not return home.

      There was reason to think, from recent discoveries, that the great trade in
metals and metallic works of art extended to the British Islands in times before
the Phojnician traffic. The bronzes of Etruria, as pointed out by Mr. Dennis,
have been found ' from Switzerland to Denmark, and from Ireland to Hungary.'
This being so, and there being a chain of ports from Basta in Apulia, by those 'of
the Bastetani, the tin workers in Spain, the name of Bassenthwaite in Cumberland
and Bassaleg near Cardiff indicate a commercial connection between those places
and Italy. It is not improbable that Basselg was in remote times the name of the
port, as the word is equivalent to bright metal, and an old Italian word. If so, the
roads reputed to have been made by Mael Mutius to and from Caerleon, and the
local Venta are well accounted for.

7. Foints of Contact between Old-ivorhl Myths and Customs and the Navajo

         Myth entitled ' The Mountain Chant' By A. W. Buceland.

     In presenting a slight sketch of a very curious myth of the Navajo Indians of

New Mexico, which, under the name of ' The Mountain Chant,' is given at length

in the ' Smithsonian Report of the Bureau of Ethnology,' vol. v., Miss Buckland
draws attention to the numerous points in which the myth reproduces customs and

beliefs of the Old World. Among these may be cited the singular prohibition

against eating food in the under-world or abode of spirits, such as appears in the
classical story of Persephone, but which is found slightly modified in the fairy

folk-lore of Europe, in Aino and Japanese tales, and in New Zealand. In the

American myth the prohibition is four times repeated in the abodes of gods in the
form of animals. Then there is the ceremonial cutting of the hair of children in
their fourth year, which is both an American and Japanese custom. The use of
the swasttJca is also traced, both among the Navajos and the Japanese, and in both
countries special reverence is paid to the cardinal points, which in America are
symbolised by particular colours. The ceremonial use of flint implements in the
Navajo rites is also noteworthy, and several other points in the myth denote a very

early origin.

     The great peculiarity in the healing rites, which are held in connection with
the Navajo myth, are the use of sacrificial sticks, variously painted and adorned
with beads and feathers, and buried in accordance with traditional usage, and the
making and erasing, on the same day, of large sand pictures, regarded as of great
sanctity and special healing power, the pigments from the forms of the gods
depicted being applied to the similar afflicted parts of the patient's body.

     Miss Buckland points out the great contrast between these bloodless Navajo
                       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.           809

rites and the sanguinary ceremonies of the ancient Mexicans, and the dissimilarity
in the forms of the Navajo and Mexican g-ods as denoting an entirely different
origin for the two religions, incompatible with the belief, commonly entertained, of
the wholly indigenous character of American culture, and believes that the Navajo
rites point unmistakably to an Eastern origin.

8. East Central African Customs. By Rev. James Macdonald.

     The author introduced the subject by a reference to the great dispersion iu the
plain of Shinar, and the tenacity with which man had clung to the slender stock

of ideas in the land of his strangership.

    The customs dealt with ranged over the whole domestic and social life of the
people. He began by an account of trial by ordeal which is universal in the Lake

region. The trial begins in open Court when evidence is led, but as it never occurs

to anyone to tell the truth, the cause is usually decided by the accused drinking the
Kpoison bowl.
               he vomits the poison he is innocent, even should he' have been

caught red-handed. There are times when the poison bowl is administered to

large numbers by the magicians. This is to weed out thieves, wizards, and other

undetected criminals.

At puberty boys are circumcised, and girls go through a process of initiation

into womanhood. The former are now men, and discard all labour for the duties

of war and hunting.

   A man who wishes to form a new village community selects a site and

strengthens his position by inducing others to join their fortunes to his ; by the

purchase of slaves ; marrying slave wives, and raiding with the view of capturing

Whenslaves.  he has established bis position, the village is recognised by the

chief and comes under the general tribal laws and customs.

Under these laws a man holds as many slaves as he can capture or purchase.

They are his absolute property, and the law permits a man to kill a slave, but should

he do so unjustly, ' the flesh will melt off' his bones and he will die.' Slaves have

a quasi right to property, and often get rich under their masters. Should they be

sold or die, the property reverts to the master.

Slaves and all property, as well as tribal and governing rights, descend not to

a man's sons, but to his brother, the son of his own mother, or, failing that, to his

sister's son. This is to make sure that the family blood is in his veins. Wives,

like slaves, may be had by purchase, by presentation, or by raiding. An unborn

-- --infant may be conditionally betrothed ; children of a fe vv days old frequently are.

In all public undertakings the oracle must be consulted by means of divination.

This may be by poiuing out flour, which if it forms a perfect cone is favourable,

or by shakuig the contents of a gourd, teeth, pebbles, &c., and throwing them

down as dice. Even after the omen is favourable, a rabbit or snake crossing the

path on the first day stops the expedition.

Magicians have absolute power, and are in requisition in connection with every

detail of life. They practise medicine, detect witches, protect crops, and generally

are responsible for the conduct of all work during peace and war. The most for-

midable among them is the tribal prophetess. She sees the gods face to face, and

dreams dreams which pertain to revelation. Her oracles are received without

question, and when she orders a human sacrifice no one dare refuse her demands.

She travels about the country detecting wizards who cause sickness. This she

does by assembling the whole community, and, after shouting and ranting among

the crowd, touching each one's hand. The wizard's hand when touched is known

to her, and he is summarily disposed of, but not before she has proved his guilt.

This she does by finding the ' horns.' These are generally the horns of a small

antelope, which are par excelleiice witches' horns. She finds the horns by ascending

beside the stream, passing the patient's house, and at a certain spot, after much

ceremony, digging them from the ground. She, meantime, has spent the previous

night in the open air listening to spirit voices, while the villagers, on pain of being

accused of witchcraft, must remain indoors. When she orders a human sacrifice
--810
                              REPORT 1891.

-the victim is tied hand and foot to a forest tree and left for the night. If devoured
by wild animals, the gods have accepted the offering ; if not, he is thrown into lake
or river or allowed to die of starvation. The slave was not worth the god's accept-

ance.

Like their Celtic sisters of the north of Scotland, African witches can by their

arts ' steal the fret ' of cows and goats. To this also the prophetess must see.

Murder, adultery, arson, and other serious crimes are capital. The murderer is

handed over to the murdered man's relatives to be put to death in the manner

most agreeable to their feelings, and fancy. Arson is a crime in which the

lex talimiis is practised. House for house ; field for field ; the man's wives and

family when he has nothing. Adultery and the law of marriage, in a land where

chastity is hardly known, is a curious jumble. Divorce is granted for all sorts of

small causes. Speaking disrespectfully of one's parents-in-law, neglecting to hoe the

fields on the part of the wife, or the "women's garment-mending on the part of the

husband, is suflicient cause. At the same time adultery is punished in the most

Abarbarous manner.  suspected wife is made to fish up a stone from a jar of

boiling oil- with her bare arm. As the injury is slight or severe she is innocent or

guilty. If guilty, her head is placed in a huge kind of nut-cracker and squeezed to

make her confess her lover's name. If she refuse, the torture may be continued
Atill the walls of the skull collapse.
                                        man may have determined to get rid of his

wife because she neglected an afternoon's hoeing, but should he find her in an

intrigue in the interval she is simply hacked to pieces. Some head men put all

male ofl"enders to death as they might interfere with their harems.

AVar in South Africa resolves itself into a cattle hunt ; in Central Africa into a

slave hunt, at times, it is to be feared, into a mutton hunt, for prisoners are now and

then eaten by their captors.

Death is usually the work of wizards, and the magicians detect these, who are

put to death. The dead are mourned for by beating of drums, wailing and weeping.

ARelatives shave their heads ; in the case of a head man, the whole tribe do so.
Avotive pot is placed near the deceased's house where ofierings are left,
                                                                                  slave

may be killed to be buried with his master, so that the former ' may not go alone.'

Mock funerals are common, at which the mourners attend to deceive demons, so

that they may not get hold of the spirit of the departed. In this case the real

funeral is conducted very quietly. Ancestor-worship is universal. The ancestors

in the spirit-land are at peace. No Milton has set them by the ears. Lightning
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   _

as an impersonal god is worshipped by some. Spirits may re-appear in material

form, but never for good, always for evil.

    Man and all animals came out of a hole in the earth which was 'closed by the

great ancestor.' Monkeys were then human, but having quarrelled with their
friends, went to live in the bush. To spite their relatives they began to pick up
seeds sown- This tendency became hereditary, and so it is that monkeys cannot
grow corn, as they pick up their own seed. Africans declare that monkeys play
with firebrands when men leave fires in the forest, which may explam the
wonderful sights witnessed by Emin Pasha.

     The principal industrial arts are, working in metals and the pursuit of agricul-

ture. In the former the Africans are making steady and sustained progress. Tradi-
tion points to an age of wooden spades and hoes ; now iron is universal. This
they smelt from its ore. In woodwork there does not appear to be the same pro-

gress made.

The minor customs and superstitious referred to incidentally by Mr. Macdonald

were very numerous, and had reference to charms, sacred animals, how crows are

always looking for seeds lost by an ancestor of theirs, and many others which are

interesting not only to the ethnologist, but to all who wish to have an acquaints

ance with the habits of life among savage men. The chief must show unbounded

Howhospitality, and the taxes must be light.  both these virtues are to be

practised jurists do net defii:e, but it has a curious resemblance to what was com-

mon among the Celtic clans two or three centuries ago.

  1. The Formation of a Record of the Prehistoric and Ancient Pemains of
                         Olamorganshire. By Edwin Seward.

     Glamorgansliire possesses a considerable number of those traces of the existence
of man and his handywork which remain from the earliest historic and prehistoric
periods. In caverns and fissures of the mountain limestone clifl's of Gower, in
camps which crown their summits and those of the main ranges throughout the
county, in tumuli and barrows elsewhere, and in Roman villas and dwellings dis-
covered on the lower plains, are evidences of man through successive ages and
varying stages of civilisation. One feature of much interest is the number and
importance of ancient inscribed stones, many of which are still remarkable for
beauty and intricacy of design in spite of the careless or mischievous treatment to
which they have usually been exposed, even till very recently. In a district pos-
sessing heritages of such a kind, it is especially desirable that a systematic and
comprehensive means of registering each of these objects of value should be set on
foot and maintained, and that opportunities should be afforded for the further
investigating, recording, and classifying all known examples, whilst also offering
inducements and opportunities towards the discovery or efficient recognition of

fresh ones.

     Apart from a descriptive record, it is sought to indicate the nature and locality
of these remains on maps, so as to produce a defined but progressive view of them
as affecting, or as affected by, topographical conditions. Mr. Seward outlined the
preliminary steps taken for organising the work of recording, and described a pro-
posed method of utilising the smaller sheets of the Ordnance Survey for map
purposes, showing also what has been done in the locality towards compiling a
photographic survey of objects of interest, prehistorical and arch^ological.

2. Instinctive Criininality : its true Character and National Treatment.

                            By S. A. K. Strahan, M.D.

The instinctive criminal belongs to a decaying race, and is only met with in

families whose other members show signs of degradation. In fact, instinctive

criminality is but one of the many known signs of family decay. This is conclu-

sively proven by the fact that the criminal's parents and relatives invariably show

--signs of decay, and that he himself has, in common with the idiot which latter is
--the lowest form of human development consistent with a continuance of life such

grossly degenerate characters as a small, overlarge, and ill-sbapen head, paralysis,

squint, asymmetrical features, deformities ; a shrunken, ill-developed body

abnormal conditions of the genital organs ;  liability to  tubercular  disease                               prema-
                                                                                                          ;

ture decay of the tissues ; large, heavy, misshapen jaws, outstanding ears, and a

restless, animal-like, or brutal expression. The instinctive criminal lacks the

moral sense as the idiot lacks tlie intellectual, and in both we find more or less

deep degeneration affecting the whole economy, physical, moral, and intellectual.

  --Hereditary Character of Crime. This has been known from veiy early times.

It was advocated and demonstrated by Aristotle, yet it is only recently that this
--812 KEPORT 1891.

view is approaching- preneral acceptance. But what the writer wishes to impress

is not that criminality is hereditary, that now being generally admitted, but the

indisputable fact that it is interchangeable with other degenerate conditions, such

as idiocy, epilepsy, suicide, insanity, prostitution, scrofula, drunkenness, &c., and

that it is a mere chance whether the insanity or drunkenness, say, of the parent

will appear as such in the child, or be transmuted in transmission to one or other

--of the above mentioned degenerate conditions.
    Mode of I'ransmission. Criminality here follows the same lines as other states
of decay. In some cases it is transmitted through several generations unchanged,

but this is rare. Occasionally a generation of criminals will appear in a decaying

famil)' as a generation of deaf-mutes or epileptics at times appears in the family of

the scrofulous or insane diathesis. But in the majority of cases crime only appears

in one, two, or three members of the family, the others showing the taint in various

ways e.g. one will be scrofulous or a deaf-mute, another insane, idiotic, or a

prostitute, as the case may be.

   --Chief Sources of Instinctive Criminality All deteriorating influences are

liable to result in crime as in other form of degeneration in the offspring. Alco-

holism, however, is its most fruitful source. Rossi puts the percentage of drunken-

Weyness in parents of criminals at 43-6, Marro at 41,  at 38'7, and Tarnowsky, in

the parents of prostitutes, at no less than 82-66. Here the environment must have

an efi'ect ; but as education and example cannot account for the idiocy, epilepsy,

deformity, iSrc, in the children of the drunkard, neither can it be held largely

responsible for the crime and prostitution. Insanitj', epilepsy, and suicide are

often transmuted to crime in passing to the children. Of all persons convicted of

murder in England and Wales in the decade 1879-88, 32 per cent, were found

insane, and 32 per cent, more had their sentences commuted, many on the ground

Aof mental disorder.  neurotic family history was found in criminals in Elmira

Reform in 13'7 per cent, (parents alone) ; at Auburn, in 2303 ; Rossi, 35.

     Tubercular Disease is another cause. Great numbers of criminals are them-

-- --selves tubercular almost as many as of idiots and it is common in their families.

Tarnowsky found a phthisical parentage in 44 per cent, of prostitutes.

Senility and Immaturity of Parents are also fruitful sources of crime in the

--enfeebled descendants, as is proved by the statistics of INIarro, Korosi, and others.
    True Positioji of the Criminal. He is not a free agent. He is as helpless

against his instinct to crime as is the epileptic against his convulsion, or the

suicide against the instinct which impels him to self-destruction. The great

stumbling-blocks to the recognition of the criminal's true position are the doctrine

of ' free-will,' and the belief that all come into the world with a certain regular

quantum of moral sense. These are fundamental errors. When we accept the

fact that moral feeling and volitional power are not imvarying gifts, but depend

as much upon the proper development and healthy action of the higher nervous

centres as does the exercising of any other intellectual function whatever, we shall

see that the suicide without reasonable cause, his sister who becomes a prostitute,

his brother who does murder at the command of a voice from heaven, and the
other member of the family who is an incurable thief, are all equally the victims

of a vicious organisation. This has been practically admitted by the recognition

of the dipso- and klepto-maniac ; but if justice is to be done, the system must be

largely extended.

  --Present Treatment. The present system has proved a disastrous failure.

Short periods of punitive imprisonment can have no etiect upon the instinctive

criminal, either curative or deterrent. The records I'ead in our courts daily prove

this, and the present system must go after the whip and chain of the maniac.

  --Proposed Treatment. Everything points in the direction of prolonged or inde-

finite confinement of the instinctive criminal and habitual drunkard in industrial

penitentiaries. Upon detection as such, they would be permanently contined, as

our imbeciles and incurable lunatics are at present, but with this difference. lu

these homes the inmates would be taught trades, &c., and would receive, with

liberty to spend in any reasonable way, all they might earn over and above the

cost of their maintenance. This would not only protect society against its anti-
                                                                TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.                                                                                                                                             813

social members, bat it would protect these against themselves, while, by keeping
the sexes apart, it would have an immediate and marked effect upon the produc-

--tion by propagation of the criminal classes. This system at once Christian,

humane, and economical--has been tried with success in America. Lifelong
detention has not been found by any means necessary in all cases. Offenders
captured young and taught morally and intellectually so far as may be possible,
and also some trade, and made to feel that they really can earn an honest liveli-

hood, will benefit most. Many such may be given a chance outside under sur-
veillance, or may be turned free with safety to society ; their anti-social instincts

being sufficiently blunted as to be overcome even under the feeble will-power of

their unfortunate owners.

                                                 3. The Anthropometric Method of Identifying Criminals.

                                                                       By J. G. Garson, M.n.

In daily life cases of difficulty not imfrequently occur in the identification

of persons living or dead, or after accident, such as a railway collision, and in

police-courts it is especially common, for evil-doers make a point, as far as pos-

sible, of concealing their identity. In 1879 M. Bertillon submitted to the

Prefecture of Police of Paris a plan for the identification of criminals, founded

upon the measurement of certain bony parts of the body not liable to alteration

with age or accident. The plan had been adopted, and has been in use with signal

success in Paris since 1882. Before the introduction of Bertillon's system, photo-

graphs and vague descriptions, much the same as those still used by the English

police, were the only means for identifying persons previously convicted of crime.

As time went on, the number of photographs of criminals increased so rapidly

that in a few years they exceeded 100,000, and it was found that the system was
almost if not altogether unworkable. By Bertillon's system these photographs

and descriptions of criminals are divided primarily into three groups, according to

whether their stature is tall, medium, or short. By the length of the head, these

groups are still further subdivided into persons with long, medium, and short

Aheads.                                          third measurement, the breadth of the head, divides the number in each

group still more, according as the head is broad, medium, or narrow ; and by other

measurements groups are reduced to a number of smaller ones. The various

descriptions and photographs are arranged in a series of drawers with subdivisions

corresponding to the different measurements and their subdivisions. When a

person is brought to the police-station, the first thing done is to ascertain if he

is an old offender, and has been measured before, by taking his principal measure-

ments and afterwards referring to the cabinet containing the descriptions and

measurements of criminals. The measurements one by one guide the officer to the

exact division of the cabinet where the description of the prisoner will be foimd.

Should the prisoner's height when previously measured have been, say, just within

the tall division, and now is at the upper end of the medium division, the officer, on

not finding him in the medium division, would search for him in the tall group,

just as he would look for a word in the dictionary about the spelling of which he

--was in doubt. The measurements relied upon in Bertillon's system are: (1) Height

of body                                          (2) length of  head ;  (3) breadth  of head                                                                                                                 (4)  length  of   middle  finger
                                              ;                                                                                   ;

(left)                       (5) length of little finger (left) ;              (6)   length of forearm;                                                                                                                   (7)  length of foot
                          ;

(left)                       (8) length of span ;               (9) length of  ear   (right)                                                                                                                 (10) breadth      of ear (right)
                         ;                                                                                                 ;

(11) length                                      and exact  position    of scars, moles, &c.                                                                                                                 (12) colour of eyes  and  hair.
                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

The instruments used by M. Bertillon were exhibited, and the method of u.'^ing

them was shown. The whole operation of measuring a prisoner and taking his

description occupies one officer and an assistant only seven minutes. The success

with which the system has been attended may be judged of from the following

facts : criminals who have tested the certainty with which they can now be re-
cognised seldom give aliases : the number of identifications of previous offenders

has greatly increased, and many known criminals have found it convenient to

change the scene of their actions to places where the system is not in force. In

the many thousands of cases tested there had not been one of mistaken identity.
814 EEPORT 1891.

The addition to the measurements of the prints of the impressions of the fingers,
recently recommended by Mr. Francis Galton, would, in the author's opinion, be
very valuable for personal identification. In conclusion the hope is expressed
that Bertillon's system will soon be introduced into general use in this country.

4. Recent Hittite Discoveries. By Dr. Phen^, F.8.A.

A careful description of the monuments now known to be Hittite, but which

term had not been used when Dr. Van Lennep wrote, was given, and Dr. Phen6

was able to draw inferences from the examination of the monuments before they

were known to be Hittite, and the new light which Professor Sayce, Su- Charles

Wilson, and Professor Ramsay have thrown upon them. This was very interesting,

as the older drawings by Texier and other travellers were found very much more

to support the description by Herodotus than some of the new ones. And, while

they all alike tended to confirm the fact that they belonged to a special people,

who had a style of writing of their own, and which people and writings are now

known under the term * Hittite,' there was every reason to suppose the figures at

--Nymphi were those of the Egyptian king, Ramses II., known also as Ramses the

Great, and also as Ramses Sesostris, although ' Sesostris ' was not found on his

--monuments, and was perhaps a family name. Dr. Phen(5 gave his own reading of

the symbols at Nymphi as follows : The symbols are a crouching bird on a level

with the face of the victorious Sesostris, and close to  it  a  sceptre                               above it a sign
                                                                                                   ;

frequently found in Hittite mscriptions, of a stafi" with smaller ones on each side,

which symbol he considered was equivalent to the people i.e. of high and low

degree ; and following this a broken sceptre. The bird usually found in Hittite

inscriptions, as at Jerabis, is the eagle, and the position is one of majesty, which

he considered implied kingly power, and hence the crouching and humbled bird

was a king bereft of his power. The metaphor is purely Oriental, and in continual

--use in the Hebrew writings, ' a bird of the air shall tell the matter ' ' mine
--enemies chased me like a bird ' ' they shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt,'

meaning clearly, escaped from the crushing power of Egypt. The broken reed or

sceptre is also continually used as a sign of weakened power, so that reading from

-- --right to left the sj^mbols read The bird announces to the conqueror ' The sceptre,

great conqueror, is yours ' ; * Great and small (i.e. the nobles and people) follow ; the

sceptre of the vanquished is broken.' Several other of Dr. Phene's readings, as of the

inscription on Mount Sipylus, were given, as very strongly to support the views of

Mr. Dennis as to this sculpture being the goddess Cybele, and not Niobe, and Dr.

Phene produced an ancient mace procured by him in Sivas, the head of which was

the same symbol, as appears in the inscription near the figure. Dr. Phen6 referred

to the valuable comparison of Hittite and Cypriote letters made by Professor

-- --Sayce at the suggestion of Canon Taylor, and pointed out that the least powerful

one that of o = u was not only capable of amendment, but of being put beyond

Vquestion, as besides the evidence used by Professor Sayce, the actual of the

Cypriotes appears in the Hittite inscription on Mount Sipylus. The author

further expressed his opinion that the figures at lasili, Kaia, &c., were older than

the Assyrian sculptures, and that in them were the ideas carried out in Assyrian

art. The figures standing upon the animal forms in the Hittite carvings being

finally combined with the animals in the Assyrian work. Dr. Phend's attention

was, however, more engaged with a remarkable Cyclopean temple on the Star

mountain near Tokat than with the rock sculptures, which, when he visited them

(and nearly all of which are illustrated in Dr. Van Lennep's book), were generally

considered as a low class of Assyrian or Persian art.

One of the most important points of this journey had been the investigation of

Cyclopean buildings, and this grandly elevated temple, which is semicii'cular in

form, corresponds exactly with others he has found, one of which is in the centre

of the Island of Minorca. The one in Anatolia, which he considers was the great

temple of the district, is in the locality of the most ]'emarkable Hittite sculptures.

It is on the most westerly and the largest of a number of mounds running from

east to west in a serpentine course. In conclusion. Dr. Phen6 described two
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION n.  815

sculptured groups, which appear to give a complete representation of the story of
the Flood, and the district being so near Mount Ararat, it is less surprising that it
should be so, as Armenia abounds with the tradition.

           5. Account of the Similkameen Indians of British Columhia.

                                 By Mrs. S. S. Allison.

     The tribe at present inhabiting the upper valley of the Similkameen are imme-
diately descended from a small band of the warlike Chilcotins, who established
themselves in the upper valley of the river about a hundred and fifty years ago,
and intermarried with the Spokans. They have much deteriorated, both physically
and mentally, within the last twenty years, and are rapidly becoming extinct.
The average stature of the men is about five feet six inches ; their frames are
lithe and muscular, and their movements quick and graceful. Their complexion
is very light, and they have small hands and feet. The colour of their hair varies
from jet-black to red-brown, and in some cases it is almost curly. They are born
horsemen and capital shots. The sharp horns of the mountain goat were formerly
fixed on shafts of hard wood and used as spears both in hunting and warfare ;.
stone knives and hatchets were also used.

     The summer dwellings of the Similkameen Indians were made of mats of
cedar bark, manufactured by the Hope Indians, which were thrown over a circular
frame of poles. The winter houses were simply pits dug in the ground and
roofed with poles and earth. All sickness was supposed to be the work of an evil
spirit, who fastened on a victim and hung on, drawing away his life, until charmed
away by the doctor, who worked himself into a state of frenzy, singing and danc-
ing while he was trying to lure the evil spirit from his patient. Many of the
medicine-men exercise strong mesmeric power over their patients, and they use

several herbs as medicines ; their panacea for all ills, however, is the vapour-
bath.

    When an Indian died he was laid out in state on a couch of skins ; everything
put on the body was new ; his bow and arrows were laid at his side, along with
his knife. His friends then assembled round him to feast, and when the feast was

over his friends advanced, and taking his hand bade him farewell. Immediately
after a funeral takes place the encampment is moved, lest the spirit of the deceased
should revisit it.

   A widow or widower is forbidden to eat meat and certain vegetables for a

month, and must wear quantities of spruce bush inside their shirts, next their

skin.

     Cannibalism was never known among the Similkameens.
     In the mountain is a certain stone which is much venerated by the Indians, and

it is said that striking it will produce rain.
     Polygamy was allowed, and if the husband and wife tired of each other, the

price of the woman, or its equivalent, was returned by her father or guardian, and
the parties were then free to contract another matrimonial alliance ; but adultery,
though it was generally compromised, was sometimes punished by cutting off the
woman's nose or slitting her ears.

     Occasionally sick persons were buried before they were quite dead, and a good
deal of infanticide was practised.

     The author has not found these Indians to be thieves, and gives them a general
good character in other respects.

                         6. Nicohar Pottery. By B. H. Man.

     In a brief but fairly exhaustive pa])er on the pottery made and used by the
Nicobar Islanders, Mr. Man stated that the little island of Chowra has held for
generations a monopoly of the manufacture, and the entire work of preparing the
clay, as well as moulding and firing the finished utensil, devolves on the females of
the community.
816 REPORT 1891.

    No traditions are apparently extant regarding the origin of the art, but a

superstitious belief is entertained that an earthquake or suddeH death would result
from any rash endeavour to introduce the industry into any other island of the
Archipelago, and a case is cited which to the Nicobarese mind is sufficiently
confirmatory of the danger of attempting to act in contravention of the customs of

their ancestors.

     The inhabitants of the island appear to guard somewhat jealously this their art,
and natives from the other islands, who accompanied Mr. Man when he was so
fortunate as to find the manufacturers at their trade, had never before been
permitted to witness the process now described in its various stages.

     The value of ' trade-marks ' is recognised, and before a vessel is fired the device
of its maker is affixed ; to their credit, be it noted, care is taken that the ' rights '
of other makers are not infringed by the adoption of any symbol which might

lead to confusion.

     The amount of pottery manufactured during the year cannot of course be
ascertained with any degree of accuracy, but it would seem to be considerable.
Experience having taught them that pots are more serviceable if allowed to harden
gradually, it is their practice to store all newly-made utensils on a lattice-platform
( lenpd) in the roof of their huts, where in the course of a year the combined action
of heat and smoke renders them hard and durable.

    Indian pots and jars are readily purchased from the traders who visit the
islands from time to time, and these, though preferred to the home-made article

on account of their greater durability, are deemed unsuitable for certain of their

--culinary operations. There is also a latent fear lest the local manufacturers to
--say nothing of the Higher Powers should actively resent any exclusive use of

imported utensils.

    No vessels are made specially by the Nicobarese for funeral purposes, but in

accordance with the almost universal custom of uncivilised i-aces coolring pots are
among the personal and household requisites which are laid on a grave after an
interment.

    Mr. Man illustrated his paper with two photographs, showing a group of

Nicobarese potters engaged upon their craft; he further expressly denied that they
had the knowledge of any implement answering the purpose of a ' potter's-wheel.'
