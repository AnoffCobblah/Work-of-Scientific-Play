--beg to report as follows upon the action they have taken in each case :
  First Resolution " That the discontinuance of the maintenance of Kew

Observatory by the British Association having been determined on, the

President and Council be authorized to communicate with the President and

Council of the Royal Society, and with the Government, so that the future

use of the buildings may in 1872 be placed at the disposal of the Royal

Society, in case the Royal Society should desire it, under the same con-

ditions as those buildings are at present held by the British Association."

  A copy of this resolution was forwarded by direction of your Council

to the President and Council of the Royal Society. The following is the

reply which one of your General Secretaries has received from Dr. Sharpey,

Secretary of the Royal Society :

                                                              " The Eoyal Society, Burlington House,

" Deab De. Hibst, In reply to your letter of the 10th December, 1870,

enclosing a copy of a resolution of the General Committee of the British

Association relative to the future occupation of the buildings at Kew now
held by the British Association, I am directed to acquaint you that the

President and Council of the Royal Society are ready to take possession of

the Observatory at Kew on the terms it is at present held from Her Majesty's

Government, as stated in a letter dated 26th March 1842, addressed to the
President of the British Association from the Office of Woods, &c., viz. :
' during the pleasure and upon the conditions usual on sach occasions, that
no walls shall be broken through, and no alterations made that can afi'ect

the stability of the building, and alter its external appearance, without the

previous sanction of the Board of Works.' I have further to acquaint you
that the President and Council have appointed a Standing Committee of

Fellows of the Royal Society for the management of the Kew Observatory

in accordance with the terms of the Gassiot Trust, consisting of the following

gentlemen :

Mr. Warren De La Rue.             Sir Edward Sabine.

and that .£600 from the income of the Gassiot Fund has been placed at the

disposal of that Committee to meet the expenses of the establishment for the

ensuing year.                     " I remain, yours very truly,

                     (Signed)     " W. Shaepey, M.D., Secretary B. S."

   Through, the munificence of Mr, Gassiot, tlicrefore, tho Association can,

^yithout detriment to science, give up possession of the Kcw Observatory at

once instead of in 1872, as -was originally contemplated. Your Council
accordingly recommend that Government should be informed without
further delay of the desire of the Association to see the direction and

--maintenance of the Kew Observatory transferred to the Roj-al Society.
   Second Resolution. " That the Council be empowered to cooperate with
the Eoyal and Eoyal Astronomical Societies, in the event of a new appli-
cation being made to Government to aid in the observation of the Solar
Eclipse of December 1870."

   On the 4tli November a Joint Committee of the Royal and Royal Astro-
nomical Societies decided to make a second application; on the 5th of
November your Council selected a few of their body to accompany the new

deijutation to Government which the above two Societies had resolved to
send. The necessity for any such deputation was subscqiiently obviated
through the intervention of private individuals, and, as is well known, aid
was promptly and liberally granted by Government to the Eclipse Ex-

--pedition.
    Third Resolution. " That the Council be requested to take such steps as
they deem wisest, in order to urge upon Government the importance of
introducing scientific instruction into the elementary schools throughout the

country."

  A Committee of your Council having considered the subject, recommended

the appointment of a deputation to wait upon the Lord President of tho
Council in order to i;rge upon him the desirability of including elementary
natural science amongst the subjects for which payments are made by the
authority of the Revised Code. The Council accordingly formed themselves
into a deputation, and on the 13tli of December 1870 had an interview with
the Right Hon. "W. E. Eorstcr, M.P., Vice-rresident of the Committee of

Council on Education, who was pleased to express his concurrence with tho

objects of the deputation and his willingness to carry out those objects so far

--as circumstances would permit.
    Fourth Resolution. " That tho Council of the British. Association be

authorized, if it should appear to be desirable, to urge upon Her Majesty's
Government the expediency of jn-oposing to the legislature a measure to

insure the introduction of the metric system of weights and measures for

international purposes."

    The Council deemed it expedient to postpone the consideration of this

--resolution.
   Fifth Resolution. " That it is inexpedient that new institutions, such as

the proposed Engineering College for India, should be established by Govern-

ment, until the Royal Commission now holding an inquiry into the relation

of the State to scientific instriictiou shall have issued their report. That the
Council of the British Association be requested to consider this opinion, and,
should they see fit, to urge it upon the attention of Her Majesty's Govern-

ment."

    The Committee appointed without loss of time to consider and report on
this resolution were informed at their first meeting tliat the arrangements
for the establishment of the College had been virtually completed. Your

President, however, in accordance with the wishes of this Committee, entered
into unofiicial communication with tlic authorities at the India Office, relative

to the proposed examination for entrance into the new Engineering College,

and succeeded thereby in gaining for natural science, as compared with

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.      xlix

classics, a recognition, in the form of allotted marks, which it prcviouslj- did

not possess.

   Your Council has given considerable attention to the important question
(raised at the last meeting) of a revision of the regulations relating to the

proceedings of the several Sections at the annual meetings of the Association.
Hitherto, it has been justly urged, these proceedings, from not having been
sufficiently pre-arranged, have fi-equently been of too desultory and mixed
a character. It is hoped that by a proper observance of the Revised Regu-
lations which are this day to be submitted to the General Committee for
approval, and by increased vigilance on the part of the Sectional Committees,

much of this may bo obviated, and that greater prominence may be given to,

and a fuller discussion secured for, the really important communications
which are annually made to the several Sections.

   The Council has pleasure in informing the General Committee that the
Association at length possesses a central office in London. The Asiatic
Society has, in consideration of a yearly rent of £100, granted to the Asso-
ciation entire possession of four of their rooms at 22 Albemarle Street, and
the use of another room for meetings of the Council and Committees. Your
Council, moreover, acting under the power given to thera by the General
Committee at Liverpool, have engaged Mr. Askham as clerk at a salary of

£120 a year. He is in attendance daily, and there transacts much of the

business which was formerly done at the office of Messrs. Taylor and Francis,
the printers to the Association. With the exception of certain works of

reference, the whole of the books and MSS. formerly deposited at Kew have

been transferred to 22 Albemarle Street, and are being catalogued and
rendered available for reference by Members of the Association. One of the
four rooms not at present in use has been sub-let to the London Mathe-

matical Society.

    The Council having been informed by Dr. Hirst of his desire at the close
of the present Meeting to resign his ofRce as Joint General Secretary of the
Association, appointed a Committee, consisting of the General Officers and
former General Secretaries, to select a successor. This Committee unani-
mously recommended the appointment of Captain Douglas Galton, C.B.,
F.R.S. The Coimcil, entirely agreeing with the Committee as to the high
qualifications of Captain Galton for the office, cordially recommend his
election by the General Committee at their meeting on Monday next.

    The Council cannot allow this occasion to pass without expressing their
sense of the great services rendered to the Association by Dr. Hirst; but
they abstain from saying more, as they are unwilling to anticipate a more
mature expression on the part of the General Committee.

    The Council have added the following names of gentlemen present at the
last Meeting of the Association to the list of Corresponding Members :

Professor Van Beneden.      H. H. the Rajah of Kolapore,
                            M. Plateau.
Dr. Crafts.
                            Professor Tchebichef.
Dr. Anton Dohrn.
Governor Gilpin, Colorado.

   The General Committee will remember that Brighton has already been
selected as the place of meeting next year. Livitations for subsequent
meetings have been received by your Council from Bradford, Belfast,
and Glasgow.

   The Coimcil, lastly, recommend that the name of Professor Balfour be

added to the list of Vice-Presidents of the present Meeting.

Report of the Kew Committee of the British Association for the

                   Advancement of Science for 1870-71.

   The Committee of the Kew Observatory submit to the Council of the British

Association the follomng statement of their proceedings during the past
year :

(A) WOEK BONT! BY KeW ObSEEVATORT UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE

                          British Association.

--1. Magnetic ivorlc. In their last Eeport the Committee stated the plan on

which they proposed to reduce their Magnetic observations ; they now report

that with reference to the reduction of the Magnetic Disturbances from

January 1865 to December 1869, the period foUowing that which has already

been published, the discussion of Declination and Horizontal Force Disturb-

ances is nearly ready for presentation to the Eoyal Society, and that of the

Vertical Force is in progress ; when that is completed, the whole period, 1865
to 1869 inclusive, will have been discussed at Kew. The tabular statement,

which is herewith presented (see Appendix I.), exhibits the exact state of

the reduction.

Two Dipping-needles by Dover and one by Adie have been tested for Mr.

Chambers, Superintendent of the Colaba Observatory ; and one needle has

been procured from Dover and tested for Prof. JeUnek, of Vienna.

  A Dip-circle by Dover has been verified and forwarded to Prof. Jelinek,

who ordered it on behalf of the K. K. mUitiir-geograpliisches Institut.

Major-General Lefroy, Governor of Bermuda, having applied for the loan

of a Dip-circle, one has now been prepared for his use, and will be forwarded

Ato Bermuda as soon as possible.  Dip-circle has been obtained from Dover,

and, after verification, ^vill be forwarded to the Survey Department, Lisbon.

At the request of Prof. Jelinek the Committee have undertaken to examine

a Dip-circle by Eepsold. It is of a large size and has eight needles, but Prof.

Jelinek reports that the results obtained by them are very discordant.

Copies of certain specified maguetograph curves have been made and for-

warded to the late Sir J. Herschel, M. DiamiUa Miiller, of Florence, and Senhor

CapeUo, of Lisbon, at the request of those gentlemen.

The usual monthly absolute determinations of the magnetic elements con-

tinue to be made by Mr. "\Miipple, the Magnetic Assistant.

The Self-recording Magnetographs are in constant operation as heretofore,

--also nuder his charge.
   2. Meteorological ivorh. The meteorological work of the Observatory

continues in the charge of Mr. Baker.

Since the Liverpool Meeting, 113 Barometers (including 17 Aneroids) have

been verified, and 2 rejected ; 1320 Thermometers and 215 Hydrometers have

like^wise been verified.

Two Standard Thermometers have been constructed for Owens College,

Manchester, one for the Bugby School, one each for Profs. Harkness and

Eastmanu, of the Washington Observatory, four for Dr. Draper, of the New

York Central Park Observatory, one for Major Norton, of the Chief Signal

Office, "Washington, one for Mr. G. J. Symons, and three for the Meteorolo-

gical Committee.

Three Thermograph Thermometers have been examined for Mr. Chambers,

of the Colaba Observatory, and three for the Meteorological Committee.
                REPORT OF THE KEW COMMITTEE.                        li

Two Standard Barometers have been purchased from Adie, and tested at

Kew, one of which has becu forwarded to the Chief Signal Office, Washington,

and the other to Prof. Jack, of Fredricton, New Brunswick.
   Tubes for the construction of a Welsh's Standard Barometer on the Kew

pattern, together with the necessary metal mountings, and a Cathetometer,

have been made under the superintendence of the Committee for the Chief

Signal Office, Washington.

The Committee have likewise superintended the purchase of meteorological

instruments for Owens College, Manchester, and for the ObseiTatory attached

to the University of Fredricton, New Brunswick.
   The Kew Standard Thermometer (M. S. A.), divided arbitrarily by the late

Mr. Welsh, and employed for many years past as the standard of reference

in the testing of thermometers, was accidentally broken on the 3rd of January.

Since then a Kew Standard, of the ordinary construction, made in 1866, and

which had been compared on several occasions with M. S. A., has been used

to replace it.

  Copies of some of the meteorological observations made at Kew during the

years 1869 and 1870 have been supplied to the ^Institution of Mining

Engineers at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and the Editor of Whitaker's Almanac,

the cost of the extraction being paid by the applicants in both instances.

  A set of self-recording meteorological instruments, the property of the

Meteorological Committee, have been erected in the Verification-house, and

are now undergoing examination.';'

  The self-recording metereological instruments now in work at Kew will be

again mentioned in the second division of this Eeport. These are in the

charge of Mr. Baker.

  3. PhotoJieJiocjraph.--Thc Kew Heliograph, in charge of Mr. Warren De

La Rue, continues to be worked in a satisfactory manner. During the past

year 362 pictures have been taken on 205 days. The prints from the

negatives alluded to in last Report have been taken to date, and the printing

Aof these has become part of the current work of the estabHshment.  paper

by Messrs. Warren De La Rue, Stewart, and Loewy, embodying the position

and areas of sim-groups observed at Kew during the years 1864, 1865, and

1866, as well as fortnightly values of the spotted solar area from 1832 to

1868, has been published in the Philosophical Transactions, and distributed

Ato those interested in solar research.  Table exhibiting the number of

sun -spots recorded at Kew during the year 1870, after the manner of

Hofrath Schwabe, has been communicated to the Astronomical Society, and

published in their ' Monthly Notices.'

   An apparatiis is being constructed under the direction and at the expense
of Mr. Warren De La Rue, and it will shortly be erected on the Pagoda in
Kew Gardens, in order to be employed in obtaining corrections for optical

--distortion in the heliographical measurements.
   4. Miscellaneous ivorl: Experiments are being made on the heat produced

by the rotation of a disk in vacuo.

  A daily observation has been made with the Rigid Spectroscope, the

property of Mr. J. P. Gassiot.

Observations have been made with two of Hodgkinson's Actinometers,

the property of the Royal Society, in order to compare them with the

Actinometers deposited at the Observatory, for reference, before forwarding

them to India.

The Committee have siiperintended the purchase of optical apparatus,

chemicals, &c. for the Observatories at Coimbra and Lisbon.

deposited in the Observator}', and forms Appendix III. of the present llepoi+.
    In Appendix II. a list is given of the books at present in the Obsei'va-

tory, the property of the British Association.

                                      Meteokological Committee.

  --1. Work done at Keiv as one of the Observatories of the 2Ieteorolof/tcal Com-

mittee. The Barograph, Thermograph, Anemograph, and Rain-gauge arc
kept in constant operation. Mr. Baker is in charge of these instruments.

   From the first two instruments traces in duplicate are obtained, one set being
sent to the Meteorological Office and one retained at Kew. As regards the
Anemograph and llain-gaugc, the original records are sent, while a copy by
hand of tlicse on tracing-paper is retained. The tabulations from the curves
of the Ivew instruments are made by Messrs. Page and lligby.

  --2. Verification of Records. The system of checks devised by the Kew

Committee for testing the accuracy of the observations made at the different

Observatories continues to be followed, as well as the ruling of zero lines in

the Barograms and Thermograms suggested b}' the Meteorological Office.
Messrs. Bigby and Page perform this work, 3Ir. Baker, Meteorological

--Assistant, having the general supei-intendence of the department.
   3. Occasional Assistance. The Meteorological Committee have availed
themselves of the permission to have the occasional services of Mr. Beckley,

Mechanical Assistant at Xew ; and he has lately been visiting the various

Observatories of the Meteorological Committee.

   The self-recording Eain-gauge, as mentioned in the last Heport, has been
adopted by the ileteorological Committee, and instruments of this kind have
been constructed for the various Observatories.

   A series of comparative observations was commenced in April 1870 of

two Anemometers erected in the grounds attached to the Observatory,
in order to compare the indications of a large and small instrument ; but as
a discussion of the result showed them to have been greatly affected by the
influence of the neighbouring buildings, the instruments were dismounted
in January last and re-erected in an open part of the Park, at a distance
from the Obscrvatorj-. Three months' observations were made in this posi-
tion, and as these proved satisfactory, the instruments have been dismounted.
The cost of this experiment has been defrayed by the Meteorological
Committee. Owing to his duties in Manchester, and to a railway accident.
Dr. Stewart has not been able during the last j'car to devote much time
to the Observatory. During his absence his most pressing duties were dis-
charged by Mr. "Whipple in an efficient manner.

   The Obsei-vatorj- was honoured on the 9th of July b}' a 'vnsit from the
Emperor and Empi-ess of Brazil. Their Majesties were received, on behalf

of the Committee, by Sir E. Sabine and Mr. W. De La Rue.

    In the unavoidable absence, through illness, of Dr. Balfour Stewart, the
Emperor was conducted over the Observatory by the above-named gentlemen,
and the various instruments &c. were explained by Mr. Whipple and the
other members of the staff of the Observatory.

                ADDRESS

                                                    OF

Sir WILLIAM THOMSON, Knt., LL.D., F.R.S.,

                                PRESIDENT.

For the third time of its forty years' history the British Association is

assembled in the metropolis of Scotland. The origin of the Association is

connected with Edinburgh in undying memory through the honoured names

of Robisou, Brewster, Eorbes, and Johnston.

 --In this place, from this Chair, twenty-one years ago, Sir David Brewster

said : " On the return of the British Association to the metropolis of Scot-

" land I am naturally reminded of the smaU band of pilgrims who carried

" the seeds of this Institution into the more genial soil of our sister land."

                       " Sir John Robison, Professor Johnston, and Professor J. D.
" Forbes were the earliest friends and promoters of the British Association.
" They went to York to assist in its establishment, and they found there the

" very men who were qualified to foster and organize it. The Rev. Mr.
" Vernon Harcourt, whose name cannot be mentioned here without grati-

" tude, had provided laws for its government, and, along with Mr. Phillips,
" the oldest and most valuable of our office-bearers, had made aU those
" arrangements by which its success was ensured. Headed by Sii' Roderick
" Murchison, one of the very earliest and most active advocates of the
" Association, there assembled at York about 200 of tlie friends of science."

   The statement I have read contains no allusion to the real origin of the

British Association. This blank in my predecessor's historical sketch I am

able to fill in from words written by himself twenty years earlier. Through

the kindness of Professor PhiUips I am enabled to read to you part of a

letter to him at York, written by David Brewster from AUerly by Melrose,

--on the 23rd of February, 1831 :--
   " Dear Sir, I have taken the liberty of writing yon on a subject of con-

" siderable importance. It is proposed to establish a British Association of

" men of science similar to that which has existed for eight years in Gcr-

" many, and which is now patronized by the most powerful Sovereigns of that

" part of Europe. The arrangements for the first meeting are iu progress ; and

" it is contemplated that it shall be held in York, as the most central city for

My" the three kingdoms.  object in writing yoir at present is to beg that you

·' would ascertain if York will furnish the accommodation necessary for so
                                                      !

                                   ADDRESS.                       IXXXV

" large a meeting (which may perhajis consist of above 100 individuals), if

" the Philosopl^ical Society would enter zcalouslj' into the plan, and if the
" Mayor and influential persons in the town and in the vicinity would be

" likely to promote its objects. The principal object of the Society would

" be to make the cultivators of science acquainted Avith each other, to stimu-

" late one another to new exertions, and to bring the objects of science more

" before the public eye, and to take measures for advancing its interests

" and accelerating its progress."

Of the little band of four pilgrims from Scotland to York, not one now

survives. Of the seven first Associates one more has gone over to the

majority since the Association last met. Yernon Harcourt is no longer witli

us ; but his influence remains, a beneficent and, surely therefore, never dying

influence. He was a Geologist and Chemist, a large-hearted lover of science,

and an unwearied worker for its advancement. Brewster was the founder of

the British Association ; Yernon Harcourt was its law-giver. His code re-

mains to this day the law of the Association.

On the eleventh of May last Sir John Herschel died, in the eightieth year of

his age. The name of Herschel is a household word throughout Great Britain

-- Weand Ireland yes, and through the w^hole civilized world.  of this genera-

tion have, from our lessons of childhood upwards, learned to see in Herschel,

father and son, a ivcesidium et dulce deems of the precious treasure of British

scientific fame. When geography, astronomy, and the i;se of the globes were

still taught, even to poor children, as a pleasant and profitable sequel to "read-

ing, writing, and arithmetic," which of us did not revere the great telescope

of Sir William Herschel (one of the Hundred Wonders of the World), and

learn with delight, directly or indirectly from the charming pages of Sir John

Hersehel's book, about the sun and his spots, and the fiery tornadoes sweeping-

over his surface, and about the planets, and Jupiter's belts, and Saturn's rings,

and the fixed stars with their proper motions, and the double stars, and

coloured stars, and the uebulaj discovered by the great telescope ? Of Sir

John Herschel it may indeed be said, nil tetitjitqvod non ornavit.

  A monument to Faraday and a monument to Herschel, Britain must have.

The nation will not be satisfied with any thing, however sjjlendid, done by

Aprivate subscription.  national monument, the more humble in point of

expense the better, is required to satisfy that honourable i^ride with which

a high-spirited nation cherishes the memory of its great men. But for

the glory of Faraday or the glory of Herschel, is a monument wanted ?

No!

   With regard to Sir John Hersehel's scientific work, on the present occa-
sion I can but refer briefly to a few points which seem to me salient in his

physical and mathematical writings. First, I remark that he has put

forward, most instructively and profitably to his readers, the general theory

of periodicity iu dynamics, and has urged the practical utilizing of it, espe-

cially in meteorology, by the harmonic analysis. It is purely by an appli-

cation of this principle and practical method, that the British Association's

Committee on Tides has for the last four years been, and sliU is, working

towards the solution of the grand problem proposed forty-eight years ago by
Thomas Young in the following words :

   " There is, indeed, little doubt that if we were provided with a sufficiently
" correct series ofminutely accurate o'jservations on the Tides, made not merely

" with a view to the times of low and high water only, but ratlicr to the heights

" at the intermediate times, we might form, by degrees, with the assistance

" of the theory contained in this article * only, almost as perfect a set of tables

" for the motions of the ocean as we have already obtained for those of the

" celestial Ijodies, which are the more immediate objects of the attention of
" the practical astronomer."

   Sir John Herschel's discovery of a right or left-handed asymmetry in the
outward form of crystals, such as quartz, which in their inner molecular

structure possess the heli^oidal rotational property in reference to the plane

of polarization of light, is one of the notable points of meeting between

Natural History and Natural Philosophy. His observations on " epipoHc di-

spersion ". gave Stokes the clue by which he was led to his great discovery of

the change of periodic time experienced by light in fiiUiug on certain substances

and beiug dispcrsively reflected from them. In respect to pure mathematics

Sir John Herschel did more, I believe, than any other man to introduce into

Britain the powerful methods and the valuable notation of modern analysis.

A remarkable mode of symbolism had frcslily appeared, I believe, in the

works of Laplace, and possibly of other French mathematicians                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    it certainly

appeared in Fourier, but whether before or after Herschel's work I cannot

say. "With the French writers, however, this was rather a short method of

writing formuhe than the analytical engine whicli it became in the hands

of Herschel and British followers, especially Sylvester and Gregory (com-

petitors with Green in the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos struggle of 1837)

and Boole and Cayley. This method was greatly advanced by Gregory, who

first gave to its working-power a secure and pliilosophical foundation, and so

prepared the way for the marvellous extension it has received from Boole,

Sylvester, and Cayley, according to which symbols of operation become the

subjects not merely of algebraic combination, but of differentiations and in-

tegrations, as if they were symbols expressing values of varying quantities.

An even more marvellous development of this same idea of the separation of

--symbols (according to which Gregorj* separated the algebraic signs 4- and

from other symbols or quantities to be chai-acterized b}- them, aud dealt with

them according to the laws of algebraic combination) received from Hamilton

a most astonishing generalization, by the invention actually of new laws of
combination, and led him to his famous " Quaternions," of which he gave

his earliest exposition to the Mathematical and Physical Section of this As-

sociation, at its meeting in Cambridge in the year 1845. Tait has taken up

the subject of quaternions ably and zealously, and has carried it into phy-

sical science with a faith, shared by some of the most thoughtful mathematical

naturalists of the day, that it is destined to become an engine of perhaps

hitherto uuimagined power for investigating and expressing results in

Natural Philosophy. Of Herschel's gigantic work in astronomical observa-

tion I need say nothing. Doubtless a careful account of it will be given

in the ' Proceedings of the Eoyal Society of London ' for the next anniver-

sary meeting.

   In the past year another representative man of British science is gone.
Mathematics has had no steadier supporter for hjlf a century than De

Morgan. His great book on the differential calculus was, for the mathema-

tical student of thirty years ago, a highly prized repository of all the best
thiiags that could be brought together under that title. I do not believe

it is less valuable now ; and if it is less valued, may this not be because it

is too good for examination purposes, and because the modern student,
labouring to win marks in the struggle for existence, must not suffer himself
to be beguiled from the stern path of duty by any attractive beauties in the

subject of his studj'^ ?

   One of the most valuable services to science which the British Association
has performed has been the establishment, and the twenty-nine years'
maintenance, of its Observatoiy. The Royal Meteorological Observatory of

Kew was built originally for a Sovereign of England who was a zealous

amateur of astronomy. George the Third iised continually to repair to it

when any celestial i)henomenon of peculiar interest was to be seen ; and a
manuscript book still exists filled with observations written into it by his
own hand. After the building had been many years unused, it was
granted, in the year 1842, by the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Woods
and Forests, on application of Sir Edward Sabine, for the purpose of con-
tinuing observations (from which he had already deduced important results)
regarding the vibration of a pendulum in various gases, and for the purpose
of promoting pendulum observations in all parts of the world. The

--Government granted only the building no funds for carrying on the work

to be done in it. The Boyal Society was unable to undertake the main-
tenance of such an observatory; but, happily for science, the zeal of in-
dividual Fellows of the Eoyal Society and Members of the British Asso-
ciation gave the initial impulse, supplied the necessary initial funds, and
recommended their new institution successfully to the fostering care of the

British Association. The work of the Kew Observatory has, from the

commencement, been conducted under the direction of a Committee of the
British Association ; and annual grants from the funds of the Association have
been made towards defraying its expenses up to the present time. To the
initial object of pendulum research was added continuous observation of the
phenomena of meteorology and terrestrial magnetism, and the construction
and verification of thermometers, barometers, and magnetometers designed
for accurate measurement. The magnificent services which it has rendered
to science are so well known that any statement of them which I could at-
tempt on the present occasion would be superfluous. Their value is due in a
great measure to the indefatigable zeal and the great ability of two Scotchmen,

both from Edinburgh, who successively held the office of Superintendent of

--the Observatory of the British Association Mr. Welsh for nine years, until

his death in 18-59, and Dr. Balfour Stewart from then until the present

time. Fruits of their labours are to be found all through our volumes of
Reports for these twenty-one years.

   The institution now enters on a new stage of its existence. The noble
liberality of a private benefactor, one who has laboured for its welfare with

self-sacrificing devotion unintermittingly from within a few years of its crea-
tion, has given it a permanent independence, under the general management
of a Committee of the Royal Society. Mr. Gassiot's gift of £10,000 secures

the continuance at Kew of the regular operation of the self-recording instru-

ments for observing the phenomena of terrestrial magnetism and meteorology,
without the necessity for further support from the British Association.

                                                                                                              i/2

ISLXXviii                 REPORT 1871.

Tho success of the Kew Magnetic and Meteorological ObseiTatory affords

ah example of the great gain to be earned for science by the founda-

tion of physical observJitories and laboratories for experimental research,

to be conducted by qualified persons, whose duties should be, not teach-

ing, but experimenting. Whether we look to the honour of England, as a

nation v>iiich ought always to be the foremost in promoting physical science,

or to those vast economical advantages which must accrue from such esta-

blishments, we cannot but feel that experimental research ought to be made

with us an object of national concern, and not left, as hitherto, exclusively

to the private enterprise of self-sacrificing amateurs, and the necessarily

inconsecutive action of our present Governmental Departments and of casual

Committees. The Council of the Royal Society of Edinburgh has moved for

this object in a memorial presented by them to the Eoyal Commission on

Scientific Education and the Advancement of Science. Tlie Continent of

Europe is referred to for an example to be followed with advantage in this

--country, in the following words:

   " On the Continent there exist certain institutions, fitted with instruments,

" apparatus, chemicals, and other appliances, which are meant to be, and
" which are made, available to men of science, to enable them, at a moderate
" cost, to pursue original researches."

   Tliis statement is fuUy corroborated by information, on good authority,
Avhich T have received from Germany, to the effect that in Prussia " every
" university, every polytechnical academy, every industrial school (Realschule
" and Gewerbeschule), most of the grammar-schools, in a word, nearly all the

" scliools superior in rank to the elementary schools of the common people, are
" supplied with chemical laboratories and a collection of philosophical in-
" struments and apparatus, access to which is most liberally granted by the

" directors of those schools, or the teachers of the respective disciplines, to
" any person qualified, for scientijic experiments. In consequence, though

" there exist no particular institutions like those mentioned in the me-
" morial, there wiU scarcely be found a town exceeding in number 5000
" inhabitants but offers the possibility of scientific explorations at no other
" cost than reimbursement of the expense for the materials wasted in the
" experiments."

Eurther, with reference to a remark in the Memorial to the effect that, in

respect to the promotion of science, the British Government confines its

action almost exclusively to scientific instruction, and fatally neglects the

advancement of science, my informant tells me that, in Germany, " professors,

"preceptors, and teachers of secondary schools are engaged on account of

" their skilfulness in teacMng                                                                                                                     but professors of universities are never engaged
                                                                                                                                                ;

"unless they have already jjroved, hy their oxvn investigations, that they are

" to be relied upon for the advancement of science. Therefore every shilling

'·'spent for instruction in iiniversities is at the same time profitable to the ad-

" vaneement of science."

   The lAysical laboratories which have grown up in the Universities of
Glasgow and Edinburgh, and in Owens College, Manchester, show the want

felt of Colleges of Eesearch ; but they go but infinitesimally towards sup-

plying it, being absolutely destitute of means, material or personal, for ad-
vancing science except at the expense of volunteers, or securing that volunteers

shall be found to continue even such little work as at present is carried on.
   The whole of Andrews' splendid work in Queen's College, Belfast, has

been done under great difficulties and disadvantages, and at great personal
sacrifices ; and up to the present time there is not a student's physical

--laboratory in any one of the Qneen's Colleges in Ireland a want which

surely ought not to remain unsupplied. Each of these institutions (the
four Scotch Universities, the three Queen's Colleges, and Owens College,

--Manchester) requires two professors of Natural Philosophy one who shall

be responsible for the teaching, the other for the advancement of science by

experiment. The University of Oxford has already established a physical
laboratory. The munificence of its Chancellor is about to supply the Univer-
sity of Cambridge with a splendid laboratory, to be constructed under the
eye of Professor Clerk Maxwell. On this subject I shall say no more at
present, but simply read a sentence which was spoken by Lord Milton in the

--first Presidential Address to the British Association, when it met at York in

the year 1831 : " In addition to other more direct benefits, these meetings
" [of the British Association], I hope, will be the means of impressing on the
" Government the conviction, that the love of scientific pursuits, and the
" means of pursuing them, are not confined to the metropolis ; and I liopc

" that when the Government is fuUy impressed with the knowledge of the

" great desire entertained to promote science in every part of the empire, they
" wiU see the necessity of affording it due encouragement, and of giving every
" proper stimulus to its advancement."

   Besides abstracts of papers read, and discussions held, before the Sec-
tions, the annual Reports of the British Association contain a large mass

of valuable matter of another class. It was an early practice of the Associa-

tion, a practice that might weU be further developed, to call occasionally for
a special report on some particular branch of science from a man eminently
(jualified for the task. The reports received in compliance with these invita-

tions have all done good service in their time, and they remain permanently
useful as landmarks in the history of science. Some of them have led to

vast practical results ; others of a more abstract character are valuable to
this day as powerful and instructive condensations and expositions of the
branches of science to which they relate. I cannot better illustrate the two
kinds of efiicieucy realized in this department of the Association's work than
by referring to Cayley's Report on Abstract Dynamics * and Sabine's Report

on Terrestrial Magnetism t (1838).
   To the great value of the former, personal experience of benefit received

enables me, and gratitude impels me, to testify. In a few pages full of
precious matter, the generalized dynamical equations of Lagrange, the
great principle evolved from Maupertuis' " least action " by Hamilton, and
the later developments and applications of the Hamiltonian principle by
other authors are described by Cayley so suggestively that the reading of
thousands of quarto pages of papers scattered through the Transactions of the

various learned Societies of Europe is rendered superfluous for any one who

desires only the essence of these investigations, with no more of detail than is

necessary for a thorough and practical understanding of the subject.

  --Sabine's Report of 1838 concludes with the following sentence : " Yiewed

" in itself and its various relations, the magnetism of the earth cannot
" be counted less than one of the most important branches of the physical

" history of the planet we inhabit ; and we may feel quite assured tliat the

" completion of our knowledge of its distribution on the surface of the earth

" would bo regarded by our contemporaries and by posterity as a fitting
" enterprise of a maritime people, and a worthy achievement of a nation
" which has ever sought to rank foremost in every arduous and honourable

" undertaking." An immediate result of this lleport was that the enterprise

which it xjroposed was recommended to the Government by a joint Committee
of the British Association and the lloyal Society with such success, that
Capt. James Eoss was sent in command of the ' Erebus ' and ' Terror ' to
make a magnetic survey of the Antarctic regions, and to plant on his way
three Magnetical and Meteorological Observatories, at St. Helena, the Cape,

and Yan Diemen's Land. A vast mass of precious observations, made

chiefly on board ship, were brought home from this expedition. To deduce
the desired results from them, it was necessary to eliminate the disturbance
produced by the ship's magnetism ; and Sabine asked his friend Archibald
Smith to work out from Poisson's mathematical theory, then the only avail-

able guide, the formulae required for the purpose. This voluntary task

Smith executed skilfully and successfully. It was the beginning of a series
of labours carried on with most remarkable practical tact, with thorough
analytical skill, and with a rare extreme of disinterestedness, in the intervals

--of an arduous profession, for the purpose of perfecting and simplifying the

correction of the mariner's compass a problem which had become one of
vital importance for navigation, on account of the introduction of iron ships.
Edition after edition of the ' Admiralty Compass Manual ' has been pro-
duced by the able superintendent of the Compass Department, Captain
Evans, containing chapters of mathematical investigation and formulaj by
Smith, on which depend wholly the jsractical analysis of compass-obser-
vations, and rules for the safe use of the compass in navigation. I firmly
believe that it is to the thoroughly scientific method thus adopted by the
Admiralty, that no iron ship of Her Majesty's Navy has ever been lost
through errors of the compass. The 'British Admiralty Compass Manual'
is adopted as a guide by all the navies of the world. It has been translated
into llussian, German, and Portuguese ; and it is at present being translated

into French. The British Association may be gratified to know that the

possibility of navigating ironclad war-ships with safety depends on applica-
tion of scientific principles given to the world by three mathematicians,
Poisson, Airy, and Archibald Smith.

    Eeturning to the science of terrestrial magnetism, we find in the Eeports

of early years of the British Association ample evidence of its diligent culti-

vation. Many of the chief scientific men of the day from England, Scotland,

and Ireland found a strong attraction to the Association in the facilities which
it afforded to thom for cooperating in their work on this subject. Lloyd,Phillips,
Eox, Eoss, and Sabine made magnetic observations all over Great Britain
and their results, collected by Sabine, gave for the first time an accurate and

complete survey of terrestrial magnetism over the area of this island. I am

informed by Professor Phillips that, in the beginning of the Association, Her-
schel, though a '·' sincere well-wisher," felt doubts as to the general utility and
probable success of the plan and purpose proposed ; but his zeal for terrestrial
magnetism broiight him from being merely a sincere well-wisher to join actively
 and cordially in the work of the Association. " In 1838 he began to give efi"ec-
" tual aid in the great question of magnetical Observatories, and was indeed
 " foremost among the supporters of that which is really Sabine's great work.
 " At intervals, until about 1858, Herschel continued to give effectual aid."
 Sabine has carried on his great work without intermission to the present
 day ; thirty years ago he gave to Gauss a large part of the data required

for working out the spherical harmonic analysis of terrestrial magnetism over

Athe whole earth.  recalculation of the harmonic analysis for the altered

state of terrestrial magnetism of the present time has been undertaken by

Adams. He writes to me that he has " already begun some of the iutroduc-

" tory work, so as to be ready when Sir Edward Sabine's Tables of the values

" of the Magnetic Elements deduced from obseryation are completed, at once

" to make use of them," and that he intends to take into account terms of

at least one order beyond those included by Gauss. The form in which

the requisite data are to be presented to him is a magnetic Chart of the

whole surface of the globe. Materials from scientific travellers of all

nations, from our home magnetic observatories, from the magnetic obser-

vatories of St. Helena, the Cape, Van Diemen's Land, and Toronto, and

from the scientific observatories of other countries have been brought to-

gether by Sabine. Silently, day after day, night after niglit, for a quarter

of a century he has toiled with one constant assistant always by his side
to reduce these observations and prepare for the great work. At this moment,

while we are here assembled, I believe that, in their quiet summer retirement

in Wales, Sir Edward and Lady Sabine are at work on the magnetic Chart

of the world. If two years of life and health are granted to them, science

will be provided with a' key which must powerfully conduce to the ultimate

opening up of one of the most refractory enigmas of cosiuical physics, the

cause of terrestrial magnetism.

To give any sketch, however slight, of scientific investigation performed

during the past year would, even if I were competent for the task,_far ex-

ceed the limits within which I am confined on the present occasion. _A

detailed account of work done and knowledge gained in science Britain

ought to have every year. The Journal of the Chemical Society and the

Zoological Eecord do excellent- service by giving abstracts of all papers

published in their departments. The admirable example afforded by the

German "Fortschritte" and "Jahresbericht" is before us; but hitherto, so far

as I know, no attempt has been made to foUow it in Britain. It is true that

several of  the  annual  volumes of the  Jahresbericht  were  translated                                      but a
                                                                                                           ;

translation, published necessarily at a considerable interval of time after the

original, cannot supply the want. An independent British publication is for
many obvious reasons desirable. The two publications, in German and

English, would, both by their differences and by their agreements, illustrate

the progress of science more correctly and usefuUy than any single work

could do, even if appearing simultaneously in the two languages. It seems

to me that to promote the establishment of a British Year Book of Science is

an object to which the powerful action of the British Association would be

thoroughly appropriate.
    In referrhig to recent advances in several branches of science, I simply

choose some of those which have struck me as most notable.

   Accurate and minute measurement seems to the non-scientific imagination
a less lofty and dignified work than looking for something nev/. But nearly
all the grandest discoveries of science have been but the rewards of accurate
measurement and patient long-continued labour in the minute sifting of

numerical results. The popular idea of Newton's grandest discovery is that
the theory of gravitation flashed into his mind, and so the discovery was
made. It was by a long train of mathematical calculation, founded on
results accumulated through prodigious toil of practical astronomers, that
Newton first demonstrated the forces urging the planets towards the Sun,

determined the magnitudes of those forces, and discovered that a force fol-
--Xcii
REPORT 1871.

lowing the same law of variation with distance urges the Moon towards the
Earth. Then first, we may suppose, came to him the idea of the universality of
gravitation ; butwhen he attempted to compare the magnitude of the force on the
Moon with the magnitude of the force of gravitation of a heavy body of equal

mass at the earth's surface, he did not find the agreement which the law he
was discovering required. Not for years after would he publish his discovery
as made. It is recounted that, being present at a meeting of the Royal Society,
he heard a paper read, describiug geodesic measurement by Picard which

led to a serious correction of the previously accepted estimate of the Earth's

radius. This was what Newton required. He went home with the result,

and commenced liis calculations, but felt so much agitated that he handed
over the arithmetical work to a friend : then (and not when, sitting in a
garden, he saw an apple fall) did he ascertain that gravitation keeps the Moon

in her orbit.
    Faraday's discovery of specific inductive capacity, which inaugurated the

new philosophy, tending to discard action at a distance, was the result of

minute and accurate measurement of electric forces.
    Joule's discovery of thermo-dynamic law through the regions of electro-

chemistry, electro-magnetism, and elasticity of gases was based on a delicacy
of thermometry which seemed simply impossible to some of the most dis-

tinguished chemists of the day.

    Andrews' discovery of the continuity between the gaseous and liquid states

was worked out by many years of laborious and minute measurement of phe-
nomena scarcely sensible to the naked eye.

    Great service has been done to science by the British Association in pro-
moting accurate measurement in various subjects. The origin of exact
science in terrestrial magnetism is traceable to Gauss' invention of methods

of finding the magnetic intensity in absolute measure. I have spoken of
the great work done by the British Association in carrying out the ap-

plication of this invention in all parts of the world. Gauss' colleague in

the German Magnetic Union, AVebcr, extended the practice of absolute
measurement to electric currents, the resistance of an electric conductor,

and the electromotive force of a galvanic element. He showed the rela-

tion between electrostatic and electromagnetic units for absolute mea-
surement, and made the beautiful discovery that resistance, in absolute elec-
tromagnetic measure, and the reciprocal of resistance, or, as we call it, " con-

ducting power," in electrostatic measure, are each of them a velocity. He

made an elaborate and difficult series of experiments to measure the velocity
which is equal to the conducting power, in electrostatic measure, and at the
same time to the resistance in electromagnetic measure, in one and the same
conductor. Maxwell, in making the first advance along a road of which
Faraday was the pioneer, discovered that this velocity is physically related to
the velocity of light, and that, on a certain hypothesis regarding the elastic
medium concerned, it may be exactly equal to the velocity of light. Weber's
measurement verifies approximately this equality, and stands in science
monumentmn cere perennius, celebrated as having suggested this most grand
theory, and as having afforded the first quantitative test of the recondite
properties of matter on which the relations between electricity and light

depend. A remeasurcment of Weber's critical velocity on a new plan by Max-

well himself, and the important correction of the velocity of light by Fou-
cault's laboratory experiments, verified by astronomical observation, seem to
show a still closer agreement. The most accurate possible determination of

Weber's critical velocity is just now a primary object of the Association's

Committee on Electric Measurement ; and it is at present premature to specu-
late as to the closeness of the agreement between that Telocity and the

velocity of light. This leads me to remark how much science, even in its

most lofty speculations, gains in return for benefits conferred by its applica-

tion to promote the social and material welfare of man. Those who perilled
and lost their money in the original Atlantic Telegraph were impelled and

supported by a sense of the grandeur of their enterprise, and of the world-
wide benefits whicli must flow from its success ; they were at the same time
not unmoved by the beauty of the scientific problem directly, presented to
them ; but they little thought that it was to be immediately, through their
work, that the scientific world was to be instructed in a long-neglected and

discredited fundamental electric discovery of Faraday's, or that, again, when
the assistance of the British Association was invoked to supply their elec-
tricians with methods for absolute measurement (which tliey found necessary

to secure the best economical return for their expenditure, and to obviate
and detect those faults in their electric material which had led to disaster),
they were laying the foundation for accurate electric measurement in every
scientific laboratory in the world, and initiating a train of investigation whicli

now sends up branches into the loftiest regions and subtlest ether of natural
philosophy. Long may the British Association continue a bond of union,
and a medium for the interchange of good offices between science and the

world

   The greatest achievement yet made in molecular theory of the proper-
ties of matter is the Kinetic theory of Gases, shadowed forth by Lucretius,
definitely stated by Daniel Bernoulli, largely developed by Herapath, made
a reality by Joule, and worked out to its present advanced state by Clausius
and Maxwell. Joule, from his dynamical equivalent of heat, and his expe-
riments upon the heat produced by the condensation of gas, was able to

estimate the average velocity of the ultimate molecules or atoms composing
it. His estimate for hydrogen was 6225 feet per second at temperature 60°
Fahr., and 6055 feet per second at the freezing-point. Clausius took fully
into account the impacts of molecules on one another, and the kinetic energy

of relative motions of the matter constituting an individual atom. He in-

vesfigated the relation between their diameters, the number in a given
space, and the mean length of path from impact to impact, and so gave the
foundation for estimates of the absolute dimensions of atoms, to which I shall

refer later. He explained the slowness of gaseous diffusion by the mutual

impacts of the atoms, and laid a secure foundation for a complete theory of
the diffusion of fluids, previously a most refractory enigma. The deeply

penetrating genius of MaxweU brought in viscosity and thermal conductivity,
and thus completed the dynamical explanation of aU the known properties

of gases, except their electric resistance and brittleness to electric force.

   No such comprehensive molecular theory had ever been even imagined

before the nineteenth century. Definite and complete in its area as it
is, it is but a well-drawn part of a great chart, in which aU physical
science wiU be represented with every property of matter shown in dyna-

mical relation to the whole. The prospect we now have of an early

completion of this chart is based on the assumption of atoms. But there
can be no permanent satisfaction to the mind in explaining heat, light, elas-
ticity, diffusion, electricity and magnetism, in gases, liquids, and solids, and

describing precisely the relations of these different states of matter to one

another by statistics of gxeat numbers of atoms, when the properties of the

atom itself are simply assumed. When the theory, of which we have the first

instalment in Clausius and Maxwell's work, is complete, wo are but brought
face to face with a superlatively grand question, what is the inner me-

chanism of the atom ?

   In the answer to this question we must find the explanation not only

of the atomic elasticity, by which the atom is a chronometi-ic vibrator ac-
cording to Stokes's discovery, but of chemical affinity and of the differences
of quality of different chemical elements, at present a mere mystery in

science. Helmholtz's exquisite theory of vortex-motion in au incompressible

frictionlcss liquid has been suggested as a finger-post, pointing a way

which may possibly lead to a fall understanding of the properties of atoms,
carrying out the grand conception of Lucretius, who " admits no subtle

" ethers, no variety of elements with fiery, or watery, or light, or heavy

" principles ; nor supposes light to be one thing, fire another, electricity a
" fluid, magnetism a vital principle, but treats all phenomena as mere pro-
" perties or accidents of simple matter." This statement I take from
an admirable paper on the atomic theory of Lucretius, which appeared in
the ' North British Eeview ' for March 1868, containing a most interesting

and instructive summary of ancient and modern doctrine regarding atoms.

--Allow me to read from that article one other short passage finely describing

the present aspect of atomic theory : " The existence of the chemical
" atom, already quite a complex little world, seems very probable ; and

" the description of the Lucretian atom is wonderfully applicable to it. "VVe

--<' are not wholly without hope that the real weight of each such atom may

" some day be known not merely the relative weight of the several atoms,
<' but the number in a given volume of any material ; that the form and
" motion of the parts of each atom and the distances by which they are
" separated may be calculated ; that the motions by which they produce heat,

" electricity, and light may be illustrated by exact geometrical diagrams ; and

" that the fundamental properties of the intermediate and possibly constituent

" medium may be arrived at. Then the motion of planets and music of the
" spheres will be neglected for a while in admiration of the maze in Avhich

" the tiny atoms run."

Even before this was written some of the anticipated results had been par-

tially attained. Loschmidt in Vienna had sho^wn, and not much latter Stoncy

independently in England showed, how to deduce from Clausius and Max-

well's kinetic theory of gases a superior limit to the number of atoms in a

given measurable space. I was unfortunately quite unaware of what Loschmidt

and Stoney had done when I made a similar estimate on the same founda-

tion, and communicated it to ' Nature ' in an article on " The Size of
Atoms." But questions of personal priority, however interesting they may be

to the persons concerned, sink into insignificance in the prospect of any gain

of deeper insight into the secrets of nature. The triple coincidence of inde-

pendent reasoning in this ease is valuable as confirmation of a conclusion

violently contravening ideas and opinions which had been almost universally

held reo-arding the dimensions of the molecular structure of matter. Che-

mists and other naturalists had been in the habit of evading questions as to

the hardness or indivisibility of atoms by virtually assuming them to bo in-
Wefinitely small and infinitely numerous.
                                           must now no longer look upon

the atom, with Boscovich, as a mystic point endowed with inertia and the

attribute of attracting or repelhng other such centres with forces depending

upon the intervening distances (a supposition only tolerated with the tacit

assumption that the inertia and attraction of each atom is infinitely small and

the number of atoms infinitely great), nor can wo agree with those who have

attributed to the atom occupation of space with infinite hardness and strength

(incredible in any finite body) ; but we must realize it as a piece of matter

of measurable dimensions, with shape, motion, and laws of action, intelligible

subjects of scientific investigation.

   The prismatic analysis of light discovered by Newton was estimated by
himself as being " the oddest, if not the most considerable, detection which
" hath hitherto been made in the operations of nature."

   Had he not been deflected from the subject, he could not have failed

to obtain a pure spectrum ; but this, with the inevitably consequent

discovery of the dark lines, was reserved for the nineteenth century.

Our fundamental knowledge of the dark lines is due solely to Praun-

hofer. Wollastou saw them, but did not discover them. Ijrewster laboured

long and well to perfect the prismatic analysis of sunlight ; and his observa-
tions on the dark bands produced by the absorption of interposed gases and

vapours laid important foundatioiis for the grand superstructure which he

scarcely lived to see. Piazzi Smyth, by spectroscopic observation performed

on the Peak of Tenei-iffe, added greatly to our knowledge of the dark lines

produced in the solar spectrum by the absorption of our own atmosphere.

The prism became an instrirment for chemical qualitative analysis in the
hands of Fox Talbot and Herschel, who first showed how, throirgh it, the

old "blowpipe test" or generally the estimation of substances from the

colours which they give to flames, can be prosecuted with an accuracy

and a discriminating power not to be attained when the colour is judged

by the unaided eye. But the application of this test to solar and stellar

chemistry had never, I believe, been suggested, either directly or indirectly,

by any other naturalist, when Stokes taught it to me in Cambridge at some
time prior to the summer of 1S52. The observational and experimental

foundations on which he built were :

   (1 ) The discovery by Praunhofer of a coincidence between his double dark

Dline of the solar spectrum and a double bright line which he observed in

the spectra of ordinary artificial flames.

  A(2) very rigorous experimental test of this coincidence by Prof. W. H,

Miller, which showed it to be accurate to an astonishing degree of minuteness.

   (3) The fact that the yellow light given out when salt is thrown on burning

spirit consists almost solely of the two nearly identical qualities which con-

stitute that double bright line.

  D(4) Observations made by Stokes himself, which showed the bright line

to be absent in a candle-flame when the wick was snuffed clean, so as not to

project into the luminous envelope, and from an alcohol flame when the spirit
was burned in a watch-glass. And

   (5) Poucault's admirable discovery (L'Institut, Peb. 7, 1849) that the

Dvoltaic arc between charcoal points is "a medium which emits the rays

" on its own account, and at the same time absorbs them when they come

" from another quarter."

   The conclusions, theoretical and practical, which Stokes taught me, and

which I gave regularly afterwards in my public lectures in the University of

Glasgow, were :

    (1) That the double line D, whether bright or dark, is due to vapour of
sodium.

(2) That the ultimate atom of sodium is susceptible of regular elastic vi-

brations, like those of a tuning-fork or of stringed musical instruments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                that
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

like an instrument with two strings tuned to approximate unison, or an ap-

proximately circular clastic disk, it has two fundamental notes or vibrations
XCvi                       KEPORT 1871.

of approximately equal pitch ; and that the periods of these vibrations are

precisely the periods of the t'wo slightly different yellow lights constituting

the double bright line D.

   (3) That when vapour of sodium is at a high enough temperature to be-
come itself a source of light, each atom executes these two fundamental

vibrations simultaneously ; and that therefore the light proceeding from it is

of the two qunlitics constituting the double bright line D.

   (4) That when vapour of sodium is present in space across which light
from another source is propagated, its atoms, according to a weU-known

general principle of dynamics, are set to vibrate in either or both of those

fundamental modes, if some of the incident light is of one or other of their

periods, or some of one and some of the other ; so that the energy of the

waves of those particular qualities of light is converted into thermal vibra-

tions of the medium and dispersed in all directions, while light of all other

qualities, even though very nearly agreeing with them, is transmitted with

comparatively no loss.

  D(5) That Fraunhofers double dark line of solar and stellar spectra is due

to the presence of vapour of sodium in atmospheres surroiinding the sun

and those stars in whose spectra it had been observed.

(G) That other vapours than sodium are to be found in the atmospheres

of sun and stars by searcliing for substances producing in the spectra of

artificial flames bright lines coinciding with other dark lines of the solar

and stellar spectra than the Fraunhofer line D.

The last of these propositions I felt to be confirmed (it was perhaps

partlj' suggested) by a striking and beautiful experiment admirably adapted

for lecture illustrations, due to Foucault, which had been shown to me by

M. Duboscque Soleil, and the Abbe Moigno, in Paris in the month of

AOctober 1850.  prism and lenses were arranged to throw upon a screen

an approximately pure spectrum of a vertical electric are between charcoal

poles of a powerful battery, the lower one of which was hollowed like a cup.

When pieces of copper and pieces of zinc were separately thrown into the

cup, the spectrum exhibited, in perfectly definite positions, magnificent well-

marked bauds of difiercnt colours characteristic of the two metals. AVlien

a piece of brass, compounded of copper and zinc, was put into the cup,

the spectrum showed all the bands, each precisely in the place in which

it had been seen when one metal or the other had been used separately.
   It is much to be regretted that this great generalization was not pub-

lished to the world twenty years ago. I say this, not because it is to bo

regretted that Angstrom should have the credit of having in 1853 pub-

lished independently the statement that " an incandescent gas emits lumi-
" nous rays of the same refrangibility as those which it can absorb " ; or that
Balfour Stewart should have been unassisted by it when, coming to the

subject from a very different point of view, he made, in his extension of the

"Theory of Exchanges"*, the still wider generalization that the radiating

power of every kind of substanee is equal to its absorbing power for every

kind of ray ; or that KirchhofF also should have in 1859 independently dis-
covered the same proposition, and shown its application to solar and stellar

chemistry ; but because we might now be in possession of the inconceivable
riches of astronomical results which we expect fi-om the next ten years'

investigation by spectrum analysis, had Stokes given his theory to the
world when it first occurred to him.

To Kirchhoff belongs, I believe, solely the great credit of having first

actually souglit for and found other metals than sodium in the sun by the
method of spectrum analysis. His publication of October 1859 inaugurated
the practice of solar and stellar chemistry, aud gave spectrum analysis an

impulse to which in a great measure is due its splendidly successful cultivation

by the labours of many able investigators within the last ten years.

                                                                                                                                           o

   To prodigious and wearing toil of Kirchhoff himself, and of Angstrom, wc
owe large-scale maps of the solar spectrum, incomjjarably superior in minute-

ness and accuracy of delineation to any thing ever attempted previously. These

maps now constitute the standards of reference for all workers in the field.

Pliickcr and Hittorf opened ground in advancing the physics of spectrum
analysis and made the important discovery of changes in the spectra of
ignited gases produced by changes in the physical condition of the gas. The
scientific value of the meetings of the British Association is well illustrated
by the fact that it was through conversation with Pliicker at the Newcastle
meeting that Lockyer was first led into the investigation of the eftects of varied

pressure on the quality of the light emitted by glowing gas which he and
Frankland have prosecuted with such admirable success. Scientific wealth
tends to accumulation according to the law of compound interest. Every addi-

tion to knowledge of properties of matter supplies the naturalist with new
instrumental means for discovering and interpreting phenomena of nature,

which in their turn aff'ord foundations for fresh generahzatious, bringing
gains of permanent value into the great storehouse of philosophy. Thus
Frankland, led, from observing the want of brightness of a candle burning in
a tent on the summit of Mont Blanc, to scrutinize Davy's theory of fiame,

discovered tliat brightness Avithout incandescent solid particles is given to a

purely gaseous flame by augmented pressure, and that a dense ignited gas

gives a spectrum comparable with that of the light from an incandescent solid
or liquid. Lockyer joined him; aud the two found that every incandescent

--substance gives a continuous spectrum that an incandescent gas under

varied pi'essure gives bright bars across the continuous spectrum, some of
which, from the sharp, hard and fast hues observed where the gas is in a
state of extreme attenuation, broaden out on each side into nebulous bands
as the density is increased, and are ultimately lost in the continuous spec-
trum when the condensation is pushed on till the gas becomes a fluid no
longer to be called gaseous. Moi-c recently they have examined the influence
 of temperature, and have obtained results which seem to show that a highly
attenuated gas, which at a high temperature gives several bright lines, gives
a smaller and smaller number of lines, of sufiiciont brightness to be visible,
when the temperature is lowered, the density being kept unchanged. I cannot

refrain here from remarking how admirably this beaiitiful investigation har-

monizes with Andrews' great discovery of continuity between the gaseous

and liquid states. Such things make the life-blood of science. In contem-
plating them we feel as if led out from narrow waters of scholastic dogma to
a refreshing excursion on the broad and deep ocean of truth, where we learn
from the wonders wc see that there are endlessly more and more glorious

 wonders still unseen.

     Stokes' dynamical theory supplies the key to the i^hilosophy of Frank-

land and Lockyer's discovery. Any atom of gas when struck and left to

 itself vibrates with perfect purity its fundamental note or notes. In a
 highly attenuated gas each atom is very rarely in collision Avith other
 atoms, and therefore is nearly at all times in a state of true vibration.
 Hence the spectrum of a highly attenuated gas consists of one or more
 perfectly sharp bright lines, with a scarcely perceptible continuous gradation
xcviii  --REPORT 1871.

of prismatic colour. In. denser gas each atom is frequently in collision, but

still is for much more time free, iu intervals between collisions, than engaged

in collision ; so that not only is the atom itself thrown sensibly out of tuue

during a sensible proportion of its whole time, but the confused jangle of

vibrations in every variety of period during the actual collision becomes more

considerable in its influence. Hence bright lines in the spectrum broaden

out somewhat, and the continuous spectrum becomes less faint. In still

denser gas each atom may be almost as much time in collision as free, and

the spectrum then consists of broad nebulous bauds crossing a continuous

spectrum of considerable brightness, "\^^hen the medium is so dense that

each atom is alwaj's in collision, that is to say never free from influence of

its neighbours, the spectrum wiU. generally be continuous, and may present

little or no ap])earance of bands, or even of maxima of brightness. In this

condition the fluid can be no longer regarded as a gas, and we must judge

of its relation to the vaporous or liquid states according to the critical

conditions discovered by Andi'cws.

While these great investigations of properties of matter were going on,

naturalists were not idle with the newly recognized power of the spectro-

scope at their service. Chemists soon followed the example of Bunsen

in discovering new metals in terrestrial matter by the old blow-pipo and

prism test of Fox Talbot and Herschel. Biologists applied spectrum analysis

to animal and vegetable chemistry, and to sanitary investigations. But

it is in astronomy that spectroscopic research has been carried on with

the greatest activity, and been most richly rewarded with results. The

chemist and the astronomer have joined their forces. An astronomical ob-

servatory has now, appended to it, a stock of reagents such as hitherto was

Aonly to be found in the chemical laboratory,  devoted corps of volunteers

of all nations, whose motto might well be ^ibique, have directed their artil-

lery to every region of the universe. The sun, the spots on his surface,

the corona and the red and yellow prominences seen round him during

total eclipses, the moon, the planets, comets, auroras, nebulae, white

stars, yellow stars, red stars, variable and temporary stars, each tested by the

prism was compelled to show its distinguishing colours. Earely before in

the history of science has enthusiastic perseverance directed by penetra-

tive genius produced within ten years so brilliant a succession of dis-

coveries. It is not merely the chemistry of sun and stars, as first sug-

gested, that is subjected to analysis by the spectroscope. Their whole laws

of being are now subjects of direct investigation ; and already we have

glimpses of their evolutional history through the stuj)endous power of this

Wemost subtle and delicate test.    had only solar and stellar chemistry;

we now have solar and stellar physiology.

It is an old idea that the colour of a star may be influenced by its motion

relatively to the eye of the spectator, so as to be tinged with red if it moves

from the earth, or blue if it moves towards the earth. William Allen Miller,

Huggins, and JIaxwell showed how, by aid of the spectroscope, this idea may

be made the foundation of a method of measuring the relative velocity with

which a star approaches to or recedes from the earth. The principle is, first to

identify, if possible, one or more of the lines in the spectrum of the star, with a

line or lines in the spectrum of sodium, or some other terrestrial substance,

and then (by observing the star and the artificial light simultaneously by

the same spectroscope) to find the difference, if any, between their refran-

gibilities. From this difference of refrangibility the ratio of the periods of

the two lights is calculated, according to data determined by Fraunhofer from

comparisons between the positions of the dark lines in the prismatic spectrum

and in his own " interference spectrum " (produced by substituting for the

Aprism a fine grating).  first comparatively rough application of the test by

Miller and Huggins to a large number of the principal stars of our skies,

including Aldcbaran, a Ononis, ft Pegasi, Sirius, n Lyras, CapeUa, Arcturus,
Pollux, Castor (which they had observed rather for the chemical purpose than

for this), proved that not one of them had so great a velocity as 315 kilometres

per second to or from the earth, which is a most momentous result in respect

to cosmical dynamics. Afterwards Huggins made special observations of

the velocity test, and succeeded in making the measurement in one case,

that of Sirius, which he then found to be receding from the earth at the rate

of G(j kilometres per second. This, corrected for the velocity of the earth at

the time of the observation, gave a velocity of Sirius, relatively to the Sun,

amounting to 47 kilometres per second. The minuteness of the difference to

be measured, and the smallness of the amount of light, even when the brightest

star is observed, renders the observation extremely difficult. Still, with

such great skill as Mr. Huggins has brought to bear on the investigation,

it can scarcely be doubted that velocities of many other stars may be
measured. "What is now wanted is, certainly not greater skill, perhaps not

even more 2}owerful instruments, but more instruments and more ohservers.

Lockyer's applications of the velocity test to the relative motions of different

gases in the Sun's photosphere, spots, chromosjihere, and chromosphcric pro-

minences, and his observations of the varying spectra presented by the same

substance as it moves from one position to another in the Sun's atmosphere,

and his interpretations of these observations, according to the laboratory

results of Frankland and himself, go far towards confirming the conviction

that in a few years all the marvels of tlie Sun will be dynamically explained

according to known properties of matter.

During six or eight precious minutes of time, spectroscopes have been ap-

plied to the solar atmosphere and to the corona seen round the dark disk of

the Moon eclipsing the Sun. Some of the wonderful results of such obser-

vations, made in India on the occasion of the eclipse of August 1808, were

described by Professor Stokes in a previous address. Yaluablo results have,

through tlie liberal assistance given by the British and American Govern-

ments, been obtained also from the total eclipse of last December, notwith-

standing a generally unfavourable condition of weather. It seems to have

been proved that at least some sensible part of the light of the "corona" is a

terrestrial atmospheric halo or dispersive reflection of the light of the glow-

ing hydrogen and " helium"* round the sun. I believe I may say, on the

present occasion when preparation must again be made to iitilize a total

eclipse of the Sun, that the British Association confidently trusts to our

Government exercising the same wise liberality as heretofore in the interests

of science.

The old nebular hypothesis supposes the solar system, and other similar

systems through the universe which we see at a distance as stars, to have

originated in the condensation of fiery nebulous matter. This hypothesis

was invented before the discovery of thermo-dynamics, or the nebulic v\'ould

not have been supposed to be fiery ; and the idea seems never to have

occurred to any of its inventors or early supporters that the matter, the con-

densation of Avhich they supposed to constitute the Sun and stars, could have

been other than fiery in the beginning. Mayer first suggested that the heat

of the Sun may be due to gravitation : but he supposed meteors falling in

to keep always generating the heat which is radiated year by year from the

Sun. Helmholtz, on the other hand, adopting the nebular hypothesis, showed

in 1854 that it was not necessary to suppose the nebulous matter to have

been originally fiery, but that mutual gravitation between its parts may

have generated the heat to which the present high temperature of the Sun is

due. Turther he made the important observations that the potential energy

of gravitation in the Sun is even now far from exhausted ; but that with

further and further shrinking more and more heat is to bo generated, and

that thus we can conceive the Sun even now to possess a sufficient store of

energy to produce heat and light, almost as at present, for several million

years of time future. It ought, however, to be added that this condensation

can only follow from cooling, and therefore that Helmholtz's gravitational

explanation of future Sun-heat amounts really to showing that the Sun's

thermal capacity is enormously greater, in virtue of the mutual gravitation

between the parts of so enormous a mass, than the sum of the thermal capa-

cities of separate and smaller bodies of the same material and same total

mass. Eeasons for adopting this theory, and the consequences which follow

from it, are discussed in an article " On the Age of the Sun's Heat," published

in ' Macmillan's Magazine ' for March 1862.

the first place driven, by consideration of the very approximate constancy of

the Earth's period of revolution round the Sun for the last 2000 years, to

conclude that " The principal source, perhaps the sole appreciably eftective

" source of Sun-heat, is in bodies circulating round the Sun at present inside

" the Earth's orbit"* ; and because Le Verricr's researches on the motion of

the planet Mercury, though giving evidence of a sensible influence attributable

to matter circulating as a great number of small planets within his orbit

round the Sun, showed that the amoimt of matter that could possibly be as-

sumed to circulate at any considerable distance from the Sun must be very

small ; and therefore " if the meteoric influx taking place at present is

" enough to pi-oduce any appreciable portion of the heat radiated away, it

" must be supposed to be from matter circulating round the Sun, within very

" short distances of his surface. The density of this meteoric cloud would

" have to be siipposed so great that comets could scarcely have escaped as
" comets actually have escaped, showing no discoverable effects of resistance,

" after passing his surface within a distance equal to one-eighth of his radius.

" All things considered, there seems little probability in the hypothesis that

" solar radiation is compensated to any appreciable degree, by heat generated

" by meteors falling in, at pi-esent ; and, as it can be shown that no chemical
" theory is tenablef, it must be concluded as most probable that the Sun is

" at present mere an incandescent liquid mass cooling "J.
   Thus on purelj- astronomical grounds was I long ago led to abandon as

very improbable the hypothesis that the Sun's heat is supplied dynamically

from year to year by the influx of meteors. Eut now spectrum analysis gives

proof finally conclusive against it.

spiral path, mid beforo roacliing the Sim must liave been for a long time

exposed to an cuorinoiis heating effect from liis radiatiou when very near,

and must thus have been driven into vapour before aetuall}^ falling into the

Sun. Thus, if Mayer's hypothesis is corroyt, friction between vortices of

meteoric vapours and the Sun's atmosphere must be the immediate cause of

solar heat ; and the velocity with which these vapours circulate round equa-

torial parts of the Sun must amount to 435 kilometres per second. The

spectrum test of velocity applied by Lockyci' sliowed but a twentieth part of

this amount as the greatest observed relative velocity between different

vapours in the Sun's atmosphere.

At the first Liverpool Meeting of the British Association (1854), in ad-

vancing a gravitational theory to account for all the heat, light, and motions

of the universe, I urged that the immediately antecedent condition of the

matter of which the Sun and Planets were formed, not being fiery, could not

have been gaseous ; but that it probably was solid, and may have been like
the meteoric stones which we still so frequently meet with through space.

The discovery of Huggins, that the light of the nebute, so far as hitherto

sensible to us, proceeds from incandescent hydrogen and nitrogen gases, and

that the heads of comets also give us light of incandescent gas, seems at first

sight literally to fulfil that part of the nebular hypothesis to which I had

objected. But a solution, which seems to me in the highest degree probable,

has been suggested by Tait. He supposes that it may be by ignited gaseous

exhalations proceeding from the collision of meteoric stones that Nebnlte and

the heads of comets show themselves to us ; and he suggested, at a former
meeting of the Association, that experiments should be made for the purpose

of applying spectrum analysis to the light which has been observed in

gunnery trials, such as those at Shoeburyuess, when iron stiikes against iron

at a great velocity, but varied by substituting for the iron various solid

materials, metallic or stony. Hitherto this suggestion has not been acted

upon                          but surely it is one the  carrying out of  which  ought  to be  pi'omoted
                           ;

by the British Association.

Most important steps have been recently made towards the discovery of the

nature of comets, establishing with nothing short of certainty the truth of a

h)'pothesis which had long appeared to me probable, that they consist of groups

of meteoric stones, accounting satisfactorily for the light of the nucleus,

and giving a simple and rational explanation of phenomena presented by

the tails of comets which had been regarded by the greatest astronomers as

almost preternaturally marvellous. The meteoric hypothesis to which I have

referred remained a mere hypothesis (I do not know that it was ever even

published) until, in 1866, Schiaparelli calculated, from observations on the

August meteors, an orbit for these bodies which he found to agree almost

perfectly with the orbit of the great comet of 1802 as calculated by Oppolzer
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

and so discovered and demonstrated that a comet consists of a group of

meteoric stones. Professor Xewton, of Yale College, United States, by examin-

ing ancient records, ascertained that in periods of about thirty-three years,

since the year 902, there have been exceptionally brilliant displays of the

November meteors. It had long been believed that these interesting visi-

tants came from a train of small detached planets circulating round the Sun

all in nearly the same orbit, and constituting a belt analogous to Saturn's

ring, and that the reason for the comparatively large number of meteors

which we observe annually about the 14th of November is, that at that

time the earth's orbit cuts through the supposed meteoric belt. Professor

Newton concluded from his investigation that there is a denser part of

1871.                                                                                  h

the group of meteors which extends over a portion of the orbit so great

as to occupy about one-tenth ,or one-fifteenth of the periodic time in

passing any particular point, and gave a choice of five different periods for

the revolution of this meteoric stream round the sun, any one of which would

satisfy his statistical result. He further concluded that the line of nodes

(that is to say, the line in which the plane of the meteoric belt cuts the plane
of the Earth's orbit) has a progressive sidereal motion of about 52"-4 per

annum.  Here, then, was  a  splendid  problem  for the physical  astronomer
                                                                                                              ;

and, happily, one well qualified for the task, took it up. Adams, by the

application of a beautiful method invented by Gauss, found that of the five

periods allowed by Newton just one permitted the motion of the line of nodes

to be explained by the disturbing influence of Jupiter, Saturn, and other
planets. The period chosen on these grounds is 33| years. The inves-

tigation showed further that the form of the orbit is a long ellipse, giving

for shortest distance from the Sun 145 million kilometres, and for longest
distance 2895 million kilometres. Adams also worked out the longitude

of the perihelion and the inclination of the orbit's plane to the plane of the

ecliptic. The orbit which he thus found agreed so closely with that of

Temple's Comet I. 1866 that he was able to identify the comet and the

meteoric belt *. The same conclusion had been pointed out a few weeks

earlier by Schiaparelli, from calculations by himself on data supplied by

direct observations on the meteors, and independently by Peters from calcu-

lations by Lcverrier on the same foundation. It is therefore thoroughly

established that Temple's Comet 1. 1806 consists of an eUiijtic train of minute

planets, of which a few thousands or millions fall to the earth annually about

Wethe 14th of November, when we cross their track.  have probably not

yet passed through the very nucleus or densest part ; but thirteen times, in

Octobers and Novembers, from October 13, a.d. 902, to November 14, 1866

inclusive (this last time having been correctly predicted by Prof Newton),

Ave have passed through a part of the belt greatly denser than the average.

The densest part of the train, when near enough to us, is visible as the head

of the comet. This astounding result, taken along mth Huggins's spectro-

scopic observations on the light of the heads and tails of comets, confirms

most strikingly Tait's theory of comets, to which I have already referred

according to which the comet, a group of meteoric stones, is self-luminous
in its nucleus, on account of collisions among its constituents, while its " tail

is merely a portion of the less dense part of the train illuminated by sunlight,

and visible or invisible to us according to circumstances, not only of density,

degree of illumination, and nearness, but also of tactic arrangement, as of a

flock of birds or the edge of a cloud of tobacco-smoke ! "Wliat prodigious diffi-

culties are to be explained, you may judge from two or three sentences which

   * Signer Schiaparelli, Director of the Observatory of Milan, who, in a letter dated Slst
December LS66, pointed out that the elements of the orbit of the Angust Meteors, calcu-
lated from the observed position of their radiant point on tlic supposition of the orbit
being a very elongated ellipse, agreed very closely veith those of the orbit of Comet II. 1862,

calculated by Dr. Oppolzer. In the same letter Schiaparelli gives elements of the orbit
of the November meteors, but these veere not suiTiciently accurate to enable him to identify

the orbit vrith that of any knovfn comet. On the 21st January, 1867, M. Leverrier gave
more accurate elements of the orbit of the November Meteors, and in the ' Astronomiscbo
Nachricliten ' of January 9, Mr. C. F. W. Peters, of Altona, pointed out that these elements
closely agreed with those of Temple's Comet (I 18G6), calculated by Dr. Oppolzer; and

on February 2, Schiaparelli having recalculated the elements of the orbit of the meteors,

himself noticed the same agreement. Adams arrived quite independently at the conclusion

that the orbit of 33^ years period is the one which must be chosen out of the five indi-
cated by Prof. Nevrton. His calculations were sufficiently advanced before the letters

I shall read from Herschd's Astronomy, and from the fact that even SchiapareUi
seems still to believe in the repulsion. " There is, beyond question, some
" pi-ofound secret and mystery of nature concerned in the phenomenon of

" their tails. Perhaps it is not too much to hope that future observation,

" borrowing every aid from rational speculation, grounded on the progress of
" physical science generally (especially those branches of it which relate to

" the ethereal or imponderable elements), may enable us ere long to penetrate

'' this mystery, and to declare whether it is really matter in the ordinary
" acceptation of the term which is projected from their heads with such
" extraordinaiy velocity, and if not impelUcl, at least directed, in its course,
" by reference to the Sun, as its point of avoidance " *.

    " In no respect is the question as to the materiality of the tail more for-
" cibly pressed on us for consideration than in that of the enormous sweep
" which it makes round the sun in perihelio in the manner of a straight and

" rigid rod, in defiance of the laiu of gravitation, nay, even, of the receivedlaws

"of motion"*.
   " The projection of this ray . . . to so enormous a length, in a single day,

" conveys an impression of the intensity of the forces acting to produce such
'· a velocity of material transfer through space, such as no other natural phe-

" nomenon is capable of exciting. It is clear that if weJiave to deal here with
" matter, such as we conceive it (viz. possessing inertia^, at all, it must be under
" the dominion of forces incomparably more energetic than gravitation, and

" quite of a different nature " t.
   Think, now, of the admirable simplicity with which Tait's beautiful " sea-

bird analogy," as it has been caUed, can explain all these phenomena.

   The essence of science, as is weU illustrated by astronomy and

cosmical physics, consists in inferring antecedent conditions, and an-
ticipating future evolutions, from phenomena which have actually come
under observation. In biology the difficulties of successfully acting up
to this ideal are prodigious. The earnest naturalists of the present day

are, however, not appalled or paralyzed by them, and are struggling boldly
and laboriously to pass out of the mere " ISTatural History stage " of

their study, and bring zoology within the range of Xatural Philosophy.

A very ancient speculation, stiU clung to by many naturalists (so much so

that I have a choice of modern terms to quote in expressing it), supposes that,
under meteorological conditions very different from the present, dead matter

may have run together or crystallized or fermented into "germs of life,"

or " organic cells," or " protoplasm." But science brings a vast mass of in-
ductive evidence against this hypothesis of spontaneous generation, as you

have heard from my predecessor in the Presidential chair. Careful enough

scrutiny has, in every case up to the present day, discovered life as antecedent
to life. Dead matter cannot become living without coming under the influ-

ence of matter previously alive. This seems to me as sure a teaching of science

as the law of gravitation. I utterly repudiate, as opposed to all philosophical
uniformitarianism, the assumption of " different meteorological conditions "

that is to say, somewhat different vicissitudes of temperature, pressure,

referred to appeared, to show that the other four orbits offered by Newton were inadmissible.
But the calculations to be gone through to find the secular motion of the node in such an
elongated orbit as that of the meteors were necessarily very long, so that they were not
completed till about March 1867. They were communicated in that mouth to the
Cambridge Philosophical Society, and in the month following to the Astronomical

Society.

--moisture, gaseous atmosphere to produce or to permit that to take place by

force or motion of dead matter alone, which is a direct contravention of what

seems to us biological law. I am prepared for the answer, " our code of
" biological law is an expression of our ignorance as weU as of our know-
" ledge." And I say yes : search for spontaneous generation out of inorganic

 materials ; let any one not satisfied with the purely negative testimony, of

 which we have now so much against it, throw himself into the inquiry. Such
 investigations as those of Pasteur, Pouchet, and Bastian are among the most

 interesting and momentous in the whole range of Natiu'al History, and their
 results, whether positive or negative, must richly reward the most careful

 and laborious experimenting. I confess to being deeply impressed by the

 evidence put before us by Professor Huxley, and I am ready to adopt, as an

 article of scientific faith, true through all space and through all time, that

 life proceeds from life, and from nothing but life.

    How, then, did life originate on the Earth ? Tracing the physical history
 of the Earth backwards, on strict dynamical principles, we are brought to a
'red-hot melted globe on which no life could exist. Hence when the Earth
 was first fit for life, there was no living thing on it. There were rocks solid and
 disintegrated, water, air all round, warmed and illuminated bj^ a brilliant Sun,

 ready to become a garden. Did grass and trees and flowers sjiring into exist-

 ence, in all the fulness of ripe beauty, by a fiat of Creative Power? or did vege-
 tation, growing up from seed sown, spread and nniltii^ly over the whole Earth ?
 Science is bound, by the everlasting law of honour, to face fearlessly every pro-
 blem which can fairly be presented to it. If a probable solution, consistent
 with the ordinary course of nature, can be found, we must not invoke an abnor-
 mal act of Creative Power. "When a lava stream flows down the sides of Vesu-
 vius or Etna it quickly cools and becomes solid ; and after a few weeks or
 years it teems Avith vegetable and auimal life, which for it originated by the
 transport of seed and ova and by the migration of individual living creatures.

 When a volcanic island springs up from the sea, and after a few years is

 found clothed Avith vegetation, we do not hesitate to assume that seed has

 been wafted to it through the air, or floated to it on rafts. Is it not possible,
 and if possible, is it not probable, that the beginning of vegetable life on the
 Earth is to be similarly explained ? Every year thousands, probably mil-

--lions, of fragments of solid matter fall upon the Earth Avhcnce came these

 fragments ? What is the jn-cA-ious history of any one of them ? Was it created

 in the beginning of time an amorphous mass ? This idea is so unacceptable

 that, tacitly or explicitly, all men discord it. It is often assumed that all,

 and it is certain that some, meteoric stones are fragments which had been
 broken off' from greater masses and laimched free into space. It is as sure
 that collisions must occur between great masses moving through space as it
 is that ships, steered without inteUigcnce directed to prevent colhsion, could
 not cross and recross the Atlantic for thousands of years Avith immunity from

 collisions. When tAvo great masses come into collision in space it is certain

 that a large part of each is melted ; but it seems also quite certain that in

many cases a large quantity of debris must be shot forth in all directions,
 much of Avliich may have experienced no greater violence than individual
 pieces of rock experience in a land-slip or in blasting by gunpowder. Should

 the time Avhen this Earth comes into collision Avith another body, comparable
 in dimensions to itself, be Avhcn it is i-lill clolhed as at present with vege-

 tation, many great and small fragments carrying seed and living plants and
 animals would undoubtedly be scattered throueh space. Hence and lecanse

immemorial, many worlrls of life besides our own, wc must rcp,'ard it as pro-

bable in the highest degree that there are countless seed-bearing meteoric

stones moving about through space. If at the present instant no life existed

upon this Earth, one such stone falling upon it might, by what we blindly
call natural causes, lead to its becoming covered with vegetation. I am fully
conscious of the manj'^ scientific objections which may be urged against this

hypothesis ; but I believe them to be all answerable. I have already taxed

your patience too severely to allow me to think of discussing any of them on

the present occasion. The hypothesis that life originated on this Earth
through moss-grown fragments from the ruins of another world may seem

wild and visionarj^ ; all I maintain is that it is not unscientific.

  From the Earth stocked with such vegetation as it could receive meteorieally,

to the Earth teeming with all the endless variety of plants and animals which

now inhabit it, the step is prodigious yet, according to the doctrine of conti-
                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

nuity, most ably laid before the Association by a predecessor in this Chair

(Mr. Grove), all creatures noAV living on earth have proceeded by orderly
evolution from some such origin. Darwin concludes his great work on ' The

--Origin of Species ' with the following words : " It is interesting to contem-

" plate an entangled bank clothed with many plants of many kinds, with

'' birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with

" worms crawling through the damp earth, and to reflect that these elabo-
" rately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent on

*' each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting
" around us." . . . . " There is grandeur in this view of life with its
" several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few
" forms or into one ; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on accord-
" ing to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms,
" most beautiful and most wonderful, have been and are being evolved."
With the feeling expressed in these two sentences I most cordially sympathize.
I have omitted two sentences which come between them, describing briefly
the hypothesis of " the origin «f species by natural selection," because I
have always felt that this hypothesis does not contain the true theory of

evolution, if evolution there has been, in biology. Sir John Herschcl, in
expressing a favourable judgment on the hypothesis of zoological evolution
(with, however, some reservation in respect to the origin of man), objected to
the doctrine of natural selection, that it was too like the Laputan method of
making books, and that it did not sufficiently take into account a continually

guiding and controlling intelligence. This seems to me a most valuable and

instructive criticism. I feel profoundly convinced that the argument of
design has been greatly too much lost sight of in recent zoological specula-
tions. Eeaction against the frivolities of teleology, such as are to be found,
not rarelj% in the notes of the learned commentators on Paley's ' Natural
Theology,' has I believe had a temporary eftcct in turning attention from the
 solid and irrefragable argument so well put forward in that excellent old book.
 But overpoweringly ·trong proofs of intelligent and benevolent design lie
all round us ; and if ever perplexities, whether metaphysical or scientific, turn
us away from them for a time, they come back upon us with irresistible
 force, showing to us through Kature the influence of a free will, and teaching
 us that all living beings depend en one ever-acting Creator and Euler.

--Seventh Report of the Committee for Exploring Kent's Cavern, Devon-

   F.R.S., John Evans, F.R.S., Edward Vivian, George Busk,

During the year which has elapsed since the Sixth Eeport was sent in

(Liverpool, 1870), the Committee have without intermission carried on

their researches, and have strictly followed the mode of working with which

the exploration was commenced in 1865. The Superintendents have con-

tinued to visit the Cavern, and to record the results daily ; they have, as

from the beginning, sent Monthly Reports to the Chairman of the Com-

mittee ; the work has been carried on by the same workmen, George Smerdon
and John Farr, who have discharged their duties in a most efficient and

satisfactory manner ; and the Cavern is as much resorted to as ever by visitors

feeling an interest in the researches.

In June 1871, Mr. Busk, a Member of the Committee, spent some time

at Torquay, when he visited the Cavern accompanied by the Superintendents,

who took him through all its branches, explored and vinexplored. Having

carefuUy watched the progress of the work, and made himself familiar with

all its details, he spent some time at the Secretary's residence, examining and

identifying a portion of the mammalian remains which had been disinterred.

In November 1870 the Superintendents had also the pleasure of going

through the cavern with Mr. W. Morrison, M.P., who takes so active an

interest in the exploration of the caves near Settle in Yorkshire.

Besides the foregoing, and exclusive of the large number attended by the

guide appointed by the proprietor, Sir L. Palk, Bart., M.P., the Cavern has

been visited during the year by the Earl and Countess Russell, Sir R. Sin-

clair, Bart., Sir C. Trevelyan, Mr. C. Gilpin, M.P., Governor Wayland, U.S.,

Colonel Ward, Major Bryce, U.S., Rev. Mr. Dickenson, Rev. E. N. Dumble-

   Smerdons Passaije. The Committee stated in their last Report that, in
excavating the "North Sally-port," they had been led to a third External En-
trance to the Cavern, in the same limestone cliff as the two Entrances known
from time immemorial, but at a considerably lower level, where it was com-
pletely buried in a great talus of debris. After adding that it had not been
thought necessary, or desirable, or even safe to dig through the talus to the
open day, they stated the facts which left no doubt of their having pene-
trated to the outside of the Cavern. During the winter of 1870-71, the
question of the existence of the third Entrance was put beyond all doubt
for, after a considerable rainfall, that portion of the talus which the workmen
had undermined fell in, and thereby laid open the Entrance. This cavity
was at once filled up, in order to prevent any one from intruding into the

Cavern.

   It was also stated last year that the new or low-level opening was the

External Entrance not only of the North SaUy-port, but of another and
unsuspected branch of the Cavern, to which had been given the name of
" Smerdon's Passage," the exploration of which had been begun.

   This Passage was found to consist of two Reaches, the first, or outermost,
being about 25 feet long, from 3 to 10 feet wide, and having a northerly
direction. Near its entrance, or southern end, there are in the roof a few
circular holes, from 6 to 12 inches in diameter, apparently the mouths of
tortuous shafts extending for some distance into, or perhaps through, the
limestone rock. The roof itself and the adjacent portions of the wall bear
traces of the long- continued erosive action of running water, but below the
uppermost 12 or 18 inches the walls have many sharp angular inequa-
lities. Further in, the roof has an irregular fretted aspect, apparently the

result of the corrosive action of acidulated water, whilst the walls retain the
angular appearance just mentioned.

   The Second lleach runs nearly east and west, is about 32 feet long, some-
what wider than the first, and its roof is several feet higher. At its outer or
eastern end the roof and walls are much fretted ; further in, there are holes

in the roof similar to those just mentioned, with the exception of being

larger. Some of them contain a small quantity of soil, resembling
Cave-earth, and firmly cemented to the wall ; whilst adjacent to others
there is a considerable amount of stalactitic matter. Still further in, the
roof, which has the aspect of a watercourse, is covered with a thin veneer
of white stalactite ; and near the inner cud there is a considerable hole in
the roof containing a large accumulation of the same material.

    At the western or inner end of this Second Ecach, the limestone roof gave
place to one consisting of angular pieces of limestone cemented with carbo-
nate of Ume into a very firm concrete. In breaking this up, the workman
thrust his iron bar up through it, and found he had thereby opened a pas-
sage into the easfern end of that branch of the Cavern known as the " Sloping
Chamber," the concrete floor of which was at the same time the roof of the

Passage,

   At the outer or eastern end of the Second Eeach there was found another
Low-level Entrance, about 20 feet from that previously mentioned, and
having no marks of the action of water.

    Narrow ramifications extend through the limestone rock from both Reaches
of Smerdon's Passage (westward from the first, and southwards from the
ON Kent's cavern^ Devonshire.  3

second) and intersect one another ; their roofs are also perforated with holes,
and exhibit traces of the action of running water.

   Throughout both Reaches there were in certain places strips of Stalag-

mitic Floor extending continuously across from waU to waU, and varying

from a quarter of an inch to 6 inches in thickness. The most important
of these strips was about 8 feet long. Elsewhere the Cave-earth was either
completely bare, or had on it here and there what may be called conical
scales of stalagmite, from 3 to 12 inches in diameter at the base, and from
1 to 4 inches in thickness at the centre. From them, and generally near
the middle, there not unfrequently rose one or more rudely cylindi-ical
masses of the same material, sometimes 9 inches high, 6 inches in circum-
ference, and locally known as " Cow's Paps." In almost every instance of
the kind there depended from the limestone roof, vertically over them, a
long, slender, quill-like tube of stalactite, occasionally reaching and uniting
with the " Paps." Such tubes occurred also in certain places where there
were no " Paps," and in some spots there was quite a forest of them, ex-
tending from the roof to the Stalagmitic Floor. Wherever it was possible
to excavate the deposit beneath without breaking them, they were left
intact. In some cases the Stalagmitic Floor, or the Cave- earth where the
latter was bare, reached the roof ; and where this was not the case, the unoc-
cupied space was rarely more than a foot in height.

   About midway in the Second Reach there was on each wall a remnant

of an old floor of stalagmite, about 8 inches above the floor found intact,
fuUy 6 iaches thick, about 6 feet in length, and within a few inches of the

roof.

   The mechanical deposit in the Passage was the ordinary red Cave-earth,
in some places sandy, but occasionally a very compact clay. It contained a
considerable number of angular fragments of limestone, numerous blocks of
old crystalline stalagmite, and a few well-rolled pebbles of quartz, red grit,
and flint. The masses of limestone were not unfrequently of considerable
size ; indeed one of them required to be blasted twice, and another three
times, in order to effect their removal ; and some of the blocks of stalagmite
measured fully 15 cubic feet.

   From the entrance of the First Reach to about 10 feet within it, the
upper surface of the Cave-earth was almost perfectly horizontal ; but from

the latter point it rose irregularly higher and higher, until, at the inner end
of the Second Reach, the increased height amounted to about 9 feet. There
were no tunnels or burrows in the deposit, such as occurred in both the
Sally-ports, and were described in the Fifth and Sixth Reports (1869 and
1870). Near the inner end of the Second Reach the Cave-earth adjacent to
the walls was cemented into a concrete.

    The deposit in the lateral ramifications of the Passage was the same typi-
cal Cave-earth, containing blocks of old crystalline stalagmite and angular
pieces of limestone, but -without any Stalagmitic Floor.

    It was stated in the Sixth Report (1870), p. 26, that at the third External
Entrance, i. e. the first of the low-level series, the deposits were of two

--kinds the ordinary Cave-earth, with the usual osseous remains, below ; and

small angular pieces of limestone, with but little earth and no fossils, above.
Materials of precisely the same character, and in the same order, were found

at the new low-level Entrance, at the eastern end of the Second Reach of

Smerdon's Passage, as already stated.

    Besides a large number of bones, portions of bones, and fragments of
 antlers, a total of fully 2900 teeth were found in the Passage and its rami-

                                                                         b2

   On comparing the foregoing list with those given for the Sally-ports in

the Sixth Report (pp. 19 and 24), it will be found to differ from them in
containing neither Sheep nor Pig, and in the diminished prevalence of Rabbit

and Badger.

   Many of the teeth are in fragments of jaws, which have, in most cases,

lost their condyles and their inferior borders. They belong to individuals of
all ages, from the baby Elephant, whose molar crown was no more than -8
inch long, and the Hyaena, whose second set had made their appearance
before the dislodgement of the first, to the wasted remnant of an adult tooth
of the Mammoth, and the canine of the Bear worn quite to the fang.

   Many of the bones and teeth are discoloured, a large number are gnawed

(generally, no doubt, by the Hysena, but occasionally by some smaller animal),
and a considerable proportion of them, at all levels, are more or less covered

with films of stalagmitic matter. On some of the specimens are peculiar
markings, produced perhaps by fine rootlets of trees having grown round
them. Some marked in this way were found with living rootlets surround-

ing them.

   Coprolitic matter was by no means abundant, only one example of it
having been met with in the entire Passage.

    In various parts of the Passage considerable heaps of small bones, some-
times agglutinated, were found here and there on the surface, or but little

below it. In one instance as many as 8400 were picked out of 120 cubic

inches of material.

   At the junction of the two Reaches of the Passage, a large ledge or cur-
tain of limestone projected downwards from the roof considerably below the
TTSual level. On the inner or northern side of it there was found a wheel-
barrow full of bones, fragments of bones, and teeth, of a considerable variety

of animals, all huddled together.

   It was stated in the First Report (Birmingham, 1865 1) that the Cave-
earth was excavated in " Parallels," the length of which was the same as
the width of the Chamber &c., where this was not excessive, breadth in-

variably 1 foot, and depth 4 feet, where this gave the men siifiicient height
to work in comfort, or 5 feet where it did not ; that each parallel was

divided into successive horizontal " Levels," a foot in depth ; and that each
level was subdivided into lengths or " Yards," each 3 feet long and, from
what has been stated, a foot square in the section, thus rendering it easy
to define and record the position of every object discovered.

    Smerdon's Passage and its lateral branches contained 78 "Parallels " of

ON KENT S CAVERNj DEVONSHIRE.  5

Cave-earth, and, as it was necessary to excavate to the depth of 5 feet*, a
total of 390 separate " foot-levels." The following Table shows the distri-

bution of the teeth of the different kinds of animals in the various " Paral-
lels" and " Levels."

                         .

1 of Bear, 1 of Horse, 1 of " Irisli Elk," 2 jaws of Badger containing four
teeth, bones and fragments of bone, some of which were gnawed and some

invested with films of stalagmite.
    It has been already stated that at its eastern extremity the Second Reach

of Smerdon's Passage terminated in a " low-level " External Entrance, filled

with true Cave-earth below, above which lay an accumulation of smaU an-

gular stones with but little earth. In the lower deposit the ordinary mam-

malian remains were found, including teeth and bones of Hyasna, Horse,
Rhinoceros, " Irish Elk," Ox, Elephant, Bear, and Reindeer ; but the only
thing met with in the materials above was an amber bead, ellipsoidal in form,
but somewhat thicker on one side than the other, -9 inch in greatest dia-
meter and -5 inch in least, and having at its centre a cylindrical perforation

about -2 inch in diameter.

   The excavation of Smerdon's Passage was completed on December 31st,
1870, after very nearly five months having been expended on it. From its
prevalent narrowness, the labour in it had been attended with much dis-

comfort ; but probably no branch of the Cavern had, on the whole, yielded
a larger number of mammalian remains.

  --Minor Ramifications of the North Salh/-port. -It was stated in the Sixth

Report (1870)*, that there were one or two ramifications of the North Sally-
port which had not been excavated, having been passed intentionally in the
progress of the work. To these attention was given on the completion of

--Smerdon's Passage, and they were taken in the order of their proximity to

the " Third External Entrance," the first discovered of the low-level series.
   The first was a small opening in the east wall of the last Reach of the

North Sally-port, having its limestone floor veiy slightly above the top of

the deposit in that Reach. It proved to be a tunnel in the limestone, having
a rudely triangular transverse section, from 2-5 to 3 feet in height and
breadth, and extending eastwards or outwards towards the hill-side for
about 8 feet, where it terminated in material of the same character as that

found above the Cave-earth in the first and second low-level External En-
trances, from the first of which it was about 12 feet distant. There is no

doubt that it is a third of these low-level Entrances, and, to use the time-

honoured phraseology in descriptions of Kent's Hole, it may be termed the
" Oven " Entrance. It contained but little deposit, and the only noteworthy

objects found in it were one tooth of Horse, a few bones and bone fragments,
and a grit pebble.

   The second of these small lateral branches was in the south wall of the
immediately preceding or penultimate Reach of the Sally-port, and was
too narrow to admit of being excavated in " Parallels " and " Levels." In
it were found 7 teeth of Hyaena, 10 of Horse, 3 of Rhinoceros, 1 of Bear,
1 of Lion, 1 of " Irish Elk," 1 of Ox, 16 of Badger in parts of 4 jaws, 10 of
Rabbit in parts of 2 jaws, portion of an antler, a right femur of Beaver,
bones and fragments of bone, a bit of charcoal, and a grit pebble. It is
noteworthy, perhaps, that the fine specimen of Beaver's jaw mentioned last
yearf was found about 4 or 5 feet from the femur just named, and in the

fourth " foot-level."

   The third and last of these lateral ramifications was near that part of the
SaUy-port termed the " Islands "+. It yielded 2 teeth of Hyaena, 1 of
Horse, 3 of Rhinoceros, 1 of Bear, 3 of « Irish Elk," 4 of Deer, 2 of Badger,
4 of Rabbit, an astragalus of Ox, bones and bone fragments, and, in the

uppermost " foot-level," 2 land-sheUs.

ON rent's cavern^ DEVONSHIRE.  7

    On January 17th, 1871, the workmen finally and gladly emerged from the

 labyrinth of low narrow passages in which they had been engaged from day
to day from November 13th, 1869, or upwards of 14 months. In this time
they had not only excavated and taken to the day the deposits, to the depth

of 5 feet, in aU the extensive and ramifying branches known as the North
Sally-port and Smerdon's Passage, and exhumed cartloads of the remains of
various animals, including 5900 of their teeth, as well as 20 flint implements

and flakes, but, beyond the first Reach of the SaUy-port (27 feet long), they

had actually discovered the whole of these branches, including three new

entrances to the Cavern itself, and had thus added greatly, not only to the

extent of Kent's Hole, but to a knowledge of its structure.

    The completion of these branches concluded the excavation, to the depth
of 4 feet generally, and 5 feet in some instances, below the Stalagmitic Floor,

--of the whole of the Eastern Division of the Cavern.
    The Cavern Entrances. Before proceeding to a description of the branch

which next engaged attention, it may be of service to devote a few words to
the Entrances of the Cavern, of which there are now known to be five (two

at a high and three at a low level), aU in the eastern side of the hill, and
within a horizontal distance of 53 feet. Those at the high-level (known
from time immemorial) are about 53 feet apart, almost exactly on the same
level, and about 189 feet above mean tide. The most northerly of them is
that invariably spoken of in all early descriptions of the Cavern as " The
Entrance." Those of the lower series are also at very nearly the same level
with one another, but from 18 to 20 feet below the former two. Being
lower in the sloping hill-side, they are about 24 feet outside or east of the
vertical plane passing through the higher entrances. The most southerly
ones in the two series are nearly in the same east and west vertical plane^

    In order to distingiiish them, they are respectively termed :

  =1. "The Entrance," the more northerly of the upper series, and, from its

form, sometimes termed the " Triangular Entrance." It opens into the
" Vestibule."

   2. The " Arched Entrance," =the more southerly of the upper series.
It opens into the " Great Chamber."

   3. The " First Low-level Entrance,"=the middle one of the lower series
the first discovered. It opens into the " North Sally-port " and the " First

Reach of Smerdon's Passage."

   4. The " Second Low-level Entrance," =the most northerly of the lower
series--the second discovered. It opens into the " Second Reach of Smerdon'9

Passage,"

  = --5. The "Oven Entrance," the most southerly of the lower series the

--last discovered. It opens into the " North Sally-port."
    The Sloping Chamber. That branch of the Cavern termed the " Sloping
Chamber " by Mr. M'Enery was, prior to the Committee's exploration of
the " Great Chamber," the largest apartment in it, and is still, perhaps, more
calculated than any other to impress visitors. It is the only connexion of
the two great divisions of the Cavern, and measures 80 feet from east to
west, 25 in greatest breadth, and, since the excavation of its deposits to the
depth of 4 feet below the base of the Stalagmitic Floor, 25 in greatest
height. Its name was derived from its floor, which, from 20 feet from its
eastern side, sloped rapidly towards its western side, falling as much as 14
feet in 60, or at an average angle of 13°-5. Its ceiling sloped more
rapidly still, being, as already stated, 25 feet high near the eastern wall, but

not more than 6 feet at the western. This ceiling, though representing the
8 REPORT 1871.

--dip of the limestone strata in a general way, is extremely rugged, here re-

treating into deep cavities whence huge masses of limestone have fallen, and

there ornamented with numerous and heavy masses of Stalactite. Indeed

the finest Stalactites in the Cavern occur in it ; and one known as the " Chan-

Adelier" has always been much admired.              very strong light is required,

however, to bring out all the features of the ceiling.

   During the autumn of 1866, the upper, or eastern, or level portion of this

Chamber was explored, and the results were described in the Third Eeport
(Dundee, 1867). Mr. M'Enery, too, had made extensive, no doubt his most
extensive, diggings near the foot of the incline, where he " succeeded in sink-

ing a shaft to the depth of 30 feet at the bottom of the slope, with the view
of reaching the original floor "*, which, however, was not realized. Having
broken the floor for his shaft, and finding the work very laborious, he availed
himself of the opening thus made to extend his diggings eastward, keeping

just beneath the floor, which he left spanning his broken ground like an

arch.

   As it was obvious that a very considerable amount of deposit still remained
intact, it was decided, on the completion of Smerdon's Passage, to resume the

excavation, not only in the hope of obtaining some of the palseontological

treasures with which, according to Mr. M'Enery, the Chamber abounded, but
also as a pre-requisite to the exploration of the " Wolf's Den " and the " Long

Arcade," into which it opened on the north and south respectively.
   The uppermost deposit, as in the adjacent parts of the Cavern, was the

Black Mould so frequently mentioned in all previous Reports ; and as the
Chamber was the only capacious apartment near the Entrance, and the only

road to the Western Division of the Cavern, which, from some cause, seems
to have been more attractive than the Eastern to visitors in, at least, all

recent times t, it might have been expected that many comparatively modern

objects of interest would have been found in the Mould. In reality,how-

--ever, such objects were by no means abundant a fact which may be ex-

phcable, perhaps, on the hypothesis that they had been collected by Mr.

M'Enery and other early explorers. The only things found in this deposit
(which, it may be stated, was of inconsiderable depth) were shells of cockle,

--limpet, and pecten ; two potsherds one black and of coarse clay, the other

brown, in which the clay was finer ; a flint chip and a core of the same ma-

terial; a spindle-whorl of fine-grained micaceous grit, 1'5 inch in diameter,

·5 inch in thickness, and having its external edges rounded off'; and a bone

awl, 3-7 inches long, -7 inch broad at the butt end, and partially covered

with a film of stalagmite.

Beneath the Black Mould came the ordinary floor of granular and lami-

nated stalagmite, in which, as well as in the deposit beneath, the rugged

character of the ceiling suggested that a considerable number of large masses
of limestone would be found. Their presence in the floor, moreover, was

indicated by the nature of its upper surface, which, though a continuous

sheet, with one exception to be noticed hereafter, was so very uneven

as to induce an early guide to the Cavern to confer on it the appellation of
the " Frozen BiUows." Accordingly, the Floor proved to be, with an excep-

^8* See Trans. Devon. Assoc, vol. iii. p.  (1869).
--t The following fact seems to be confirmatory on this point : There are in the various

branches of the Western Division (sometimes in places of diiBciUt access) numerous

--initials and dates on the limestone walls and on bosses of stalagmite some engraved,
--some smoked, and some merely chalked while there are extremely few in the Eastern

Division,

tion here and there, a brecciated mass composed of large and small pieces of
limestone and blocks of the well-known old crystalline stalagmite, all ce-
mented together and covered with a sheet of the cementing material.

    Near the upper part of the slope, and on its southern margin, a space about
14 feet long and varying from 3 to 12 feet broad was without any trace of
floor, but occupied with large loose pieces of limestone. Elsewhere the sheet
was perfectly continuous until reaching the area in which Mr. M'Enery had
dug his shaft. The Floor commonly measured from 12 to 30 inches in thick-
ness, but adjacent to the southern wall it was fuUy 3 feet, and contained few
or no stones.

   On being broken into small pieces and carefully examined, it was found

to contain 2 teeth of Horse, a portion of a jaw, 2 bones, and half of a frac-
tured flint nodule. About 30 feet down the slope, a series of dark parallel
lines were observed in the Floor, the uppermost being about 2 inches below

the upper surface. On the advance of the work, they proved to be continuous

downward, and to have a greater and greater thickness of stalagmite over

them. On careful examination, it was found that each represented what for

a time had been the upper surface of the Stalagmitic Floor of the Chamber,
and was due to the presence of comminuted charcoal and other dark-coloured
extraneous matter. Such a " charcoal streak " also occurred, according to
Mr. M'Enery, in the " Long Arcade," within a few feet of the same spot*.
The workmen were directed to detach a specimen of the Floor where the

streaks were well displayed, and in doing so were so fortunate as to make
their fracture at a place where a large cockle-shell lay firmly imbedded in

the lowest streak, at a depth of about 8 inches below the surface. Whilst

splitting up the Stalagmite on May 16th, 1871, two specimens of well-marked

iern-impressions were found in it, about 3 inches below the surface. Nothing
of the kind had ever been noticed before.

    Below the Stalagmite, as iisual, lay the Cave-earth, in which, as was an-
ticipated, pieces of limestone were unusually abundant. Some of them
"leasured several feet in length and breadth, and were fully 2 feet thick.
There were also numerous blocks of the old crystalline stalagmite, measuring
in some instances upwards of 4 cubic yards, and not unfrequently projecting
from the Cave-earth into the overlying granular floor. Though they were
carefully broken up, nothing was found in them.

    In that portion of the Cave-earth which was found intact, there occurred,
as usual, remains of the ordinary Cave-mammals, including about 550 teeth,

which may be apportioned as in the following Ust :

Hyaena       39 per cent.  Reindeer                 2 per cent.
Horse                                               2

             2-5 ,,        Dog (?) only one tooth.

   It is, perhaps, worthy of remark that though wild animals still frequent
Kent's Hole, and there is reason to believe that some of them have in recent
times carried in the bones of others on which they preyed, though the Sloping
Chamber is near and between the two high-level Entrances, though the
Floor was broken up and thus gave the readiest access to the Cave-earth, and
though Mr. M'Enery discontinued his labours upwards of 40 years ago, of
which more than 30 were years of quietude in the Cavern, there is in the

          to the best the Cavern has yielded in previous years, there are some good
          lanceolate implements amongst them.

             No. 3693 is of light broAvn translucent flint> 1'85 inch in length, '9 inch in
          greatest breadth, -175 inch in greatest thickness, nearly flat on one side, and
          carinated on the other. It vras found with a few bones in the first foot-
          level, amongst loose stones, where there was no Stalagmitic Floor over it

     --hence it may be doubted whether it belongs to the Palffiohthic series a doubt

          strengthened by the modern aspect of the implement.
              No. 3754, of the usual white flint, is 4-2 inches long, -9 inch in greatest

   j^ -N breadth, -3 inch in -greatest thickness, both longitudinally and transversely
^ ' concave on one side, has a medial ridge on the other, from which, at about

          an inch from one end, a second ridge proceeds, and has a thin but uneven
         edge. It was probably pointed at each end, but has unfortunately been
         broken at one of them. It was found on March the 6th, 1871, in the second
          foot-level, with splinters of bone, beneath a Stalagmitic Floor 18 inches

             thick.

           No. 5430, also of white flint, is Somewhat irregular in form, but may be

          termed rudely lanceolate; it is 2*7 inches in length, 1-5 inch in extreme
          breadth, -3 inch in greatest thickness, slightly concave on one face and ir-
         regularly convex on the other. It was found on March 30th, 1871, with 2
          teeth of Horse, 1 of Hyasna, and fragments of bone, in the second " foot-
          level," withont any Stalagmitic Floor over it.

^ No. 3732, a whitish flint, is 2-3 inches long, 1-1 inch in breadth, which is

 N nearly uniform from end to end, slightly concave on one face, convex on the
          other, on which there are three slight, parallel, longitudinal ridges, sharply
          truncated at both ends, but primarily thin at the sides. It was found on
          February 27th, 1871, in the third " foot-level," with a tooth of Hyaena and
          fragments of bone, without any Stalagmitic Floor over it.

.17 o,. j^Q 5435^ a slightly mottled white flint, is 2-1 inches long, 1-1 inch broad,
           ·4 inch in greatest thickness, flat on one face, strongly ridged on the other,
          abruptly truncated at one end, but thin everywhere else, and retains its width
          almost to the opposite end, which is bluntly rounded. It was found on 31st

         March, 1871, with a portion of Deer's jaw and fragments of bone, in the

           third " foot-level," beneath a Stalagmitic Floor, 2 feet thick.
              No. 3687, a mottled flint with white prevailing, is 2-6 inches long, 1-2

           inch in greatest breadth, -3 inch in greatest thickness, broadest near the

          middle, whence it tapers in both directions, somewhat pointed at one end
          but not at the other, nearly flat on one face and convex on the other, on

     --which there are two ridges one subcentral and the other nearly marginal.

          It was found on February 7th, 1871, in the fourth or lowest foot-level, with
          1 tooth of Horse, 1 of Hyaena, and a fragment of bone, without any Stalag-

            mitic Floor over it.

              No. 5475 so closely resembles No. 3732, mentioned above, jis to need no
          further description. It was found February 27th, 1871, with 1 tooth of Hyaena
          and fragments of bone, in the fourth " foot-level," but had no Stalagmitic

            Floor over it.

            In this connexion may be mentioned a piece of calcareous spar, which
ON Kent's cavern, Devonshire.                        11

appears to have been used as a polishing-stone. It was found March Bth,
1871, with 2 teeth of Hyaena, 2 of Horse, 3 of Rhinoceros, gnawed bones,
and a flint flake, in the fourth " foot-level," having over it a Stalagmitic Floor
18 inches thick. No such specimen had been noticed before.

  A piece of burnt bone was found on the 22nd of the same month, with

fragments of bone and faecal matter, in the second " foot-level," having a

Stalagmitic Floor over it.

   Mr. M'Enery appears to have excavated beyond the limits of his shaft, not
only in an easterly direction, as has been already stated, but also, at least,
north and south of it. So far as can be determined, the shaft was first sunk,

and the material taken out lodged between it and the western wall of the

Chamber, after which he undertook what may be called the adjacent hori-

zontal diggings, and fiUed up the shaft with a portion of the excavated matter,

thereby rendering it impossible to determine the exact site of the shaft itself.

He does not appear to have taken outside the Cavern any portion of the deposit

in order to ensure its more complete examination ; hence it is not probable
that all its contents were detected. Indeed, when speaking of his researches
in this Chamber, he says, " It was feared that in the ardour of the first search,
facts of importance might have been overlooked. The mass of mould thrown
up on the former occasion was therefore a second time turned over and care-
fully searched, but nothing new was brought to light "*.

    This mass the Superintendents decided on taking out of the Cavern,
partly to facilitate the excavation of deposits certainly intact beyond, and
also because it was thought likely to be lodged on unbroken ground. Though
there seemed but httle prospect of finding any thing by subjecting it to a
third search, such a search was nevertheless made, and did not go unre-
warded. The heap, though mainly of Cave-earth, included fragments of the
granular Stalagmitic Floor and portions of the Black Mould, and yielded

hundreds of bones and portions of bones (one having an artificial hole lined
with stalagmitic matter), fragments of antlers, the largest fragment of an Ele-
phant's tusk that the Committee have met with, 143 teeth of Hysena, 153 of
Horse, 45 of Rhinoceros, 27 of Deer, including " Irish Elk " and Reindeer, 6

of Bear, 5 of Ox, 5 of Sheep, 3 of Elephant, 3 of Wolf, 3 of Dog (?), 2 of Fox,

2 of Pig, and 1 of Lion, a few marine sheUs, several fragments of black pot-

--tery, 4 pieces of stalagmite with fern-impressions, and 13 flint implements

and flakes, aU, with one exception, of the prevalent white colour, and two
of them decidedly good specimens of the strongly ridged lanceolate forms.
In short, the virgin soil, in some parts of the Cavern, has been less pro-
ductive than was this mass which had been twice carefully searched, but by

candle-light only.

    As was thought probable, the mass of dislodged materials proved to be
lying on ground which had never been broken. Between Mr. M'Enery's
shaft and the west wall of the Chamber there was a space of at least 17
feet ; and at 14 feet from the wall the Cave-earth was found to have not

only the ordinary granular Stalagmitic Floor overlying it, but to be de-
posited on another and necessarily an older Floor of the same material, but

--which, instead of being granular, was made up of prismatic crystals posses-

sing, in short, the characters both of position and structure of the Old Crys-
talline Floor found in the " Lecture Hall" and " South-west Chamber," and

--described in the Fourth Report (Norwich, 1868), a remnant, in situ, of the

Floor which had furnished the large blocks of stalagmite found in the Cave-

13 REPORT 1871.

earth in the Sloping Chamber, as already stated. From the point where it was        I
first seen, it was everywhere continuous up to the western wall. Its thickness

has not been ascertained ; for though it was partially broken up in cutting

the four-feet section, the bottom of it was not reached. No objects of any
kind were found in it. Had Mr. M'Euery's excavations been carried but a

yard further west he must have encountered it, and would have been enabled
to solve the problem of the blocks which he so often found in the Cave-

 earth.

    The Committee are most anxious to guard against the impression that, in
any of the foregoing remarks, they have been unmindful of the service which
Mr. M'Enery rendered to science, or have the most remote wish to depre-
ciate the value of his long-continued labours. Indeed, when they remember
that the means at his disposal must have been very limited, and that he was
amongst the pioneers in cavern searching, they cannot but feel that the
extent and results of his investigations are richly entitled to the warmest

praise.

    They venture, however, to take this opportunity of stating that, in order
to a thorough and satisfactory investigation, cavern-deposits should be ex-
cavated, not by sinking occasional shafts, but continuously in a horizontal direc-
tion, to a uniform depth not exceeding 5 or at most 6 feet at first ; that
the material should be carefully examined in situ, and then taken to day-
light for re-examination. Through not following the first, Mr. M'Enery
failed to understand the exact historical order of the Cavern-deposits ; and
through not being able to accomplish the second, he passed over many speci-
mens calculated to have modified his conclusions, and which he would have
been delighted to have found. For example, when speaking of the Sloping

Chamber, he says, " The [Stalagmitic] crust is thickest in the middle ....

for opening the excavation, the same means were employed as to break up
a mass of ancient masonry. Flint blades were detected in it at all depths,
even so low as to come in contact with the fossil bones and their earthy
matrix, but never below them" *. During the last six months, however, the ex-
cavations made in the same Chamber, and in the immediate neighbourhood of
his, have brought forth Flint implements from every level of the Cave-earth
to which the work has been carried, and they were actually found in

greatest numbers in the lowest levels. To this may be added the fact that

in his heap of refuse-matter, which he had twice examined, there were, as
has been already said, upwards of a dozen flint blades, such as he stated

never occurred in the Cave-earth. Had the soil been examined in daylight,

they could not have been overlooked ; for, instead of being specimens of
little value, they are better far than some of those which he figured ; and it

is but right to add that many of those found by the Committee were thus

detected.

   Again, Mr. M'Enery was keenly watchful for extraneous objects in the
Stalagmitic Floor ; and, from his silence on the question, it may be safely
concluded that he never saw fern-impressions in it ; nevertheless his refuse-
heap contained four small slabs of the floor, in each of which was a
weU-marked impression, requiring not additional manipulation, but simple
daylight for their detection. Indeed every specimen of this kind has been

recognized outside the Cavern only.
   The four slabs just mentioned, as well as the two found by the Committee

in the Floor they broke up, have been submitted to Mr. "W. Carruthers,

F.R.S., of the British Museum, who has kindly furnished the following note

respecting them :

                         "British Museum, 10 July, 1871,

" The ferns are specimens of Pteris aquilina, Linn., and have belonged to

very luxuriant plants ; they do not diifer from those now growing in Eng-

land. It is possible that the fragment -^^-f may be another species, but it
is too imperfect to determine, and it may only be a barren portion of the

Pteris, with shorter and broader pinnules than the other specimens.

                   (Signed)  " Wm. Cabbxjtheks."

    Returning for a moment to the Old Crystalline Stalagmitic Floor beneath
 the Cave-earth, it was observed that, like the modern and granular one, it

 had here and there on its upper surface conical bosses rising above its gene-
 ral level, and that there were corresponding protuberances vertically above
 them on the upper floor. The same fact had been noticed in the other

--branches of the Cavern where the two Floors occurred in the same vertical

 sections, a fact apparently warranting the conclusion that the drainage
 through the Cavern-roof underwent no important change during the entire
 period represented by the two floors and the intervening Cave-earth.

 When to this it is added that such bosses are, at least in most cases, verti-
 cally beneath Stalactitic pendants on the ceiling, it may be further inferred

 that the ancient and modern lines of drainage are, in the main, identical.

    On the completion of the work in the Sloping Chamber, on July 11,

 1871, the excavation of the "Wolf's Den," which opens out of its northern

 side, was begun. It was in this Den that Mr. M'Enery found the canines
 of Machairodus latidens, which have excited so much attention. No such
 specimens have been met with during the present investigation up to this

 time.

    The Committee, believing it possible that the subject might prove to be
 connected with their researches, have from time to time mentioned the

-occasional occurrence of living animals in the Cavern*. Indeed, Kent's

Hole is not better known to the palaeontologist as a store-house of mamma-

 lian remains, than to the Devonshire naturalist as a home of the Great
 Horseshoe Bat {Ehinolophus ferrum-equinum, Leach) ; and every visitor, be-
fore the present exploration, must have frequently seen them hanging from
the walls of the more retired branches. The following facts have presented
 themselves during the last twelve months :

     Whilst the excavation of one of the lateral branches of Smerdon's Passage

was in progress, a considerable number of fresh spindle-shaped faeces, about
 ·6 inch long and -2 inch thick, were observed lying on the surface of the
Cave-earth, whUe between it and the roof there was an interspace just
 sufficient to allow an animal about the size of a Badger to pass.

    The workmen having observed that the candles were much nibbled during
their absence, that the greasy wooden candlesticks were sometimes carried off

and some of them, after a few days, found secreted in small holes, set a suit-
ably baited gin for the suspected offender. Their efforts were rewarded the
next morning by finding a rat dead in the trap.

    Old newspapers &c. are occasionally sent to the Cavern for the purpose of
wrapping up small boxes of specimens, or such delicate objects as need more

than ordinary care. On November 28th, 1871, the workmen, using in this way

a part of a copy of the ' Saturday Review,' unintentionally left one complete
.and sound sheet, i. e. two leaves, near the spot where they had been at work.

* See Eeports Brit. Assoc. 1869, p. 204, and 1870, p. 27.
14 REPORT 1871,

The next morning they found the paper precisely where they had left it,
but with about one-fifth of one of the leaves gone, and the broken margin
of the remainder apparently nibbled. There was nothing to prevent the
whole from being taken off, and it was noted that, though left in a preca-
rious position, it had not fallen down. The broken leaf was then torn oif
and preserved, whilst the unbroken one was allowed to remain as a further
experiment. The next morning no trace of it was to be seen. That even-
ing a rat-trap was set at the spot, and very near it another leaf of paper was
placed, having on it a small stone, which it was supposed a rat, but not
a smaller animal, might be capable of moving. The next morning the
paper was found where it had been put, but very much nibbled, whilst the
trap and the grease with which it was baited appeared to have not been
touched. Before leaving work, the men baited the trap with a tempting end
of candle, and placed it on a leaf of paper ; whilst another leaf, weighted

with a lump of earth, was placed near. On the following morning both

pieces of paper were found to be considerably eaten or torn ; and it was
noted that the injury done to the former was within the margin of the trap
placed on it, whilst the trap itself, as well as its bait, remained unaffected,
further than that there were on it a few spindle-shaped fteces about a quar-
ter of an inch long. There can be no doubt that some animal, probably
smaller than a rat, carried off the missing leaf to a recess in the Cavern,

where it may serve to make its nest comfortable, and perhaps hereafter to
puzzle a cavern searcher who may discover it.

Fourth Report of the Committee for the purpose of investigating the
   rate of Increase of Underground Temperature downwards in vari-

   ous Localities of Dry Land and under Water. Drawn up by Prof.

In last year's Report, the intention was expressed of boring down at the
bottom of Rosebridge Colliery, if the Association would provide the necessary
funds. The circumstances were exceptionally inviting, and the Association
very liberally granted the sum asked. The Secretary thereupon paid two

visits to Eosebridge, descended and to some extent explored the coUiery, in
company with Mr. Bryham, and, after a careful study of the plans and sec-
tions, agreed upon a particular spot where the bore was to be sunk. Tra-

cings of the plans and sections were kindly sent by Mr. Bryham, who in
every way cooperated most cordially, and gave much valuable assistance in

arranging the scheme of operations. Several weeks elapsed, which were
occupied in making and testing a very large spirit thermometer, suitable for
reading in the bad light of a mine, and capable of being read, by estimation.

to the hundredth of a degree, from 90° to 110° F. ; and on the 7th
November the Secretary wrote to Mr. Bryham requesting him to commence
operations. Unfortunately, during this brief interval, circumstances had
changed. In a neighbouring pit, where the workings were in the same seam of
coal as at Eosebridge, though less deep by 200 yards, a considerable quantity
of water was found in sinking into the strata underlying this seam. This
was a very unexpected circumstance ; and as any irruption of water at the

bottom of Eosebridge pit, which is now quite dry, would be a most serious
affair, Mr, Bryham was afraid to risk the experiment of boring do^vn. Sub-
sequent reflection has only confirmed him in the opinion that such a step
would bo hazardous, and the Committee have accordingly been most reluc-

tantly compelled to renounce the plan. Mr. Bryham's final refusal was
received on the 28th February.

    Professor Ansted read a paper last year, in the Geological Section of the
Association, upon the Alpine tunnel, commonly called the Mont-Cenis tuii-

nel, and in that paper some interesting statements were made regarding its

temperature. Since that time, Professor Ansted has interchanged very
numerous letters with the Secretary, and has furnished mxxch valuable in-
formation, gathered from Prof. Sismonda, of Turin, and from M. Borelli, the
resident engineer of the tunnel. Observations which appear to be reliable
have been made in bore-holes in the sides of the tunnel, and the tempera-

tures thus observed have been compared with the estimated mean tempera-
ture at the surface overhead, which in the highest part is a mile above the tun-
nel, or 2905 metres above sea-level. It is directly under this highest part that
the highest temperature is foimd in the walls of the tunnel, namely 29°-5 C,
or 85°"1 F., which is 9° F. lower than the temperature found at the bottom
of the Eosebridge shaft at the depth of only 815 yards. But though the
tunnel is at more than double this depth fi'om the crest of the mountain
over it, we must bear in mind that the surface-temperatures are very dif-
ferent. In a paper pubKshed by the engineer of the tunnel, M. F. Giordano,
the mean temperature of the air at the crest of the mountain (Mont Frejus)

--is calculated to be 2°-6 C, or 27°'3 F. Assuming this estimate to be

correct, we have a difference of 57°-8 F. between the deepest part of the tun-
nel and the air at the surface vertically over it ; assuming further, as we did

 in the case of Eosebridge in last year's Eeport, that the surface of the hill itself

has a mean temperature 1° F. lower than that of the air above it, we have a

 difference of 56°-8 F., and the thickness of rock between is 1610 metres, or
 5280 feet (exactly a mile). This gives, by simple division, a rate of increase of
 1° F. for 93 feet ; but a very large correction must be applied for the con-

 vexity of the ground ; for it is evident that a point in the ground vertically
 under a steep crest is more exposed to the cooling influence of the air than

 a point at the same depth beneath an extensive level surface. No correction

 for convexity would be needed if the temperature of the air decreased up-

 wards as fast as the temperature of the internal rock ; but this is very far
 from being the case, the decrease being about 3| times more rapid in the
 rock than in the air. To form an approximate notion of the amount of this

 correction, we must determine, as well as we can, the forms of the succes-
 sive isothermal surfaces in the interior of the mountain. The tendency is
 for all corners and bends to be eased off as we descend, so that each suc-

 ceeding isothermal surface is flatter than the one above it. Accordingly, if

 we have a mountain rising out of a plain, without any change of material, the
 isothermals will be further apart in a vertical through the crest of the moun-

.tain than under the plain on either side ; they will also be further apart
--16 REPORT 1871.

at the highest part of this vertical, that is close under the crest, than at a
lower level in the same vertical. It would be absurd to pretend to fix the
amount of the correction with accuracy ; but it seems not unreasonable to
estimate that, in the present case, the numer of isothermals cut through by a
vertical line descending from the crest of the ridge to the tunnel itself is
about seven-eighths of the number which wovdd be cut through in sinking
through an equal distance in level ground, other circumstances being the same.

Instead of 1° in 93 feet, we should thus have 1° in ^ of 93, that is, in 81 feet.

    This is a slow rate of increase, and is about the same as Mr. Fairbaim
found at Dukenfield. The rocks penetrated by the tunnel consist of highly
metamorphosed material, and are described as belonging to the Jurassic

series. No fossils have been found in them. For two-thirds of the length

of the tunnel, beginning from the Italian end, they are remarkably uniform,
and it is in this part that the observations have been taken. The following

--account of them has been given by Prof. Ansted (Pop. Sci. Review, Oct.

1870, p. 351) : " The rocks on which the observations have been made are
absolutely the same, geologically and otherwise, from the eatrance to the
tunnel, on the Italian side, for a distance of nearly 10,000 j'^ards. They
are not faidted to any extent, though highly inclined, contorted, and sub-
jected to slight slips and slides. They contain little water and no mineral
veins. They consist, to a very large extent indeed, of silica, either as
quartz or in the form of silicates, chiefly of alumina, and the small quantity

of lime they contain is a crystalline carbonate."
    This uniformity of material is very favourable to conduction, and the high

inclination of the strata (in which respect these rocks resemble those at
Dukenfield) also appears to promote either conduction proper or aqueous con-
vection, which resembles conduction in its effects. As regards Mons. Gior-
dano's estimate of the mean air- temperature at the crest, it is obtained in

--the following way : The hill of San Theodule is 430 metres higher, and

the city of Turin is 2650 metres lower than the crest ; the temperature of

--the former has been determined by one year's observations to be 5°'l C,

and that of the latter is 12°-5 C. If a decrease of 1° C. for every 174 metres
of elevation be assumed (1° F. for 317 feet), we obtain, either bj' com-

--parison with San Theodule or with Turin, the same determination 2°-6

for the air-temperature at the crest of the ridge over the tunnel.

   This mode of estimating the temperature appears very fair, though of
course subject to much uncertainty ; and there is another element of uncer-
tainty in the diff'erence which may exist between the air-temperature and

the rock-temperature at the summit.
   These two elements of uncertainty would be eliminated if a boring of

from 50 to 100 feet were sunk at the summit, and observations of tempera-
ture taken in it. The uncertain correction for convexity would still remain
to be applied. It would therefore be desirable also to sink a boring, of about
the same depth, in the plateau which extends for about a quarter of the
length of the tunnel, beginning near the Italian end, its height above the
tunnel being about a third of a mile.

   In November last, when very little information had reached this country

respecting the temperature-observations in the tunnel, an urgent appeal was
addressed, jointly by your Committee and by the Geographical Society (of
which Prof. Ansted is Foreign Secretary), to M. Sismonda, requesting him
to use his influence with the Italian authorities to -secure a series of accu-
rate observations of the temperature in the sides of the tunnel, before time had
been allowed for this temperature to undergo sensible change from its original
                ON UNDERGROUND TEMPERATURE.  17

value. It was also suggested that the mean temperature of the surface
overhead should be examined by boring.

    M. Sismonda speedily replied, stating that he fully recognized the impor-
tance of such experiments, and had already made arrangements with the
Government at Turin, and with the contractors for the railway works, to
have them carried out as fully and fairly as possible. Had the communica-
tion reached him at a time of year when he could have travelled without
great inconvenience, he would have gone to the spot himself; but as that
was now impossible, the Government Commissioner for the works, M. Salva-
tori, had undertaken to see the experiments carried through by employes
under his orders. M. Sismonda further stated that, from the commence-
ment of the tunnel, the Academy of Sciences of Turin had instituted a series

of scientific observations in it, in which observations of temperature were
included. The results of these observations he promised to forward as soon
as they were completed and tabulated.

   On the receipt of the final refusal to bore down at the bottom of Eosc-

bridge Colliery, inquiries were instituted as to the feasibility of executing a

similar operation in the deepest part of the Alpine tunnel. The contractors
have, however, declined to grant permission, as the operation would involve

additional encumbrance of the very narrow space in which their works are
proceeding. It appears that a length of a mile or more in the deepest part

of the tunnel has not yet been opened out to the full width, so that oppor-

tunity niay yet be given to excavate a lateral heading and bore down, if the
Association encourage the plan.

   Mr, G. J. Symons has repeated his observations in the Kentish Town

weD, at every fiftieth foot of depth, from 350 to 1100 feet, which is the
lowest point attainable. As the water begins at the depth of 210 feet, all

these observations may be regarded as unaff'ected by the influence of the

external air, and they have now been sufficiently numerous at each depth
to render further verification needless. The following are the results finally

adopted, and they do not diifer materially from those first published (Report

for 18693.

occurs at about the depth of 600 feet. This must be due to springs. The
soil, from the depth of 569 to that of 702 feet, is described as " light-grey
chalk, with a few thin beds of chalk-marl subordinate." The soil consists
in general of chalk and marl, from 325 to 910 feet, and below this of sandy
marl, sand, and clay (see list of strata in last year's Report, p. 41). The
mean rate of increase in the former is a degree in 56 feet, and in the latter
a degree in 49 feet. The mean rate of increase from the surface of the
ground to the lowest depth reached is certainly very nearly 1° F. in 54 feet.

   Mr. David Burns, of H.M. Geological Survey, has furnished observations

taken in the W. B. lead-mines, at and near AUenheads, Northumberland, by

the kind permission of Thomas Sopwith, Esq., F.ll.S., and with the valuable
assistance of Mr. Ridley, Underground Surveyor, who continued the obser-
vations after Mr. Burns had Isft.

   The mineral for which these mines are worked is galena. There are very
extensive old workings at a lower level than the present workings, and filled
with water, which is kept down by pumping ; but the quantity daily pumped
out is very small in comparison with the whole, so that the change of water

is slow.

   From the offices of the lead-mines a small windlass with a supply of fine
brass wire was obtained, which enabled the thermometer to be lowered

steadily and quickly.
   The first observations were taken in Gin-Hill shaft, 3rd June, 1871. The

observers proceeded as far down in the works as they were able, and took
their station in a level leading from the shaft, 290 feet from the surface of
the ground, and 38 feet above the surface of the water in the shaft.

   The following observations were then made :

   The mean temperature at the shaft mouth for the year ending 31 st May
1871, was 44°-3, as derived from daily obsei'vations of maximum and mini-

mum thermometers, without applying a correction for diiirnal range. Add-

ing 1° to this, to obtain the probable mean temperature of the surface of

the ground, and taking the temperature at 400 feet of depth as 51''-3, Mr.
Burns computes that the rate of increase downwards is 6° in 400 feet, or 1°

in 66'6 feet. The data for this calculation are obviously in many respects

very uncertain.

   On the 21st June Mr. Ridley took observations in another shaft in the
same workings, called the High Underground Engine Shaft. It is sunk

from a level at the depth of 398 feet below ground, and the surface of the
water in it is 399 feet down the shaft, or 797 feet below the surface of the
ground. There are pumps in the shaft, but they had been stationary for more
than 24 hours before the observations were made. Immediately after the

observations they were started, and when they had been working for some
time the temperature of the water lifted was found to be 65°-2. They draw
their water at a depth of 957 feet below the surface of the ground.

   The following were the observations :

    The thermometer could not be lowered beyond 857 feet without risk of

losing it, by getting fast in the wooden framework with which the pumps
were secured. Mr. Burns thinks that some of the temperatures here re-
corded are too low, from the index being shaken down by reason of the im-
pediments presented by the upper portions of the framework. The surface
of the ground over this shaft is about 300 feet higher than over Gin-Hill
shaft. If we allow 1° for this increase of height, and call the temperature of

the surface of the ground 44°-3, as against 45°-3 at Gin Hill, we have, by

comparison with the observed temperature 65°-7 at the depth of 857 feet,
an increase of 21°-4 in 857 feet, or 1° in 40 feet.

   On the 6th July Mr. Eidley took observations in another sump or under-

ground shaft at Slitt mine, Weardale. This shaft is sunk from the lowest

level in the working, and had been standing full of water during the five
months which had elapsed since it was sunk. The only source of disturbance
was a little water running along the level across the top of the shaft, so as

to enter the shaft (so to speak) on one side and leave it on the other. This

may affect the temperature at 3 feet, but could scarcely affect the tempera-
ture at 53 feet, which may be regarded as veiy reliable.

   The following are the observations ;

    Mr. Burns says " the surface-temperature at Slitt mine will be nearly the

same as that at Gin-Hill shaft, judging from their relative elevations,

aspects, and [exposure to the winds." Assuming it then to be 45°-3, and

reckoning the temperature at 660 feet as 65°, we have an increase down-

wards of 19°-7 in 660 feet, or 1° in 33-5 feet. The only datum that seems

doubtful here is the surface-temperature. If, instead of 45°'3, it be assumed

near the river Allen, about 1^ mile from Gin-HiU shaft, and at an elevation

was sunk some years ago, and has since stood nearly fuU of water. At the
time of the observations the surface of the water was 24 feet down the

shaft. The following are the observations taken in this shaft on June

   These observations were taken early in the morning, when the air and
springs were so cold as to allow the maximum thermometer to be cooled below
the temperature of the shaft. In order to test more thoroughly the apparent
uniformity of temperature from 100 feet down to 350 feet, Mr. Ridley took
a second series of observations, extending from the 22nd to the 27th June.
In these observations the thermometer was lowered in a tin case fiUed with
water colder than that of the shaft. The thermometer was supported within
the case in a vertical position by a wooden frame, and prevented from shak-
ing about. It was allowed to remain at each depth several hours, was then
lifted, and read with all possible care. The following are the observations

thus obtained :

depth was due to the difference of temperature of the surface-water which
soaked in through the limestone in the two cases. As regards the tempera-
tures at depths exceeding 200 feet, it would appear that, in times of compa-

rative drought (as in the first set), the heat of the soil at the greater depths
has time to produce a little augmentation in the temperature of the water

before it soaks away.

   This shaft is obviously not adapted for giving any information as to the
rate of increase downwards. Collecting the best determinations from the

other shafts we have :

    Mr. Burns considers that little or no weight should be attached to the first
of these determinations, as a pumping-engine was working in a neighbouring

shaft communicating with it at the time when the observations were taken.
The jump of 2° in descending from 340 to 390 feet also renders the inter-

pretation of these observations difficult.

   The closeness of the temperatures in the other two shafts, at depths differ-
ing by about 200 feet, suggests the idea that they are both fed by the same
spring, and that the temperatures indicated are the temperature of the origin
of the spring slightly modified by the different temperatures of the strata
through which it has passed ; but their positions appear to render this im-

possible.

   Mr. Burns's opinion from all the observations is that the mean rate of in-
crease downwards at Allenheads is about 1° in 35 feet ; but this cannot at

present be held as proved.

   The strata consist mainly of alternate beds of sandstone and shale, with a
few beds of limestone intermixed. In Slitt mine there is also a bed of
basalt 158 feet thick, overlying the vein of fluor-spar in which the workings
are carried on, the workings being 55 feet down in this vein.

   Preparations are being made for taking observations in the dry part of the
mines, by making shallow bores at different levels, inserting the thermometer,
plugging up the hole for a few days, and then reading.

   Another gentleman connected with H.M. Geological Survey, Mr. R. L.

lack, has taken observations in a bore at Crawriggs, Kirkintilloch, near

Cilasgow. They were taken on the 29th November 1870, the temperature
of the air being 34°. The surface of the water in the bore was 6 feet below
the surface of the ground, the latter being 200 feet above sea-level. The

The Secretary has corresponded with the Smithsonian Institution respect-

ing the great bore at St. Louis, which was described in last year's Report,

and also respecting the Hoosac Tunnel which passes under a mountain and

will be 4| miles long, but the correspondence has not yet led to any definite

result.

It was stated in last Report that application had been made to General

Helmersen, of the Mining College, St. Petersburg, for information regarding

the temperature of a very deep bore in course of sinking at Moscow, as well

Aas regarding underground temperatures in Russia generally.                                         long delay

occurred, owing to the General being absent from home for seven months,

and  not  receiving  the  communication  till  his  return                                     but  shortly after his
                                                                                            ;

-- Wereturn he dispatched a very polite answer, from which the following passages
are extracted: "          have an artesian well in St. Petersburg, bored in the

Lower Silurian strata. At the depth of 656 English feet this well stops at the

granite, a granite which perfectly resembles that of Finland. The lowest

portion of these Silurian strata is merely a degraded granite, a grit combined

with debris of felspar. About 353,000 hectolitres of water flow from the

well per diem, and this water issues with a constant temperature of 9°-8

Reaumur                   You are doubtless aware of the existence of a series

of observations on the temperature of the soil at the bottom of a well which

was sunk in the town of Yakoutsk in Eastern Siberia. This well has shown

us that the soil of Siberia, at least in this part of its great extent, is frozen

--to a depth of 540 English feet. The mean temperature of Yakoutsk is
   8°-2 R. At the depth of 100 feet the temperature of the soil was found to

--be 5°-2. Prom this depth to the bottom the temperature increased at the

rate of 1° R. for every 117 feet; whence it would follow that the soil at
Yakoutsk is frozen to the depth of about 700 feet.

   " It appears to me a very interesting circumstance that, according to ac-

counts just received by the Icademy of Sciences from Baron Maydel, traveller

in the country of the Tchukchees [des Tschouktschi], there are found in

those regions layers of ice, quite pure, alternating with sand and clay. The

interesting letter of the Baron will shortly be printed in the publications of

the Academy. It was in making excavations in search of mammoths that
Maydel made this discovery."

   If we assume the temperature of the surface of the soil at St. Petersburg
to be 39°- 17 F., which, according to ' Herschel's Meteorology,' is the mean

temperature of the air at the Magnetic and Meteorological Observatory, and

if we take the temperature of the water as that of the bottom of the well,
we have an increase downwards of 14°-88 F. in 656 feet, which is at the rate
of 1° F. in 44-1 feet. If, on the other hand, we suppose the surface of the
ground to be 4° F. warmer than the air (and the difference at Yakoutsk ap-

pears to be greater than this), we deduce an increase at the rate of 1° F. in

60 feet.

The rate of increase at Yakoutsk from the depth of 100 feet to the bottom

of the frozen well at 540 feet is given above by General Helmersen as 1° R,

in 117 feet. This is 1° F. in 52 feet.

   An account of the Yakoutsk well is given in ' Comptes Rendus,' tome vi.

1838, p. 501, in an extract from a letter by Erman (fils), who visited Ya-
koutsk when the well had attained a depth of 50 feet. He gives the tem-

perature at this depth from his own observations, and the temperatures at

77, 119, and 382 feet from the subsequent observations of the merchant to

whom the well belonged. His figures differ very materially from those given

above ; but it may fairly be presumed that General Helmersen's account is

the more accurate.

Before the receipt of General Helmersen's letter, <;he following communi-

cation respecting the Moscow boring had been received by the Secretary from

Mons. N. Lubimoff, Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University of

Moscow.

        -- " December ^^, 1870.

" Dear Sir, I beg your pardon for not having replied sooner to your letter.

I am sorry to say that the information which I can now communicate is very

deficient. The great bore of Moscow is not yet terminated, and the experi-

ments on temperature which have been made hitherto are but of a preli-

minary kind. It was in the hope of renewing the measurements under more

satisfactory conditions that I delayed my answer ; but as certain circum-

stances did not permit me to resume the observations, which are therefore

deferred to the spring of 1871, 1 must restrict myself to describing the old ones.

   " These were made, on my commission, by M. Schiller, B.A., in April 1809.

The bore was then about 994 feet deep, and, from 56 feet to the bottom,

Afull of water.  mercury thermometer of a peculiar kind was constructed,

myon an idea of  own. It consisted of a capillary tube of thick glass, ter-

minating below in a large reservoir ; at the upper end a funnel-like piece

was adjusted, into which the mercury flowed off as soon as the temperature

rose above a certain value [sketch annexed]. The whole was placed within

a closed case, which was plunged to a chosen depth into the bore, and re-

versed by means of a special arrangement. It was then brought again to the

right position and drawn up to the surface, a poftion of mercury having

flowed away. Here the thermometer was plunged into a water-bath, the

temperature of which was so regulated that the mercury attained the end of

the capillary tube ; this was then the temperature required.
   " The measurements were made at the depths of 175, 350, 525, 700, 875,

and 994 feet. From 350 feet to the bottom the temperature throughout the

bore was found to be nearly constant, namely 10°'l C, with deviations of

+ 0°-l. The temperatures of the upper parts of the bore were not quite

precisely ascertained, the chief attention being given, in these first experi-

ments, to the deeper parts. The air-temperature at the surface for the time

 ?^4^^11 April to

(29 ^
         5 May / varied between -f-7°-5 and -l°-9 C.
" As soon as the boring is completed, and the present impediments removed

from the bore, the observations will be resumed, and perhaps some new

methods will be applied for the sake of verification, though the above de-

scribed apparatus, previously tried, seemed to give very exact results.

" I shall be very glad to communicate to you, as soon as possible, the re-

sults of the new experiments. As to underground temperatures for Russia

in general, there is, so far as I know, no place where regular and trustworthy

observations have been made {^should be made in original] except the Central

Physical Observatory at St. Petersburg, the results of which are published by

Dr. Wild, Director of the establishment, in his printed Annual Reports."

From the sketch annexed to the description in Professor Lubimoff's letter,

it appears that the enlargement at the open end of the capillary tube is quite

sudden, and not likely to retain any mercury when inverted. The idea of

error from this cause may therefore be dismissed ; but the instrument is en-
24 REPORT 1871.

tirely unprotected against the pressure of the water in which it is immersed,
and it is important to consider what effect this pressure will have.

    In thermometers of the ordinary construction this pi'essure acts only ex-

ternally, and produces much greater diminiition of the internal volume than

when, as in Prof. Lubimoff's thermometer, it acts both externally and in-

ternally, a mode of action with which we are familiar in the case of CErsted's

piezometer.

   From Eegnault's experiments it appears that the apparent compression of
mercury in glass, when the pressure is thus applied, is -000001234 per atmo-

sphere, whereas the apparent expansion of mercury in glass for heat is -0000857
per degree Fahi-enheit. The latter number is 69 times the former ; it there-
fore appears that a pressure of 69 atmospheres would be required to falsify
the indications of Prof. Lubimoff's thermometer to the extent of 1° F. The
actual pressure at the bottom of the well is less than the half of this, and
therefore should only produce an error of a few tenths of a degree. This,
however, is on the assumption that the glass undergoes no change of figure, a

condition which may easily fail of being fulfilled, owing to the want of perfect

uniformity in the glass.
    Mr. Donaldson has written from Calcutta to the effect that the thermo-

meter which was sent to him has been entrusted to a competent observer,
who has taken numerous observations with it, which will be sent shortly.

    M. Erman's letter above referred to is immediately followed in the ' Comptes
Rendus' by an account, by M. Walferdin, of some observations, which appear
to be very reliable, taken in artesian weUs in the basin in which Paris is

situated. They were taken with maximum thermometers of the kind in-

vented by Walferdin himself, in which the mercur3' overflows into a reservoir

when the temperature exceeds a certain limit, the thermometers being her-

metically sealed in glas^ tubes to protect them from pressure.
   The observations which he first describes were taken in a well, newly

sunk to the depth of 263 metres, at St. Andre, about 50 miles to the west of
Paris, and which failed to yield a supply of water. The temperature was
carefully observed at the depth of 253 metres by means of two thermometers,
which were allowed to remain at that depth for ten hours. Their indications
agreed to -03 of a degree Centigrade, and gave a mean of 17°-95 C. For the
sake of comparison, M. Walferdin observed the temperature at the bottom of
a well 75 metres deep, situated at a distance of only 13 metres from the other
well, and found it 12°-2C., showing a difference of 5°-75C. in 178 metres, which

is at the rate of 1° C. in 30-95 metres, or 1° F. in 56-4 feet. He mentions that

he also employed two Six's thermometers (deux thermometrographes) enclosed
in copper tubes to protect them from pressure, but both of these gave erroneous
indications. The copper case of one was imperfect, and allowed a little water
to enter. This one read l°-25 too high, owing probably to the effect of
pressure ; the other read 2°-15 too low, owing probably to the index being
shaken down.

   The temperature at the depth of 400 metres in the puits de Grenelle at
Paris was observed on two difierent occasions. The indications were 23°-5
on the first and 23°-75 on the second occasion; and these M. Walferdin com-
pares with the constant temperature ll°-7 in the caves of the Observatory at

the depth of 28 metres. Taking the mean of the two observations, 23°-6, we

have a difference of ll°-9 in 372 metres, which is at the rate of 1° C. in 31-2
metres, or 1° F. in 56-9 feet.

   Observations in the well of the Military School, at a distance of 600 metres
from the puits de Grenelle, showed a temperature of 16°-4 C. at the depth of
                                                                           --

173 metres. This gives, by comparison with the Observatory caves, au in-

crease at the rate of 1° C. in 30-85 metres, or 1° F. in 56-25 feet.

These three determinations are in wonderfully close agreement with each

other. All three wells are sunk in the chalk of the Paris basin. In the

case of the St. Andre well the thicknesses of the different strata were :

              metres.

   The thermometer which the Committee have been employing for the last
three years is a Phillips's maximum, having so fine a bore that the detached
column of mercury which serves as the index is sustained in the vertical
position by capillary action, and will bear a moderate amount of shaking
without slipping down. Numerous instances, however, have occurred in
which the index has slipped in consequence of jerks or concussions sustained
by the thermometer in hauling it up from a depth. During the past six
months the Secretary has been in correspondence with Messrs. Negretti and

Zambra respecting a proposed modification of the maximum thermometer
known by their name, which occurred to him more than a year ago, and was

described by him privately to some meteorological friends at the last Meeting
of the Association. It was then supposd to be new, but it now appears that
Messrs. Negretti and Zambra have made something of the kind for the last
fourteen or fifteen years. Several changes, however, were necessary before
the thermometer was adapted to the uses of the Committee, and the first
complete instruments were received in June last. They are enclosed, like the

thermometers previously used, in hermetically sealed tubes, for protection
against pressure, and they have the advantages (1) of being able to bear
more severe jolts without derangement of their indications, and (2) of pre-

senting to view a much broader column of mercury, so as to be more easily
read in a dim light.

   The instrument is to be used in a vertical position, with the bulb uppermost.
Between the bulb and the stem there is a contraction, through which the
mercury will not pass except under pressure. It is set by holding it with
the bulb end lowest, and tapping this end on the palm of the hand, tiU the
part between the contraction and the bulb is fuU of mercury. It can then
be held with the bulb up, and the mercury in the stem wiU run down to the
lower end, from which the graduations begin. In this position, the top of
the column indicates the temperature of setting, which must be lower than

the temperature intended to be observed.

    The instrument is then to be lowered into the bore to any required depth,
and allowed to remain there for about half an hour, to ensure its taking the
temperature of the surrounding water. The expansion of the mercury in
the bulb with heat will force a portion of the liquid through the contraction,
and subsequent cooling in hauling up will not cause any of it to return.
The portion which has thus escaped from the bulb into the stem will usually
be found rem^iining close to the contraction, when the thermometer has been
hauled up. The instrument must then be gently inclined, so as to make the
bulb end slightly the lowest, when the mercury in the stem wiU all unite
into one column, which will run down to its place on again raising the bulb.
The head of the column will then indicate the required temperature.
26 REPORT--1871.

Report on Observations of Luminous Meteors, 1870-71. By a Com-

   mittee consisting of James Glaisher, F.R.S., of the Royal
   Observatory, Greenwich, Robert P. Greg, F.R.S., Alexander
   S. Herschel, F.R.A.S., and Charles Brooke, F.R.S., Secre-

    tary to the Meteorological Society.

The object of the Committee being, as in the previous year, to present a

condensed Report of the observations which they have received, and to indi-

cate the progress of Meteoric Astronomy during the interval vrhich has

elapsed since their last Eeport, the reviews of recent publications relating to
ileteoric Science which will be found in the sequel are preceded by a state-

ment of the results obtained by the observers, who have during the past

year contributed a valuable list of communications on the appearances of

luminous meteors and regular observations of star-showers to the Com-

mittee. The real heights and velocities of thirteen shooting-stars obtained

by the cooperation of Mr. Glaisher's staff of observers at the Royal Obser-

vatory, Greenwich, during the simultaneous watch for meteors on the nights
of the 5th to 12th of August last, are sufficiently accordant with the real

velocity of the Perseids (as already previously determined by similar means,

in the year 1863) to afford a satisfactory conclusion that the results of direct

observation are in very close agreement with those derived from the astro-

nomical theory of the August meteor-stream. Shooting-stars were observed

to be more than usually frequent on the nights of the 17th of August and

24th of September last, accompanying on the latter night a rather brilliant

display of the Aurora. On the nights of the 18th-20th of October last the

sky was bo generally overcast as to conceal the view of any meteoric shower
which may have taken place on that well-established meteoric date. But on the

mornings of 13th-loth of November last a satisfactory series of observations of

the November star-shower (so far as its return could be identified) recorded

at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, and at several other British stations,

concurs with very similar descriptions of its appearance in the United States

of America in showing the rapid decrease of intensity of this display since

the period of greatest brightness, which it attained in the years 1866 and

1867. Notices of the extreme brightness with which it was visible in the

following year (1868) are extracted from astronomical and meteorological

Ajournals kept in Switzerland and Scotland.  short view of the sky on the

night of the 12th of December last was obtained at Birmingham, where the

accurate divergence of the meteors observed by Mr. Wood from the radiant

point in Gemini of the December meteors sufficed to verify the periodical

return of that meteoric current. The state of the sky was not favourable

for observations of meteors on the first two nights of January ; but during

two hours, when the sky was clear, on the night of the 20th of April last,

the well-known group of April meteors was noted, on the periodical date,

diverging in considerable numbers, and with the characteristic features of

brightness, and leaving a persistent streak from the direction of a nearly fixed

centre in the constellation Lyra. One meteor of the shower, simultaneously

observed at Birmingham and Bury St. Edmunds, afforded sufficiently accu-

rate materials for calculating its real distance from the observers, and the

length and velocity of its visible flight relatively to the earth. The com-

bined observations of the regularly recurring meteor-showers during the

past j'ear having at present proved successful in contributing some valuable

materials to their history, the Committee propose to resume during the

coming year a systematic watch for their return, and to provide observers
OBSEKVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS.      27

of the regular star-showers of August and November, and those of smaller
interest and abundance in January, April, October, and December, with
suitable maps and instructions to enable them to obtain, without unnecessary
pains bestowed in preparations or expense, the most careful and complete
records of their extraordinary displays. In order that the operations of the

Committee may thus continue to be systematically directed towards the

objects which have acquired important interest from the discovery of the as-
tronomical connexion of shooting- stars with the orbits of comets, introducing

the strictest methods of inquiry into the laws of their appearance, the Com-

mittee earnestly desire the r^ewal, in the coming year, of the support which,
since its first formation, by their correspondence and cooperation, observers
have hitherto freely contributed to the British Association.

    Notices of the appearance of twenty-two fireballs and smaU bolides have
during the past year been received by the Committee, fourteen of which
were compared to the apparent size and brightness of the moon, and the

latter include three detonating meteors of the largest class. Descriptions of
some of the largest of these meteors are contained in the accompanying list

and in the following paragraphs of the Report. No notice of the fall of an

aerolite during the past year has been received, although the occurrences of
large meteors during the months of autumn and spring, preceding April last,
were more than ordinarily frequent. Of one of these, which appeared with
unusual brilliancy in Cornwall, Devonshire, and the south-western counties
of England on the evening of the 13th of February, it is possible to estimate,
at least approximately, the locality and the real elevation of its flight.

Careful observations of such phenomena when they appear are, however,
again recommended by the Committee to all observers who may have the

necessary astronomical skill, and the rare opportunity to note their brilliant
courses by the stars.

   In the discussion of some papers on Meteoric Astronomy which follow the
foregoing observations, it will be seen that in the hands of its talented origi-

nator. Prof. Schiaparelli, the cosmical theory of periodical shooting-stars has
received fresh and valuable illustrations, and the apparently inexplicable
grouping of radiant-points for several successive days in the neighbourhood
of a general centreof divergence, if not explained, appears to depend upon effects
of planetary disturbances of a single meteoric stream from which the parasitic

radiant-points have been derived. The discussion of such examples is sim-
plified, and their complete explanation is, perhaps, not beyond the reach of
the persevering application with which skilled astronomers in every country
are now bent on the solution of the complicated and intricate geometrical
problems presented to them by the distribution and features of the known
radiant-points of shooting-stars. To a brief description of this interesting
memoir are added, at the close of the Eeport, some notices of works which
have recently appeared on the more general branches of meteoric science.

simultaneously observed until the beginning of that year. The average

velocity of the Perseids, relatively to the earth, observed in the year 1863
was 34-4 miles per second, and that of the three Perseids satisfactorily well

observed in the present list is 37 miles per second. In his original letters to
Father Secchi on their connexion with Tattle's comet (Comet III., 1862),

now universally accepted as a true basis of their cosmical theory, Prof.

Schiaparelli calculated, from the known elements of the comet's orbit, that
the velocity with which the Perseids enter the earth's atmosphere (allowing

for a very minute influence of the earth's attraction) is 38 miles per second.
That the direct determination of the velocities of the August shooting-stars
which were made last year should, in this instance, so exactly agree with the
value found by calculation (although from the small number of identifiable
meteors the probable error of the determination is rather large), is, from the
great scale and general excellence of the observations, at least provisionally,
a successful confirmation of the astronomical theory of the August meteors,
and a satisfactory conclusion from the simultaneous watch.

   2. During the corresponding observations of the meteor-shower of No-
vember last, in which the observers of Mr. Glaisher's staff at the Eoyal

Observatory, Greenwich, also took an important share, the coincidence of
the times of appearance and of the other particulars of a single meteor only
of the shower simultaneously observed at Greenwich and at Tooting, near
London, could be established, the descriptions of which, as given by the
observers at those stations, were as follows :

     3. Preparations for observing the meteors of the 20th of April last were

     also made at many stations in England and Scotland with only partial

     Asuccess.  meteor of the April shower was, however, observed simul-

     taneously at Birmingham and Bury St. Edmunds, of which the following

at Birmingham, was directed), while this portion of the meteor's flight
appears to have entirely escaped observation at Birmingham. Prolonging
the meteor's visible flight at Birmingham 7° backwards towards the radiant-
point, and approaching the point of first appearance at Bury St. Edmunds
about the same distance towards the north pole of the heavens, the agree-
ment of the observations in fixing the point of first commencement at a
height of about eighty miles over the neighbourhood of Norwich is nearly

as exact as the determination of the place of the meteor's disappearance.

The length of its visible path was about seventy-five miles, and its radiant-
point in Taurus Poniatovii, on the same meridian, was about 40° south of

the usual radiant-point (QHJ of the April meteors. Although its apparent

course, as observed at Bury St. Edmunds, evidently denoted it as an erratic
member of the group, its general resemblance to the other Lyraids observed
on the same evening was a remarkable feature in its long and striking course.
Adopting Mr. "Wood's suggestion of (provisionally) increasing the duration,
as observed at Birmingham, from 1-25 to 2 seconds in the simple proportion
of the increased length of the apparent course, prolonged towards the radiant-
point, and adopting 2^ seconds (the average between this duration and that
recorded at Bury St. Edmunds) as the time of flight, the resulting velocity,
relative to the earth, of this single member of the April meteoric stream
doubly observed on the night of the 20th of April last, was, within very few
miles, about thirty miles per second. The theoretical velocity of the same

meteors (see the Note on the last page of this Eeport) is not quite thirty miles
per second.

   4, Several observations of the very brilliant firebaU observed in Devon-
shire and in the south-western counties of England on the evening of the
13th of February last were collected and compared together by Mr. Wood,
the result of whose investigation will shortly be given, with descriptions of
that meteor, as the most probable conjecture, from the materials at present
at their disposal, arrived at by the Committee respecting its real height and

the locality of its nearest approach to the British isles.

II. Large Meteoes.

   In addition to the conspicuous meteors described in the accompanying list,
the following descriptions of remarkable meteors have appeared, or were
communicated to the Committee by the observers :

night, at 1 1*" 30", through the blind of my bedroom windoiu. The whole room
was illuminated, and the meteor must have been at least half as large as the

November 4th. I was standing under the shade of a cluster of trees, when

a sudden flash of light fell around. Two or three camp fires were blazing

near, and at first I thought it might be a sudden flare up from one of them ;

but on casting my eyes up towards the heavens, I saw a large oval light,

stationary. It appeared to be composed of a large number of irregularly

shaped, differently sized stars, yet so closely packed as to form one light, yet

--giving the whole a sort of dappled appearance. At first I was struck dumb

with amazement thought it must be some mental illusion, or that my eyes

were playing me false. But as I gazed it remained steadily fixed.    ,

of Allahabad, was with me. I roused him ; he was soundly asleep, and some
seconds passed in waking him up. In the interval it appeared to have been

lengthened, nearly, though not quite, by a straight line, and as we gazed it

assumed the shape of a large magnet, with the upper limb rather shorter than

the other. It then gradually expanded, diminishing in brightness as it in-

creased in size, assuming a wavy, serpentine form, though keeping much to

a horseshoe shape, until it became so attenuated as to be no longer visible.

It must have continued in sight five minutes. It was seen by all the ser-

vants and one of them cried out, ' Bhagwauka seela hae,' by which he ap-
                                 ;

peared to mean that in his opinion the Almighty was amusing Himself with

fireworks ; literally, ' It is God's sport or amusement.' " Nature, Jan. 12th,

gh 4(jni J noticed the descent of a beautiful meteor. It appeared to start

almost from the zenith towards the S.S.E., and it was visible for about three

seconds. It had very much the appearance of a sky-rocket in its flight, but

without any explosion, and it displayed vivid red and orange colours. The

evening was very dark, but the stars were visible ; the meteor did not in-

crease the amount of light in the place where I was walking. According

myto ' star-map,' I should lay down its course as follows." [See the sketch

of the meteor's course.]-- T. HrurHKEY, Hawkhurst, Dec. 20th, 1870.

  4. 1871, Feb. 13, 9"^ 4TM p.m., Bristol.-- "I saw a very briUiant meteor

last evening, February 13th, at 9^ 4TM. During the time that it continued
visible the whole of the sky was illuminated by the light it emitted. The
first appearance of the meteor was not witnessed, but the direction and
situation of the latter portion of its path was approximately determined. It
passed through the S. part of Orion, just under Eigel, so [see sketch] :

It disappeared near B, which is equal to about R.A. 4'' 10TM, Decl. S. 15°.

AAt it left a train about 2° in length, -which endured for ten minutes. In

that portion of the sky near which the meteor disappeared many stratus

--clouds were visible.
    " P.S. I omitted to state that the brilliancy of the meteor excelled that

of any of the planets. When at its brightest the light was about equal to that

of a clear full moon. I only saw the disappearance." William F. Denning,

Bristol, February 14th, 1871.

At Rugby the meteor was observed very bright at about %^ 10TM p.m., and

it was described as " starting from near Orionis, and proceeding towards a

point a little north of y Eridani, when it was lost behind a belt of cloud."
(Communicated to 'Nature,' February 16th, 1871, by J. M. Wilson.)

These two descriptions of its visible path (apparently from the relative

positions of the stations) are so similar that little can be certainly concluded

from them regarding the real distance of the meteor.

At Exeter " a briUiant meteor traversed the constellation of Orion, ap-

pearing near the Belt and passing from south to west. The direction was

south-west, altitude 35°. Its light equalled or exceeded that of fuU moon,

and it left a train of colours for some time." (' English Mechanic,' Feb. 24th.)

At Torquay, " The meteor started near BeUatrix in Orion, altitude 35°,

passing due west, leaving in its track a brilliant train of colours, green pre-

dominating." (Ibid., March 3rd.)

The meteor was also seen at Callington, in Cornwall, casting a brilliant dif-

fused light, and occupjdng two seconds in its transit. (Ibid.)

   By comparing together the foregoing observations of its course, and obtain-

ing an approximate estimation of its real height, Mr. Wood is led to adopt

the following provisional positions of its visible track. The meteor first

appeared at an elevation of fifty-five miles over the English Channel, seventy

miles S.S.W. from Torquay. It thence descended, with an inclination of

16°, to a height of thirty-five miles over a point sixty-four miles west of

Torquay, thus describing, from S.E. by S. to N.W. by N., a path of eighty

miles in two seconds, across the centre of the county of Cornwall, terminating

at its western coast, near St. Columb Minor. The radiant of the meteor was

near a Hydras. As the meteor was probably distinctly seen in Cornwall, the

Scilly Isles, and in the south of Ireland, additional descriptions of its appa-

rent course from those places, as seen from points considerably west of the

place where it appears to have approached the earth, would afford the best

materials for verifying the present approximate conjecture of its real path.

As seen at Torquay, it was .notably described by an observer to Mr. Greg as

lighting up the whole bay and presenting a magnificent appearance.

38 REPORT 1871.

   The analysis of the last of these meteorites by Mr. Tschermak (Jahrbuch
fiir Mineralogie, for 1871, p. 412) shows approximately the following com-

position :

Iron.       Ilydrocarbon.  Olivine.  Enstatite. Magnetic Pyrites.

8-49           +0-85       +61-72    +30-01  +(traces) =101-07.

   The occurrence of carbonaceous matter in the meteorites of Hessle, Upsala
(1st January, 1869), was recently also recognized by Nordenskjold, who

found in them a black flocculent substance, containing 71 per cent, of

carbon. (The ' Academy,' August loth, 1871.)

 --1. Meteor-sliowers in January and February 1837. From the tracks of

meteors recorded in the last annual Catalogue of the British Association, and
in the ' Bulletin of the Moncalieri Observatory' for November 1869, observed
during the months of January and February of that year, Mr. Greg has

established the existence of the following old, and of one new radiant-point,

which made their appearance in those months :

     2. The Meteor-shower of November 1868, which was seen in its greatest
 brilliancy in the United States of America, and which was also partially

 recorded at Glasgow, by Professor Grant, between 5 and 6 o'clock on the
 morning of the 14th of November, was observed at the same hours in the
 north of Scotland, and described in the ' Journal of the Scottish Meteorolo-

--gical Society' (for December 1868) : ^^ Meteors and Falling-stars. The star-

 shower of the 13th and 14th of November was observed at many of the

--stations. In the north it was very fine. Mr. Clark, the observer at North

 Unst, writes : ' On the morning of the 14th there was a great falling of

 shootiug-stai's from all directions of the sky ; it was something like a shower

 of stars.' And the Rev. Dr. Hamilton observes that at Bressay ' There

 was an extraordinary meteoric shower, which continued from 3"" 30TM a.m. of
the 13th [? 14th] till the sun rose, and the number of stars or meteors falling
 was innumerable.' " The following descriptions of its appearance in Swit-
 zerland are given by Dr. Rudolf Wolf in his 'Astronomical Contributions':
'« 1868, November 13th : from 12'' 5"> to 12'^ 15"" I saw four, from 12'^ IS"
 to 12" 30" nine, and from 12'^ 30" to 12'^ 40" two brilliant meteors radia-
 ting from the constellation Leo. The sky (up to the latter time quite clear)

 then clouded over from the east, and all further view of the meteors at

--Ziirich was prevented. Mr. Rieder, at Klosters, reports: 'As an unusual

 phenomenon I have to state that at 4*^ 15" on the morning of the 14th of
November, 1868, an extraordinary number of shooting- stars were visible in
the western sky ; from five untU six o'clock a real rain of shooting-stars took
place, diffusing such great brightness that one might easily have read by

their light. Several of the meteors left streaks of bright light in the sky,

which remained visible for two or three seconds.' At Eugelberg ' from five
until after six o'clock a.m. on the morning of the 14th of November, repeated

flashes of lightning were perceived, and shortly before five o'clock a swiftly
passing flash, like a ball of light, was observed, whilst the sky was com-

pletely overcast.' " An admirably compiled history of the November pheno-

menon in the year 1868, comprising the exact details of observations at aU
the places where it was well observed, and notices of its general description

at places in all parts of Europe, the United States of America, and the
Atlantic, where it was witnessed, is published in his Memoirs V. and VI., on
' Shooting-stars of November 1868 and August 1869,' by Sig. F. Denza. The
 same volume contains (in the sixth memoir) an equally full collection of obser-
 vations and theoretical deductions of great value regarding the appearance of

the August meteor-shower in the year 1869. Among the latter may be cited

the suggestion of Professor Newton *, borne out by the observations of the
shower made in America, and by those of Professor Serpieri at Urbino in

that yearf, that the radiant-region of the Perseids is in reality a narrow,

elongated space extending from near the cluster at ^ Persei to the star B

(B. A. C. 1058) Camelopardi. The radiant-region of the Leonids in the pre-
vious year was similarly observed by Professor Newton to be better repre-
sented by a short line extending between the stars e, y Leonis, from about the
star .r, in the centre of the Sickle (B. A. C. 3423), to the latter star, than by a
single point. The direction of elongation of the radiant-region is towards the
sun's apparent place, a conclusion which is regarded by Prof. Newton as throw-
ing light of some importance upon the theory of the November meteor-stream.

40 REPORT 1871.

--3. TJie August Shower in 1870. In the 'Meteorological Bulletin' of the

Moncalieri Observatory for October 1870, the first results of observations in

Piedmont on the star-shower of the 10th and 11th of August last are com-

municated. As already observed in the last Report, the frequency of the

meteors did not exceed the ordinary average of the shower, and they were

somewhat more frequent on the night of the 10th than on that of the 11th

of August. They appeared to proceed from several radiant-points, besides

the principal one of the shower, in Perseus. Among the contemjjoraneous

radiant-points, T^, Pj (the former occurring in August in Pegasus, and the

latter usually appearing in Auriga in the latter part of September) were

--observed to be conspicuous.
   4. The November Shower in 1870. The preparations made for recording

the return of the November meteors in 1870 were in a great measure disap-

pointed by the cloudy state of the sky at several of the English stations.

The following letter from Mr. Backhouse announced a more favourable

condition of the sky at Sunderland on the morning of the 14th of November

than that which prevailed at Manchester, Birmingham, York, and London,

where no meteors of the shower could be observed :

   " Between 2" 20"° and 3'' 42"^ a.m., on the 14th, I watched for meteors ; I
only saw seven in fifty-six minutes, watching in a cloudless sky. Of these

only four belonged to the shower. I enclose the particulars. I did not

--watch much on the morning of the 15th. It was mostly cloudy, and I saw

no meteors." Of the conformable meteors two left trains, one was station-

ary close to, and the others radiating very nearly from, the small star x

Leonis. The unconformable meteors appeared with short courses in and near

the constellation Taurus, and of these one was as bright as Sirius. It was

of a yellow colour, describing a path of 3°, near e Arietis, from the direction

of the Pleiades, and it left no streak.

Five meteors, from undetermined radiant-points, were seen through breaks

in the clouds by Mr. J. E. Clark, at York, on the morning of the 14th, and

two Leonids of some brightness, in a watch of one hour (interrupted by the

clouds), on the morning of the 1.5th of November.

On the morning of the 14th of November the sky was clear at Glasgow

from 2^ lOTM until 5'' 15"" a.m., and twenty-six meteors were recorded by

Mr. A. S. Herschel, of which twenty-one were conformable. Of the latter

the paths of eleven, prolonged backwards, crossed, and of five passed close to

the curve of Leo's sickle. Seven meteors left persistent streaks, which were

faintly visible in the full moonlight. The proportion of magnitudes of the

conformable meteors was :--

                                         3

Meteors of smaller magnitudes were rendered invisible by the moon's light

and the most striking conformable meteor of the shower, recorded at
4'' 25" A.M., was as bright as Sirius. It described a course of 25°, directed

nearly from fi Leonis, in three-quarters of a second, and left a broad streak
on its whole path for two seconds. The following numbers of conformable

and unconformable meteors were recorded in the half-hours ending at

In the fii'st and last half-hours the sky was partially concealed by clouds
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

leaving streaks directed from Leo, appeared almost together. In the next

half-hour two meteors, directed apparentlj'' from Cor Caroli, appeared to be
unconformable to the Leo radiant. The remaining unconformable meteors

aU proceeded from the direction of a radiant-point in Taurus. At 5'' 15TM a.m.

the sky became completely overcast ; but a shooting-star from the direction
of Leo, of first magnitude, was observed by Mr. E,. Maclure, at 6'' 20TM a.m.,

through an opening of the clouds. On the morning of the 15th the sky at

Glasgow was again completely overcast.

On the evening of the 13th a bright meteor (described in the above List)

was seen at the Eoyal Observatory, Greenwich, and three vivid flashes of

light, between 12"^ 15TM and 12'' 30TM a.m., on the 14th, which must have pro-

ceeded from large meteors, at an altitude of about 20°, due S. were seen

through the clouds, which from this time overspread the sky during the

remainder of the night. On the morning of the 15th a clear sky enabled

Mr. Glaisher's staff of observers to make continuous observations of the

meteors visible in the bright moonlight, from midnight until 5'' 33TM a.m.,

when the sky was again quite obscured bj" clouds. Fifty-three meteors were

recorded, in this interval by the five observers, the apparent paths of forty-

five of which were traced upon a map. Of the meteors so recorded, twenty-

eight proceeded from the usual radiant-point in Leo, eight from a radiant-

point situated apparently not far from Cor Caroli, seven from a radiaut-point

between Taurus and Musca, and two meteors from uncertain radiant-points.

A very beautiful meteor of bluish-white colour, and of the apparent size and

brightness of Jupiter, proceeding apparently from the direction of the radiant-
point in Musca, descended towards the east, at 4'' 45TM 25* a.m., through an

arc of more than 25°, in about three seconds, leaving a streak of light upon

its course. Most of the conformable meteors left a persistent train, but none

of those observed rivalled this fine meteor in brightness or in length of

course. The proportion of apparent magnitudes of the remaining meteors,

seen during the watch is shown in the following list :

Brighter tban first-magnitude stars ; =i8tdo. ; =2nd do. ; = 3rd do. Total

Number of meteors seen 6 24 17 5 52

From these descriptions of the meteor-shower it appears that, on both the

mornings of the 14th and 15th of November, the number of the conformable

meteors considerably exceeded that of the unconformable meteors which

appeared duiing the hours of the continued watch ; but that the scale of the
shower, as it was observed iu England, was very far inferior to the brightness

with which it was recorded in the preceding year.

At Tooting, near London, Mr. H. W. Jackson observed on the mornings of

the 14th, 15th, and 16th of November, and noted one shooting-star on the

night of the 13th, but failed, on account of haze and clouds, followed by rain

during the morning of the 14th, in securing another observation. Between
midnight and 1^ 55TM a.m., on the morning of the 1.5th, eight meteors were

carefully observed and mapped, and four or five smaller meteors were seen,

all but two of which (of short course, near the radiant-point in Taurus) were
conformable to the Leo radiant-point. Of these, the brightest, at l** 5TM a.m.,

which left a long streak, was simultaneously observed at Greenwich. Of the

two unconformable meteors, that which appeared at 12'' 7TM a.m. was white

and nearly as bright as Jupiter, moving for two seconds in a slightly curved

course from r to \p Orionis, and leaving a short streak upon its track.

Flashes of faint reddish lightning were perceived at 12'' 28" and 12'' SS" a.m.

Between 12'' 30"" and 1" 30"" a.m. on the morning of the 16th some meteors

were observed, but did not appear to present features worthy of special note.

At Newhaven, in the United States, three observers noted, in three hours,

thirty-one meteors, of which only six were conformable to the radiant-point

in Leo. On the following morning (the 14th) Professor Newton, with five

other observers, obtained the following enumeration of the meteors visible in

the half-hours ending at 1870, November 14th, a.m. :

After 3'' 45"" the sky was so nearly overcast that regular counting was

abandoned, while in open spaces of the sky it was still apparent that up to

six o'clock no marked increase in the number of the meteors had taken place.

After half-past five, however, the clouds already began more nearly to cover

--the sky. (American Journal of Science and Arts, vol. i., January 1871.)
   5. Meteor-shower of December 12t7i, 1870. The state of the sky was not

generally favourable for observations, Mr. H. W. Jackson reporting from

Louth that on the nights of the 12th and 13th the sky was overcast, with

frequent rain from 8" 30"" p.m. on the night of the 12th. At Glasgow, York,

and Manchester it was equally obscured. At Birmingham Mr. "W. H. Wood

was more fortunate in securing a short view of the sky on one of the periodic

--nights, and the following is his description of the shower :

"The overcast state of the skies from the 10th to the 13th permitted only

of a partial view of the character of the shower, which occurred during a

temporary clearance of the sky for one hour only, from 11'' 30"" p.m. on the

12th to 12'' 30'" A.M. on the 13th. Five meteors were recorded in three-

quarters of an hour, radiating accurately from radiant G (6 Geminorum).

AMeteors white or blue, and trainless (one observer)."  list of the recorded

paths, and a description of the meteors seen, accompanies Mr. Wood's report.

The position of the radiant-point from which the meteors approximately

diverged was near the stars k- and g, in Gemini.

   No observations were recorded, owing to a cloudy state of the sky, on the

--shower-meteor nights of the 1st and 2nd of January, 1871.
   6. Meteor-shower of April 20th, 1871. The last weU-marked appearance

of the ApiH meteor-shower, to the annual occurrence of which attention

was first drawn by Herrick, in the United States, took place on the morning

of the 21st of April, 1863 1, when, for a few hours, meteors were observed

by Mr. Wood, at Weston-super-Mare, to be as frequent as in a moderately

bright August star-shower. Two Julian intervals of four years each having

elapsed since that occurrence, the astronomical conditions of its reappearance

suggested special preparations and a simultaneous watch, which were ac-
cordingly made for its return. Besides the staflp of observers at the Eoyal

Observatory, Greenwich, Mr. Glaisher's son, Mr. James Glaisher, volunteered

to take part in the observations at Cambridge, where Professor Adams also

offered his aid, to join in recording the shooting-stars which might be visible at

the Obsei-vatory. The other observers who awaited the display were those
who have most frequently assisted the Committee by their recorded observa-

tions at Glasgow, York, Manchester, Birmingham, and London. Such, how-

ever, was the unfavourable state of the sky which prevailed during the
forty-eight hours intended to have been devoted to the watch (and which
continued to prevent further observations during the last remaining nights
of the months of April), that with the exception of a few meteors of the

shower observed by Mr. Wood at Birmingham, and of the corresponding

group of meteors recorded by Mr. Herschel at Bury St. Edmunds, no un-
broken series of observations were received. The sky first became quite clear
at the latter place at 9*^ 30" p.m., and the following numbers of meteors were

seen in the half-hours ending at        hm

All but eight of their apparent paths, projected upon a map, when prolonged

backwards, pass across a circular area about 15° in width, of which the

centre is at a point in R. A. 267°, N. Decl. 35°. Nine of these conformable

meteors left bright trains. Of the eight unconformable meteors, four are

widely erratic meteors of the same shower, and the remaining four moving

in the opposite direction were directed from an unknown radiant-point in the

south. The path of one of the latter was remarkably serpentine in the latter

portion of the meteor's course. The following are the numbers of meteors of

the different magnitudes observed :

The last meteor was observed at 12'' 35TM a.m. on the 21st. The sky then
rapidly clouding over did not permit the progress of the shower, at Bury St.
Edmunds, to be further watched. On the previous and on the following

night the sky was also cloudj\

   At Birmingham Mr. W. H. "Wood recorded the appearance of nine

shooting-stars between the hours of lO"" 20TM and 11''30TM p.m. on the night of
the 20th of April, five of which were noted in the fii'st, and four in the latter

half of the watch ; five meteors diverged from the constellation Lyra, three
from that of Corona, and the remaining meteor moved transversely to the
former ones from the neighbourhood of Polaris. The numbers of meteors

= = =seen of different magnitudes were, l Sirius, 2 lst mag.*, l 3rd do.,
=5 4th do. : total 9 meteors. The brightest meteor of the shower moved with a

nucleus of briUiaut blue, flickering light, about the brightness of Sirius, from the

direction of Corona. Soon after half-past 11 o'clock the sky became over-

cast, and remained so at I'' and 2^ a.m. on the morning of the 21st, when
regular watching was abandoned. The maximum, as far as could be ascer-

tained from these observations, occurred after midnight on the morning of

the 21st ; the rate of apparition for one observer, while the sk)'^ was clear,

being seven or eight per hour between ten and eleven o'clock, and twelve or
fifteen per hour during the half-hour immediately before and that imme-
diately after midnight. Between ll** 15TM and 11'' 45TM p.m. on the night of

the 2ist, Mr. Wood observed no meteors at Birmingham, although one-third

of the sky was visible, quite clear, through the broken clouds. The appear-

ance of the April shower in this year appears, therefore, to have taken place

on the date and at about the hour expected for its return, from the time

  of its last conspicuous appearance.

  --7. Meteor-shower of July 1871. At sea, between Norway and England,

  Mr. A. S. Herschel watched for the periodical meteors (first pointed out by
. Capocci, at Naples) on the night of the 16th of July. The sky was perfectly

  clear from ll** p.m. until 2'' a.m. on the morning of the 17th of July, and
44 REPORT 1871.

seventeen meteors were observed, six in the first, six in the' second, and

five in the third hour of the watch. On the night of the 17th the sky was

again clear ; but three meteors only were observed in three-quarters of an

hour, between 10'' 55" and ll*" 40" p.m. The meteors observed on both

nights were small, and appeared generally with short courses near a radiant-

region around tt Herculis, from which they appeared to diverge. The num-
=ber of meteors seen of the different magnitudes were, 2 1st mag.*, 4=2nd,

4= 6= =3rd,

   1. Under the title * Alcuni Resiiltati Preliminari tratti dalle osservazioni

di SteUe Cadcnti publicate neUe Effemeride degli anni 1868, 1869, 1870;'
Professor Schiaparelli communicates, in connexion with the three Catalogues

of Shooting-Stars observed in Italy, published in the Ephemeris of the Milan
Observatory for the years 1868, 1869, and 1870, a first report on the radiant-
points obtained by mapping the meteor-tracks contained in them from Janu-
ary to June. For a convenient nomenclature of the radiant-points, the year

is divided into seventy-two pentads, of five days each, of which six are con-
tained in every month. While the first five pentads in every month are
complete, the sixth, and last, consists of three, four, five, or six days, ac-
cording to the length of the month to which it belongs. Since, however, the

observations for a single night of the year only (collected from all the years)

are combined together to detect the radiant-points, of which several may
occur in each pentad, the letters of the alphabet added to the Roman num-
ber of a pentad (thus, XIX. a) designate the radiant-points in those pentads in

the order in which they were successively discovered by Professor Schia-
parelli. Besides a strict separation of meteors observed on one from those
observed on the next following or on the next preceding night, to avoid the
risk of confusing together meteors belonging to different radiant-points under
a false assemblage of two radiant-points into a single meteoric-shower. Pro-

fessor Schiaparelli distinguishes as different meteor-currents those whose
radiant-points, as shown by laying down the recorded paths, are more than
10° apart. The precision with which the radiant-points must be determined
(from the shooting-star observations of a sinr/le night) is necessarily very

great, in order that this rule may be rigorously appUed. Even omitting the

errors of observation (which are frequently considerable), it is found that
different meteoric showers present different characters of radiation. In some
the radiant-region is small, and the meteor-tracks prolonged backwards meet

nearly in a point, when it is caUed " exact "; in others it is larger, the meteor-
tracks prolonged backwards crossing each other in a confused manner over a
considerable apparent space, in which case it is called " diffuse." The
shooting -stars which make their appearance witliin the radiant-region (when
this is rather large) may appear to be moving in every variety of opposite direc-
tions, and their paths are usually noticed to be extremely foreshortened by
perspective in this position. Lastly, if they diverge from two or more points

the character of the radiation is said to be double or multiple ; and it ap-
pears probable, on certain theoretical grounds, which will be shortly stated,
that a diffuse radiant-region in general arises from the close assemblage of

many radiant-points togetherinto a multiple group. The November meteor-

shower is an example of exact, and the August star-shower an instance

either of multii^le or of diffuse radiation, according to the various descriptions

of the observers who have examined the direction of its radiant-point most

attentively. Meteoric showers composed principally of very smaU shooting-

stars are confined to the parts of the heavens immediately surrounding the

radiant-point ; while those consisting of large meteors spread far from the

centre of divergence, the meteors (apparently from their brightness) being as

plainly visible when they are seen by transverse as when they are seen fore-

shortened by very oblique vision. Meteor- showers of the former kind are

called "contracted"; and of the latter kind "extended" (stretta; larga). The

foregoing are the principal terms employed by Professor Schiaparelli in de-

scribing the meteor-showers of which the positions of the radiant-points have

now been published. The explanation of the phenomena of " diffuse " and

" multiple " radiant-points is ingeniously supplied by Professor Schiaparelli

Ain the following manner.  very small nebular mass of meteoroids or of

cometoids having been deflected from its original parabolic (or very excen-

tric) into an orbit of moderate period round the sun by the attraction of some

powerful planet in its path, the foremost and swiftest particles of the stream

produced by this disturbance gradually gaining, and the slowest losing

ground on the central particles of the mass, an elongated form of the mass is

gradually assumed directed along the line of the meteoric orbit. The dif-

ference of velocity, or of periodic time, between the foremost and hindmost

particles of the row is sufficient to ensure the gradual lengthening of the line,

until the foremost particle joins with the last in forming a continuous ring or

wreath of meteoric substance closing the orbit of the original meteoric clond.

Should the two ends, before meeting each other (as must usually be the case),

have undergone different pertui'bations from the action of the planets, in-

stead of exactly overtaking the retreating end, the foremost end of the wreath

will overlap it, and the meteor-stream will begin to assume the form of a

spiral curve of a single coil. When the foremost end has gained two revolu-

tions upon the retreating one, a spiral of two coils wiU be produced ; and
continuing this process during many revohitions gained by one end of the

coil upon the other, the wreath of meteoroids, without losing its continuity,

wiU at last form an endless hoop, or belt, of many strands overlying and

interlacing with each other in as many convolutions as the fastest particles

have gained revolutions in their course upon the slower ones. The direction

and velocity of the particles in one of the strands wiU also differ as widely as

their positions from those of particles in a neighbouring strand, and the whole

wreath, without ever losing its perfect continuity from end to end, will cross

and recross itself in constantly going and returning waves. In these stages

of transformation a meteoric stream woiild si;ccessively exhibit the characters

of double and multiple radiant-points. Supposing the same process to con-

tinue,, and new perturbations of the stream to be constantly deflecting par-

ticles fi'om the front or rear into different courses, these particles overtaking

each other at the point where the earth passes through the stream would
produce the mixed assemblage of radiant-points and of dii'ections of the
meteors of the August shower, which give it the character of multiple or of
diffuse radiation. In the following list of radiant-points those marked with
an asterisk (*) were described in the last Eeport (1870, p. 98) ; those at the
end of the list are not included by Prof. Schiapai'elli in his present list, which
only represents the most important radiant-points observed, at present, in the
first half of the year. In the cases where their identity with radiant-points

in Heis's list, or in that of the British Association t, is suggested by Pro-
fessor Schiaparelh, the position and duration of those radiant-points are
added for comparison in the same columns of the Table.

may have transformed the original orbits of many of the former as well as of

the latter into ellipses. It is an interesting fact that the motions of some

luminons meteors (or cometoids, as, perhaps, they might be called) have been

decidedly indicative of an origin beyond the limits of the planetary system.

But how are the phenomena of periodic meteors to be accounted for in ac-

cordance with this theory?

" The division of Biela's comet into two distinct parts suggests several

interesting questions in cometary physics. The nature of the separating

force remains to be discovered ; ' but it is impossible to doubt that it arose

from the divellent action of the sun, whatever may have been the mode of

Aoperation.  signal manifestation of the influence of the sun is sometimes

afforded by the breaking up of a comet into two or more separate parts, on

the occasion of its approach to the perihelion ' *. No less than six such in-

--stances are found distinctly recorded in the Annals of Astronomy, viz. : 1.

Ancient bipartition of a comet. Seneca. 2. Separation of a comet into a

number of fragments, 11 B.C. Dion Cassius. 3. Three comets seen simul-

taneously pursuing the same orbit, a.d. 896. Chinese Records. 4. Probable

sejDaration of a comet into parts, a.b. IQIS.--Hevelius. 5. Indications of

seimration, 1661. HeveVms. 6. Bipartition of Biela's Comet, 1845-46.
   " In \dew of these facts it seems highly probable, if not absolutely certain,

that the process of division has taken place in several instances besides that

of Biela's Comet. May not the force, whatever it is, that has produced one
separation again divide the parts ? And may not this action continue until

the fragments become invisible ? According to the theory now generally

received, the periodic phenomena of shooting-stars are produced by the inter-

section of the orbits of such nebulous bodies with the earth's annual path.

Now there is reason to believe that these meteoric rings are very elliptical,

and in this respect wholly dissimilar to the rings of primitive vapour which,

according to the nebular hypothesis, were successively abandoned at the solar

equator ; in other words, that the matter of which they are composed moves

in cometary rather than in planetary orbits. May not our periodic meteors

be the debris of ancient but now disintegrated comets, whose matter has be-
come distributed round their orbits ? "

These views, announced in the year 1861, were afterwards completely

established by the calculations of Professor Newton and Professor Schia-

pareUi regarding the real orbital velocities of shooting-stars, proving them

to move, generally, in parabolic, or cometic, rather than in planetary orbits

and by the astonishing discovery in the year 1866, by Professor Schiaparelli,

of the almost absolute identity of the orbit of Tuttle's Comet (III. 1862) with

that of the August, and of the orbit of Temple's Comet (I. 1866) with that

of the November meteor-stream, supposing (as the researches of Professor

Newton and Professor Adams amply prove) that the latter, and presumably

also the former of those meteor-clouds revolve in elliptic orbits of such

considerable length, as not to differ much from the comets in their times

of revolution. In his communication to the American Philosophical Society,

Professor Kirkwood retraces the recent researches of Hoek, Leverrier, and

SchiapareUi respecting the probable circumstances of the introduction of

comets and periodical shooting-stars ab extra into the limits of the planetary

system. The disturbing force by which their cosmical orbits were converted

into elliptic ones of short periods (it is found in harmony with the preceding

theory) was probably the overpowering attraction of one of the larger planets

near to which the cosmical bodies first entered the limits of the solar system.

It is also evident that the passage of the solar system through a region of

space comparatively destitute of cometie clusters would be indicated by a

corresponding paucity of comets. Such variations of frequency are, indeed,

found not only in the records of comets, but also of meteoric showers which
have been accidentally recorded, the greater number of the latter having

been observed during the five centuries between TOO a.d. and 1200 a.d., and

again in those following a.d. 1700, suggesting that dm-ing the former and,

perhaps, again during the present period the solar system is passing through

--a cosmical or meteoric cloud of very great extent, not less, indeed, on the

received speed of the sun's proper motion, than fourteen times the -width of

Neptune's orbit. Professor Kirkwood adds, in particular reference to the

August meteor-system, " The fact that the Aiigust meteors, which have been

so often subsequently observed, were first noticed in 811 [see M. Quetelet's

Catalogue of Star-showers] renders it probable that the cluster was intro-

duced into the planetary system not long pre-viously to the year 800. It may

be also worthy of remark that the elements of the comet of 770 a.d. are not

very different from those of the August meteors and of the third comet of

1682 " *. With regard to the sun's passage through

a meteoric cloud of the above-considered dimen-

sions and constitution it is noticed that the num-

ber of coraetary perihelia found in the two qua-            260^
drants of longitude towards and from which the sun

is moving is 159, or 62 per cent., and that of peri-

helia in the two other quadrants is 98, or .38 per

cent., shoAving their tendency to crowd together

about the direction of the sun's proper motion in space. The large excess of

    * The interval bet-ween tbe perihelion passage of 770 and that of 1862 is equal to 9

periods of 121-36 years. Oppolzer's determination of the period of 1862, III., is 121-5

years. Hind remarks that the elements of the Comet of 770 are " rather uncertain," but
says " that the general character of the orbit is decided." It may be worthy of remari

that a great meteoric sbo-wer, the exact date of which has not been preserved, occurred ir

770.

the number of the cometary perihelia closest to the sun in the forward qua-

irants, relatively to the direction of his proper motion in space, is also re-

garded as indicating the direction of the sun's motion through the meteor-
;loud in a manner which the facts of observation evidently corroborate.

  3. On the Periods of certain Meteoric rings. By Professor Kirkwood (read
;o the American Philosophical Society, March 4, 1870).--According to the

iomputed elements of the Comet I. 1861 (by Oppolzer), first shown by Dr.
Edmund Weiss (Astron. Kachr. no. 1632) to agree very closely with those of

he April meteor-stream, its periodic time of revolution is 415-4 years. On

he other hand, Professor Kirkwood points out that, without accepting a shorter

)eriodic time of revolution, the former April displays recorded in ancient
imes do not agree with the time of revolution of the comet. Adopting a

)eriod of about 28^ years for the cycle of returns of the April shower, the

vhole of the dates of its appearance selected by Professor ll^ewton as agre'eing

veil with those of its most recent appearance in the present century are re-
iresented with perfect accuracy by the following scheme :

Dates of former appearances.     Interval in years.

The periodical time of 28^ years corresponds to an ellipse whose major

xis is 18-59, and whose aphelion distance is very nearly equal to the mean
Alistance of the planet Uranus.
                                 remark of Mr. Du Chaillu is here believed

to be rightly recalled, that he observed the April meteors in the equatorial

parts of Africa almost as brilliant, and leaving streaks more enduring than

those of the great November meteor-shower (of which he was also an ob-

server in England, in the year 1866). If the date of Mr. Du ChaiUu's obser-

vation was about the year 1860, a corroboration of Professor Kirkwood'a

cycle of 28^ years repeated twice since the great display of those meteors in

the year 1803 would be thence derived. The April meteor-shower was also

sufficiently bright in the year 1863 to make its approach to an epoch of
maximum brilliancy in about that year a somewhat probable conjecture.

   Among the formerly recorded star-showers which appear to have certainly

been connected with the December meteor-system. Professor Kirkwood points

out a notice of such an occurrence in the year a.d. 901. Others are found

to have taken place in the years 930, 1571, 1830, 1833, and 1836, with an

apparent maximum in the year 1833, when as many as ten meteors were

seen simultaneously. Finally, pretty abundant displavs of the shower were

observed in the years 1861, 1862, and 1863, with a jprobable maximum in

the year 1862. These dates indicate a period of about 29^ years, thus^

       901 to 930                I period of 29000 years.

  A third meteoric shower, that of the 15th-21st of October, presents, again,

ma similar period of revolution. The recorded dates of apparitions which cor-

respond the times of their appearance with the present meteor-showers of
the 15th-21st of October are the years a.d. 288, 1436 and 1439, 1743, and

1798, on each of which occasions a great number of shooting-stars were

                                                                                e2

seen. The periodic time of 27| years is well indicated by these dates,

thus :

A.D. 288 to 1439                                42 periods of 27-405 years each.
       1439 to 1743

    " If these periods are correct, it is a remarkable coincidence that the
aphelion distances of the meteoric rings of April 18th-20th, October 15th-
21st, November 14th, and December llth-13th, as well as those of the

comets 1866 I., and 1867 I. are all nearly equal to the mean distance of

Uranus."

presents a short summary of the mathematical problems required to be

solved in the determination of the parabolic orbit, and the actual relative

speed of the meteors' course in the atmosphere, from the known position of
the radiant-point ; and shows how approximate calculations of the velocities

of shooting-stars have led to discoveries, in proving certain periodical meteor-
currents to be intimately connected with comets of which the orbits have

recently been determined*.

 --5, The Fuel of the Sun, by W. Mattieu WiUiams, F.C.S. (8vo, 222 pp.

Simpkin and Marshall). An attempt to explain convulsions of the sun's sur-

face by planetary disturbances of a universal atmosphere collected in greatest
density about the larger bodies of the solar system, and agitated by tides

arising from their several attractions, is the theory for the establishment of

which a collection of the greatest interest of recent observations of solar
physics has been brought into a small compass by the author of the work,
and is well directed to explain the chief phenomena of solar physics. The
corona is regarded (Chapter XIII.) as originating in solar projectiles driven
from its surface with eruptive violence. In the following chapter the source
of meteorites is conjectured to be the solar projectiles which thus pass beyond
the boundaries of the zodiacal light ; some of which being confined to revolve
in two principal orbits outside of that luminary, and in several intermediate

zones of irregularly and more thinly scattered projectiles, may be regarded

as giving rise to the August and November, as well as to other minor and
more or less regular meteoric displays. Somewhat more important specu-
lations and descriptions of the meteorology of the moon and planets, as well
 as of the distribution of the nebulae, suggesting the stellar origin of some of
 those bodies, occupy the greater portion of the remainder of the work.

relatively' to the earth, is given in Dr. Weiss's list of radiant-points and relative velocities of

    Since noticing the occurrence of an Isopod, Palcega Carteri, from the
Kentish, Cambridge, and Bedford Chalk, Dr. Ferd. Eoemer, of Breslau, has

forwarded me the cast of a specimen of the same crustacean from the Chalk

of Upper Silesia. This, together with the example from the Miocene of

Turin, gives a very wide geographical as weU as chronological range to this

genus.

   A still more remarkable extension of the Isopoda in time is caused by the

discovery of the form which I have named Prceardurus in the Devonian of

Herefordshire, apparently the remains of a gigantic Isopod resembling the

modern Arcturus Bcrffinsii.
    I have also described from the Lower Ludlow a form which I have referred

with some doubts to the Amphipoda, under the generic name of Necrogam-

marus.

    Bepresentatives both of the Isopoda and Amphipoda vrill doubtless be
found in numbers in our Palaeozoic rocks, seeing that Macruran Decapods
are found as far back as the Coal-measures*, and Brachyurous forms in the

Oolites f.

    Indeed the suggestion made by Mr. Billings as to the Trilobita being fur-

 nished with legs (see Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. vol. xxvi. pi. 31. fig. 1), if
established upon further evidence, so as to be applied to the whole class,
would carry the Isopodous type back in time to our earliest Cambrian rocks.

    I propose to carry out an investigation of this group for the purpose of

confirming Mr. Billings's and my own observations, by the examination of a

longer series of specimens than have hitherto been dealt with. In the mean
time the authenticity of the conclusions arnved at by Mr. Billings having
been called in question by Drs. Dana, Verrill, and Smith (see the American

Joum. of Science for May last, p. 320 ; Annals & Mag. Nat. Hist, for May,

 p. 366), I have carefully considered their objections, and have replied to

the same in the Geological Magazine for July last, p. 289, pi. 8 ; and I may

 be permitted here to briefly state the arguments p>-o and con, seeing they are

 of the greatest importance in settling the systematic position of the Trilo-

bita among the Crustacea.
    Until the discovery of the remains of ambulatory appendages by Mr. Bil-

 lings in an Asaphus from the Trenton Limestone (in 1870), the only appen-
 dage heretofore detected associated with any Trilobite was the hypostome or

 lip-plate.

    From its close agreement with the lip-plate in the recent Apus, and also
 from the fact of the number of body-rings exceeding that attained in any
 other group save in the Entomostraca, nearly all naturahsts who have paid

 attention to the Tiilobita in the past thirty years have concluded that they
 possessed only soft membranaceoiis giU-feet, similar to those of BrancMpus,
 Apiis, and other Phyllopods.

    The large compound sessile eyes, and the hard, shelly, many-segmented
 body, with its compound caudal and head-shield, diifer from any known

 PhyUopod, but offer many points of analogy with the modem Isopods J ; and

   * Anfkrapalamon Grossartii, Salter, Coal-measures, Glasgow,

   t Palminachus longipes, H. Woodw., Forest Marble, Wilts.
   J It should always, howerer, be borne in mind that as the Trilobita offer, as a group, no
fixed number of body-rings and frequently possess more than twenty-one segments, they

one would be led to presuppose the Trilobites possessed of organs of loco-
motion of a stronger texture than mere branchial frills.

    The objection raised by Drs. Dana and VerriU to the special case of ap-
pendages in the AsapJius assumed by Mr. Billings to possess ambulatory legs,

is that the said appendages were merely the semicalcified arches in the inte-
gument of the sternum to which the true appendages were attached.

   A comparison, which these gentlemen have themselves suggested, between

the abdomen of a Macruran Decapod and the TrUobite in question is the
best refutation of their own argument.

    The sternal arches in question are firmly united to each tergal piece at the
margin, not along the median ventral line. If, then, the supposed legs of the
Trilobite correspond to these semicalcified arches in the Macruran Decapod,
they might be expected to lie irregularly along the median line, but to unite
with the tergal pieces at the lateral border of each somite. In the fossil we
find just the contrary is the case ; for the organs in question occupy a definite
position on either side of a median line along the ventral surface, but diverge
widely from their corresponding tergal pieces at each lateral border, being
directed forward and outwards in a very similar position to that in which we

should expect legs {not sternal arches) to lie beneath the body-rings of a fos-

sil crustacean. The presence, however, of semicalcified sternal arches pre-
supposes the possession of stronger organs than mere foliaceous giU-feet

whilst the broad shield-shaped caudal lA&te suggests most strongly the posi-
tion of the branchiae. In the case of the Trenton Asaphus I shall be satis-

--fied if it appears, from the arguments I have put forward, that they are most

prohahly legs 'feeling assured that more evidence ought to be demanded be-
fore deciding on the systematic position of so large a group as the Trilobita
from only two specimens*.

    With regard to the embryology and development of the modern King-
Crab (Limulus polyphaimus), we must await the conclusions of Dr. Anton
Dohrn before deciding as to the affinities presented by its larval stages to

 certain of the Trilobita, such relations being only in general external form.
Dr. Packard (Reports of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science, August 1870) remarks, " The whole embryo bears a very near resem-
blance to certain genera of Trilobites, as TrinucJeus, Asaphus, and others ;"
and he adds, " Previous to hatching it strikingly resembles Trinucleus and
 other TrQobites, suggesting that the two groups, should, on embryonic and

structural grounds, be included in the same order, especially now that Mr. E.

 Billings has demonstrated that Asaphus possessed eight pairs of 5-jointed

 legs of uniform si^e."

    Such statements are apt to mislead unless we carefully compare the cha-
 racters of each group. And first let me express a caiition against the too

hasty construction of a classification based upon larval characters alone.
    Larval characters are useful guide-posts in defining great groups, and also in

indicating affinities between great groups ; but the more we become acquainted
with larval forms the greater will be our tendency (if we attempt to base our
classification on their study) to merge groups together which we had before

 held as distinct.

have, as a matter of course, been considered as belonging to a much lower group than the
Isopoda, in which the normal number of somites is seven. Wliilst admitting the justice of
this conclusion, we do not think it affords any good ground for rejecting the proposition
that the Isopoda may be the direct lineal descendants of the Trilobita.

56 REPORT 1871.

   To take a familiar iustance : if w^'compare the larval stages of the Com-
mon Shore-Crab {Carcinus 7noenas) with. Ptert/r/otus, we should be obliged
(according to the arguments of Dr. Packard) to place them near to or in the

same group.
   The eyes in both are sessile, the functions of locomotion, prehension, and

mastication are all performed by one set of appendages, which are attached
to the mouth ; the abdominal segments are natatory, but destitute of any

appendages.

   Such characters, however, are common to the larvae of many crustaceans
widely separated when adult, the fact being that in the larval stage we find
in this group what has been so often observed by naturahsts in other groups

of the animal kingdom, namely, a shadowing forth in the larval stages of
the road along which its ancestors travelled ere they arrived from the remote

past at the living present.

   If we place the characters of Limulus and Pterygotus side by side, and
also those of TrUobita and Isopoda, we shall find they may be, in the present

state of our knowledge, so retained in classification.

ON THE CENSUS.  57

Rej}0)'t of the Committee appointed at the Meeting of the British
    Association at Liverpool, 1870, consisting of Prof. Jevons, R.

   Dudley Baxter, J. T. Danson, James Heywood, F.R.S., Dr.

   W. B. Hodgson, and Prof. Waley, with Edmund Macrory as

   their Secretary, "for the purpose of urging upon Her Majesty's
    Government the expediency of arranging and tabulating the results

    of the approaching Census in the three several parts of the United

   Kingdom in such a manner as to admit of ready and effective

    comparison."

Your Committee after their appointment held meetings in London, and

agreed upon the following Memorial :

           " TJnifoemitt of Plan for the Census of the United Kingdom.

   "To the Right Honourable Henry Austin Bruce, M.P., &c. &c., Her Ma-
         jesty's Princi]3al Secretary of State for the Home Department.

    " Memorial of the Committee of the British Association, appointed in Liver-

          pool, September 1870, for the purpose of urging upon Her Majesty's
           Government the expediency of arranging and tabulating the results

            of the approaching Census in the three several parts of the United

           Kingdom in such a manner as to admit of ready and effectual com-

              parison.

    " Your memorialists beg respectfully to represent that the value of statistical
information depends mainly upon the accuracy and expedition with which
comparisons can be made between facts relating to different districts.

    "They also consider that the ease and rapidity with which researches in the
census tables can be made is one principal object to be held in view in de-
termining the form of their publication. They therefore desire that not

only should the enumeration of the jjeople be conducted in all places in an
exactly uniform manner, so far as is compatible with the terms of the
several Census Acts, biit that there should be no divergence in the modes of

tabulating and printing the results. They wish that the tables for England,
Scotland, and Ireland should form as nearly as possible one uniform and

 consistent whole.

    " Your memorialists could specify a great many points in which there was

divergence between the tables for 1861, but they will mention only a few
 of the more important cases.

    " 1. The detailed population tables of England, Scotland, and Ireland differ
 as regards the periods of age specified. The Scotch report gives twenty-one
intervals of age, the Irish report generally twenty-two, and the English
 only thirteen. Either one-third of the printed matter in the Scotch and

 Irish tables is superfluous, or that in the English tables deficient.

    " 2. The classification of occupations is apparently identical in the three
 reports, but there is much real discrepancy between the Irish and English

 reports, rendering exact comparison difficult.
     "3. In the Irish report there is no comparison and classification of occupa-

 tions according to age, classification according to religions being substituted,

 although such a classification could not be made in England or Scotland.
     " 4. In the appendix to the English report appears a table (No. 56), giving
58 REPORT 1871.

most important information as regards the numbers of the population at
each year of age. Inconvenience has been felt from the want of similar in-
formation concerning the populations of Scotland and Ireland.

    " 5. In the appendix to the Irish report they find some interesting Tables
(II., III., and IV.), to which there is nothing exactly corresponding in the
other reports, so far as they have been able to discover.

   " 6. The tables, even when containing the same information, are often

stated in different forms and arrangements, seriously increasing the labour

of research.

   " Your memorialists therefore beg to suggest :
       " I. That the principal body of tables relating to the numbers, age, sex,
               birthplace, civil condition, and occupation of the people should be
              drawn up and printed in an exactly identical form for the three
               parts of the United Kingdom.
      " II. That while the Commissioners may with great advantage continue
               to exercise their free discretion in drawing up such minor tables

                as appear to have si)ecial interest for distinct localities, they should

             agree to prepare in a uniform manner such minor or summary
             tables as may be of importance as regards aU the parts of the
               United Kingdom.

       " III. That a general Index of Subjects should be prepared for the whole
               of the reports, appendices, and tables, so that an inquirer can readily
               ascertain where the corresponding information for different parts
             of the United Kingdom is to be found, without making, as hitherto,
              three independent searches through a mass of comjjlex and
               almost unindexed information.

    " It would appear that the officers engaged in superintending the Census of
1861 acted to a certain extent in concert and agreement.

   " Your memorialists beg respectfully to request that those officers be in-
structed, on the present occasion, to confer with each other prior to drawing
up the tables for 1871, with a view of preserving perfect uniformity in their
operations, and avoiding all such divergencies in the three reports as are not
required by the Census Acts or the essential differences of the three
Kingdoms.

ON ABSTRACTS OF CHEMICAL PAPERS.  59

   The returns of the Census having only recently been collected, too little
time has as yet elapsed for the perfect arrangements of the tables to be
completed, but your Committee have reason to believe that the recommenda-
tions contained in the above memorial wUl ultimately be, to a considerable
extent, adopted by Her Majesty's Government.

  --Postscript. Since the above Report was drawn up, the Committee have

received a formal reply from the Home Office (dated 26th September, 1871),
informing them that the Home Secretary " has desired the Registrar General

for Scotland, and has requested the Lord Lieutenant to desire the Census
Commissioners in Ireland, to frame their tables in conformity with those
submitted by the Registrar General for England and Wales, and approved
by Mr. Bruce, as far as circumstances will admit ; and that with this view
he has instructed the above-mentioned officers to place themselves in com-
munication with the Registrar General for England and Wales."

Report of the Committee appointed for the purpose of Superintending

   consists o/Prof. A. W. Williamson, F.R.S., Prof. H. E. Roscoe,

   F.R.S., Prof. E. Fkankland, F.R.S.

The Committee are glad to be able to announce that regular monthly re-

ports of the progress of Chemistry have been published since April 1st, 1871,
by the Chemical Society. These Repoits have been rendered, as far as pos-
sible, complete by abstracts, more or less full, of all papers of scientific in-
terest, and of the more important papers relating to applied chemistry. The

abstracts have been made by chemists, most of whom are members of the

Societj% whose zeal for the science has induced them to undertake the work

Afor the small honorarium which the Council has been able to offer.

numerous Committee of Publication has been formed, whose Members gra-
tuitously undertake the revision of the proofs and a comparison of the ab-

stracts with the original papers.
   The Reports are edited by Mr. Watts, each monthly part being bound up

with the corresponding number of the Chemical Society's Journal. Each
volume wiU be furnished with a full index, and will give a complete view of

the progress of Chemistry during the year.
   The Committee feel that their thanks are due to aU those gentlemen en-

gaged in the work for having already so far succeeded in accomplishing a
task of such difficulty and importance, and they confidently hope that their
continued exertions wiU still further perfect the details of the scheme so as

gradually to increase the usefulness of the Reports.
    It is right to state that the funds of the Chemical Society available for

the purpose of the Reports, although so opportunely aided by a grant of
£100 from the British Association, were insufficient to defray the necessary
expenses, and that voluntary contributions to the amount of upwards of
60 REPORT 1871.

^200 have been received towards the cost of publication for the first year,
up to April 1872.

    There is good reason to believe that the expectations entertained of the
usefulness of these Reports will be fully realized by their continuance on the
present system, and that they wiU be found largely to conduce to the pro-
gress of the science wherever the English language is spoken.

Report of the Committee for discussing Observations of Lunar Objects

   suspected of Change. The Committee consists of the Rev. T. W.
   Webb and Edward Crossley, Seci'etary.

The Committee have much pleasure in presenting their first Eeport on the
above subject. Though much attention has been given of late years to a
large number of lunar objects, your Committee felt that they could not

accomplish their purpose better than by confining their Report to the discus-

sion of a limited and weU-observed portion of the lunar surface. No person

seeking to discover evidence of geologic change would be constantly travel-
ling over the whole surface of our globe, but would of necessity confine his
attention to a small area for a considerable period of time. This has been
the course adopted on the moon. Plato, a vast crater, containing 2700
square miles, in 51° N. lat. and 10° E. long., has presented a most interest-

ing and important variety of features, which we have endeavoured to photo-

graph, so to speak, with pen and pencil, with a view, if not at once to obtain
our iiltimate object, at least to lay out the groundwork for future observers.

   The Report has been carefully drawn up by Mr. "W. R. Birt on behalf of
the Committee. Time has only permitted the discussion of the observations
of the bright spots and craterlets seen on the floor of Plato ; whereas your
Committee consider that it is equally important that the observations of the
Humerous streaks, with the faults and other peculiar features noticed on the
floor and walls of this fine formation, should be likevdse discussed, in order
that something like a complete description of this object as observed at the
present time may be presented to the Association for the use of future sele-

nographers.

   Your Committee would therefore request that a further grant of £20 may

be placed at their disposal for this purpose during the ensuing year.

      Report on the Discussion of Observations of SjJOts on the Surface of the

                         Lunar Crater Plato. By W. R. Birt.

   In executing the task confided to me of discussing certain observations of

the spots on the lunar crater Plato, one of the first points which I deemed
it important to ascertain was the eifect which the intensity of the sun's
light as a function of his altitude might produce on the visibility of the spots.
The number of spots actually observed between April 18G9 and April 1871
inclusive, amounted to 37, the greater portion (21) having been discovered in
this interval. In order to become acquainted with phenomena possibly con-
nected with an increase of light on the floor of the crater, the observations
have been arranged under intervals of twelve hours, from suni-ise to sunset
on Plato, and a ledger formed for each interval, the number of which

is 31. Erom these ledgers the restdts in Table II. have been deduced,
viz. the mean number of spots visible during each interval, and the actual
number of spots observed during each interval. For illustrating the results

interval, from 6 observations.

Sixth maximum. Interval 24. 1870, Sept. 14, 16 spots, 23 for the whole

interval, from 3 observations.

When we take the mean numbers of spots seen at each intcn^al, the curve

is comparatively flat, rising but little above the mean line of 7-9 spots
visible at any interval, and this is about the mean number visible on any
evening. The flatness of the curve is not accordant with an increase of

spots dependent on an increase of solar altitude or greater angle of illu-

mination, otherwise the apex would be much more decided. We may, how-

ever, trace from the number of spots actually seen and contributing to
the maxima of the spot-curve, as weU as from the observations adduced

above, that the change of iUuminating angle does exercise an influence on
the appearance of spots, inasmuch as on a few occasions the largest number

of spots have been seen with higher illuminations. The actual curve, how-

ever, derived from two years' obsei-vations is not sufficiently decided to refer
the appearances of the spots to this agency.

By dividing the whole of the twelve hourly intervals into six series or

groups, and taking spot No. 1 as the standard of comparison, we have the

data for computing Tables III. and IV. containing the visibilities of each

spot for each group of intervals : sunrise, or to 60 hours, altitudes 0° to 17°

60 to 120 hours, altitudes 15°                                                                                       to  34°                    120 hours  to meridian passage, alti-
                                                                                                                                             ;

tudes 31° to 42°; meridian passage to 120 hours, altitudes 42° to 31°; 120 to

60 hours, altitudes 34° to 15°; and 60 to hours, or sunset, altitudes 17° to 0°.

From the results in these Tables, Table V. has been formed, in which we

have a bird's-eye view of the visibilities during the luni-solar day. Gene-

rally the visibilities are low during the first 60 hours, i. e. compared with

spot No. 1, the smaller spots are but seldom seen ; and this is so far indica-

tive of solar light in some way developing or bringing the spots into visi-

bility. During the next 60 hours some spots have risen considerably in

visibUity, while others have been seen more frequently during the afternoon

hours of the luni-solar day. The numbers are, however, too irregular to

allow us to conclude that the smaller and less frequently seen spots are in-

fluenced in their visibility by further changes of illuminating angle beyond

theii- first development                                                                                             and this is very strikingly manifested by the curves
                                                                                                                  ;

which these numbers furnish ; for example, the diurnal curves of spots

Nos. 5, 14, and 16 in fig. 2 generally agree in exhibiting greater visibilities

from 60 hours to meridian passage, while spots Nos. 9 and 11 are more

frequently seen from 120 to 60 hours before sunset. These, as well as the

peciiliarities of the other curves, strongly suggest that the variations of visi-

bility of certain spots are not to any great extent dependent upon an increase

of intensity of solar light, but rather upon some agency more particularly

connected with the spots themselves. It is important to remark that another

series of observations 7nay furnish totally diflferent diurnal curves, should

the variations in visibility depend upon local lunar action.
64 REPORT 1871.

   In nearly every case the spots seen during the first 60 hours of the luni-

solar day have increased durmg the day in visibility, i. e. they were seen less

                                        frequently during this group of

                                        intervals than during the succeed-

                                        ing sixty hours. This increase,

                                        however, has not been regular,

                                        which it would have been from

                                        changes of illuminating angle

                                        alone, some spots having been

                                        seen, as before stated, more fre-

                               Plato.   portant conclusion may be drawn,

                                        viz. that upon assuming other agen-

                                        cies to be in operation than changes

of illuminating angle, such as present activity, the epochs at which such

activity was manifested varied to such an extent, and were so far separated

from each other in time, as to coincide, in the case of spots Nos. 14, 5, and 16,
with the period in the luni-solar day of 60 to 120 hours after sunrise, while

the activity manifested by spots Nos. 9, 11, and 22 occurred at a later period
of the luni-solar day, 120 to 60 hours before sunset. So far as the varia-

tions of visibility of spots Nos. 14, 5, 16, 9, 11, and 22 are concerned,

they do not appear to depend exclusively on changes of illuminating angle,

even if a certain intensity of solar light contributes generally to render the

spots visible.

While the four craterlets Nos. 1, 3, 30, and 17 are visible during the whole

of the luni-solar day, the spots on their sites are seldom seen until the sun
attains an altitude of about 30°, and then they appear as " bright round

disks ;" and this characteristic attaches as well to the craterlets as to other

spots when the sun attains this altitude. With altitudes between 30° and
40° a different class of phenomena is manifested ; the sharp and distinct cha-

 cliangc takes place is as yet undetermined ; but there can be no question
 tliat it is of the same nature as that of the appearance of the spots on Plato
 greatly intensified.

    The result of the discussion may be briefly stated as being very strongly

 suggestive of the existence of present lunar activity, the exact nature of
 which requires further aud more extensive observations to determine. In-
 timately connected with the spot-changes are the variations of appearance
 and intensity of reflective power of the streaks and markings on the floor of
 Plato. In the obsei-vers' and other notes which form the Appendix to this
 Report will be found allusions to the connexion between the spots and streaks
 but it manifestly requires a similar discussion of the streaks and markings to
 arrive at a definite conclusion on the subject. Most of the observers have
 furnished observations of these interesting phenomena, so that a discussion

 of them could at once be proceeded with if it should be the pleasure of the
 Association to carry on the inquiry. The principal results of the discussion

 of the spot-observations relative to visibility, irrespective of solar altitudes,

and treated in pairs of lunations from April 1869 to November 1870, based

on 1594 observations during 20 lunations, are contained in Lunar Map Cir-

cular VIII. ; and some further remarks occur in a paper on the subject,
published in the Philosophical Magazine, March 1871. This discussion, on
an entirely difl'erent principle to that employed in the preparation of the
present Report, and leading to a similar result, tends to confer on both a

character in which confidence may be placed, for either without the other is

incomplete ; together they point to present lunar action as the originating
agency producing the phenomena.

   Although measurements for position of such delicate objects as the spots
on Plato are difiicult to execute, Mr. Gledhill has succeeded in obtaining
three sets of micrometrical measures, on September 13 and December 9,

1870, and on May 1, 1871, a combination of which has enabled me to draw

the outline of the crater, and to insert from these measurements four streaks
and the sector as seen generally by Mr. Gledhill. The streaks are ^, e, a,
and /3. The streaks ^ and e are rather westward of their places as given on

the tinted plate in the 'Student' of April 1870,. p. 161. The spots whose
positions have been determined by measures are Nos, 1, 4, 3, and 17. The
effect of the measures is to bring them eloser together and more towards the
centre of the crater than in the printed plans. On each occasion that the

measures were made, a diameter of the crater passing through spots Nos. 1

Aand 4, from to B, was measured, also one at right angles to this from C

to D, passing through N"o. 1. All the remaining measures of spots and

streaks were referred to these diamet6;rs, spot No. 1 being the origin of

the coordinates, and the longest diameter being considered as unity. The
ratios of the means of the measvu'es were determined to be as follows :

breaks in the S. and N. borders passed throngh the western ends of the

earliest streaks of light thrown on the floor. This line appears to be coinci-

--dent with the great fanlt crossing Plato. With reference to this I have the

following note : " This phenomenon, the western extremities of the streaks

falling in a line with the breaks in the N. and S. borders, was well observed

in January 1870. An elevation of the gronnd in the direction of this fault

has been seen. It would, however, appear that diiferences in the lengths of

the streaks would depend not on any unevenness of the ground, but on the

relative depths of the gaps in the W. border."

This was by far the finest observation of sunrise on Plato by no less than

seven observers, viz. Messrs. Gledhill, Pratt, Elger, Neison, Birmingham,

Joynson, and liirt. Mr. GledhiU's rccoi'd is so full and so interesting that

a reproduction of it will convey a vivid impression of the progress of iUu-

minatiou of a lunar formation as the sun rises upon it.

Jan. 10, 2\ Cloudless. Terminator just on the E. border of Plato; can

just see the outline of the crater, which now lies in deep shadow. On the

E. side the lofty steep wall just jS". of a triangular formation marked II E'/'^

glowed intensely in the solar rays.

'3^. The E. waU from the great breaks in the S. and N. borders appeared

as a bright narrow band. The curved outline of the N.E. border was bright,

sharp, and narrow, but the lower slope within could not be seen. I could

fancy that the W. part of the floor is, if possible, deeper in shadow than the

E. half. [This phenomenon has often been witnessed, and has been attri-

buted to the reflection of the strong light of the eastern interior from the

dark floor. Upon attentively contemplating this degradation of shadow near

its eastern boundary, it will often be seen that it is not simply a reflection

from the floor, but apparently the illumination of a something above the

floor.--W. E. B.]

gh ^5m_ ^ bright narrow broken line was seen between the two breaks on

&^the £. and N.E. The outline of II                                                                                                                                              is not yet visible.

4" 18". At this moment (12 hours 18 minutes after epoch) the first streak

of light fell upon the floor. Within it and near its western extremity was

seen No. 3 as two elevated objects, very near each other, but quite distinct.

I could not detect shadow between them after hard gazing, although it was

easily seen to the N.E. of the lower object. The sti-eak was three times the

breadth of the two objects together where it enclosed them, and it became

broader near the N.E. border of Plato ; it was brightest about and to the
west of No. 3, and inclined a little downwards at the E. end. * * * The

two components of No. 3 are of the same size apparently, are equally but

not very bright ; they lie nearly E. and W. of each other, but the E. com-

ponent is a very little to the N. of the other.

   ^h gQm_ rpj^g streak widens. I could not detect motion in it. I now care-

fully placed the wire on the great gap in the west border ; the line passed

along the axis of the streak. The west angle of the streak is not sharp, but

rounded, and lies a little beyond No. 3. The lower of the cones of No. 3

touches the lower edge of the streak. It now assumed a fan shape, being

broadest at the E. end, which is now more than halfway to the E. border.
   411 4Qni_ rpj^g streak is now much wider. I think I see a minute elevation

a little to the E. of No. 3 and in the streak. The two components of No. 3

are now bright and sharp, with shadow on the east. Another streak has

been barely visible or suspected for a few minutes; it lies to the S. of the
      OBSERVATIONS OF LUNAR OBJECTS.                                                                                                       69

former and near the S. border. It runs parallel with the noi-thern streak,

is about lialf its length, and has its western extremity over a point a httle

AE. of ]SI"o. 3. It is narrow, and extremely faint and difficult.                                        minute or

two later it was seen better, also a still fainter and narrower line to the

north of it, which is parallel with it and the northern streak. The most

southern streak produced to the E. would graze the southern edge of II E-As.

  4" 50"". Now the shadows from the W. wall take shape. The south sha-

dow, which extends up to the S. border, goes directly into the gap at the S.
edge of II &'\ The next pointed shadow to the N. of this goes direct to

the middle of II E'/'2 ; it is extremely pointed at its E. end for more than

half its length, and is suddenly wider at the W. end. [This appears to indi-

cate that the peak which throws the shadow is very needle-like.] I cannot

be quite sure that this shadow for the next lO" or 15TM really extended up

to the E. border. It became so faint and narrow and line-like that it could

not be well seen near the border. Then, again, the floor for some distance

(say a distance equal to the width of II &-) lay in rather dark shadow.

The floor between the shadows was not bright up to the E. border of Plato
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

all along the foot of the E. slope a dark shadow lay, and this interfered with

an exact determination of extremities of shorter shadows from the W. wall.

The next shadow to the north was a broad paraUel-sided belt, which pro-

ceeded to the E. border as such. Its upper or S. edge extended to the N.

end of II E'A2^ and its lower or N. edge cut the border of Plato just below, or

Ato the north of II E'/'2.                                                              line through No. 3 to the gap in the S.E. border

cuts the W. angles of the two southern bright spaces between the shadows.

   5^. No. 3 lies on the lower edge of the lowest bright space or upper edge

of the lowest shadow. The shadow still clings to or is in contact with No. 3,
and either extends to the E. of it, or No. 3 throws a shadow to the E. The

floor along the E. border is stiU dusky ; it is brightest at that part in Une

with No. 3,

  A5" 5TM. very fine narrow shadow is now seen to stand off from the sha-

dow below and in contact with No. 3 ; it is this which touches No. 3.

   5" IS". The upper shadow is now clearly pointed, and falls short of the

border. [This is probably the shadow of the peak between B. & M.'s y and
^.] I still see a minute elevation just to the N.E. of No. 3. It is now just

on the tip of the lowest pointed shadow, and about halfway from 3 to the

N.E. border. [This spot is No. 32 ; it was discovered in streak B by Mr
Elger on December 15, 1869.--W. E. P.]

5" 45TM. Floor at the foot of the E. border is still dark, except at the ex-

treme N. The long broad shadow is now retiring from the E. border, and is

seen  faintly bifui'cated                                                               the  lowest  or  northern fork is the longer, but  this
                                                                                     ;

broad shadow stUl seems to have its N. and S. edges parallel.

6". Now the dark shadow on the S. border breaks up, and a fine pointed

shadow separates from its northern side, which if produced goes quite into
&Kthe gap at the southern edge of II
                                                                                                         The bright W. angle above this

shadow goes back towards the W. until under the great gap in the S. border.

The great central shadow is now easily seen bifurcated ; the lower peak is

the longest, and reaches nearly up to the east border. The tip of the shorter

shadow to the N. reaches just to No. 3 ; the next to the N. is rather lono-er

Now0" 20TM. The object to the N.E. of 3 (32) is easy, elevated, and bright.

4 is seen, also a large elevated object (7) about halfway from it to the N.

extremity of II E'A^, and on this hne.

end of II E'/'2. The E. portion of the floor for some distance from the foot

of the slope is still dusky. The shadow of the N.E. component of No. 3 is

Aeasy, and lies to the N^.E.  line from the lower edge of the shadow in the

great gap of the west border along the lower edge of the central shadow

goes into the gap at the N. end of II E'l'^. This shadow is now finely bifur-

cated ; the lower or northern peak is the longer.

   8'\ Spot No. 1 is now seen as a large striking object. It seems to be in

the path of the upper fork of the central shadow, and looks like the shadow

of one of Jupiter's satellites on the disk. [In Mr. Birmingham's sketch of
©--May 19, 1869,
                  S8 =286° 37'-3, the upper or southern fork of the central

shadow is longest, while in the present series of observations the northern is

the longest. This is not a solitary instance of variation in the shadow of this

peak. Mr. Birmingham is in agreement with Mr. GledhiU in referring spot

No. 1 to the upper or southern fork. In my paper on the spots and shadows

of Plato (Transactions of Sections, p. 17, ' Report of British Association for

the Advancement of Science,' 1869), I remark that Rosse and Birmingham

have drawn No. 1 with the shadow of Z just receding from it. ChaUis's

shadow of h terminates by a straight line ; neither fork was visible, for he

carefully measured the two angular points. Rosse di'ew the termination of

the shadow as from two pinnacles upon the summit, with No. 1 between

them. These variations are doubtless azimuthal ; nevertheless they are of

great importance, as we hoi^e presently to show.]

8*^ 5'". Spot No. 1 is a large, lofty, very prominent cone. Close to the N.E.

component of No. 3, and to the N.E. of it, is seen a black shadow curved to

the N.E., with a bright elevated object close to the curve. I see the two

components of No. 3 as bright distinct objects ; then, close to the N.E. foot

of the N.E. component, comes a large circular shadow quite black, embracing

a bright object to the N.E.

   8*^ 15TM. Spot No 4 is already getting rather difficult and hazy, although it

lies far away in the bright eastern floor. Spot No. 17 is now seen just ou

the lower edge of the uppermost pointed shadow. No. 1 is bright aud large,

free from the long shadow. Shadow still lies on the eastern floor at the foot

of the slope. Mr. Pratt, the same evening, Jan. 10, noticed a peculiar feature

of the eastern part of the floor corroborative of Mr. Gledhill's observation of

Athe dip to the foot of the east border. He says, " peculiar feature of the

eastern part of the floor in sunhght observed. Between what was probably

the eastern margin of the sector h and the foot of the interior slope of the

E. rim was a decidedly darker tint, as if that part of the floor was lower

than the rest, and perhaps falling towards the border ; the western margin

followed very closely the form it would have if the whole space between the

sector b and the border were depressed." In my own record, Jan. 10, 4*^ 48"',

--the Crossley equatorial 7"3-in. aperture, eye-piece No. 4, power 122, with

slot, I say : " The S. spire of sunlight apparent ; it is directed towards the

middle of II E'''^. Neither of the spires of light reach the border, indicating

the floor to dip near the border."
   Mr. GledhiU summarizes his observations, under the head of " points de-

termined," as follows :

First. The position, size, alignment, and order of development of tlic

streaks [of sunlight, as distinguished from those that make their aj^pear-

ance afterwards] which first fall on the floor. They are evidently the solar

rays passing through the gaps on the border.

Second. The floor on the E. at the foot of the inner slope lies in shadow

more or less deep until the giant shadows from the W. border have retreated

westward beyond the centre of the crater.

Third. That spots I^os. 1, 3, 17, the object halfway between No. 4 and

+the E. border (7), the object halfway  between No. 3 and the E. border

(32), the object (if any) just to the E. of No. 3 (31), and the object S.W. of

No. 1 at a considerable distance away are all elevated objects.

[Some time subsequently to these observations I received from Mr. Gled-

hill a drawing of nine crater cones seen on Jan. 10, 1870. They were Nos.

1, 3, 30, 4, 7, 9, 11, 17, and 32. I have not received any conhrmation of

the object a considerable distance S.W. of No. 1.--W. E. B.]

Fourth. The order in time of the apjiearance of the shadows.

Fifth. The time to a minute when light first falls on the floor.

[The discussion of the observations by intervals shows that the sun's light

first falls upon the floor of Plato from ten to thirteen hours after the sun has

risen at 4° &-1 of E. long, on the equator according to season ; a simple

© --computation of the epoch of sunrise at this longitude and    S3 will be a

guide to ascertain the illumination of Plato within twenty-four hours of the

epoch.--W. E. B.]

Sixth. The interval between the appearance of light on the floor and the

distinct perception of the shadows from the W. border is about twenty-five

or thirty minutes.

Seventh. The great northern streak of sunlight is seen some fifteen minutes

before the southern streaks are detected. This may be caused either by dif-

ference in elevation of the gaps in the W. border, or diff'ercnce in level of the
floor, or both may unite to produce the effect.

AVhat can cause the duskiness of the eastern floor except depression of the floor ?

1870, Jan. 10, 9" 0°. Mr. Elger saw spot No. 1 close to the shadow of the

peak situated on the S. of the great gorge or opening in the W. wall. At

9'' 10"' the N. peak of this shadow was about clearing it ; at the same time

spot No. 4 could just be seen. Mr. Elger remarked that the shading round

spot No. 1 was much darker than the central portion of the floor, and that

this dark shading could be traced in an easterly direction to about one fourth

of the distance between the spots 1 and 4: " this," says Mr. Elger, " would

appear to indicate a fall in the surface of the floor from No. 1 towards

the E. in section" (fig. 5). Schroter, if I re-                 p- g

member rightly, alludes to some observations indi-

cating similar irregularities in the floor. Erom

Mr. Elger's observation, combined with one of Mr.

Gledhm's to be noticed under Feb. 9, 1870, it would

appear that spot No. 1 is situated on the ridge marking the great fault. (See

the floor. Is there reliable evidence that the N.E. and S.E. areas of the

floor are lower near their respective borders than towards the spotless central

area ? In January last I saw spot No. 1 in contiguity with the shadow of

No. 2 peak (western wall) ; the surface of the floor east of No. 1 was then,

of course, seen under very oblique light. Judging from the shading and

general aspect of the surface in the neighbourhood of No. 1, there appeared

to be a veri/ rapid fall from spot No. 1 to spot No. 4 ; if this bo so, the

stem of the ' trident ' would be a depression in the surface."

equator, E. loug., Mr. Elger records spots Nos. 1 and 17 in contiguity with

shadows of high peaks on west wall [y and ^] : Nos. 1, 3, 4 very plain [seen
also by Mr. Pratt], 17 faint, 25 only glimpsed, 7 suspected; no markings

seen. Mr. Pratt records on same day shadows of y, ?, and e on floor nearly

similar to 1809, Nov. 12, excepting that S showed a second point south of

chief one, and that of e did not exhibit a cleft.

The importance of such careful observations as those which have furnished

the data for this interval cannot admit of question. The determination of

the epoch at which the floor first becomes illuminated, as compared with the

epoch of an easily computed phenomenon (sunrise at a given longitude on

the equator), places at once within our reach the means of ascertaining when

the appearances witnessed during the interval 10 to 24 hours after sunrise,

at 4° E. long, on the equator, 'rtU be repeated*. This is, however, a small

result  compared with the forms  and progressions of the  shadows                                              for by their

aid, especially if well sketched, and their lengths carefully measured, or even

estimated in parts of those of the three measured peaks y, I, and c, the dis-
tance of the west wall from the terminator being at the same time ascer-

tained, the irregularities of the west wall at sunrise, and by a similar process

those of the cast wall at sunset, may be obtained with tolerable precision by

13. & M.'s method described in ' Der Mond,' § 65, p. 98, and in the Keport

of the Lunar Committee of the British Association, ' Eeport,' 1867, p. 15.

We have thus the power, by multiplying such observations, of becoming inti-

mately acquainted with the breaks and gaps, the elevations and towering

pinnacles of the wall, and are in a position for handing down to our suc-

cessors details that may enable them to detect changes, if such should occur,

of sufficient magnitude to become perceptible. The shadows which I enu-

--merated on Jan. 10, 1870, were six, the longest y, one between y and ?,

I with its two peaks or saddle form, one south of e, and e. Mr. Joynson, of

Liverpool, gives in his drawing of the same date two peaks to ^. The irre-

gularities both of the floor and border have come out by these observations

with marked distinctness, and tend greatly to settle for the present epoch

the main features. If, however, changes are in progress, they may be, as on

the earth, extremely slow.

   The appearances recorded on January 10, 1870, being so different to that

witnessed by Bianchini, August 16, 1725, the following translation, by my

friend Mr. Kuott, from Bianchini's work ' Hesperi et Phosphori Nova Phe-

nomena' (Eomae, 1728), wUl doubtless be read with interest:

   " Under the auspices of the Cardinal de Polignac, two large telescopes, 94

and 150 Boman palms long, by Campini, were prepared and erected, and on

the 16th of xlugust, 1725, the following observations of Plato were made.

   " Although on that night we were only able to turn the telescope 150

palms long, on the moon we detected, in the lunar spot named Plato, a

phenomenon not previously observed. The moon was at the time a little

past its first quadrature with the sun, which it had attained on the previous

day, and the spot Plato fell on the periphery of solar illumination, where is

the boundary of light and darkness in the lunar hemisphere exposed to the

sun. The whole of the very elevated margin, which on all sides surrounds

the spot like a deep pit, appeared bathed in the white rays of the sun. The

bottom of the spot, on the other hand, was stUl in darkness, the solar light

not yet reaching it ; but a track of ruddy light, like a beam, crossed the

middle of the obscure area, stretching straight across it from one extremity

to the other, with much the same appearance as in winter in a closed cham-
ber the sun's rays admitted through a window are wont to present, or as
they are seen in the distance when cast through openings in the clouds, or

like comets' tails at night in a clear sky stretched out at length in space, as

we remember to have seen in the one which in the years 1680 and 1681 was
80 conspicuous to all Europe. This appearance, never before seen by me in

this or any other lunar spot, is represented in the figure which I give below.

   " 1, 2. The lunar spot named Plato, and the ruddy ray of the sun thrown
across its dark floor from the margin of the spot 1, white aiid turned towards
the sun. It was thus observed at Rome on the Palatine Mount, Aug. 16,

1725, at 1| hour after sunset, with the 150-palm telescope of J. Campini.
    " It is proposed to astronomers and physicists, for their consideration and

judgment, whether this is to be taken as an indication of an aperture piercing
the border of the spot which is turned towards the sun, through which opening
the rays are cast and appear as through a window ; or whether it is rather to be
thought that they are refracted rays, which are bent from the top of the border
towards the bottom, and appear of a ruddy tint as they are wont to do in our

own atmosphere at sunrise and sunset, and so give reason for admitting the ex-
istence of some denser fluid like an atmosphere surrounding the lunar globe."

    I have the following remarks on the above, dated June 4, 1867 :

   " Bianchini appears to have been one of the earliest observers who noticed

' detail ' more jiarticularly. Hevel, lliccioli, Cassini, and others aimed more
at delineating the entire surface, which of course included much detail that
is becoming more and more valuable every day ; still such observations as
Bianchini's, recorded in his ' Hesperi et Phosphori,' are of great value, espe-
cially as the appearances described and delineated could not find place in a
more general work."

    Sclirciter, in his ' Selenotopographische Fragmente,' vol. i. p. 334, §§ 256,
257, refers to the observation of Bianchini, and also to one of Short's in 1751,
April 22. It would appear that Bianchini's suggestion of an aperture or hole

in the W. rim of Plato was not verified by Short, who seems to have observed
75) REPORT 1871.

the shadows of the three peaks y, I, and e &of 13. M., which are represented
by Schroter in t. xxi. The. shadows of these and other peaks on the W. waU

have been very frequently observed of late years.

I am not aware that liianchini's observation has been verified. The pecu-

liar ap2)earance which he has delineated depends not only on libration, but

also on the angle which the terminator makes with the meridian ; for it is

clear that the direction of the terminator must form a tangent to a line pass-

ing equally through the depression in the wall to produce the appearance

seen by Biauchini ; and it is highly probable that it is of very rare occur-

rence, as seen from the earth, the variation in the angle of terminator with

meridian being as much as 3°.

While transcribing the above (April 22, 1871) I have considered the Bian-

chini phenomenon more closely. During the year 1870 the opportimities

for observing sunrise on Plato were comparatively numerous, and certainly

not the slightest appearance of Bianchini's streak was detected ; on the other

hand, the positions of the earliest rays of sunlight on the floor have been

determined, with some degree of precision, for the portion of the luni-solar

year during the period of the observations. If the configiu'ation of the W.

wall is different now from what it was in Bianchini's time, the phenomenon

may be explained by the supposition that the gap or pass iS". of the peak h

was lower than at present, and has been raised \>y " landslips " on one or

both sides, which are of extensive occuiTence on the moon as recognized by

Nasmyth ; the absence of fui-ther observations by Biauchini on the same

evening, however, leaves the matter in doubt.

Short records, in the Phil. Trans, for 1751, p. 175, that on April 22,

1751, he saw a streak projected along the flat bottom of Plato. Soon after

he saw another streak parallel to the first, but somewhat lower [or northerly],

which in a very short time divided into two. He found a gap in the wall

opposite the first streak, and also one in the direction of the lower one.

Not only is Bianchini's observation at variance with modern observations,

but Short's also. The order of appearance of the streaks of sunlight on the

floor  on  Jan.  10,  1870,  is, first,  the  broad  streak  through  the  wide  gap
                                                                                                      ;

second, the southern streak north of the peak y. The appearances of Short's

streaks were in the reverse order.

The following record of observations by Schroter on July 30, 1789, at

O*" 48'", kindly translated by Mr. Gledhill, will illustrate Mr. Elger's obser-

vation on January 10, 1870 :

  A' Selenotopographische Fragmeute,' § 250, vol. i. p. 329. " difl^erent,

more beautiful, and more magnificent view of Plato is obtained when, with

the rising sun, the first traces of an extremely faint twilight are seen on the

grey fioor of the crater, and when the first beams of light are thrown over

the mountains into the plain below. This view of Plato, which lasts only

for a few minutes during the slow monthly rotation, and for which one may

wait for a year and yet not see it, I saw on the 30th of July, 1789, 9'' 48'".

As in the 8th figure of t. xxi., the terminator had advanced from W. to E. as

far as a, /3. To the W. of this the greatest part of the border lay in the

light of day [or on the day side], and only the small portion to the E. of a,

/3 was illuminated on the night side. The whole inner grey sin-face, on the
contrary, was still hidden by the shadows of the lofty mountains on the

border, and on the S. border there was also a low spot filled with shadow.

"Wliile I was observing the shadows of the inner surface with power 161, I

became aware of something to the E. of the middle of the floor, as if the dark

Asurface were in a kind of fermentation.             few seconds later I saw here in
OBSERVATIONS OF LUNAR OBJECTS.                                       75

two places an extremely distinct unveiling or brightening which closely re-

semhled a very faint tivilight. Both places appeared dark, blackish, and con-'
trasted so slightly with the other night-shadows, that at first I was uncertain

whether or not I perceived a real difference in the obscurity. Meanwhile,
after a few seconds both the liglit-spots became somewhat brighter, changed
their form continually, until they soon became larger and notably brighter,
and assumed the appearance given in fig. 8 ; and as no very marked change
occurred while the obsei'vation was being made, I was by this time able to

sketch them in their present clearer colour and increased size ; but even yet

they appeared a dark grey, so that, according to my arbitrary scale and a

very approximate estimation, they were placed at only ^°, or at most |°.
    " Doubtless these present but always very dark colours were half-shadows,

and were found there because in these two places only a part of the rising-

sun was visible over the irregular elevations on the western border; and

these half-shadows I have often seen in the course of my observations when

the terminator passes across grey surfaces. Soon after, the surface threw off

the mask of night, and in a few minutes I could distinguish the line-like
shadows lying across the whole floor thrown by the peaks on the western
wall. If one, however, compares the shape of these two somewhat bright
spots on the map with the position and shadows of the west border, and re-

flects that these bright spots, as I saw them, were surrounded by the shadows
of night on the east, there can no longer be any doubt (if a different reflec-

tion of the light has no share in the matter) that the floor is not perfectly
flat, but that these two places are somewhat more elevated ; and with this

sujjposition the observations given before quite agree."

   The following notes have been kindly furnished by Mr. Pratt, relative to

the foregoing description of sunrise :

   " Jan. 10, 3^. On 1870, March 10, 1 have notes of the same phenomenon,

which I believe I forwarded at the time, recording the inability I experienced

Myto rid myself of the idea that I was witnessing a true twilir/ht.  observa-

tion of it extended over twenty-five minutes, at the end of which time I

perceived the faintest trace of the formation of the spires."

    "Jan. 10, 4"^ 18"*, spot No. 3. Query. Is the brightest spot of the streak,
here mentioned as seen inclined to the north of No. 3, and I presume in close

proximity to it, my spot No. 30 ? As far as I can understand the localities

are identical."

   " Jan. 10, 4'' 50TM, shadow of peak y. On a similar occasion I have ob-

served the thin thread of the shadow lying across II EV'S, and have watched

it slowly shortening and travelling down the interior slope of the rim, and had

a good view of it lying on the floor just in contact with the foot of the slope."
   " Jan. 10, 8*", shadow of peak h. I do not remember to have ever seen

the shadow of d otherwise than with the northern fork the longest."

  --On Bianchini's light-streak Mr. Pratt remarks : " Bianchini's ruddy spire

of light, which he observed at Rome, 1725, Aug. 16, and thought to be sun-
light shining through an aperture in the west wall, would the want of

achromaticity in his 150-palm telescope account for the colour ? Still his

unique view may prove valuable some day ; and it is stimulating to perse-

verance on our part to multiply observations with our comparativelj^ luxu-

rious instruments to find such unwieldy telescopes capable of so much in the

hands of a careful observer. I wonder if the crater G on the west exterior

slope was recorded so long since, as its clean-ciit form, as I have sometimes

seen it, is suggestive of recent formation, and its localitj' such as to easily

account for the fiUing-up of the aperture Bianchini supposed."

[The crater G is not seen in Bianchini's drawing of 1725, August 16, nor

in that illustrating his observations of 1727, August 23 and September 22.

W. 11. B.]

Mr. Pratt remarks, that in Short's observation of 1751, April 22, the first

streak of sunlight was on the upper part of the floor, followed soon after by

a parallel streak somewhat lower. " It is important," says Mr. Pratt, " to

learn what  khid  of  telescope Short used during  the  observation                                                   for  as  he
                                                                                                                   ;

was chiefly a maker of the Gregorian form, and as that construction does not

invert the image, it may be possible his term hwei- may mean southerly in-

stead of northerly, thus being in accord with modem observations."

" The very interesting translation of Schroter's notes of 17b9, July 30, and

his discovery of something on the eastern half of floor, as if a kind of fer-

mentation was going on, and his discovery a few seconds later of an unveil-

ing or brightening, closely resembUng twihght, remind me," says Mr. Pratt,

" very forcibly of my own observations before mentioned. The half-shadows
of Schroter also remind me of what 1 have very often seen, as he describes

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

but 1 cannot understand his explanation of them. As far as I can see, half-

shadows presuppose an atmosphere ; and a well-authenticated course of ob-

servations of them would be good proof of the latter's presence."

[If by the term " half-shadow" be meant the penumbral fringe of every

true shadow, the rays of light emerging from opposite limbs of the sun,

crossing beyond the object casting the shadow and then diverging, will fully

explain such a fringe. In the case of the sun rising above the mountains,

the reverse phenomenon occurs, viz. a gradual darkening fiinge skirting the

illuminated surface arising from less and less Hght arriving from the sun's

disk ; a true twilight is occasioned by the particles of an atmos^jheric medium
being illuminated by the sun's rays whUe the luminary is below the horizon,

--and such I believe I have on several occasions witnessed. W. E. B.]

                                      Interval 24 to 36 hours.

   1870, May 9. Mr. Gledhill describes spot Xo. 1 as easy ; a fine sharp
crater, with raised walls, much black shadow within, the east inner slope

bright : he also records 3 and 1 7 as presenting the same appearance as

No. 1. On October 3, at about IS"" earlier illumination, Mr. Gledhill did not

observe the crater character of these objects, but describes them as elevated
objects. This is remarkable, as on Oct. 3 the moon's latitude was 1° to 2° S.,

whUe on May 9 it was 3° N., libration carrying Plato further from the eye,

yet the crater character was more distinct. Mr. Elger records No. 17 as seen
by ghmpses.

 --As regards spots 13 and 19, the following remarks of Mr. Elger are inter-

esting : '· The northern portion of the floor, including streak a, was noted
as equally hght ; the streak could not be traced." Mr. Gledhill writes, a not
to be distinguished from the bright floor all along the north border. Mr.
Elger found the same locahty " all light on the 10th."

   1870', February 9. Mr. Gledhill first saw spot No. 4, its bright W. Avail
only. He says, "This object seems to have loiver walls than 1, 17, or 3."

Mr. Gledhill writes : " For a few minutes I saw what appeared to be a very
low ridge running from N. to S. across the floor of Plato. It runs from the
N. border to spot 3, then curves to N^o. 1 , and again bends back to the E.
and reaches No. 17, and thence goes on to the S. border." [The low ridge
mentioned by Mr. Gledhill is, so far as I know, new. It is not coincident
with the great fault from N.W. to S.E. From a drawing subsequently sent

to me by Mr. Gledhill, it would indicate a fracture, having its origin at spot

No. 1, diverging N.E. and S.E. to spots Nos. 3 and 17, and extending from
them in opposite directions to the N. and S. horders.] At 5.30 Mr. Gledhill
recorded that spot No. 4 is already indistinct ; there is a dull yellow patch
about it. No. 3 at this early stage of illumination Mr. Gledhill found to be
single ; he looked in vain for the other two adjacent spots, Nos. 30 and 31.

    1870, Oct. 3. Mr. Gledhill records Nos. 1, 3, 17, and 30 as elevated ob-
jects. Mr. Elger found no trace of 3.

    1870, March 11, Mr, Gledhill describes spots Nos, 1 and 3 as bright, cir-

cular.

                                        Interval 36 to 48 hours.

    1870, April 10. Mr. Gledhill records spot No. 1 as a large, sharp, cir-

cular crater, with internal shadow on W. side ; also Nos. 3 and 17 as circular

craters. Mr. Elger records Nos. 16 and 25 as frequently glimpsed.
    1870, July 7. Mr. Whitley observed Nos. 1, 3, and 17 as craterlets, 4 a

white spot, and glimpsed No. 11 very faint. On the same evening Mr. Neison

recorded the floor as very dark, the spots indistinct, not visible continuously
and Mr. Elger could just trace the " sector."

    1870, Jan. 11, 7.20. Mr. Gledhill describes spot No. 1 as a large round
crater, larger than Linne, quite bright and circular, a very fine easy object.

At 7.30 the same evening, he says " Linne also is now seen as a crater, with

some shadow within on the west." At 7.45 Mr. Gledhill writes : " Now the

N.E. inner slopes of craters Nos. 1 and 3 glow in the bright sun, whUe the

S.W. inner slopes are in shadow. It is the N.E. inner slope which so often,
in bad definition, comes out as a bright disk or semidisk."

  --1869, August 16. Mr. Pratt thus >vrites : "Of these difficult objects

[the spots], seven were seen many times during the hour; No. 1 often well

defined as a crater, Nos. 3 and 4 as well-defined craters as No. 1, but accom-
panied with a nebulous light, perhaps caused by the companion spots to each,
which, however, were never clearly defined owing to the minuteness of the
objects and the short periods of definition clear enough. They both had a

 similar appearance."

    1870, September 4. Mr, Neison records No. 4 as just observable, and 14

 very faint.

                                         Interval 48 to 60 hours.

    1870, May 10. Mr. Gledhill records spots Nos. 1, 3, and 17 as elevated

 craters with little internal shadows. Mr. Elger records No. 5 as seen only

by glimpses much fainter than 17; 16 and 14 easy.
    1871, March 1. Mr. Gledhill records spot No. 1 as a crater brightest on

 the inner E. wall.

     1870, August 6. Mr. Elger noticed the west portion of the floor of an
 even light colour. It is on this portion that the spots Nos. 13, 19, and 22,

which have decreased of late in visibility, are situated. On the 24th of

 March, 1870, Mr. Gledhill observed the reverse, viz. the west part of the
 floor exhibited the darkest tint. It was, however, less in extent than the
 light portion given by Mr. Elger, and was seen under the opposite illumina-
 tion. See intervals 108"^ to 96", and 12" to 0" *.

     1870, October 4. Mr. Gledhill records No. 1 as an elevated object. Mr.
 Elger found No. 14 more easy than 5 and 17 ; it was not seen by Gledhill.
 Nos. 3, 30, and 17 were seen as bright disks by GledhUl.

   * These reversed tints are quite in accordance with the surface of the floor dipping on

each side from the line of " fault" crossing Plato from N.W. to S.E.

Mr. Elgcr records No. 5 as seen only by glimpses, but brighter than No. 1.

    18G9, August 17. Mr. Pratt inserted the positions of the spots observed

                                        Interval 72 to 84 hours.

    1870, April 11. Mr. Elger records No. 5 nearly as bright as 17, which
he regarded as fainter than at last lunation ; 14 and IG were easy, 24 and
25 seen by glimpses. Mr. Gledhill records Nos. 1, 3, 30, and 17 as bright
circular disks. Mr. Pratt detected the six spots which he observed with

difficulty.

   1870, March 13. Mr. Gledhill writes : " Unless I am very much mistaken

indeed, 34 was an easy object, i. e. No. 1 came out easUy ' double ; ' also, as

the E end of the floor slopes to the east, spots Nos. G and 7 may be seldom
seen on this account (?)." To this I add : "This may be the case while the moon
is passing from perigee to apogee." Mr. Gledhill says further : " No 3 (and

30) very easy, wide, double ; 3 is the larger, both equally bright : 30 is not

seen nearly so often as 3 ; when only one is seen it is 3."

    1870, June 9. Mr. Elgcr recorded 5 as brighter than 17.
    1870, February 11, 6.30. Mr. Gledhill found spots Nos. 1 and 17 as very
sharp bright disks, but could not detect interior shadows ; he describes Nos.
1, 17, and 3 as sparkling. Of No. 1, he says, it often comes out double;

last year I often saw it thus. I am now almost sure I see a minute object

close to the west of it (34).

                   --Interval 84 to 96 hours.

   1870, December 4. Mr. Elger writes : " The marking connecting the
middle and east arm of trident, which was, I believe, first seen by Mr.
Pratt last spring, I found a very easy object, fully as bright as the brightest
portions of the ' trident ; ' it follows the curvature of the south border, and
crossing the last arm of the trident, terminates about halfway between the

latter and the west limit of the ' sector.' During the May and June luna-
tions, I had faint glimpses of it ; but it was then a very much more difficult

object than it is now."

   The apparition of this streak appears in some way to be connected with

spot No. 5, the variations in -v-isibility of which are considerable. As, from
the discussion of visibility, the connexion of these variations with illumi-
nating, visual or atmospheric (terrestrial), changes appears to be untenable,

it maybe suggested that, if the first maximum, Aug.-Sept. 1869, resulted
from increased activity, ejecta may have been thrown out and jiroduced the

faint streak which was seen on the west of No. 5 by ttuo observers. At or

about the second epoch of increased activity, a larger quantity of ejecta

: * Mr. Gledhill has frequently observed spot No. 4 at the angle formed by the eon-
verging sides of the " sector."
OBSERVATIONS OF LUNAK OBJECTS.                                   79

may have boon thrown out, producing a brighter streak, extending eastward

as well as westward. The most interesting circumstance connected mth

this streak is its conformity in direction to that of the south border, as if

some peciiliarity of the surfece existed in the neighbourhood of No. 5, of a
depressed character, which received the outflow or outthrow of the ejecta.
Another noteworthy circumstance is, that this streak was not recorded

caiiier than May 13, 1870.

    1870, September 6. Mr. Gledhill records Nos. 1, 3, 17, and 30 as bright
disks, also that definition was good, and that the streaks and spots seemed to

stand out in rehef.

 --18G9, November 15. Mr. Gledhill writes : "The spots Nos. 1, 17, and 3 do

not appear as a mere white s^jof on the floor of Plato would do. There is a
sharpness and clearness of contour and a brightness (uniform) of surface
which could only belong to a crater or peak. I have often been struck with
this. This remark appHes to them whenever they are well seen. I can

only liken them to the small round disks of bright stars seen in the transit-
instrument. Spot No. 4 never looks like Nos. 1, 17, or 3." To this I append

--the following query : Do the clearness and sharpness of the contour of spots

Nos. 1, 17, and 3 result from seeing the shadowless interiors of the craterlets?
If so, on what agency does the appearance of the mere white spots depend ?

Do Nos. 1,17, and 3 vary in this respect with good states of our atmosphere ?
Mr. Pratt records a spot new to him on the N.W. of 3, about half as far from

3 as is 4 on the opposite side, and aligning with 3 and 4 ; he speaks of it as

exceedingly small. I have numbered it 29. He also observed spot No. 8,

which he describes as fainter than 29, and situated about one third the dis-

tance from 3 towards 4. On this evening Mr. Pratt very carefully scru-

--tinized No. 3 and its immediate neighbourhood ; the following are his notes

transmitted to rac : " First. The second spot, which I have always ob-

served with 3 (and which I learn from Mr. Birt I have always placed in the

same relative position as has Mr. Dawes, who discovered it, and of whose

alignment I was before quite unaware), is exceedingly close to 3 on the
N.E. I estimate the distance at 2", and its position with respect to 1 was
very carefully judged to be 145" to 150°, reckoning from S. round by E.,

which I afterwards found by comparison to be about the angle represented

Ain my former sketches. Second.  third spot, S.E. of 3, and twice as far

from it as Mr. Dawes's, was observed. Its relative size was judged to be

one fourth, while that of the second spot was one third of 3. The direction

was from 3 towards 4." [This spot I take to be 8.--W. E. B.]. "Another

lieculiarity in 3. was, that it was just included by the light streak, but still
(piite on its edge, as was also its smallest companion. I now determined

very carefully the colour of the immediate localities of cdJ spots visible. After

independently noting it for each spot, I found on summing up that the

whole were upon the light streaks, with the exception of No. 1, around and

towards which the light streak was softly shaded off."

1870, July 9. Mr. Whitley glimpsed spot No. 17 with difllculty.

                                       Interval 9G to 108 liours.

    1870, April 12. Mr. Gledhill records Nos. 1, 3, and 30 as bright circular
disks, 1 7 as a bright disk, also 6, but seen only once or twice. Mr. Pratt records
No. 1 as very dense and bright, 3 and 4 as hazy, and 16 and 22 difficult.

   1870, May 12. Mr. Gledhill records Nos. 1, 3, and 17 as fine bright disks,

No. 4 a spot, but seldom seen. Marking a, Mr. Gledhill records as the
brightest, and Mr. Elger mentions the part east of No. 16 as veiy bright

and well defined ; this, as well as the remarks of Mr. Elger on May 9, may

tend to throw some light on the decreased visibility of Nos. 13 and 19 (see

Interval 24 to 36 hours). On this evening Mr. Whitley observed and described

the markings, giving a sketch of the same. Mr. Elger's sketch of the north
part of Plato and Mr. Whitley's are not in accordance. The time at which Mr.

Whitley made his observations is not mentioned; Mr. Elger's 8.45 to 11.
   1870, March 14. Mr. Elger writes : "The markings were not well seen;

the eastern arm of the ' trident' was the brightest, and could be traced from
the south rim to Jfo. 1, passing to the west of No. 5 : the marking y was
very plain, the rest of the markings were faint and difficult to make out." In
contrast with this indistinctness on Plato, Mr. Elger says, " [In spite of the hazi-
ness of the sky, the markings and minute details of the Mare Tnibnuni were seen
with unusual distinctness]." In the 'English Mechanic,' No. 312, March 17,
1871, p. 602, article "Mars," by E.R.A.S., the author speaks of the indi-
stinctness and partial dimming on the surface of the planet, accompanied by
the presence of dark lines in its spectrum, coincident with those referable
by Father Secchi to the vapour of water. The indistinctness and dimming

of detail are alike distinguishable on Mars and the Moon ; and in addition we
have on the Moon a number of spots becoming vividly bright with a high
sun. From Dr. Huggins's observations, the spectral lines of the vapour of

water are absent in the lunar spectrum.
    1870, June 10. Mr. Elger recorded No. 17 decidedly brighter than No. 5 and

equal to No. 3; 14 only glimpsed once or twice ; 16 and 25 frequently seen.

   1869, December 15. This evening Mr. Elger discovered spot No. 32. He

described it as N.E. of spot No. 3, nearly aligning with 17 and 4, and situ-
ated on a brush of light (GledhiU's streak /3), extending from No. 3 to the
N.E. rim of Plato.

   1871, March 3. Mr. Pratt observed 16 spots, viz. 1, 3, 4, 5, 14, 17, 21,

20, 23, 29, 0, 18, 13, 19, 7, 6, arranged according to relative brightness.

Of these Mr. Pratt speaks of Nos. 20 and 21 as being far above their usual
brightness. Situated as they are near the north border, the Moon going
north in latitude, they were not in the most favourable position for observa-
tion ; their great brightness is therefore remarkable, and connected with this
is an increase of brightness in the streak a. The new streak between Nos. 5
and 17 Mr. Pratt saw with ease, joining the east arm of the "trident" with
the " sector" from closely south of 17 to opposite 5.

    1870, October 6. Mr. Gledhill records Nos. 1, 17, and 30 as fine bright
disks ; Nos. 5 and 6 equal. Mr. Elger observed Nos. 14 and 16, not seen by
Mr. Gledhill ; 14 was equal to 5.

                                       Interval 108 to 120 hours,

    1870, September 7. Mr. GledhiU records Nos. 1 and 3 as fine sparkling
disks, and 4 as a hazy spot. Mr. Neison records Nos. 1, 3, 4, and 5 pretty
distinctly visible; 17 brilliant but not well defined; 14 and 16 faint and

very faint respectively.

    1869, November 16. Mr. GledhUl says, " I never saw the floor so bright.
The spots 1, 17, 9, 3, and 30 appeared just like small stars in the transit-
instrument on a windy night." At 10, 11, and 12 hours Mr. Gledhill
remarked that spots Nos. 3, 1, 9, and 17 formed a sparkling curve, and were
fine easy objects, seen at a glance at any moment ; he says they were very
striking. On the contrary, he speaks of spots 23, 16, 19, 13, and 14 as very
difficult objects ; none were ever easy objects. Of 9 and 11 he says, " I
never saw them so easily and well as to-night." The following notes are
        OBSERVATIONS OF LUNAR OBJECTS.                    81

--important : " Nos. 1, 3, and especially 17 (which sni-passes all in sharpness,

and perhaps in brightness sometimes) are fine easy objects, "vvith moderate

altitudes. Now Linno never a2)pears like these except when near the even-

ing terminator. As to y Posidonius 1 never see it sharp and crater-Hke
(white and bright) when the sun is up. I could not see it at all the other
day when the morning terminator was a degree or two from it." Of ivhite
spots Mr. Gledhill remarks : " I called some spots mere white spots, because 1
have never seen them otherwise ; by-aud-by 1 may catch them near the
terminator, and have reason to change the term. I fancy that when the

terminator is a morning one the effect on objects diflfers from that given by

the evening terminator.''

                           Interval 120 to 132 hours.

    1871, March 4. Mr. K'eison saw spot No. 14 very indistinct, and barely
brighter than a longitudinal steak running in a direction from No. 13 to past
No. 14, which was then situated upon it. It appeared to have its origin eX

the point of convergence of Gledhill's d and L On the same evening, Mr.
Gledhill recorded d but not c. On March 4, Mr. Neison saw No. 16 (once

only) as a pecuhar light-marked spot on a patch of broken light trending

westward. Mr. Neison also recorded parts of the N.W. and S.E. portions

of the floor indistinct from broken light and light streaks.
    1870, June 11. Mr. Elger recorded spots Nos. 5 and 16 as seen only by

glimpses.

                                      Intei-val 132 to 144 hours.

1870, April 14. Mr. Gledhill records Nos. 1, 3, 4, 17, 9, 11, and 30 as

bright round disks. Mr. Elger writes, under date of April 26, 1870, relative

--to his observations of April 14, as follows : " That the visibility of the spots

is connected with the position and brightness of the markings (as you sug-

gest) is, I think, most probable : it is clear that the spots at present known are

mainly confined to the districts occupied by the markings, and that the floor

of Plata is divided by the latter   Eic

into three nearly equal areas. A,

AB, C, as on sketch. Areas and C

are covered with markings, but

area B is devoid of them. If

we compare the number of spots

in area B with the number of

Aspots in areas and C, we shall

find that there are only two spots

(23 and 11) in area B, while in

Aarea there are ten, and in area

C no less than twenty-three. It

is true that small portions of the

Aareas  and C ai'e without

markings ; but the spots within those areas are, without an exception, situ-
ated either tqmi the light streaks or close to their borders. These facts

seem to me very suggestive, and point to an intimate relation between the

spots and markings. As observations accumulate, your present behef in a
connexion between the phenomena will, I think, be placed beyond doubt."
In connexion with the above, the following quotation from a letter by Mr.

--Pratt, dated 1870, April 22, is interesting: "Very curious the difficulty

there is in observing such delicate detail possibly instruments and eyes will
                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

yious impressions ; and I rather fear that telescopes much larger than my

own cannot help us out of the difficulty."
   The difficulty to which Mr. Pratt alludes is particularly felt with regard

to that indispensable method of determining positions " measirrement." Mr.
GledhUl has executed some measures of the positions of the principal spots
and the extremities of the light markings, and Mr. Pratt has aligned several
of the spots with objects on the border ; but so exceedingly delicate are the
details, and so seldom is the state of the atmosphere siifficiently translucent
and free from agitation, that to obtain an approximate plan of the spots and
markings from measurement is necessarily a work of time. Pending this,
in the above sketch both spots and markings have been inserted, partly on
alignment and partly bj' estimation. The two light regions are well sprink-
led with spots, as pointed out by Mr. Elger ; and it is not a Kttle interesting
to notice that the nearly spotless area coincides with the region between-
the "trident" and the " sector," with its prolongation to " Webb's Elbow"
near the X.W. border. In the absence of more accurate detail, which is likely
to be obtained from Mr. GledhiU's measurements, the sketch (fig. 7) will serve
as a guide for ascertaining if the spots and markings preserve their relative
positions ; and in this connexion the remarkable change of locality, if it be so,

of spot Xo. 5 may be mentioned, Mr. Elger having seen and recorded on three
occasions (1870, March 14, May 13, and October 10) its position on the eastern
edge of the eastern arm of the " trident." It is possible there may be two
neighbouring spots in this locality which have not yet been seen together. The

importance of recording with eveiy obsei'vation of spot Xo. 5 its position with
regard to the eastern ann of the "trident" is obvious. The light streak
supposed to be connected with No. 5 is too far south, or the sjjot is too far north,'
on the sketch.

   1870, May 13. Vide " Indications of intermittent visibility" (p. 88).
   1870, January 15. Mr. Gledhill observed as many as 22 spots, the second

greater number seen on any one occasion. Vide " Indications of inter-
mittent visibility." Spots Xos. 1, 3, and 17 are described as very easy, large,
bright, sharp objects ; Xo. 4 as jumping into view and not steadily seen.
Xo. 34 was discovered this evening ; it has not been observed since
March 13, 1870, when it was recorded as an easy object.

    1869, August 20, 21, and 23. Mr. Gledhill gives thi-ee spots close to the

X.W. border, which he has marked 13, 19, and 16. No. 16 being too far
east for that spot, I have regarded it as 20 ; if, however, Mr. Gledhill really
saw 16, its degree of visibility would be shghtly increased. On August 23
Mr. Pratt gives 16 in its proper position, and he observed the same number of
spots as Mr. GledhiU ; but Mr. Gledhill saw No. 12 and 31, which Mr. Pratt
did not see, Mr. Pratt recording Nos. 7 and 30, not seen by Mr. Gledhill.

    1870, September 8. Mr. Neison records spot No. 4 as a flat indistinct
spot; 17 sharp but bright, darkening on one side, and showing traces of a

crater-formation.

                                      Interval 144 to 156 hours.
    1870, August 10. Mr. Neison records spot No. 3 as apparently oval ; the
longer axis of the ellipse is in the direction of No. 31
   1870, October 8. Mr. Elger mentions No. 14 as very easy, 16 easy, and
17 seen only occasionally.

                                      Interval 156 to 168 hours.

   1870, May 14. Mr. Elger recorded No. 16 easy; 5, 14, and 17 faint; 25

and 32 seen by glimpses. Mr. GledhiU records 1, 17, 3, and 6 as bright
disks. 4 not well seen, and 5 as a bright spot.

thought that when power 115 was used, spot No. 4 was almost at any time
to be seen, or at any rate a condensation of the ' sector' at its apex was
seen. On ajiplyiug 240, however, the appearance vanishes, and no con-
densation or spot is seen, or perhaps only sometimes and at intervals."

        Interval Meridian Passage to 168 hours.

1870, July 13. Mr. Gledhill records No. 1 as very bright.

1870, September 10. Mr. Elger records Nos. 2-5 and 16 as easy, No. 14

as seen by glimpses.

                      Interval 168 to 156 hours.

1870, August 12. Mr. Neison records "a spot seen on the border of No.

3, very small and hardly visible except at intervals, but pretty bright on

edge only of the light marking." Mr. Neison suspected it to be No. 31,

which it undoubtedly is according to the position which he has accorded to

it on the diagram. Mr. Neison was the only observer who detected No. 31

during this lunation, on the 10th and 11th of August, as an elongation of

No. 3. Mr. Elger, Mr. Gledhill, and ili-. Pratt appear to have missed it. Query,
was the groixp Nos. 3, 30, and 31 in greater activity about this time ?
Mr. Neison has this note, " 3. Faint indications of its being a crater very
distinct." Mr. Pratt records: "During the long period since I last saw

the light streaks I have had little opportunity to study former sketches, and so
was free in a measure of the bias of them. Yet on sketching those seen,

the forms, positions, and directions coincide with former drawings, notably

the trident a, /S, rj, I." Mr. Pratt also notices a remarkable increase in

brightness of spot No. 22, so as to attract especial attention. Neither

Messrs. Elger, Neison, Ormesher, nor Gledhill noticed this spot, although

they were observing on the same evening as Mr. Pratt, who further re-
marks " that in moments of best definition the area comprised between
Nos. 19, 1, and 4 was not nearly so well displayed as the rest of the floor,
giving a strong impression of an obscuring medium located there." [This

observation of the streak 1, the existence of which has been questioned, is
perfectly independent of any suspicion of its non-existence, as it occurred
some months before the question was raised.]

   1870, October 10. Mr. Elger found spot No. 5 on the E. edge of the E.

arm of the "trident;" its position, as given by Mr. Pratt, is on the W.
edge of the E. arm. He also found that Nos. 5 and 14 were far inferior

to 17. Spot No. 25 was easy. Mr. Elger did not see spots Nos. 9, 11, 18,
23, nor 30 recorded by Mr. Gledhill, nor did Mr. Gledhill see No. 14. For a

special note on the position of spot No. 5, which Mr. Elger also saw on the

E. edge of the " trident" on May 13, 1870, see Interval 132 to 144 hours.
   1870. On the 12th of August, and on September 7, 11, and 12, Mr.

Neison made a series of observations with apertures varying from 4 to Sc-
inches, with differences of 5 of an inch.

Inches                4 4| 4^ 4| 5 5;^

   The spots seen were Nos. 1, 3, 4, and 17 with 4 and 4| inch apertures, the
game and No. 6 with 4| and 4f ; with 5 inches aperture spot No. 14 was
detected and marked as faint, and with 5| inches No. 16 was discerned:

                                                                        g2
84 REPORT 1871.

the last two, Nos. 14 and 16, were in all cases marked as " faint," some-

times extremely so.
   These seven spots are precisely those which have the highest degrees of

visibility for 18 lunations, as under :

   Spots                   1 3 4 17 5 14 16

   YisibiHty .. 1-000 -897 -887 -830 -510 -433 -294

   From these observations, it appears that spots Nos. 1, 3, 4, and 17 may
be detected with instruments between 4 and 41 inches of aperture, that spot
No. 5 requires an extra half inch, or 4| to 5, and that 5 and 5| will bring

out spots No. 14 (5 inches) and 16 (5| inches).
   Aperture, of course, is an important element of visibility; and as these

spots are seen with apertures under six inches, as the observations increase,
and the normal degrees of visibility become well determined, variations in

the visibility of these spots may be detected with instruments of 6 inches

aperture, provided the observations extend over a sufficiently long period.

    1870, July 14. Mr. Gledhill records No. 1 as a fine, large, bright spot,
No. 17 as a small bright spot, Nos. 3 and 30 as bright spots, and No. 5 a

bright spot, seen now and then. Mr. lugall records No. 1 as very plain

and sharp. No. 4 as steadily seen, and Nos. 3, 31, 30 a misty spot, piobably

consisting of these three.

   1869, August 23. Mr. Pratt records that "spots Nos. 1, 3, 4, 17, 6, and 14
were very bright compared with their usual appearance, and aU easily seen.
No. 4 was not well defined; there was a persistent oval light round it (N.W.

and S.E), and I several times believed it to be double, but could not be positive

it was so. So remarkably clear was the vision that several times as many as

four or Jive spots were held in view at once, without looking directly for

them, and two or three times as many as six were so seen, viz. Nos. 1, 3,

4, 17, 5, and 14 ; again, Nos, 1, 3, 4, 17, 6, and 5. Nos. 4, 7, 6, 17 were

a  group  seen  together,  and  Nos. 5,  14,  22, and  1 were a similar       one yet
                                                                                               ;

still so exceedingly delicate are the fainter spots and the fainter traces of

light on the floor that it needs a most concentrated attention to see cither.

In looking for the faint spots the faint traces of light will escape notice

again, when looking for the latter, the former are most likely not to be

seen. This exceeding delicacy too interposes a serious difficidty in cdigning

them with objects on or near the border : the eye cannot hold so wide a

view and at the same time retain a sufficiently correct impression of objects

at once so faint and small. These remarks do not apply to the easier spots

and light streaks. Once, for a few minutes, a narrow, dark, straight line,

mlike a pencil-mark, was visible from towards liamlleta [i. e. from N.W.

    1871, March 8. Mr. Ormesher records a spot near the S.W. border,

which he queries " 14, a long way off " from its position. Is it a spot not

 before recorded ?

    1870, August 13. Mr. Gledhill records spots Nos. 3 and 17 as fine bright
disks. No. 1 as a fine, largo, bright disk, and No. 4 as a nebulous object.
Mr. Pratt remarks that " on this evening, as ivell as in 1870, August 12,

the tint of the dark portions of the floor was much intensified close to the

rim. It was the case all round, but especially so between 6 and ^, between
e and ^, and between /3 and rj."

    1869, December 20. Mr. Pratt places a spot nearly due north of No. 1
on the diagram of this evening, wliich he queries as 23. I query it as un-
certain. Spots Nos. 1, 0, 23, and 16 very nearly align. The line passing
through Nos. 1, 0, and 23 passes slightly west of No. 16. Mr. Pratt's spot
is very decidedly east of this line. [1871, March 31. The spot registered
by Mr. Pratt on Dec. 20, 1869, not having been reobserved, it is probable

   1870, July 16. Mr. Gledhill records spot No. 1 as "a fine, large, bright disk;

--looks like an elevation ;" also Nos. 3 and 17 as bright disks. I have made

the following note on the Form : " 9 and 0. These do not appear in their
precise localities, especially 0. It may be that the spot thus marked by
Mr. Gledhill is a new one."

  A1870, December 12. Mr. Pratt writes : " faint crepusciilar kind of

shade has crept over the western part of the floor, and is deepest near the
western border ; but the gradation is very delicate, 12 hours to 12 hours 40
minutes." [1870, March 24. Mr. Gledhill noticed a darker tint at the west
part of the floor, and furnished a tinted sketch : see remarks under this
date (p. 87) ; also Mr. Elger's observations of the same portion of the floor
being light, under date 1870, August 6, interval 48 to 60 hours.]

    1870, November 11. Mr. Gledhill records spots Nos. 1, 3, 30, and 17 as
brk/ht S2)ots. On the 13 of September (same interval) he recorded them as
"bright or fine craters;" with the exception of Mr. Nelson's record on
August 12 of No. 3 as a suspected crater (interval 168 to 156 hours), this in-
terval (108 to 96 hours) is the earliest in the declining day that the four have
been seen as craters. The terminator is recorded as west of Fracastorius.

    1870, September 13. Mr. Gledhill records spots Nos. 1, 17, and 30 as
bright or fine craters, and says of 17, " fine crater as 1 and 3; " but of 3
he says, " fine disk." I have marked 3 as a crater.

    1870, August 15. Mr. Pratt records that the darker margins of the
sbiided parts of the floor are still visible as on the 12th and 13th August,
but not in such striking contrast.

    1870, October 13. Mr. Pratt records spot No. 1 as brilliant, the others
dimmer than usual.

                                        Interval 84 to 72 hours.
   1869, August 26. Mr. Pratt remarked a decided difference in definition

in different parts of the floor, even in so contracted an area, the whole
northern half being less well defined, the south-east part the best so by

mfar. Traces of the line from to Eambleta were caught, and the floor

appeared unlevel, the central and south parts appearing highest, and the
south-west part next so. This, Mr. Pratt says, requires confirmation.

    1870, September 14. Mr. GledhiU records No. 3 as a fine wide double spot
(i.e. 3 and 30). Mr. Ncison (same day) remarks as follows of Nos. 1,
3, and 17, seen by Mr. Gledhill as craters : No. 1 not very distinct ; No. 3
sharp and shaded, not very bright ; No. 17 very distinct.

                                        Interval 72 to 60 hours.

   1870, August 16. Mr. Pratt observed 3 spots only this evening. On

October 14 (same interval) 16 were observed, 9 by Mr. Gledhill and 7 by
Mr. Pratt, in addition. They both record the definition of the border as

"good;" Mr. Pratt says, "with interruptions." On August 16, Mr. Pratt

records the definition of the border as "bad." The following remark of Mr.

--Pratt is interesting in connexion with this paucity of spots : " The darker

parts or shaded portions of the floor were just perceptible with attention.

' Tint of floor' medium, much paler than on the 13th inst."

              Interval 48 to 36 hours.

    1870, August 17. Mr. Gledhill records No. 1 as a fine, large, open crater,
3 and 30 as craters, 17 as a small crater, and 4 as a bright but not de-

finite spot.

              Interval 36 to 24 hours.

    1870, March 23. Mr. Gledhill writes : " The shadow of the elevated ob-
ject on the east border (the rock !!,), close to the N. of "W. II YJ''^, was on
the floor, and the adjacent floor to the N.W. was very bright, much brighter

than a or the ' sector,' and it extended one third of the distance from the

border to spot No. 4, as in sketch." Mr. Gledhill could not determine its
form, but considered that it was the streak tj intensified.

    1870, July 19. Mr. Gledhill observed the four craters 1, 17, 3, 30 only;

he described No. 1 as a large circular crater with raised walls, but not

much brighter than the floor.
   1869, August 28. Mr. Pratt writes : " The level of the floor was con-

mspicuously divided by the line from to c, the ground sloping east and

'west of this lino, the eastern part being brighter than the part on its west,
while the locality of spot No. 4 was judged to be the highest of the whole

floor." In connexion with this remark of Mr. Pratt it may be well to

"notice that, combined with Mr. Elger's observations on 1870, Jan. 10, of

a depression in the floor east of No. 1 (see Interval 12 to 24 hours), the two

suggest that this depression does not extend so far as No. 4. Again, com-

paring this observation of the western part of the floor being darker than

the eastern, which is in accordance with Mr. GledhiU's on March 24, 1870
(see Interval 12 to hours), it would appear that Mr. Elger's observa-

tion of the bright western area on 1870, May 9 and 10 and August 6, was

an intensified brightness of the ordinary brilliancy of the floor, sloping to the
west. The Intervals 24 to 36 and 48 to 60 hours, the season spring, with

the sun's altitude about 14°, seem to indicate that the increased brightness
was quite independent of illuminating angle.

   Speaking of the ajiparent changes observed, not only on Plato, but over
a -wider range, between August 16 and 28, 1869, Mr. Pratt says : " Thus,

among apparent changes of a particular characterj and restricted to certain
OBSERVATIONS OF LUNAR OBJECTS.                       87

small localities, there does appear to have been a wider and more gene-
ral disturbance in the brightness and definition of objects, all which dis-
turbance appears to be confined to the loiu-lying lands of that part of the
moon observed. Not that changes were not visible in high regions ; but
those are more easily referred to changes of illuminating and visual angle,
while the disturbances above mentioned are not so easily accounted for,
especially those changes in the visibUity of the light-streaks on the floor
and the striking differences of brightness of the spots."

    1809, October 26. In connexion with Mr. Gledhill's return of this date

I remark, " 'Crater Eow' being so well seen, and the border of Plato so sharp
and distinct, it is remarkable that spots Nos. 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, and 16 should

not have been well and easily seen, although it appears they were seen, also

that spot No. 3 should have been seen single, and that only sometimes, when ifc
was seen double the previous night."

   1870, November 14. Mr. Gledhill observed Nos. 1, 3, 30, and 17 as
craters, and says, " they look like bright elevated rings."

                                     Interval 24 to 12 hours.

   1870, March 23. See ante. Interval 36 to 24 hours.
   1869, September 27. Mr. Gledhill recorded a broad band of brightness
parallel to the north border, enclosing spots Nos. 13, 19, and 16 ; he does
not say they were seen as well as the bright baud. I have, however, re-
corded them as having been seen.

Interval 12 to hours or sunset.

1870, November 15. The four craterlets Nos. 1, 3, 30, and 17 are de-

scribed by Mr. Gledhill as elevated crater-cones.

1870, March 24. Mr. GledhiU writes :--" Terminator on N.E. end of

AApennines ; the eastern shadows lie on the floor.   line drawn along

the west edge of the ' sector,' and produced to the north border, separates

the bright east part of the floor from the darker west part ; the inner slope

of the west wall glows in sunlight, while the floor near it is the darkest

portion of the crater [Plato]." See ]}. 95, line 9.

Additional Notes.

                         Differences of Visibility of neighbouring Objects.

    1869, August 26, 11 hours 30 minutes. Definition frequently exceed-

ingly good but disturbed, with much boiling at times. Mr. Pratt has fur-

nished the following record :

   " There was a marked difference between the M. Imbnum, the M.
Serenitatis, and the M. Frigoris, in respect of the visibility of minute objects
on their surfaces. The Mare Imbrium was literally covered with small white
sjwts and streaks. The three streaks from Aristillus to the south border of

Plato were again traced. Archimedes had roughly four light streaks E. and
W., and about nine or ten easily discerned white spots. Beer and Mddler
and neighbourhood looked invitingly for a close study.

    " The Mare Serenitatis was of a dull grey, with few white spots and
comparatively few features visible. Gf those visible all were very indistinct,
EXCEPT THE MORE ELEVATED ONES ; thus, of the Small objects rouud Linne,
most were invisible, a few indistinct, even I E«i, I E^^, I Ev^ [the three small
craters N.W. of Linne] were almost obscured. Linne itself a cloudy white
spot, with knot of light in centre, but not nearly so bright as when seen
on the 23rd inst. Posidonius y was brighter and half the size of Linne.
Vessel was tolerably clear. About half the number of white spots S.E. of

Bessel were very indistinctly seen, the renifiinder invisible. Posidonius,
just -within the terminator, "was fairly defined. SuJpicius Gallus and one
or two near it on the pleateau were clear ; so that the moke an object was
RAISED above the general level of the Mare the clearer was its deiinition,
while those on the level of it were more or less obscured.

    " The 3Iare Frigoris was very hazy indeed ; even close to the foot of the

north slope of Pluto objects could not be defined, while those raised a little

above the Mare were remarkably well defined indeed. The whole northern
slope of Plato appeared everywhere rugged and iineven."

     Indications of intermittent Visibility and of possible volcanic Activity.

   On the evening of the 13th of May, 1870, no less than tiventy-seven spots

were seen on the floor of Plato, 26 by Mr. Pratt, and an extra one by Mr.
Elger. This extraordinary display occurred between 132 and 144 hours
after the terminator had passed 4° E. long. It is, however, not a little
remarkable that, on the same evening, Mr. Gledhil!, at Halifax, observed
four spots only. The great number seen by Mr. Pratt, as compared with
the small niimber seen by Mr. GledhiU, is doubtless due to a fine state of
the earth's atmosphere at Brighton.

  --With regard to the streaks seen by Mr. Pratt on the same evening he

remarks " I could not see the small streaks on the western part of the floor,

and sometimes even my old 'trident'. and the streak c were so indistinct as to
be difficult. What was the cause ? Surely not the earth's atmosphere

for at the same time spots could be seen. Perhaps we shall discover that
spots are raised at a higher level than light streaks, and thus visible when

streaks are obscured."

    This remark of Mr. Pratt's is important : certainly the state of the earth's
atmosphere could not have affected the two classes of objects in different
ways. If the intensity of the spots depended upon the purity of our atmo-
sphere, one would think that the brightness of the streaks would also have
been increased ; but in Mr. Pratt's experience it was not so. Mr. Elger
speaks of some as bright and others faint. Mr. Gledhill, with a bad atmo-
sphere, speaks of them as bright ; but he saw only four spots. Are the spots

really brighter than the streaks ? But, then, why do both vary in brightness ?
    Mr. Pratt having perused [carefully] the MS. has furnished me with the

following remarks :

    " May it not be well to mention that, on the occasion referred to, 1870,
May 13, I observed fifteen st reals, one of which was a new one. [This
was the streak from spot jS^o. 5 towards No. 14.] This number was much
above the average, the cm-ious fact being that although so many were per-

 ceptible with attention, yet the increase in their brightness was in a lower

ratio than that of the spots. There are two possibilities which may aflfect the

--discrepancy[diflerence]betw'een the notes of Mr. Gledhill and myself in relation

to thestreaks: Eirst, the times at which ive observed, may have been different. As

 for myself, I tested the chance of working with any thing like satisfaction once
 at least every half hour during the whole of the evening, and before I tried for
 the last time, at 1 1 hours, had been unable to perceive either one spot or streak.

 Secondly, jjriority of observation bestowed on objects of one class may detract

from the estimated brilliancy of the other class. In my own case, immediately

 I went to the telescope, at 11 hours, I saw several spots conspicuously, and in

Aconsequence searched for spots alone for nearly an hour. search for so long a

 time for one class possibly may, in a slight measure, reduce the sensibility of
 the eye for objects of the other class, whether spots or streaks."

    The following extracts from Mr. Pratt's letter, dated 1870, May 19, are
OBSERVATIONS OP LUNAR OBJECTS.                                   89

--interesting : " Some spots having at different times been observed as cra-

myterlets, their character as volcanic is settled in  own mind.  Whether

all spots are analogous I should be glad to know ; but on the supposition of

such similarity existing, the suggestion naturally arises whether the light

streaks be not scoriae or lava, or a mixture of both, resulting from the action

of the craterlets with which they seem to be connected."

  A comparison of the curves for the 20 lunations, April 1869 to November

1870, is suggestive of the craterlets being a distinct class of objects. The
phenomena characterizing the cratelets, as indicated by the curves, differ

very materially from the phenomena manifested by the spots ; for example,
in the correspondence of the maxima at the time of the supposed outbreak
of Aug.-Sept. 1869, we have an increase of visibility in spots, the behaviour

of the craterlets being altogether different. Certain neighbouring spots, to

which allusion has been made, declined greatly in visibility, and were very

seldom seen during a period in which the craterlets were almost always

visible ; and in connexion with this it may be remembered that craterlets
are characterized by high degrees of visibility, while of many spots which

have large ranges the normal degrees of visibility are low.

   That a connexion exists between the streaks and spots is, as Mr. Pratt
remarks, "self-evident ;" and Mr. Elger has shown that most of the spots

occur on the streaks. Now as both spots and streaks vary in brilliancy and
visibility, may not the steaks consist, as Mr. Pratt suggests, of ejecta from

the volcanic orifices of the craterlets? The increased brightness of the

streaks in the neighbourhood of the border has been frequently noticed, as

well as the unevenness of the floor. It may be possible that newly ejected

matter (especially if it be of the character of "broken glass," suggested, I

believe, by Dr. Huggins as explanatory of the appearance of Linne) may

reflect light more strongly, and thus contribute to the brighter appearance

of the streaks about the time at which the craterlets manifest increased

activity, and this may become so great as even to conceal the craterlets
themselves. On the other hand, although we are perfectly ignorant of any

meteorological or chemical action occurring at the surface of the moon, it

may be permissible to suggest that, if such action be possible, the reflective
power of the ejecta may become impaired, and the streaks in consequence

rendered less bright.

It is exceedingly difficult to conceive that volcanic action can be in existence

on the moon's surface without "vapour" of some kind escaping from the

orifices. If this be the case, condensation must follow, and the orifice may be
covered by the condensed vapour, the upper surface of which may strongly

reflect the light and produce the appearance of a spot when not in a state of
actual eruption ; and this spot may be seen on a surface covered with ejecta,
the reflective power of which has been impaired since it left the orifice.

   One of the brightest portions of the floor of Plato is the S.E., which is
characterized by the "sector" or "fan." On the 10th of January, 1870,
!l[r. Gledhill observed as many as nine crater-cones on the eastern part of

the floor, viz. Nos. 1, 9, 11, 17, 4, 3, 30, 7, and 32. It is easily con-

ceivable that ejecta from some of these may be the perennial source of the

reflective power of the " sector."
    " It is, as far as I can see," says Mr. Pratt, " not at all proven that it is

impossible that they, the spots, may not be small acting volcanos at this
present moment ; and you will please credit me with having noted that, on

the 13th of May, although the spots were very greatly in excess of their

usual brightness, the relative brilliancy of the light streaks was not nearly
--90 . REPORT 1871.

in the 8ame proportion, indeed not so high as on some nights when fewer
spots have heen visible. The supposition of Schroter of an exceedingly low
atmosphere, confined to the lower regions, seems to me especially consonant
with the above observations, for the following among other reasons :

  A" thin atmosphere, the only possible detection of which is confined to the

lower parts of the floor [that is within the mountainous enclosure of Plato],

may obscure the streaks partially [to effect this there must be condensed

material of some kind] without affecting the spots, which, if craterlets, are
raised more or less above the level of the streaks [the low fogs, the upper sur-

faces of which are at a less elevation than ordinary buildings are high, may be

cited as examples] ; for such an atmosphere would probably be rendered more
dense by and during the supposed activity in the spots, which on that night
were unusually bright and, according to the hypothesis, in action. [It must
not be forgotten that on comparing the observations of Mr. Pratt with those
of Mr. Gledhill, the presumption is that the iinusual number and brilliancy
of the spots was simply the effect of a finer atmosphere at Brighton as
compared with that at Halifax. The phenomenon which is at variance with

this is the less brihiancy of the streaks as recorded by Mr. Pratt ; still we

have the bright streaks of Mr. Gledhill supporting the hypothesis of the effects
of the earth's atmosphere.] Hence after a subsidence of the brightness of the

spots and the restoration of the normal state of the atmosphere, we might

expect to see the streaks come out more distinctly."

   It wiU be remarked that, in my suggestions above, the increased bright-

ness of the streaks is supposed to depend upon the craterlets actually
ejecting material, while the increased brightness of the spots depends upon
the escape of vapour. I have not quoted Mr. Pratt's remarks for the

purpose of controverting them ; they appear to me to be exceedingly

valuable, and in the present state of selenological inquiry it is important

to canvass every view that may be put forward. It is quite consonant with

both our views that increased activity in a spot may, and doubtless does,
manifest itself by increased brilliancy ; and it is not unlikely that the forma-

tion of a spot in the way suggested over a volcanic orifice otherwise invisible
may precede an actual eruption, contributing to an increased brilliancy of

the streaks if they really result from volcanic ejecta.

  --On the agencies capable of affecting the visibility of objects on the moon

Mr. Pratt remarks : " To my own mind the only likely agencies that can

exist in the moon capable of affecting the visibility of objects are the every-
where-denied lunar atmosphere and real volcanic activity ; as far as I can

learn, the observations of some favour the one agency, while other observations
do the same for the other, at the same time that different observei-s
alternately deny the possible existence of either. Surely they are very
closely related. If volcanic activity be established, can it exist without
an atmosijhere ? AVhile if a low atmosphere be established, would not the
stronger objection to present volcanic activity be removed? The hope that
persistent and minute observation of a suitable region might produce a
result sufficient either to weaken or strengthen the supposition has been at

once the impetus and bond which has induced me to give a large share of
attention to Plato. "We may not have attained such a result even yet ; but
possibly continued application may be rewarded. I hope so. The close

study of typical species is generally the best method of acquiring a good

--knowledge of genera."
    Mr. Pratt further adds: " The reverse of what I have here stated I have
several times observed, viz. that the light streaks on those occasions were
OBSERVATIONS Or LUNAR OBJECTS.  91

much hrigTiter relativehj to their best state thaa were the spots, of ·which

generally at those times lew have been discernible."

should be directed. Of the remainder, three have been observed orn^e only
by Mr. Gledhill, viz. Wos. 26, 28, and 3-5 ; two have been observed twice,
viz. Nos. 27 and 33 ; two thrice, both old spots, viz. 8 (Gruithuisen) and 15
(Dawes); and one, 1^0.34, six times between January 15 and March 13, 1870*.

   In his letter dated 1870, May 19, Mr. Pratt says that " spot No. 8 could

not be recovered even with the most minute attention." Of spot No. 1 he
says, " it was brighter than I have seen it before, quite round and dense,
much hke the image of a star on a good night surrounded by the very least

trace of a ring of light. [Neither] internal nor external shadows could be
seen, although I constantly expected a slight glimpse."

                                                   Spot No. 22.

   In reference to this spot Mr. Pratt writes, under date 1870 August 2Q, as

follows :

   " Spot No. 22, according to my observations, has manifested a remarkable

increase of brightness, and those parts of the shaded portions of the floor of
Plato which are nearest to the rim have come out more conspicuously darker
than the rest than I remember to have previously noted. The tint of the
floor, too, has progressively paled. These three phenomena [the increased

brightness of spot 22, the intensification of the darker parts of the floor near

the rim, and the progressive paling of the floor] may possibly be connected
by a common cause ; for certainly in this lunation there is somewhat of a

coincidence amongst them ; for instance, spot 22 is intensely bright at the
time the marginal portions of the shaded parts are most conspicuously dark,
and these two, again, coincide with the time when the general tint of the
floor is at its darkest. Again, after August 12 and 13, spot 22 decreased in

relative intensity, although I am not ready to hazard the assertion that it

had on August 16 positively declined to its \isual intensity, as it was not
seen. [It was on this evening that Mr. Pratt observed three spots only.]

Two similar instances, I believe, I have noted before, when 22 manifested a

singular brightness at sunrise. But the connexion between the visibility of
the deeper-tinted margin and the general deepening of colour is perhaps more
close still, as both certainly paled after August 13. The perplexity seems to
be that the variation in intensity of the margin is relative in respect of the
general colour ; and if difiorences of angles of illumination and vision do affect
the general tint, it might be supposed that they would in the same manner
afi'ect the margin and so produce no relative variation of intensity."

    In connexion with the relative intensity of which Mr. Pratt speaks, the

state of the border is somewhat important. August 12 and 13, when the

--marginal portions of the floor were intensified in colour, Mr. Pratt recorded

of the border : " Definition fair at times, with much tremor, wind N.E."
This was on the 12th. On the 13th the record is : " Border, definition bad,

*  The history of spot No. 34 is curious                                                                                                                                                        the following are the only records which exist

much boiling, wind N.E." On the 12th, definition fair, the floor was recorded

as " very dark." On the 13th it was dark, but not so much so as on the

12th. On the 16th, as well as on the 15th, the definition of the border was

" bad." These records clearly throw a doubt upon the supposition of the

" paling " having resulted from some lunar action, inasmiich as when, the

deeper tint was observed the definition was "good," the "tremor" and

" boiling " having a tendency to confuse the portions of the floor. On the

other hand, spots have been much more numerous with bad definition than

3 as observed by Mr. Pratt on the l(3th ; and this would lead to the supposition
that the (qrparent extinction of the spots with a pale floor was in some

way differently connected than by a deteriorated state of the earth's atmo-

sphere. I have often observed that the passage of a thin cloud over the

moon has greatly contributed to intensify the tints of the darker portions of

the surface ; but in this case the intensification has been general and not

partial, as it would be if dependent upon local lunar action.

Mr. Pratt records a case of parfial obscuration which was well seen oil

AAugust 13. " It appeared," says Mr. Pratt, " on this wise.    general view

of the floor showed it much speckled and streaked in other pai'ts ; but over

the area specified [Mr. Pratt has not mentioned the particidar part of the

floor ; but from what follows I apprehend it must be in the neighbourhood of

No. 3] there seemed an absence of markings ; close attention, however,

enabled some to be seen, but not nearly so richly as the remainder of the

floor, and we know well enough that that particular area is not wanting in

markings. The evening's view has just occurred to memory when I first

discovered that spot 3 was a triple one, and had a remarkalile view of its

neighbourhood [Qy. "Was this on May 13 ?], therefore exactly the reverse

being the case. August 13 seems as conclusive a proof as one observer is

likely to obtain in a year's work."

Of four observers on the same evening, two record No. 3, and the other

two appear not to have seen it. Taking them in chronological order, Neison,

9.5 to 9.15, records it as distinct ; Pratt, 10.30 to 12.30, did not observe

it; Ormesher, 11.0 to 11.30, does not show it in his drawing; Gledhill,

14'', records it as a bright disk : he also records 30. As these observations

are not contemporaneous, with the exception of Ormcsher's, having been

made while Pratt was observing, it appears, from its absence in both their

records, that from 10.30 to 12.30 it was really not visible ; and this tends to
support Mr. Pratt's idea that for the time it was hidden by something like

an obscuring medium. "What this could have been it is difficult to surmise.

The remark, however, of Neison that 30 Avas not to be seen between 9.5

and 9.15 is interesting in connexion with Gledhill recording both spots at a

later epoch, 14'', and also detecting five not seen by Pratt, viz. 3, 30, 9, 11,
18. Neison suspected he saw 14, not recorded by Gledhill nor Pratt, but

seen by Ormesher. Pratt saw 22, not seen by either of the others. The

case of 14 is a little perplexing ; it might, however, have been missed by

Pratt on account of the bad definition. "With regard to the greater number

of spots seen by GledhiU, two circumstances may have contributed to this

result, the larger aperture of Mr. Crossley's instrument and the epoch at

which Mr. Gledhill observed. It may possibly be found that the greater

number of spots recorded after the sun's meridian passage at Plato depend

upon the. steadiness and purity of the air mostly experienced after midnight.

floor at 11" 40°'. That part of the floor contiguous to the W. and S.W.

rim was deeply shaded, with streaks of shade running towards the centre of

the floor. Between the break near c and the shadow of '( a straight shading

as of a narrow valley was weU seen. [These shadings appear to be roughly

coincident with the dark spaces on the floor as seen under high illumination,

the straight shading being, as Mr. Pratt suggests, between the "sector" and

the E. arm of the " trident." Is there really a valley here running inta

the central depression between 1 and 4, seen by Mr. Elger in January, 1870,

and observed much earlier by Schrbter?] Between these shadings and the

shadow of the E. rim were three roundish lighter regions, the higher parts of

the floor giving the appearance of a strongly marked convexity."

  A" strong suspicion arises that the apparently higher portions of the

floor are the light streaJcs usually seen, and the highest parts are spots 1, 17

and 5." Mr. Pratt further suggests that the light streaks are coincident

with formations analogous to " spurs "' from the chief centres of the residual

activity on the floor.

It is not a little remarkable that on the occasion of such a very favoiirable

oblique illumination the craterlets 1 and 17 should not have been detected

by Mr. Pratt ; both have raised rims of the nature of true volcanic cones,

and 1 has been seen, and I believe 17 also, with interior shadows and bright

interiors facing the sun. Mr. Pratt does not appear to have seen even the

remotest semblance of a shadow. The spots properlg so called do not appear

generally iintil the sun has attained an altitude of 20°. If craterlets are

recorded as spots earlier, it is probably in consequence of bad definition

confusing the crater-form appearance. Is it possible that on the two

occasions mentioned by Mr. Pratt, Oct. 17 and Nov. 1, the craterlets 1, 17,

3, and 4 were by some means concecded? As regards Nov. 1, the observation
of the crater-cones as the shadows gradually recede from E. to W. is very

frequent ; indeed the surface of Plato as it just emerges out of night ajjpears

to be in  a very different state  to what it is about mid-day                                                                                                                   objects are much

sharper, and it is difficult to conceive of any agency so affecting such visible

objects as to render them invisible at a time when they are generally most

conspicuous. So far as contemporaneous observations are capable of throwing

light on this phenomenon, three spots only were recorded on the same even-

ing ; No. 1 by Mr. Elger, who noticed it from 9'' to 9** S", near the shadow
of the summit of the middle peak of the W. wall, three hours later than
Mr. Pratt's observation. Mr. Gledhill at 6"*, same as Mr. Pratt, says, " Moon

so low and air so thick that very little light from moon can reach us ;" he
says also, " I sec 3 as double elevated cones [i.e. 3 and 30]. No other objects
can be seen." Mr. Neison, 5.10 to 8.15 [probably 8.10 to 8.15] succeeded

in seeing 3 only, which he records as very faint. He does not give the state

of the atmosphere as to definition ; but from his remarking that " a deep cleft

in west edge of wall was very distinctly seen," I should suppose that it was
pretty good. Taking the four sets of observations it would appear that at
sunrise on Plato Nov. 1, 1870, some ageney was in operation capable of

concealing the craterlets ; and combining these observations with those of
96 REPORT 1871.

Oct. X7, it would also appear that the same agency was in operation at the

time of the previous sunset.

times. The margin of the eastern end of the floor very distinctly shaded,

showing that end to he convex as well as the western. This shading did not
conform to the general form of rim, but ran inwards (as shown in the

sketch) ; and three places on the floor were much brighter than the rest,
which was free from shading (their localities I have no doubt are those of

spots 3, 4, and 17), while the next bright parts of the floor are suggestive
of the light streaks; and the shading or lower part coinciding with the

narrowing of the streak between 4 and 3 as seen under higher illumination

in a measure supports the impression."
   The dip of the floor towards the border, as mentioned by Mr. Pratt, is

now well established by numerous observations, also the comparatively

greater elevation in the neighbourhood of the fault crossing Plato from

N.W. to S.E. These characteristics will probably afford some clue towards

framing a theory of the formation of the plain and rampart. Starting with

the now acknowledged principle that the moon manifests on a large scale the

operation of volcanic forces, we may first inquire as to their modus operandi

in the forms we observe. So far as we know, volcanos and earthquakes are

closely connected, and there is great reason to believe that both are the

results of expansion occasioned by the intumescence of material beneath the

                              Pig. 8.

crust or surface. It was, I believe, Scropc who first called attention to the

effect of the expansion of an iutumescent mass elevating the superincumbent

material ; and Hopkins, twenty-two years later, clearly showed that when
the surface was elevated to the point at which the tension and cohesion just

balanced each other, the slightest increase of tension ruptured the surface
and produced fissures, which might be considerably augmented by earthquake-

waves accompanied by the sudden subsidence of the tract between two
principal lines of fissures. In applying this reasoning to the explanation of
the formation of " Plato," the remarks of Scrope are so much to_ the point
that a transcription of them is essential to the due apprehension of the

forces concerned.

    In chapter x. of his ' Considerations of Yolcanos,' p. 205 (1825), Scrope,
speaking of M. de Buch's opinion that the intumescence and rise of the
basalt elevated the superincumbent strata, says : " 1 differ from him, inas-

much as I conceive the intumescence and rise of the basalt to be not

the cause but the result of the elevation of the overlying strata.

   "A general fact, noticed by M. de Buch himself, proves this most

thoroughly, viz. that wherever the basalt appears, the strata are invariably
found dipping toivards it, which is wholly inexplicable under the idea that

the basalt elevated them. ... If, however, we suppose the expansion of

the subterranean bed of crystalHne rock to have taken place at a great depth,
elevating the overlying strata irregularly along the line of various fissures,

Aas for example at and B (fig. 8), it is clear such fissures will open outwardly
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

but in the interval of two such fissures, as at C, another must be found opening,

on the contrary, downivards, that is, towards the confined and heated lava,

which in consequence must intumesce and fill the space afforded to it, and
perhaps force its way through some minor cleft upon the external surface of

the elevated rocks."

Plato we know to be a large cavity in an elevated region, between the

Mare Imbrium and the Mare Frigoris, connected with the mountain-studded

region of the Alps on the west, and descending with a precipitous slope

towards the east. The whole of the surface around Plato is exceedingly

rugged, containing at least the remains of three craters of more ancient date.

It is the floor of Plato only that presents any appearance of a recent character

and even this when Aaewed by very obhque light is far from being level.
The sketch (fig. 8) to which reference has already been made is intended to con-
vey some idea of the successive steps by which it is probable that Plato has

arrived at its present form. It is roughly drawn to scale, which is somewhat

too small, and, consequently, the height of the rim rather exaggerated ; the

extent being 316,800 English feet, the height, under 4000 feet (i. e. of the

rim exclusive of the four pinnacles), will be nearly -j^jth part. The letters

A and B are placed over the supposed foci of expansion, the arrows indi-

cating the direction of the elevating movements, the dotted line showing the

extreme height to which the surface could be raised without fracture. Over

A and B, and above C, are placed the three main fissures resulting from the in-

creased tension and the general breaking up of the elevated mass, and which

might have been accompanied with an almost immediate subsidence, as sug-

gested by Hopkins, Eeport Brit. Assoc. 1847, p. 64, in the following passage :
" If the intumescence of the subjacent fluid, and consequently its supporting

power, were immediately afterwards diminished by the escape of elastic

vapours, there would be an immediate subsidence." Such a subsidence, or

rather a succession of subsidences, would fuUy account for the formation of

the  floors of most  craters                                and  the upwelling of lava from numerous small
                                                         ;

orifices would tend to produce such a floor as we observe on Plato. The

section presents all the characteristics of the walled plain under considera-

tion, the dip towards the border being strongly indicative of the main line of

fissiire opening outwardly at the foot of the rampart. It may be well to
mention that no new principle is introduced in this explanation, which is

based upon the views of two leading geologists, after comparing them with
phenomena that have been assiduously and repeatedly observed.

Since the date of the former Report the Committee have obtained a splendid

set of Kew standard thermometers. "With these, complete sets of observa-

tions, at very diiferent temperatures, have been made on iron, two specimens

of copper, lead, german silver, and gas-coke. As great difficulty was found

in keeping the source of heat at a constant high temperature in the statical

experiments, they were repeated from day to day tiU satisfactory results

were obtained. But a simple and ingenious device of Dr. Crum Brown (con-

riments with thia modification. This has accordingly been done, during the
present summer, but it has not yet been possible to perform the large amount

of calculation necessarj- to obtain final results. It may be stated, however,

that the results as a whole will not differ very considerably from those for-
merly obtained, so far, at least, as can be judged from a comparison of the
graphic representations of the experiments.

Report on the Rainfall of the British Isles, by a Committee, consisting

    Rogers Field, C.E., and G. J. Symoxs, Secretary.

YorB Committee have much pleasure in reporting that the organization
under their supervision is believed to be in a generally efficient state. With

a stafi" of observers, numbering nearly two thousand, spread over the whole
 extent of the British Isles, there can, however, be no question that, to ensure
perfect efficiency and uniformity of observation, a systematic inspection of
stations is absolutely necessary. In a paper read before the Society of Arts
in 185S, M!r. BaUey Denton appears to have considered that there should be

one inspector to about each 200 stations ; at that rate we ought to have ten.
The ;Meteorological Committee of the Royal Society have made it a rule to
have all their stations inspected each year. On the most moderate com-

 putation it is indisputable that at least one inspector of stations is required
 for our large body of observers, the whole of whose time should be devoted

 to travelling.

     Ever since their appointment yoiir Committee have felt and acted upon
 this conviction ; but want of funds has prevented them from employing a
 regular iuspector, and obliged them to rely solely upon the unpaid services of
 their Secretary. Even under these adverse conditions considerable progress
 has been made with the work, and upwards of 400 gauges had been visited
 and examined previous to the Liverpool Meeting. At that Meeting, how-

 ever, the Association only granted half the sum for which we asked, and we

 have consequently (most reluctantly) been obliged to stop this important
 and useful work.

     As an interim meastire, and with a view to ascertaining ia what districts
 inspection is most requisite, it has been suggested that a schedule of ques-

 tions as to the positions of their rain-gauges should be sent to every observer.

 The Committee unanimously approved of the suggestion, and annex a copy of
  the Circular and Schedule they are about to issue.

                                                                       British Association Rainfall Committee,

  be promptly obtained. They are aware that under present circumstances it
  is impossible that each gauge should be personally inspected, and have there-

  fore instructed me to ask you to fill up the accompanying form, which I

  shall be obliged by your returning as soon as possible.
     As an indication of the kind of information which the Committee desire

  to collect, I have filled up one form for my own gauge ; but there are of

result of wbicb we had hoped to have submitted to the present Meeting.
Excepting in our own Reports, we are not aware that the seasonal distribu-

tion of rain in this country has received any attention, while on the Con-
tinent it has at all times been looked upon as almost equally important with

the gross amount.
    Although several short and interrupted sets of observations have been

made in Northern Derbyshire, the rainfall of that hilly district has not
hitherto been examined with the thoroughness which its importance deserves.

"VVe have in previous Eeports urged the desii'ability of several additional
stations being established ; and as no one else undertook the work our Secre-
tary did so, and by the assistance of the observer at Buxton, and Mr.
Hazlewood, of Castleton, was enabled to commence several sets of rain-

gauge observations in the district. Some others are still required, which, if
our funds permit, we intend to add.

  --Pit-gauges. In our last Eeport we drew attention to the fact that a gauge

of which the orifice was horizontal, level with the ground, but in a small pit
or excavation, had at Calne collected about 5 per cent, more than one of which
the receiving surface was one foot above the ground ; whence it followed

that as a great many rain-gauges (the majority in fact) are placed with their

apertures a foot above the surface, the records of all these gauges were
below what they would have been if placed in pits as just described. "We
gave some reasons which appeared to us to prevent the general use of pit-
gauges, and added the following concluding remark on page 176 :

     " This result appears so startling that further experiments will be con-

ducted on the subject."

    The funds at our disposal have not allowed us to do so ; but fortunately the

Eev. F. W. Stow, M.A., has tried one pair of gauges mounted in this manner

at Hawsker, on the Yorkshire coast, a few miles south of Whitby. The
following are the results during 1870 :

             --Table I. Experiments with Pit-gauges.

                                   Hawsker, 1870.
          ON THE RAINFALL OF THE BRITISH ISLES.                  101

Of course it was not to be expected that the resxilts of a single year should

agree exactly with the mean of two other years, still less when the size of

gauge used was different, and the locality so opposite as the inland district

Weof Calne and the rock-bound Yorkshire coast.  therefore look upon it as

satisfactory that in only four months out of eleven do the ratios at Calne and

Hawsker differ more than 3 per cent. In April, June, and IS^ovemher they

are identical. The Calne results are thus strongly confirmed ; and it may be

considered as certain that pit-gauges always exceed those at one foot,

although the precise amount of excess remains to be determined.

In our last Eeport we expressed the hope that we should this year be able

to state the residt of the discussion of all the rainfall registers which were

Weabsolutely continuous from January 1, 1860, to December 31, 18G9.

have the pleasure of doing so in two respects, viz. (1) with reference to their
bearing on the question of the existence or otherwise of secular variation of

rainfall in the British Isles, and (2) as data indicative of the distribution of

rain over the country.

The secular variation of rainfall, or the relative dryness and wetness of

different years and groups of years, is one of the most important and difficult

branches of rainfall work. It has been treated in our Reports for 1865, and

very fully in that lor 1866. In the latter we gave the calculations in detail,

from which the values shown on the accompanying diagram were obtained.

Referring to that Report for full explanation, we have onljr now t-o mention

that the subsequent years 1866 to 1869 have been computed in the same

Wemanner and added to the diagram (fig. 1).  may also remark that various

observations collected since its publication have confirmed the general accuracy

of the curve quite as much as could have been anticipated. On the present
occasion we do not intend to discuss the relative rainfall of different years, but

the relation of the fall during the ten years 1860-69 to previous decades.

For this purpose we have grouped the yearly values in decennial periods,

similar to those adopted in our 1867 Report, whence we obtain the following

result :

Weis unnecessary to dwell further upon it.             now proceed to the second

part of our investigation, namely, to consider the distribution of the rain-

fall of the last decade, during which we have nearly four hundred perfect

sets of observations. As each set of observations comprises more than a

thousand entries, and the following Table contains the result of nearly half a
million observations, it is probable that it contains some slight percentage of

error, but we have no suspicdon of the existence of any which appreciably

affect the results.

The head-lines of the following Table sufficiently explain its contents.

 ing diagram (fig. 1) of the fluctuations of rainfall, we feel that it would suffi-

 ciently prove the impossibility of determining accurately the rainfall at any
 place except by observations continued over a long series of years at that
 place, or by difterentiation from some proximate long-continued series.

     (2) It does not follow that simultaneous observations, even for ten years,

giving for example a mean difference between two stations of five inches,
prove that the rainfall at the one station is greater than the other by that

amount, although if they are not very distant the one from the other it
would probably be a safe assumption.

    (3) Before mean results can be given with any pretensions to accuracy and
finality, they must be corrected for the elevation of the rain-gauge above the

ground.

    The above remarks sufaciently show that the mere average of the fall of
rain measured during ten or more years does not necessarily give the true
mean rainfall at that place.

   Let us take as an example the highest amount recorded in the Table
(Seathwaite), which had during the ten years (1860-69) an average of
154 inches ; many persons would say at once that tliat was therefore the
mean rainfall at that station. It is, however, nothing like it. From

Table II. and fig. 2 we see that the rainfall over England, generally,

during those ten yeaz's was 1-5 per cent, above the average, upon which

evidence we are bound to reduce the observed mean in that proportion,
and then the average becomes 152 inches instead of 154. Even this, how-
ever, is not correct ; for we pointed out in condition (2) that the same
years, or groups of years, are not similarly wet in aU parts of the country.
Referring, therefore, to Table lY. we find that at the nearest station to

Seathwaite, Kendal, the decade in question was 7 per cent, above the thirty-
year mean ; hence, on the supposition that the Kendal values are applicable

to this station, we have to reduce 154 inches by 7 per cent, instead of by
1-5 per cent., and hence the probable mean comes out 141-8 inches.

  Now most fortunately we can test the accuracy of this calculation in three

ways.

   (1) The mean fall at Seathwaite in the previous decade was 126-98 ; from
the Kendal observations the fall in that decade was 10 per cent, less than

                      --(126^---9=8 141-09                                                                                                    \  we  find  the  probable  mean       comes
                                                                                                                                              \

out 141-1 from this decade, and 141-8 from that of 1860-69. They thus

agree within less than an inch, or one half per cent.

   (2) The fall at Seathwaite has now been continuously observed for twenty-six
years, viz. from 1845 to 1870 inclusive ; the mean of the whole twenty-six

years' observations is 140-03.

   (3) This value, corrected according to the Table in ourl866Eeport, becomes
141-44, agreeing exactly with that indicated by the decades 1850-59 and
1860-69.

--This example proves three points :- (1) the great degree of accuracy which
is attainable by proper methods
                                                                                                                                           ;  (2) the care requisite to secure it ;  (3) the

serious errors inseparable from the use of mere arithmetical averages without

reference to secular changes.

   These observations, however, must of course be taken as general results,
and not be construed as having any bearing on the relative rainfall even of
proximate stations, the rainfall of which will vary considerably according to

local circumstances.

Hence it will be seen that thepi-obable average at Seathwaite is 141 inches

                                                                            i2

Ainstead of 154, or 7 per cent. less.  similar, but generally less correction,

may be required for other stations. The figures in Table V. must not there-

fore be considered as showing the mean fall at the several stations, but only

as approximations generally pretty close. The data in our possession, if cor-

rected in accordance with the method explained, would afford more accurate

results, but the investigation is altogether beyond our present resources.

Large tracts of Ireland, and even of Scotland, are still without observers ;

much has recently been done to remedy these deficiencies, but there are still

many localities where observations are very much wanted ; we shall gladly

receive any off'ers of assistance from those who have residences or property in

Third Report on the British Fossil Corals. By P. Martin Duncan^

    F.R.S.f F.G.S., Professor of Geology in King's College, London.

--Introduction. There can be no doubt that the palaeontology of the Madrc-

poraria of the Palaeozoic strata is in a condition of profound confusion.

When these Reports were commenced, the veiy excellent descriptions and
classification of the Palaeozoic Corals by MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime,

strengthened by those of M. de Eromentel, appeared to have satisfied pa-
heontologists, and they were received and adopted without much demur.
But during the last three or four years a series of more or less important
attacks has been made upon the views of those distinguished authors
consequently opinions respecting many important matters in the palaeontology

of the Palaeozoic corals are in a very unsatisfactory state.

   L. Agassiz, A. Agassiz, and now Count Pourtales would remove the Ta-
bulata from the list of Madreporaria. Mr. Kent and I doubt the propriety

of establishing the Tabulata as a group. Count Keyserling demurred years
since at receiving the long se])taless Tubulata amongst the Madreporaria,
and, after due examination, I agree with him in relegating them to the Al-

cyonaria.

    Working amongst the Rugosa, I have shown that they do not invariably
characterize Palaeozoic strata, for some of the types have persisted, and no

reasonable doubt cau be entertained concerning the descent of the Jurassic

Coral-fauna fro'n the Palaeozoic.

    The genus Palceocyclns has been shown not to belong to the Fungidac,
but to the Cyathophyllidae. Genera with the hexameral arrangement of
septa have been found in Carboniferous and Devonian strata.

    Lindstrom's interesting researches respecting the operculated condition of

some Palajozoic corals require most careful study and much following up,

and the assertion of L. Agassiz respecting the hydroid relationship of those
Eugosa which have tabulae demands further inquiry *.

    Ludwig, of Darmstadt, has added to the confusion by not acknowledging
the received classification in the least ; and in his able enthusiasm (anti-

    * G-. Lindstrcim, pamphlet translated by M. Lindstrcim from the original Swedish,

' Geological Magazine,' 1866, p. 356. He notices tliat Guettard first described an oper-

culum in a rugose coral, and that then Steenstrup saw one in a Cyathophyllum mUratum.
Lindstrom produces evidence respecting the genera Gonlophylhim, Calceola, Zaphrcntis,
Hallia, and Favosites (see also p. 406 et seq.).
ON THE BKITISH FOSSIL COKALS.  117

 Gallican enougli) he alters generic and specific names, employing sesqui-
 pedalian Greek, and even absorbing the original authors (' Pateontogra-
 phica,' H. von Meyer, 1866).

    Thus he confuses Stromatopora concentrica, Goldfuss, Avith the Madre-
poraria, and calls it Lioplacocyathus concentricus. Fortunately Ludwig gives
 a plate of it (tab. Ixxii. fig. 1), and thus proves the total absence of all
structures which differentiate the Madreporaria. After thus dignifying a

rhizopod, we may be prepared for any thing.

    The same author figures a form which is clearly that of Heliolites porosa,
and calls it by the extraordinary name of Astroplucocyatlms solidus, Ldwg.
It appears that this naturalist studied this eminently cellular type from a
cast, hence the term solidus. Again, in tab. Ixxi. fig. 2, Liidwig delineates a
good specimen of Cyatlwphyllum hexagonum, Goldfuss, 1826, and with sur-

passing coolness names it Astroplilceothylacus vulyaris, Ldwg. He then con-
&founds a species oi Lithostrotion and Smithia Ifennali, E, H., in one genus,

Astrophloeocyclus, Ldwg.
   The student of the Silurian corals will be surprised perhaps to find that,

according to Ludwig, Hah/sites catenularia, Ed. & H., the Catenipora esclia-

roides of Lonsdale, is transformed into PiycJiophJcvohpas catenidaria, Ludwig,
doubtless on the principle that having found such a very distinguished generic

title, the compiler of it has the right to eclipse the discoverers of the form.
Chatetes, which some of us consider to belong to the Alcyonarian group, as

it has DO septa, Ludwig decorates with the title " LiopTdoeocyathus."
    In his sixty-ninth plate, fig. 5, there is a very good representation of a

coral ordinarily known as Accrvidana Troscheli, Ed. & H. This form was
inaccurately described by Goldfuss, who called it CyathopjhyUum ananas. Now
the authorship is settled by this Alexander, who cuts the knot by claimiug

the species as his own, under the title of AstrocJiarfodiscus ananas, Ludwig !
   Then Pleurodictyum prohUmaticum, Goldfuss, is altered into Tceniocharto-

cychis planus, Ldwg.
   To render matters easier to the student, Ludwig associates Acervidarla

liLvurians and Cyathophylhan helianfhoides in one genus, Astroblascodiscus,

and of course places his name after the species. Then CyathophyUum ccespi-
tosum becomes, under the same lexicographic hands, Astrocalanocyathiis
co'spitosiis, Ludwig I In another place CyatliophyJlum helianthoides, Gold-

fuss, just mentioned under the term Astrohlascodiscus, appears as Astro-

discus. Lonsdale's CystipTiylhim cylindriciim is turned into Liocyathus ca-

tinifer, Ldwg.

    This author, moreover, appears to hold a brief against the belief in the

quadrate arrangement of the septa in the Rugosa, and, in a manner which is
excessively arbitrary and artificial, terms such and such septa primaries, so
as to reduce the cycles to sixes. In spite of the evidence of great industry
given by Ludwig, I cannot accept his classification, nor do I find his hypo-
thetical septal readings consistent with facts. Nevertheless, Ludwig has
contributed to our knowledge of Permian corals, and has discovered some

species of genera hitherto supposed to characterize the Carboniferous forma-
tion in tlie Upper Devonian of German}'.

   The nature of this Ueport must therefore be very different to those already
presented to the Association. Those reports relating to the Corals of the
Mesozoic strata were essentiallj' founded upon observed facts, and upon data
which had been more or less before the geological world for years; the
generalizations embodied in them were established i;pon very satisfactory-
details. But in the present instance there is much uncertainty ; there are
118 REPORT 1871.

vast accumulations of details to be worked out without the existence of a
satisfactory classification, and, in fact, the whole subject of the Palaeozoic
Madreporaria is in too transitional a state for an exhaustive report to be made

upon them.
    In presenting this Report, therefore, I hope the Association will consider

that I have not yet completed my task, and that it will allow me to continue
my work and to present other reports when occasion offers. No fxirther

grant will be required, as the future reports will deal more with the results

of other labourers than with my own.

    The present Report is divided into four parts,
    I. The consideration of the alliances of the Neozoic and the Palaeozoic

Coral-faunas.

    II. The classification of the Perforata.
    III. The classification of the Tabulata.
    IV. The Eugosa.
    In order to avoid useless repetition of well-known facts, I have referred
to them by giving their bibliography, except when they are contained in

inaccessible works.

    I. The Palaeozoic corals of Great Britain have been the subject of many
admirable works ; they have been largely treated of in the ' Monograph of

the British Fossil Corals' (Palaeontographical Society) by MM. Milne-Edwards

 and Jules Haime, and by M'Coy in Sedgwick's great work. Phillips,
 Lonsdale, King, Sam. "Woodward, Parkinson, Martin, Fleming, Portlock,
 Sowerby, and Pennant have described species in their well-known works,
 and Kent, James Thomson, and I have contributed some information on

 the subject of the Scottish corals. But, with the exception of the labours of
 the last three persons, the literature of the Palaeozoic Corals will be found very
 accessible in the monograph already noticed ; any omissions, and a con-

 siderable number of new species will be published in my Supplement to that

 monograph, which I trust will appear year after year, especially as the

 Supplement to the Mesozoic Corals is now complete (Palasoutographical

 Society).

     The vertical range and the horizontal distribution of the species of corals

 have been worked out by llobert Etheridge, F.E.S., in a work which is now

 in course of publication (Cat. of Brit. Fossils).

    MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime classified the British Palaeozoic

 Corals amougst the sections Aporosa, Tabulata, Tubulosa, and Rugosa. The
 great section Perforata is not represented in the British strata, but it is in
 the equivalent American beds.

     The only representative of the Aporosa in their classification was one of
 the Fungidoe, Palceocyclus being the genus. It is a SUurian form, and no
 others of the family have been discovered in the other Palaeozoic rocks. The
 genus has been the subject of a memoir in the Philosophical Transactions,
 1867, where its rugose affinities are pointed out, and its cyathophyUoid na-
 ture also. But the Aporosa are nevertheless represented in the Devonian and
 Carboniferous rocks by the genera Battersby'm and Heterophyllia (Phil.

 Trans. 1867).

    The alliances of these forms and of some of the Rugosa with the Jurassic

 Coral-fauna have been noticed in my Supplement to the Brit. Foss. Corals

 (Pal. Soc), part "Liassic," and in the Essay in the Phil. Trans, of 1867*.

 is like that of Baiter&hyia grandis, nobis, and B. gemmans, nobi?, It is really nothing
ON THE BRITISH FOSSIL CORALS.                                                                                119

    I do not consider that the Tubulosa belonged to the Madreporaria, but
that they were Mcyonarians.

   It is very certain that some Aporose, Perforate, and Rugose corals have
tabulag, and that their existence cannot remove the forms from their re-

ceived zoological position into the separate section of Tabulata.

   Thus the well-known Aporose coral of the deep sea, Lopliohelia pro-

move, than portions of Stromatojiora which enclose the corallites and grow simultaneously
with them.

    I have altered the generic characters of Battershyia, in consequence of a careful exami-

--nation of the old and the two new species. It is as follows : Corallum fasciculate and

branching ; corallites tall, cylindrical, unequal in size and distance ; septa numerous and
following no apparent cyclical order.

   Endotheca very abundant : it is vesicular, and there are no tabulre. Epitheca, costa?,
and coenenchyma wanting. The wall is stout, and the septa spring from wedge-shaped
processes. The columellary space is occupied by vesicular endotheca. Gemmation extra-
calicular and calicular from buds having only five septa.

   There are three species :

Battersbyia  inrequalis,  I>uncan.             I  Devonian  Limestone
                                                                                                          ;

grandis, Duncan.                               \ found in pebbles,

gemmans, Duncan.                               J and not in situ.

In Battershyia gemmans the buds which develop more than five septa grow into coral-

lites, which are destined to bud again from the external wall, and the buds which de-

velop five septa produce other buds from their interseptal loculi ; the buds thus developed

resemble the corallites with more than thi-ee septa. This curious alternation of gemma-

tion has not been noticed in any other genus.

The genera Battershyia and Heterophyllia (Phil. Trans, he. cit.) have much in common.

They have a stout wall, a vesicular and dissepimental endotheca, delicate septa, very irre-

gular in their number, and neither tabular epitheca nor a quaternary septal arrangement.

The genus Batfcrsbyia has nothing to ally it to the Eugosa or the Tabulata. Hetero-

fhyllia lias in some of its species the solitary septum or vacancy whicli is so often observed

in the Cyathophyllida^. Its costal wall and endotheca connect it with the Mesozoic and

recent Astrseidoe.

   The singular septal development of Battershyia is witnessed in the fasciculate Liassic
Astrajidse. The pentameral arrangement of the Battersbyian septa is not unique, for
Acanthoeoenia Bathieri, D'Orb., of the Neocomian has only five septa, and so have the
species of Pentaccenia, all of which are from the same great formation. The proper Liassic
and some of the Lower Oolitic Thecosmiliaj and CalamophylUiB represent and are allied
by structure to Battershyia. The highly specialized characters of the Heterophyllise, espe-
cially of H. mirabilis, could hardly be perpetuated during great and prolonged emigra-
tions, so that the genus appears to be without representatives in the secondary rocks. Its

alliance to Battershyia, however, is evident enough.

   The genus HeterophylUa, MCoy, was examined by me in 1867, and the study of several

new species of it rendered a fresh diagnosis requisite.

   The following description of the diagnosis appeared in my essay on the genera Hetero-

phyUia, &c., already noticed:

   "The corallum is simple, long, and slender. The gemmation takes place around the
calicular margin, and is extracalicular. The septa are either irregular in number and
arrangement, or else are six in number and regular. The cost« are well developed, and
may be trabecular, spined, and flexuous. The wall is thick ; there is no epitheca, and the

endotheca is dissepimental."

   The genus may be subdivided into a group with numerous septa, and a group with six

septa.

   In the first the rugose type is faintly, and in the last the hexameral arrangement is well

observed.

   The dense wall and the dissepimental endotheca prove that the type of the Mesozoic
Coral-fauna was foreshown.

   The endotheca varies in quantity in the different species, and it resembles the tabular
arrangement ; but even when this is the ease and the cross structures are well developed
and numerous, they do not stretch over the axial space, so as to shut out cavities
as if they were floors ; they do not close in the whole of the visceral and interlocular

objectionable and improper proceeding to remove these genera from their

recognized alliances. I found an Astrcvopora in the Museum at Liver-

pool with tabula; ; and Mr. Kent has pointed out the perforate affinities of
Koninclcia and of the form he has published. Some Eugosse have perfect

tabula;, others have them not ; and in Ci/clojjJiyllum and Glisiophyllum dis-

sepiments exist in some parts of a corallum and not in others, where they

are replaced by tabulae. This interesting fact may be gleaned from James

Thomson's sections taken from the Scottish corals.

   JSTevertheless there are forms which are essentially tabulate, and not rugose,

but which, so far as their hard and septal structures are concerned, may

be aporose in one instance and perforate in another ; for instance, Cohwmaria

--and Favosites. These forms may still p»'ovisionalhj be considered Tabulata.
   Alliances. The Lower Cretaceous and Neocomiau corals appear to connect

the oldest and the newest faunas, and to form an excellent starting-point

both for the study of the Tertiary as well as for the Palasozoic forms. It

will be readily observed that the succession of genera and species from the

lower Cretaceous horizon to the present day is gradual ; and that although

many forms died out, still the general appearance of the consecutive faunas,

such as those of the Middle and Upper Cretaceous, the Nummulitic, the Oii-

gocene, the Miocene, the Pliocene, and of the two great faunas of the present

day, presents a remarkable similarity of Avhat is usually called " facies."

The similarity between the Lower Cretaceous fauna and that of the Miocene

has been treated of elsewhere *, and the analogies of the mid-tertiary corals

and those of the Pacific also. Moreover since the last Eeport was read the

distinction between reef, deep-sea, and littoral corals has been more satisfac-

torily established, and the reason why consecutive faunas upon the same

areas could not possibly be identical, even as regards the genera, has been

explained f.

   As the Coral-faunas are studied from those of recent date backwards in

time, extinct forms are met with which gradually fill up the spaces in the

very natural received classification, and it is perfectly evident that the existing

Aspecies were foreshadowed in the past.               great number of existing species

lived in the so-called Pliocene, and not a few in the Miocene %. Eeuss's

admirable researches amongst the vast reefs which are of an intermediate age

between the Flysch and the typical coral districts of the Miocene age, have

carried back the homotaxis of the existing coral areas to a time which has

hardly been recognized by British geologists, but whose fossils are clearly

cavities in a horizontal plane. In some species the dissepiments are curved, and are as
incomplete as when they are more or less horizontal in others, and vesicular endotheca
exists, more or less, in nearly all the forms.

   There are no true tabula^ and the dissepiments do not interfere in any way with the
jiassage of the septa from the lowest part of the corallum to the calice.

represented at Brockenhurst. In tlie great reefs of the Custcl-Gomberto

district there are the remains of a larger coral-fauna than that which now

exists in the Caribbean Sea ; and although a profound Plysch exists between
them and the reefs in the Oberburg distiict, indicating great oscillations of

the area and vast changes in the life of the time, still the genera which con-

tribute so largely to the formation of modern reefs are found represented in

abundance in the lowest reefs, which clearly belong to the Nummulitic period.

Our Eocene corals and those found at Brockenhurst are the stunted off-

shoots of the faunas which flourished at Oberburg and in the Vicentine, but

nevertheless some of their species are closely allied to those of much later

geological date.

Withoiit the assistance of the labours of Reuss and D'Achiardi zoophytolo-

gists could not have imagined that the well-known coral-faunas of the Hala

Mountains of Sindh, of the Nummulitic deposits of the Maritime Alps and

Switzerland, and of the London and Paris basins were but fractions of a

fauna which was probably richer in species than any modern coral tract ; and
this welcome aid proves the impropriety of neglecting foreign palaeontology,
even when writing reports like the present, and which treat of the produc-

tions of the rocks of a small area. The impossibility of comparing with any

satisfaction the Nummulitic coral-fauna and that of the Upper Chalk is
obvious ; because the NummuHtic fauna, so far as it is known to us, was

either a reef or a comparatively shallow-water one, whilst the corals of the

Upper Chalk were dwellers in a deep sea, where reef species cannot and

Wecould not exist.  must seek to compare the Upper Cretaceous corals with

the deep-sea forms of the Nummulitic, but unfortunately they are not yet

found*.

The Lower Cretaceous corals of Great Britain were the contemporaries of

the reef-builders of the Gosau and equivalent formations, and thus deep-sea

and reef species were contemporaneous, as they are at the present time, but they

were separated by wide distances. The comparison of the reef-fauna and that

of the deep sea is in this instance as futile as it would be at the present time
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

but we may compare the reef-fauna of Gosau with that of the Nummulitic,

Oligocene, Miocene, and existing reefs, and not without benefit and good

results, for there are persistent species which unite the whole together.

  A comparison may also be instituted between the deep-sea coral-faunas of

the Chalk and those which flourished at corresponding depths in the succeed-

ing geological epochs. Thus, thanks to Messrs. Wyville Thomson, Carpenter,
and Jeffreys, I have been able to assert the extraordinary homologies between

the deep-sea Cretaceous corals and those which now exist to the west of these
islands. These results are being published by the Zoological Society. The

present arrangement of coral genera in and about reefs was foreshadowed as
early as the Eocene, and such assemblages of genera existed in those old reefs as
would characterize the coral life of atoUs in the Caribbean Sea and in the raised
reefs of the Pacific Ocean. The genera Madrepora, Alveopora, Porites, Helias-
traa, and Millepora were represented in the Oberburg, and their species con-

stitute the bulk of existing reefs. It is important to be thus able, from the

labours of MM. Milne-Edwards, J. Haime, and Reuss, to determine the

existence of Perforate and Tabulate corals in the earliest tertiaries, for inter-

esting links are thus offered to the paleeontologist by which the older and
the newer faunas are connected. Such researches diminish the importance

of the break between the early Tertiary fauna and the present, and also, to a

certain extent, that between the Palaeozoic and recent faunas. Thus the find-
ing of species of the great Perforate genus Madrepora in the Oberburg
carries the genus a step further back than their discovery in the OHgocene
of Brockenhurst, and when taken into consideration with the presence of
the StephanophylUa, a perforate simple coral, in the Crag, Eocene, and Lower
 Cretaceous deposits, and with Actinads, a highly developed compound form,
in the Lower Cretaceous strata of Gosau, the immense break between the
next form of the family and the existing is materially diminished. The next
 form is not met with until the Carboniferous deposits of Indiana are reached

in a downward course ; and we owe to the late Jules Haime the knowledge

 of the structures of PaJceacis cimeiformis, Haime, MS., from Spurgeon Hill,
 Indiana. It is indeed remarkable that the vast eoralliferous strata which
 intervene between the Carboniferous and the Lower Chalk should not present
 a satisfactory proof of the existence of those members of the existing great

 reef-building family. There is a curious fact which may be taken for what

 it is worth in considering the absence of genera which have been represented
 in some ancient deposits and which have not been found in intermediate
 strata. Thus the existing West-India reefs contain abundance of the species
 of the genus Madrepora and Millepora ; indeed they, with the forms of

 Porites, constitute the bulk of the formations. Now, although Porites is
 common in the Miocene reefs of the area, the others are very rare, for the

 coral structures were principally composed of tabulate forms and Heliastra?ans.

 Yet we know that before the Miocene reefs flourished, Madreporae and MUle-
 pora) were common enough ; they were living all the while in other coral
 tracts. But the break between the Palaeozoic and the Lower Cretaceous forms

 cannot be bridged over without investigating the value of the classification
 which separates the most closely allied subfamily of the Perforata, although
 the Perforata are found in the Great Oolite.

     II. The Perforata characterized by a porous ccenenchyma and other tissues
 present many modifications of their hard parts. Some approach the Aporosa,
 and others would hardly be considered corals by the uninitiated on account of
 the sponge-like reticulations of the skeleton. The genus Madrepora is defined

 as follows by MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime :

     The coraUum is compound and increases by budding. The cojnenehj'ma
 is abundant, spongy, reticulate, slightly or not at aU distinguishable from
 the walls, which are very porous. The visceral chambers are subdivided by two
 principal septa, which meet by their inner margins, and are more developed

  than the others.
     The septa, especially the two largest, although perforated, are continuous,

  and very often lamellar.

    MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime distinguish the Poritidae in the fol-

  lowing manner :
     The coraUum is compound, and entirely formed of a reticulate ccenenchyma,

  which is formed of trabeculae and is porous. The corallites are fused
  together by their walls, or by an intermediate ccenenchyma, and they multiply
  by budding, which is usually extracalicular and submarginal.
^ The septal apparatus is always more or less distinct, but never completely
  lamellar, and is formed by a series of trabeculae, which constitute by their
  union a sort of lattice-work. The walls present the same structure as the
  septa. The visceral chambers sometimes have rudimentary dissepiments,
  but are never divided by tabulae.

      This family is divided into two subfamilies
      1. The Poritinae, with a rudimentary or absent ccenenchyma.
      2. The Montiporinae, with a well-developed ccenenchyma.
ON THE BRITISH FOSSIL CORALS.  123

   It will be noticed, when specimens of Montiporinse and Madreporse are

compared, that the distinction is in the absence of the two large and not
very perforate septa in the case of the first-mentioned group, and it is clear
that the excessively trabecular character of its septa, coenenchjma, and walls
is characteristic. Moreover the Montiporinae are recent forms.

   The genus Litharcea amongst the Poritinae approaches Madrepora, however,
and its septa are often so lamellar that they resemble those of some Helias-
traeans amongst the Aporosa. Here the distinction between the forms
becomes limited. The two great septa are not extended to the median line in
Litharcea, and there is scanty ccenenchyma, but still there is some. The colu-
mella of Litharcea is simply formed by the union of trabeculse from the septal

ends.

   Now Protarcea vetusta, Hall, and Protarcea VerneuiU, Ed. & H., Lower Silu-

rian corals from Ohio, only differ from the species of Litharcea by having more
aporosesepta and some coenenchymal protuberances*. It is necessary, however,
on account of the comparatively late appearance (so far as our investigations
has as yet gone) of Madrepora and Litharcea, whilst admitting the extraor-
dinary relation of the last-named genus to Protarcea, to examine another of

the Jurassic Perforata.

   The genus Microsolena of the Poritinao carries the excessively trabecular
type of the Poritinae as far back as the Great Oolite ; it is of course one of
the extreme forms, and most remote from Madrepora. It has more or
less confluent septa, and nothing like the styliform columella of Protarcea.
Thus Pcdceacis, a form of the Madreporinfe, and Protarcea, a typo of the
Poritinfe, are still unsatisfactorily disconnected by intermediate species vidth
their allies in the secondary rocks. Eut, on the other hand, it is something
to be able to show an anatomical connexion between the Protarcece of the
Lower Silurian and the Mierosolence of the Jurassic and of the Lithara'ce of the
Nummulitic rocks, and between Palceacis and the Turbinarians of the group
Madrepora, of which Actinacis is the oldest (Lower Chalk)t. It shows that
the reticulate or perforate corals existed amongst the first known eoralliferous
rocks, that the scheme of their organization has been perpetuated to the
present day through many kinds of variations, but with a great break, which
is owing to the imperfection of the geological record.

   III. The Tabulata, which form such large portions of many modern reefs,

were, as has been already noticed, in existence during the Miocene+, the
01igocene§, and the Eocene ||. They were, of course, not found amongst
the deep-sea deposits of the Cretaceous period, such, for instance, as our
White Chalk ; but Eeuss found the genera in the reefs of Gosau. Eeliopora
Partschi, Eeuss, sp. ; If. raacrostoma, Eeuss, sp. ; Polytremacis Blainvilleana';

P. hulhosa, d'Orb. : these are not uncommon in the reefs which were in

relation with the Hippurites, and the last coral genus lived during the
Eocene. Eeuss estabUshed a genus in 1854 for some compound, massive
corals, with prismatic corallites with thick imperforate walls. The calicos
are without radiating septa and have no columeUae. The tabulae are very
irregular, some being complete and others uniting obliquely with their neigh-
bours. The septa are represented by trabeculae. This Lower Cretaceous

genus he named StyJophyllum, and will be considered further on.

--124 REPORT 1871.

Pocillopora, so common a genus amongst the Indo-Pacific reefs, was found

in the West-India Miocene, the Javan deposits, and at Turin and Dax. It

is considered to be allied to Ccenites by Milne-Edwards, but Jules Haime

doubted the Zoantharian characters of the last-named genus, which is Palae-

ozoic. Seriatopora, a modern genus, does not appear to have been found
fossil ; but it is closclj' allied, according to the received opinion, with Rhab-
dopora, Dendrop>ora, and Traclinpora, all Palfeozoic genera, the first being

Carboniferous and the others Devonian. Millepora, the great reef-building
genus of the West Indies, can be traced into the Lower Tertiaries, and is

closely allied to the Heliopora already mentioned, and by structure to the

Heliolites of the Palaeozoic period.

Between the Lower Cretaceous reefs and the Palaeozoic there were the

Devonian, the Oolitic, the Lower Liassic, the Rhaetic, and the St. Cassian and

the Muschelkalk reef's, but not a trace of a tabulate coral has been recorded

from them, in spite of the affinities of the modern and most ancient genera

of the Devonian. Cyathopliora has tabulae, but its alliances are with the

myAstraeidfe. On examining the lists published in  last Eeport, the absence

of tabulate corals in the whole of the Mesozoic strata of Great Britain will be

apparent, and I have not been able to distinguish any foreign forms belonging

to that vast age (except our HoJocystis eJeguns, Ed. and H.), of which notice

wiU be taken in treating of the Rugosa and the species of Columnastnea.

Just as the Thecidae, Favositidas, and Halysitinac formed the reef-builders of

the tabulate fauna of the Palaeozoic times, so MiUeporidas and Seriatoporidae

contribute to the recent reef-fauna ; but these last genera had species in the

Palaeozoic fauna, so the break of the end of the Permian or Carboniferous
periods was not complete so far as the Tabulata were concerned. The ab-

sence of them from the successive secondary reefs that have been examined

by palaeontologists has probably been produced by the destructive fossilization

which is so common in existing reefs, and by the real absence of the forms

from certain reef-areas of which there is an example (see ' West-Indian Fossil

Corals,' Duncan).

The Tabulata were as abundant in the Palajozoic periods as during the

Tertiary epochs, and the ancient and modern genera and species have certain

characters which differentiate them more or less from all other coral forms.

 --MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime characterize the Tabulata as fol-

lows (Hist. Nat. des Corall. iii. p. 223) :
   The coraUum is essentially composed of a well-developed mural system, and

the visceral chambers are divided into a series of stages by transverse floors,

which act as complete diaphragms.

The septal apparatus is rudimentary, and is cither completely deficient or

only represented by trabeculae which do not extend far into the intertabular

spaces.

   The lamellar diaphragms, floors, or tabulae, which close the visceral
chamber of the coraUite at difl'erent heights, diff"er from the dissepiments of
the Astrffiidse by not depending in any manner upon the septa, by closing
completely the space below, for they stretch uninterniptedly from side to

side, instead of simply occupying the interseptal loculi.

   The septal apparatus does not affect the Rugose type, but that character-
istic of the Perforata and Aporosa. The forms classified under the section of
the Tabulata are very numerous, and hence the importance of determining

whether they can be undoubtedly allied with the rest of the Actinozoa.

   Many years have elapsed since Agassiz expressed his opinion, founded upon

direct observation, that the Milhporce, an important genus of the Tabulata,
ON THE BRITISH FOSSIL CORALS.  125

 were not Actiuozoa, but Hydrozoa, aud lately he has reasserted this state-
 ment. If MUlepora is one of the Hydrozoa, those tabulate forms which
resemble it in structure, such as Heliolites, must reasonably be asso-
 ciated with it in classification. The importance, then, of determining this

point is very great, and unfortunately it is accompanied by many difficulties.

Before proceeding to criticise Agassiz's remarks, it is necessary to examine
 the nature of the structures of the genera associated with MUlepora, or, in
fact, to review the classification of the Tabulata, and to note their affinities

with the other sections. Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime divide the Tabulata

--into four families : MiUeporidEe, Seriatoporidae, Favositidae, Thecidas.

    The principle upon which this classification is founded is philosophical and
natural to a certain degree. The first two families have more or less coenen-
chyma between the coraUites, and the last two have little or none, the co-
raUites being soldered together by their walls.

    The genus Pocillopora unites the two divisions, for it belongs to the Favo-
sitidae, and yet has a compact coenenchyma on the surface of the corallum.

    The classificatory value of the presence of coenenchyma in the whole of the

Madreporaria may be estimated by examining the scheme of MM. MUne-

Edwards aud Jules Haime.

   When treating of the Madreporidae (Hist. Nat. des Corall. vol. iii. p. 91),

they subdivide them into Eupsamminae without an independent coenenchyma,
Madreporince and Turbinarinae with a very abundant coenenchyma.

    The Poritidae they subdivide into the Poritinae without coenenchyma, and
the Montiporinae with an abundance of that structure in the spongy or

alveolar form.

   The EiiphyUiaceae (Ed. & H. op. cit. pp. 184 & 197) have such genera

as BarysmiUa and Dichocosnia, associated with Dendrogyra, Gyrosmilia, Pa-
chyr/yra, Rhipidogyra, which have or have not much cosnenchyma.

    The StylinaceaD are divided into independent, " empatees," aud agglomerate.
The independent genera have no coenenchyma; the " empatees" possess it in
the extreme so as to merit the term peritheca.

    The agglomerate have an excess of exotheca, but some genera are admitted
which are united by their walls, and are therefore without exotheca or coe-
nenchyma. Thiis PhyJIocosnia has an exotheca quite ccenenchymatous, and
Astroca'iiia has none. The corallites of Elasmoccenia have large mural ex-
pansions, and those of Aphccenia are soldered by their walls. Heteroccenia
and Pentaccenia present the same anomalies.

   The Astraeinae present such genera as ApJirastrcea and Septastrcea, the one
with and the other without extramural tissue, and Heliastrcea and Solenastrcea
with and Isastrcea without the same structure.

   It is then evident that the presence or absence of coenenchyma had difierent
significations in the estimation of the distinguished French zoophytologists.

    It is e%'ident that the structure of the corallites of Isastraeae and their defi-
ciency in coenenchyma in comparison with the Heliastraeae and Solenastraeae
cannot be of any very great organic significance ; for the coraUites of Heli-
astraeae occasionally grow so close together as to produce absorption of the
exotheca and costas, and the same occurs in the Astroccenife. The presence
of exotheca, peritheca, aud coenenchyma (for they are grades of a particular

structure) depends very much upon the habits of the corallum, and the notion

of teleology can hardly be separated from the consideration of this presence
a7id absence. Certainly to separate great groups by the presence or absence

of coenenchyma is not natural. It may be very useful to the classificatory

student, because the limitation qf forms is the prevaUing want; but it is not
126 REPORT 1871.

so to the biologist, for these mixed and unnatural limitations and separations

only form gaps in his argument, which require bridging over.

   The Favositidae and Thecidae, Palaeozoic forms, may then be separated, for

the pui'poses of classification, from the Milleporidae and Seriatoporidae, which

are almost aU post-Palaeozoic ; but this hmitation is not to impede the plain

course of the palaeontologist, who studies from a biological point of view
nor is it to stand in the way of the assertion, that the break between the

Palaeozoic and younger Tabulata is almost nil.

   The genus Millepora belongs to the Milleporidae, and the ccenenchyma of its
species is very abundant. It is of " a very irregular and spongy structure,

rather than tubular " (Ed. & H.), The cahces are of very different dimen-

sions on the same coraUum. There are no distinct septa, nor is there a

columella. The tabulae are horizontal. These are the diagnostics of the

Agenus according to Milne-Edwards and Jules Hame.  careful examination

of the calices of good specimens determines that the trabeciilae, of which the

ccenenchyma is composed, often projects into them, in the position of septa;

but there is nothing like the regular arrangement as seen in Heliopora, or

in the Poritidae of the Perforata. The cells of the ccenenchyma may occa-

sionally be seen to open into the space above the last tabula.

The absence of septa and this relation of the ccenenchyma to the gastric

space are most important. The tubular nature of much of the ccenenchyma

is evident, and longitudinal sections of some size prove that the spongy nature

of it is by no means constant nor uniform.

In Heliopora, belonging also to the Milleporidae, the ccenenchyma is very

abundant, and covered here and there with rounded pores arranged more or

less regularly and separated by papillose granules. These grains are the

extremities of cylindrical "tigelles" which circumscribe the tubules, the

calice of which is open at the surface. The calices are circular. The septa

are slightly developed, and there are twelve of them. The tabulae are well

developed and horizontal (Ed. & H.). The nature of the ccenenchyma and

the distinct septa distinguish this genus from the last. Both of the extinct

species have a papillose or striated structure running over the coenenchymal

surface. In all the species the septa do not project far into the calice ; but

the amount of projection is not sufficient, as a structural peculiarity, in any

case to determine more than a specific distinction. Hence MM. Milne-

Edwards and Jules Haime when they separate, in their scheme of the Millepo-

ii^yd* , Millepora and Heliopora and other genera ivova. Hcliolites, Propora,

and Lyellia, the particular Palaeozoic genera, they can only be permitted to do

so on the plea that the plan renders the genera readily distinguishable. The

projection or non-projection is not sufficient to determine a generic difference.

   Now Heliolites has a beautiful ccenenchyma, very geometric, and not irre-

gular and spongy ; its cellules are placed regularly and symmetrically. In

most of the species the septa are distinct, and project far inwards, but in

Heliolites Orayi they are almost rudimentary,

' The genus Pohjiremacis hnks Heliolites and Heliopora together, for its

ccenenchyma is that of the second, and the septa resemble those of the first-

named genus. Polytremacis is not older than Heliopora in the secondary

ages, and the septal distinction which cannot expel Heliolites Grayi from

its genus, and which is improperly allowed to distinguish Polytremacis and

Heliopora, and these and Heliolites, may well have been produced by varia-

tions in a succession of early secondary forms.

The septal development of Heliolites is exaggerated in Propora, a genus

from the Upper Silurian, and which perhaps lasted into the Carboniferous.

The costaj in this genus are well developed, but the ccenenchymal cells are

less geometric than in Heliolites. The structural relations are of the closest,

and the generic distinction is not of the usual generic value. Another

Upper Silurian genus, Lyellia, represents these symmetrical Milleporidse

in America. The corallite walls are subcostulate and not so costulate as in

Propora. The septa (12) are well developed, as in Heliolites and Propora and

--Heliopora, and the coenenchyma is perfectly vesicular spongy, in fact, like

Heliopora. Here, then, in the distant and British and Northern European

Silurians, there were closely allied forms varying amongst themselves, but

more than the secondary types, the variation having some sort of likeness in

both instances. It is impossible not to acknowledge the genetic affinities of

all these genera except Millepora, of which more will be said, or to hesitate

to assert that there has never been a break in the Tabulata, and that the Ee-

cent and Palaeozoic Heliopora and Heliolites are very closely allied, the one

being the descendant of the other*. Axopora is a tertiary genus, and its

immense columella, which fills up the corallite inferiorly and leaves but little

room in the calice around it, of course prevents the tabiilae from reaching

across the axial space. The tabulae come in contact with but do not perfo-

rate the columella, so that this structure grows progressively without any

reference to them ; they do not form floors upon which a columella is deve-

loped f. There are no septa, and the coenenchyma is reticulate in the ex-

treme. No living analogue of this genus exists, and exception may be taken

whether it be a true coral. It has no Palasozoic representatives.

   Battershyia is a very remarkable Palaeozoic genus, and has been examined

by me+. MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime§ classify it with the Mil-

leporidaj, but apparently only provisionally ; but it will be noticed elsewhere.

I have associated Battershyia and Heterophyllia together as a new division

of the Aporosa of the Astraeidae, under the name of the Palastraeaceae, which

are noticed in the first part of this Eeport.

  The Eavositidae are divided by MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime into

the following subfamilies : Eavositinae, Chaetetinae, Halysitinae, PociUoporinae.

--All are presumed to present the following family characteristics : " The

corallum is formed essentially of the lamellar walls of the coraUites, and

possesses hardly any or no coenenchyma. The visceral chambers are divided

by tabulfe, which are numerous and well developed."

The subfamilies without any coenenchyma, and those whose coralHts fonn a

massive corallum, are the Eavositinae and the Chastetiase, and the genera whose

corallites are not united on all sides the Halysitinae. The Pocilloporinfe

constitute the ccenenchymal subfamily. One of the great difliculties of the

zoophytologist appears strongly enough whilst investigating these Tabulata, for

the question constantly arises, and can only be answered very unsatisfactorily,
are such and such forms really Actinozoa? are they not Polyzoa, Hydrozoa,
or of some class which has become extinct, and which has no modern repre-

sentatives ?

   Some genera are characterized by the absence of septa. Thus Chcetetes
has long basaltiform coralKtes, numerous tabulae which do not correspond in

their- plane throughout the coraUum,. no septa, and the reproduction is fissi-

parous.                                                                            I

 128 REPORT 1871.

     Keyserling considered the genus to belong to the Alcyonaria amongst the

 Actiuozoa ; but MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime, considering the great

 analogj- between Chcetetes aud Favosites, and particularly with. Beaumontia,
 " ou la presence de cloisons n'est pas contestable"*, determined its position
 to be amongst the true Tabulata.

    The same authors now recognize the necessity of separating Chcetetes from
 Monticulipora, and assert that the members of the last-named genus increase

 by gemmation.
     The genus Dania differs from Chcetetes in having the tabulae on regular

 planes which traverse the whole coraHum. This peculiarity is hardly of

  generic value.

     Stellijjora (Hall) is not generically different from Monticulipora, and the
 truth of this assertion can be estimated by comparing the diagnosis of the

 genera given by MM. Mibie-Edwards and Jules Haime f.
    The differentiation of Delcayia (Ed. & H.) J and of Lahechia is also unsatis-

 factory, aud their more or less mamraillated ccBnenchyma ranges them together
 by the side of Stellipora as subgenera of Monticulipora.

\

    Now Jiiles Haime, when investigating the Oolitic Polyzoa, classified forms

 without septa and with tabulae, hke Chcetetes or Monticulipora, as Polyzoa,
  and the beautiful Stelliporce were especially included.

    Now the question arises, are there any recent Polyzoa whose soft parts

 have been examined that have tabulaj ? From our knowledge of the recent

  Polyzoa, it is unsafe to answer this in the affirmative. There is a freshwater
  species which is said to have tabulas, but the assertion requires confirmation.
 The classification, then, of these forms amongst the Polyzoa must be deferred,
  and I propose to decide against it now.

  --Beaumontia, the genus noticed above, is distinguished by MM. Milne-

 Edwards and Jules Haime § as follows : " This genus is distinguished from
  all other Chaetetiuffi by the formation of its tabuliie, which are irregular or
 vesicular, and it thus resembles Michelenia, belonging to Favositinae." The
  presence of septa belonging to three cycles is asserted by the same authors,
  and this fact must remove the genus quite out of the neighbourhood of septa-

  less forms.

     The genera of the Cheetetiuce were formerly Chcetetes, Monticulipora, Dania,
  Stellip)ora, Dekayia, Beaumontia, and Lahechia. It has been shown that
  Stellipora, Delcayia, and Lahechia are subgenera of Monticulipora, that Dania
  cannot be separated from Chcetetes, and that Beaumontia has no correct affinity
  with the others, and that it belongs to another family.

     The genera should stand thus :

                          Chcetetes. Subgenus Dania,
                           Monticulipora. Subgenus Stellipora.

                                                                        ,, Delcayia.

                                                               ,, Lahechia,

But the subgeneric names should be dropped.
   This result is interesting because it eliminates Beaumontia and makes a

compact sei'ies, the affinities of which are not Polyzoan, but which may be

Alcyonarian or Hydrozoan.

and their more or less horizontal and perfect tabulae, recall the Tubiporiuoc
amongst the order of the Alcyonaria.

   The Alcyonaria are Actinozoa which are separated by MM. Milne-Edwards

and Jules Haime from the Zoantharia on account of the pinnate structure of
the tentacles, and from these important organs being invariably eight in

number.
   The zoantharian tentacles, on the contrary, are simple or irregularly rami-

fied, and increase in number with age.
   The Alcyonaria are divided into the families of the Alcyonidee, the Gorge-

nidae, and the Pennatulidae.
   The first two families have an adherent corallum, and the last consists of

free forms.

   The Alcyonidae have no hard central axis, but this characterizes the

Gorgonidffi.

   Now the Cornularinse, Telestingg, and Alcyoninas, subfamilies of the Alcy-

nidae, are clearly allied to the Tubiporina; by their soft structures ; but the
hard external structures of this subfamily are only faintly shown in the spi-
culate scoi'iaceous conditions of the external tegument of NejjJithya, Spoggodes,
and Paralcyonium. The polypes oi JSfejjMii/a and Paralcyonium enter their

spiculate and dense external covering when they contract; but the hard

structures of S^oggodes celosia, Lesson, are very slightly developed.

                                       TuBiPOEA (pars), Linnaeus.

    Tuhipora, Lamarck.

  The genus has been examined by MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime

with their usual care and acumen.

   The specimens of Tuhipora are so common that the descriptions of these

authors concerning the hard parts of the corallum can readily be followed.
   The coraUitcs are formed principally by a tabular waU, the tissue of which

is calcareous and readily fractured. There are no septa, but there are ru-
dimentary tabulas, which cut off the visceral cavity into more or less perfect
stages. The corallites arc cylindrical, and usually attain an equal height
but they do not touch each other, for they are united by a peritheca, which
is only seen here and there in distinct floors. The budding takes place
from the connecting peritheca, which is therefore a true coenenchyma, and

not like that of Solenastrcea. Were the corallites in contact the appearance

of Chcetefes would be presented ; so that the presence of the coenenchyma is
the differentiating structure. It is only of generic value, and thus there is '
a very strong reason for associating the Chsetetinee and all the other fossils
with long tubular structures, no septa, and tabulae with the Alcyonidae in the
subfamily Tubiporinse and near the genus Tubijjora. These retaarks are
subject, of course, to the consideration whether the views of Agassiz already

noticed are correct.

    Keuss's genus Styhphyllum (Gosau Chalk) cannot be associated with the
Alcyonidee, for the species has septa. The corallites are united by their
walls without there being a coenenchyma, and tlie walls are imperforate. The
junction of the corallites takes place by means of an epitheca.

   The junction may occur at any part of the corallito.
   The resemblance of StyhphyUum to some of the Halysitinte (Ed. & H.)*

necessitates an examination of their structural peculiarities.

130 REPORT 1871.

  MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime differentiate the Halysitinse as

follows :

   "The corallum is compound, but its corallites unite imperfectly, and

constitute lamellar expansions or long fasciculi ; they are either free on two
sides, or arc united together by ' ea-pansions murales.' "

    The septa are small, but usually very distinct ; finally the walls are well
developed and aporose.

    The genera are : Hah/sites, Fischer ; Syringopora, Goldfuss ; Tliecostegites,

Ed. & H. (Ilarmodites, Michelin) ; &Conostefjitcs, Ed. H. ; Fletcheria, Ed.

&H.

Hall/sites. The species are invariably formed by corallites which are joined
        on two sides, and which in transverse outline resemble links of a chain.
       The epitheca is very strong, and unites the corallites perfectly where
        they are in contact from the base to the calice. Septa 12. Tabulas
        horizontal and well developed. (Silurian.)

Thecostegites. The corallites have septa, horizontal tabulae, and an exotheca
        unites them, and it is more or less tabular in structure, and exists in
       stages like the Tuhipora. In 'T, pm-mda the ccenenchyma is nearly

         compact. (Devonian.)

 C'onostegites. There are numerous septal s-trise, which mark also the smooth
        and convex surfaces of the tabula). The tabulte are more or less infun-
        dibuliform, and the epitheca unites the corallites hero and there.

Byringopora. The coraUum is fasciculate ; the corallites are cylindrical and
        very long, parallel, and free laterally, except where horizontal tubes
        connect them. The walls are well developed, and clothed with a strong
        epitheca ; septa exist. The tabula) are infundibuliform.

Fletcheria. The corallum is fasciculate ; the corallites are cylindrical, close,
        and long. The epitheca is complete ; septa exist. Tabulae horizontal

       and well developed. No intcrcorallite tubes or expansions of epitheca.

        Gemmation calicular.
     It is evident that some of these genera are very slightly allied ; for in-
 stance, Syringopora and Fletcheria, and both of them and Halysites.
     Halysites, with its stout epitheca and simple tabulae with non-tubular

 joints, is a very definite form.

     Thecostegites should belong to the Milleporidae.
     Conostegites, with infundibialiform tabulae, is related to Halysites as Miche-

 linia is to Favosites.

      Fletcheria is altogether aberrant.

     The Halysitince comprehend, according to this analysis, Halysites, Fischer

 Btylophyllmn, Eeuss ; Conostegites, Ed. & H.

     The genera Syringopora and Fletcheria will be considered further on.
     The subfamily of the Pocilloporinae contains the genera Pocillopora and

  Ccenites.

    Pocillopora has septa (and my specimens show 12), which, even in fossil

 specimens, mark the top of the tabulae. There is a columellary swelling on
 its tabula). The ccenenchyma is very stout and thick in old portions of the
 corallum, less so where growth has just ceased, and the ccenenchyma barely
 exists where the corallites or calicos are developing. It is cellular at first,
 and then fills up with calcite and other coral salts.

     Fossil forms have been described by Eeuss and myself from the Cainozoic

  formations.

      Ccenites resembles Pocillopora in a certain density of its ccenenchyma, but

 differs in only having three tooth-liko septa, like the genus Alveolites.
                   ON THE BRITISH FOSSIL CORALS.               131

The number of septa and the habit of growth of the two genera separate

them very widely ; and the propriety of connecting the last-named one with

the MUleporidse must be considered.

There are four genera in the family of the Seriatoporidte : Seriatopora,

Dendropora, JRhahdopora, Trachypora.

The family is characterized by the continual growth of the lower parts of

the corallites and the rarity of tabulte.
   Seriatopora is a recent genus, and therefore those associated with it must

be carefully examined.

Dendropora, Michelin, is clearly too closely allied to Bhahdopora to be

separated generically.

  Rhahdopora, formed for the Dendropora megastoma, M'Coy, by MM. MUne-

Edwards and Jules Haime, has only one species, the diagnosis of which is as

follows :

 --Rhahdopora megastoma, M'Coy, sp. The corallum is branching. Branches

four-sided, starting from the stem at an angle of 70°, and very equal. Coe-

nenchyma granulated or subechinulated and obscurely striated. Calicos in

vertical series on each face of the branches. Septa (teeth) 12 in number and

subequal.

It is impossible to separate this from Seriatopora, for the four-sided suture

of the branches is only a specific (if that) distinction.

Trachypora appears to be an Alcyonarian.

The distinction between PociUopora and Seriatopora is not generic, and

therefore these genera and Dendropora (for Dendropora and Rhahdopora

are equal, and the first name is the oldest) are absorbed in one. Oken'a
name Acropora (1815) may be used as the generic term : Acropoea
{Seriatopora, Lamarck ; PociUopora, Lamarck ; Dendropora, Michelin ; Rhah~

dopora, Ed. & Haime).

   All the species of the absorbed genera should take the generic name of

Acropora, and the family becomes that of the Acroporinaa. Thus the sharp

distinction between the recent and Palaeozoic forms is partly smoothed down,

and the old Dendroporre and Rhabdoporge were doubtless the ancestral

forms of the recent Acroporse. Ccenites cannot be associated with the

family.

The family of the Thecidese is characterized by well-formed septa, which

are prolonged throughout the visceral chamber, well-developed tabulae, which

grow like dissepiments upon the sides of the septa, and these last do not

spring from the upper surface of the tabiilse, as in some Tabulata. The walls

are solid, compact, and united.

The corals contained in the family are all Silurian forms, so far as is

known at present.
   Thecia, Ed. & Haime. It is a most remarkable fact that this genus, the

species of which have no true wall, but a dense ccenenchyma between septal

prolongations or costa?, should here give the family name. Tliecia Siuinder-

niana, Goldfuss, sp., has been called ^(7«nc?'a, Porites, Astreopora, and PaJceo-

pora by different authors, so that its classificatory position may well be a

matter of doubt. It is not in the least allied to Columnarife, which has soHd

walls, and which fulfils all the characteristics of the Thecidaj.

   In Thecia, Ed. & H., there is a long visceral cavity surrounded by a dense

tissue, as in Mtllepora, through which the septa, or rather the costa, run.

   What is the structure of Plasmopora and Propora but that of Thecia

slightly modified. The genus clearly must be associated with them amongst

the Milleporidip.

132 REPORT-- 1871.

    Columnaria is a fine form ; the great septa (12 to 18) and tabulae, with
the compact walls, distinguish it at once. Col. alveolata is a Lower SHuriau

Cform, GotMandka is Upper Silurian. It is a most important genus, and

its affinities will be noticed.
    The Favositidse have a massive corallum without ccenenchyma, septa, and

perforate walls ; that is, there are openings which permit the visceral cavity
of one coraUite to communicate with that of another in several places. The

foUovsdng genera are included by MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime :

Favosites, Emmonsia, MicJielinia, Roemeria, Koninchia, Alveolites.
    Favosites is the typical genus. In some species the mural foramina are

scanty in number, in others numerous ; and they are even in relation with

the angles of the wall, especially in F. alveolar is.

    The earliest species of the genus are Lower Silurian, for instance : F. Qoth-
landica, F. multipora, F. aspera, F. Forbesi (which ranges through to the
Upper Silurian), and F. fibrosa (having the same vertical range, and is found
as a Devonian fossil).

    F. Hisingeri has the same range as F. fibrosa. F. cristata and F. cervi^
cornis are the same, and the range is from the Upi^er Silurian of England
to the Devonian of Russia.

    The species which are Devonian, and do not range above or below, are :

 F. Goldfussi, F. basaltica, F. polymorp'ha, F, alveolaris, F. pedicidata, F. Tclii-

TiatcheJJi, and F. niammillaris. The only known Carboniferous Favosites is

F. parasitica, and it is a degenerate form.
    F. Oothlandica has rounded processes encircling the mural pores, and the

 projections formed upon one fit against those of the neighbouring corallite.
 F. multipara has three vertical series of pores, and its walls are almost as per-
 forate as some Alveoporte.

    The tabulae are almost universally horizontal in the lavosites, but some are
 wavy in their course ; and the septa are a series of vertical spines which vary
 in size according to the cycle, and are often referable to three cycles in six
 systems. In some there is a faint columellary swelling on the tabula?.

    A careful examination of the species proves that the earliest known forms

 are as highly developed as the Devonian, but that the sj^eciea parasitica is

 dwarfed.

     Emmonsia has imperfect tabula;. The tabulae are vesicular at the sides,
 or dissepimental, and they communicate more or less with each other.

     Roemeria has infundibuhform tabulas, and the species is Devonian.
     Koninckia is an Upper Cretaceous form ; it has thin and nearly horizontal

 tabulae, thiu walls very much perforated, and six series of large spiny septa.

     Michelinia has irregular and vesicidar (dissepimental) tabulae, and simple
 striae for septa (Devonian and Carboniferous). The alliance of Michelinia,
 Roemeria, and Emmonsia is very evident. Mr. Kent has written a most

 interesting description of Favositipora (Kent), Ann. & Mag. Nat. Hist. 1870,

  vol. vi. p. 384, which unites the Favositiuae and the Favositidae.
     Alveolites ofi'ers the same objection to being united to i^rtvosjV^s that Cten? to

  does to PociJlopora ; in fact Alveolites is a Coenites with perforated walls,
  and it is proposed to deal with both genera by disassociating them from their
  recognized families.

      Biiringopora I propose uniting with the Favositida?, as it has tubular
  connexions between the visceral centres of the corallites, which are fore-
  shadowed in F. Gotldandica.

       After this analysis of the TabiJata, it is necessary to state the opinions of

  Prof. Agassiz respecting their Hydrozoau characteristics.
             ON THE BRITISH FOSSIL CORALS.                                  133

Prof. Agassiz (senior) writes as follows in the ' American Journal of Science

and Arts,' 2nd series, vol. xxvi. p. 140, N'ovember 1858 :

" The animals of Millepora are Hydroid Acalephs and not polyps ;" that

is to say, they are Hydrozoa and not Aetinozoa. The resume of several letters
to Dana is given at the same place. ''I have seen," writes Agassiz, "in

the Tortugas something very unexpected. Millepora is not an actinoid polyp

biit a genuine Hydroid, closely allied to Hydractinia. This seems to carry

the whole group of Favositidte over to the Acalephs, and displays a beautiful

array of this class from the Silurian to this day."

Dana adds a note to this statement. " The drawings of Professor Agassiz

which have been sent us for examination are so obviously Hydractiuian in

most of their characters that no one can question the relation. With re-

gard to the reference of all the FavositidtB (a group including Favosiies,

Fenestella, PociUopora, &c., as well as the minuter MiUejJora, Chcetetes, &c.)

to the Acaleph class, direct evidence is not yet complete, as the animal of the

Pocilhpom has not been figured by any author on zoophytes. Prom the

specimens of the species of this genus which I procured in the Pacific, I never

obtained a clear view of the polyps, and hence made no figure. The brief

description on page 523 of my Report may be reasonably doubted until con-

firmed by new researches. The much larger cells in Pocillopora, FavosiUs,

and Fenestella than in Millepora, and the frequently distinct rays in these

cells, are the characters I had mentioned to Prof. Agassiz as suggesting a

doubt as to their being Acalephs, and to this what follows above relates."

Agassiz observes, in a subsequent letter, after observing that the Sidero-

porffi obviously are polyps, " There are two types of radiating lamelte which

are no£ homologous. In true polyps (excluding Favositidas as Hydroids) the

lamella} extend from the outer body-waU inward along the whole height of that

wall, and the transverse partitions reach only from one lamella to the other,

so that there is no continuity between them, while the radiating lameUte

are continuous from top to bottom in each cell. In Milleporidse the partitions

are transverse and continuous across the cells ; so are they in Pocillopora and

in all Tabulata and Eugosa ; while the radiating lamella?, where they exist,

as in Pocillopora and many other Favositida), rise from these horizontal

floors, and do not extend through the transverse partitions ; indeed they are

limited within the spaces of two successive- floors, or to the ujiper surface of
Atlie last.
             careful comparison of the corallum of Millepora and Pocillopora

with that of Hydractinia has satisfied me that these radiating partitions of

the Favositida?, far from being productions of the body-wall, are foot-secre-

tions, to be compared to the axis of the Gordonia corallum &:c., and their

seeming radiating lamellae to the vertical groove or keel upon the surface of

the latter, which, reduced to a horizontal ijrojeetion, would also make the

impression of radiating lamellas in the foot of the polyp. If this be so, you

see at once that apparent radiating lamellae of the Favositidte do no longer

indicate an affinity with the true polyps, but simply a peculiar mode of
growth of the corallum ; and of these we have already several types, that of

Actinoids, that of Alcyonoids, that of Bryozoa, that of Millepora, and other

corallines, to which we now add that of Hydroids. Considering the subject

in this light, is there any further objection to uniting all the Favositida? with

the Hydroids ? Sideropora and Alveopora being of course removed from the

Favositida;. It is a point of great importance in a geological point of vicAv,

and for years I have been anticipating some such result, as you may sec by

comparing my remarks in the ' American Journal,' May 1854, p. 315. If all

the Tabulata and Eugosa are Hydroids, as I believe them to be, the class of
--134 KEPORT 1871.

Aealephs is no longer an exception to the simultaneous appearance of all the

types of Radiata in the lowest fossiliferous formations, and the peculiar cha-

racters which these old Hydi-oid corals present appears in a new and very

instructive aspect."

   A. Agassiz includes the Tabulata amongst the Hydrozoa. He notices

" that the absence of radiating partitions in the Tabulata seems to show
without much doubt that their true place is among the Hydroids." It is

true that Prof. Agassiz has not observed the Medusa-buds on the specimens

he has figured, yet the Hydroid character of the animal and their similarity to

I[aIochcens-]ike Hydroids is very striking (Havard Catalogue, 1865, p. 219).

   Prof. Alexander Agassiz informs me that his father still holds these opinions,
and that new researches have satisfied him about the correctness of the

di'aAvings which have been lately reproduced. '·' MiUeiJora is not an actinoid

polyp, but a genuine Hydroid, closely allied to H)jdractinia."

This very strong expression of opinion is founded iipon the appearance

presented by the polyps of Millepora cdcicornis, the drawing of which has

been reproduced by A. Agassiz. Now the distinction between the Actinozoa

and the Hydrozoa is well marked ; in the first the generative apparatus is

included in the gastric and perigastric cavities, and in the last the digestive

and generative organs are perfectly apart. Every variety of tentacular and

disk apparatus may exist in either, but the external development of the gem-

mules, ova, and embryonic forms must be recognized before any Coelenterate

animal can be associated with the Hydi'ozoa.

Here is the point at which Agassiz faUs. His researches are only sug-

gestive, until the generative organs are recognized on the protruded polypes

of Millepora, and until the mesenterico-ovarian layers are proved not to exist
within the cahces. The external resemblance of the Milleporc polypes to the

sterile Hydractinia is evident.

The remarks upon Pavositidse, Sideropora}, and other genera, made by

Agassiz in consequence of the assumption that Mdlepora is Hydrozoan, are of

doubtful value ; and I must refer back to my analysis of the Tabulata to show

how a confused classification between both classes imperils research. Sidero-

A2)ora is not a tabulate form even.  careful examination of Columnarla satis-

fies me that Agassiz's description of the lamellae fails in that genus ; and inas-

much as the wavy lines of Gorgonia and CoraUium are connected with the water

system of the species, they can have no possible relation with the radiate
 amellfe or groovings of the MiUeporan calices. The homologucs of the grooves

are the depressions and irregular interstriatcd portions on top of the ccenen-
chyma between the calices in the Tabulata.

   The perforate walls and the septa of the true Favositidae seem to remove

them from the range of the remarks of Agassiz, which may well deserve

attention, so far as Millepora is concerned, for it is a genus with^ marked
distinctions from all other corals.

   It is not reasonable to include the Rugosa, because some of them have no
tabulic, and others have them so much like dissepiments, or associated with
dissepiments, that we are impressed with the unimportance of the differen-

tiations established by the presence of horizontal tabukic!.

    It is most important that the minute structure of the MiUeporidae should
be thoroughly investigated, and any report on the Palaeozoic corals must be
very incomplete -ndthout a detailed description of its study.

ordinarily occupied by a series of tabulra or vesicular endotheca, and tbc
eudotheca often occupies the greater part of the corallum. The septal
laminfc, although generally very incomplete, arc never perforated or ' pou-
trellaire ; ' finally, their lateral faces are not furnished with synapticulse, and

are only rarely granular.

   " The individual corallites increase by gemmation, and never by fissiparity.

The buds are generally calicular, and this form of gemmation may continue

in the same individual. In some cases the gemmation is lateral."
    The originators of the " Rugosa" divide them into four families :

1. Stauridffi.     3. Cyathophyllidas.
                   4. Cystiphyllidse,
2. Cyathosonidge.

   In criticising this classification some definite plan must be adopted, which
should refer to the philosophy of the classification of the Aporosa and Per-
forata. In fact the scheme of generic subdivision and differentiation adopted
in the Neozoic corals can be made to apply to those of the Palceozoic age.
Thus an essential distinction is made amongst the Neozoic corals by the
simple or compound nature of the corallum. Simple Caryophyllinse constitute
a series of genera, and the compound forms are separated as Ccenocyathi.

Now in the Paltcozoic genus CijafJiojjJu/Ihun, MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules

Haime admit, in direct opposition to the Neozoic scheme, both simple and
compound forms. This, I think, is an error, but only an error of classifica-

tion, for there can be no reasonable doubt of the intimate genealogical

relation of the simple and compound genera of Ct/athophyllum,

                                                         Families *.

 --1. SiATJEiDiE. Genera: Siauria, Hohcystis, Polyccelia, Metrio][jliyllum,

Conosmilia.

   Of these Ilolocystis is a Lower Greensand form, and Conosmilia is Austra-
lian and Tertiary.

   MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime place the Stauridse first in their

list of families ; but it would have made the classification more simple if the
second family took their place ; and I propose to change the order of arrange-

ment, but proceed at present in the recognized method.
    There is a well-developed wall in the Stauridaj ; the septa are continuous

from the top to the bottom of the calico, and are eminently quaternary in
their arrangement. The endotheca assumes the vesicular structure between
the septa, and then crosses over in the form of horizontal tabulps. The
Staiiridaj approach the CyathophyUidaj more than the Cjathoxonidae ; and,
indeed, the only essential distinction between the first two families is in the
truly lamellar state of the septa in the first instance, and in the incomplete
condition of them in the second. Nevertheless it should constitute a family

distinction.

   Two of the Stauridian genera are compound, and three arc simple forms.

    Stauria, which as yet has not been found in British strata, has neither colu-
mella nor costa?, whilst Hohcystis has both of these structures. There is no

reason why the last-named genus should not be the lineal descendant of the

former. Both were probably shallow-water forms in the neighbourhood of

 reefs.

    The simple forms Conosmilia and Poh/ccelia are closely allied, and the
presence of the first in the Australian Tertiaries, and of the other in the Euro-

pean Pcrmiau, is highly suggestive. The remaining form, lletriojjhT/Uum,
offers a great difficulty, for if the received classification be adopted, the genus
is very aberrant. Thus 3Iefr{o2)hi/Uum has not four principal septa, but the
septa are arranged in four groups, a gap or kind of septal fossula being be-

&tween each gToup. The British Devonian species (M. Battershiji, Ed. H.)

was founded upon a transverse section of a slab, and therefore the entire
nature of the septa could hardly he determined. The question arises at once,

what do those septal fossute mean? And another follows very naturally, are

they in relation with the primary septa ?

    I think that they denote a difference in the physiology of the polype, for
they would permit of a deeper development of the visceral cavity and an

enlarged condition of the ovarian apparatus. Moreover, these fossulaj may
have much to do with the growth of the coral in calibre and in septal num-

ber ; and, furthermore, Lindstrom's admirably suggestive paper on the oper-

culated structures, necessitates much attention being paid to them. Can

there be any genealogical classification which will connect in one family
such different forms as MetriojpliyUum and Pohjcxelia ? I think not.

   Eliminating, then, MetriophyUam from the Stauridaj, I propose to permit
the genus to remain per se for the present.

   This group has no endotheca, and resembles the TurbinolidoB amongst the

   All the forms are simple. Cyathoxonia preceded the others, and all are
closely allied. The foreshadowing of the Neozoic forms in the Palteozoic
Cyathoxonidse is evident enough.

Re]}ort on the Heat generated in the Blood during the process of

   Arterialization. By Arthur Gamgee^ M.D., F.R.S.E., Lecturer on

    Physiology in the Extra-Academical Medical School of Edinburgh.

In a Report which was submitted to the British Association in Liverpool
last year*, I very shortly alluded to the objects which I had in view in com-
mencing an investigation on the very obscure subject of the heat generated

during the arterialization of blood.

    I pointed out that two methods of research suggested themselves as likely
to elicit facts which would lead to a solutioii of the problem, and I stated
that both these methods had been employed by previous observers.

   The first method, which would at first sight appear likely to furnish us
with most important data, consists in ascertaining the temperature of the

blood in the right and left ventricles of the heart of living animals. If our
methods of experimenting were free from the great fallacies which are in-

troduced when we are compelled to interfere, in a serious manner, with the

central organ of the circulation, and if it resulted that the left side of the

heart contained blood warmer than that of the right side, we should be driven

to the conclusion either that during the process of absorption and combina-
tion of the oxygen of the air a very perceptible evolution of heat had oc-

                                   * Eeport of the Liyerpool Meeting, p. 228.
--138 KEPOHT 1871.

curred, or that within the pulmonary vessels considerable oxidation processes
of the blood contained in them had taken place. If, on the other hand, the
temperature of the left side were the same as that of the right side, or lower,
the question would still remain an open one ; for heat might be evolved in
the lungs, and yet the quantity might be insufficient to counterbalance the
loss of heat due to the evolution of large quantities of watery vapour, of car-

bonic acid, and to the heating of the air which we daily inspire.
   The first method, or that which consists in ascertaining the temperature

of the two sides of the heart, need scarcely be touched upon at present ; and
I shall merely confine myself to the statement that, in the hands of the most
experienced and reliable physiologists, and specially in those of Professor
Claude Bernard, it has led to the curious resxilt that the blood which
reaches the left ventricle is colder than that which leaves the right. This
result would, at first sight, appear to prove that if any heat be evolved in
the lungs, its amount is not sufficient to compensate the losses to which I
have already alluded, and rendered it absolutely essential that fresh experi-
ments should be conducted by a second method, which consists in ascer-
taining whether, when venous blood removed from the body is agitated with
oxygen or atmospheric aii', any changes occur in its temperature.

   The first step in the inquiry consisted in ascertaining the specific heat of
blood, for none of the experiments previously made had led to trustworthy
results. Dr. Crawford had, in the last century, advanced a theory of animal
heat which was based upon an assumed diff'erence in the specific heat of
arterial and venous blood : he supposed that the former possessed a very high,
and the latter a comparatively low specific heat ; so that in becoming arte-
rialized in the lungs, the heat resulting from the condensation, solution, and
probable chemical combination of oxygen with the blood became latent,
being, however, evolved as the blood circulated through the body, when,
becoming venous, it acquired a continually diminishing specific heat. Dr.
John Davy, in his ' Researches, Physiological and Anatomical,' vol. i. p. 141,
in a chapter entitled " On the Capacities of Venous and Arterial Blood for
Heat," described experiments which contradicted the hypothesis of Crawford
as to the difl^crence in the specific heat of the two varieties of blood, although
the extraordinary discrepancies between difi'erent experiments rendered it
impossible that any calculations could be based upon Dr. Davy's results. In
his experiments. Dr. DslXJ made use of defibrinated blood, employing for the
determination of specific heat the methods of mixture and rate of cooling.

   In the experiments which I performed last year, and wliich are published
in the last volume of the Eeports of the British Association, I made use
of the method of mixture, taking care to adopt aU the precautions which
modern experience has suggested. Making use of the perfectly fresh blood
of the ox, which was sometimes venous, sometimes arterial, I obtained re-
markably concordant results, the mean of which gave 1-02 as the coefficient
of the specific heat of blood. Having made this determination, I could pass

to the experiments intended to determine whether, in being arteriahzed,
blood which is perfectly venous becomes hotter.

   As a preface to my own researches on this subject, it is incumbent upon me

to allude to all the observations which have been made on this subject. In

the second volume of Dr. Davy's ' Eesearchcs, Physiological and Anatomical,'

--at p. 168 a section is devoted to the following question: " WJien oxygen is

absorbed by the blood, is there any production of heat ? "

   " To endeavour to determine this point," sa3^s Dr. Davy, " of so much in-

terest in connexion with the theory of animal heat, a very tliju vial, of the

capacity of eight liquid ounces, was selected and earefuUy enveloped in bad
conducting substances, viz. several folds of flannel, of fine oiled paper, and
of oiled cloth. Thus prepared, and a perforated cork being provided holding
a delicate thermometer, 2 cubic inches of mercury were introduced, and im-
mediately after it was fiUed with venous blood kept liquid as before described.

The vial was now corked and shaken ; the thermometer included was sta-

iiouary at 45°. After five minutes that it was so stationary the thermometer
was withdrawn ; the vial, closed by another cork, was transferred to a mercu-

rial bath, and Ig cubic inch of oxygen was introduced. The common cork
was retui-ned, and the vial was well agitated for about a minute : the ther-
mometer was now introduced ; it rose immediately to 4G°, and, continuing

the agitation, it rose further to 46°-5, very nearly to 47°. This experiment

was made on the 12th of February, 1838, on the blood of the sheep. On the
following day a similar experiment was made on the venous blood of man.

The -sial was filled with 11 cubic inches of this blood, its fibrine broken up in
the usual manner, and with 3 cubic inches of mercury; the temperature of
the blood and mercury was 42°-o, and the temperature was the same after
the introduction of 3 cubic inches of oxygen. The temperatui-e of the room
being 47°, a fire having shortly before been lit, the vial was taken to an ad-
joining passage, where the temperature of the air was 39°. Here the vial
was well agitated, held in the hand with thick gloves on as an additional
protection ; after about three quarters of a minute the thermometer in the
vial had risen a degree, viz. to 43°'5." Dr. Davy relates two other experi-
ments, of which the first Avas performed on the venous blood taken from the
jugular vein of a sheep, the second on arterial blood. The three experiments
with venous blood showed that when agitated with mercury and air for the
space of a minute, venous blood was heated to the extent of 1° Pahr., whilst
the arterial blood was heated only half a degree.

    Dr. Davy quotes Sir Charles Scudamore, who, in his ' Essay on the Blood,'
at p. 59, states that venous blood cools much more slowly in oxygen gas than
in atmospheric air ; that the same blood divided into two cupping-glasses,

" after an interval of eight minutes from the beginning of the experiment,"

--exhibited a diff'erence of 8°, that exposed to oxygen being 85°, that to atmo-

spheric air 77°.

    H. Nasse, in his article on Animal Heat in the fourth volume of Wagner's
* Handwiirterbuch der Physiologic' (1842), quotes Marchand to the effect
that when oxygen is shaken with blood the latter is heated.

    In a paper entitled " On the lielative Temperature of Arterial and Yenous

 Blood," Mr. "W. B. Savory, having described at considerable length observa-
 tions on the temperature of the two sides of the heart, describes others
 performed with a view to check the accuracy of the experiments of Dr.

--John Davy, and states the conclusions to which he was led by his own

 experiments, viz. 1st, that when venous blood is treated, as was done by
 Dr. Davy in his experiments, with oxygen, its temperature was usuaU}- raised
 from 1° to 1|° or 2°; 2ndly, that when venous blood was treated in a similar
 manner with hydrogen or carbonic acid, its temperature was as frequently

 raised, and generally to the same extent ; 3rdly, that similar experiments
 upon arterial blood usually jdelded the same results ; 4thly, that in all cases
 the increase of temperature seemed to be the result of the agitation. In
 concluding his paper, Mr. Savory remarked, " At present there is no evi-

 dence upon which we can safely venture further into this inquiry. If, as I

 conclude from my experiments, arterial blood is warmer than venous, the

 increase of temjierature must occur in the lungs as a resvilt of those changes
--140 REroRT 1871.

which tho hlood there undergoes. Of the nature of those changes, little or

nothing is known,"

   In my early researches, conducted during the months of May and June

1869, I had attempted to determine, by means of comparatively simple con-
trivances, whether any heat was evolved during arteriahzation, making use of
delicate thermometers. At first I used a glass bottle furnished with a tubu-
lature, near the bottom in which a cork, perforated and furnished with a glass^
tube closed by india-rubber tubing and a clip, was inserted. The neck of the
bottle was furnished with a cork perforated in two places ; through one of
the perforations a delicate Centigrade thermometer passed into the centre of
the flask, whilst into the other was inserted a bent glass tube through which
gas might be introduced into the apparatus. The bottle which I have de-
scribed was filled with venous blood, both the tubes communicating with its
interior being closed. It was then maintained at a temperature varying be-

tween 30° and 35° C. for many hours, until it had assumed the characteristic

cherry-red coloration which indicates the complete removal of the loosely
combined oxygen of the blood. The apparatus having been allowed to cool,

it was invested with a jacket of felt. An india-rubber tube was made to

connect the upper glass tube with a hydrogen gasometer, whilst the lower
tube being opened, the hydrogen expelled any required quantity of blood.
The apparatus was then shaken and the temperature determined. Then by
a repetition of the process (followed in the introduction of hydrogen) pure

oxygen gas was made to displace more of the blood, and the process of shaking
repeated as before. The results of such experiments were eminently unsatis-
factory, varying obviously with the amount of mechanical work which was
formed by the experiments, and which yet did not admit of exact deter-

mination.

    In some experiments I observed a heating which amounted to 0°-3 C. ; in

other cases the difference in the readings, before the introduction of oxj^geu

and after it, seemed to point to a cooling instead of to a heating. To
give an idea of the indefinite and perplexing results which I obtained, I
shall cite the details of an experiment performed on the 23rd of June, 1870,
by Professor Tait and myself, the apparatus used being a tin vessel resem-
bling in principle the one of glass which I have already described. This
vessel was covered with felt, and, when shaken, it was held by means of a
very strong iron clamp. Having been filled with sheep's blood, it was placed
in an air-oven and maintained for a period of twelve hours at a temperature
which oscillated between 100^ and 110° Pahr. It was afterwards placed in

the room in which my experiments were carried on ; but in order to make

it cool more rapidly, its felt covering was taken off, and it was placed in
water at a temperature of 15° C. It was dried, again covered with felt,
and fixed in its clamp. Hydrogen was then made to expel 4-5 cubic
inches of blood, which was found by spectroscopic examination to exhibit the
single band of reduced haemoglobin ; after shaking the blood and hydrogen
in the apparatus, its temperature was found to be 17°'S 0., then 18° C, the
temperature of the air being 20°-4 C. 10 cubic inches of blood were then
drawn off and replaced by oxygen, which was brought in contact with the
blood by shaking ; the temperature rose to 18°-1 C. : more oxygen was intro-
duced and the shakinc; repeated, the temperature rising to 18°-25, 18°-4, 18°-5,
18°-6, 18°-6, 18°-55,l8°-7, 18°- 75, 18°-77. At the conclusion of the experi-
ment the quantity of blood which had been arterialized was found to be 3G0
cubic centims. This experiment merely gave one of many results ; for as long
as I followed this method I was quite unable twice to determine the same

amount of heat as the result of oxygenation of the blood. The amount of

heating in a given time depended upon several important factors, as the dif-

ference bet-sveen the temperature of the blood in the experimental vessel and

that of the surrounding air, upon the amount of blood contained in the appa-

ratus, and the space through which the vessel was moved during its agitation,

no less than upon the number of the agitations.

To describe, or even to give the results of a series of experiments so emi-

nently unsatisfactory, woiild be a mere waste of time ; it will be sufficient

for me to state, however, that I clearly came to the conclusion that, like those

who had preceded me, I had obtained no positive proof of the heating of

blood when it absorbs oxygen, there having been as great a heating when

water as when blood was experimented upon.

In commencing new experiments this year, I did so with the conviction

mythat, in order to obtain results of any value,  apparatus shoiild be so con-

structed and my experiments so conducted as to preclude the possibility of

any appreciable rise in temperature resulting from the mechanical work of

shaking. Then I decided upon discarding thermometers, and making use of

thermo-electric junctions of great delicacy.

The galvanometer employed in the research was one resembling one of

Wm.Sir Thomson's older forms, constructed especially for Professor Tait,

every possible precaution having been taken to avoid a trace of iron in

the coils and framework. The wire was drawn through agate plates

from electrolytic copper, covered with white silk and formed into four coils,

each adjusted to produce the maximum effect with the least resistance,

those parts of the coils nearest the magnets being made of finer wire.

The astatic system vibrated under the earth's force once in eight seconds

but as this was much too delicate for my purpose, I placed near the in-

Btriiment a bar-magnet, which reduced the period of vibration to 3^-4.
   The thermo-electric junctions which I employed were made by twisting

very thin iron and copper wire together, the free ends of the copper wires

being immersed into the mercury pools of a very simple form of commu-

tator placed in the circuit, which enabled me, with the greatest ease, to

reverse the current flowing along the wires.

   The apparatus actually employed in my experiments consisted of an

upper glass vessel, which I may call the blood reservoir, to which was con-

nected a lower vessel, also of glass, and in which the blood, wliich was the

subject of experiment, could be brought in contact Avith the gases which

were intended to act upon it.

The iipper vessel was a glass bulb of a pyriform shape, and had a capacity

of about 150 cubic centimetres. Above and below it was drawn out, so as to

present two tubes, the upper of which was bent at right angles and furnished

with a piece of india-rubber tubing, which admitted of being closed by a clamp,

whilst the lower was furnished with a very accurately ground stopcock. In

the side of the bulb was a round tubulature, which could be closed with a cork,

through which passed a thermo-electric junction. The lower, or mixing-

vessel, was cylindrical in shape, and possessed four apertures. The upper one

was closed by a cork, bored so as to allow of the passage of a glass tube,

attached above by means of an elastic tube to the stopcock of upper vessel or

reservoir, and made of such a length as to reach to the bottom of the mixing-

vessel. N^ear the upper aperture was a second lateral one, into which a

glass tube had been fused. This glass tube could be connected, by means of

a metallic tube and stopcocks, eitlier with a Sprengel mercurial aspirator or

Awith an oxygen or hydrogen gasometer.            third lateral aperture waa

closed with a cork, perforated (like the one which closed the upper vessel)

Aby a second thermal junction.  fourth aperture in the mixing-vessel,

closed by a stopcock, enabled it to be emptied.

   In determining with such an apparatus whether heat is generated when

venous blood becomes arterial, the upper vessel is disconnected from the

lower at a point below the glass stopcock previously described ; it is com-

pletely filled with water, and then the water is displaced by a stream of

pure hydrogen gas admitted through the upper tube.

The lower glass tube is then connected with the vessel which contains the

blood to be experimented upon. The upper tube, through which hydrogen had

been admitted, is now connected to the Sprengel pump, which rapidly sucks

the blood into the vessel, Avithout the slightest j)ossibility of its coming in

contact with oxygen. The upper vessel is either partially or completely filled

with blood, but it always is ultimately left in connexion with a hydrogen

gasometer.

The mixing-vessel (the lowest aperture of which has been closed by india-

rubber tubing and clip) is now connected to the Sprengel pump, and a va-

cuum is formed into which hydrogen is allowed freely to flow. The vacuum

is renewed three or four times consecutively, hydrogen being allowed to flow

into the apparatus each time. The object of this is to exclude traces from

the lower vessel of atmospheric oxygen.

The stopcock which connects the upper and lower vessels is opened, and

venous blood is allowed to flow into the lower vessel. In actual work both

the upper and lower vessels are thickly covered with wadding. The upper

one is firmly fixed in a clamp, and constitutes a reservoir, which, except

when the atmospheric changes in temperature are abnormally sudden, main-

tains during limited periods of time a constant temperature. The lower .tube

being connected to the stopcock of the upper by means of a flexible india-

rubber tube, admits of being comj^letcly tilted, or, if necessary, shaken.

As soon as the lower vessel contains the blood to be experimented upon,

the thermal junctions are bi'ought in connexion with the galvanometer.

The amount of deviation on the graduated scale, and the direction of the

deviation, at once tells the experimenter whether the upper or the lower

junction be the hotter. The lower vessel is thoroughly shaken, then, after

some time, the temperature of its contents is determined by reading on the

scale placed in front of the galvanometer. The tube and its contents are

then repeatedly tilted, a reading of the galvanometer being taken after each

set of five tilts. After a certain time the lower vessel has assumed a constant

temperature, and readings, at the interval of two or three minutes, show no

perceptible change. I may remark that the galvanometer which, through
the kindness of Prof. Tait, was placed at my disposal was so set tbat in my

various experiments one division of the divided scale corresponded to the

100th or the 120th of a degree Cent. The first observations made with my

apparatus were intended to determine whether such an amount of agitation

as would be required to communicate a thoroughly arterial colour to perfectly

venous blood would heat the fluid to a perceptible extent, in consequence of

the mechanical work expended in the agitation.

In preliminary experiments I foimd that venous blood assumed a beauti-

ful arterial hue, when it was mixed with oxygen contained in the mixing-

vessel, by successively tilting the tube twenty times. In each tilt the tube

containing blood and oxygen was completely reversed. In other preli-

minary experiments I found that when the tulje contained thoroughly arte-

riaUzed blood or water, the process of tilting had no influence on the
             ON HEAT GENERATED IN THE BLOOD.                  143

temperature of the contained fluid. It was, therefore, obvious that any heat-

ing which might occur in the process of tilting or shaking in subsequent
experiments could not be referred to the mechanical work expended in the

tube and its contents.

  My next experiments consisted in determining whether, when agitated

with a neutral gas, as, for example, hydrogen, any material change in the

temperature of the blood occurred ; they led to the result that when agi-

tated with hydrogen gas no heating of the blood results, it being always
remembered that the mechanical agitation to which the blood and the

neutral gas were subjected was the same as in my experiments with blood

and oxygen.

   In ray systematic experiments on the heat generated during the process
of arterialization, the following observations were always made :

   1. The temperature of the lower as contrasted with the upper vessel was
determined after the latter had been exhausted.

2. The temperature- observations were repeated after shaking with hy-

drogen.

3. After the renewal of a vacuum.

4. After admission of oxygen in the mixing-vessel.

   5. After oxygen had been thoroughly shaken with the blood.

  The results of my experiments on veiy numerous samples of venous blood

have led to the conclusion that whilst, as I have previously mentioned, no

heat is evolved on agitating blood with hydrogen, there is, on agitation with

oxygen, always a slight evolution of heat.

   To determine the exact heating, when venous blood of varying gaseous

Wecomposition is arterialized, appears to be most desirable.  should espe-

cially attempt to determine the heating observed when the average venous

blood contained in the right ventricle and directly drawn from it is ar-

terialized. The first and most important datum to be ascertained appeared
to me, however, to be the heating which takes place when blood which has
been thoroughly reduced, i. e. which contains no loosely combined oxygen

and exhibits Stokes's spectrum, is completely arterialized.

   From five sets of experiments on the heat developed during the arteriali-
zation of perfectly reduced blood, I arrived at the conclusion that the mean

rise of temperatiire during the absorption of oxygen amounted to 0°-0976 C.

The maximum heating found was 0°'lll C, and the minimum 0°-083C.

The research, of which the above are the results, was conducted in the

Physical Laboratory of the University of Edinburgh ; and I have to express

my thanks to Professor Tait for the uniform kindness with which he helped

me by advice, assistance, and apparatus in ascertaining the facts which are

recorded in this Report. I intend to extend these researches very greatly.

It is most desirable that in future experiments venous blood of known com-
position be employed, and that the amount of oxygen absorbed and CO^

evolved be ascertained after each experiment. I propose likewise to increase

the period during which the blood is agitated, making use of an arrangement

whereby the mechanical work performed in the agitation may be precisely

determined.

REPORT 1871.

        Report of the Committee appointed to consider the subject of
                                 Physiological Experimentation.

A CouoiiTTEE, consisting of ten individuals, having been appointed at the last

Meeting of the British Association, held at Liverpool, to consider the subject
of Physiological Experimentation, in accordance -with a Resolution of the
General Committee hereto annexed, the following Report was drawn up and
signed by seven members of the Committee.

                              Report.

i. No experiment which can be performed under the influence of an anaes-

        thetic ought to be done without it.

ii. No painful experiment is justifiable for the mere purpose of illustrating a

       law or fact already demonstrated ; in other words, experimentation with-
       out the employment of ansesthetics is not a fitting exhibition for teaching

         purposes.

iii. Wliencvcr, for the investigation of new truth, it is necessary to make a
       painful experiment, every effort should l)e made to ensure success, in
      order that the suffering inflicted may not be wasted. For this reason,
       no painful experiment ought to be performed by an unskilled person

       with insufficient instruments and assistance, or in places not suitable to
       the purpose, that is to say, anywhere except in physiological and patho-

       logical laboratories, under proper regulations.

iv. In the scientific preparation for veterinary practice, operations ought not
       to be performed upon living animals for the mere purpose of obtaining

greater operative dexterity.

PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION OF ORGANIC CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS. 145

 Report on the Physiological Action of Organic Chemical Compounds.

        By Benjamin Ward Richardson, M.A., M.D., F.R.S.

The plan I have heretofore followed, of passing under review the practical

results of the labours chronicled in previous Reports, cannot be carried out

this year. The review itself would now become so comprehensive that it

would occupy all the time allowed for the reading of the Report to the ex-

clusion of the new matter to be brought forward. I shall therefore proceed
at once to the description of new research.

                    Chloeal Hydrate.

It is two years since the substance called chloral hydrate (the physio-

logical properties of which had been previously discovered by Liebreich) was

introduced into this country at the jN'orwich Meeting of this Association.

During the first year of tlie employment of chloral hydrate the enthusiasm

connected with the learning of its value prevented, in some degree, all fair

criticism as to its real values and dangers. The year immediately past

has afforded time for calmer and more judicial observation, greatty, as I think,

to the advantage of the public, since it has given to the professors of medical

art the opportunity of learning that the new agent placed in their hands,

blessing as it is to humanity, is not an unalloyed blessing, but one that haS

engendered a new and injurious habit of narcotic luxury, and has added

another cause to the preventible causes of the mortality of the nation.

Recognizing these truths, I have felt it a duty to devote some part of the

labours of this Report to the elucidation of questions which have become of

public, not less than of scientific importance, and to these I would now ask

attention.

1. I have endeavoured to ascertain what is a dangerous and what a fatal

dose of chloral hydrate. The conclusion at which I have been able first to

anive on this point is, that the maximum quantity of the hydrate that can

be borne, at one dose, bears some proportion to the weight of the animal

subjected to its influence. The rule, however, does not extend equally to

animals of any and every class. The proportion is practically the same in

Athe sam'e classes, but there is no actual universality of rule.  mouse weigh-

ing from three-quarters of an ounce to an ounce .will be put to sleep by one

Aquarter of a grain of the hydrate, and will be killed by a grain.       pigeon

weighing twelve ounces will be put to sleep by two grains of the hydrate, and

Awill be killed by five grains.  guineapig weighing sixteen ounces will be

Aput by two grains into deep sleep, and by five grains into fatal sleep.

rabbit weighing eighty-eight ounces will be thrown by thirty grains into

deep sleep, and by sixty grains into fatal sleep.

   The human subject, weighing from one hundred and twenty to one hundred
and forty pounds, will be made by ninety grains to pass-into deep sleep, and

by one hundred and forty grains into a sleep that will be dangerous.

   Prom the eflfects produced on a man who had of his own accord taken a

hundred and twenty grains of the hydrate, and who seemed at one period to

be passing into death, I was led to infer that in the human subject one

hundred and forty grains should be accepted as dangerous, and one hundred

and eighty as a fatal dose. Evidence has, however, recently been brought

before me which leads me to think that, although eighty grains would

in most instances prove fatal, it could, under very favourable circumstances,

be recovered from.

1871.                                                             1
--146 REPORT 1871.

   Dr. Hills, of the Thorpe Asylum, Norwich, has, for example, favoured me
with the facts of an instance in which a suicidal woman took no less than

four hundred ami seventy-hvo grains of the hydrate dissolved in sixteen ounces
of water, and actually did not die for thirty-three hours. Such a fact, ably
observed as it was, is startling ; but it does not, I think, militate against the

rule that one hundred and forty grains is the maximum quantity that
should, under any circumstances, be administered to the human subject.

   A2. second point to which my attention has been directed is, what quan-

tity of hydrate of chloral can be taken with safety at given intervals for a

given period of time, say of twenty-four hours. To arrive at some fair con-
clusion on this subject, I calculated from a series of experiments the
time required for the development of symptoms from different doses of the
hydrate, the full period of the symptoms, and the time when they had entii-ely
passed away. Great difficulties attend this line of investigation ; but I may
state, as a near approximation to the truth, that an adult person who has
taken chloral in sufficient quantity to be influenced by it, disposes of it at the
rate of about seven grains per hour. In repeated doses, the hydrate of chloral
might therefore be given at the rate of twelve grains every two hours for
twenty-four hours, with less danger than would occur from giving twelve
times twelve (14-i) grains at once ; but I do not think that amount ought,

except in the extremest emergencies, to be exceeded even in divided

 quantities.

   A3. third point to which I have paid attention is, the means to be adopted

in any case when, from accident or other cause, a large and fatal dose of
 chloral hydrate has been administered. I can speak here with precision. It

should be remembered that this hydrate, from its great solubility, is rapidly
 diffused through all the organism. It is in vain, consequently, to attempt its
removal by any extreme measures after it has fairly taken effect. In other
 words, the animal or person under chloral, like an animal or person in a

fever, must go through a distinct series of stages on the way to recovery or

 death ; and these stages will be long or short, slightly dangerous or intensely
 dangerous, all but fatal or actually fatal, according to the conditions by which
the animal is suiTounded, One of the first and marked effects of the chloral is

reduction of the animal temperature ; and when an animal is deeply under the

 influence of the agent, in the fourth degree of narcotism of Dr. Snow, the tem-
perature of its body, unless the external warmth be carefully sustained, will

 quickly descend seven and even eight degrees below the natural standard.

 Such reduction of temperature is itself a source of danger ; it allows conden-

 sation of fluid on the bronchial pulmonary surface, and so induces apncea,

 and it indicates a period when the convulsion of cold (a convulsion which

 sharply precedes death) is at hand.

     I offer these explanations in order to indicate the first favourable condition

 for the recovery of an animal or man from the effects of an extreme dose of

 chloral hydi'ate. It is essential that the body of the animal be kept warm,

 and not merely so, but that the air inspired by the animal be of high tempe-
 rature. The first effort to recovery, in short, should consist in placing the

 animal in a warm air. This fact is perfectly illustrated by experiment on

 the inferior animals. In the pigeon an air of 95° Fahr. is most favourable,

 in the rabbit an air at 105° to 110°, in the dog the same. In man the

 air to be breathed should be raised and sustained at 90° Fahr. at least*.

     * I have no doubt it -n-ill be found, as tbo chronicle of deaths from chloral hydrate in-
 creases, that the mortality from the agent wUl be greatest when the thermometrical
  readings are the lowest, and vice versa.
PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION OF ORGANIC CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS. 147

The nest thing to be remembered in the recovery of persons under the

fatal influence of chloral hydrate is to sustain the body by food. I find that

under even deep sleep from the narcotic, although the process of waste is less

than is common under natural conditions of rest, there is still a very con-

siderable waste in progress, which, if not made up, is against recovery. I

find also that the digestive and assimilating powers, thoiigh impaired diuing

sleep from chloral, are not arrested, but may be called into fair action with so
much advantage, that if two animals be cast into deep sleep by an excessive

quantity of the narcotic, and one be left without food and the other be artifi-

cially fed on warm food, one fourth of the chance of recovery is given to the
animal that is supplied with food. In the human subject wai-m milk, to

which a little lime-water has been added, is the best food. Milk is very easily

administered mechanically, and it should be administered in the proportion

of half a pint every two hours*.

   4. The fourth point to remember is to sustain the breathing ; in the
inferior animals the question of life or death can be made to turn on this

pivot. But the artificial respiration must be carried out with great gentle-

ness ; it must not be done by vehement movements of the body or compres-
sions of the chest, but by the simple process of inflating the luugs by means

of small bellows, through the nostrils. I have devised, in the course of the

researches conducted chiefly for the Association, various instruments for
artificial respiration, viz. a small double-acting bellows, a small syringe, and

a double-acting india-rubber pocket-bellows ; but I have lately made an ob-
servation which leads to a simpler method still, i. e. I merely attach to a

single hand-bellows a nostril-tube, and gently inflate the lungs, letting the

Aelasticity of the chest-wall do the work of expiration.  little valve near

to the nostril-tube effectually stops aR back currents from the lungs into

the bellows. For the human subject, five charges of air from the bellows

should be given at intervals of five seconds apartt.
    There is another subject of public interest connected with the employ-

ment of chloral hydrate. I refer to the increasing habitual use of it as a

narcotic. As there are alcoholic intemperants and opium-eaters, so now

there are those who, beginning to take chloral hydrate to relieve pain or to
procure sleep, get into the fixed habit of taking it several times daily and in

full doses. I would state from this public place, as earnestly and as forcibly

as I can, that this growing practice is alike injurious to the mental, the

moral, and the purely physical organization, and that the confirmed habit
of taking chloral hydrate leads inevitably to confirmed disease. The diges-

tion gets impaired ; natural tendency to sleep and natural sleep are impaired
the blood is changed in quality, its plastic properties and its capacity for

oxidation being reduced; the secretions are depraved; and, the nervous system

losing its regulating, controlling power, the muscles become unsteady, the
heart irregular and intermittent, and the mind uncertain and irritable. To

crown the mischief, in not a few cases already the habitual dose has been the

last, involuntary or rather unintentional suicide closing the scene.

   I press these facts on public notice not a moment too soon, and I add to

them the facts, that hydrate of chloral is purely and absolutely a medicine,
and that whenever its administration is not guided by medical science and

experience, it ceases to be a boon, and becomes a curse to mankind.

   * This question of feeding is applicable to all foi-ras of accidental narcotic poisoning.
In every such case the poisoning is a distinct process, and the recovery turns largely on the

sustainnient of tlie animal force by supply of food and of external -warmth.

   t Dr. Richardson exhibited the different instruments described.
                                                                                                                  1.2
148 REPORT ISri.

             Anhtdrotts Chloral.

The hydrate of chloral, of which I have treated above, is made from

another substance, called anhydrous chloral, by the addition to the latter of a
certain proportion of simple water. Anhydrous chloral was discovered

by Liebig in 1832, and is formed by the process of passing chlorine through

absoMe alcohol. It is a colourless oily fluid, of specific gravity 1502, at

64° Pahr. It boils at 93° Cent. (199° Fahr.); its composition is C.HClj 0, and

its vapour-density, taking hydrogen as unity, is 73. It dissolves in ether,

alcohol, and hydride of amyl.

The vapour of anhydrous chloral is irritating and painful to an extreme

degree when it is inhaled, and the substance has consequently not attracted

attention as a subject for physiological study. Having, however, a pure

specimen of it prepared by Dr. Versmann, I thought it was worth while to

make a research with it. The results have proved worthy of the trouble ; in

fact I have rarely derived from so simple an investigation so rich a practical

result. It would be inferred a priori that anhydrous chloral in the liquid

state would be, like its vapour, a powerful irritant to the skin and mucous

membrane. I soon found, however, that this was not the fact, that I could

apply the  myfluid freely to  ovm. skin and to  the tongue without injury,  and

that the caustic action is extremely mild, even when the substance is applied

to a moist surface. If a quarter grain of it (anhydrous chloral) be placed

upon the skin of the frog in a dry atmosphere, there is a rather quick ab-

sorption, followed by the formation of a white film of the hydrate of chloral
beneath the skin, which film soon disappears by absorption, the symptoms
following the absorption being the specific narcotic symptoms of chloral
hydrate. The animal soon falls into a deep sleep with complete muscular

exhaustion.

If in higher animals, birds and rabbits, anhydrous chloral be injected sub-

cutaneously, the same phenomena are indicated, the quantities for producing

the specific effects being the same as are required for the hydrate.
   It is clear from these observations that anhydrous chloral, when brought

into contact with the exposed surfaces of the^body, abstracts water from the

part with which it is in contact, becomes converted into the hydrate, and is
directly absorbed into the body, producing tlie same symptoms as the pre-

pared hydrate produces when it is introduced into the organism.
   As anhydrous chloral is soluble in amyl hydride, ether, and many other

volatile fluids, I tried whether any of it coiild be carried over with the vapour

of amyl hydride, and whether, if it were administered in this way, it would

produce prolonged narcotism by being transformed into the hydrate in the

lungs and taken up into the blood.

The result of the experiment was to show that in frogs, guineapigs, and

pigeons general narcotism can be so induced, and that the narcotism is pro-

longed far beyond what follows from the simple inhalation of amyl hydride.

But I observed that when the solution used contained so little as twenty

minims of anhydrous chloral to an ounce of the hydride, the vapour given ofl:"

was irritating to breathe ; and when I breathed it myself I found it caused dry-

Aness of the throat and a sense of constriction, which lasted several minutes.

weaker solution than that named is too slow in its action, and I therefore can
hardly at this moment recommend that anhydrous chloral should be ad-

ministered by inhalation. It is possible, nevertheless, that in course of time

the agent may be found serviceable when administered in the manner de-
scribed. It is probable that much smaller quantities, administered for a much
         PHVSIOLOGICAL ACTIOiil OF OKGANIC CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS. 149

longer time, would be serviceable in sustaining a slight narcotism. It is pro-
bable that in some chronic diseases of the throat or bronchial passages, where
the effect of a local narcotic would be desirable, this mode of practice may-

find favour from its success. Again, it may be that in disease of the lungs
themselves, where there is loss of structure (cavity), anhydrous chloral may be
inhaled in minute quantities with advantage. I name these points in order
to caU the attention of fellow physicians to the mode of administration I

have ventured to suggest.
    Connected also with anhydrous chloral is another reasonable suggestion

I mean the plan of applying the agent as a narcotic caustic to unnatural
growths and ulcerating fungoid surfaces. I find that by applying the fluid

myto arm freely there is destruction of the epidermis (scarf skin), so that

without any pain the epidermis peels off, almost dry, at the point where the
fluid has been placed ; and that when on this exposed surface some of the
fluid is applied, the true skin is in turn affected, so that in a day or two

what the ancients called an issue may be developed, the tissiies destroyed
coming away in the form of scales. The surgeon wiU at once see the prac-
tical utility of an agent possessing these properties, and he may in. some

instances subcutaneously inject the fluid if the outward employment of it be

too slow.

   It is a very curious experiment to subject freshly drawn blood to anhj'-
drous chloral, and to observe microscopically the changes that ensue. The
action of the chloral is to extract water both from the liquor sanguinis and
the corpuscles, and to form crystalline chloral hydrate. Into this formation
the shrinking corpuscles sink, rt'hile the fibrine remains free from precipi-
tation ; but if water be added, so as to dissolve and remove the hydrate that
has been formed, the corpuscles are to some extent restored, and the fibrino
coagulates and separates in the usual way.

                                                Metachiokal.

    Under favouring conditions anhydrous chloral is converted into an in-
soluble substance, to which the name of " metachloral " has been applied.
The change sometimes occurs spontaneously, as it has done in a specimen
now on the table ; but it is always effected when chloral is brought into

contact with sulphuric acid. Dr. Versmann has made for me some beautiful

specimens of metachloral by this last-named process.
    Metachloral is a white substance, easily reducible into a fine powder, but

insoluble in water and in alcohol. It is isomeric with chloral itself, being

merely different in respect to physical condition. When it is treated with

an alkali it yields, as chloral does, an alkaline formate and chloroform.

These facts led me to ask whether, in the animal body, metachloral would

undergo decomposition and produce specific narcotic effects : and here, again,
a series of results were obtained of great interest. Administered to birds in
the form of pilule, and to other animals either in the same form or in sus-
pension in glim emulsion, the metachloral, so insoluble in water, is found to
undergo solution in the animal secretions, and to produce the same narcotic
effects as the chloral hydrate, viz. narcotism, muscular prostration, and de-
crease of animal temperature.

    In the pigeon from ten to fifteen grains are sufficient to' take fuU effect.
The animal in the course of an hour becomes drowsy, and in an hour and a

half is in a perfect sleep, from which, nevertheless, it may be roused, to fall

back again into sleep with great rapidity : the sleep lasts from three to four
150 REPORT 1871.

hours. The temperature of the body undergoes considerable change, falling,
in the pigeon, full five degrees Fahi-euheit, and remaining so reduced that a
period of eight and even nine hours is required for its complete restoration
to the natural standard. On frogs the effect of metachloral is equally marked.

A frog -weighing ten drachms is fairly narcotized in thirty minutes by a dose

of a quarter of a grain, the insensibility continuing manj' hours and closely
simulating death. During the period of deep insensibility the muscles re-
main in the most extreme state of flaccidity, but do not fail to respond to
the galvanic stimulus.

   To rabbits comparatively larger doses of metachloral may be administered

by the mouth -n-ithoat exciting any eflect whatever. To a large rabbit weighing
eight pounds, ten grains may be given with absolute freedom from symptoms
of narcotism ; but when the dose is increased to twenty grains a very distinct
effect is produced. About one hour following upon the administration the
animal sinks into sleep precisely as if he had taken chloral hydi-atc, and
passes through all the stages of narcotism and recovery in the same way.

    The action of metachloral is fidl of interest in a physiological point of
view, and goes far, I think, to sustain Liebreich's original view of the action
of chloral hydrate, \'iz. that the narcotism produced by it is due to the action of

chloroform liberated within the body. On this view metachloral is first

 changed in the body, under the influence of alkali, into the soluble condi-
 tion, after which it passes into the hydrate, and then into alkaline formate
 and chloroform. It is thus slower tliau the hydrate and slower than the
 anhydrous chloral in its action, but in the end the effects from it are the same.

 Metachloral admits of being employed mcdicinaUy ; it may be combined

 with morphia, quinine, and other alkaloids, and wUl, I think, be foimd to

 possess many useful medicinal qualities.

                                        Beomal Hydeate.

     "WTien bromine is made to act upon chlorine, a substance called brom-al is
 the product. It is an oily substance like chloral, and when acted upon by
 alkalies is decomposed into formiate of the alkali employed, and into bromo-
 form, the analogue in the bromine of chloroform in the chlorine series. The

 composition of bromal is C, HBrjO. When it is treated with water a crys-

 talline substance, bromal hydrate, is produced. The composition of bromal

 Hhydrate is C^ lii\ 2H, ; it is the analogue in the bromine of the chloral

 hydrate in the chlorine series. Eromal hydrate has an odour somewhat like

 chloral liydi'ate ; its crystals are verj- soluble in water, and it may be ad-
  ministered in solution by the mouth or by hypodermic injection.

     Verj' soon after the discovery of the action of chloral hydi-ate I commenced

 a research on the physiological properties of the bromal hydrate. Two other
  observers also moved in the same path, and have preceded me in recording

  what they had observed. One of these is Dr. Steinann, of Berlin, the other
  Dr. John DougaU, of Glasgow. In theu" researches nearly the same class of

 inquiries were instituted as in my own, the same animals were subjected to

  observation, and practically the same results were obtained.

     In order to i:)roduce marked cflects from bromal hydrate, much smaller
  doses are required than of the corresponding chloral compound ; five grains

  of the former are equivalent to ten of the latter. After an ctncient dose the

 symptoms produced resemble in many respects the symptoms that foUow

  chloral; i. e. there is great muscular prostration and a kind of narcotism, at-
  tended, however, with very slight insensibility, except in cases in which the
  dose has been dangerously large. In extreme cases only is there really deep
         PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION OF OKGANIC CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS, 151

anffisthesia ; in all cases there is sudden and extreme decrease of the animal

temperature. In birds, rabbits, guineapigs, as well as in the human subject,
tlieso phenomena are observable. But there are other symptoms belonging

to bromal hydrate which are peculiar to it, and Avhich render its practical
ntihty, according to our present knowledge of it at any rate, doubtful. It is
intensely irritating ; it causes great difficulty of respiration ; it so suddenly
and effectually reduces the animal temperature that the accumulation of fluid
in the bronchial canals, from condensation, is a source of positive danger,
and altogether its internal employment would be unwise. I agree with
Drs. Steinann and DougaU as to the mode of its action, and, with them,
attribute the phenomena to the effects of the bromoform that is liberated in
the body after the dose has been administered ; I agree also with Dougall
that the cause of death, when the dose is fatal and slow, is due to asphyxia.
I attribute the asphyxia primarily to the fall of temperature of the body, and
secondarily to condensation of water in the bronchial passages.

   One condition I have noticed which seems not to have fallen under the
attention of the learned observers I have named, viz. that in bii'ds a large

dose of the bromal hydrate may destroy life almost instantaneously by

an intense convulsion, amounting, in fact, to suddenly developed tetanus.

   The chief interest at this moment attaching to bromal hydrate is the dif-

ference that is seen in its action, in comparison with the action of chloral

hydrate. It illustrates how a difference of chemical elementary constitution
and of weight modifies physiological action ; how the heavier bromine in

combination with carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and water differs in action
from chlorine in similar combination. The science of therapeutics will ulti-
mately rest on these distinctions.

                                            NlTEITE OF AmTL.

   At the Meeting of the Association held at Newcastle-on-Tyne in 1863, I
introduced this curious and potent substance to the notice of the Association,
and explained, as best I could, its history and its physiological properties.
Every year since then some new fact of interest has attached to the sub-
stance, and the immediate past year is not different in this respect from
those that have preceded it. The first observer of the action of nitrite of
amyl on the animal functions was Professor Guthrie, P.E.S., then of Edin-
burgh, and now of the School of Mines, London. Professor Guthrie observed,
while working in the laboratory with nitrite of amyl, that the inhalation of

its vapour produced flttshing of the face, rapid action of the heart, a peculiar
breathlessness, such as occurs after fast running, and disturbance of cerebral

action. These facts, most ably described by the^ Pi'ofessor, became known
to Mr. Morison, a dentist in Edinbttrgh, who thought from them that the
substance might be made of service for the treatment of persons who were
suffering from faintness. He therefore brought some of the compound to

the College of Dentists, a Society then existing in London, and the Council
of that institution referred the whole subject to mo, with a request that I
would report to them. The task was readily undertaken, and the study con-
nected with it has not been completed at this hour.

    I take the liberty of mentioning these details for the sake of historical

accuracy. From the circumstance that I have introduced nitrite of amyl

greatly into medical practice, and have been year after year treating of its
action, it has been all but universally believed that I made the earliest
observations upon it; I would correct this error : I have worked industriously
with nitrite of amyl, have studied careftilly its mode of action, and have sug-
--J 53 KEPOKT 1871.

gested many new applications of it ; but the credit of tlie earliest observa-

tions, as I stated at Newcastle, belongs strictly to Professor Guthrie.

   It will be remembered by some that in one of my early papers on nitrite

of amyl I pointed out that the effects observed were clearly due to an in-
duced paralysis of the vascular system, of the terminal part of that system,
and that the heart passed into vehement motion, not, as I at first had thought,
because it was excited by the agent, but because the resistance to its action
being removed, it ran down like a clock in which the resistance to the
spring is broken by the removing of the pendulum or the pallets. I
further explained that the seeming over-action produced by the nitrite was
in truth no evidence of power or tension of muscle, but that in truth, under
the influence of the nitrite, the muscular system is brought into extreme
relaxation, so that the substance might be used as a remedy for the relief
even of tetanic spasm. These views have been sustained by later observa-

tion. It remained, however, still to discover how far the relaxation of ves-

sels from nitrite of amyl extended to the fimctious of special oi-gans of the
body ; and during the present year I have followed up this line of research
in respect to the changes producible by it in the pulmonary organs, the lungs.
The study has been most fruitful, and will, I think, as it is foUowed up, open

qtiite a new field of accurate and sound observation as to the mode in which
many diseases of the lungs take their origin.

   As there may be many here who are not conversant with the nature and
properties of nitrite of amyl, I may say briefl}^ in respect to it, that it is an

amber- coloured fluid, having the odour of ripe pears, and, although requiring
a high temperature for ebullition, volatilizing very readily on exposure to

the air.

   When taken into the body nitrite of amyl produces intense flushing of the

face, throbbing and sensation of fulness in the head, rapid action of the heart,

and in time a sense of breathless exhaustion. In my previous Reports I

have entered at length into details of its action, of which the following is a

summary.
    The nitrite, though insoluble in water, will enter the body and produce

its specific action by any channel of the body, by the cellular tissue, stomach,

blood. It produces general muscular paralysis, aff'ecting directly or indirectly

all the motor centres.
    It exerts no primary action on the sensory centres, and therefore does not

produce anassthesia.
     Its paralyzing action seems first to be directed to the organic nervous

centres, by which the vascular tension is reduced. It acts, in fact, after tho
manner of an emotional sjiock, leading quickly to paralysis of the minute

 vessels.

    It prevents oxidation by its presence, and possesses distinct antiseptic
powers. It produces a peculiar tarry condition of the blood, but docs not

materially impede coagulation.

    It neutralizes the tetanic action of strychnia, and removes tetanic spasm.

   On reviewing these inferences of former years, as thus detailed, I see no

occasion to change one of them ; indeed I believe they have, on the whole,
all been confirmed by other observers. The admirable experiments of Dr.
Brunton on the action of the nitrite on vascular tension call for special re-

cognition. There is, however, one observation in my Ileport of 1864 I would

like to correct. f?pcaking at that time of the action of the nitrite on the
 muscles, I remarked that it first excites the muscular system, and then para-

 lyzes it. I am in doubt now whether the muscular excitement of which I
         PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION OF ORGANIC CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS. 153

spoke in 1864 is a true excitement due to the influence excited by the agent

on the motor centres. I think, from my own sensations, it is rather due to an

indirect or mental impression, that it indicates a vehement desire to escape
from the influence of the agent, like the excitement of fear or frenzy.

   Let me from these points turn to the observations of the past year. I

observed long ago, in making dissections of the bodies of animals that had
died from amyl nitrite, that the condition of the lungs varied much, that
sometimes the lungs were of milky whiteness, sometimes of leaden hue,

and again of deep dark red hue. It occurred to me at last that these differ-

ences were not accidental, but that they depended upon the mode in which
the agent destroyed the life of the animal. Thereupon 1 made direct inquiry
into this subject, and was led to discover that I could, practically, modify the
circulation of the blood, passing over the lung from the right to the left

heart, as I pleased ; in other words, I learned that the vessels of the luugs

are influenced by the nitrite in the same manner as the vessels of the skin.

   The observation thus stated led me naturally a step further. I inquired

as to results of different temporary lesions that might be inflicted on the
pulmonary organs by the nitrite, and what extremity of lesion could be
recovered from under conditions favourable to recover3\ I commenced this
research in February last, and have carried it on without intermission from
that time : the results of the labour have been most instructive.

   There are four distinct conditions of lung producible by nitrite of amyl

there may be more, but I know of these :

   1. If the animal be destroyed by an overwhelming dose of the agent, so
that it dies instantly, as it might die from sjoicope, the lungs are left
absolutely bloodless and of pure whiteness. The right side of the
heart is in this case paralyzed ; but exposed to the air immediately after
death it often recovers its power of contraction. In this instance the
death is reallj^ by syncope ; the nervous paralysis is extended immediately to
the heart, probably from paralysis of the sympathetic supply, and the right
ventricle failing to pour out its blood to the lung, the death is so instan-
taneous that there is no time left for the production of any organic change.

    2. If the death be comparatively slow, if it be preceded by a short interval
of muscular prostration, and if it occur from paralysis of the muscles
of respiration, then the lungs are left charged with dark tarry blood,
but they contain air and are free of congestion. Here the lungs and heart
have failed together, and the balance of the pulmonary circulation has been
fairly maintained.

   3. If the effect of the nitrite be more definitely prolonged, there is pro-
duced intense general congestion of the pulmonary vascular system, a con-
gestion so intense that the lungs, full of blood, clark and heavy, will not
float in water. The cause of death in this instance is progressive neural
paralysis of the pulmonary vessels ; it is the equivalent of congestion of the
lungs from long expose to extreme cold.

   4. The above may all be considered as acute changes in the pulmonary

structures, and the two first-named changes are immediately fatal. The
last need not be ; as it occurs from prolonged and siistained action of the

nitrite, in quantities insufficient to kill directly, the effects of sustained con-

gestion may be traced out from day to day for many weeks.
   To be accurate in the observations made on this subject, I constructed a

glass house or chamber of a capacity of three cubic feet, and so ventilated it
that the air could be kept charged with the vapour of the nitrite. In this
chamber rabbits and guineapigs were housed. They were carefully fed,
--154:

supplied -with abundance of air, and well protected from cold. The intro-
duction of the vapour was so moderated that the same quantity was made

to undergo diifusion each day.
   The first fact that became well established was, that cold and a low baro-

metric pressure greatly assisted the action of the vapour, and frequently led
to sudden death from congestion of lung and accumulation of fluid in the

bronchial tubes.

  A second fact, of singular interest, was the degree to which recovery from

extreme congestion of lung would take place, on simply withdrawing the
animal from the influence of the agent. A\Tien the lungs were so obstructed
that what is called rale fi'om accumulation of mucous fluid in the bronchial
surface was most marked, there was invariably a rapid recovery on removal

to fi-esh and warm air.

  A third fact relating to the lesions induced, beyond mere congestive lesions,

is also of deep interest. The lesions were primarily all of one kind ; they
were hjemorrhagic, and consisted of red spots and patches, in which blood
was effused and coagulated in the connective tissue. The position of the
hsemorrhage was singular. In three cases it was only in the extreme point
of the apices of the lungs ; in four other cases lower portions of lung were

involved, but in these the apices were the seats also of haemorrhagic disease.

It would appear, in fact, as if these points of lung were least resistant to the

force of the circulation.

   In the animals observed these distinct haemorrhagic changes were usually
fatal, so that the further result of the local neural paralysis could not be

carried out as could be wished. In two cases, nevertheless, we had other

results worth recording.

   In one instance there was clearly an oedema of the lung structure : in
another the pleural membrane was raised in four or five granulated points,
round each of which there was efi'used blood. Dr. Sedgwick, who took the

lungs of this animal for careful microscopic inspection, reported to me that

there were plastic exudations in various parts of both lungs, and that the

granulations of which I have spoken consisted of effused plasma beneath

the pleura.

I am well content to leave these observations as I have written them

above, with but two observations more. It has been suggested by an

accomplished and acute English physician. Dr. Eado, of Norwich, that

pulmonary consumption may be primarily due to pulmonary vascular para-

Mylysis.     experiments do not enable me at this stage to endorse Dr.

Eade's hypothesis as to the primary origin of consumption, but certainly

they indicate to what extent nervous deficiency wiU go in favouring the

hemorrhages, congestions, and exudations which attend tubercular disease.

The concluding observation this year with nitrite of amyl relates to the

fact that the nitrite atmosphere, when it is not too much charged Avitli

the vapour, exerts a certain curative efiect. Three rabbits were brought to

me with a skin disease resembling lepra in man. They were emaciated and

feeble, the fur on the back along the whole length of the spine had been cast

oil, and the skin was covered over this part with white asliy scales.

Placing these animals in an atmosphere of nitrite of amyl, I noticed that, as

the agent took effect, the scaly white skin on the back became red and

flushed. In a day or two the scales disappeared, the fur began to extend,
and the general health to improve. In a month all the animals had entirely

recovered.

   There are many local conditions of disease in man and other animals in
       PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION OF ORGANIC CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS. 155

·which the essence of cure lies in reestablishing a good capillary circulation.

It may be, therefore, that by administering the nitrite of amyl, or the other
organic nitrites, secundum artem, we may make them further agents in the

cure of disease, and thereby add another progress to physiological as distin-

guished from empirical mcchcine.

                                 Nitrate of Ethtl.

 myIn one of    previous Eeports I touched incidentally on certain of the

^

nitrates of the organic scries of compounds. These substances diflcr from

the nitrites simply in that they contain an additional equivalent of oxygen.

It is a very interesting study to follow the difference of physiological action

upon so simple a change of chemical constitution ; and this year I studied

once more this difference from two of the representatives of the nitrate

series, viz. from nitrate of ethyl and nitrate of amyl.

 Nitrate of   ethyl,  to  which  I  first  refer,  is  a                                       fluid, almost colourless,   and

_

yielding an agreeable odorous vapour. It has a specific gravity of 1-112, a

boiling-point of 85° C. (185° F.), and a vapoui-- density of 45. Its composi-

tion is C^ H. NO3. It is made by dropping 10 grms, of absolute alcohol into

20 grms. of colourless concentrate nitric acid in a platinum vessel surrounded

by a freezing-mixture. Mr. Ernest Chapman was kind enough to make me

a fine specimen of this nitrate, with which my experiments have been con-

ducted.

Nitrate of ethyl was used in experiment, physiologically, in 1848, by the late

distinguished Professor of Midwifery in the University of Edinburgh, Sir

James Simpson. Sir James considered that it possessed some anaDsthetic

properties.^ It has for many years, I may say centuries, also been used in

medicine, in combination with alcohol, under the name of nitric ether, and

so employed- has been considered valuable for its diuretic properties.

I find, on using it in the undiluted form, that it may be introduced into the

system either by inhalation, by hypodermic injection, or by the stomach, and

that the effects which follow its administration in large doses are closely analo-

gous to those induced by nitrite of amyl, i. e. it produces rapid action of the

heart, some pulsation of the vessels of the head, fliishing of the face, and

muscular prostration. In the strict sense of the word, it is not an anesthetic;

when administered in an extreme dose, there is no evidence of insensibility',

imtil death is imminent. In all cases the motor force is overcome com-

pletely long before the sensory organs are influenced. The paralysis of tho

vessels is slower than from nitrite of amyl; the danger of using the ao-ent is

consequently much less ; and as the eff'ects are more prolonged, the substance

becomes very manageable in medical practice.

 When    the    adniinistration  of the  nitrate   is                                          carried  up to death,  the  con-

_

dition induced in all the vascular organs is an intense congestion. In

this congestion the lungs and the kidneys specially share ; and I think'there

is no doubt that the well known diuretic action of the substance is due

altogether to the paralysis of the renal vessels it produces. It alters much
less than the nitrites the colour of the blood, interferes in no way with the

process of coagulation, and is eliminated rapidly from the body both by the
lungs and the kidneys. Administered to tho production of complete prostra-

tion, it reduces the animal temperature in a definite degree. In pigeons the
temperature goes down five and even six degi-ees, in rabbits three degrees,

and in gnincapigs from two to three degrees. Like the nitrites, nitrate of
ethyl  reduces
                the   tetanic  spasm of    stiychnia                                           and  I   would  suggest that in
                                                                                            ;

with great advantage; but it must be given for this purpose in very different

proportions to those in which it is now commonly i^rescribed. The best

plan would be to administer it by inhalation until a decided influence over
the motor action is manifested. In pharmacy it would be convenient to
keep the nitrite in the pure and simple state, leaving the dilution of it, in
alcohol, to the judgment of the physician.

                                            NlTEATE OF AmTL.

    Nitrate of amy!, C, H^^ NO3, is a pale amber-coloured fluid, of not very
agreeable odour. It has a specific gravity of 0-992, a boiling-point of 138° C.
(280° r.), and a vapour- density of 66°. It is made by acting with strong
nitric acid, 30 grms., on urea nitrate, 10 grms., adding afterwards 40 grms.

of pure amylic alcohol. I am again indebted to Mr. Ernest Chapman for

a specim.en of nitrate of amyl, freed as far as possible from nitrate of butyl,
from all trace of which it can with difficulty be separated.

   In the nitrate of amyl we have a substance differing chemically from

nitrite of amyl in ha\'ing an additional equivalent of oxygen, and differing
physically in that it is heavier and of higher boiling-point. It enters the
body readily by aU channels, and in its general effects it agrees with the
nitrite, except that a longer time is required for the development of sym-
ptoms from it, and a longer time is demanded for the process of recovery from
its influence. The quantity necessary to produce decisive results is the same
as with the nitrite ; but the nitrate is not so pleasant a substance to admi-
nister, and when administered by inhalation is not so conveniently applied.
"Whether the nitrate of amyl has any real advantages over the nitrite is a
question on which I would prefer not to speak at length, until larger oppor-
tunities than I have yet had of proving it have been afforded me.

                                                       SULPHO-TTREA.

   myIn last Eeport I treated on the physiological properties of certain of

the organic sulphur compounds, viz. sulphur alcohol, mercaptan, and sulphide
of ethyl. Recently a very curious and interesting sulphur compound has

come before me for experiment ; I mean a crystalline substance known by
the name of sulpho-urea. Sulpho-urea was first made, I believe, by Prof.

Ueynolds, and it has since been produced in London, in Dr. Thudichum's

laboratory, by Mr. Charles Stewart, to whom I am indebted for the speci-
mens with which I have conducted my researches. Unfortunately the
manufacture is difficult, owing to the necessity for many recystallizations, so

that I have only been able to work with six drachms ; but the results, as

far as they go, deserve notice. Mr. Stewart has kindly given me the fol-

lowing note in regard to the preparation of sulpho-urea :

   " About a kilogram of pure ammonium sulphocyanate is dried at 100° C,

powdered, and dried again. Slight loss by sublimation occurs. AVhen per-
fectly dry, it is heated gradually by a paraffin bath to 170° C, and maintained
at that temperature for two hours. The mass is then allowed to cool to
110° C, treated with one and a half times its bulk of boiling water, decanted
from a small quantity of black matter (it is impossible to filter it, as it de-
stroys paper filters), and set aside to crystallize. The crystals arc long, fibrous,
satiny needles ; they are drained, pressed strongly in Hessian cloth, and
purified by recrystallization from water. The product is then dissolved in

boiling alcohol, filtered from a little canmonmm sit?^^/i«^e which remains undis-
solved, and set aside to crystallize. Two more crystallizations from alcohol

rentier it practically free from sulphocyauato. The crystals from alcohol are
hard, opaque, white prisms : from -water they are long, fibrous, silky needles.
Both forms are anhydrous." I present specimens of both varieties.

   " Erom the mother liquors more of the urea may be recovered by the same

process. The last mother liquors, containing mainly sulphur urea, but also
much sulphocyanide, may be evaporated down, and heated again to 170°, as
above, with fresh sulphocyanide of ammonium, to furnish more urea."

   Sulpho-urea is much less soluble in water than ordinary urea, requiring
twice its own weight, at 60° F., for solution. It has a saline bitter taste,

compared by some to the taste of magnesian sulphate. It differs simply from
ordinary urea in that in it sulphur replaces oxygen.

Ur1eCaO'.*  USUu1lLp/hUo.U--uUrLe^a4 .

   In order to determine the difference of action of the two ureas, a series of

comparative experiments were carried out. The results may be thus epito-

mized :

   On frogs and rabbits sulpho-urea differs materially from common urea in
its action, i. e. when used in the same quantities. The first produces definite

convulsive action, with coma and convulsion ; the second produces, in frogs,
coma without convulsion, and in rabbits nothing more than a slight and gentle
soporific condition, which lasts for a very short time, and can be broken at
any moment by the simple act of moving or calling out to the animal.

   In frogs sulpho-urea induces the saline cataract, common urea does not.
   To produce any decided physiological effect with sulpho-urea, the proportion
used must not be less than thirty grains to the pound weight of the animal.
In three experiments in which it was administered to young rabbits, to the

extent of producing slight soporific effects, it reduced the animal tempera-
ture two degrees Fahrenheit within the interval of an hour.

    The impression I have gathered in respect of sulpho-urea is, that it is a

saline narcotic, and as such it may prove of use in medicine ; but the great

point of physiological interest in connexion with it lies in the difference
indicated, by its means, between the action of oxygen and sulphur in com-
bination with the same elements, C, N, H, in the same form. The difference

may be due to the difference of weight, or it maybe due to difference of solu-

bility ; the elements, oxygen and sulphur, producing the distinction by virtue

of their physical qualities of weight or solubility ; or it may be due to the

special qualities of the elements. I offer these thoughts as again bearing upon

the general question of chemical composition in relation to the physiological

action of chemical substances.

          CmOK-ETHTIIDENE MoNOCHLOETTRETTED CnLOEIBE OP ElHYLE.

    In the year 1852 Dr. John Snow introduced as an anaesthetic the mono-
chloruretted chloride of ethyle. He administered the vapour of this substance
many times to the inferior animals and to the human subject, and he came
to the conclusion that the vapour was equivalent in value to chloroform, and
had an advantage over chloroform, viz. that it rarely if ever produced vomit-

ing ; it did not usually excite the stomach, he observed, even if it were ad-

ministered after food. In 1870 the distinguished Liebreich, who evidently
was not aware of Snow's research, reintroduced this anaesthetic under tho
name of chlor-ethylidene. Chlor-ethylidene yields a sweet etherial vapour,
158 REPORT 1871.

less pungent than vapour of chloroform, but still pungent ; the vapour burns

in air. The specific gravity of the fluid is 1-174, the vapour-density 49, the

boiling-point 64= C. (149° F.). The composition is C, H, Cl^. It differs

from Dutch liquid, which in other respects it resembles, in not being de-

composed by an alcoholic solution of potassa (Snow).

I had already seen chlor-ethylidene in use in 18.52, and had added Snow'a

memoir upon it (during the writing of which, by the way, he was taken with

myhis fatal seizure) in  edition of his works on anoesthesia, published in

1858 ; but since the subject has come up again I have travelled once more
over the same ground. I obtained a specimen of chlor-ethylidene, adminis-

teredlt several times for the production of antesthesia, and am bound to say

of it that it is a very good autcsthetic. It resembles bichloiide of methylene

very much in its action, produces vomiting as rarely, but is less rapid than

the bichloride, being of higher boiling-point and yielding a heavier vapour.

On inferior animals I find that when carried to extremity it arrests the

respiration before it arrests the action of the heart ; and I also find that

myrecovery from its cxtremest effects is comparatively easy. In one of

lectures during the past winter session I restored life in a rabbit, by careful

artificial respiration, seven minutes and a half after all signs of natural re-

spiration had been abolished by the vapour of chlor-ethylidene.

I would give to chlor-ethylidene a prominent place amongst anaesthetics.

It would take the place of either chloroform or bichloride of methyleno

efiiciently ; it is safer than chloroform, and excites vomiting less frequently

it is less rapid in action than methylene bichloride, not more effective, and

possesses, I think, about the same value in matter of safety.

                                                Htdeamtle.

   At the Meeting of the Association at Exeter I placed before this Section a
fluid called hydride of amyl. The fluid had a specific gTa^dtv of -G^.^, and it
boiled at 30° C. (86° F.). Its composition was stated to be C, H^^ H. I de-
scribed then that this vapour was a quickly acting autesthetic.

   During the present year I have experimented largely again with this
hydride, vdth the view of rendering it applicable for the production of rapid
autesthetic sleep, for short operations, such as extraction of teeth. In
this research I found one or two difiiculties in the way. The fluid was
too light to be manageable on every occasion ; that is to say, it escaped
from the inhaler, as a gas, by the mere warmth of the breath, and the vapour
had also an odour which to the majority of persons was objectionable.

   I set to work to obviate these difficulties, first by slightly weighting the
fluid, and secondly by making an inhaler that should more effectually restrain
the liquid as it was undergoing evaporation. In both attempts I have suc-

ceeded well.

   In making good bichloride of methylene we put finely pulverized zinc into

a retort and pour upon it absolute alcohol and chloroform, using afterwards
a heat not exceeding 120° F., in order to distil over the product. I modified
this process by diluting the mixture of chloroform and alcohol with eight times
the volume of hydride of amyl. This mixture is poured upon the zinc,
with the result of an instant vehement action Avithout any application of
heat; after a free evolution of gas, which lasts some minutes, there dis-
tils by this method a fluid which contains pure hydride of amyl and pure
bichloride of methylene. If the distillation be carried on at 98° F., the fluid
that comes over has the specific gravity of ordinary ether (-720), a most

agreeable odour, and rapid anaesthetic action. I have now administered this
         PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION OF ORGANIC CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS. 159

fluid, in vapour, forty-six times for short operations on the liuman subject,
and in tlie average of cases have produced the required insensibility within
fifty seconds. In one instance insensibility was produced, a firm tooth was
extracted, and perfect recovery occurred in forty seconds. As yet there has
neither been vomiting nor other untoward symptom during the adminis-

tration.

    There is, however, a peculiarity in the action of this vapour to which I
ought carefully to refer, viz. that insensibility from it intensifies after the
inhalation of it is withdrawn. Thus in administering, whenever there is the
least indication of its effects, such as winking of the eyelids or drop of the

hand, the sigu is given to stop the administration. The operator may now

wait a few seconds and then proceed. The inhaler I have constructed for
the administration of this new anesthetic is before the Meeting. It is a simple
hollow cone made of leather, and is furnished with two light silken valves
for entrance of air and exit of vapour and breath. It is lined with domctte
set on a light frame or ring of metal. "When the inhaler is not in use it
forms a ease for holdiug safely, in a bottle, four fluid-ounces of the anaesthetic
liquid. This quantity is sufiicient for twenty operations, of from one and a
half to three minutes' duration, two drachms being the amount necessary
for an operation not exceeding three minutes' duration.

   The vapour described above will become, I believe, should experience
confirm its safety, of general apphcation as an anaesthetic for short opera-

tions; for long operations it will probably not replace the heavier anajsthetics.

1 am indebted to Mr. Ernest Chapman for the suggestion of the abbreviated
name hydramyle.

                            PHYSIOLOGICAL NOTES.

   In the course of the researches detailed in the preceding pages I have again,
as in iirevious researches, been led to notice certain simple facts which lie in
the path of inquiry, and which, though not necessarily belonging to it, are
too prominent to be passed by without notice. I shall therefore offer a few
notes bearing on three topics ;] and this the more readily, because it is rarely

the case that so many eminent physiologists as are now present, each one

interested in the subjects to be named, meet together to take part in dis-

cussion.

on the minute circulation of the blood. I prefer to use the term " minute

circulation " because it embraces the minute arterial and venous, as well as

the capillary circulation.

In these researches the web of the foot of the frog was selected for obser-

vation, and I think on the whole with advantage. The following particulars

were carried out in every case :

 A(a)  large healthy frog was chosen, and one in which the web was very

was conducted during the same hours each day, viz. between the hours of

2 and 5 p.m. (d) The observations were never hurried ; they occupied an
average of three hours each, and every change of scene in the vessels through

the various stages of narcotism and of recovery were carefully and systema-

tically noted, (e) The animals were placed for narcotism iu the small gLiss

chamber now before the Members. The chamber as it is was finally con-

structed, after many essays, by my friend Dr. Sedgwick, and it answered

admirably.  The animal was placed, without any restraint, iu the chamber
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

one foot was then gently drawn out on to the stage attached to the

chamber, and the web was extended over the small glass plate. The

animal being thus prepared, the web was brought under the microscope and

the circulation examined. (/) The part of the circulation to be observed
was so selected as to include a good view of an artery, a vein, and the

smaller intermediate capillary vessels,        "When the natural condition

                                         (ff)

of the circulation was well observed the chamber was closed by the sliding

cover, and through it the narcotic vapour, the effect of which upon the

circulation was to be investigated, was gently passed. The vapour was driven

over with hand-beUows from a small Junker's apparatus, manufactured by

Messrs. Krohne and Sesemann*. By counting the strokes of the bellows it
was possible to maintain the same current of vapour at all times. (7i) And

lastly, the web was sustained in the same condition of moisture, so as to pre-

vent errors of observation due to evaporation from the tissues.

Such were the precautions taken ; and I am inclined to think they were

mysufficient, although it will be a great satisfaction to me and an aid in  future

labours to hear of any amendments or additions that may be suggested.

The narcotic vapours used in the research were hydramyle, chloroform, bi-

chloride of methylene, and absolute ether. In some particulars these acted

precisely in a similar way, in other particulars they acted in a way more or

less peculiar to themselves.

   The first fact I would notice as common to the action of all the vapours

used is, that no obvious change in the physical characters of the blood-cor-

puscles, red or white, was ever observable ; neither was there any noticeable

difference in tlie relationships of the red and white corpuscles to each other.

The red corpuscles held their ways so long as there was motion in the centre

of the blood-streams, while the white ones rolled along by the sides of vessels

in the same manner as they did before the narcotism.

Another fact common to the action of all the vapours used was, that the

first sign of arrested movement of the circulation commenced in every case

on the venous side of the circulation, and consisted of a sort of pulsation or

to-and-fro movement of the current through the vein ; soon upon this the

venous current became obviously slower and the vein dilated, while the

arterial current remained, often for a long time, unchanged.

In every case the minute circulation remained long iu force after the

respiration had entirely ceased, and after all evidence of the continuance of

life had entirely ceased. On the average the animals ceased to breathe for

one hour and thirty minutes after the deep narcotism had set in yet all the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

while the minute circulation was still playing with more or less of efficiency,

and so long as it continued the chances of recovery were nearly certain. The

cessation of the minute circulation was, on the other hand, the sign and proof

of irrevocable death.

There was still another effect common to all the narcotics used. The cir-

culation through the capillaries often stopped altogether, and for considerable

intervals of time, when the reduction of the circulatory power was greatest.
Under this condition the circulation, such as it was, was maintained by the

arteries, in which the blood moved to and fro with occasional slow steady

and Junker'8 bottle, and showed the method by which it was worked.

onward movements. In tlie veins, too, there were now and then short move-

ments, fii-st as of impulse towards the heart, and then of retreat backwards
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

these movements in the veins were succeeded invariably by an increased and

more perfect action of the arteries. During this state the capillaries may bo

said to have become almost indistinct, that is to say, no movement of cor-

puscles through them, into tho veins, indicated their course ; as channels they
were left empty and transparent, and the return of the corpuscular current

through them was at all times proof of the speedy return of the activity

of life.

   The changes named above were common to the action of all the narcotics
named ; but there were some striking changes peculiar to the substances

themselves to which I must refer. The peculiarities were traceable, as it

seems to me, to the weight, the solubility, and the chemical composition of

the substance that was employed to produce the narcotic state.

   When the substance was very light, of low boiling-point, and insoluble,

the effect of arrest of the circulation was most rapidly developed, and at the

same time was most rapidly removed. Thus hydramyle, the lightest, the first

to boil on elevation of temperature, and the most insoluble, produced tho

quickest arrest of the venous current ; but from its influence the animal was

equally quick to recover, the general signs of recovery being secondary to

the local return of the circulation.

   When the substance was light and of low boiling-point, but comparatively

soluble in blood, the time required to produce the slowing of the venous cir-

culation was prolonged after the insensibility of the animal was complete

after even respiration had stopped, the extreme changes in the circulation

were slowly developed ; and although the insensibility might be deep and

continuous, like to death itself, the actual temporary arrest of the arterial

current was imperfectly pronounced. Absolute ether, which has a very low

specific weight (720) and a very low boiling-point (94° F.), but which is solu-

ble in blood to the extent of not less than eleven parts in the hundred, pro-

duced perfectly all the effects immediately named above. When the substance

inhaled was comparatively heavier, of a higher boUing-point, insoluble, and

contained as one of its elements an irritant, there was introduced a new

phase, that is to say, the arterial vessels, as the animal came under the in-

fluence of the narcotic, were reduced in calibre. The changes of the circula-

tion in this case were first marked in the retardation of the blood through

the veins, then the vein increased in diameter, and there were signs of

regurgitation of its blood; these indications were followed by what may

be called irregular movements in the capillaries, and by reduction of calibre

of the arteries. It was observed, nevertheless, that the narrowing of tho

arterial vessels, though well marked, was never so extreme as to prevent mo-

tion of blood in them ; that is to say, the degree of arterial contraction was
limited. I consider this to be due to the circumstance that the animal had

always ceased to breathe, and the further absorption of the narcotic vapour

had consequently also ceased, by the time that the action of the vapour upon

the arterial vessels was developed.

During the period when the size of the arterial vessel was reduced, the

motion of the blood in the capillary vessels fed by the arterial supply was

modified; the blood flowing through the capillaiy channels moved less

steadily, and was forced, if I may so express the fact, in pushes, as if there

were intervals of relaxation of the arterial vessels during which the resis-

tance to the impelling power of the heart slightly and slowly yielded.

After a time the circulation of the blood through the artery became slo^ver,

162 .              - REPORT-- 1871.

the capillaries were left empty, the venous current ceased, and the condition

of temporary suspension of all circulation, except slo-wly, in the arterial

supervened. The effects here named were well marked firom the action of

the chlorides ; they were seen under the influence of bichloride of methy-

lene, they were still more definite under chloroform.

   To sum up, if my observations be correct, the action on the systemic circula-

tion of the narcotic vapours named was seen to be primarily on the venous cur-

rent or, I should more correctly say, was primarily manifested in the retar-

dation of the venous current, secondly in the capillary, and finally in the

arterial current. During recovery, moreover, the return of a steady onward

current was manifested in the veins before it was restored in the capillary-

channels. This order of events coincides purely with the order of pheno-

mena of death under the influence of narcotic vapours, as observed both in
man and the lower animals. It is, I think, the invariable fact that the right
side of the heart in such fatal cases is the first to cease its action, and in
animals, when the heart is exposed to the air soon after the death, the right
side is the first to recommence action. From these facts the inference, I

think, is clear that the arrest of the circulation begins, during the narcotism,

in the retardation of the venous current, secondly in the capUlary, and

lastly in the arterial current.

   The course of recovery, when recovery takes place, appears to be preceded

by some act of relief to the venous column of blood. The motion that re-

mains in the arteries is not the fu-st to increase, the circulation through the

capillary is not first manifested ; that which happens, as a distinct sign of
recovery, is a movement onward by the veins ; as this movement improves
the movement through the arteries improves, the capillary vessels refill, and

the circuit of the minute circulation is steadily and perfectly restored.

   Prom these observations on the minute systemic circulation when the

body is under the influence of a narcotic vapour of the irritant class, I infer

that the changes of circulation observed do not proceed immediately from an

action exerted by the narcotic vapour upon the extreme systemic vessels, but

form an obstruction commencing on the venous side, and in the lesser or

pulmonary circulation. When a warm-blooded animal is suddenly killed by

a large dose of the vapour of chloroform, the lungs are invariably found

blanched, the light side of the heart engorged with blood, and the left side

Weempty of blood.  see in these conditions that of necessity, in the extreme

parts of the systemic circulation of the animal, there has been retardation of

the blood through the veins ; and we may iofer on the fairest, nay completest,

evidence that the return of motion, which is seen commencing in the veins in

the systemic circuit, is due to a returning current in the breathing-organs

in other words, the renewal of the active life of the animal recommences in

passive breathing. The same order of phenomena happens, precisely, during

the recovery of a warm-blooded animal, after apparent death from chloro-

form, under the influence of artificial respiration ; for so soon as the animal
recommences to breathe, however faintly, its return to life is seciu'ed.

   The position then assumed, that the primary arrest of the column of blood

during fatal narcotism is in the lesser circulation, we have to ask whether the

arrest commences in the heart or in the lungs. The commonly accepted
view has been that it commences in failure of the right side of the heart
but I incline to think that this view is incorrect, and that the positive source

of failure is in the peripheral circulation of the lung. The vapour inhaled

impresses, I think, immediaiehj the minute circulation, and acts not by

absorption into the blood, but by simple and instant contact with the minute
PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION OF ORGANIC CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS. 168

pulmonaiy vessels, so that there is immediate resistauco to the passage of

--blood through them. Three well-observed facts support this opinion : 1st,

the fact already dwelt upon, that in cases of rapid death the lungs are emptied
of blood ; 2nd, that the arrest of the systemic circulation commences on the
venous side of the circulation, and is attended with filling of the veins
3rd, that immediately after the death of the animal, if the chest be opened

and the heart exposed, the right side of the heart, relieved of pressure, will
immediately recommence to contract vigorously, showing that it is not itself
paralyzed, but is restrained from action by mechanical resistance to its column

of blood.

If the theory of the action of narcotic vapours thus propounded be cor-

rect, we ought to draw from it this practical lesson, that in introducing

new narcotic vapours into practice, the utmost care should be taken to select

those only that are negative in respect to their action upon the vessels of the

Aminute circulation.  gas or vapour that asphyxiates but docs not irritate

may be safer than a gas or vapour that does not asphyxiate and does

irritate ; for the former, when it kills, kUls by a secondary process that is

preceded by a series of symptoms foreteUing the danger ; while the latter,

Avhen it kills, kUls often by instantly shutting off the column of blood that

is making its way to the air, and by so oppressing the heart that every

attempt at action, under the condition produced, increases the injury.

                     Ojt CoirroxsiVE Movements ditring Narcoiism.

   I have endeavoured to show in the last section that under narcotism from

certain narcotic vapours, the vapours of the chlorine series specially, there

--are two orders of cessation of the circulation, the one primary, beginning in

the lesser or pulmonary, the other secondary, beginning in the larger or
systemic circulation. Coineidently with these changes I have, I think,

observed, when there has been time for the development of the phenomena,
two distinct series of convulsive movements or paroxysms of convulsion.

I have noticed the same fact in drowning, and also in fatal sudden haemor-
rhage, as in the process of killing animals, such as sheep. The phenomena

may at any time be observed at the abattoir ; they arc in fact perhaps best
seen in cases of rapid fatal haemorrhage ; and I am led to the conclusion that
they have one common interpretation as to cause, the hsemorrhagic convul-
sions being the purest tj'pe of all. The convulsive actions, primary and

secondary, are due, as it seems to me, to disturbance of the balance of supply
of blood to the -nervous and muscular centres. As a mechanism, the mass of
nervous matter is the centre of reserved force, while the mass of muscle is
the moving centre, the two centres being connected by an intervening nervous
cord, and each supplied with the same blood. The two centres are held in
counterpoise, as it were, by the blood. If there be, then, any disturbance of

support in either centre, it wiU be indicated in change of function in the
 moving centre, in change of motion.

   When we draw blood from the systemic circuit, or when through the

lesser circulation we arrest the free current of blood through the systemic
 circuit, we destroy the balance previously existing between the musciilar and
 nervous centres. If we could so exhaust the body that both centres should

 be exhausted together evenly, it is possible that there would be no change of

 motion in the moving centre ; and, indeed, in some cases of disease we see the

 gradual and equal exhaustion without manifestation of the convulsive pheno-
 mena. But in cases of extreme and sudden break of balance, it follows neces-
 sarily that the balance shall be broken unevenly. It is in the muscular system

                                                                   m2
--104 UEPORT 18ri.

that the failure of blood is first felt. The nervous centres, protected from the
 etfects of sudden pressure by tlieir envelopment of bony structure, feel the
 shock of the exhaustion secondarily. Thus the nauscle suiferiug a reduced
 resistance of blood to the nervous stimulus, contracts as if it had received an
excess of stimulus, and the phenomenon of primary convulsion is developed
 in haemorrhage this convulsion immediately precedes deliquium or syncope.
In brief time, the nervous centres themselves becoming exhausted, the con-
vulsions cease, and none but the muscular movements of the organic life,
respiration and circulation, remain. These while they last feed still in a
passive state the nervous centres and muscular centres ; and if the cause of
exhaustion at this stage be stopped and the body be resupplied with means

of life, recovery takes place without the necessary return of convulsive ac-
tion ; but if the exhaustion proceed, then follows the secondary phase, the

failure of the organic system, and with that a repetition of the phenomenon

of pi-imary failure, viz. a second general convulsion, terminating in death.

    The convulsion of haemorrhage is, I repeat, the typical form of the condi-
tions I have portrayed ; but in death from chloroform and similar narco-
tics, the phenomena are sometimes equally striking. The convulsion and
rigidity which mark the second degree of narcotism indicate the first
break of balance between the nervous and the muscular centres ; the
period of the third and fourth degrees of narcotism, during which there is
complete paralysis of voluntary and of conscious power, marks the interval
when all life is suspended on the organic or vegetative nervous system ; the
final convulsion that precedes death marks and proclaims the moment when
the organic force itself breaks down, leaving the whole organism motiouless
and, as wc say, dead.

 On Condensation of Wateb on the Bkonchlu, Subpace DtrEiNG Narcotism.

   It has occurred to mc often to observe that the physiological action of nar-

cotic vapours during inhalation is greatly modified by the condition of the

atmospheric air in respect to its dryness and its moisture. When the atmo-

sphere is extremely diy, the action of a narcotic vapour is greatly increased,

and recovery from its etfects is remarkably easy ; on the contrarj^ when the air

is saturated with water vapour the action is impeded; and if the air be at the
same time cold and moist, tlie process of narcotism is often greatly impeded,
while recovery after it has been established is prolonged in proportion.

But the fact I wish particularly to bring forward is, that when the body of

an animal becomes profoundly narcotized, and the insensibility is long main-
tained, during conditions in which the air is cold and moist, there occurs not
unfrequcntly an actual condensation of water in the minute bronchial pas-
sages, which condensation leads to as low asphyxia, and, if it be continued, to
actual death. This accident is best seen in cases of narcotic poisoning from

hydrate of chloral ; it may also be observed after poisoning from opium and

other narcotics, as well as after long exposure to extreme cold.
   There are two causes at work to produce the condensation : the one is the

obstacle to evaporation of watery matter from the surface of the animal
membrane into the air ; the other the deficiency of force, in an animal whose
general temperature is reduced, to raise the vapour of water from the blood,
and to expel it from the pulmonary organs in the state of vapom-.

   Whenever in any case condensation of water, from the causes named, is
set up, the danger continues in an increasing ratio ; for the condensation

tends to shut off the air from contact with the blood, the temperature of the
ON SECTIONS OF MOUNTAIN-LIMESTONE CORALS.  1G5

body (dependent always on the perfection of the respiratory process) decreases,
and at last the respiratory change is prohibited altogether.

   It is imj)ortant in the extrcmest degree to remember the fact thus named in
the treatment of cases of poisoning during which the animal heat is reduced. It

will often turn the scale, in such instances, in favour of return to life, simply

to place the body in a warm and dry air.
   The fact is also of great interest, in a practical and physiological point of

view, in relation to the phenomena of some exhaustive diseases. The cold
sweats that are seen on the surface of the body in syncope, in the later stages
of phthisis pulmonalis, and on the approach of death in many diseases, as

--also the chest-rattles, are due to the cause I have named'above condensation.

They are evidences that the body has not sufficient power or force to produce
a rapid natural evaporation of water from the exhaling surfaces.

Report of the Committee appointed to get cut and prepared Sections of
    Mountain-Limestone Corals for the purpose of shoiving their struc-
   ture by means of Photography. The Committee consists of James
   ThomsoNj F.G.S., ««(/ Professor Harkness, i^.ii./S'.

In our Report of last year we gave in detail the probable additions to our

present list of fossil corals from the Mountain Limestone.

   During the past year we have had several hundred specimens cut.
Although many of these have been more or less spoiled, and their internal

structure crushed and broken to such an extent that their specific characters

cannot with any degree of certainty be made out, yet many of them reveal

important structural characters which will enable us to add both genera and

species to those before indicated. Many of the specimens cut have well-

preserved calicos, which will enable us to figure and describe both their

internal structure and external aspect, with a degree of certainty hitherto
unknown.

   Although much progi'css has been made, we are convinced that many othei
facts will be revealed by further investigation ; and we hope the Committee
will be reappointed in order that we may continue this important inquiry.

  We have not added any additional photographic plates to those exhibited

last year at Liverpool. "We were desirous of getting as large a number of
specimens cut as the sum at our disposal would permit, in order that we
might select the most characteristic generic forms for further plates.

   At Liverpool we indicated that we were in the hopes of reproducing the

most delicate structures by another process, which would be more serviceable

for the purpose of publication. In this we are glad to state that we have
been successful. By a simple process we are enabled to transfer the details
of both genera and species to copper plates, from which any number of
copies can be reproduced, of which we will avail ourselves when we are ready
to publish in extenso. (Two plates so prepared were exhibited.)

   We have placed in the British Museum and the Hunterian Museum of

Glasgow duplicates of a number of the cut specimens which have already
been described ; other duplicates will be sent when they have been described
and named.

Second Report of the Committee appointed to consider and report on
   the various Plans proposed for Legislating on the subject of Steam-

 --Boiler Explosions, ivith a view to their Prevention, the Committee

   consisting of Sir William Fairbairn, Bai't., C.E., LL.D., F.R.S.,

   John Penn, C.E., F.R.S., Frederick J. Bramwell, C.E., Hugh

   Mason, Samuel Rigby, Thomas Schofield, Charles F. Beyer,
   C.-E.j Thomas Webster, Q.C, and Lavington E. Fletcher, C.E.

Since the first llcport on the subject of " Steam-Boiler Legislation " was pre-
sented to the Meeting of the British Association, held last year at Liverpool,
the Parlianientarj- Committee " appointed to inquire into the cause of Steam-
Boiler Explosions and the best means of preventing them " have presented

their Eeport.

   The consideration of the result of the Parliamentary Committee's inquiry
clearly becomes one of the most important duties in reporting to the British
Association on " the various plans proposed for legislating on Steam-Boiler
Explosions, with a view to their Prevention." Unfortunately, liowever, the

 Parliamentary Eeport has been so recently published that there has not been
time for its due consideration, or for the Committee appointed to treat on
this subject to meet and confer thereon. Under these circumstances it has
been thought best not to attempt to enter upon the subject on the present
 occasion, but to postpone doing so until next year, after having an opportu-

 nity of watching the development of the measure, and its working when
 carried into actual practice ; . and therefore, in order that they might be in a

 position to report thereon to the next Meeting of the British Association, the

 Committee would beg to suggest their reappointment.

Report of the Committee on the " Treatment and Utilization of Sewage."
   Consisting of Richard B. Grantham, C.E., F.G.S. {Chairman),

   Professor D. T. Ansted, F.R.S., Professor W. H. Corfield, M.A.,

   M.B., J. Bailey Denton, C.E., F.G.S. , Dr.W. H. Gilbert, F.R.S.,
   J&HN Thornhill Harrison, C.^., Thomas Hawksley, C.E., F.G.S.,

   W. Hope, V.C, Lieut.-Col. Leach, R.E., Dr.W. Odling, F.R.S.,

   Dr. A. Voelcker, i^.JR.>S., Professor A. W. AVilliamson, F.R.S.,

   F.C.S., and Sir John Lubbock, Bart., M.P., F.R.S. (Treasurer).

The Committee, upon its reappointment at Liverpool last September (1870),
proceeded at once to consider the subjects which seemed to demand imme-
diate attention in furtherance of the investigation which had been again

 entrusted to it.

    The first steps taken were to endeavour to procure information from the
towns where works have been constructed for the application of sewage to
land by irrigation, and from the places where the dry earth or Moule's system

is in operation.

    In order to commence the inquiry, a list of towns was prepared, to each of
which a printed form of queries was sent ; but only eight places have answered
the circular on irrigation, and only one that relating to the diy-earth process.
The answers from the towns have been tabulated, and the Table will be found
 at the end of this Report (Appendix A).

    During the construction of the present tanks at Breton's Earm in the winter,
 very accurate observations could not at all times be made ; but nevertheless,

 during the extreme fi'ost, samples were taken of the sewage and of the

 effluent water. The "temperature of both, and also the temperature of the
ON THE TREATMENT AND UTILIZATION OF SEWAGE.                                167

atmosphere, was observed. Similar observations -vvere madie at Croydon and

Norwood (see Section I.).

The observations as to the quantity and quality of the sewage and effluent

water have been continued at Breton's Parm, with slight interruptions, as
stated above, from the Meeting of the British Association at Liverpool down

to the present time. The results of the gaugings are recorded in the Tables

which will be found in Section II. of this Eeport.

The Committee has visited several sewage-farms, and examined the various

methods that are pursued at them with a view to determining the practical
conditions upon which the success of sewage-farming depends. They have

had samples of sewage and of effluent water collected, and have had analyses
made of them, which latter, with the remarks of the Committee, wiU be found

in Section III.

The phosphate process of Messrs. Forbes and Price has been also examined

by a Member of the Committee, and a description of the process, with an

analysis of the effluent water from this process, is given in Section IV.

   Analyses of the soil which has passed once and twice through earth-closets

have been furnished by another Member ; and the manner in which this

process is carried out at Lancaster, with the results attained there, is de-

scribed in Section V.

  An ox which had been fed for the previous 22 months entirely on sewage-

grown produce was slaughtered on July 15th at Breton's Farm, and the carcass

examined by Dr. Cobbold and Professors Marshall and Corfield, in the presence

of several Members of the Committee, with a view to ascertain the presence or
absence of Entozoa in any stage of their existence. The results of this exami-

nation, and Dr. Cobbold's report, will be found appended (Appendix B).

   The attention of the Conimittee has been drawn to certain anomalies in

ASection I.      Comparison of Results obtained in the purification of Sewage at

three Irrigation Farms during the severe frost of last winter.

                 1. Breton's Farm, near Romford.

   The following analyses show the composition of average samples of sewage
and effluent water collected on the farm on January 2nd ; each sample was
made by collecting five portions at different times, and mixing them in pro-

portion to the flow at the time.
168 REPOKT IS71.

   Tho sewage, after passing through the tank and pump, contains more sohd
matters in solution hut much less in suspension than the sewage as it comes
from the town ; the agitation causes some of the suspended matter to pass
into solution ; and it will be noticed that the amoimt of albuminoid ammonia
in solution is nearly doubled, showing that a considerable amount of nitro-
genous organic matter formerly in a state of suspension has been dissolved.

   This sewage is very much stronger than the average summer sewage,
which only contains from 2-5 to 4 parts of actual ammonia in 100,000 ; and

so one would hardly expect it to be so satisfactorily purified (especially, con-
sidering the extreme frost and the want of growth) as the sewage was
during the summer.

    Nevertheless the purification was very satisfactory indeed ; for the effluent
water only contained 0-143 of actual ammonia, instead of 5-628, while the
albuminoid ammonia was reduced from 0-524 to 0-059.

   Prom this we see that very little nitrogen passes away in the form of
ammonia or of organic nitrogen, even in winter, when vegetation has least

to do with the purification.

    Some of it passes away, however, in the form of nitrates and nitrites ; but
the amount which is thus lost is very little greater in the winter than in the
summer, being 1-208 part in winter and about 1-106 part in summer in

100,000 parts.
    Thus it appears that, with an underdrained soil, the sewage being obliged

to pass through several feet of soil before it escapes, (1) oxidation goes on in
winter as well as in summer, and almost all nitrogen lost is lost in an oxidized
and inoffensive form, and (2) this loss is very slightly greater in winter with

a very strong sewage than in summer with a weaker one ; so that sewagiug
in the winter would appear to entail no extra loss of manure.

                                    2. Beddington Farm, Croydon.

    Three samples of Croydon sewage, taken from Beddington Fields, 3rd Jan-
uary, 1871.

    The analyses show that the sewage applied to this farm contained on
January 3rd, 1871, just about the same quantity of ammonia as that applied
to Breton's Farm on tho da}^ before.
ON THE TREATMENT AND UTILIZATION OF SEWAGE.  169

sho-wing that the nitrogen that is lost on this farm is lost for the most pcart
in the form in which it came on to the land, and that mere surface-action

(which is relied upon here) is not sufficient to cause the oxidization of the
ammonia and organic matters contained in the sewage. At the same time
the amount of purification effected was certainly very considerable.

                                            3. N'orwood Parm.

   Samples of sewage and effluent water collected from N'orwood Fields on
January 5th, 1871.

   The sewage employed on this farm was very strong, containing as much
as 7*42 parts of ammonia in the 100,000.

--Eemarlcs oh Remits, of Oaugings, ^The whole of tHe g'augings taken from

the 12th of June 1870 to the ISth of July 1871 (a period of 399 days) havQ

heen calculated and tabulated, with the following results :

                                                                        ".

              =85,999,445 gallons 383,'926 tons,

and the number of days on which it has been delivered is 373, giving an

average quantity of

                              230,562 gallons^ 1029 tons per day.

This quantity does not, however, represent the total discharge from the

town of Romford, because, from the middle of Ifovember 1870 to the middle

of April 1871, the day-sewage only was delivered on to the farm, the night-

sewage being allowed to run on to the meadows at Wybridge between the

farm and the town ; and for sixteen days in February and March the whole

of the sewage was so disposed of, and there are no means of estimating the

quantity during this period.  _-
--Ilespective flow of Day- and Night-setvage. Since the 15th of April last,

the new tanks being completed, and the sewage, with a few exceptions, being

received continuously on the farm, it has been possible to calculate the re-,

spective flow of sewage during the working hours of the day and during the

remaining period, and the following are the figures :

                                      gallons.               tons.

=Day-sewage (average time 10 hours) ... . 139,153            621|

=Night-sewage (average time 14 hours) . . 143,645            641

                              Total   282,798 = 1262^

The day-sewage is calculated on the basis of gaugings in the sewer during

the working hours of the day ; the night-sewage is obtained by calculating

the difference of quantities in the tanks between the times of stopping the

pump one day and starting the next, allowing for the effluent water entering

the tanks in the meantime.

   By equalizing the time of day- and night-sewage (12 hours each) and

computing the quantities on the basis of the above figures, the following is

the result :

              Day-sewage, 12 hours     gallons.        =     tons.
              Night-sewage, 12 hours
                                      163,329          =     729
                                      119,469                533|

                                              282,798 = 1262|

According to these latter figures the night-sewage would be to the day as
79 to 100, or the day to the night as 137 to 100.

   It should be borne in mind that the night-sewagQ of Romford fluctuates
very much, owing to the Brewery frequently sending down a large quantity
of water after working hours ; this is especially the case on Saturday nights,

as a reference to the detailed records will show.

explained in the last Report, a certain amount of effluent water, which flows

 --Effluent Water discJiarr/ed. Owing to floods at the outlets of the pipes,

the quantities of effluent water discharged could not always be gauged. On

the 343 days during Avhich the observations could be taken,

=39,449,178 gaUon3 176,112 tons

were discharged, being

11.5,012 gallons=:513| tons per day.

Assuming this to be the average quantity for the whole period, the total
quantity intercepted from the lower subsoil and discharged through the pipes
would be

                             45,889,788 gallons =204,865 tons,

or 47-3 per cent, of the sewage pumped.

    Temperatures. It will bo seen that tho temperatures of sewage and effluent

water have been very uniform as compared with that of tho air, being lower

during extreme heat and higher during extreme cold. This was very notice-
able during the severe frost of last winter. In one week, when the mean

noon-clay temperature of the air was 28°-5, that of the sewage received,

--sewage pumped, and effluent water was 43°. The ranges of variation over

the total period have been :

                                              23

  A remarkable feature in the record of temperatures is the extremely slow

rate at which the temperature of the effluent water fell, and the length of
time which elapsed before it recovered again. The first week that tho
average temperature at noon fell below the freezing-point was the one ending

31st December, when the average temperature of the air was 28°'5 T., and

that of the effluent water was 43° ; and after this, although the former rose,
the latter fell, so that in the week ending February 4th the average tempera-
ture of the air was 36°, and that of the effluent water 41°. The next week
the temperature of the air was 44'-^, the second week 47°, and the third week
47°, yet it was not until the third week that the temperature of the effluent
water recovered to 43°.

--Section III. («) Observations on the Sewacie-Farm at Tunhrulye Wells.

   Before describing the results of the investigation by the Committee, it is
desirable to state that, in the selection of the land to be irrigated at Tunbridgo
Wells, it has been a sine qua non condition that it should be at such a level
that the sewage should reach it by gravitation ; and to this end two farms
       ON THE TREATMENT AND UTILIZATION OF SEWAGE.                177

have been laid out, one to the north and the other to the south of the town,
and an outfall server made to each.

    Underdrainage has not been uniformly adopted on both farms ; but where
it previously existed, a peculiar arrangement has been made for the reappli-

cation of the drainage-water.

   The distribution of the sewage is chiefly effected by what is known as the

catchwater system, which is necessarily, under ordinary conditions, accom-
panied by an overflow, in preference to its appHcation in smallei; quantities,
sufficient to satisfy the demands of vegetation and to wet the land thoroughly
without any overfloAv ; while the absence of storage -reservoirs necessitates
the continuous application of the sewage to some parts of the land by night
as well as by day.

   The population of Tunbridge Wells is 19,410.
   The total quantity of sewage discharged is 1,000,000 gallons per 24 hours,
of which about 400,000 gallons are supplied to the northern farm, and about

600,000 gallons to the southern one.
   The northern sewage is applied to 123 acres of land, which have cost

^21,000, and the southern to 167 acres, which have cost £27,000.
   To deliver the sewage from the two main outlets of the town to the land,

culverts or conduits, with precipitating-tanks for the separation of the
larger portions of the solid matter from the liquid, have been constructed in
a very substantial manner. The delivering-conduits on the north, extending
for a length of two miles with the precipitating-tanks, have costi<£258713s. Id.,
while those on the south (of which the length is three miles) have cost
.£5809 17s. 8d. The tanks on the north farm have cost ,£833 3s. 9d., those

on the south £1188 5s. Id.
   Thus the total cost of external delivering works amounts to £10,418 19s. 7d.,

which, added to the cost of the land, will be £58,418 lds.7d., or £201 8s. lid.

per acre.

   The solid matter collected in the tanks is removed from time to time, and
used on the farms as additional manure. The tanks are not covered ; and
there is consequently a strong smell in their proximity, which is not dis-
coverable in any other part of the farms.

   The sewage having been delivered on to the land, is conveyed from one part
to anotlier by open main carriers and iron pipes, the former following contour-
lines, and the latter partaking of the nature of inverted siphons in order to

cross existing valleys or hollows.

The cost of these internal works per acre has been

The soil of nearly the whole of the northern farm is of a stiff clayey cha-

1-acter, manifestly requiring underdrainage. It had for the most part been

drained by the late owners before the Commissioners of Tuiibridge Wells

purchased it j but owing to the work being done as ordinary farm-drainage

independently of surface preparation, it was soon found that the sewage
descended to the drains so rapidly as to prevent its profitable distribution on
the surface. It was stated to the Committee that when this effect was dis-
covered it was determined that the drains should be stopped by digging down
to them and plugging them, the result of which then was to keep the soil in
a state of saturation, and to allow the unpurified sewage to pass over the
surface into the stream. The engineer employed by the Commissioners has
since superseded this state of things by adopting the special mode of treat-
ment referred to, which consists of intercepting the existing drains at the
depths at which they were originally laid, and bringing the i;nderdrainage
water to the surface by outlet drains discharging into lower carriers for re-

distribution.

    At the time of the inspection by the Committee the lowest carriers were
receiving effluent liquid of an impure character from the surface, at the same
time that the underdrainage water was being discharged into them in the
way described.

    The land of the southern farm is not generally of so heavy a description
 as that of the northern, though portions of it contain clay. Other parts are
 peaty,, and are naturally very poor. Wherever the engineer has considered
 it necessary to drain the subsoil, this has been effected in a mannei" similar

 to that adopted on the northern farm.

    The striking features in the case of Tunbridge "Wells are :
    1. Instead of concentrating the sewage at one farm under one manage-
 ment, it has been divided, in accordance Avith the watersheds, into two parts,
 involving two separate systems of works and management.
     2 . The main conduits and carriers are more than ordinarily substantial,
 and are therefore expensively constructed ; and, following contour-lines on
 the surface, have a tortuous course, and so must interfere with approved cul-

 tivation.

    3. The character of the underdrainage, being designed for the redelivery
 of the sewage on to a lower surface by drains gradually getting nearer and
 nearer to it, must necessarily prevent alike a frequent and deep woi'kiug of

 the surface-soil.

    4. The sewage being run over the surface of the land on the catch-
 water system (by night as well as day), with the intention of reapplying the
 overflow, its distribution is necessarily unequal both in quantity and qualitj',
 the first land sewaged receiving more than it requires, while the last must
 suffer from a deficiency imless there is a positive waste of sewage, as the
 analyses really show that there is.

     These several features illustrate the advantage of combining with the
 services of the civil engineer and the chemist those of the practical agricul-

 turist when laying out a sewage-farm. If they were not pointed out by the

 Committee thus early in the progress of sewage-irrigation, they might be a

 source of disappointment and surprise to those who contemplate the utilization
 of the sewage of their own towns by this the most profitable mode of treat-
 ment at present known, when properly conducted. While saying this, it

 is desirable to point out the siiperior character of the works carried out at
 Tunbridge Wells, and at the same time to express approval of the enterprising
 manner in which they have been undertaken by the Local Authority.

      Eemarlcs on the Analyses of the Sewage and Effluent Water from the

--North Farm. In 100,000 parts. Samples taken in the proportion of -j-irW

180 REPORT 1871.

   The amount of ammonia in the effluent water is too high, amounting to
more than one seventh of that in the same volume of sewage, while albu-
minoid ammonia still remains to the extent of one fifth of the original amount
and the almost total absence of nitrates and nitrites in the effluent water
shows the want of conditions favourable to oxidation ; so that the jjurification
of the sewage here, although considerable, is not so satisfactory as could be
wished, or as might be effected by making filtration through the soil an essen-

tial feature in the process.

aged, more sewage is applied tiian can be purified by the surface-flow, even

when tbat takes place through thick vegetation (as in the case of the samples
from the fields of Italian rye-grass on the northern farm), and miich more

than can be purified under less advantageous conditions (as in the case of
the samples from the field of mangolds on the southern farm, although the
water from this field was mixed with that from two of meadow-land) ; and
they show, too, that the valuable matters that are not utilized are not only

thrown away, but are thrown away in their crude condition, not having been
subjected to the oxidizing action necessary to convert them into innocuous

nitrates and nitrites.

   Lastly, we must notice the fact that the temperature of the effluent water

of the northern farm is only slightly (less than one degree Fahr.) below
that of the sewage, while the effluent water of the southern farm is actually
half a degree Fahr. warmer than the sewage. This clearly shows that the
sewage has not been subjected to the cooling which percolation through soil

entails.

        (h) Ohservatmxs on ilie Sewage-Fann at Earlswood designed for the
                     Utilization of the Sewage of lied Hill and Eeigate.

    This sewage-farm consists of about 70 acres of Earlswood Common, of
which, it was stated, about 50 acres abutting on a tributary of the river
Mole have been laid out for irrigation. It is intended very shortly to add
more land to that already prepared from properties adjacent.

    The soil is for the most part a clayey loam. The higher ground next the

Common is rather freer in character, while the lower part appears to increase

in density as it nears the outfall.

    The surface, which has rather a steep fall in its higher part, gradually be-
comes more level as it descends, and has a very slight fall indeed as it ap-

proaches the outfall.
    Before the sewage is delivered to the land for irrigation it passes through

one of Latham's patent extractors, an ingenious invention for the separation
of the solid from the liquid parts. The liquid sewage is delivered from the
extractor by covered conduits, from which it is directed right and left into
the highest carrier. The land laid out for irrigation is divided into three
series of beds or slopes separated by roadways, on the upper side of each of
which is a surface-drain to receive the effluent liquid as it passes off the beds
above, and on the lower a main carrier to deliver the sewage for distribution
to the series of beds below. The three series are divided rectangularly into
nearly equal-sized blocks, to be again subdivided by minor or inner carriers,
laid out partly on the catchwater and partly on the ridge-and-furrow form.
The surface of the highest land of the uppermost series of beds is about 2-1
feet above the surface of the lowest land in proximity to the outfall-stream.

   None of the land is underdrained, and the lowermost beds appear to be in-

capable of uuderdrainage at a sufficient depth unless the stream receiving the
water to be discharged is appropriately deepened at very considerable cost.

   In answer to inquiries, it was stated that after heavy rains the lowest
portions of the irrigated lands are swamped by the backing of the water
Avhich collects on their surface when the soil itself is in a state of complete
saturation. At the time of the inspection by the Committee (July 11th), the
sewage had collected in pools on the surface of the irrigated beds in a man-
ner injurious to the crop under treatment. The work of irrigation is designed
so that the sewage applied to the higher land may be reapplied on the sur-
182 REPORT 1871.

face of lower lands with a view to its further purification. The sewage as it
passed off the fii'st surface was observed to be far from clear to the eye, and

it was not perfectly so when leaving the second surface. When it was ulti-

mately discharged at the outfall it was still cloudy, but this was partly
accounted for by the heavy rains of the previous day. The analyses of sam-
ples of efiluent water taken at different points, hereafter referred to, will show

the extent of purification effected.

    Though the land had not been drained, it gave indications of a natural
capabihty of drainage in the escape of the sewage from the sides of the car-
riers or drains, which are from 10 to 14 inches deep. The line of saturation
was clearly shown in those shallow cuts to be nearly identical with their
depth, and the liquid was seen oozing out of the land at some parts in a
clarified condition, and at others accompanied by a slimy matter, some spe-
cimens of which have been microscopically examined by Mr. M. C. Cooke,
M.A., whose report is here given.

Microscoiiical Examination of Slime and Mud from Bottom and Sides of

                               Carriers at Earhwood Farm.

The fluid specimen of deposit sent to me for microscopical examination was the

only one in a fit condition to report upon as to " the insects and animalcule to be

found therein." Obviously dried mud would give no satisfactory result as to living

animals, since the majority of them wovddbe dead and shrivelled beyond all power

of determination.

I have examined the wet deposit by the aid of the microscope, and find it to

contain a few Diatoms belonging to several genera and species, but in a compara-

tively small proportion to the volmne of material. The Desmidiaceaj were also

represented by a species of Closterimn, of which I detected but a few individuals.

Confervoid threads were also but sparingly scattered through the mass. Altogether

there was_ a smaller percentage of unicellular Algse than I expected to have

found. Living vegetable matter was comparatively rare.

  The animal inhabitants of the mud were numerous, especially of certain Muds.

There were a few examples of that common Thysanurous insect, Achorutes aqva-
                                                                 _

ticus, sometimes so plentifid in the liquid draining from heaps of manm-e. The

larvfe and pupaj of small Diptera I am unable to name in those stages, hut their

proportion was not large. OiEuglena viridis there was no lack ; and any stagnant

puddle, especially in the neighbourhood of farmyards, would have yielded an equal

proportion. Infusorians were scarce ; a few solitary individuals of Vorticella mi-

crostoma, and one or two specimens of Paramecitim, were about all that I observed.

But there was one gi-onp of animal organisms most abundantly represented, and

these were the Annelids. When the mud was exposed to the light and sun, the

surface became active with these creatm-es ; about the diameter of a piece of

cotton-thread, and from half an inch or less to nearly 2 inches in length, they

wa-iggled over the_ whole surface. Some white, others pink, and a few of a deep

blood-red were mingled together like eels, wriggling and scriggling in every drop

that coidd be taken up and placed on a slide for examination. Skins without in-

habitants were almost as plentiful ; and it seemed to be impossible to get a drop of

the material in the field of the microscope without either the worms themselves or

empty sk-ins.      (Signed)  M. 0. Cooke, M.A.

    It appears to the Committee that the existence of the exuded matter de-

scribed by Mr Cooke is mainly, if not whoUy, due to the fact that the subsoil

is kept in a saturated condition by the want of underdraining ; and they desii'e

to add their behef that with land thus saturated with sewage certain atmo-

spheric conditions exist which may be attended by malaria more or less in-

jurious to health. It need hardly be said that if the efiluent liquid passing

the Committee viewed the land), is not clear to the eye nor sufficiently-

pure to be admitted into rivers, there must be times when it may become

exceedingly objectionable.

   It is to be remarked in this case, moreover, that there was (on July
loth, 1871) more liquid passing off the land at the outfall than there
was sewage delivered to it for apphcation, due possibly to the passage of

the recent rainfall through the porous soil of the higher part of the farm.
This fact would, in the absence of the analyses of Dr. liusseU, have led
to the conclusion that the effluent liquid was purer than usual.

   This is decidedly a weak sewage, as it does not contain one third of the
quantity of " actual " ammonia, nor one fourth of that of " albuminoid
ammonia that the samples of Tunbridge WeUs (North Farm) contain ; the
--184 REPOKT 1871.

smaller amount of chlorine also shows this. The fact is, that a very largo

quantity of subsoil -water is admitted into the sewers.

   The effect of the " extractor " is to reduce the total suspended matters
by shghtly more than one third of their amount, the amount of solid
matter in solution is slightly lessened, and a quarter of the nitrogenous
organic matters in suspension pass into solution ; these arc effects not in any
way due to the action of the machine except as an agitator.

   The effect on this sewage of a flow over one field of rye-grass, as shown
by the analysis of an average sami^le made by mixing twelve samples
in the proportions indicated by the amount of flow at the time of collecting,

was as follows :
   The suspended matters, being very small in amount, were not determined.

The solid matters in solution were reduced in total amount, the reduction
being chiefly due, as in the case of the Tunbridge -Wells farms, to the re-
tention by the soil and plants of the more volatile substances, as the amount
of solid matters left after ignition is practically the same in the effluent
Avater as in the sewage. The lessening of the chlorine by more than one
fourth of its original amount would point to the fact, already referred to,
that a considerable amount of subsoil water dilutes the effluent water ; but
notwithstanding this dilution, the effluent water contains more than half as
much " actual " ammonia as the same bulk of sewage (after passing thi-ough
the extractor), and a quarter as much "albuminoid" ammonia, while the
amount of nitrogen escaping as nitrates and nitrites is insignificant.

   This effluent water is therefore not purified in a satisfactory way at all.

    But the most interesting point about these analyses is the comparison of
the effluent water which had passed over two fields of rye-grass with that

which had only passed over one.

   On a prima facie view, it would have been expected that the former
would have been much purer than the latter ; but in this case, on the con-
trary, we find that the effluent water which has passed over two fields

contains, in the same bulk,
    1. More than one fifth more solid matter in solution,
   2. More than one third more fixed solids,
   H. More " albuminoid" ammonia, viz. 0-10 instead of 0*06,

    4. Hather more chlorine,

    5. Very slightly less nitrogen as nitrates &c.,
    6. More than one fourth less " actual" ammonia, than the effluent water

--which had passed over one field of rye-grass.
    This shows us :

    1. That bypassing over an additional field, the sewngc has been strength-
ened instead of Aveakened, except as regards '' actual " ammonia.

    (That this strengthening is probably due chiefly to evaporation through
the agency of the plants, is shown by the increase in albuminoid ammonia,
and by the fact that the actual ammonia is the only constituent lessened in
amount to any extent.)

    2. That the nitrogenous organic matters, as shown by the amoimt of al-
buminoid ammonia, are increased.

   3. That no additional oxidizing action took place. These results are what
might have been anticipated from the description of the farm already given.

   The soil, not being underdraincd, is saturated with sewage, and the

effluent water flowing off one field on to another, already saturated with
sewage, can only concentrate itself by evaporation or by solution of matters
in the upper layer of the soil.
ON THE TREATMENT AND UTILIZATION OF SEAVAGE.  185

   There is this, then, against the catchwater-system, that if the fields are
not underdrained the laud will become saturated with sewage, and the
effluent water wlU then pass off in an impure condition ; and not only so,
but the present example shows that after a second application the water

may (except as regards actual ammonia) contain a greater amount of solu-

ble impurities than it did before ; and, above all, the nitrogenous organic
matter (as indicated by the albumenoid ammonia) is not diminished, but

rather increased, in spite of the active growth going on in the month of July.
   The temperature of the effluent water from the first field was considerably

(41° Fahr.) hirjher than that of the sewage, and that from the second field
half a degree higher than that from the first, a sufficient proof that percola-
tion through the soil does not take place.

   It may seem almost sujierfluous for the Committee, after so many years

of general experience throughout the country, to argue in favour of the sub-
soil drainage of naturally heavy or naturallj^ wet land with impervious sub-
soil for the purposes of ordinary agriculture ; but some persons have strongly

and repeatedly called in question the necessity of draining land when ir-

rigated with, sewage ; and the two farms at Tunbridge Wells, to a great ex-

tent, and more especially the E-eigate Farm at Earlswood, have been ac-
tually laid out for sewage-irrigation on what may be called the " satura-

tion " principle ; so that it appears to the Committee desirable to call atten-
tion to the fact, that if drainage is necessary where no water is artificially
supplied to the soil, it cannot be less necessary after an addition to the rain-
fall of 100 or 200 per cent. But a comparison of the analyses of different
samples of effluent waters which have been taken by the Committee from
open ditches into which effluent water was overflowing off saturated land,
and from subsoil-drains into which effluent water was intermittently perco-
lating through several feet of soil, suggests grave doubts whether effluent
water ought ever to be permitted to escape before it has percolated through

the soil.

              --Section 1Y. The Phosplmte Process.

  A Member of the Committee was present at an experiment which was

performed with the phosiihate process of Messrs. Forbes and Price at
Tottenham on March 25th, 1871. His description of the experiment is as

follows :

    The Tottenham sewage, after passing through some depositing tanks which
had been constriicted for the lime-process, was pumped up, at the rate of
about 800 or 1000 gallons per minute (as stated), along a carrier into a tank
100 yards long and of gradually increasing breadth. This tank took three

hours to fill.

    As the sewage passed along the above mentioned carrier, the chemicals
were mixed with it in the following way :

   Two boxes were placed over the carrier, one a few yards further along it

than the other; the first contained the phosphate mixture, and the second

milk of lime. Men were continually stirring the contents of each box,

w'hich were allowed to run continuously into the sewage as it passed xmder-
ncath the boxes.

    The phosphate mixture was stated to be made by powdering the native
phosphate of alumina, mixing it with sulphuric acid in the proportion of a
ton of phosphate to from 12 to 13 cwt. of the acid, and dissolving the mass

in water.
186                        REPORT 1871.

   The amount of the preparation added to the sewage -was not ascertained,
but it was stated to be certainly much less than the proportion indicated by
previous experimeuts (1 ton of crude phosphate to 500,000 gallons of sewage).

    The result of this addition was to deodorize the sewage to a very consider-
able extent indeed ; and when some of it was placed in a precipitating glass,
and allowed to stand, a speedy separation of the suspended matters took

place.

   The milk of lime is added to precipitate the excess of phosphate added,
and just sufficient milk of lime is allowed to flow in to neutralize the sewage,
the reaction of which to test-paper is observed from time to time after the
addition of the milk of lime.

    During the passage of the sewage thus treated through the large tank,
the suspended matters were verj- completely deposited, and the supernatant
water ran over the sloping edge of the tank at its extreme end bright and
clear, and almost odourless.

   Some of this water was collected, and was kept sealed up in a stone jar
tintil July 24th, when it was analyzed by Dr. llussell, with the following

result :

   Sample of Effluent Water taken from Tottenham Sewage, treated March

                                     25th, 1871. Parts per 100,000.

Solid matter in solution.
ON THE TREATMENT AND UTILIZATION OF SEWAGE.  187

in -whicli case the milk of lime -would not be added, and the clarified sewage
would still contain a quantity of phosphoric acid.

   The advantage of this use of it, if it were found to answer from an econo-
mical point of view, would be the deodorization of the deposit in the tanks
and of the sewage itself, which is certainly at present a great desideratum,

especially as regards the tanks.

                         Section Y.--The Dry Earth System.

   The Committee did not consider that it was its duty to undertake the
examination of every plan that might be proposed for the treatment or i\ti-
lization of exeretal matters, but only those which were already well before
the public, and known, or supposed, to be affording something like satisfactory
results. It had sent out forms of questions with a view of procuring in-

formation respecting the results obtained in the use of Moule's earth-
closets, and there was every desire on the part of the Committee not to
neglect the examination of any system which promised results satisfactory to
the community.

    Of eight forms of questions sent out relating to Moule's system, only one
had been filled up and returned, and that one was from Lancaster. It ap-
peared that about 2| lbs. of soil were used per head per day. The manure
obtained is afterwards mixed with other town refuse, and the mixture is sold
at 5s. a ton. The analysis of the manure published by the Rivers Pollution
Commission showed, however, that it did not contain more nitrogen than
good garden-mould. It was stated to have been applied at the rate of about
6 tons per acre to grass land ; but the produce of hay was by no means large.
It should be added, however, that even at Lancaster, the only place where an
attempt has been made to carry out the system on a large scale, some of the
conditions prescribed by Mr. Moule, and essential to its success as a means of
avoiding nuisance and injury to health, are entirely neglected. · Thus there
is an average of twenty-four persons using each closet ; and instead of any
arrangement for the deposit of earth on the fsecal matters after every use of
the closet, a quantity of soil is thrown once a day over the matters collected

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

 and the result is, that the product is removed in a very offensive condition.

    On behalf of the Committee, Dr. Gilbert has himself made some trials "with

Moule's earth system: 14 cwt. of air-dried and sifted clayey soil were set

apart for the experiment. Prom one third to one half of the whole was used
before it was necessary to empty the pit. When removed the mass appeared

uniformly moist throughout, and (excepting in the case of the most recent
portions near the surface) neither fascal matter nor paper was observable in it
nor was the process of emptying accompanied by any offensive smeU. After
exposure and occasional turning over on the floor of a shed, the once-used
soil was resitted, and again passed through the closet.

    Below are given the percentages of moisture and of nitrogen in the soil
under the various circumstances of the trial :
188 KEroiiT-- 1871.

nitrogen was only about 0-15 each, time the soil was used ; and, even after
using twice, the soil was not richer than good garden-monld. It is obvious,
therefore, that such a manure, even if disposed of free of charge, would bear

carriage to a verj' short distance only. It may be added that the percentage

of nitrogen in the soil after using once, as given above, agrees very closely
with that recorded in the report of tlio Eivers Pollution Commissioners, as

found by them in the manure obtained, under professedly the same system,

at Lancaster.

   In conclusion, when it is borne in mind how small is the proportion of the
nitrogen voided in the 2-1 hours that is contained in the faeces, how small is
the proportion of the total uriue that is passed at the same time, and how great
is the dilution of the manurial matters bj'^ the amount of soil required, it is by
no means surprising that the manure produced is of such small value as the

results would show. It is obvious, too, that our domestic habits and practices
would have to be cntii'ely revolutionized to secure the coUeetion and absorp-
tion of the whole of the urine, which contains by far the larger proportion of
the valuable mani;rial matters voided. Moreover, assuming 2 or 2| lbs. of
soil to be required for each use of the closet, if the whole of the liquid, as
well as the solid excretal matters, were to be absorbed, there would pro-
bably be required from 9 to 10 lbs. of soil per head per day, or about 1| ton
per head per annum. This, for London, taking the population at three and
a quarter millions, would represent a requirement of about five million tons
of soil per annum, or nearly 14,000 tons per day ; and the quantity to bo
removed would, of course, be considerablj^ greater. This illustration is
sufficient to show the impracticability of any such system for large popula-

tions. Nevertheless it may readily be admitted that it would be of great

advantage, in a sanitary point of view, in the cases of sick rooms, detached
houses, or even villages, and that it might be even economical where the earth
for preparation and absorption, and the laud for utilization, are in close

proximity.

                    Iiej)ort on tJie Post-mortem Examination of an Ox.

                         By Dr. T. Spencer Cobbold, F.E.S.

   Tour Committee having invited me to examine the carcass of an ox fed

for two j-ears past on sewage-grown grass at Mr. Hope's farm near llomford,
I have to report the perfect freedom of that animal from internal parasites
of any kind.

    I attribute this marked negative result to the following circumstances :
First, the animal did not graze on the farm, but was fed exclusively upou
vegetable products cut and carried from the land. Secondly, the porous na-
ture of the soil and subsoil alike would rapidly carry off the sewage, and thus
ensure the passage of parasitic germs into the soil itself. Thirdly, I noticed
on the irrigated portions of the farm a remarkable absence of those-molluscan
and insect forms of life which frequently play the pai't of intermediary
bearers. Fourthly, the only moUusks I detected were examples of Lijmncus
pereger ; these were obtained from a small pit of water to which the sewage
had no access, and when examined after death were not found to contain

any cercarian larvaj. Fifthly, the flaky vegetable tufts collected by me

from the sides of the furrows occupied by sewage-currents consisted chiefly
of Batracliospermiim moniliforme, in the filaments of which were numerous
active free nematodes, but no ova of any true cutozoou. Sixthly, the sewage
had a strong smell of beer, suggesting the presence of sufficient alcohol to
                                                                                ',

LETTERS FROM M. LAVOISIER TO DR. BLACK.                                                                                   189

destroy the vitality of ordinary parasitic germs, though it was abundantly
manifest that the free nematodes had suffered nothing in consequence.

   As some guarantee for the efficient manner in which the carcass of the ox
was examined, I may mention that the superficial muscles, with their asso-
ciated areolar and aponeurotic coverings, were particularly investigated,

portions of certain muscles, such as the scaleni and sterno-maxillaris, being
dissected through and through. All the viscera were likewise scrutinized,

especially the brain, lungs, liver, bladder, kidneys, paunch, reed, caecum, and
other natural divisions of the intestinal canal. The animal was not exces-

sively fat, whilst its muscles were well developed and of a deep carneous lustre.

84 Wimpole Street, London,                                                                    T. Spencek Cobbold, M.D., F.E.S.
            July 18, 1871.

                                                                                              Remarlcs hy the Committee.

   With regard to the examination of the carcass of the ox, which had been
fed for twenty-two months on sewaged produce at Breton's Farm, those mem-
bers of the Committee who were present and examined it with Dr. Cobbold

concur in his statement as to its perfect freedom from internal parasites of
all kinds; and they can also subscribe to most of his observations with regard
to the possible reasons for this immunity. They wish especially to draw at-
tention (1) to the fact, that on this farm there is " a remarkable absence of
those molluscan and insect forms of life wliich frequently play the part
of intermediary bearers " to entozoal lax-viE : it would appear that the sewage
drives these creatures away or kills them ; and (2) to the composition of the
" flaky vegetable tufts " collected from the sides of the carriers ; these contained
" numerous active free nematodes, but no ova of any true entozoon."

   But the Committee cannot support the opinion expressed by Dr. Cobbold^

that the strong smell of beer which the sewage had (caused of course merely
by hop waste) would suggest " the presence of sufficient alcohol to destroy

the vitality of ordinary parasitic germs," as the quantity of alcohol which
would be necessary for this purpose in so large a bulk of sewage would be
enormous, and especially as, as Dr. Cobbold says, " it was abundantly mani-
fest that the free nematodes had suffered nothing in consequence."

    It appears, then, that, as far as this one case goes (and it is certainly as con-

clusive as a single case could possibly be), there is no evidence that entozoal
forms of life are to be found on the farm at all in any stage of their existence,
or in the flesh of an animal fed exclusively for twenty-two months on sewaged
produce grown on the farm.

le premier gcrme : si vous avez la bonte de dormer quelques instants a sa
lecture, vous y trouverez le devcloppement d'une Doctrine nouvelle que je
crois plus simple et plus d'accord avec les faits que' celle du Phlogistique. Ce
n'est au surplus qu'en trcmblant que je le soumets au premier de mes juges
et a celui dont j'ambitionnerais le phis le suffrage.

                                                   J'ai I'honneur d'etre tres-respectueusement,

vous avez si glorieusement suivie. Votre approbation. Monsieur, dissipe mes

inquietudes et me donne un nouveau courage.

   Cette Lcttre, Monsieur, vous sera remise par M. Tcrray iutcndaut de Lyon

neveu du Ministre des finances de ce memo nom et mon parent ; il conduit a
Edimbourg son fiJs, jeune homme d'esperance et destine a posseder une grande

fortune, pour y finir son education et suivre les lemons des profcsseurs celebres

de I'universite d'Edimbourg. Permettcz-moi, Monsieur, de vous le recom-

mander. L'interct que vous voudrez Hen prendre a lui sera un premier titre

qui I'annonccra d'une maniere avantageuse et j'ai lieu de croire qu'il ne se
rendra pas indigne de vos bontes.

   Je ne serai pas content jusqu'a ce que les circonstanccs me permettent de
vous aller porter moi-meme le temoignage de mon admiration et de me ranger
au nombre dc vos disciples. La revolution qui s'opere en France devant na-

turellement rondrc inutile une partie de ceux attaches a I'ancienne adminis-
tration, U est possible que je jouisse de plus de liberte ; et le premier usage
que j'en ferai sera de voyager et de voyager surtout en Angleterre et a Edim-
bourg pour vous y voir, pour vous y entendre et profiter de vos lumieres et
de vos conseils.

   J'ai commence un grand nombre d'ouvrages et de travaux et j'asjiire a un
Etat de tranquillite qui mo permctto d'y mettre la derniore main.

LETTERS FROM M. LAVOISIER TO DR. BLACK.  191

                                                                                  Paris, le 19 Novcmbre, 1790.

   M. Teeeay, Monsieur, m'a remis, eu arrivant a Paris la lettre que vous
m'avez fait I'honneur de m'ecrire le 2-1: Octobre ; il ne pouvait me faire un
present qui me fiit plus agreable. J'ai era que vous ne desapprouveriez pas
que je la commuui(iuasse a 1'Academic des Sciences ; elle n'a pas moins admire
I'elegance du style que la profondeur de philosophie et la candeur qui regne
daus voire lettre, et elle a meme desire qu'elle fiit dcposee dans ses registres
mais je n'y ai consenti, qu'a condition qu'il m'en serait remis une copie cer-
tifiee du secretaire. J'ai une autre grace a vous demander, mais sui" laqueUe
je dois attendi-e votre aveu ; c'est de vouloir bieu me pei'mettre d'en publier

la traduction dans les Annales de Cbimie.

   M. Gillan a etc temoin, depuis son sejour a Paris, de quelqucs experiences
que j'ai faites sur la respiration et il a bien voulu y concourir. Nous nous
sommes assures des faits suivans :

    1°. La quautite d'air vital ou gaz oxigene qu'un homtne en repos et a
jeun consomme, ou plutot convertit en air fixe ou acide carbonique, pendant
une hcure est de 1200 ponces cubiques de France environ, quand il est place
dans une temperature de 26 degres.

   2°. Cette quantite s'eleve a 1400 pouces, dans les memes circonstances, si

la personne est placee dans une temperature de 12 degres seulement.
    3°. La quantite de gaz oxigone consommee, on convertie on acido carbo-

nique, augmente pendant le tems de la digestion et s'eleve a 1800 ou 1900

 pouces.

    4°. Par le mouvement et I'exercice ou la porte jusqu'a 4000 pouces par

heure et meme davantage.
    5". La cbaleur animale est constamment la meme, dans tons ces cas.

    0°. Les animaux peuvent vivre dans de I'air vital ou gaz oxigene, qui ne
 se renouvelle pas, aussi longtems que Ton le juge a propos, pourvu qu'on ait

 soin d' absorber, par de I'alcali caustique en liqueur, le gaz acide carbonique,

 a mesure qu'il se forme ; en sorte que ce gaz n'a pas besoiu, eomme on le

 croyait, pour etre salubre et propre a la resj)iration d'etre melange avec une
 certain e portion de gaz azote ou Mopbcte.

    7°. Les animaux ne paroissent pas souffrir dans un melange de 15 parties

 de gaz azote et d'une partie de gaz oxigene, pourvu qu'on ait de meme la

 precaution d'absorber le gaz acide cai-bonique, par le moycn de I'alcali
 caustique, a mesure qu'il est forme.

    8". La consommation du gaz oxigene et sa conversion on acide carbonique

est la meme dans le gaz oxigene pur et dans le gaz oxigene mele de gaz

 azote, en sorte que la respiration n'est nullement acceleree en raison de la
 purete de I'air.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. Anton Dohrn^ Professor
    RoLLESTONj a7id Mr. P. L. Sclater, appointed for the purpose of

 --promoting the Foundation of Zoological Stations in different parts

   of the World: Reporter, Dr. Dohrn.

The Committee beg to report that since the last Meeting of the British
AssociatioQ at Liverpool steps have been taken by Dr. Dohrn to secure the
moral assistance of some other scientific bodies, and that the Academy of

Belgium has passed a vote acknowledging the great value of the j^roposed
Observatories. Besides this, the Government at Berlin has given instruction
to the German Embassy at Florence and to the General Consul at Naples to
do everything to secure success to Dr. Dohrn's enterprise. Next October
the building at Naples will be commenced under the personal superintendence

of Dr. Dohrn, who will be accompanied by the assistant architect of the
Berlin Aquarium. The contractors agree to finish the building in one year,
so that in January 1873 the Aquarium in Naples may be expected to be in

working order.
    The Naples Observatory being thus arranged for, the Committee beg leave

to draw the attention of the British Association to the importance of esta-
blishing a Zoological Station in the British Islands, and to the opportunity

which is now offered for such a proposition in consequence of the cessation

of the grant to the Kew Observatory. In the same way as the Association

took the initiative in the foundation of the Meteorological Observatories, so

may they legitimately and with every prospect of success take in hand the

foundation of Zoological Observatories. Until a recent date the Association

has given considerable sums of money to dredging-explorations ; but, in con-
sequence of the advance of Zoological Science, some of the problems to be
solved are so much changed and their nature is of such a character as to
demand the assistance of the Association in other directions. The careful
study of the development and the habits of marine animals can only bo
 carried on by aid of large aquariums and cumbrous apparatus, which an
individual could hardly provide for himself. This, and the copious supply
 of animals for observation, can be pro^ided by such a cooperative institution.
 There can be little doubt of the convenience to naturalists, and of the per-
manent benefit to science, which would result from the foundation of a

 Zoological Station in the British Isles.
       THERMAL EQUIVALENTS OF THE OXIDES OF CHLORINE,  193

    Preliminary Report on the Thermal Equivalents of the Oxides of

                    Chlorine. By James Dewar, F.R.S.E.

During tlic course of the last Meeting of the British. Association, I took
occasion to lay before the Chemical Section two short notes bearing directly
on the subject of Thermal Equivalents ; they were respectively entitled
" Thermal Equivalents and Fermentation/' and " Observations on the Oxides
of Chlorine." In the first-mentioned communication it was proved that the
decomposition of sugar into carbonic acid and alcohol was a reaction taking-
place without any great evolution of heat, if we accepted the thermal equi-
valent of sugar as determined by Frankland, along with the similar value
of alcohol obtained from Eavre and Silbermann's researches ; and con-
sequently the heat of fermentation must be derived from some other source

--than the sugar molecule itself, the continued hydration of the alcohol pro-

duced, the secondary decompositions taking place, and the transformations

of the ferment itself being the three available sources of supply.

   The note on the oxides of chlorine had special reference to the heat
evolved during the decomposition of these oxides. The researches of Eavre
and Silbermann having shown that the formation of hypochlorous acid and
of chloric acid is attended with a large absorption of heat, it became in-
teresting to ascertain if in this series of oxides we had a regular increment
of absorption in passing from the lowest member of the series to the highest
member, just as Andrews had found a similar relation to hold for certain
oxides of the same metal, whoso successive formation was attended with an
evolution of heat. I suggested it would be interesting to make a complete
examination of the thermal relations of these bodies aloag with the similar
derivatives of bromine and iodine, and with this object in view I ac-

cepted a grant in order to prosecute these researches ; and although my

spare time has been variously occupied during the past year, I have found

opportunity to make a considerable number of prehminary observations in

connexion with this subject.

Comparing the solution-values of chloride of potassium and bromide of

potassium vdth the corresponding values obtained for the chlorate and

bromate, the latter salts are observed to have a very much higher solution

thermal equivalent ; whereas, comparing iodide of potassium with iodate, we

have only a slight increase in the latter salt. The highest absorption-

values are therefore connected with the acids whose formation is attended

with an absorption of heat. It will be interesting to find how these sub-

stances act with regard to the absorption of radiant heat, and if a similar

relation is maintained.

The method I proposed to adopt in examining the thermal relation of the

oxides of clilorine was based on the easy and rapid decomposition of dilute h)^-

driodic acid, whoso thermal equivalent in aqueous solution has been carefully

determined. I soon found, however, chloric acid did not appreciably decom-

pose dilute hydriodic acid when the strength of the respective acids in

aqueous solution amounted to a half gramme equivalent per litre, nor did I

Asucceed better when I substituted hydrochloric acid for the hydriodic.

few experiments were made on the action of magnesium on chloric acid,
with the view of ascertaining its thermal value from the oxidation of the

nascent hydrogen ; but, so far as my experiments extended, the results did

not agree satisfactorily.
   I had recourse then to the direct action of iodine on chloric acid, which

I found acted easily on a solution of tvnce the normal strength, at a tempe-
rature of SO'' C, although it did not act on a dilute aqueous solution in the
cold. The reaction only taking place readily at a temperature of 80° C,

complicates very much the mode of procedure, necessitating, as it does, a

very constant temperature.

  A series of observations gave as a mean 35,500 heat units evolved per

equivalent of iodine acting on excess of chloric acid. This number repre-

sents the heat evolved in the transformation of chloric acid into iodic acid

and by subtracting from it the thermal value of the latter acid, we obtain

the heat evolved from the decomposition of the chloric acid. The thermal

value of iodic acid is very readily obtained through the reaction of dilute

hydriodic acid, thus

                      IOg + 5HI=5HO + 6I,

which takes place with extreme rapidity in dilute solution, evolving 10,000

units per equivalent of hydriodic acid dccom2:)Osed.

   Assuming, then, the thermal value of hydrogen to be 34,000 units, and that

of hydriodic acid to be 15,000, we obtain on calculation 15,000 units evolved

during the formation of a molecule of iodic acid in aqueous solution. This

number agrees vciy closely with that of A. Ditto's for the formation of iodic
acid as found through the oxidation of phosphorus. Subtracting the number
found for the formation of dilute iodic acid from the former number ex-
pressing the action of iodine on dilute chloric acid, we have the number

20,500 left for the thermal value of dilute chloric acid. Favre estimated

the thermal value of dilute chloric acid as high as --65,234 per equivalent

this result being based^'ion the action of chlorine on concentrated caustic

potash, thus,

                      6E:0 + 61=5KC1+KC103,

and inserting in the equation the known values of oxide of potassium and

chloride of potassium, and further correcting for dilution. It is obvious,

however, where we have one atom of a compound formed for five atoms of
another whose thermal value is not very accurately known, we multiply

any error enormously.
   In looking over Favre's original paper, in the * Journal de Pharmacie ' for

1853, on this subject, I observed that he mentioned a very ciuious observa-
tion with reference to the heat evolved during the saturation of hypochlorous

acid with dilute oxide of potassium. He shows that an equivalent of

caustic potash, when neutralized with an equivalent of hypochlorous, gives

rise to an evolution of 10,768 heat imits ; but if two molecules of hypo-
chlorous acid were employed per equivalent of caustic potash, he found an
evolution of 22,114 heat units. The additional heat evolved is not due to the
formation of an acid salt, because, on adding another atom of caustic potash^

we obtain the normal amount of heat due to the saturation of the acid. It

is reasonable to suppose, tlierefore, that the additional atom of hypo-

chlorous acid induces the followin-^go reaction :

                             3K0 C10=2KC1+K0 C10,,

the purity of the aqueous solution, that the acid be previously lique-
fied, and its vapoiir pasfsed slowly into water, as has been recommended

by Brandeau. As the cold weather had all vanished before I could secure
time to enter on this investigation, I saw it was hopeless to prepare the

--liquid acid readily and thus ensure a pure product, but made a few observa-

tions on the purest product I could obtain the highest number I have
obtained per equivalent of chlorous acid, ClO^, acting on hydriodic acid
amounting to 111,000 units, the following reaction taking place, thus,

                        C103-f-4HI=HCH-3H0 + I,.

    It is easy to calculate the heat absorbed during the formation of dilute

chlorous acid, and it is found to amount to --27,800 heat units.
   Similar observations have been made on peroxide of chlorine obtained

from the action of oxalic acid on chlorate of potash. The aqueous solution
of the gas has always contained appreciable quantities of free chlorine, and
the value obtained will necessarily require some correction. One equivalent
of ClOj acting on hydriodic acid evolves 120,000 heat units ; the following

reaction takes place :

                         C10,-1-5HI=HC1 + 4H0+L.

When the requisite numbers are inserted in the above equation, the result

is found to be 19,800 heat units absorbed for the formation of an equivalent

of peroxide of chlorine.

The thermal values of chlorous acid and of peroxide of chlorine are likely

to require considerable correction, because I have not found that strict uni-

formity in the results I should have liked. This is owing in great part to the

difficulty of procuring a pure product, and the great tendency to secondary

decomposition. The mode of conducting the experiments may also have con-

siderable influence on the results. The above experiments wei'c made with

the relative proportions of the oxides of chlorine and of hydriodic acid that

would completely neutralize each other, so as to precipitate the iodine in the

Afree state.  sei'ies of experiments made in presence of excess of hydriodic

acid, the requisite correction being made for the solution of the iodine,

would be important, and these I intend to execute along with farther ob-

servations on this subject.

"AReport on the practicability of establishing  Close Time " for the

protection of indigenous Animals. By a Committee, consisting of

Prof. Newton, M.A., F.R.S., Eev. H. B. Tristram, F.R.S., J. E.

Harting, F.L.S., F.Z.S., Rev. H. Barnes, and H. E. Dresser

(Reporter).

YoTJE Committee has great pleasure in reporting that the object for which it

was appointed has continued to excite attention in the public prints during

--the past year, and that in the direction indicated by its last lieport the

piwtcction, namely, of those birds generally coming under the term " Wild
Fowl." There appears to be a widespread disposition among all classes to

extend in their favour the provisions of the ' Sea-Birds' Preservation Act,' in

--proof of which your Committee may cite two facts : 1, the establishment in

the county of Sussex (chiefly through the instrumentality of Mr. T. J. Monk,
of Lewes) of an Association whose members pledge themselves to abstain
from destroying Woodcocks in the breeding-season, which Association has
met with great encouragement from the principal landed proprietors in the
county ; and 2, the rapid growth of a well-founded belief that some steps are

absolutely necessary to stop the netting or shooting of Plovers during the
same season to ensure a continuance of the supply of theii- eggs, which
form, as is well known, a valuable commodity.

   Your Committee is fuUy aware of the danger of attempting to legislate on
this subject before the proper time; but from the assistance which has been

promised in various influential quarters, it entertains a sanguine hope that

some decided step may be taken next year; and belie-^-ing that the wai'mest
supporters of the principle of establishing a Close Time for indigenous

animals will readily listen to the recommendations of your Committee, it

respectfully prays that your Committee may be reappointed.

Repo7-t of the Committee on Earthquakes in Scotland. The Committee

   consists of Dr. Bryce, F.G.S., Sir W. Thomson, F.R.S., D. Milne-

   Home, F.R.S.E., P. Macfarlane, and J. Brough.

Veey little worthy of record has occurred during the past year. There

has been no earthquake or other disturbance in the Comrie district similar

--to those noticed in last Eeport. Prom other districts, however, slight shocks

of earthquake have been reported from Lochabcr in the end of November
and from the upper part of the Prith of Clyde in April. The latter occurred
during the night, was noticed by few, and doubt has been expressed by some
in regard to it. But as the same region was certainly agitated on more
than one occasion during the conduct of the previous inquiry instituted by
the Association, of which Dr. Buckland and Mr. Milne-Home had the
charge, there is no improbability in such an occurrence ; very little informa-
tion, however, that could be depended upon was obtained. In regard to
the other earthquake- shock there is less doubt. The district in which it
was felt comprises the Spean Valley and the lower lart of the Great Glen, a
region in which some of the most severe of our earthcjuakcs have been from
time to time experienced. In the present case, however, no change was
produced on the surface, or in the position of objects (see Eep. by Mr. D.

Milne-Home, Brit. Assoc. Hep. IS-iO) ; and without recording inBtrumonts
198 REPORT--1871.

it has beeu found impossible to state, with, any approach to certainty, whence

the undulations emanated, or to estimate the intensity of the shocks. It is

much to be desired that the additional duty of taking observations of this

kind should be undertaken at such stations of the Scottish Meteorological

Society as are situated in the districts where earthquakes have been so often

experienced. Such a measure, however, would necessitate the adoption of a

--seismometer of a much simpler construction than that at Comrie, belonging

to the Association one which should occupy a small space, and be little

liable to derangement, while capable of recording feeble shocks. Your Com-

mittee regrets that the hope expressed in last Eeport, in regard to the con-

structing of such an instrument, has not been reahzed ; but they confidently

hope that this important object will be accomplished in the course of the

coming year. By permission of the Association, communications might then

be opened with the Council of the Meteorological Society in regard to their

placing such a seismometer at a number of their stations within the areas liable

to disturbance, and establishing new stations with this express object where

such do not now exist. Such a combined system of observations would bring

the various areas ihto close relations with one another, and would possess

every advantage over an inquiry limited to a single locality.

YoTJK Committee have much pleasure in reporting that the fifth and last

Eeport of the Eoyal Commissioners to inquire into the condition of the

Exchequer, now Board of Trade, Standards has now been published, and

the general question of uniformity of weights and measures in this and other
countries has thus been placed before Her Majesty's Government in all its

bearings. Your Committee are much gratified at the large amount of infor-

mation the Commissioners have collected on the progress of the Metric System
in different countries, and only regret that they did not recommend a bolder
course than the 'permissive legislation of its use. The Commissioners, it
should be remembered, were not expressly instructed to inquire into the
Metric System; but one of the points referred to them being to inquire and
report whether amj and ^vhat additions to the existing ofiicial Standards of

Weights and Measures are now required, they understood that that involved

     cexprcssion of their opinion as to the establishment or continued prohi-
UNIFORMITY OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.  199

bition of the Metric System into this country, and they reported accordingly

on the subject.
   The Commissioners assumed that " there is no immediate cause requiring

a general change in the existing system of legal weights and measures of
the country for the i)urposes of internal trade," and regarded the question
of introducing the Metric System only in the aspect of facilitating inter-
national trade and scientific researches ; but your Committee are of opinion
that in so doing the Commissioners have not sufficiently taken into account
the bearings of the general question on education, on scientific workmanship,
and on the general economics of the nation. The Royal Commissioners have
recommended the legalization of the Metric System, and that, in order to

facilitate the use of the same. Metric Standards accurately verified, in relation
to the primary Metric Standards at Paris, should be deposited in the Standard

Department of the Board of Trade. But although your Committee consider
the carrying out of such recommendation a decided advance over the present
anomalous state of the law, past experience leads them to fear that no general
uniformity will ever be arrived at by mcvelj 2^ermissive legislation, and that
unless the use of Metric Weights and Measures is to become general at no
distant period, the reform will have no fair chance of success. As the late
Master of the Mint properly said, in the Standard Commission (Fifth Ecport,
p. xsx), "Although the general introduction of MetricWeights and Measures for
trade purposes might in the first instance be made permissive only, yet their
use should, to some extent, be made compuhory, else the mere permission to
use them in the home trade of this country woidd be practically a dead
letter." Your Committee have already reported on the decided advantages
of the Metric and Decimal system in economizing time and facilitating the
teaching of arithmetic in the schools, in effecting mechanical valuations,
and in Chemistry and Pharmacy. But neither of these advantages can be
realized to the full extent until the new system of Weights and Measures,
\nih. its divisors and multiples, become identified with our ideas of dimen-
sions and quantities. Your Committee admit that this must be the work
of time ; but all the more necessary is it to make provisions for the same,
by inserting in any measure on the subject clauses fixing a time when the
use of the new system will become binding. Your Committee therefore
greatly regret that the Bill introduced in the House of Commons by Mr.
J. B. Smith to establish the Metric System of Weights and Measures, and
fijting a time when the use of the same shall become compulsory, has not re-
ceived the cordial support it deserved. But a majority of five only against
the Second Eeading, in a small House, so late in the Session, must not be

accepted as conclusive evidence of the deliberate opinion of the Legislature

on the subject.
    Pending the final settlement of this important question, your Committee

are gratified in finding that, in consequence of representations made by them

to the Right Hon. Mr. W. E. Forster, Yice-President of the Committee of

Council on Education, the Educational Code of this year for the first time
prescribes " that in all schools the children in Standards Y. and YI. in Arith-

metic should know the principles of the Metric System, and be able to ex-
plain the advantages to be gained from uniformity in the method of forming
multiples and submultiples of the Unit." Your Committee are convinced

that the School is the proper lilace for^initiating this useful reform ; and in

view of the immense economy of time which would be gained in the teach-
ing of arithmetic, your Committee would urge that teachers should at once

commence introducing the subject in the Schools. To advance this desirable
300 KEPORT--1871.

 oliject, your Committee have had a Conference at the Lecture Theatre of the

 Kensington Museum in June last, when valaable testimony was given of the
. progress made in instructing children on the subject in the United States
 by Prof. Nathaniel Allen, and in Bombay by Mr. T. B. Kirkham, both

 gentlemen connected with the Education Departments of the respective
 countries. Your Committee have forwarded copies of the resolutions passed
 at the Conference, with copy of a little treatise on the Theory and Practice

 of the Metric System, to the Head Master of every Public and Endowed
 School, and they are preparing to do the same to all the principal Elemen-
 tary Schools in the Kingdom. It is much to be desired that all the works
 on arithmetic, and especially those which have acquired much reputation,

 should contain the necessary information on the Metric System, and j'our
 Committee are glad to report that this has already been done to a large ex-
 tent. Your Committee have also represented to tlie London School Board

 the desii-ableness of introducing the Metric System in the Schools established
 or supported by the Board, and they have been informed that the subject
 Avill shortly be considered by Prof. Huxley's Committee. Your Committee
 will correspond in a similar manner with the other School Boards, and they

%trust that these means they will seciire the general teaching of the system.

    Your Committee have forwarded a cop)' of the Mural Standard con-
 structed bj- Casella to the Industrial Museum in Edinburgh, and they have
 also sent one to Newcastle. Your Committee have not yet been able to

 obtain the set of Metric Standards which they ordered, and they are glad to
find from the following communication that the same will prove most useful

 for scientific researches :

  --Dear Sie, I have been for some time conducting a series of observa-

tions on the specific gravity of minerals and rocks. As the greatest possible

accuracy is indispensable, it is of course a matter of some importance that I

shoiild employ the weights which afford the most exact results. I find that

calculations of this nature can be done Avith far more accuracy, and in about
a quarter of the time, by using the Metric System ; but although I have

made numerous inquiries, I have hitherto failed in my endeavour to XH'ocure
a verified set of Metric Weights. May I venture to suggest that it would

very much tend to promote the object which the Committee of the British

Association have in \iew if they would procure one or two sets of verified

weights for the purpose to such Members as may require the use of such

standards for scientific investigation, and thus afford them the means of
comparing and verifying theii' own weights with the recognized standards of

the Association.

Frof. Leone Levi.  I remain, dear Sir, yours faithfully,

                                                 Toavnshexd M. Hall.

   Your Committee are convinced of the' great utility of the suggestion ; but

they will require a larger grant, since, as will be seen in the Fifth Eeport

of the Standard Commissioners, .£50 was paid by that Commission for a set
of Metric Standards made of brass by Deleuil, of" Paris.

   Your Committee regret that the war in France has suspended the opera-
tion of the International Standard Commission at Paris for the construction
and verification of primary international Metric Standards. That movement
arose from resolutions, expressing such a want, passed by the International
Gcodesical Conference held at Berlin in 1867, the Academy of Sciences of
TIDAL OBSERVATIONS.  201

St. Petersburg, and the Academy of Sciences in Paris ; and we trust that
by that means each country will possess a prototype copy of the Metre,
made in relation to the Metre of the Archives in Paris, all the copies being
made of the same material, compared by the same method and instru-
ments, at the same temperature, and preserved in the same manner. Her
Majesty's Government had deputed Prof. Airy, the lamented Prof. Miller,
and Mr. Chisholm, the Wardens of the Standards, to attend the Inter-
national Commission. Your Committee have reason to believe that it is of

the utmost importance to continue to give to this question unremitting at-
tention, and they are connnced that their action has been eminently useful
in guiding the Legislature, both of this country, of the Colonies, and even

of other countries, to the great question of uniformity of Weights and Mea-
sures aud Coins in the interest of Science. In pursuance of this object, j^our
Committee are anxious of diffusing as much information as possible. Especially
they are desirous of supplying those who conduct scientiiic researches with
the means of cariying them on in Metric Weights and Measures, as the most
universally known, the most exact, and the most economical as regards time

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

for which purpose they would be glad to purchase one or two sets of Metric

Standards. And for these, and other jxirposes, they suggest the reappoint-

ment of the Committee, with a grant of at least £75. The advantage of
introducing a universal system of Weights and Measures is well admitted.

Men of Science of all countries, to a large extent, use already a universal

vocabulary in this respect ; and your Committee trust that the British Empire
will ere long throw on the side of such a reform the immense weight of her

example and influence.

82. The work performed for the Tide Committee since the last Meeting

of the liritish Association has consisted chiefly in the evaluation of tide-

components in a similar manner to that described in the previous Eeports.
    S;3. Mr. Parkes having again placed the tracings of the curves of the

Kurrachee (Manora) self-registering tide-gauge at the disposal of the Com-

mittee, a second year's observations have been read off and completclj^ re-
duced. In addition to the tide-components evaluated for Liverpool and
llamsgatc, others (named for brevity J and Q) have been introduced to
correct the lunar diurnal (declinational) tides for parallax. These com-
ponents have been found to have sensible values for Kurrachee, where the
diurnal tides are comparatively l^rgc. The solar elliptic semidiurnal (E. and

T) components have also been included, now that two complete years' ob-
servations were available. The whole of the values of these tide-components
is contained in the previous Report (§ 07), the work having been completed
before the Report was printed. The correcting of the calculated heights

(§ 7U) for these additional components will doubtless bring them stUl nearer

                   ,

to the recorded high and low waters. It is contemplated correcting them
before the printing of the Report, and if this is done, the results will be con-

tained in it.

   84. The comparison between the calculated and recorded heights for Liver-
pool (§ 68) not being considered as good as might have been expected from
the labour bestowed on them, it was determined to continue the analysis of
the Liverpool Tides, with the view, if possible, of detecting the cause of the
largeness of some of the differences. Accordingly three years' observations
in continuation of the year 1806-67 were read off and completely analyzed.
The results are as foUow, and the results of the previous years are also

given for the sake of comparison :

85. It vaU. be seen, on comparing the results contained in the previous

lleport with the above, that the chief tides (the lunar and solar semidiurnal)

are now more retarded by about 4° than during the j-^ears previously analyzed.

The calculated heights in the comparison should therefore more nearly repre-

sent the heights about eight minutes after the hours assigned to them. An

Aexamination of the differences will show this to be the case.  fresh calcu-

lation and due aUowauce made for atmospheric pressure would doubtless very

considerably reduce the discrepancies.

   86. The gradual increase in the height of the mean level of the water (A,,),

probably arising from the filling in of the bed of the river and consequent

increase of friction, will account for some portion of this increased retarda-

tion. There was a very violent rise in the mean level for the year 1868-69,

amounting to four tenths of a foot ; it, however, in the following year had

again subsided to about its anticipated height. The uncertainty in the mean

level of the water is an element which must at times seriously affect the

differences between calciilated and recorded heights in any method of com-

putation of heights from ajixed datum. With respect to these changes now

taking place in Liverpool Bay, the following extract contains the substance

of the Marine Surveyor's report, dated October 2nd, 1S71, and confirms the

results determined by the i)receding reductions :

" The result of the survey of the channels of the river for the current year

shows that the changes rendered necessary in the arrangements of the light-

ing and buoyage are more important in their immediate effect on the course

of navigation than any which have occurred .for some years. The present

Queen Channel was opened in 1854, but was not buoyed for navigation pur-

poses until two years afterwards. Since that time the process of advance

from southward to northward of the Great Burbo Bank had been very

gradual for the first ten years, but more rapid recently, so that the advance

had extended to about half a mile. At the same time the North Channel

had widened in the same proportion, and there was no appreciable narrowing

of the channel in that direction. On the north side, however, during the

last four years, the changes had been more rapid, and the buoys had been

altered twice within that period. It was now necessary that the Bell Beacon

should be removed northward one third of a mile, and also that the Formby

light-ship should be removed one third of a mile westward. Thus the Bell

Beacon buoy would be brought into a direct line with the Crosby light-ship.

The bar was in a satisfactory state, and the whole of the channels were in

as safe a condition as they had been for many years, being deeper as well as

more straight and not narrower than formerly."

87. It is very much to be regretted that the authorities at Liverpool

have chosen the George's landing-stage for a tide-float, affected as it must

be (sometimes to a considerable extent) by the ever-varying weight it has to

bear. This will affect the whole of the tide-components evaluated, but more

especially the solar components, and will account for the different values of

the solar semidiurnal tide, which, judging from the corresponding lunar

component, should agree within much narrower limits. It is therefore

thought that, should it be determined to again discuss the Liverpool tides,

it will be better to take the tide-curves as self-registered at Helbre Island

at the mouth of the Dee, in preference to those of George's Pier. The Helbre

Island tide-curves it is considered will give much superior results.

88. Through the kindness of the United States' Coast Survey Office, two

years' tide observations, taken at Fort Point, San Francisco Bay, California,

being a continuation of the observations already analyzed (§ 66), have been
TIDAL OBSERVATIONS.  205

received. The results of the analysis of these observations (those contained
in § 66 being also included for the sake of comparison) are as follow :

91. It is extremely interesting to find that, althougli the lunar and

solar semidiurnal tides are very small in value, the series of means from

which they were obtained were extremely regular and good, and the conse-

quent determination of the phase of spriag-tides from their respective epochs

is pi'obably correct within a few minutes. The proportion between the am-

plitudes of the lunar and solar semidiurnal tides is the nearest to equality

j'et obtained, being in the ratio of 11 to 6. The comparatively large value

of Rj of Series S is undoubtedly a genuine tide, but the smallness of the cor-

Mresponding value of Scries must forbid the conclusion of its beiug purely

astronomical. It is perhaps produced by temperature or wind, its time of

maximum being about 40 minutes after noon. There are also indications of
a similar and large annual tide of 0-3 foot amplitude, and maximum about

July, which is also pi'obably meteorological in its origin. The proportion

between the lunar and solar diurnal (Declinational) tides (E, of Series

and P) will be, on the assumption of the variation of E^ of Series being as

the square of the sine of the declination, about 4 to 1.

obtained since the Edinburgh Meeting :                                                                                              '

MISCELLANEOrS COMMUNICATIONS TO THE SECTIONS.

                      MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS.

Address by Professor P. G. Tait, M.A., F.E.S.E., President of the Section.

In opening the proceedings of this Section my immediate predecessors have ex-

ercised their ingenuity in presenting its widely diifering component subjects from

their several points of view, and in endeavouring to coordinate them. What
they were obliged to leave unfinished, it would be absurd in me to attempt to com-

plete. It would be impossible, also, in the limits of a brief address to give a de-
tailed account of the recent progress of physical and mathematical knowledge.
Such a work can only be produced by separate instalments, each written by a spe-
cialist, such as the admiraole " Heports which form from time to time the most

valuable portions of our annual volume.

  I shall therefore confine my remarks in the main to those two subjects, one in

the mathematical, the other in the purely physical division of our work, which are

comparatively familiar to myself I wish, if possible, to induce, ere it be too late,

native mathematicians to pay much more attention than they have yet paid to

Hamilton's magnificent Calculus of Quaternions, and to call the particular notice

of physicists to our President's grand Principle of Dissipation of Energy. I think

that these are, at this moment, the most important because the most promising

parts of our field.

If nothing more could be said for Quaternions than that they enable us to exhibit

in a singulai'ly compact and elegant form, whose meaning is obvious at a glance

on accoimt of the utter inartificiality of the method, results which in the ordinary

Cartesian coordinates are of the utmost complexity, a very powerful argument for

their use would be furnished. But it would be unjust to Quaternions to be con-

tent with such a statement ; for we are fuUy entitled to say that in all cases, even

in those to which the Cartesian methods seem specially adapted, they give as sim-

ple an expression as  any other  method                                  while  in the great majority of cases they
                                                                      ;

give a vastly simpler one. In the common methods a judicious choice of coor-

dinates is often of immense importance in simplifying an investigation ; in Qua-

ternions there is usually «o choice, for (except when they degrade to mere scalars)

they are in general utterly independent of any particular directions in space, and

select of themselves the most natural reference lines for each particvdar problem.

This is easily illustrated by the most elementary instances, such as the following :

The general equation of Cones involves merely the direction of the vector of a point,

while that of Surfaces of Revolution is a relation between the lengths of that vector

and of its resolved part parallel to the axis ; and Quaternions enable us by a mere

1871.                                                                           1

mark to separate the ideas of length and direction without introducing the cumbrous

and clumsy square roots of sums of squares -which are otherwise necessary.

   But, as it seems to me that mathematical methods should be specially valued in

this Section as regards their fitness for physical applications, -what can possibly

from that point of vieyv be more important than Hamilton's v? Physical ana-
logies have often been invoked to make intelligible va,rious mathematical processes.
Witness the case of Statical Electricity, -wherein Thomson has, by the analogy of

Heat-conduction, explained the meaning of various important theorems due to

Green, Gauss, and others ; and wherein Clerk-Maxwell has employed the proper-
ties of an imaginary incompressible liquid (devoid of inertia) to illustrate not
merely these theorems, but even Thomson's Electrical Images. [In fact he has

gone much further, having applied his analogy to the puzzHug combinations pre-

sented by Electrodynamics.] There can be little doubt that these comparisons
o-we their birth to the smaU intelligibility, per se, of -what has been called La-

a distance, in the steady flow of heat in a conductor, and in the steady motion of in-

compressible fluids. But when we are taught to imderstand the operator itself we are

able to dispense -with these analogies, which, however valuable and beautiful,

have certainly to be used with extreme caution, as tending very often to confuse

and mislead. Now Laplace's operator is merely the negative of the square of Hamil-

ton's V, which is perfectly intelligible in itself and in all its combinations ; and
can be defined as gi-ring the vector-rate of most rapid increase of any scalar func-

--tion to which it is applied giving, for instance, the vector-force from a potential,

the heat-flux from a distribution of temperature, &c. Very simple functions of

the same operator give the rate of increase of a quantity in any assigned direction,
the condensation and elementary rotation produced by given displacements of the

parts of a system, &c. For instance, a very elementary application of v to the theory

of attraction enables us to put one of its fundamental principles in the foUo-wing

--extremely suggestive form : If the displacement or velocity of each particle of a

medium represent in magnitude and direction the electric force at that particle,

the con-esponding statical distribution of electricity is proportional evei-ywhere to
the condensation thus produced. Again, Green's celebrated theorem is at once
seen to be merely the well-kno\\-n equation of continuity expressed for a hetero-

geneous fluid, whose density at every point is propoi-tional to one electric potential,
and its displacement or velocity proportional to and in the direction of the electric
force due to another potential. But this is not the time to pm-sue such an inquiry,

for it would lead me at once to discussions as to the possible nature of electric

phenomena and of gravitation. I believe myself to be fully justified in saying
that, were the theoi-y of this operator thoroughly developed and generally known, the

whole mathematical treatment of such physical questions as those just mentioned

would undergo an immediate and enormous simplification ; and this, in its turn,

would be at once followed by a proportionately large extension of our knowledge*.

   * The following extracts from letters of Sir W. E. Hamilton have a perfectly general

--application, so that I do not hesitate to publish them: " De Morgan was the yery first

" person to notice the Quaternions in print ; namely in a Paper on Triple Algebra, in the

--" Camb. Pliil. Trans, of 1844. It was. I think, about that time, or not very long after-

" wards, that he wrote to me, nearly as follows : I' suspect, Hamilton, that you have
" caught the right sow hy the ear ! ' JBetween us, dear Mr. Tait, I think that we shall begin

" the SHEADING of it ! ! " " You might without offence to me, consider that I abused the
" license of hope, which may be indulged to an inventor, if I were to confe.ss that I expect

"the Quaternions to supply, hereafter, not sneTelj mathematical methods, \>nt also phy-

" sical suggestions. And, in particular, you are quite welcome to smile if I say that it

" does not seem extravagant to me to suppose that a fiiU possession of those a priori prin-
" cipfes of mine, about the nviltiplication of vectors (including the Law of the Four Scales

" than hinted to the public, jiigut have led (I do not at all mean that in mi/ hands they
" ever woidd have done .so) to an Anticipation of the great discovery of Oersted."

   " It appears to me that one, and not the least, of the services which quaternions may be

TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  ^

   And this is but one of the claims of Quaternions to the attention of physicists.
When we come to the important questions of stress and strain in an elastic solid,
we find again that all the elaborate and puzzling machinery of coordinates com-

monly employed can be at once comprehended and kept out of sight in a mere

--single symbol a linear and vector function, which is self-conjugate if the strain

be pure. This is simply, it appears to me, a proof either that the elaborate machinery
ought never to have been introduced, or that its use was an indication of a com-
paratively savage state of mathematical civilization. In the motion of a rigid solid
about a fixed point, a quaternion, represented hy a single symbol which is a func-
tion of the time, gives us the operator which could bring the body by a single
rotation from its initial position to its position at any assigned instant. In short,

whenever with our usual means a result can be obtained in, or after much labour

reduced to, a simple form. Quaternions -ndll give it at once in that fomi ; so

that nothing is ever lost in point of simplicity. On the other hand, in numberless

cases the Quaternion result is immeasurably simpler and more intelligible than

any which can be obtained or even expressed by the usual methods. And it is not
to be supposed that the modern Higher Algebra, which has done so much to sim-

plify and extend the ordinary Cartesian methods, would be ignored by the general

employment of Quaternions ; on the contrary. Determinants, Invariants, &c.
present themselves in almost everj' Quaternion solution, and in forms which
have received the full benefit of that simplification which Quaternions generally
produce. Comparing a Quaternion investigation, no matter in what department,
with the equivalent Cartesian one, even when the latter has availed itself to the
utmost of the improvements suggested by Higher Algebra, one can hardly help
making the remark that they contrast even more stronglj^ than the decimal
notation with the binary scale or with the old Greek Arithmetic, or than the

well-ordered subdivisions of the metrical system with the preposterous no-systems
of Great Britain, a mere fragment of which (in the form of Tables of Weights and

Measures) forms perhaps the most effective, if not the most ingenious, of the many

instruments of torture employed in our elementary teaching.
   It is true that, in the eyes of the pure mathematician, Quaternions have one

grand and fatal defect. They cannot be applied to space of n dimensions, they are
contented to deal with those poor three dimensions in which mere mortals are
doomed to dwell, but which cannot bound the limitless aspirations of a Cayley or a
Sylvester. From the physical point of view this, instead of a defect, is to be re-

garded as the greatest possible recommendation. It shows, in fact, Quaternions
to be a special instrument so constructed for application to the Actual as to have

thrown overboard everything which is not absolutely necessary, without the
slightest consideration whether or no it was thereby being rendered useless for

applications to the Ineonceivahle.

   The late Sir John Herschel was one of the first to perceive the value of Qua-
ternions ; and there may be present some who remember him, at a British Asso-
ciation Meeting not long after their invention, characterizing them as a " Cornu-
copia from which, turn it how you will, something valuable is sure to fall." Is it not

strange, to use no harsher word, that such a harvest has hitherto been left almost

entirely to Hamilton himself? If but half a dozen tolerably good mathematicians,
such as exist in scores in this country, were seriously to work at it, instead of

spending (or rather wasting) their time, as so many who have the requisite leisure
now do, in going over again what has been already done, or in working out mere

details where a grand theory has been sketched, a very great immediate advance
would be certain. From the majority of the papers in our few mathematical
journals one would almost be led to fancy that IBritish mathematicians have too

much pride to use a simple method while an unnecessarily complex one can be

had. No more telling example of this could be wished for than the insane delusion

under which they permit Euclid to be employed in our elementary teaching. They

seem voluntarily to weight alike themselves and their pupils for the race ; and a

cynic might, perhaps without much injustice, say they do so that they may have mere

self-imposed and avoidable difficulties to face instead of the new, real, and dreaded

ones (belonging to regions hitherto unpenetrated) with which Quaternions would too
soon enable them to come into contact. But this game will certainly end in disaster.

As surely as Mathematics came to a relative stand-still in this country for nearly a
century after Newton, so surely will it do so again if we leave our eager and

watchful rivals abroad to take the initiative in developing the grand method of

Hamilton. And it is not alone French and Germans whom we have now to

dread, Russia, America, regenerated Italy, and other nations are all fairly entered

for the contest.

The flights of the imagination which occur to the pure mathematician are in general

so much better described in his formulae than in words, that it is not remarkable to

find the subject treated by outsiders as something essentially cold and uninteresting,

while even the most abstruse branches of physics, as yet totally incapable of

being popularized, attract the attention of the uninitiated. The reason may

perhaps be sought in the fact that, while perhaps the only successful attempt to

--invest mathematical reasoning with a halo of glory that made in this Section by
--Prof. Sylvester is known to a comparative few, several of the highest problems

of physics are connected with those simple observations which are possible to the

many. The smell of lightning has been observed for thousands of years, it required

the sagacity of Schonbein to trace it to the formation of Ozone. Not to speak of

the (probably fabulous) apple of Newton, what enormous consequences did he

obtain by passing light through a mere wedge of glass, and by simply laying a lens

on a flat plate ! The patching of a trumpery model led Watt to his magnificent
inventions. As children at the sea-shore plajing with a "roaring buckie," or in
later life lazily puffing out rings of tobacco-smoke, we are illustrating two of the
splendid researches of Helmholtz. And our President, by the bold, because simple,

use of reaction instead of action, has eclipsed even his former services to the Sub-

marine TelegTaph, and given it powers which but a few years ago woidd have been

deemed unattainable.

In experimental Physics our case is not hopeless, perhaps not as yet even alarm-

ing. Still something of the same kind may be said in this as in pure Mathematics.

If Thomson's Theory of Dissipation, for instance, be not speedily developed in this

country, we shall soon learn its consequences from abroad. The grand test of our

science, the proof of its being a reality and not a mere inventing of new terms and

squabbling as to what they shall mean, is that it is ever advancing. There is no

standing still ; there is no running round and round as in a beaten donkey-track,

coming back at the end of a century or so into the old positions, and fighting the

self-same battles under slightly different banners, which is merely another fonn of

Astagnation (Kinetic Stability' in fact). " little folding of the hands to sleep,"

in chuckling satisfaction at what has been achieved of late years by our great

experimenters, and we shall be left hopelessly behind. The sad fate of Newton's

successors ought ever to be a warning to us. Trusting to what he had done, they

allowed mathematical science almost to die out in this country, at least as com-

pared with its immense progress in Germany and France. It required the united

exertions of the late Sir J. Herschel and many others to render possible in these

islands a Boole and a Hamilton. If the successors of Davy and Faraday pause to

ponder even on their achievements, we shall soon be again in the same state of

WhoIgnominious inferiority.  will then step in to save us ?

Even as it is, though we have among us many names quite as justly great as any

that our rivals can produce, we have also (even in our educated classes) such an

immense amount of ignorance and consequent credulity, that it seems matter for

surprise that true science is able to exist. Spiritualists, Circle-squarers, Perpetual-

motionists, Believers that the earth is flat and that the moon has no rotation,
swarm about us. They certainly multiply much faster than do genuine men of

science. This is characteristic of all inferior races, but it is consolatory to re-

member that in spite of it these soon become extinct. Your quack has his little

day, and disappears except to the antiquary. But in science nothing of value can
ever be lost ; it is certain to become a stepping-stone on the way to further truth.
Still, when our stepping-stones are laid, we should not wait till others employ

them. *' Gentlemen of the Guard be kind enough to fire first " is a courtesy

entirely out of date ; with the weapons of the present day it woidd be simply

suicide.

There is another point which should not be omitted in an address like this. For

obvious reasons I must speak of the general question only, not venturing on ex-

amples, though I coidd give many telling ones. Even among our greatest men of

science in this country there is comparatively little knowledge of what has been

already achieved, except of course in the one or more special departments culti-

vated by each individual. There can be little doubt that one cause at least of this

is to be sought in the extremely meagre interest which our statesmen, as a rule,

take in scientific progress. While abroad we find half a dozen professore teaching

parts of the same subject in one University (each having therefore reasonable leisure),

with u.s one man has to do the whole, and to endeavour as he best can to make some-

thing out of his very few spare moments. Along with this, and in great part due

to it, there is often found a proneness to believe that what seems evident to the

thinker cannot but have been long known to others. Thus the credit of many

valuable discoveries is lost to Britain because her pliilosophers, having no time to

spare, do not know that they are discoveries. The scientific men of other nations

are, as a rule, better informed [certainly far better encouraged and less over-worked],

and perhaps likewise are not so much given to self-depreciation. Until something

resembling the 'Fortschritte der Physik,' but in an improved form, and published

at smaller intervals and with much less delay, is established in this country, there

Whyis little hope of improvement in this respect.      should science be imperfectly

summarized in little haphazard scraps here and there, when mere property has its

elaborate series of Money-articles and exact Broker's Share-lists ? Such a work

would be very easy of accomplishment : we have only to begin boldly ; we do

not need to go back, for in every year good work is being done at almost every part

--of the boundary between, as it were, the cultivated land and the still unpenetrated

forest enough at all events to show with all necessary accuracy whereaoouts that

boundary Ues.

There is no need of entering here on the question of Conservation of Energy

it is thoroughly accepted by scientific men, and has revolutionized the greater part

of Physics. The facts as to its history also are generally agreed upon, but differ-

ences of a formidable kind exist as to the deductions to be drawn from them.

These are matters, however, which will be more easily disposed of thirty years

hence than now. The Transformation of Energy is also generally accepted, and,

in fact, under various unsatisfactoiy names was almost popularly known before the

Conservation of Energy was known in its entirety to more than a very few. But
the Dissipation of Energy is by no means well known, and many of the results of

its legitimate application have been received with doubt, sometimes even with

attempted ridicule. Yet it appears to be at the present moment by far the most

promising and fertile portion ot Natural Philosophy, having obvious applications

of which as yet only a small percentage appear to have been made. Some, indeed,

were made before the enunciation of the Principle, and have since been recognized
as instances of it. Of such we have good examples in Fourier's great work on

Heat-conduction, in the optical theorem that an image can never be brighter than

mthe object, in Gauss's mode of investigating electrical distribution, and some of

Thomson's theorems as to the energy of an electromagnetic field. But its dis-

coverer has, so far as I know, as yet confined himself in its explicit application to

questions of Heat-conduction and Restoration of Energy, Geological Time, the

Earth's Rotation, and such like. Unfortunately his long-expected Rede Lecture
has not yet been pubHshed, and its contents (save to those who were fortunate

enough to hear it) are still almost entirely unknown.

But there can be little question that the Principle contains implicitly the whole

theory of Thenno-electricity, of Chemical Combination, of Allotropy, of Fluo-

rescence, &c., and perhaps even of matters of a higher order than common physics

and chemistry. In Astronomy it leads us to the grand question of the age, or
6 REPORT 1871.

perhaps more correctly the phase of life, of a star or nebula, sliows us the material

of potential suns, other suns in the process of formation, in vigorous youth, and in

every stage of slowly protracted decay. It leads us to look on each planet and

satellite as having been at one time a tiny sun, a member of some binary or multiple

group, and even now (when almost deprived, at least at its surface, of its original

enert^y) presenting an endless variety of subjects for the application of its methods.

It leads us forward in thought to the far-distant time when the materials of the

present steUar system shall have lost all but their mutual potential energy, but
shall in virtue of it form the materials of future larger suns with their attendant

planets. Finally, as it alone is able to lead us, by sure steps of deductive reasoning,

--to the necessary" future of the universe necessary, that is, if physical laws for ever

--remain unchanged so it enables us distinctly to say that the present order of

things has not been evolved through infinite past time by the agency of laws now
at work, but must have had a distinctive beginning, a state beyond which we are

totally unable to penetrate, a state, in fact, which must have been produced by

other than the now acting causes.

Thus also, it is possible that in Physiology it may, ere long, lead to results of a

different and much higher order of novelty and interest than those yet obtained,

immensely valuable though they certainly are.

It was a grand step in science which showed that just as the consumption of

fuel is necessary to the working of a steam-engine, or to the steady hght of a

candle, so the living engine requires food to supply its expenditure in the forma

of muscular work and animal heat. Still grander was Rumford's early anticipation
that the animal is a more economic engine than any lifeless one we can construct.

Even in the explanation of this there is involved a question of very great interest,

still unsolved, though Joule and many other philosophers of the highest order

have worked at it. Joule has given a suggestion of great value, viz. that the

animal resembles an electromagnetic- rather than a heat-engine ; but this throws

us back again upon om- difficulties as to the nature of electricity. StiU, even sup-

posing this question fully answered, there remains another--perhaps the highest

which the human intellect is capable of directly attacking, for it is simply pre-

posterous to suppose that we shall ever be able to understand scientifically the

--source of Consciousness and Volition, not to speak of loftier things there remains

Nowthe question of Life.  it may be startling to some of you, especially if you

have not particularly considered the matter, to hear it surmised that possibly we

may, by the help of physical principles, especially that of the Dissipation of Energy,

--some time attam to a notion of what constitutes Life mere Vitality I repeat,
Knothing higher.
                  you think for a moment of the vitality of a plant or a zoophj-te,

the remark perhaps will not appear so strange after all. But do not fancy that the

Dissipation of Energy to which I refer is at all that of a watch or such-like piece

of mere human mechanism, dissipating the low and common form of energy of a

single coiled spring. It must be such that evei-y little part of the living organism

has its own store of energy constantly being dissipated, and as constantly replenished

from external sources drawn upon by the whole arrangement in their harmonious

working together. As an illustration of my meaning, though an extremely inade-

quate one, suppose Vaucanson's Duck to have been made up of excessively small

parts, each microscopically constructed as perfectly as was the comparatively coarse

whole, we should have had something barely distinguishable, save by want of

instincts, fi'om the living model. But let no one imagine that, should we ever pene-

trate this mystery, we shall thereby be enabled to produce, except from life, even the

lowest form of life. Our President's splendid suggestion of Vortex-atoms, if it be

correct, vdM enable us thoroughly to understand matter, and mathematically to in-

vestigate all its properties. Yet its very basis implies the absolute necessity of an

--intervention of Creative Power to form or to destroy one atom even of dead

matter. The question really stands thus : Is Life physical or no ? For if

it be in any sense, however slight or restricted, physical, it is to that extent

a subject for the Natural Philosopher, and for him alone. It would be en-

tirely out of place for me to discuss such a question as this now and here

I have introduced it merely that I may say a word or two about what has been

so often and so persistently croaked against the British Association, viz. that it

tends to develope what are called Scientific Heresies. No doubt such charges are

Abroug-ht more usually against other Sections than against this ; but Section haa

not been held blameless. It seems to me that the proper answer to aU such charges

will be very simply and easily given, if we merely show that in our reasonings

from observation and experiment we invariably confine our physical conclusions
strictly to matter and energy (things which we can weigh and measure) in their

multiform combinations. Excepting that which is obviously purely mathematical,

whatever is certainly neither matter nor energy, nor dependent upon these, is not a

subject to be discussed here, even by implication. All our reasonings in Physics must,

so far as we know, be based upon the assumption, founded on experience, that in

the universe, whatever be the epoch or the locality, under exactly similar circum-

stances exactly similar results will be obtained. If this be not granted there is an

end of Physical Science, or, rather, there never could have been such a Science *.

To use the word " Heresy" with reference to purely phj^sical reasonings about

Geological Time, or matters of that kind, is nowadays a piece of foUy which even

Galileo's judges, were they alive, would shrink from, as calculated to damage none

but themselves and the cause which of old they, according to their lights, very

natui-ally maintained.

There must alwaj's be wide limits of uncertainty (unless we choose to look upon.

Physics as a necessarily finite Science) concerning the exact boundary between the

Attainable and the Unattainable. One herd of ignorant people, with the sole

prestiffe of rapidly increasing numbers, and with the adhesion of a few fanatical

deserters from the ranks of Science, refuse to admit that all the phenomena even

of ordinaiy dead matter are strictly and exclusively in the domain of physical

science. On the other hand, there is a numerous group, not in the slightest degree

entitled to rank as Physicists (though in general they assume the proud title of

Philosophers), who assert that not merely Life, but even Volition and Con-

sciousness are mere physical manifestations. These opposite errors, into neither

of which is it possible for a genuine scientific man to fall, so long at least
as he retains his reason, are easily seen to be very closely allied. They are both

to be attributed to that Credulity which is characteristic alike of Ignorance and

of Incapacity. Unfortunately there is no cure ; the case is hopeless, for great
ignorance almost necessarily presumes incapacity, whether it show itself in the com-

paratively harmless folly of the Spiritualist or in the pernicious nonsense of the

Materialist.

 --Alike condemned and contemned, we leave them to their proper fate oblivion

but still we have to face the question, where to draw the line between that which

is physical and that which is utterly beyond physics. And, again, our answer is

Experience alone can teU us ; for experience is our only possible guide. If we at-
tend earnestly and honestly to its teachings, we shall never go far astray. Man has

been left to the resources of his intellect for the discovery not merely of physical

laws, but of how far he is capable of comprehending them. And oiu* answer to

tion of any thing which we can discover for ourselves, by studying the ordinary

course of natiu'e, would be an absurdity.

  A profoimd lesson may be learned from one of the earliest little papers of

President, published while he was an undergraduate at Cambridge, where he shows

that Fourier's magnificent treatment of the Conduction of Heat leads to formulai

for its distribution which are intelligible (and of course capable of being fiUly

verified by experiment) for all time future, but which, except in particular cases,

when extended to time past, remain intelligible for a finite period only, and then

    * It might be possible, and, if so, perhaps interesting, to speculate on the results of
secular changes in physical laws, or in particles of matter which are subject to them, but
(so far aa experience, which is our only guide, has taught us since the beginning of modern
science) there seems no trace of such. Even if there were, as these changes must be of

necessity extremely slow (because not yet even suspected), we may reasonably expect, ft-om

the analogy of the history of such a question as gravitation, especially in the discovery of
Neptune, that our work, far from becoming impossible, will merely become considerably

more difficult as well as more laborious, but, on that account, all the more creditable when

successfully carried out.

indicate a state of things wliich could not have resulted under known laws from

any conceivable previous distribution. So far as heat is concerned, modem inves-

tigations have shown that a previous disti-ibution of the matter involved may, by

its potential energy, be capable of producing such a state of things at the moment
of its aggregation ; but the example is now adduced not for its bearing on heat

alone, but as a simple illustration of the fact that aU portions of our Science, and

especially that beautiful one the Dissipation of Energy, point unanimously to a

beginning, to a state of things incapable of being derived by present laws from any

conceivable previous arrangement.

I conclude by quoting some noble words used by Stokes in his Address at Exeter,

words which should be stereotyped for every Meeting of this Association :

" When from the phenomena of life we pass on to those of mind, we enter a region

" still more profoimdly mysterious        Science can be expected to do but little

" to aid us here, since the instrument of research is itself the object of investigation.

Exhibition and Description of a Model of a Conoidal Cubic Surface called the

"Cylindroid," ivhich is presented in the Theory of the Geometrical Freedom of

a Rigid Body. By Robeki Stawell Ball, A.M., Professor of Applied

Mathematics and Mechanism, Royal College of Scietice for Ireland.

We become acquainted with the geometrical freedom which a rigid body enjoys

by ascertaining the character of all the displacements which the natui-e of the re-

straints will permit the body to accept.

If a displacement be infinitely small, it is produced by screwing the body along

a certain screw.

If a displacement have finite magnitude, it is produced by an infinite series of

infinitely small screw displacements.

For the analysis of geometrical freedom, we shall only consider infinitely small

screw displacements. This includes the initial stages of aU displacements.

   To analyze the geometrical restraints of a rigid body we proceed as foUows :

Take any line in space. Conceive this line to be the axis about which screws are

--successively formed of everj' pitch from oo to +qo . (The pitch of a screw is the

Wedistance its nut advances when turned through the angular imit.)        endeavour

successively to displace the body about each of these screws, and record the particular

screw or screws, if any, about which the restraints have permitted the body to re-
ceive a displacement. The same process is to be repeated for every other line in

space. If it be found that the restraints have not permitted the body to receive

any one of these displacements, then the body is rigidly fixed in space.

   If, after all the screws have been tried, the body be found capable of displace-
ment about one screw only, the body possesses the lowest degree of freedom.

   If one screw (A) be discovered, and, the trials being continued, a second screw

(B) be found, the remaining tiials may be abridged by considering the information

which the discovery of two screws aflbrds. It is in connexion with the two screws

that the cyUndroid is presented.

   The body may receive any displacement about one or both of the two screws

A and B.

   The composition of these displacements gives a resultant which could have been
produced by displacement about a single screw.

   The locus of this single screw is the conoidal cubic sm-face which has been called

the "cylindroid " (at the suggestion of Professor Cayley).

   The equation of the cylindroid is

                  s(.r2+y2)-2azi/=0.

   Any line (s) upon this surface is considered to be a screw, of which the pitch is

                                                    c+acos2^,

 where c is any constant, and 6 is the angle between s and the axis of x.
    The fundamental property of the cylindroid is thus stated. If any three screws

of the surface be taken, and if a body be displaced by being screwed" along each of
these screws through a small angle proportional to the sine of the angle between
the remaining screws, the body after the last displacement will occupy the same

position that it did before the first.
    For the complete determination of the cylindroid and the pitch of all its screws,

we must have the quantities a and c. These quantities, as well as the position of
the cylindroid in space, are completely determined when two screws of the system

are known.

    In the model of the cylindroid which was exhibited, the parameter a is 2'6 inches.
The wires which correspond in the model with the generating lines of the surface
represent the axes of the screws. The distribution of pitch upon the generating

lines is shown by colouring a length of 2-6 x sin 26 inches upon each wire. The di-

stinction between positive and negative pitches is indicated by colouring the former
red and the latter black.

    It is remarkable that the addition of any constant to all the pitches attributed in
the model to the screws does not affect the fundamental property of the cylindroid.

   When a rigid body is found capable of being displaced about a pair of screws, it

is necessarily capable of being displaced about every screw on the cylindroid deter-
mined by that pair.

   The theorem of the cylindroid includes, as particular cases, the well-known rules
for the composition of two displacements parallel to given lines, or of two small ro-

tations about intersecting axes.

   If the parameter a be zero, the cylindroid reduces to a plane, and the pitches of
all the screws become equal. If the arbitrary constant which expresses the pitch

be infinite, we have the theorem for displacements, and if the pitch be zero, we

have the theorem for rotations.

   As far as the composition of two displacements is concerned, the plane can only
be regarded as a degraded form of the cylindi'oid from which the most essential

features have disappeared.

                                      0*1 the Number of C'ovariants of a Binary Quantic.

                                              By Professor Catlet, D.C.L., F.E.S.

   The author remarked that it had been shown by Prof. Gordan that the number
of the covariants of a binary quantic of any order was finite, and, in particular,
that the numbers for the quintic and the sextic were 23 and 26 respectively. But
the demonstration is a very complicated one, and it can scarcely be doubted that a
more simple demonstration will be found. The question in its most simple form is
as follows : viz. instead of the covariants we substitute their leading coefficients,
each of which is a " seminvariant " satisfying a certain partial differential equa-

tion                        say, the  quantic  is  («, S,  e. . . -kj^x, y)",  then  the  differential  equation                                                                                                                                                                                                                               is

On Lamberfs Proof of the Irrationality of tt, and on the Irrationality/ of cer-
         tain other Quantities. By J. W. L. Glaisher, B.A., F.R.A.S.

   The arithmetical quadrature of the circle, that is to say, the expression of the
ratio of the circumference to the diameter in the foi-m of a vulgar fraction with
both numerator and denominator finite quantities, was shown to be impossible by
Lambert in the ' Berlin Memoirs ' for 1761 ; and the proof has since been given in

an abrido'ed and modified form by Legendre in the Notes to his ' Elements de Geo-
metric.' Although Legendre's method is quite as rigorous as that on which it is

founded, still, on the whole, the demonstration of Lambert seems to afford a more

striking  and  convincing  proof of the truth     of  the  proposition                                              his  investigation,
                                                                                                                 ;

however, is given in such detail, and so many properties of continued fractions, now

well known, are proved, that it is not very easy to follow his reasoning, which ex-
tends over more than thirty pages. The object of the present paper is to exhibit

Lambert's demonstration of this important theorem concisely, and in a form free

from unnecessary details, and to apply his method to deduce some results with
regard to the irrationality of certain circular and other functions.

   The theorem which Lambert proves, and from which he deduces the irrationality

of TT, is that the tangent of a rational arc (i. e. an arc commetisurahle with the raditts)
must he irrational; and this he demonstrates by means of an expression for the

tangent as a continued fraction, viz.
                                 = --X

   Legendre proves a theorem which is easily seen to follow directly from Lambert's
mode of investigation, viz. that if in the continued fraction

then, whether /3j, /3^ · . . be all positive or all negative, or some positive and some

negative, the value of the continued fraction is in-ational. He also remarks that

=--w^ must be irrational ; for if it  , we should have, from (i), since tan 7r=0,

That Lambert's proof is perfectly rigorous and places the ftict of the irra-

tionality of TT beyond all doubt, is evident to every one who examines it carefully

and considering the small attention that had been paid to continued fractions pre-

viously to the time at which it was written, it cannot but be regarded as a very

admirable work.

 On the Calculation of e {the base of the Napierian Logarithms) from a

The series by which e is defined, viz.

better formula could be found for its calculation. Taking the series in the form

and from the manner in which the continued fraction is deduced from the series, it
is clear that the ?«th convergent of the former con-esponds to n terms of the latter.
There is, however, a far more convergent fraction from which e can be computed,

forming on  ^- an operation similar to that affording the greatest common

Legendre in the Notes to his ' Geometric ;' and this is reproduced in the Notes to

easily obtained from the differential equation

The thirtv-nintli convergent to the continued fraction (3) gives a result as accu-

rate as that found by siunniing the first ninety terms of the series (1) ; but there
would be no great disparity between the absolute nimiber of figures formed in the

two calculations. The computation of the convergents was, however, far preferable

in point of aiTangement and convenience to the calcidation of the successive terms

of a series ; for not only were the divisions in the latter replaced by multiplications,

which are far more compact, but the work in the former case ran straight forward

and reqim-ed no copjdug of results. There is also another very gi-eat advantage in

the continued fraction : the great difficulty of performing a piece of work to a consi-

derable number of decimal places is the inconvenience caused by the length of the

numbers ; and in the above calcidation we get roughly 2/« figures of the residt
without ever having to use a nmuber more than n figures long in the work : thus
p.,,, and q^g contain each 67 figm-es, and by dividing them we obtain 138 figm"es

of the residt ; this advantage is due to the fact that all the numerators in (3),

except the first, are equal to unity. It may be remarked that the final division

was the most laborious part of the work ; the calculation of p^^ and ^33 required

barely 13,000 figm-es, the division about 18,000.

        On certain Families of Surfaces. By C. W. Meerifield, F.R.8.

   The author had already shown that conical and cylindrical surfaces not only

satisfy the general equation of developable sm-faces in ditierentials of the seconii
order,

                                                                    rt=s^,

but also that on passing to the diiferential equation of the third order, there are
two equal roots in the case of conical surfaces and three equal roots in the case of

cylindi'ical surfaces.

  An examination of the surfaces described by the motion of a plane parabola of

any order with its diameters parallel to a fixed right line showed that the con-

dition of a pair of equal roots in the equation of the third order,

considered as an equation inX, was satisfied by all surfaces traced out by a plane
parabola moving parallel to a fixed line and enveloping any ciu-ve in space what-
ever. As singular cases, he noticed the spindle made by causing a parabola (whether
fixed or of variable size) to rotate roimd any diameter, the ruled surface with a

director plane, and developable surfaces.

   He also showed that when three of the roots were equal, the surface necessarily

reduced to a plane or a cylinder.
   These results are, however, restricted by the method of generating the surface.

In fact, for the case of three equal roots, when the partial difl'erentials of the third
order are in continued proportion, Mr. Cayley has shown that the resulting equations
can be integrated and that the integration gives a more general result.

                              Note by Mr. Cayley,

                      Ort Douhhj Diamitral Quartan Curves.

By F. W. Newmax, Emeritus Professor of University College, London.

   This paper aimed to detail the /o/-»i of the curves, and point out the simplest modes
of investigating their peculiarities. It distributed the general equation into three
groups of five, five, and four families, and was accompanied by seventy-six diagrams.

   If we call

                                 A.r'+2D.ry-|-B2/'-l-2E.r=+2Fy=-|-C=0

A Bthe general equation, the first group of five families is when or or both vanish,

Dthe second group when For or both vanish, and these together nearly include

all the forms. For in the third group, from which either no term of the original

equation vanishes, or only C, three of the families are at once reducible to the se-

cond group by putting either y--\-f-=y'^, else x'-\-e^=x''; then the proposed curve
of {xy) is visibly at most a mere variety of the preceding, being either of the .same

species with, or'of a lower species than, that of (.ry'J or of {x'y). In the case of
F=--B=/3', D=S2,
                /'^, this reduction is impossible ; but then by operating on x
E=--instead of y, it becomes possible unless also A.=a!^,
                                                                e'^; that is, the method

Dfails only when A, B, Fare of one sign, and E, of the opposite. The analysis,

thus limited, readily yields the same result, that the forms have nothing new.

  A cross division of "the species is into Limited and Unlimited loci. All are Cen-

-- Atric, the origin being the Centre. Finite forms are Monads, Duads, and Tetrads.
   Monads are : 1. symmetrical oval (say, a Shield), as from

nV =2. An Oval with undulating sides {Viol or Dumb-bell), as      (>«''-- .r^)(.T2-|-w'^),

A =m'^.^n^. 3. Lemniscate or Double Loop, as a'^y'^ [m---x'^)x '^. i. A. Scutcheon,

obliquely at the centre, as

when «i^> n^. 9. Litersectiny Ovals : the same equation as in 8, only with m"^ <w^.

AU curves are here deemed Monads which can be drawn without taking the pencil

of:' the paper.

 --Duads are : 1. Twin Ovals (not singly symmetrical on opposite sides), as

                             = -- --a'^y^             w^
                                     (in^  a;^) (a;^        ).

2. Tivin Beans (or Hearts, Dicuamos). 3. Pair of Sandals (Disandalon): this has

always two double tangents parallel, yet the disposition of the four points of con-
D^Utact is not the same in all cases. (They form a rectangle when
                                                                   ; they are in

lines diverging from the centre when F=0.) 4. Pair of unsjTnmetrical Lemniscates,

which I call Pour Kites.

Tetrads can only consist of unsymmetrical Ovals, symmetricallj- disposed.

Of the infinite curves, one very limited class may be called Parabolic, those in

                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

vertices imite), Pointed Gohlets or Knotted Parabolic Hour-glass; S, Parabolic

Hour-glass ; 4, Perforated Hom'-glass (with disk in centre) ; 5, Hollow-bottomed

Goblet.

  When A=0, we may have asymptotes parallel to the axis of x, and when B=:0,
to the axis of y. Such ciu-ves must be treated apart. When a Quartan Hyperbola is

confined between parallel asymptotes, I call it an Arch, Roimd-headed or Hollow-

headed, as the case may be ; they are foimd, of coiu'se, in pairs. A Quartan Hy-

ferbola which is confined within diverging asj-mptotes like the Conic Hyperbola,

call a Basin ; when it crosses or otherwise envelopes its diverging asymptotes, I call

it a Cup. Cups and basins may be Eoimd-bottomed or HoUow-bottomed. Again, a

Quartan Hyperbola may lie between an oblique and a vertical asymptote ; I _then

call the Hyperbola itself Oblique, equally when it lies between two asymptotes of

dilferent systems. Such an Hyperbola may cut one, and only one, asymptote ; then I

call it Paratomous : if it cut both, it is an Oblique Cup. Cups may be Pointed at

bottom and unite                                                                                   they may  be  also in Contact  at  bottom, or they may intersect.
                                                                                                ;

Vertical and horizontal asymptotes develope other and simpler foi-ms. Conchoids,

S'ouped in pairs, generate one class, and Arches another. Arches may intersect,
  asins also may intersect sideways ; I call this Paratomy. Such are the elements

(adding only Studs or Conjugate Points) of which aU the loci are composed.

Four Hyperbolas, of whatever class, are the utmost that can arise as locus of a

Quartan equation ; whether in square, each in one quadi-ant, or as Cross Arches,

or as Oblique, or Oblique and Paratomous, or as ai-oimd and crossing the axes, or

between unsymmetrical asymptotes, or it may be Cups instead of Basins.

In the midst of these infinite cui-ves, some one of the Monad or Twin Ovals

AB=D-are often found as Satellites. It must be added that when                                                                                                                            and the

locus is infinite, we find Oblique Parallel Asymptotes, and even, related to them,

Oblique Paratomous Arches.

Such is the general description oi\hQ forms. The investigation is simple.

We know that a straight line can cut a Quartan at most in four pomts. This

often shows what forms are impossible.

Put    V= DBFA D E                                                                                 , then by Conies we know that if V=0, our general equa-

          EF C

tion will degenerate into the product of two quadratic factors. Besides, if A, B, C
are positive and E, F negative, and E-=AC, F^=BC, the equation degenerates

into two ellipses.

  If F^=BC, and B, F have opposite signs, the curve crosses itself (in a Knot)
where .r^O and By--|-F=:0 ; but if B, F have the same sign, the Knots become
Studs. Thus if E-=AC, and F-=BC, but E, F have opposite signs, there are two

Knots on one axis and two Studs on the other.

We find where the cm've crosses its axis, by putting Aa'*4-2E.i'--|-C=0 when

«/^=0, and Bif+2Yif+C=0 when .r^=0.                                                                              ACThen if                        Eis positive, must be ne-

ACgative, if there be any vertex in OX. If                                                                       is negative, there are two vertices.

                                                                                                   Put T=Aari-|-2D.ry+B«/S

An undulation of the curve implies a double tangent. Such double tangents

are always parallel to one axis. [I desire a general proof.] There can be only

two pairs parallel to one axis. To ascertain whether there is undulation across

OY, put x^=Q, and try whether y- is there a 7naximum or a tnitiimtan.

with an easy test to secure ourselves against the omission of any of them. Such

a test is furnished by the following theorem :--

The identity employed in the text is only a particular case of Euler's identity,

which is tantamount to affirming that the number of partitions of n into r distinct
integers is the same as the number of partitions of w into any integers none greater
than r, in which all the integers from 1 to r appear once at least. It has not, I be-
lieve, been noticed that these two systems of partitions are conjugate to each other,
each partition of the one system having a correspondent to it in the other. The
mode of passing from any partition to its correspondent is by converting each of its
integers into a horizontal line of units, laying these horizontal lines vertically under
each other, and then summing the columns. Thus, ex. gr., 3, 4, 5 will be first ex-
panded horizontally into

                        1111 111, ,

                      11111,

and then summed vertically into

This is the method employed by Mr. Ferrers to show that the number of partitions
pf n into r, or a less number of parts, is the same as the number of partitions of n
into parts none greater than r, and is, in fact, only a generalization of the method

of intuitive proof of the fact that

the difference merely being that we here deal with a parallelogram separated into

--two contenuinous parts by an irregularly stepped boundary one tilled with units, the

other left blank, instead of dealing with one entirely filled up with units.

 On the General Camnical Form of a Spherical Harmonic of the nth Order.
              By Sir W. Thomson, LL.I)., D.C.L., F.R.SS. L. Sf E.

   LetHj- (x, y, z), H'^ {x, y, z) . . . ., or for brevity H, H', &c., denote 2«+l inde-

pendent spherical harmonics of degree i, that is to say, homogeneous functions each

fulfilling the Laplace's equation

                            dx''*"d^^~d^~^                            ^^

The formula

                            AH+A'H', &c.,                             (2)

where A, A' are constants, is a general expression for the harmonic of degree i

but it is not a "canonical" expression. Borrowing this designation from Mr,

CHfford's previous paper, we may define as canonical constituents for the general

spherical harmonic of degree i, any set of particular distinct harmonics fulfilling

the following conditions :

             JJhH'^o-=0, JjH'H"f;a-=0, &c                             (3)

where J \ da denotes integration over any spherical surface having the origin of co-

ordinates for centre. Supposing now that H, H' . . . actually fulfil these condi-

tions, let it be required to find, if possible, another canonical form (|^, |^', . . .).

   Try

                                    f^=AH+A'H'+&c.,

                            f^'=BH+B'H'+&c.

Then, (3) being taken into account, ^^^'^' dcr=0 gives

notably singular in this respect, that for any one of its constituents the nodal cone

consists of circular cones having a common axis and planes through this axis.

The nodal cone of anj- spherical harmonic of degree i is an algebraic surface of

+degree 2t l, and I proposed the question, can canonical forms not be found in

which the nodal cone of each constituent is not resolvable into circular cones and
planes ? This question is answered by the present commimication.

   [A diagram was roughly sketched on the Doard, to illustrate the nodal cone of a
harmonic difl'ering infinitely little from a tessaral harmonic ; which, with 2i others
differing infinitely little from the other 2i--3 tessaral, the two sectorial, and the
zonal, constituting the polar canonic, would constitute a generalized canonic]

Account of Experiments upon the Resistance of Air to the Motion of Vortex-

   rings. By EoBEET Sta^vell Ball, A.M., Professor of Applied Mathe-

   matics and Mechanism, Hoycd College of Science for Ireland.

The experiments, of which the following is an abstract, were canied out with
Athe aid of a grant from the Royal Irish Academy.
                                                   paper containing the results

has been laid before the Academy.

   The author proposed to bring this subject before the Association in order to elicit
discussion. He would greatly value am- suggestions as to the direction in which

future experimental researches would be likely to prove fruitful. Such suggestions,
though acceptable from all som-ces, would come with peculiar usefulness from

those who are conversant with the profound hydi-odj-namical problems of vortex

motion.

  A brief accoimt of one series of the experiments, and a Table embodying them,

will be given.

   Air-rings, 9 inches in diameter, were projected from a cubical box, each edge of
which is 2 feet. The use of this box was suggested by Professor Tait (see a

Author, Phil. Mag. July 1868). The blo'svs were delivered by means of a pendulum

called the striker, which, falling from a constant height, ensiu-ed that the rings
were projected with a constant velocity. In the experiments described in the
present series, this velocity was somewhat over 10 feet per second. The pendulum

was released to deliver the blow from a pair of forceps, each jaw of which was in

connexion with a pole of a battery. After the ring had traversed a range varied
from 2 inches to 20 feet, it impinged upon a target. The blows upon the target

Anclosed the circuit, which had been opened at the release of the striker.

electric chronoscope (devised, it is oelieved, by Wheatstone) measured the

interval of time between the release of the striker and the impact upon the

target.

The target was placed successively at distances of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20

feet from the orifice of the box. Not less than ten observations of the time were taken

at each range. The probable error of the mean time at each range is in every

Acase less than 1 per cent, of the whole amount.                                                              special series of experiments,

which need not be described, determined the value of the chronoscope readings in

seconds.

   The observations are next represented in a cui-ve, of which the abscissae are the

ranges, and the ordinates the corresponding mean chronoscope readings. By

drawing tangents to this curve, the velocity of the ring at its different points ia

approximately foimd.

  A second projection is made in which the abscissEe are the ranges and the or-

dinates are the velocities ; the points thus determined are approximately in a straight

line.

It follows that the rings are retarded as if acted upon by a force proportional

to the velocity, and an approximate value of the numerical coefficient becomes

known.

  A more accm-ate value having been determined by the method of least squares,

the results are embodied in the following Table (p. 28), of which a description

is first given. The Roman letters refer to the several columns of the Table.

   I. contains a series of numbers for convenience of reference.

   II. It was found that the motion of the ring in the immediate vicinity of the
box was influenced by some disturbing element. The zero of range was therefore
taken at a point 4 feet distant from the orifice. This column contains the ranges.

   III. The interval between the release of the striker and the anival of the ring
at a point 4 feet from the orifice is 6-5 chronoscopic units, or about 0-9.3 second.
This constant must be subtracted from the mean readings of the time, in order
to reduce the zero epoch to the instant when the ring is 4 feet from the orifice.
This column contains the mean readings of the chronoscope corrected by this

amount.

IV. When the ranges are taken as abscissae, and the corresponding times as

ordinates, it is found that a cui'\e can be drawn through or near all the points

thus produced. To identify the points with the cun-e, small corrections are in some

cases required. These con-ections are shown in column IV. In the case of experi-

ment 5 the  con-ection  amounts to 07                                                                         this is about 0-09 second.  The magnitude

of this error appears to show that some derangement, owing possibly to a current

of air or other som-ce of irregularity, has vitiated this result. For the sake of
imiformity, however, the corrected value has been retained.

determined by the points.

                        . 0-1288 second,

with a probable error of 0-0002 second. By means of this factor the coiTected

means in column V. are evaluated in seconds in column VI.

    On Units of Force and Energy. By Professor J. D. Everett, F.B.S.E.

   The object of the paper was to urge the necessity of giving names to absolute
units of force and energy, that is, units not varying with locality, like the gravita-
tion units vulgarly employed (pound, foot-pound, &c.), but defined by reference to
specifi.ed units of length, mass, and time, according to the condition that unit
force acting on unit mass produces unit acceleration.

   The author proposed that the iinits of force and of energy (or of work), thus
related to the metre, gramme, and second, be called respectively the dyne and the
pone {biivafiLs, ttovos), and that the names kilodyne, megadyne, kilopone, viegapo^ie be
employed to denote a thousand and a million dynes and pones. The megadyne
and megapone will thus be the units of force and energy related to the metre, the
tonne, and the second.

   He also proposed that the units of force and energy related to the foot, the

poxmd, and the second be called respectively the kinit and the erg *,

               On the Corrosion of Copper Plates hy Nitrate of Silver.
             By J. H. Gladstone, F.B.S., and Alfred Tribe, F.C.S.

   In some recent experiments in chemical dynamics, the authors had occasion to
study the action of nitrate of silver on copper plates in various positions. They
observed that when the plate was vertical there was rather more corrosion at the
bottom than at the top. This is easily accounted for by the upward current, which
flows along the surface of the deposited crystals, and which necessitates a movement
of the nitrate-of-silver solution towards the copper plate especially impinging on
the lower part. It was also found that when the copper plate was varnished on
one side it produced rather more than half the previous decomposition, and was
most corroded at the edges of the varnish. Bj' making patterns with the varnish,
this edge action became very evident. This was explained by the fact that the
long crystals of silver growing out from the copper at the borders can spread their
branches into the open space at the side, and so draw their supply from a larger
mass of solution than the crystals in the middle can do and increased crystalliza-

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

tion of silver means increased solution of copper. This was proved by making the
varnish a perpendicular wall instead of a thin layer, when the greater corrosion was
not obtained. In a plate completely surrounded with liquid, the greatest growth of
crystals is also evidently from the angles. It was likewise observed that if a vertical
plate be immersed, the lower part in nitrate of copper, and the upper part in nitrate of
silver, there is greater corrosion about the point of jimction. This was attributed

to the greater conduction of the stronger liquid.

On Democritus and Lucretius, a Question of Priority in the Kinetical Theory
               of Matter. ByT. M. Lindsay and W. R. Smith.

Physicists who have recently called attention to the anticipation of modern

doctrines as to the ultimate natiu-e of matter by the ancient atomists, have looked

too exclusively to Epicurus and his expositor Lucretius, to the neglect of Demo-

critus and Leu3ippus. Democritus had no such expositor as Lucretius, but his

main views are accessible in the fragments collected by Mullach, and in the well-

known references of Aristotle, Simplicius, and Laertius. With the help of these

sources, the paper sketches the main features of the earliest atomic theories. The

following are leading points :

Democritus and Leucippus trace the variety of phenomena to three primitive

diflurences in tlie ultimate elements of nature, viz. differences (1) in Figure, o-;;^^/xa,
A N AN NAas between
and  ; 2( ) in Order, tci^is, as    ,  ; (3) iu Position, ^eVty, as
NZ, [Arist. Met. A. 4]. From the motion in vacuo of atoms with these primary

differences, the whole variety of nature is deduced, generation and corruption being

merely syncretiou and division (a-vyKfua-is, Sidxpio-tj) [Ar. De Gen. et Cor. i. 8,

i. 2, Phys. viii. 9]. All atoms have the same density and the same opfifj ttjs (j>opas

(specific gravity ?) [Ar. Dj Ccelo, i. 7, Theophrastus De Sensu, 71]. Hence all
tend to fall in one downward direction * but being ignorant of the law of inertia,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

Democritus supposes that the larger atoms fall faster, impinge on lighter particles,
and produce a vortex motion (SiVr;). In this vortex similars come together and

cohere, lighter particles go to the surface, and at length worlds (Kotr/not) are gene-

rated [Diog. Laertius, ix. 31J. Epicurus differs from Democritus mainly by main-
taining that all atoms have equal and invariable downward velocities, and come

into collision only by fortuitous automatic deflection from the line of fall. The first

half of this theory /oaks like the first law of motion, but is really as far from being

in harmony with the laws of acceleration and other known truths as the earlier view.
As physicists, therefore, Epicurus and Lucretius made no advance on Democritus,

while by mixing up with legitimate physical speculation the incongruent mdcqihynical

notion of chance (not the mathematical notion of chance, which plays a part in the
modern kinetic theory of gases), they produced that hybrid of physics and meta-

physics, a materialistic philosophy. It was by adopting the Epicurean doctrine

of chance that Gassendi, the first of modern atomists, became also the father of
modern materialism.

Speculations on the Continuity of the Fluid State of Matter, and on Relations

   between the Gaseous, the Liquid, and the Solid States. By Prof. James

   Thomson, LL.D.

Through the recent discovery of Dr. Andrews on the relations between dif-

ferent states of fluid matter, a difiiculty in the application of om- old ordinary

language has arisen. He has shown the existence of continuity between what is

ordinarily called the liquid state and what is ordinarily called" the gaseous state

of matter. _He has shown that the ordinary gaseous and ordinary liquid states

are only widely separated forms of the same condition of matter, and may be
made to pass into one another by a course of continuous physical changes pre-

senting nowhere any interruption or breach of continuity. If, now, there be

no distinction between the liquid and gaseous states, is there any meaning stiU

to be attributed to those two old names, or ought they to he abandoned, and

the single name the fluid state to be substituted for them both ? The answer
must be that in speaking of the whole continuous state we have now to call

it simply the fluid state; but that there ai-e two regions or parts of it, meet-

ing one another sharply in one way, and merging gradually into one another in a

Wedifterent way, to which the names liqtiid and (/as are still to be applied.  can

have a substance existing in two fluid states diflerent in density and other proper-

ties, while the temperature and pressure are the same in both : and we may then

find that an introduction or abstraction of heat without change of temperature or

of pressure will effect the change from the one state to the other, and that the

* Cf. the argument in Zeller, Phil, der Griechenj i. 913, ff.

change either waj^ is perfectly reversible. When we thus haye two different states

present together in contact with one another, we have a perfectly obvious distinc-
tion, and we can properly continue to call one of them a liquid state and the other

a gaseous state of the same matter. The same two names may also reasonably be

applied to regions or parts of the fluid state extending away on both sides of the

Hshai-p ar definite boundary, wherever the merging of the one into the other is little
or not at all apparent.  we denote geometrically aU possible points of tempera-

ture and pressure jointly, by points spread continuously in a plane surface, each

point in the plane being referred to two axes of rectangular coordinates, so that

one of its ordinates shall represent the pressure and the other the temperature de-

noted by that point, and if we mark all the successive boiling- or condensino--

points of pressure and temperature as a continuous line on this plane, this lin^e,

which may be called the boilimf-line, will be a separating boundary between the

regions of the plane coiTespoudiug to the ordinary liquid state and those corre-

sponding to the ordinary gaseous state. But by consideration of Dr. Andrews's

experimental results (Phil. Trans. 1869), we may see that this separating boun-

dary comes to an end at a point of temperature and pressure which, in conformity

with his language, may be called the critical point of pressure and temperature
jointly; and we may see that from any ordinary liquid state to any ordinary
gaseous state the transition may be gradually efiected by an infinite variety of

courses passing round the extreme end of the boiling-line.

   Fig. 1 is a_ diagram to illustrate these considerations and some allied consider-
ations to which they lead in reference to transitions between the three states, the

 and temperature where solidification sets in. Tliis point T is to be noticed as a

 remarkable point of pressure and temperature, as being the point at which alone

  the substance, pure from admixture with other substances, can exist in three states,
  solid, liquid, and gaseous, together in contact with one another. In making this

  statement, however, the author wishes to submit it subject to some reserve in re-

 spect to conditions not as yet known with perfect certainty. He observes that we

  might not be quite safe in assuming that the melting-point of ice solidified from
  the gaseous state is the same as the melting-point of ice frozen from the liquid
 state, and in making other suppositions, such as that the same quantity of heat
 woidd become latent in the melting of equal quantities of ice formed in these two

 ways. Such considerations as these into which we are forced if we attempt to

 sketch out the course of the boiling-line, and to examine along with it the corre-

 sponding boundary-lines between liquid and solid and between gas and solid, may

  be useful in suggesting questions for experimental and theoretical investigation

 which may have been generally overlooked before. Proceeding, however, upon

 assumptions such as usuallj' are tacitly made, of identity in the thermal and dyna-
 mic conditions of pure ice solidified in ditlerent ways, the author points out that

 we must suppose the three curves (namely, the line between gas and liquid, the

 line between liquid and solid, and the line between gas and solid) to meet in

 one point, shown at T in the figm-e. This point of pressure and temperature for
 any substance may then be called the triple point for that substance. In the figure

Mthe line T represents the line between liquid and solid. It is drawn showing in an

 exaggerated degree the lowering of the freezing temperature of water by pressure, the
 exaggeration being necessary in order to allow small changes of temperature to be per-

Nceptible in the diagram. The line T represents the line between the gaseous and

the solid states of water substance. The two cui-ves T L and T N, one between gas

 and liquid and the other between gas and solid, have been constructed for water sub-
 stance through a great range of temperatures and pressures by Regnault, from his ex-
 periments on the pressure of saturated aqueous gas at various temperatures above and

below 0° Centigrade*. He has represented and discussed his results above and below

the temperatm-e at which the water freezes (which in strictness is not 0° C, but is the
freezing temperature of water in contact with no atmosphere except its own gas),
as if one continuous curve could extend for both. As brought out experimentally,
 indeed, they present so little appearance of any discontinuity that the distinctness
 of the two cm'ves from one another might readil}^ escape notice in the considera-
tion of the experimental results. Prof. Thomson points out, however, that the
range from temperatm-es below to temperatures above freezing comprises what
ought to be regarded as two essentially distinct curves meeting one another in the

point T ; and he fm-ther suggests that continuations of these curves, sketched in
as dotted lines T P and T Q, may have some theoretical or practical significance not
yet fully discovered. He thinks it likely that out of the three curves at least the

Mone, T, between liquid and solid may have a practically attainable extension past T,

as shown by the dotted continuation T R. Various known experiments seem to
render this supposition tenable, whether the condition supposed may have been
actually realized in experiments hitherto or not. He thinks, too, that there is much
reason to suppose that the curve L T between gas and liquid has a practically
attainable extension past T, as shown by the dotted continuation T P.

   In reference to the continuity of the liquid and gaseous states. Prof Thomson
showed a model in which Dr. Andrews's curves for carbonic acid are combined in
a curved surface, obtained from them, which is referred to three axes of rectangular
coordinates, and is formed so that the three coordinates of each point in the curved
surface shall represent, for any given mass of carbonic acid, a pressure, a tempe-
rature, and a volume, which can coexist in that mass. This curved surface shows

in a clear light the abrupt change or breach of continuity at boiling or condensing,
and the gradual transition round the extreme end of the boiling-line. Using this
model and a diagram of cui-ves represented here in fig. 2, the author explained a
view which had occurred to him, according to which it appears probable that
although there be a practical breach of continuity in crossing the line of boiling-

points from liquid to gas, or from gas to liquid, there may exist, in the nature of

                          * Memoires de TAcademie des Sciences, 1847, pi. viii.

thing's, a theoretical continuity across this breach, having some real and true sig-

mnificance. The general character of this view may readily be seen by a glance at

fig. 2, -which Dr. Andrews's curves are shown by continuous lines (not dotted),

and cun-ed reflex junctions are shown by dotted lines connecting those of Dr. An-

drewss curves which are abruptly interrupted at their boiling- or condensing-points
of pressure. It is to be understood that each curve relates to one constant tempe-
rature, and that pressures are represented by the horizontal ordinates, and coitc-
spondrng volumes, of one mass of carbonic acid constant throughout aU the curves
are represented by the vertical ordinates. The author points out that, by experi-

ments of Donny, Dufotu", and others*, we have already proof that a continuation
of the curve for the liquid state past the boiling stage for some distance, as shown

dotted in fig. 2, from a to some point 6 towards/, would correspond to states already

attained. He thinks we need not despair of practically realizing the physical con-

ditions corresponding to some extension of the gaseous curve such as from c to «f

/in the figure. The overhanging part of the curve from e to he thinks may re-

present a state in which there woidd be some kind of unstable equilibrium ; and

so, although the curve there appears to have some important theoretical significance,
yet the states represented by its various points would be tmattainable through oh.
any ordinary mass of the fluid. It seems to represent conditions of coexistent tem-
perature, pressure, and volume, in which, if all parts of a mass of fluid were placed,
it would be in equilibrium, but out of which it would be led to rush, partly into
the rarer state of gas, and partly into the denser state of liquid, by the slightest

inequality of temperature or of density in any part relatively to other parts.

Observations on Water in Frost Rising against Gravity rather than Freezing

      in the Pores of Moist Earth. By Professor James Thomson, LL.D.

   In this paper Prof. Thomson, in continuation of a subject which he had brought
before the British A.ssociation at the Cambridge Meeting in 1862*, on the Disinte-
gration of Stones exposed to Atmospheric Influences, adduced some remarkable
instances which he had since carefully observed. In one of these, observed by
him in February 186-4, he showed that water from a pond in a garden had in time
of fi'ost raised itself to heights of from four to six inches above the water sm-face-
level of the pond by permeating the earth-bank, formed of decomposed gi-anite,
which it kept thoroughly wet, and out of the upper sm-face of which it was made
to ascend by the fi'ost, so as to freeze as columns of transparent ice, rather than
that it would freeze in the earth-pores. The columns were arranged in several
tiers one tier below another, the lower ones having been later formed than those
above them, and having pushed the older ones up. From day to day during the
fi'ost the earth remained unfrozen, while a thick slab of columnar ice, made up of
successive tiers of columns, formed itself by water coming up from the pond and
insinuating itself forcibly under the bases of the ice-columns so as to freeze there,
pushing them up, not by hydraulic pressure, but on principles which, while seem-
ing not to have been noticed previously to their having been suggested by the
author at the Cambridge Meeting, appear to involve considerations of scientific in-
terest, and to afibrd scope for further experimental and theoretical researches. In
the case referred to, the remarkable phenomenon showed itself very clearly, of
water passing from a region of less than atmospheric pressure in the wet pores of
the earth, into a place in the base of the columns where it was subject to more
than atmospheric pressure, and subject also to stresses unequal in different direc-
tions, fi-om its being loaded with the mass of ice and also with some gravel or
 earthy substances above it ; and this action went on rather than that the water
 woidd freeze in the pores of the moist earthy bottom on which the columns stood,
 and which was above the water surface-level of the pond.

     The method proposed in this paper for ascertaining the distances of the stars
  applies only to binary sj'stems, which are not too faint or too close to be well ob-
 served. It has this peculiarity, that it can be applied to remote stars with as much

  accuracy as to nearer ones, always supposing that such remote stai's axe still bright

enough to allow of accurate observation ; whereas the method of determining the
distance of a star by its parallax becomes more difficult as the distance of the star
increases, notwithstanding any brightness which it may have.

   The method now proposed is founded on that of spectral analysis. I suppose a
certain ray, which I will call X, to be chosen as the standard ray, and to be care-

fully observed at various times in each of the stars of a binary system during an

interval of some years. The orbit described by the stars around their common

centre of gravity must not lie in a plane perpendicular to the visual ray joining

those stars aud the earth, nor must it approach that position too nearly, otherwise

the true result would be masked by the errors of observation. The simplest case

is that of two stars, equal in mass and brightness, and revolving in circles about
their common centre of gi-avity. Supposing such a system of two stars to exist,
the most favourable case is when the plane of their motion passes through the

earth. If it does so, the stars will appear to move in straight lines. Supposing
them to be, when fii-st observed, at their greatest elongation, they will approach

each other with an increasing apparent velocity, varying as the sine of the time (or

circular arc described) until they come into apparent conjunction, when one star

will be hidden by the other for a certain time, after which they will recede from

each other in like manner as they had approached. But the observer would not

be able to say with certainty which of the two stars was nearest to him, since the
same phenomena would be presented if the distances of the two stars were inter-

changed, and at the same time the direction of their motions reversed. Now

suppose the method to be applied which I have proposed. At the time of their

conjunction, or near it, neither star would be approaching the earth, consequently

Xthe observed deviation of the ray (if any) from its normal position would be due

to the 2)ro2)er motion of the system of the two stars relatively to the earth, which is

Nowa constant quantity to be allowed for in all other observations.  suppose another

set of observations to be made at the time of the greatest elongation of the two
stars. At that time each of the stars is apparently stationary, but in fact one

of them is approaching and the other receding from the earth with a maximum

Xvelocity. The observed deviation of the ray will therefore be different in the

spectra of the two stars, and (allowance having been made for the proper motion of

the system) it wiU appear at once which of the two stars is approaching the earth,
and the question of its direct or retrograde orbit will be resolved. At the same time
the distance of the two stars from the earth will result from the calculation. It

will be well, perhaps, to take a hypothetical example, which will show how this

element results from observation.

I suppose, then, that observation has shown :
(1) The period of one complete revolution of the binaiy star round its centre of

gravity to hejiftt/ years.

   (2) The greatest elongation of the stars to be ten seconds.

  X(3) And at the time of this gi-eatest elongation the deviation of the ray to be

such as to prove that one of the stars is then approaching the earth at the rate of

ten miles per second, and the other star receding from the earth at the same rate.

And this will evidently be their true velocity in their orbit.

  Now 50 years = 1,577,880,000 seconds, and therefore since each star moves in

its orbit at the rate of ten miles per second, it describes in the course of one whole

revolution of 50 years a circle of 15,778,800,000 miles in circumference. The

radius of this circle is the distance of the star from the common centre of gi-avity,
and therefore the diameter of the circle is the distance of the two stars from each

other (which in the hypothetical example I have selected is constant). This

diameter will be found to be about equal to 54 radii of the earth's orbit. Now,
when the stars were at their greatest elongation, observation showed their angular

distance to be teji seconds. Consequently we have only to calculate at what distance
from the earth a length of 54 radii woidd subtend an angle of 10", and we find
that this would occur at a distance of 1,113,500 radii. Such, then, is the distance

of the binary star from the earth, namely, 1,113,500 times the distance which sepa-

rates the earth from the sun.

   So_ simple a case as the hypothetical one which I have here calculated is, indeed,
not likely to occur in practice ; most cases would require a gi-eater complexity of

                                                                     3*

calculation, but the principles involTed -would he the same. When the distances

and positions of the two components of a binary star have been carefully observed by

astronomers for a certain number of years,ithas been found possible in manyinstances

to determine the elements of their orbit, its ellipticity, the inclination of its plane

to the ecliptic, the time of one complete revolution, the apparent maximum elonga-

tion, &c. &c. But the distance of the double star from the earth has hitherto re-

mained unknown, because that is dependent upon the real size of the orbit, and

observation (without the spectroscope) gives only the ajiparent size of it. Knowing
the elements of the orbit we can, indeed, calculate the velocity of either of the

stars in the direction of the earth at any moment, relativeli/ to that which it has at

any other moment. But the determination of the absolute velocity requires the

Nowdistance of the stars from the earth to be known.  a few observations (if per-

Xfectly correct) of the deviation of the ray supply this wanting element, viz. the

actual velocity at the time of observation, and likewise enable us, as I have already

explained, to eliminate the proper motion of the double star. This might be some-

times difficult, but geometrical considerations, quite in hannony with those now

employed by astronomers to determine the other elements of the binary system,

would undoubtedly effect this also.

   In what I have written above, I have supposed great precision in the observa-

--tions- greater, no doubt, than would be practicable with the optical means no2v

in use ; but this makes no difference in the theory of the subject, which for a
certain time may be allowed to pass ahead of its practical realization. It will

doubtless be remembered that the method of determining the sun's distance by means

of a transit of Venus was proposed by James Gregory in his ' Optica Promota,'

and by Halley in his ' Catalogus Stellarum Australium,' nearly 100 j'ears before an

opportunity offered of testing it by an actual observation.

         Precession and Nutation. By Professor Chaeles V. Zenger.

   In the case of a rapidly revolving solid body two different cases may occur, the

mass of the solid body being quite uniformly distributed around the axis of rota-
tion, or, on the contrary, the uniformity being destroyed by the accumidation of
matter on one side of the axis.

    In the fii'st instance the centrifugal force will act symmetrically on opposite
sides of the solid body in rotation, and be in equilibrium. It then gives rise to
the phenomenon of a free axis ; that is to say, the axis of rotation steadily holds

its position dm-iug the rotation, because the particles of the body will also have
the tendency to retain their position while the motion is going on with sufficient

speed.

   These facts may best be shown by Fessel's apparatus, called the gyroscope, in

which a cu'cular disk is put in rapid rotation romid an axis freely movable in every

direction.

   If there is a force acting only on one side, for instance a weight pressing on the
axis, or an impulse given to it, the axis will show a lateral motion, and describes
a cone, or at its extremity a circle.

   But if there is on the disk itself an imequal distribution of the mass, which is
produced by fastening a small circular disk or sheet of paper with an excentric hole
upon the axis, the motion becomes more complicated ; and if the velocity be con-

sidered uniform for the short time required for the axis to describe a cirde, there
will be an additional lateral motion produced by the adhering paper sheet dis-
turbing the motion, and a small ellipse will be described by the end of the axis
revolving upon the circle, as is shown in the diagi'am traced on blackened paper by
the top of such an apparatus.

   The greater the mass of the disturbing paper sheet, and the more the speed of
the motion diminishes, the larger becomes the diameter of the ellipse described by
the top, and the more disturbed are its revolutions on the periphery of the circle,
both axis of the ellipses becoming much larger. Diminution of the speed origi-
nates, instead of the circular motion of the top, a spiral motion, and the effect is
            '

                        TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                            37

that the velocity of the disk's motion decreasing, the top no longer describes a
circle, but a continuous spiral line, on which the small ellipse revolves.

   These motions, however complicated they may be, may be gi-aphicaliy shown by

holding a blackened paper to the top of the axis of the apparatus, and causing it

to approach steadily, when the axis becomes more inclined by the diminution of

the velocity.

To do this more easil;^ and with more precision, near the rotating disk is placed

a_ support, with a brass frame for holding a sheet of blackened paper, exactly at a

right angle to the support. The top of the inclined axis may be brought into slight

contact with the blackened surface of the paper by lowering the brass frame on the

stand by means of a micrometer-screw, so as to maintain the contact for some time.

 The  specimens     of  curves  described  by the  apparatus  show that without  any

_

distiu-bing force the top describes a circle.

If we put a circular disk excentrically on the axis of the apparatus, it still describes

a circle, but also an ellipse revohdng on its periphery, whose lenffth of axis de-

pends on the weight of the circidar disk fastened to the axis. If the top marks

for a longer time, instead of a circle a spiral line is described, with ellipses revolv-

ing on it.

 Diagrams   were    exhibited,  showing    the  same curves, but with heavier  circular

_

disks on the axis.

   These experiments may be made also by putting on the top of the axis a globule

of silvered glass, reflecting the light of the sun, or of a lamp, showing at a con-
siderable distance the pretty designs of the nutation curves. It is very instructive
to exhibit and explain the complicated phenomena of the luni-solar precession and
nutation of the earth's axis by the same apparatus.

   The combined action of the sim and moon's masses on the earth are represented
by the small paper sheets put excentrically on the axis of the rotating brass disk

of the apparatus.

   The sun and moon's distances from the centre of the earth continually changing,

produce the same effect as those circular disks put excentrically upon the axis of
the apparatus, and produce an entirely similar motion of the axis of the earth,

describing likewise a cone, or a circle on the top of the earth's axis ; and by the
changing action of the sun and moon at different distances from the earth, there is

mproduced an additional small elliptical motion, quite similar to those represented
    the diagrams exhibited. Similar but still larger elliptical motions are produced
in the same manner by the combined and varying action of the sun and earth's

masses on the moon, known in astronomy as the precession of the nodes of the
moon, and as the nutation and evection of its axis.

   In correcting astigmatic defect, the cylindrical lenses being piano-, and the edges
groimd to the same exact diameter as the spherical, they tit together and act as
one lens.

of illumination for lighthouses are generally admitted. There are, however, many

cases, such as harbour-lights and ship-lights, where the expense of construction
becomes a barrier to the employment of refracting apparatus.

   In order to reduce the expense, it occurred to the author that it would be de-
sirable to revive the old form of miiTor, consisting of facets of ordinary silvered

glass. Instead of making them small and with plane surfaces, the size may be
much increased ; and they may be bent or groimd and polished on both faces to
curves osculating the parabola, ellipse, or whatever form may be required. If the

edges of these facets wei'e fixed together by Canada balsam (a substance which has
nearly the same index of refraction as plate-glass), the large loss of light which
takes place at tlie edges of each facet in the old reflectors will be in great measure
saved. There will not, as formerly, be any refraction of the rays in passing through
the edges, and thus the whole will become practically monodioptric ; or, in other
words, will be optically nearly the same as if the paraboloid had been made of one
whole sheet of glass, while the advantage due to accurately cm-ved sm-faces, in-
stead of plane surfaces, will be secured. It woiild be a further improvement to

select dinerent points in the flame for the foci of the different facets, so as to

secure the useful destination of more of the rays. Besides, by grinding each facet
to different vertical and horizontal curves, the light maj' be condensed or diverged

by means of a single agent ; and the same result may be effected with different

totally reflecting plates of flint or other glass cemented to lighthouse prisms with

Canada balsam, so as to form composite prisms. When coloured lights are wanted,

the facets would consist of glass tinted to the required hue, so as to render stained
muffles or chimneys unnecessary. The economy of the proposed method of con-
struction will render it peculiarly applicable to harbour-lights and ship-lights.

   The author exhibited a paraboloidal reflector constructed on the method to
which he refen-ed. The facets were successfullj^ constructed by Messrs. Chance,
of Birmingham. The pieces of glass having been first bent upon a mould, were
afterwards ground by rubbing-surfaces worked by machinery of the same kind as
is employed for dioptric apparatus. The facets were afterwards silvered by the
patent process of ^Messrs. Pratt and Co., of St. Helens, Lancashire, who inform the
author that so long as the paint is not removed from the back of the silvering its
reflecting power will remain unaltered.

  --Differejitial metallic Mirror and Holopliote. The same construction may also be

 adopted, as the author has already hinted, for producing a differential holopliote
which will, Inj means of sinr/le optical ar/ents, collect, with uniform density in azimuth,
the whole spihere of diverc/inff rays into any r/iren cylindric sector. For such a piu'-
pose each facet must, in the vertical plane where no divergence is wanted, be
groimd to a parabolic profile, while in the horizontal it must be of such hA^per-

bolic, elliptic, or other cun-e as wiU give the required horizontal divergence with-
out interference with the apparatus for the central cone of rays, which wiU be
dealt with according to the requirements of the case, by means either of Fresnel's

--beehive fixed apparatus or of a differential lens an instrument whicli the author

 has elsewhere described. In order to test the practicability of such an arrange-
ment, a mirror was constructed of small glass facets, which were arranged optically
 on a surface of putty, and which answered the purpose as far as was possible with
plain pieces of glass. The author sees therefore no gi-eat difficulty in making this

new kind of mirror of separate facets of silvered glass of small size ; but he found

such difliculties in constructing one with a continuous surface that he consulted

his friend Professor Tait, who kindly gave him his assistance in the solution of
this difiicult problem by suppljang the general formula ; and he lias no doubt, now

that the simpler form of facet has been so successfully constructed, a differential
holophote will soon be made.

for nearly forty years a favourite subject of study with the late Mr. Harcourt.

Having commenced in 1834 some experiments on vitrifaction, veith the object stated

in the title of this notice, he was encouraged by a recommendation, which is printed

in the 4th volume of the Transactions of the British Association, to pursue the

Asubject further.  report on a gas-furnace, the construction of which formed a

preliminary inquiry, in which was expended the pecimiary grant made by the

Association for this i-esearch in 1836, is printed in the Report of the Association

for 1844, but the results of the actual experiments on glass have never yet been

published.

  My own connexion with these researches commenced at the Meeting of the
British Association at Cambridge in 1862, when Mr. Harcourt placed in my hands

some prisms formed of the glasses which he had prepared, to enable me to determine

their character as to fluorescence, which was of interest from the circumstance
that the composition of the glasses was known. I was led indirectly to observe the

fixed lines of the spectra formed by means of them ; and as I used simlight, which
he had not found it convenient to employ, I was enabled to see fm'ther into
the red and violet than he had done, which was favom-able to a more accurate

measure of the dispersive powers. This inquiry, being in furtherance of the
original object of the experiments, seemed far more important than that as to

fluorescence, and caused Mr. Harcourt to resume his experiments with the liveliest

interest, an interest which he kept up to the last. Indeed it was only a few days

before his death that his last experiment was made. To show the extent of the

research, I may mention that as many as 166 masses of glass were formed and cut

ijito prisms, each mass doubtless in many cases involving several preliminary

experiments, besides disks and masses for other purposes. Perhaps I may be

permitted here to refer to what I said to this Section on a former occasion* as

to the advantage of working in concert. I may certainly say for myself, and I

think it will not be deemed at all derogatory to the memory of my esteemed

friend and fellow-labourer if I say of him, that I do not think that either of us

working singly coidd have obtained the results we arrived at by working together.

It is well known how difiicult it is, especially on a small scale, to prepare

homogeneous glass. Of the first gi'oup of prisms, 28 in number, 10 only were

sufficiently good to show a few of the principal dark lines of the solar spectrum

the rest had to be examined by the bright lines in artificial sources of light.

These prisms appeared to have been cut at random by the optician from the mass

of glass supplied to him. Theory and observation alike showed that strife interfere

comparatively little with an accurate determination of refractive indices when

they lie in planes perpendicular to the edge of the prism. Accordingly the prisms

used in the rest of the research were formed from the glass mass that came out

of the crucible by cutting two planes, passing through the same horizontal line a

little below the surface, and inclined 221° right and left of the vertical, and by

polishing the enclosed wedge of 45°. In the central portion of the mass the striae

have a tendency to arrange themselves in nearly vertical lines, from the operation

of currents  of convection                                                                   and  by  cutting  in  the  manner described,  the  most
                                                                                          ;

favourable direction of the striae is secured for a good part of the prism.

This attention to the direction of cutting, combined no doubt with increased

experience in the manufacture of glass, was attended with such good results that

now it was quite the exception for a prism not to show the more conspicuous dark

lines.

   On account of the inconvenience of working with silicates, arising from the

diflniculty of fusion and the pasty character of the fused glasses, Mr. Harcourt's

experiments were chiefiy can-ied on with phosphates, combined in many cases

with fluorides, and sometimes with borates, tmigstates, molybdates, or titanates.
The glasses formed involved the elements potassium, sodium, lithium, barium,

strontium, calcium, glucinum, magnesium, aluminium, manganese, zinc, cadmium,

tin, lead, thallium, bismuth, antimony, arsenic, tungsten, molybdenimi, titanium,

vanadium, nickel, chromium, uranium, phosphorus, fluorine, boron, sulphur.

  A verj^ interesting subject of inquiiy presented itself collaterally with the

original object, namely, to inquire whether glasses could be found which would

achromatize each other so as to exhibit no secondary spectrum, or a single glass
which would achromatize in that manner a combination of crown and flint.

This inquiry presented considerable difficulties. The dispersion of a medium is

small compared with its refraction ; and if the dispersive power be regarded as a

small quantity of the first order, the irrationality between two media must be

regarded as depending on small quantities of the second order. If striae and

imperfections of the kind present an obstacle to a very accurate determination of

dispersive power, it wiU readily be understood that the errors of observation

which they occasion go far to swallow up the small quantities on the observation

of which the determination of irrationality depends. According^, little success

attended the attempts to draw conclusions as to irrationality from the direct obser-

vation of refractive indices ; but by a particular method of compensation, in

which the experimental prism was achromatized by a prism built up of slender

prisms of cro^vn and flint, I was enabled to draw ti'ustworthy conclusions as to

the character in this respect of those prisms which were sufliciently good to show

a few of the principal dark lines of the solar spectrum.

Theoretically amj three difi"erent kinds of glass may be made to form a combi-

nation achromatic as to secondary as well as primary colour, but practically the

character of dispersion is usually connected with its amount, in such a manner

that  the determinant       of  the  system                                                                                                                                                             of  three  simple                                          equations    which  must   be

hopes of success. Mr. Hai'court warmly entered into this subject, and prosecuted

his experiments with unwearied zeal. The earlier molybdic glasses prepared were
many of them rather deeply coloured, and most of them of a perishable nature.
At last, after numerous experiments, molybdic glasses were obtained pretty free

from colour and permanent. Titanium had not yet been tried, and about this time

a glass containing titanic acid was prepared and cut into a prism. Titanic acid

proved to be equal or superior to molybdic in its power of extending the blue end

of the spectrum more than corresponds to the dispersive power of the glass ; while

in every other respect (freedom from colour, permanence of the glass, greater abun-

dance of the element) it had a decided advantage ; and a great variety of titanic
glasses were prepared, cut into prisms, and measured. One of these ^led to the

suspicion that boracic acid had an opposite effect, to test which Mr. Harcom-t

formed some simple borates of lead, vrith varying proportions of boracic acid.

These fuUy bore out the expectation                                                                                                                                                                     the terborate for instance, which in dispersive

power nearly agrees with flint glass, agi-ees on the other hand, in the relative

extension of the blue and red ends of the spectrum, with a combination of about

one part, by volume, of flint glass with two of crown.

  By combining a negative or concave lens of terborate of lead with positive

lenses of crown and flint, or else a positive lens of titanic glass with negative

lenses of crown and flint, or even with a negative of very low flint and a positive

of crown, achi-omatic triple combinations free from secondary colour may be formed

without encounteriag (at least in the case of the titanic glass) formidable cm-vatures
and by substituting at the same time a titanic glass for crown, and a borate of lead

for flint, the curvatures may be a little ftu-ther reduced.

   There is no advantage in using three different kinds of glass rather than two to
form a fully achromatic combination, except that the latter course might require
the two kinds of glass to be made expressly, whereas with three we may employ
for two the crown and flint of commerce. Enough titanium might, however, be

introduced into  a  glass   to  render  it                                                                                                                                                              capable of being                                           pferfectljy  achromatized  bjy

   In a triple objective the middle lens may be made to fit both the others, and be

cemented. Terborate of lead, which is somewhat liable to tarnish, might thus be
protected by being placed in the middle. Even if two kinds only of glass are
used, it is desirable to divide the convex lens into two, for the sake of diminish-

ing the curvatm-es. On calculating the curvatui-es so as to destroy spherical as

well as chromatic aberration, and at the same time to make the adjacent surfaces
fit, very suitable forms were obtained with the data furnished by Mr. Harcourt's

glasses.

   After encountering great difficulties from striae, ]\Ii'. Harcourt at last succeeded
in preparing- disks of terborate of lead and of a titanic glass which are fairly
homogeneous, and with which it is intended to attempt the construction of an
actual objective which shall give images free from secondary colour, or nearly so.

   This notice has extended to a greater length than I had intended, but it still

gives only a meagre account of a research extending over so many years. It is

my intention to draw up a full account for presentation to the scientific world in

some other form. I have already said that the grant made to Mr. Harcourt for
these researches in 1836 has long since been expended, as was stated in his Report
of 1844; but it was his wish, in recognition of that grant, that the first mention
of the results he obtained should be made to the British Association ; and I doubt
not that the members will receive with satisfaction this mark of consideration,

which they will connect with the memory of one to whom the Association as a

body is so deeply indebted.

On one Cause of Trayisparency . By G. Joknsxone Stoney, M.A., F.E.8.

   The motion of the aether which constitutes light is known to be subject to four

--restrictions : First, it is periodic ; secondly, it is transversal ; thirdly, it is (at all

events temporarily) polarized ; and, fourthly, its periodic time lies between the

limits which con-espond to the extent of the visible spectrimi. By temporary

polarization is meant the persistence of the same kind of wave over a lon^ series of

waves before waves of another kind succeed, that persistence which the phenomena

of difiFraction have made known to us *.

And the many respects in which radiant heat and light have been found to be

identical enable us to say that the first three of the foregoing restrictions apply to

Weradiant heat.  also know (see '^Philosophical Magazine' for April and for

July 1871) that the lines in the spectra of gases arise from periodic motions in the

molecules of the gas, each such motion giving rise to one or more lines corre-

sponding to terms of an harmonic series. And we know that under certain con-

ditions these lines dilate and run into one anothei-, so as in many cases to produce

regions of continuous absorption. All these phenomena may safely be attributed

to periodic motions in the molecules of the gas, the dilatation of the lines being

due to perturbations which aiiect the periodic times. After the periodic time has

been distiu-bed (probably on the occasion of the collisions between molecules) it

seems to settle down gradually towards its normal amount,.thus imparting breadth

--to the corresponding spectral lines.
   The question now naturally presents itself What results from motions in the
molecules which are not periodic, or which are in any other way imfitted to pro-
duce radiant heat ? And here the phenomena of acoustics come to our aid. Wnen

a bell is struck, more or less regularly, periodic motions are both produced. The
more regularly periodic motions produce the tone of the bell which is heard at a

distance, while the less regular motions, though they are often very intense, pro-

duce a clang heard only in the vicinity of the bell ; in other words, the energy is

expended in the neighbourhood of the bell. Similarly, if the molecules of abody
are engaged in irregular motions, such motions, though they may occasion a violent

agitation of the others, are mechanically incapable of producing such an imdulation

as constitutes radiant heat. The disturbance is necessarily local ; in other words,
as much energy is restored by the moving sether to the molecules as isimparted by

the motion of the molecules to the sether. This absence of radiation is one of the

properties of a transparent body ; and the other thermal (or optical) properties of

transparent bodies may be presimied to depend also on these partially irregular
motions. Thus Fizeau has proved by experiment that a flow of water of about

   * Eays of common light have been found to interfere, of which one was retarded 15

millims., or about 30,000 wave-lengths, behind the other, showing what a long series of
nearly similar waves usually succeed one another in unpolarized light before waves of

another type come in.
--42 REPORT 1871.

seven metres per second produced a very sensible effect on the velocity -with which

light was propagated in the direction of the motion ; in other words, when the

molecular motions had a preponderance in one direction, this was found to alter

the refi-active index in that direction. This shows that the molecular motions do

affect the refractive index ; and it is perhaps not too much to presume that the

phenomena of the irrationality of the spectra produced by prisms of different mate-

rials of double refi'action and polarization in crystals of^ other than the cubical

system, and of circular polarization in solids and liquids, will be found to residt

from modifications of the irregular motions either of or within the molecides.

Other facts appear to confirm this presumption : where from the form of a crystal

we have reason to suppose that the irregular molecular motions are not symme-

trically distributed in different directions, there we uniformly find the phenomena

of double                                   refraction                                               and  in  those  solids where they are  symmetrically disposed
                                                                                                  ;

the refraction becomes double if they are exposed to strain, i. e. as soon as an

unsymmetrical distribution of the molecular motions is artificially induced.

   On the whole we appear j ustified in drawing the probable inference that all the
phenomena of transparency are intimately associated witli the molecular motions

which want that kind of" regularity which would fit them to be the source of

luminous undulations. What is certain is, first, that certain periodic molecidar

motions do produce the phenomena of opacity in gases ; and secondly, that iiTe-

gular molecular motions are incapable of producing the effect of opacity, since they

cannot radiate. By irregular motions, where the phrase occurs in this communi-

cation, are to be understood motions which are not approximately periodic, or

which from any other cause cannot set up in the aether such an imdulation as that

which constitutes radiant heat.

On the advantage of referring the positions of Lines in the Spectrum to a Scale

         of Wave-numbers. By G. Johnstone Stoney, M.A., F.R.S.

 _ At the last Meeting of the British Association Mr. Stoney made a communica-
tion, from which it seemed to appear that each periodic motion in the mole-

cules of a gas will in general (i.e. unless the motion be a simple pendulous

one, or else mechanically small) give rise to several lines in the spectrum of the

gas, and that the lines which thus result from one motion have periods that are

harmonics of the periodic time of the parent motion. Since tliat time he has been

engaged, in conjunction with Dr. Emerson Reynolds, of Dublin, in testing this

theory                                      and in this                     inquiry it has been                      found    convenient    to refer the positions of
                                ;

all lines in the spectrum to a scale of reciprocals of the wave-lengths. This scale

has the great convenience, for the purposes of the investigation, that a system of

lines with periodic times that are harmonics of one periodic time are eqiiidistant

upon it                                     and it has the fm'ther convenience, which recommends it for general use,
                                         ;

that it resembles the spectrum as seen in the spectroscope much more closely than

the scale of direct wave-lengths used by Angstrom in his classic map.
   The position marked 2000 upon this scale occurs about the middle of the

spectrum, and corresponds to Angstrom's wave-length 5000. The numbers which

Angstrom uses are tenth-metres, i. e. the lengths obtained by dividing the metre

into  10'°                                  parts                           and                      from this it    follows  that  each  number on the new  scale
                                                                         ;

signifies the number of light-waves in a millimetre : thus 2000 upon a map drawn

to this scale marks the position of the ray whose wave-length is ^^^ of a milli-
metre. The new scale may therefore be appropriately called a" scale of wave-

numbers. If, then, Jc be the wave-number of a fundamental motion in the aether,

its wave-length will be- th of a millimetre, and its harmonics will have the wave-

-- --lengths                                                                &c. ; in other words, they occupy the positions 2k, Bk, &c. upon
                                                          ,

the new map. Hence it is easy to see that a system of lines which are equally
spaced along the map at intervals of k divisions are harmonics of a fundamental

motion whose wave-number is k, whose wave-length is -th of a millimetre, and

                                                                            rC

sether consisting of waves one niilliraetre long. If we use Foucault's determination

of the velocity of light, viz. 298,000,000 metres per second, the value of this

constant is

                =T 3'3557 twelfth-seconds,

meaning by a twelfth-second a second of time divided by 10^^, which, in other

words, is the millionth part of the millionth of a second of time.

   Thus the proposed numbers give the same information as a list of direct wave-
lengths, and in a more commodious form for theoretical purposes; while at the
same time the map of the spectrum dravni to this scale is to be preferred for use
in the laboratory, because it represents the spectrum formed by a prism with com-
paratively little distortion. This will be apparent from the following Table of the
wave-numbers of the principal lines of the solar spectrum :

Description of Eccperiments made in the Physical Laboratory of the University
   of Glasgow to determine the Surface Conductivity for Heat of a Copper Ball.

   By Donald M'Faelane.

The experiments described in this paper were made under the direction of Sir
AW. Thomson dming the summers of 1865 and 1871.
                                                 hot copper ball, having a

thermoelectric jimction at its centre, was suspended in the interior of a closed

space kept at a constant temperatiu-e of about 16° Cent., the other junction was

kept at the temperature of the envelope, the circuit was completed through a

mirror galvanometer, and the deflections noted at intervals of one minute as the

ball gi-adually cooled.

   The method of reducing the observations was explained at length. The difference

of the Napierian logarithms of the differences of temperatures of the junctions,
indicated by the defections, divided by the intervals of time, gives the rate of
cooling ; and this, mLiltiplied by a factor depending on the capacity for heat of the

ball and on the extent of its surface, gives the quantity of heat emitted in gramme

water units in the unit of time per square centimetre, per 1° of difference of teni-
peratm'es. Formulae were given which express the results of the experiments very
closely, and a table calculated by them exhibits the rates of emission for every 5°

of difference throughout the range.

   The first and second series had a range of from 5° to 2o° only, which was too
small to give decided results ; but the third and fourth series, made with a polished

copper surface and a blackened surface respectivelv, gave variations in the emissive
power from -000178 at .5° diff. of temperature to ·000226 at 60° difl". for the polished
sm-face, and from -000252 at 5° diff. to -000328 at 60° diff. for the blackened sm-
face ; and the emissive powers of the two surfaces exhibit throughout a nearly

constant ratio to each other of about -694.

   This instrument comhines the advantages of the charcoal and the cotton-wool
respirators. The respirator is intended to be fitted on the heads of firemen, and it
will enable a fireman to enter into the midst of any smoke, however dense. There
is sufficient protection for the eyes, by means of glasses. The results of an experi-
ment with the respirator have been stated by Prof. Tyndall. In a small cellar-like

chamber, fm-naces containing resinous pine-wood were placed, and the wood being
lio-hted, a dense smoke was generated. In this room. Prof. Tyndall and his
assistant, using these respirators, remained for more than half an hour, when the
smoke was so dense and pungent that a single inhalation through the unprotected
mouth and nostrils would have been perfectly unendurable. The instrument has
been tested by Capt. Shaw, chief officer of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, who
has taken very great interest in perfecting it, by attaching to it suitable hoods.

On the Temperature-equilibriwm of an Enclosure in which there is a Body in
               Visible Motion. By Prof. Balfour Stewaet, F.B.S.

It is now several years since Professor Tait and the author of this paper came

jointly to entertain the belief that there is some transmutation of energy, the

exact nature of which is unknown, when large bodies approach or recede from one

--another. It is desirable to vindicate an idea of this nature, both from the theo-

retical and the practical point of view that is to say, we ought, if possible, to

exhibit it as a probable deduction from those laws of nature with which we are

ali'eady acquainted ; and, on the other hand, it ought to be supported by observa-

tions and experiments of a new kind. In om* case the experiments and observations

have been of a difficult nature, and are yet in progress                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                it is therefore premature to
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

Abring them before the notice of the Association.  theoretical vindication of the

idea has been obtained by Professor Tait, and more recently one has occurred to

the author of these remarks, which he now ventures to bring forward. Men

of science are now sufficiently well acquainted with Provost's theory of exchanges,

Weand its recent extension.  know that in an enclosure, the walls of which are

kept at a constant temperature, every substance will ultimately attain the very-

same temperature as these walls, and we know also that this temperature-equili-

brium can only be brought about by the absorption of every particle being exactly

equal to its radiation, an equality which must separately hold for every individual

kind of heat which the enclosure radiates. This theoretical conclusion is sup-

ported by numerous experiments, and one of its most important applications has

been the analysis of the heavenly bodies by means of the spectroscope. Let us

now suppose that in such an enclosure we have a body in visible motion, its tem-

perature, however, being precisely the same as that of the walls of the enclosure.

Had the body been at rest, we know from the theory of exchanges that there

would have been a perfect equilibrium of temperature between the enclosure and

the body ; but there is reason to believe that this state of temperature-equilibrium

is broken by the motion of the body. For we know both from theory and expe-

riment that if a body, such for instance as a star, be either rapidly approacliing the

eye of an observer or receding from it, the rays from the body which strike the eye

will no longer be precisely the same as would have struck it had the body been at

--the same temperature and at rest ^just as the whistle of a railway engine rapidly

approaching an observer will have to him a different note from that which it

would have had if the engine had been at rest. The body at motion in the

enclosure is not therefore giving the enclosure those precise rays which it would

have given it had it been at the same temperature and at rest ; on the other hand,

the rays which are leaving the enclosure are unaltered. The enclosure is there-

fore receiving one set of rays and giving out another, the consequence of which

will be a want of temperature-equilibrium in the enclosure, in other words, all

the various particles of the enclosure will not be of the same temperature. Now,

what is the consequence of this ? The consequence will be that we can use these

particles of different temperatm-e so as to transmute part of their heat into the

energy of visible motion, just as we do in a steam-engine ; and if it is allowable to
suppose that during this process the moving body has retained all its energy of

motion, the result will be an increase of the amount of visible energy within the

enclosure, all the particles of which were originally of the same temperature. But

Sir W. Thomson has shown us that this is impossible ; in other words, we cannot

imagine an increase of the visible energy of such an enclosure imless we acknow-

ledge the possibility of a perjoetual motion. It is not, therefore, allowable to sup-

pose that in such an enclosure the moving body continues to retain all its energy
of motion, and consequently such a body will have its energy of motion gi-adually
stopped. Evidently in this argument the use of the enclosure has been to enable

us to deduce our proof from the known laws of heat and energy, and we may alter
the shape of the body without affecting the result ; in other words, we should

expect some loss of visible energy in the case of cosmical bodies approaching or
receding from one another.

             On a new Steam-gauge. By Prof. Ch. V. Zengtie.

This gauge is intended to avoid the defects of common air-gatiges, which have
                       ----

46 REPORT 1871.

hitherto prevented the employment of the air-manometer, and at the same time

to be more accurate and unalterable in its working than the spi-ing gauges now
commonly used for steam-boilers. lu the first place, it is a great defect in the
common air-gauge that the divisions on the manometric tube diminish rapidly at

high pressm-es, and consequently the reading becomes less and less accurate the
higher the pressure. The new steam-gauge, on the contrary, possesses the same
degree of accuracy at all pressures, and even enables us to make the accuracy of

reading greater at higher pressures.^
    Another serious defect of the air-manometer is the liability to rupture of the

narrow column of mercury when the steam is suddenly shut off or turned on.
This is entirely avoided in the present instrument by the use of two closed vessels
communicating with each other only by very narrow capillary tubes. Finally, the
small column of mercury enclosed iu the glass tube of common air-manometers is
subject to capillary depression, and to the disturbing eflects of heat upon the air-

bulb and upon the mercuiy.

   In the instrument now to be described it is sought to avoid these defects by not

using capillary tubes for the manometer, and by disposing the air and mercury in

such a way as to make the effect of heat insensible.
   The air-tube of the manometer consists of a series of tubes of equal length, but

different diameters, joined together by means of a blowpipe, and ending at the
top in a glass bulb. The lower end is connected by an air-tight screw, joined
with the first of two iron vessels containing each mercury or some other liquid,

and communicating only by a very narrow capillary tube or channel.
   The manometric tube is sealed at the bottom, but there are two fiue capillary

openings through the side at points below the sui'face of the mercury or other
liquid contained in the two iron vessels. Hence the communication of pressure

from the steam or other compressed gas, whose pressure is to be measured, and

which presses directly upon the surface of the liquid in the second iron vessel, can
only take place through a system of two capillary channels ; and the resistance
which these channels oppose to the motion of the mercury, by which they are
filled, makes it impossible for sudden changes to occur in the height of the mano-
metric column, and thus entirely prevents the di\'ision of the column or the entry

of steam or gas into the manometer.
   The capacities of the tubes and of the globe, which compose the manometric

tubes, are so adjusted that they decrease in the same ratio in which the pressure
increases, which is e^adently what is required by Mariotte's law in order that an

increase of pressure of one atmosphere may cause the first tube to be filled by the
enclosing liquid, and that a further increase of pressure of the same amount may

cause the second tube to be filled, and so on, each equal increment of pressure

--causing the same rise of the liquid in the manometric tube. This adjustment of

the capacities is efi'ected as follows : Let the capacity of a manometer, to be di-

vided so as to show pressures up to, say, four atmospheres, be called unity, and let
^i) i^-i) '^si find Wj be the capacities of the first, second, and third tube and of the

        On the Influence of Clean and Unclean Surfaces in Voltaic Action.

        By Thomas Bloxam, Lecturer on Cliemistnj, Cheltenham College.

    1. Gas was evolved by the contact of zinc and platinum surfaces, then an equal
amount from the same surfaces when the platinum had been cleaned by hot oil
of vitriol; the time was exactly half when the clean surfaces were used; contact of
the surfaces with the fingers or dipping them in solutions of various substances was
found to retard the evolution in a very marked degree.

    2. Heating the platinimi in a measure cleaned it, but not so satisfactorily as hot
oil of vitriol. Copper and other metals behaved similarly to platinum.

   ·3. Platinized silver, from its method of manufacture, appeared to be already
clean, no advantage being obtained by chemically cleaning it.

    4. Mechanically roughened surfaces of platinum exhibited a decided advantage
over smooth ones.

   5. The cell of a Smee's battery, examined by a galvanometer, gave vastly better
results when the negative plate had been chemically cleaned.

   6. Voltameters, the plates of which had been chemically cleaned, exhibited a
marked superiority over those not so cleaned ; thus it appears that in all voltaic
action the results are superior where the surfaces of the negative metals, elec-
trodes, &c. have been chemically cleaned, and that mere contact with the finger is
sufficient to modify the evolution of gases from the surface.

  On a new Form of Constant Galvanic Battery. By Latimer Clabe, C.E.

                   (Extracted from a Letter to Sir William Thomson.)

   I have spoken to you several times about a form of battery which can be set up
under such conditions as to ensure uniformity of tension within limits of about '05
or "06 per cent., and that without any special precautions as to the purity of the
materials employed. I have not yet been able to make the necessary experiments
for determining its value in absolute imits, though I hope shortly to have made
an independent determination. I have, however, set up about 200 of the
elements in question, and have measured them on about 30 different days;
and from the mean of these experiments, taking the Daniell at 1'079 volts, I make
this element to be 1'403 volts. In obtaining this result I have had to make care-
ful measurements of electromotive force of more than 1000 different elements,
comprising some 40 or 50 different kinds ; in fact I have been working at it for

six years.

   The element in question varies about '07 per cent, for each degree Centigrade,
getting weaker with increased temperature : the temperature at which our com-
parison with the Daniell's cell is made is 18° Centigrade.

   The element consists of a cylinder of pure zinc resting on a paste of protosulphate
of mercury and satm-ated solution of sulphate of zinc, previously boiled to expel the
air, the other electrode being metallic mercury, connexion being made with the
latter by a platinum wire. It is desirable that the materials should be pure ; but
if commercial materials be employed the error does not exceed -06 per cent, at first,
and after three or four hours the value becomes sensibly the same as with pure

materials.

   The precautions necessary are that the protosulphate of mercury should be free
from persulphate, and that the solution of persulphate of zinc should be supersatu-
rated. The elements do not vary sensibly for two or three months, say "05 per cent.

   It is essential that the element should not be worked through small interpolar

resistance ; but the measurement should be made by the use of a eondeuser, or,

myinfinitely better, by  " Potentiometer," which, -n-ith a Thomson's reflecting

galvanometer, readily measures to the millionth part of a Daniell's cell, or very

much less if required.

                  Notice of and Ohservations with a New Dip-circle.
                          By J. P. JoTTLE, LL.D., F.R.S., ^r.

   The method of suspension of the needle, which formed the principal feature of
the new instrument, was explained. The increased facilities of observation had

enabled the author to ti-ace the diurnal variation of inclination with greater

accuracy than he believed had hitherto been done. At Manchester, about the
summer solstice, the greatest inclination was found to occur at 21>> 40TM local time,
and the range extended to 5'. The simultaneous variation of horizontal intensity
was such as to indicate that the total intensity was very nearly a constant quantity.

           ByOn Tlif.rmo-eJectriclty.         Professor Tait.

It results from Thomson's investigations, founded on the beautiful discoveries of

Peltier and Gumming, that the graphic representation of the electromotive force of

a thermo-electric circuit, in tenns of temperatures as abscissae, is a cm've .symme-

trical about a vertical axis. This I have found to be, within the limits of experi-

mental error, a parabola in each one of a very extensive series of investigations

which I have made with wires of every metal I could procure. To veiify this

result with gTeat exactness, and at the same time to extend the trial to temperatures

beyond the range of a mercurial thermometer, I made a graphic representation, in

which the abscissaj were the successive indications of one circuit, the ordinates

those of another, the temperatures being the same in both. It is easy to see that

if the separate circuits give parabolas (as above ) in terms of temperatm'e, this pro-

cess also should lead to a parabola, the axis, however, being no longer vertical.

This severe test was well borne, even to temperatm"es approaching a didl red heat.

Unfortimately, it is difficult to procure wires of the more infusible metals, with the

exception of platinum and palladium, so that I have not yet been able to push this

test to very high temperatures. I hope, however, with the kind assistance of

M. H. Sainte-Claire DeviUe, to have wares of nickel and cobalt, with which to test

the parabolic law through a very wide range.

Parabolas being similar figures, it is easy to adjust the resistances in any two

Whencircuits so as to make their parabolas (in terms of temperature) equal.  this

is done, if the neutral points be different, it is obvious that by making them act in
opposite directions on a difterential galvanometer we shall have deflections directly

proportional to the temperature-difierences of the junctions.

It is a curious residt of this investigation, that, supposing the parabolic law to be

true, the Peltier effect is also expressed by a parabolic function of temperature,

vanishing at absolute zero.

I was led to this inquiiy by a hypothetical application of the Dissipation of

Energy to  what Thomson      calls  the  myelectric convection of heat, and  result  is

myverified (within the range of     experiments), that the specific heat of electricity

is directly proportional to the absolute temperature. It is scarcely necessary to

point out that the above results appear to promise a very simple solution of' the

problem of measuring high temperatm-es, such as those of fiu-naces, the melting-

points of rocks, &c.

sisted of three levers ; by pressing them down steel springs moved along a veiy

short, or along longer sheets of conducting material, and formed thus three signs
of different lengihs. Yet there was a certain time required to work the three keys
to obviate it, and to put the telegraphist entirely at his ease as to the speed attain-

able for him, and to obtain in such a manner the highest speed possible ^ I con-
structed the key in another manner.

  A clockwork arrangement moves a small wooden cylinder, whose steel axis is

attached to it by a handle, and rotates with great velocity, the rate of velocity
being accurately indicated by sounding a small bell as often in a second as the
cylinder will revolve in the same time.

   The wooden cylinder bears three thin circular disks of brass attached to the

steel axis of the cylinder ; these disks are differently cut out, in such a manner that

the first is a full circle of 300°, the second a sector of nearly 120^, the rest of the

circle being covered with an insulating material, viz. wood or india-rubber, to pre-

vent metallic contact.

   The third disk is only a segment of 10°, the rest being cut out and covered with

the insulating material.

    Three levers, put in front of the three disks, bear on their ends platinum wires or

plates that touch the disks during one revolution of the cylinder when pressed

down.

   From the levers a conducting-plate, uniting them, leads to the printing apparatus,
and the levers are reduced to their former position by strong steel springs, so that
they regain rapidly their positions after the pressure of the finger has ceased. What-
ever be the velocity of the paper and the rollers, and the clockwork moving it, the

relative length of the sizes and their distances remain imalterably the same.
   In the model presented to the General Post Office, the motion endures for 15

minutes, and, being only a model, it is worked hy a spring, and it has no rollers for

the paper.

   In the working apparatus for telegraphic use, the rollers and whole printing ap-
paratus are attached to the key, and the same clockwork moves both the rollers

and the rotating cylinder, forming thus only one apparatus together. From that
contrivance we obtain :

  A1. quite equal distance between the signs, as in printing.

  2. By putting the fans of the clockwork in differently inclined positions, the
velocity may be carried to as great an extent as a clever clerk can manage it.

   .3. By using three signs instead of two, the signs for letters, figm-es, and phrases
are reduced about one-third, and as much of time and space is spared.

                                                                                   Meteoeologt.

copious results of observations made by vessels crossing the ^ arious oceans in all

directions, there is great deficiency of actual observations at fixed points. After

pointing out the very important position occupied by the Azores, as illustrated by

the researches of Mr. Buchau and Prof. Mohn with reference to the normal tracks

of European storms, and also in their lying so completely in the path of merchant

vessels, Dr. Ballot explained that about five years ago he submitted to the

Biitish Admiralty a proposal for establishing a chain of barometric stations in tho

S. and W. of the British Isles, and at the Azores, and obtaining meteorological

reports from thence. In April 1806 he applied to the Portugue.se Government

                                  By William B. Caepentee, LL.D., M.D., F.B.S.

The object of this communication was to bring under the consideration of Phy-

sicists the fa.ct, ascertained by recent Deep-Sea explorations, of the general preva-

lence of a temperature not much above 32° F. over the bottom of the great Ocean-

beds, at depths greater than 2000 fethoms. As it has been proved by Temperature-

soundings made in the Mediterranean that the temperature of its bottom at like

depths is about 54° F., it is obvious that depth, per se, has no relation to the pheno-

menon. And the explanation of it propounded by the author is, (1) that a body of

Polar water flows over the deepest portions of the Oceanic basins which commimi-

cate with the Arctic and Antarctic areas (2) that this flow has its origin in the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

action of Polar cold on the water subjected to its influence, whereby a descending

movement is imparted to the whole mass ; besides which, the Polar colimm, in
virtue of its greater density, will have a gi-eater downward pressure than the

Equatorial                  column  at      the  same  level                      (3) that this bottom outflow will  produce
                                                                               ;

an indraught of the more superficial stratum of Ocean water towards the Polar

areas                       (4) and that a  vertical circidaiion will thus        be  maintained by dift'ereuce of
                         ;

Temperature alone, canying the lower cold stratum of Ocean water h-om the Polar

towards the Equatorial area, and the upper warm stratum from the Equatorial to-

wards the Polar.

  A diflerent explanation of the facts, however, has been oifered by those who

regard the Horizoniul Circulation, of which the Trade-winds are the jn-imum

mobile, as the sole cause of the amelioration of the temperature of the Arctic basin,

by an afiiux of warm water ; for it has been urged that the driving ofl" of the

superficial stratum of Equatorial water in the Gulf-stream must produce a partial

--void in that area, which will be filled by a deep indraught of Polar water. This

Aappears to the author extremely improbable, on general physical gTOunds.

horizontal movement of surface-water in the open Ocean would not draw up water

from below, so long as a lateral influx can keep up its level ; so that any such

horizontal Wind-current must have another horizontal movement to complete the

circulation. Such a horizontal complement is obvious in the case of the Gulf-

stream, of which one portion turns round the Azores to re-enter the Equatorial

current, thus completing the shorter circulation ; whilst the other portion, which
flows onwards in a N.E. direction, has as its complement the various cold

surface-cm-rents which are known to set southwards, and of wliicli it is shown by

recent observations that one tends towards the coast of Mogador, sending an ofiset

through the Strait of Gibraltar.

Further, it was argued by the author that the temperature-phenomena obtained

in recent explorations indicate tliat a N.E. movement of the upper stratum of

Oceanic water extends between the coast of Spain and the Faroe Islands to a depth

of 500 or 600 fathoms, and that while this cannot be attributed to any propulsive

action derived from the Gulf-stream (the thinned out edge of which is less than 50

fathoms in depth), it is exactly such a flow as wo\ild be anticipated on the hypo-

thesis of a vertical circulation sustained by opposition of Temperature.

               By the Rev. Professor Challis, M.A., LL.D., F.B.S.

    The purpose of the author in this communication was to point out a process of
analytical reasoning by which the solution of the problem of atmospheric tides
might be strictly derived from the general equations of hydrodynamics. For the
sake of simplicity, the surface on which the atmosphere rests was supposed to be
exactly spherical, the earth was conceived to have no motion of rotation, and the
tidal motion to be produced by the moon revolving westward in the plane of the
earth's equator, at her mean distance (R), and with the mean relative angular
velocity (/x). Also it was assumed that the relation between the pressure (p) and
density (p) is at all times and at all points of the atmosphere j9=ff-p, the eftects of

variation of temperature not being taken into account.

   As tidal motion is oscillatory, and the oscillations are so small that it is uu-

This integration gave, after omitting the extremely small quantity ^p^, the fol-

lowing value of (p, containing two arbitrary constants

                       = +4, (Cr- CV-3) cos^Xsin (2d-fjit).

   The remainder of the reasoning depends altogether on this value of (j), which
was considered by the author to be indispensable for tlie solution of the problem

of atmospheric tides, and, as far as he was aware, had not beon before employed

for that purpose.

For determining the three arbitrary quantities there are three conditions. That

introduced by the integration of equation (2) is determined by the condition

that at either pole of the earth the density has a constant value, because, as may

be inferred from the expression for </>, tlie aerial columns having their bases at

Athe poles are motionless.  second condition is, that at the earth's surface the

^, = ---vertical velocity,
                       is always zero                                                        so that  if b be the earth's radius,                        C'         .
                                                                                          ;

The third condition necessarily has reference to the circumstances of the fluid at

its superior boundary, respecting which the author argues as follows :

 _ That the height of the atmosphere is limited may be inferred from the considera-

tion that, by the continual diminution of the density with tlie distance from the

earth's surface, the upward molecular repulsion must eventually be no greater than
the downward acceleration of gravity, in which case there can be no further upward
action, and the fluid terminates by "an abnormal degradation of the density down

to zero at the extreme limit. The particles within the superficial stratum subjected
to this disturbance are maintained in equilibrium by the combined action of mole-
cular repulsion and the earth's attraction, till at a small distance from the extreme
limit, -where the abnormal variation of density ceases, the density is such as might
result from a very small constant pressure applied at all points of a surface bounding
a terminal densitj- of finite value. (Views of this liind respecting the condition of
the atmosphere at its superior limit were entertained by Poissou.) On these prin-
ciples it is eas}^ to find a mathematical relation between the terminal density and
the heiglit of the atmosphere. The author lias, in fact, made the calculation on
the supposition that the atmosphere is GO miles high, and obtains a terminal density

equal to six-millionths of that at the earth's surface.

   According to the above views a particle at tlie superior boundary may be sup-

posed to remain at the surface, and to be of the same density, in successive instants.

This condition is expressed by equating the complete difierential coefficient (^)

to zero. By moans of this additional equation the value of the constant C can be

calculated on assuming a certain height for the atmosphere.  Supposing the ]iei°"-ht

to be 60 miles, the author obtains C = 0-000000830 /z.

The arbitrary quantities being determined, tlie following results are readily

obtained :

Height of tide above the polar colunm, expressed in feet,

                  = 1-084 cos- X4- 1-275 cos= X cos 2((9-/xO.

At the equator, where X=0, difterence between high and low tide =2-55 feet.

Excess of barometer-reading above that at the pole, expressed in inches,

                =0-00117 cos=X + O-OO139cos=Xcos2(0-iLi<).

At the equator the maximum difterence of the barometer-readings =0-00278 in.

The data employed in calculating these coefticients were :

            R ~ yG ~ 70'  ~ 82^ ^ 289'
            ti(>3'

the density of air =0-0013, the density of mercury =13-568.

   The above determination of the maximum difterence of barometer-readings at the
equator admits of comparison with the results of barometric observations made at

St. Helena and at Singapore, as given in p. 129 of the Philosophical Transactions
for 1852. These results agree with the theory in placing the high tide immediately

imder the moon ; but the maximum difterence of readings is 0003G5 in. at St. Helena

and 0-00570 in. at Singapore. Both consequently are in excess of the theoretical value
0-00278 in. But it is to be remarked that the latter depends on the assumption
that the atmosphere is 00 miles high; if it had been supposed of less height, say
40 miles, there would have been a closer agreement between the observed and theo-

retical values.

   The author's theory accounts in a remarkable manner for the fact that although
for the atmosphere high tide occurs under the moon, there is reason to say that for
a general ocean of the uniform depth of three or four miles it would be low tide
under the moon. The explanation given by the theory is, that there is a certain
depth of ocean or height of atmosphere for which the tide becomes infinite, namely,
when the rate of propagation of waves, as due to the earth's attraction, is equal to
the rate of the moon's relative rotation about the eartli. In that case the tide
would be accumidative, and might be of unlimited amount. This critical deptli,
or height, is shown by the theory to be about 8-4 miles for each fluid. It is because
the actual mean depth of the ocean is less, and the actual height of the atmospliere
greater, than this critical value, that the ocean-tide imder the moon is the opposite

of the atmospheric tide.

     On Wet- and Dnj-hulh Formulce. Bi/ Prof. J. D. Everett, F.R.S.E.

   The author said August, Apjohn, and Regnault have investigated formul£e for
determining the dew-point, by calculation, from the temperatures of the dry- and
wet-bulb thermometers ; but Regnault's experiments on the specific heat of air
were not performed tiU a later date, and all these authors have adopted, in their
investio-ations, the value obtained by Delaroche and Berard, which is -267, whereas
the correct value is -237. But when this correct value is introduced into Beg-
nault's formula, the discrepancies which he foimd to exist between calculation and
observation are increased, and amount, on an average, to about 25 per cent, of the
difference between wet-bulb temperature and dew-point. August and Apjohn
erred in assuming that aU the air which gives heat to the wet bulb (1) falls to the tem-
peratm-e of the wet bvdb, and (2) becomes saturated. These two false assumptions
would jointly produce no error in the result, if the depressions of temperature in
the different portions of air affected were exactly proportional to their increments
of vapoiu'- tension, and if some of the air were saturated at the temperature of the
wet bulb. But it is probable that, when there is little or no wind, the mass of air
which falls sensibly in temperatiu'e is larger than that which receives a sensible
accession of vapour, and that, in high wind, the supposition that some of the air
has fallen to the temperature of the wet bulb is more nearly fulfilled than the
supposition tliat it has taken up enough vapour to saturate it. The effect of radi-
ation, which is ignored in the formulse, tends in the same direction as these two
inequalities, and all three are roughly compensated by attributing to air a greater
 specific heat than it actually has. The discrepancies above referred to are thus

 explained.

          On iJie General Circulation and Distribution of the Atmosphere.
                          By Professor J, D. Evebett, F.B.S.E.

    The object of this paper was to call the attention of meteorologists to a theory
 which is jointly due to Prof. James Thomson of Belfast, and Mr. Ferrel of Boston,
 U.S.A., and which gives the only satisfactory account of the grand currents of
 the atmosphere, and of the distribution of barometric pressure over the earth's
 sm-face, the irregularities arising from the distribution of land and water being
 neglected. Independent proofs were also given of some of Mr. Ferrel's results.

     In virtue of the earth's rotation, with angular velocity to, a body, in latitude X,
 moving along the earth's surface with relative linear velocity v, tends to describe
 on the earth's surface a cm-ve concave to the body's right in the northern and to its
 left in the southern hemisphere, the radius of cuvature of the concavity being

 6--8^50 V feet, if the velocity is in feet per second. The deflection from a parallel of

 latitude into a great circle is usually negligible in comparison, being represented

 Rby the curvatvu-e of a circle of radius RcotanX, where is the earth's radius.

     To keep the moving body in a gi-eat circle, or in a parallel of latitude, requires
  a constraining force per unit of mass equal to 2 to sin X . v, which if the foot and

  second be units, is -7^^^-=:^ ; and this formula applies alike to all horizontal directions
                                 bboU

  of motion.

     The air over the extra-tropical parts of the earth has, upon the whole, a relative
  motion towards the east, and therefore presses towards the tropics with a force
  which can be computed by the above formula, if the eastward velocity at each
  parallel is known. If v denote this velocity at any parallel, in feet per second,

  the increase of pressure per degree of latitude at tliat parallel is '0019 v sin X inches
  of mercury. This is sufficient to account for the ooserved increase of pressure

  fi-oni the poles to the tropics, which may be roughly stated at '01 inch per degree.
     Between the tropics, the general movement of the air, relative to the earth, is

  towards the west, and the increase of pressui-e is therefore from the equator towards

   the tropics.

      If any stratmn of air have less than the average eastward or westward ve-
  locity (relative to the earth) which prevails through the sti-ata above it, it will
                                                                                                  --

not be able to resist the differential pressure from or towards tlie equator which
their motion produces. For this reason, the lowest stratum of air, having its
velocity relative to the earth kept down by friction, generally moves from the
tropical belts of high barometer to the regions of low barometer at the poles and
equator. This is the origin of our S.W. winds, and of the prevalent N.W. winds
of the Southern oceans, which must be regarded as constituting an undercurrent

towards the pole, beneath a topmost cm'rent, also towards the pole, and a middle
return current. Between the tropics, on the other hand, the motion thus generated
in the lowest stratum of air coincides with the motion due to difference of tern-

peratm-e, and this is probably tlie reason why the trade-winds are more constant

than the winds of the temperate zones.
    Excess of temperature and moisture in the equatorial regions is unquestionably

the prime mover of the winds, as has long been believed ; but the crossing/ of the
winds at the tropic, which has often been coupled with it, is a physical im-

possibility.

   The tendency of a moving mass of air to swerve to its own right in the northern

hemisphere explains the well-established law (Buys Ballot's), that the -wind, in-

stead of blowing at right angles to the isobaric lines, and so running down the
steepest gi-adient, usually makes an angle of only 20° or 30° with these lines,
keeping the region of lower barometer on its left. The rotation of cyclones is an
example of this law ; and the pressure which the spirally inflowing sti-eams exert to
their own right in virtue of the earth's rotation is the main cause of the excessive

central depression.

port for 1857, and to papers by Mr. Ferrel in the 'American Mathematical Monthly
for 1860, and in ' Nature,' July 20, 1871.

Tlie Influence of the Moon on the Bainfall. By W. Pexgellt, F.B.S. 4'C.

   The author commenced by stating that though many of the popular beliefs re-
specting "The Moon and the Weather" were no doubt utterly untenable. Sir J.

Herschel and M. Arago coucmi-ed in the opinion that, on the whole, the rainfall
was somewhat below the general average about the time of fidl moon, and that the
fact was ascribable to the effect of the solar heat absorbed by the moon and

radiated by her to us. He then proceeded to show that the heat thus received by
us must be gi-eatest when, or -very soon after, the moon was full, when she was in
perigee, and (in the northern hemisphere) when she had north declination; that

the effect of this heat would be a diminution of the rainfall, not during the lunation

as a whole, but during a certain portion of it, and therefore an augmentation
during some other period ; that the effect would be variable and never considerable

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

and that in the northern hemisphere it would be a maximimi when the moon was,

at one and the same time, full, in perigee, and in her highest north declination.

The paper was illustrated with several tables and diagrams based on rainfall obser-
vations made at Torquay diu:ing eighty-seven complete lunations ending with

January 19, 1871.

The following were amongst the conclusions with which the paper closed :

No indication of the moon's influence on the rainfall can be detected in the data

furnished by an isolated lunation, or by even a few successive lunations.

Though it may be doubted whether the rainfall statistics of a period shorter than

that in which the moon's nodes complete a revolution, or of a solitary locality,

would justify general inferences, the data imder discussion appear to indicate that,

in the long rim, the moon does somewhat influence the rainfall ; that on the

average the dry period of a lunation extends from the flrst day before full moon to

the first day before the third quarter, and the wet period from the day of the first

quarter to the second day before  the  full  moon                                that the moon's  influence on the
                                                                              ;

number of wet days is less marked ; and that the rainfalls are, on the whole, rather

least hea'vy when the moon has north declination, and when she is in perio-ee all

indications harmonizing well with physical considerations.

show that vapour of water had no power of transmitting its radiant heat into space.
This proposition was supported hy arguments from various natural phenomena.

                     On Parhelia, or Moch Suns, observed in Ireland.

          By William A. Tkaill, of the Geological Survey of Ireland.

   The autlior hegan by stating that the above phenomena were analogous to the
  araselena3 or mock moons, and though of not unfi-eqnent occurence in northern
Iatitudes, were in these countries of great rarity. Tlie phenomena observed by
him were seen on the 28th of January, 1869, near the village of Strangford (Co.
Down), lat. 54° 21', long. 5° 35', west of Greenwich, and first appeared as three
brilliant suns situated in the same horizontal line, about 15° to 20° above the
horizon, and of equal brightness. The two outer, or mock suns, gradually assumed
tlie prismatic colours, and lengthening out joined above, thus forming the '' ordinary
halo," in which the red colour was nearest to the real sun. Concentric and exterior
to it was another prismatic halo, the " extraordinary halo/' which was rather
fainter, in which also the red colour was innermost.

   Touching this latter externally was the " circumzeuithal halo," which was by
far the most brilliant of the three, lying as if horizontally overhead. In this like-
wise the red colour was next the sun, thus forming the outer periphery of the halo.
The phenomena began a little after 2 p.m., and lasted only for about half an hour,
attaining its greatest splendour at 2'' 20TM p.m.

   Throughout the dm-ation of the phenomena the sky was of a clear blue colour,
and almost unobscured ; a few light fleecy clouds were, however, drifting northward,
slight " cirrus '' clouds stretched across part of the sky, from E. to W., a"nd through-
out the svhole time the points where the mock suns had first appeared continued

the brightest.

   With regard to the state of the weather at the time, the day was mild and fine,
no rain falling till the evening. The sun was warm, but a cold southerly wind
prevailed. The moon was full on the previous day, and exceptionally high spring-

tides occun-ed along the N.E. portion of the Irish' coast.

   The barometer fell rapidly -7 inch within twelve hours. The wind veered round
gradually through 140', and increased in velocity from G to 38 miles an hour, the
thermometer ranging from 42^ to 46°, and towards evening the rain descended in
torrents*. The succeeding ten days or fortnight was characterized by excessively
bad weather, rain, and storms.

   The autlior lastly touched on the different theories by which these phenomena
could be most easily accounted for.

   The author called attention to the number, variety, and importance of those
national duties, involving Science, which can be performed bv the Executive

Government alone. He pointed out that the English Government possesses

as yet no provision for regulating the performance of these duties in a systematic

manner. He niaintaiued that the requisite provision must consist of two addi-

tions to the existing administration, neither of which, however, imaccompanied
by the other would suffice--namely, first, a Minister of Science ; and, second,

a permanent ConsnltatiA'e Council^ to advise tlie various departments tlirougli
the Minister. His purpose was not to endeavour to uproot the existing
system, hut to graft upon it additions demanded by experience and the progress of
knowledge. Assuming that the INIinister would he appointed for his station,

parliamentary ability, and political iniluence, he would need advisers, who should

be a permanent, well-paid, and therefore a responsible Council of Science, repre-
senting all the main branches of science, the different arms of the military and
naval services, commerce, agriculture, and the engineering profession. The Council
should be quite independent of political influences. The author described the
mode of election to the Council which he proposed, and in which he would give a
certain voice to the Scientific Societies. The duties of the Council would be
first, to advise the Government on all questions arising in the ordinary routine of
administration submitted to it by the various departments ; second, to advise the

GoA'ernment on special questions, such as the founding of new scientific institu-

tions and the modification or abolition of old ones, the sanctioning of scientific
expeditions and applications for grants for scientific purposes ; third, to consider
and decide upon inventions tendered to Government for the use of the State; and,

fourth, to conduct or superintend the experiments necessary to enable it to perform
these duties. This would not entirel}' relieve the Government of all respousibility

in scientific matters. The advantages to the nation accruing from a sound and
comprehensive administration of science were incalculable.

   The author referred, for fuller particulars regarding the subject, to his pjiper

read before the Iloj'al United Service Institution on the 15th of May last, and

Obstacles to Science- TeacJiing in ScTiooh. Bjj the Key. W. Tuckwell.

After describing the slow progress made in scientific teaching since the Report

of the Public Schools' Commission in 1864, and declaring that the first-class

English schools teaching science systematically at the present momentcan b e

counted on the fingers of one hand, the author proceeded to show that the head

masters were not altogether to be blamed for this state of things.

They have inherited an order of tuition some hundred years old, fortified with

minute, unbroken venerable traditions, looked upon for ages past as the supreme

instrument and test of intellectual power, whole and complete in itself, supported

by immense experience, worked by tried machinery. Into the midst of this well-

mapped, well-proved system is thrust a strange and foreign subject, comprising

many branches, and demanding multifold appliances, whose value as a mental

weapon they have had no means of testing ; they are called upon to surrender to

this a portion of the time which alreadj' seems too short for other work, and to in-

augurate a department of school labour over which they can exercise no sort of

supervision or control. They ask for guidance in the new arrangements which

they are called upon  to  form                       whether anj^  one  department is educationally funda-
                                                  ;

mental to the rest ; whether sciences of experiment should precede or follow those

of observation ; what portions of the old course are to be abandoned; how far the

Universities, which in many cases stamp the practical value of their work, will

recognize such abandonment. They look round for accredited teachers and ap-

proved text-books, for enlightenment as to the amount of apparatus and its cost,

for details of teaching and of testing, and they look in vain. The}^ must fall back

upon their ov^ti moral consciousness, for no help is tendered to them from without. I

place this helplessness of head masters first on the list of obstacles which we

have to chronicle ; and I plead, for the moment, in their behalf, almost more

than in behalf of science. For their attitude is frauk and cordial; they are prepared

as a body to meet the demands of the scientific public loyally and with all their

might. If those who are pressing modern subjects on them will entertain their

just appeal and tryto understand their difficulties, they will prove the best auxiliaries

science can hope to gain ; for they will bring to this new department of their work

the same energy and wisdom, the same self-sacrificing impartial zeal, which have
                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

already won for them tlie deserved esteem of the community ; hut if we fail to
work in harmony with them, their want of sympathy and interest will be simply

fatal to our schemes.

   Next to this helplessness of head masters came the difficidty of obtaining pro-
perly trained and certificated science-teachers. With tlie admirable German

system, comprising special examination of Candidates for Masterships, not only in

knowledge, but in teaching power, together with a year of trial in some large

school before entering on their work, was compared the insufficient test offered hy

the English University Degree, a high test, no doubt, of intelligence and know-

ledge, but not of power to communicate knowledge or to infuse intelligence.
Third in rauli amongst the obstacles to be surmounted was placed the cost of

paying science masters ; and the School Commissioners, now redistributing the

endowments of the country, were urged to set apart funds for science-teaching in

every large school, and to insist on their being faithfully expended for the purpose.

The necessity of having good teachers was then dwelt on. The first condition of

success in scientific, as of other teaching, is obviously the teacher. He must be a

man thorough in his special knowledge, and, if his special knowledge is to be well
balanced in reference to other subjects, of the widest general cidture. He must

not spend all his time in teaching, but must have leisure to prepare lessons and

experiments. He must possess the delicate art of handling many pupils, the force

of manner which attracts them, the enthusiasm which puts and keeps them cit

rapport with him, the insight which reads their minds, the tact which can pre-

serve discipline without checking inquiry, and, possessing all this and more, he must

be well and highly paid.

An exact estimate was offered of the cost of                                                                     apparatus                                                and the value of  work-
                                                                                                                                                                       ;

shops, museums, and other accessories of the kind was dwelt upon.

After glancing at the action of the universities, the author touched on a grave

item in the catalogue of difficulties. Granting that scientific teaching is essential

demand of science, classical work must suffer. And, in order to solve this pro-

blem, some well-known schools have instituted a system of bifurcation, to which

the author was opposed. If linguistic training is bad without the rationalizing
aid of scientific study, no less is exclusive science bad when divorced from the

refining society of literatm-e and philology ; and an admission that certain institu-
tions stunt particular faculties is oddly followed by a device which causes each to

work unchecked. The difficulty must be met fairly, and on premises which

scholars as well as scivans can understand. It must be met by asking whether in

pm-ely classical schools no time is wasted ; why it is that in the lower forms

a boy takes years to master what a clever tutor teaches in a few months at home
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

why the weapon of analysis, which opens every other chamber of human know-

ledge, shotdd be discarded in the case of scholarship alone ; whether nnattractive-

ness is an inherent vice in Greek and Latin only, or whether, if judicious method

wakens pleasure and keeps alive attention, that of itself is not economy of time

whether, lastly, the day has not arrived when Greek and Latin verse-making may

not be allowed to disappear. After having written some thousand Greek and

Latin verses in his own school-days, the author pronounced them waste of time,

and protested against them altogether. Their elimination from om* school system
will be clear gain iu itself, and will set free at once a much larger amount of time

than is demanded for the prosecution of natin-al science.

   After enumerating at some length the details essential to the giving a fair

place to science in education, the paper ended as follows :--" The summary of

what I have to say is this, that our schools, in their readiness to establisli science,

must be aided from without. All questions of funds, of apparatus, of teachers, of

selected text-books, of coordinated subjects, of University influence, and of united

Weaction come to the same point at last.                                                           must have central leadership, at once

commanding and intelligent, if the introduction of science into our schools is to

be simultaneous and effective. The question has passed out of the realm of general

discussion ; it is ripe, if ever a question was, for detailed and practical settlement.

There must be within this Association, there must be within this room, men

qualified in all respects to appreciate the nature of our difBculties, to formulate

rules for our guidance, to press our pecuniary needs on those who are for a time

the bm-sars of our educational endowments, to watch and influence the action of
the Universities, as on other points, so especially in the projected 'Leaving Exa-
minations.' To them I confidently appeal. I appeal on behalf of coimtless schools,
which, ready to admit reform, are helpless to initiate it. I appeal on behalf of those
few schools which have initiated it, and are endeavouring courageously and honestly,

but with little of useful concert, with much of wasted force, to work it out. Let it

once be announced to the educational communit}' that a committee of distinguished
men, having at heart not merely scientific interests, but the interests of the Uni-
versities and the Schools, has been armed by this Association to counsel and to assist,
to recommend and to accredit, to harmonize and to combine, to become, in short,

the recognized representatives and controllers of scientific education, and they will
not lack grateful clients, or attain inadequate results. If science is to flourish in
the land, preliminary knowledge and training, bestowed with care upon our boy-
hood, must I'^ave our manhood free for original researcli. If our English educa-

tion is to be abreast of continental teaching, one half of our mental faculties
must no longer be suftered to lie dormant. To have removed this great reproach,
and to have helped this great reform, will be an achievement worthy to take high
rank even amongst those splendid services to science and to the community which
give lustre to the British Association."

Address hy Professor Andrews, F.R.S. L. <Sf E., President of the Section.

Amidst the vicissitudes to which scientific theories are liable, it was scarcely to

be expected that the discarded theory of Phlogiston should be resuscitated in our

day and connected with one of the most important generalizations of modern

science. The phlogistic theory, elaborated uearlj^ two hundred years ago by

Beecher and Stahl, was not, it now appears, wholly founded in error ; on the con-

trary, it was an imperfect anticipation of the great principle of energy, which

?lays so important a part in physical and chemical changes. The disciple of

'hlogiston, ignorant of the whole history of chemical combination, connected, it

is ti'ue, his phlogiston with one only of the combining bodies, instead of recog-

nizing that it is eliminated by the minor of all. " There can be no doubt," says

Dr. Crum Brown, who first suggested this view, " that potential energy is what

the chemists of the 17th century meant when they spoke of phloo-iston." " Phlo-

giston and latent heat," playfidly remarks Volhard, " which formerly opposed each

other in so hot a combat, have entered into a peaceful compact ; and, to banish all

recollection of their former strife, have assumed in common the new name of

energy." But, as Dr. Odling well remarks, "in interpreting the phlogistic writino-s

hj the light of modern doctrine, we are not to attribute to their authors the pre-
cise notion of energy which now prevails. It is only contended that the phlogis-

tians had in their time possession of a real truth in nature, which, altogether lost

sight of in the intermediate period, has since crystallized out in a definite form."

  But whatever may be the true value of the Stahlian views, there can be no

doubt that the discoveries which have shed so bright a lustre round the name of

ABlack mark an epoch in the histoiy of science, and gave a mighty impulse to
human progress.  recent attempt to ignore the labours of Black and his great

contemporaries, and to attribute the foundation of modern chemistry to Lavoisier

alone, has already been amply refuted in an able inaugural addi-ess delivered a

short time ago from the Chair formerly occupied by Black. The statements of
Dr. Crum Bro\vn may, indeed, be confirmed on the authority of Lavoisier himself.

Through the kindness of Dr, Black's representatives I have been permitted to
60 REPORT--1871.

examine his coi'respondence, \vliicli has been carefully preserved, and I have been
so fortunate as to find in it three original letters from Lavoisier to Dr. Black.
They were written in 1789 and 1790, and they appear to comprise the whole of
the correspondence on the part of Lavoisier which passed between those distin-

guished men. Some extracts from these letters were published soon after Dr.

Elack's death by his friends Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Robison ; but the letters

themselves, as far as I know, have never appeared in an entire form. I will crave
permission to have them printed as an appendix to this address *. Lavoisier, it

will be seen, addresses Black as one whom he was accustomed to regard as his

master, and whose discoveries had produced important revolutions in science. It
may, indeed, be said with truth that Lavoisier completed the foundation on which
the grand structure of modern chemistry has since arisen ; but Black, Priestley,
Schcele, and Cavendish were before Lavoisier, and their claims to a share in the
great work are not inferior to those of the illustrious French chemist.

  Among the questions of general chemistry, few are more interesting, or have of

late attracted more attention, than the relations which subsist between the che-
mical composition and refractive power of bodies for light. Newton, it will be
remembered, pointed out the distinction between the refractive power of a medium

--and its refractive index, and gave for the former the expression f-^ , where fi is

the refractive index, and d the density of the refracting medium. Sir J. Herschel,
anticipating later observations, remarked, in 1830, tliat Newton's function only ex-
presses the intrinsic refractive power on the supposition of matter being infinitely
divisible but that if material bodies consist of a finite number of atoms, differing

                                                 ;

in weight for different substances, the intrinsic refractive power of the atoms of
any given medium will be the product of the above function by the atomic
weight. The same remark has since been made by Berthelot. Later observations
have led to an important modification in the form of Newton's function. Beer
showed that the experiments of Biot and Arago, as well as those of Dulong, on
the refracti^·e power of gases, agree quite as well with a simpler expression as with
that given by Newton ; and Gladstone and Dale proposed in 1863 the formula

^ as expressing more accurately than any other the results of their experiments

on the refractive power of liquids. The researches of Landolt and AViilluer have

fully confirmed the general accuracj' of the new formula. An important observa-

tion made, about twenty years ago, by Delfts has been the starting-point for all
subsequent investigations on this subject. Delfts remarked that the refractive
indices of the compound ethers increase with the atomic weight, and that isomeric
ethers have the same refractive indices. The later researches of Gladstone and of
Landolt liave, on the whole, confirmed these observations, and have shown that
the specific refractive power depends chiefly on the atomic composition of the

body, and is little influenced by the mode of grouping of the atoms. These inquiries

have gone further, and have led to the discovery of the refraction-equivalents of

the elements. By comparing the refractive power of compound bodies diflfering

from one another by one or more atoms of the same element, Landolt succeeded in
obtaining numbers which express the refraction-equivalents of carbon, hydrogen,
and oxygen ; and corresponding numbers have been obtained for other elements
by Gladstone and Ilaagen. The whole subject has been recently discussed and
enriched with many new observations in an able memoir by Gladstone. As might
be expected in so novel and recondite a subject, some anomalies occur which are
diflicult to explain. Thus hydrogen appears in different classes of compounds with
at least two refraction-equivalents, one three times as gi-eat as the other ; and the
refraction-equivalents of the aromatic compounds and their derivatives, as given by
observation, are in general higher than the calculated numbers.

  A happy modification of the ice-calorimeter has been made by Bunsen. The

principle of the method (to use as a measure of heat the change of volume which
ice undergoes in melting) had already occurred to Herschel, and, as it now appears,
still earlier to Ilerniann ; but their observations had been entirely overlooked by
physicists, and had led to no practical residt. Bunsen has, indeed, clearly pointed

            * Ordered by the General Committee to be printed among the Eeports,
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  61

out that the success of the method depends upon an important condition, which is
entirely his own. The ice to be melted must be prepared witli water free from
air, and must surround the som-ce of heat in the form of a solid cylinder frozen

artificially in situ. Those who have worked on the subject of heat know how dif-

ficult it is to measure absolute quantities with certainty, even where relative

results of great accuracy may be attained. The ice-calorimeter of Bunsen will

therefore be welcomed as an important addition to our means of research. Bunsen
has applied liis method to determine the specific heats of ruthenium, calcium, and
indium, aud finds that the atomic weight of indium must be increased by one half

in order to bring it into conformity with the law of Diilong and Petit. He has
also made a new determination of the density of ice, which he finds to be 0-9167_.

   In a report on the Heat of Combination, which was made to this Association in
1849, the existence of a group of isothermal bases was pointed out. " As sonre of
the bases" (potash, soda, baryta, strontia), it was remarked, "form what we may
perhaps designate an isothermal group, such bases wiU develope the same or nearly
the same heat in combining with an acid, and no heat will be disengaged during
their mutual displacements. Tlie latest experiments of Thomsen have given a
remarkable extension to this group of isothermal bases. He finds that the hydrates
of lithium, thallium, calcium, and magnesium produce, when all con-ections are

made, the same amount of heat, on being neutralized by sulphuric acid, as the four
bases before mentioned. The hydrate of tetramethylammonium belongs to the
same class of bases. Ethylamin, on the other hand, agi-ees -with ammonia, which,
as has been long known, gives out less heat in combining with the acids than

potash or soda. An elaborate investigation of the amount of heat evolved in the

combustion of coal of difi'erent kinds has been made by Scheurer-Kestner and
Meusnier, accompanied by analyses of the coal. Coal rich in carbon and hydi-ogen
disengages more heat in burning than coal in which those elements are partially
replaced by oxygen. After deducting the cinders, the heat produced by the com-

bustion of 1 gramme of coal variedfrom 8215 to 9022 units.

    Tyndall has given an extended account of his experiments on the action of a

beam of strong light on certain vapours. He finds that there is a marked dif-

ference in the absorbing-power of different vapours for the actinic rays. Thus
nitrite of amyl in the state of .vapour absorbs rapidlj' the rays of light competent
to decompose it, while iodide of allyl in the same state allows them freely to pass.
MoiTen has continued these experiments in the south of France, and among other

 results he finds that sulphurous acid is decomposed by the solar beam.
    Eoscoe has prosecuted the photo-chemical investigations which Bunsen and he

 began some years ago. For altitudes above 10 degrees, the relation between the
 sun's altitude aud the chemical intensity of light is represented by a straight line.

 Till the sun has reached an altitude of about 20 degrees, the chemical action pro-
 duced by diffused daylight exceeds that of the direct sunlio-ht ; the two actions
 are then balanced ; and at higher elevations the direct sunlight is superior to the
 diffused light. The supposed inferiority of the chemical action of liglit under a
 tropical sun to its action in higher latitudes proves to be a mistake. According to

 lloscoe and Thorpe, the chemical intensity of light at Para under the equator in

the month of April is more than three times greater than at Kew in the month of

 August.
    Hunter has given a great extension to the earlier experiments of Saussure on the

 absorptive power of charcoal for gases. Cocoanut-charcoal, according to Hunter's
 experiments, exceeds all other Tarieties of wood-charcoal in absorptive power,
 taking up at ordinary pressures 170 volumes of ammonia and 69 of carbonic acid.
 Methylic alcohol is more largely absorbed than any other vapour at temperatures
 from 90° to 127° ; but at 159° the absorption of ordinary alcohol exceeds it.
 Cocoanut-charcoal absorbs forty-four times its volume of the vapour of water at

 127°. The absorptive power is increased by pressure.
    Last year two new processes for improving the manufacture of chlorine attracted

 the attention of the Section : one of these has already proved to be a success ; and

 I am glad to be able to state that Mr. Deacon has recently overcome certain diffi-

 culties in his method, and has obtained a complete absorption of the chlorine.

atmosplieric air ? "With baryta the problem can be solved veiy perfectly, if not

economically. Another process is that of Tessier de Mothay, in which the man-

ganate of potassium is decomposed by a current of superheated steam, and after-

Awards revived by being heated in a current of air.                                                              company has lately been

formed in New York to apply this process to the production of a brilliant house-

Alight.    compound Argaud burner is used, having a double row of apertures ; the

inner row is supplied with oxj'gen, the outer with coal-gas or other combustible.

The applications of pure oxygen, if it could be prepared cheaply, woidd be very

numerous                                                  and  few discoveries would inore                       amply reward  the inventor.          Among
                                                       ;

other uses it might be applied to the production of ozone free from nitric acid by

the action of the electiical discharge, and to the introduction of that singular body,

in an efficient form, into the arts as a bleaching and oxidizing agent. Tessier de
Mothay has also proposed to prepare hydrogen gas on the large scale by heating

hydrate of lime with anthracite.

  We learn from the history of metallurgy that the valuable alloy which copper

forms vnth zinc was known and applied long before zinc itself was discovered.
Nearly the same remark may be made at present with regard to manganese and its

alloys. The metal is difficult to obtain, and has not in the pure state been applied

to any useful purpose                                                                                   but its  alloys with copper and other metals  have been pre-
                                                                                                     ;

pared, and some of them are likely to be of gi-eat value. The alloy with zinc and

copper is used as a substitute for german silver, and possesses some advantages
over it. Not less important is the alloy of iron and manganese prepared according

to the process of Henderson, by reducing in a Siemens's fm-nace a mixture of car-

bonate of manganese and oxide of iron. It contains from 20 to 30 per cent, of

manganese, and will doubtless replace to a large extent the spiegeleisen now used

in the manufacture of Bessemer steel.

The classical researches of Eoscoe have made us acquainted for the first time

with metallic vanadium. Berzelius obtained brilliant scales, which he supposed to
be the metal, by heating an oxychloride in ammonia ; but they have proved to be
a nitride. Roscoe prepared the nietal, by reducing its chloride in a current of

hydrogen, as a light grey powder, with a metallic lustre under the microscoi)e. It

has a remarkable affinity both for nitrogen and silicon. Like phosphorus, it is a

pentad, and the vanadates correspond in composition to the phosphates, but differ

in the order of stability at ordinary temperatures, the soluble tribasic salts being

less stable than the tetrabasic compounds.

Sainte-Claire DeviUe, in continuation of his researches on dissociation, has ex-

amined the conditions under which the vapom* of water is decomposed by metallic
iron. The iron, maintained at a constant temperature, but var^-ing in different

experiments from 150° C. to 1600° C, was exposed to the action of vapour of
water of known tension. It was found that for a given temperature the iron con-

tinued to oxidize, till the tension of the hydrogen formed reached an invariable

value. In these experiments, as Deville remarks, iron behaves as if it emitted a

vapour (hydrogen), obeying the laws of hygrometiy. An interesting set of expe-
riments has been made by Lothian BeU on the power possessed by spongy metallic

iron of splitting iip carbonic oxide into carbon and carbonic acid, the former being

Adeposited in the iron.                                                                                 minute quantity of oxide of iron is always formed in this

reaction.

The fine researches of Graham on the colloidal state have received an interesting

Aextension by Keynolds's discovery of a new group of colloid bodies.                                                                                  solution

of mercuric chloride is added to a mixture of -acetone and a dilute solution of

potassium hydrate till the precipitate which at first appears is redissolved, and the

clear liquid poured upon a dialyzer which floated upon water. The compo.sition

of the colloid body thus obtained in the anhydrous state was found to be

((0113)2 CO), Hg3 O3. The hydrate is regarded by Reynolds as a feeble acid, even

Amore readily decomposed than alkaline silicates.                                                                solution containing only five

per cent, forms a firm jelly when heated to 50° C. Analogous compounds were

formed with the higher members of the fatty ketone series. In the same direc-

tion are the researches of Marcet on blood, which he finds to be a strictly colloid

fluid containing a small proportion of diffusible salts.

In organic chemistry the labours of chemists have been of late largely directed
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                63

to a group of hydrocarbons whicli were first discovered among the products of the

destructire distiUation of coal or oil. The central body round which these

researches have chiefly turned is benzol, whose discovery will always be asso-

ciated with the name of Faraday. With this body naphthalin and anthracene form

a series, whose members difter by C^ H,, and their boiling-points by about 140°,

The recent researches of Liebermann have proved, as was before suspected, that

chrysene is a fourth member of the same series. I may add that ethylene, which

boils at about --70°, corresponds iu composition and boiling-point to a lower

member of the same series. Kekulti propounded some time ago with great

clearness the q[uestion as to whether the six atoms of hydrogen in benzol are

equivalent, or, on the contrary, play dissimilar parts. According to the first

hypothesis, there can be only one modification of the mono- and penta-derivatives

of benzol ; while three modifications of the bi-, tri-, and tetra-derivatives are

possible. On the second hypothesis, two modifications of the mono-derivatives

are possible, and in general a much larger number of isomeric compounds than on

the first hj'pothesis. Such is the problem which has of late occupied the attention

of some of the ablest chemists of Germany, and has led to a large number of new

and important investigations. The aromatic hydrocarbons, toluol, xylol, &c.,

which diSer from one another by CHj, have been shown by Fittig to be methyl

derivatives of benzol. According to the first of the two hypotheses to which I

have referred, only one benzol and one methyl benzol (toluol) are possible, and

accordingly no isomeric modifications of these bodies have been discovered. But

the three following members of the series ought each to be capable of existing in

three distinct isomeric forms. The researches of Fittig had already established

--the existence of two isomeric compounds having the formula C^ Hj,,, methyl-

toluol (obtained synthetically from toluol) and isoxylol (prepared by the removal

of an atom of methyl from the mesytelene of Kane). The same chemist has since

obtained the third modification, orthoxylol, by the decomposition of the paraxy-

lylic acid. These three isomeric hydrocarbons may be readily distinguished from

one another by the marked difterence in the properties of their trinitro-compounds,

and also by their diflerent behaviour with oxidizing agents. Other facts have been

adduced in support of the equality or homogeneity of position of the hydrogen

atoms in benzol. Thus Iliibner and Alsberg have prepared aniline, a mono-

derivative, from diflerent biderivatives, .and have always obtained the same body.

The latest researches on this subject are those of Richter.

Baeyer has prepared artificially picoline, a base isomeric with aniline, and dis-

covered by Anderson iu his verj^ able researches on the pyridine series. Of the

two methods described by Baeyer, one is founded on an experiment of Simpson, in
which a new base was obtained by heating tribromallyl with an alcoholic solution

of ammonia. By pushing further the action of the heat, Baeyer succeeded in

expelling the whole of the bromine from Simpson's base in the form of hydro-

bromic acid, and in obtaining picoline. The same chemist has also prepared

artificially collidine, another base of the pyridine series. To this list of remark-

able synthetical discoveries, another of the highest interest has lately been added
-- Heby Schifl" the preparation of artificial confine.
                                                        obtained it by the action of

ammonia on butyric aldehyde (C4 H^ 0). The artificial base has the same com-

position as coniiue prepared from hemlock. It is a liquid of an amber-yellow

colour, having the characteristic odour and nearly all the usual reactions of ordi-

nary confine. Its physiological properties, so far as they have been examined,

agree with those of confine from hemlock ; but the artificial base has not yet been

obtained in large quantity, nor perfectly pure.

   Valuable papers on alizarine have been published by Perkin and Schunck. The
latter has described a new acid, the antliraflavic, which is formed in the artificial

preparation of alizarine. Madder contains another colouring principle, purpurine,

which, like alizarine, yields anthracene when acted on by reducing agents, and has

also been prepared artificially. These colouring principles may be distinguished

from one another, as Stokes has shown, by their absorotion bands ; and Perkin has

latel}' confirmed by this optical test the interesting observation of Schunck, that

finished madder prints contain nothing but pure alizarine in combination with

the mordant employed.
64 REPORT 1871.

Hofmann has achieved another triumph in a department of chemistry which he

has made peculiarly his own. In 1857 he showed that alcohol bases, analogous

to those derived from ammonia, could be obtained by replacement from phosphu-

retted hydrogen                                                                             but he foiled in his attempts to prepare the two lower derivatives.
                                                                                         ;

These missing links he has now supplied, and has thus established a complete

parallelism between the derivatives of ammonia and of phosphuretted hydrogen.

The same able chemist has lately described the aromatic cyanates, of which one

only, the phenylic cyauate (CO, Cg Hj, N), was previously known, having been

discovered about twenty years ago by Hofmann himself. He now prepares this

compound by the action of phosphoric anhydride on phenylurethane, and by a

similar method he has obtained the tolylic, xylylic, and uaphthylic cyanates.

Stenhouse had observed many years ago that when aniline "is added to furfurol

the mixture becomes rose-red, and comnmnicates a fugitive red stain to the skin,

and also to linen and silk. He has lately resumed the investigation of this subject,

and has obtained two new bases, furfuraniline and furfiu-toluidine, which, like

rosanUine, form beautifully coloured salts, altliough the bases themselves are

neai-ly colourless, or of a pale brown colour. The furfuraniline hydrochlorate

(Ci7 H,3 Oj No CI) is prepared by adding furfurol to an alcoholic solution of aniline

Wehydrochlorate containing an excess of aniline.                                            have also from Stenhouse

a new contribution to the history of orcin, in continuation of his former masterly

researches on that body. He has prepared the trinitroorcin (C.H^ (N02)3 0,), a
powerful acid, having many points of resemblance to picric acid. ^ In connexion

with another research of Stenhouse made many years ago, it is interesting to find

his formula for euxanthon, which was also that of Erdmann, confirmed by the

recent experiments of i>aeyer.

The interesting work of Dewar on the oxidation of picoline must not be passed

over without notice. By the action of the permanganate of potassium on that

body, he has obtained a new acid which bears the same relation to pyridine that

phthalic acid does to benzol. Thorpe and Young have published a'preliminary

notice of some results of great promise which they have obtained by exposing

paraflin to a high temperature in closed vessels. By this treatment it is almost

completely resolved into liquid hydrocarbons, whose boiling-points range from

18° C. to 300° C. Those boiling under 100' have been examined, and consist

chiefly of olefines. In connexion with this subject, it may be interesting to recall

the experiments of Pelouze and Cahours on the Pennsylvanian oils, which proved

to be a mixture of carbohydrogens belonging to the marsh-gas series.

  An elaborate exposition of Berthelot's method of transforming an organic

compound into a hydrocarbon containing a maximum of hydrogen has appeared in

a connected form. The organic body is heated in a sealed tube, with a large excess

of a strong Solution of hydriodic acid, to the temperature of 275°. The pressure in

these experiments Berthelot estimates at 100 atmospheres, but apparently without

having made any direct measm'ements. He has thus prepared ethyl hydride

(C^Hg) from alcohol, aldehyde, &c., hexyl hydride (C^ U^i) from benzol. Berthelot

has submitted both wood-charcoal and coal to the reducing action of hydriodic

acid, and among other interesting results he claims to have obtained in this way

oil of petroleum.

By the action of chloride of zinc upon codeia, Matthiessen and Buraside have

obtained apocodeia, which stands to codeia in the same relation as apomorphia to

morphia, an atom of water being abstracted in its formation. Apocodeia is more

stable than apomorphia, but the action of reagents upon the two bases is -s'ery
similar. As regards their physiological action, the hydrochlorate of apocodeia is a

mild emetic, while that of apomorphia is an emetic of gi-eat activity. Other bases

have been obtained by ^^^right by the action of hydrobromic acid on codeia. In

two of these bases, bromotetracodeia and chlorotetracodeia, four molecules of the

codeia are welded together, so that they contain no less than seventy-two atoms of

carbon. They have a bitter taste, but'little physiological action. The authors of

these valuable researches were indebted to Messrs. Macfarlane for the precious

material upon which they operated.

  We are indebted to Crum Brown and Fraser for an important work on a subject

of great practical as well as theoretical interest,--the relation between chemical
                                                                                  ;

constitution and physiological action. It has long been Imown that the ferro-

cyanide of {potassium does not act as a poison on the animal system, and Bunsen

has shown that the kakodylic acid, an arsenical compound, is also inert. Crum
Brown and Eraser find that the methyl compounds of strychnia, brucia, and thebaia

are much less active poisons than the alkaloids themselves, and the character of

their physiological action is also different. The hypnotic action of the sulphate

of methyl-morphium is less than that of morphia ; but a reverse result occui's in the

case of atropia, whose methyl and ethyl derivatives are much more poisonous than

the salts of atropia itself.

Before proceeding to the subject of fermentation, I may refer to Apjohn's

chemico-optical method of separating cane-sugar, inverted sugar, and grape-sugar

from one another when present in the same solution, by obser\ing the rotative

power of the syrup before and after inversion, and combining the indications of

the saccharometer with the results of an analysis of the same S3'rup after inversion.

Heisch's test for sewage in ordinary water is also deserving of'notice. It consists

in adding a few grains of pure sugar to the water, and exposing it fi-eely to light

for some hom-s, when the liquid will become turbid from the formation of a well-

marked frmgus if sewage to the smallest amount be present. Frankland has made

the important observation that the development of this fungus depends upon the

presence of the phosphate, and that if this condition be secured, the fungus will

appear even in the pm-est water.

The nature of fermentation, and in particular of the alcoholic fennentation, haa

been lately discussed by Liebigwith consummate ability, and his elaborate memoir

will well repaj'- a careful perusal. Dr. Williamson has also given a most instructive

account of the subject, particularly with reference to the researches of Pasteur, in
Ahis recent Cantor lectures.
                                  brief statement of the present position of the

question will therefore not be out of place here. It is now thirty-four years since
Cao;niard de La Tour and Schwann proved by independent observations that yeast-

globules are organized bodies capable of reproduction by gemmation ; and also

inferred as highly probable that the phenomena of fermentation are induced by the

development or living action of these globules. These views, after having fallen

into abeyance, were revived and extended a few years ago by Pasteur, whose able

researches are familiar to every chemist. Pasteur, while acknowledging that he
was ignorant of the nature of the chemical act, or of the intimate cause of the

splitting up of sugar in the alcoholic fermentation, maintained that all fermenta-

tionsproperly so called are coiTelative with physiological phenomena. Accordino-

to Liebig, the development and multiplication of the yeast-plant or fungus is
dependent upon the presence and absorption of nutriment, which becomes part of

the living organism, while in the process of fermentation an external action takes

place upon the substance, and causes it to split up into products which cannot be
made use of by the plant. The vital process and the chemical action, he asserts,

are two phenomena which in the explanation must be kept separate from one
another. The action of a ferment upon a fermentable body he compares to the

action of heat upon organic molecules, both of which cause a movement in the

internal an-augement of the atoms. The phenomena of fermentation Liebio- refers

--now, as formerly, to a chemico-physical cause, the action, namely, which a sub-

stance in a state of molecular movement exercises upon another of highly complex

constitution, whose elements are held together by a feeble affinity, and are to some

extent in a state of tension or strain. Baeyer, who considers that in the alcoholic

and lactic fermentations one part of the compound is reduced and another oxidized,

adopts the view of Liebig, that the molecules of sugar which undergo fermentation

do not serve for the nourishment of the yeast-plant, but receive an impulse from it.

All are, however, agreed that fermentation is arrested by the death of the plant

and even a tendency to the acetous fermentation in wine may be cliecked, as

Pasteur has shown, by heating the wine to a temperature a little below the boiling-

point in the vessel in which it is afterwards to be kept.

   I regret that the limits of an address like the present forbid me to pursue
further this analysis of chemical work. Had they admitted of abridgment,

I should gladly have described the elaborate experiments of Gore on hydrofluoric

acid and the fluoride of silver. The important researches of Abel on explosive

Section some observations on catharism and nuclei, a difficult subject, to which he

  No one can be more painfully alive than myself to the serious omissions in the
historical review I have now read, more particulai'ly in organic chemistiy, where

it was wholly impossible to grapple with the large number of valuable works

which even a few months produce. I cannot, however, refrain from bearing an

humble tribute to the great abilitj' and indomitable perseverance which characterize

the labourers in the gi'eat field of organic chemistry. It woidd scarcely be pos-

sible to conceive any work more intelligeutly undertaken or more conscientiously
performed than theirs, yet much of it, from its abstruse character, receiving little

sympathy or encouragement except from the band of devoted men who have made

this subject the chief piu^suit of theii* lives. They will, however, find their reward

in the consciousness that they have not lived in vain, but have been engaged, and

successftdly engaged, in the noble enterprise of extending for the benefit of the

human family the boundaries of scientific knowledge. Nor is there any real

gi-ound for discouragement. Faraday, Graham, Magnus, and Herschel, who have

left their impress on this age, were all distinguished chemical as well as physical

discoverers                                                      and the relations of  the sciences are becoming every day so  intimate
                                                              ;

that the most special research leads often to results of wide and general interest.

No one felt this truth more clearly or illustrated it better in his writings than our

lamented and distinguished friend Dr. Miller, whose presence used to cheer our

meetings, and whose loss we all most sincerely deplore.

On the Dichroism of the Vapour of Iodine. By Dr. An'deews, F.R.S.

The fine purple colom' of the vapour of iodine arises from its transmitting freely

the red and blue rays of the spectrum, while it absorbs nearly the whole of the

green rays. The transmitted light passes freely through a red copper or a blue

cobalt glass. But if the iodine vapour be sufiiciently dense, the whole of the red rays

are absorbed, and the transmitted rays are of a pure blue coloiu: ; they are now

freely transmitted, as before, by the cobalt glass, but will not pass through the red
Aglass.
         solution of iodine in sulphide of carbon exhibits a similar dichroism, and

according to its density appears either pm-ple or blue when white light is trans-

mitted through it. The alcoholic solution, on the contrary, is of a red colour, and

does not exhibit any dichroism.

         On the Action of Heat on Bromine. By Dr. Andrews, F.B.S.

rature is above the critical point, the whole of the bromine becomes quite opaque,

measure of the change of power of transmitting light in this case may be obtained
by varying the proportion of liquid and vapour in the tube. Even liquid bromine
transmits much less light wheu heated strongly in an hermetically sealed tube than

in its ordinary state,

 On the Examination of Water for Sanitary purposes. By Gustat Bischof.

   The principle of the method consists in evaporating 1 cub. centim. of the ^vater
to he examined in a cell formed by cementing a glass ring on a slip of plate glass,

such as used for mounting microscopic objects. By means of certain appliances

dust is effectually excluded during the evaporation. The temperatm-e at which
the samples are evaporated (40° to 45° C.) is regulated by a Kemp-Bimsen gas-
regulator improved for the puiijose by the author.

   If pure water, such as we find naturally, be evaporated, one observes imder the

microscope in the residue essentially colomiess, or nearly colom-less, dendi-itic,
branching, tree-like, and well-detined hexagonal and rhombohedi-al crystals of
calcium carbonate. In the case of natural impure water, or if pui'e water be
contaminated by adding minute quantities of either sewage or urine, the above
crystals are no longer perceptible, and, according to the degi-ee of impurity, their
place is taken by more or less imperfectly defined yeUowish-brown or red hexagonal
or rhombohedral crystals of calcium carbonate, or by hexagonal twin-crystals, or
triangles with rounded angles, or, finally, drops of fat and the so-called dumb-bella

(which latter are either fatty matter or germs of fungi) make their appearance.
 _ If the presence of germs of fungi be doubtful, they are determined by cultiva-
ting tlie residue in a damp chamber for some forty-eight hours before'it is quite
evaporated to dryness. Several well-definable species of fungi have thus been

produced.

   The results of the examination of a number of samples, illustrated by several

     _

lithographed plates, proved that one-thousandth part of sewage or mine added to
pure water so completely altered the appearance of the residue as to lead to the
conclusion that still more minute quantities of the above impmities can also be
detected in water by this method.

   On the other hand, the residue of sewage which had been filtered through

spongy ii-on (the process to which the author called attention at the last Meeting
of the Association) exhibited throughout the characteristics of the purest water.
Professor Voelcker anived also, by chemical analysis, at the residt that the
sewage filtered through spongy iron was " remarkably free from organic matter,
containing less organic matter than many excellent drinking-waters," thus proving
that analysis and the microscopic examination come to the same conclusion.

   In concluding, some residues of natural waters exhibited in the plates referred
to above were explained as to their characteristics.

     On the Crystallization of Metals hy Electricity. By Philip Beaham.

   The author of this paper gave an accouut of experiments with electricity under

of the base, and crystals of several metals were formed. The author hopes by the
same means to obtain crystals of all.

   The apparatus for regulating the quantity and intensity of the electricity was
exhibited and explained.

   The author then drew attention to the shape of the crystals, and suggested that,
being built up of molecules^ they might be typical of their elementary forms,

                  On tSorlif. By Professor Delffs, of He'idelherg.

   Twenty years ago M. Pelouze (Ann. de Chim. et de Phys. 3 ser. xxxr. p. 222)
discovered a crj-stallized substance in the fruits of Sorhus aucuparia which he
called Sorbin. Since that time reiy few chemists have paid attention to this

substance, and, as far as I know, nobody in my country has succeeded in preparing

it again. The principal of one of our greatest manufactories of chemical prepara-

tions, to whom I addressed mj'self, told me that he never found the least trace of

the said substance, although he had worked up large quantities of the above-
mentioned fruits for preparing malic acid ; and to the same result came M. Byschl

(Buchner's N. Repert. der Pharm. iii. p. 4), who asserts that there is no ready
formed sorbin in the ripe benies of Sorbns aucuparia. In my two first attempts
to procure sorbin I also failed ; but dming last year I succeeded, and at the same

time I became aware of the reason of my previous failures. When I first tried to get

sorbin, I thought it advisable to combine the preparation of malic acid with the
process given by M. Pelouze for getting sorbin, and therefore I separated the
former by means of acetate of lead. This is the reason, I think, which has
prevented the success of mj'self as well as of other chemists in the preparation

of sorbin.

   I will not repeat the method of forming sorbin given in all manuals of chemistry
it is sufficient to say that, when I kept strictly to the prescription of M. Pelouze,
I got a large quantity of beautiful crystals, a specimen of which was contained
in the tube exhibited. After I had got these, I tried to obtain the malic acid
from the residue, but I found that the malic acid had quite disappeared. To this
I must add that the alcoholic fermentation which takes place after the juice of
the berries of Sorhus aucuparia has been left a few days in a tepid place is more easily
perceived by the formation of carbonic acid than by the smell of spirit of wine. I
think it, therefore, not improbable that there is a connexion between the disap-
pearance of the malic acid and the small produce of spirit of wine on the one
side, and the formation of sorbin on the other. Suppose the malic acid, com-

monly called hihasic, and therefore apt to form a bimalate of ethyl ( = C^H'04-

20* H^ 0*4-H0), assimilates two equivalents of water to this compound, you will

have then the equation

                          C*IF 0+20* B? 0'+3HO=0'2 IP' 0'^,

the right-hand side of which gives the composition of sorbin.

   As pertaining to the preparation of sorbin, I ha^e only to add that the dark
sticky ley in which the crystals are formed can very easily be separated by putting

both on a brick. After a few days' repose the brick has absorbed nearly all the
ley, and the pale yellow-coloured crystals of sorbin, if dissolved in water and left
to spontaneous evaporation, become very soon colourless.

    The sorbin belongs to the same gToup as the mannit, quercit, inosit, dul(;it, pi-
 crit, &c. ; and as the last syllable is always characteristic in chemistry, its name, I
 think, should bo changed into sorbit.

    Pui-ther experiments are required to prove if the supposed genesis of sorbit is

true or not; but, in any case, I am convinced that there is no sorbin ready formed

 in the fruits of Sorbns aucuparia.

         On the Detection of Morj^hine hy Iodic Acid. By Prof. Delffs.
   Among the poisonous alkaloids which in forensic cases most frequently give

 occasion for chemical investigations morphine occupies the first place. For its

detection a great many tests liare lieen proposed, most of which, however, have

little interest for the forensic chemist, particularly as they depend on phenomena

which may also he produced hy other substances beside morphine. It is not in-

tended here to justify this assertion by a critical examination of all the tests for

morphine which are liable to the reproach mentioned; it will he sufficient to

signalize one of them, the iodic acid, as an example. The well-known property of

this acid, of being reduced by morphine, is certainly adapted to distinguish the

latter from other alkaloids, but is altogether insufficient to establish the nature of

morphine, because there are a great many other substances, partly of organic, partly

of inorganic origin, which likewise reduce iodic acid. Nevertheless I have foimd

that iodic acid, with the aid of the microscope, presents a sure means of charac-

terizing morphine perfectly, because the reaction between this alkaloid and the

above-mentioned test proceeds under such peculiar appearances that morphine

cannot be mistaken for any other substance. The process to be adopted for this

purpose is the following:

After the morphine (of which the smallest particle is sufficient) is placed on a

slip of glass and covered with a glass cover, as much water is added as will fill the

space between the slip and the cover and extend a little beyond the margin of the

latter. After the glass slip is put under the microscope and this is directed to the

morphine, a particle of iodic acid is put into the water at the margin of the covering

glass. In a few moments a great number of minute spherical yellow molecules, of

constantly equal diameter, are seen to move in a direction from the iodic acid to

the sides of the morphine, and soon form in its vicinity numerous colourless needle-

shaped crystals, mostly united so as to form tufts. For the observation of this

microscopic metamorphosis a magnifying-power of 300 linear would be the most

suitable                                       when a more powerfid system of lenses is employed, the difference  of the
                                            ;

focal distances of the morphine and the above-mentioned, molecules and crystals

readily becomes too great for the distinct observation of the whole simidtaneously.

Hence it is also advantageous to place under the covering glass the thinnest possible

fragment of morphine.

I reserve for another place a more detailed communication on this subject.

The authors had recently communicated a paper to the Royal Society in which

they investigated somewhat minutely what takes place when a plate of one metal,

such as copper, is immersed in a solution of a salt of another metal, such as nitrate

of silver. They had shown that, while the silver was being deposited on the copper,

an actual passage of the nitric element towards the more positive metal occurs,

causing the formation of a dense solution of nitrate of copper inside the crystalline

deposit, and a consequent downward current, and at the same time an upward

cm-rent of almost pure water fi'om the tips of the crystals. They had shown, also,

that with solutions of different strengths the chemical action in a given period

(say ten minutes) is not in direct proportion to   the  strength                                          but, creteris 2J(tribiis,

twice the strength gives thi-ee times the chemical decomposition. This augmenta-

tion had been attributed to an increased conduction of the stronger liquid. In the

present paper the authors exhibited these phenomena in a dissected form, and

carried the observations still further.

Instead of the silver crystals being allowed to grow from the copper into the

nitrate-of-silver solution, two separate plates were taken, one of copper and the

other of silver. The copper plate was immersed in nitrate of copper, and the silver

plate in nitrate of silver, while the two metals were connected by a wire, and the

two liquids were connected by a porous cell. Silver ciystals were gradually formed

upon the silver plate, while the copper was dissolved ; and at the end of some

hours it was found that all the silver had been removed from solution, and that

the loss of the copper plate was almost exactly what might be calculated from

--the amount of nitrate of silver originally placed in the other cell. The actual

numbers were theoretical 0'412, actual 0-402. The copper nitrate was formed in

the cell -witli the copper plate, the specific gi-avity of the liquid having risen from

1-015 to 1-047.

  A similar experiment was tried with plates of copper and zinc in sulphate of

copper and sulphate of zinc respectively. The result was as before, metaUic copper

being deposited on the copper plate, and the sulphate of zinc rising in specific

gravity from l-12:j to 1-189.
   In order to determine whether the amount of silver deposited depended, not

merely on the amoimt of the silver in solution, but also on the amount of copper
salt that bridged over the intervening space, similar experiments were made in
which the nitrate of silver was kept constant, but the nitrate of copper was increased
by equivalent multiples. It was foimd that the silver deposited increased -with the
increase of the cojjper salt, being about double when the copper salt was seven
times as strong, and that the effect of successive additions gi-adually diminished.
This is in strict accordance with other experiments, showing that, when the copper
plate is immersed in a mixture of the nitrates of copper and silver, the amount of
silver deposited is iucreased, and increases with each successive addition of copper

salt, though in a diminishing ratio.
   That this acceleration is not produced by a copper salt only was proved by re-

peating the experiment with a variety of other nitrates.
   The subjoined Table shows the results, and indicates, at the same time, that the

increased effect does not depend simply upon the nitric element, which was present

in the same quantity in all, but likewise on the nature of the salt.

                       A'ote on Fibrin. By Dr. John GoodmajST.

    The author having read a paper on the above subject at the Meeting of the

 Association in Liverpool last yeai-, has been since tliat period constantly engaged

 in a long series of experiments establishing the truth of the statements there set

 forth. The following is an epitome of the results obtained. The experiments
 were performed under the microscope :

    1. Albumen immersed for some short time in cold water loses its characters as
 albumen, and becomes transformed into a substance which the author asserts

 exactl}' resembles blood-fibrin under the microscope.
     2. This substance exhibits intense attractive powers.
    3. It decomposes peroxide of hj-drogcn with effervescence. According to the

 author's views, all these experiments showed that water is the primary source of

 this change, and that until albumen is in some way subjected to the influence of

 water, oxygen can exert no influence in producing this change.
    4. The rapidity or intensity of the transformation was not increased by raisijig

 the temperature of the water.

    5. Ovalbumen does not />c?- se become transformed into fibrin by the ^"oltaic
 cuiTcnts, only to such an extent as its water of fluidity is available for this pur-

 pose.

    6. But when diluted witli water the entire mass of albumen submitted to the
cuiTent was rapidly transformed into fibrin.

   7. When this .substance was submitted to potash it dissolved in three minutes,

whilst blood-fibrin required twelve hours and ovalbumen twenty-four hours for

 solution.

    8. In strong hydrochloric acid both this substance and blood-fibrin dissolved in
twenty-four hours, whilst ovalbumen was not completely dissolved in sixteen

 days.

    9. In all acid solutions of this substance, and of blood-fibrin precipitated by
alkalies, and of alkaline solutions precipitated by acids, tlie author asserts that he
invariably finds fibrinous rods and formations perfectly identical in their appear-
ance one withthe other, and without any coagulum peculiar to albuminous preci-
pitations; whilst on the other hand in similar solutions of albumen similarly pre-
cipitated, he finds as invariably a dense flocculent coagulum, without the presence
of fibrinous rods or other formations. AUraliue solutions, moreover, of albumen
precipitated by acetic acid gave always a dense white and flocculent coagulum,
and those precipitated by nitric acid gave a lemon-yellow precipitate, whilst
neither white nor lemou-yellow coagula occurred in similar precipitations from
like solutions of fibrin thus produced as blood-fibrin. The author maintains that
these experiments show that the substance thus produced by the agency of water
is genuine fibrin.

MdUdFreliminanj Notice on a New  of Testing Samples of Wood-NajiJitJia.

By William Haekness, F.B.M.S.

   The detection of wood-naphtha, when present in alcohol, is now comparatively

easy, but the converse problem, viz. the detection of alcohol in wood-naphtha, does
not seem to have occupied the attention of chemists generally.

   Methylated spirit, which is cheaper tlian wood-naphtha, is the only adulterant

likely to be used, and any simple mode of determining its presence must be of
some value to the chemist. One of the most common methods of examining a
sample of naphtha is to ascertain its boiling-point : but this is not reliable, as

difterent samples, even of the same specific gravity, may boil at different tempera-

tures, varj'mg from 1.38° F. to 156° F., and yet be free from ethylic alcohol.

engaged in the preparation of oxalate of methyl. It was noticed that different
samples of naphtha gave different quantities of this crystalline body. Further
investigations sliowed that the presence even of a small quantity of methylated
spirit or alcohol in the wood-naphtha from which the oxalate was prepared, altered
in the most striking manner the temperature at which solidification took place.
Thus, oxalate of methyl prepared from pure wood-naphtha is always solid at a
temperature exceeding 100^ F. This has been confirmed by experiments on all
kinds of naphtha, English and foreign.

   In samples containing methylated spirit or alcohol, ciystallization always takes
place at a temperature less than 100° F., such temperature depending on the per-

centage of alcohol present. The following are the averages of many experiments :

74 REPORT 1871.

                                                                 On the Aluminovs Iron-ores of Co. Antrim.
                                                                    By Dr. J. Sinclair Hoiden, of Lame.

    These ores have only been discoTered within the last few years, and exhibit a

seam both extensive and rich. It lies continuously for about seventy miles along

the coast and mouutaiji-glens of Antrim, being nearly horizontally interspread
throughout the basaltic rocks which form the floor of the county, and at an average

height of 300 feet above the white limestone.

    The elevation above sea-level varies considerably, as among the highest moun-

tains it is found at a height of over 1000 feet, from which it gradually falls north
and south as low as 200 feet. The general dip of the beds is south-west.

   Dr. riolden gave analyses of the ore, and adds that it is not analogous to any
known iron deposit in England, and that basaltic rocks, though containing some

iron in their composition, are not generally associated with large deposits of iron-
ore. The ferruginous stratum consists of three c[ualities of ore, which, in descend-

ing order, are :                                                                   ·.

These graduate into each other. The upper bed, or pisolite, is the richest in iron,
and working quantities can be mined containing from 30 to 50 per cent, of metallic

iron.

   Large quantities of this ore have now been raised and shipped to England,
where it has already made a reputation for itself, i?i facilitating the production of
pm'e iron from the siliceous haematites. The entire absence of phosphorus and
sulphur, and the presence of a large percentage of alumina, add much to its value,

both as an iron-ore and a flux,

   When intermixed with the siliceous ores in the smelting-furnace, the effect is to

soften the slag, producing a " loose load," which allows the metal to pass through
easily, forming a pure " pig," and, from a given quantity of the mixed ores, deter-
mining a higher percentage of metallic iron than could be otherwise obtained.

   It is chiefly used in Lancashire, Cumberland, and South Wales, and is becom-
ing a necessity where good steel-iron is demanded. To show that an extensive

source of industry has already been developed, it may be stated that upwards of
50,000 tons were exported last year, and the quantity will be much greater this

year.

   The discovery of this ore has had the effect of stimulating mineral research in
the adjoining counties, and Dr. Holden states not in vain, as samples of a good
siliceous hsematite have been shown him, and only wait exploration where they
were discovered. If found in quantity, no better outlay of capital could be iir-
vested than in the erection of smelting-furnaces on the Antrim coast.

   As suggested by the President of the Section, there could be utilized in the

local smelting of the ores the large quantity of peat available in the north of

Ireland.

    Loealities of Dioptase. Bij Professor N. Story Maskeltne, F.R.S.

    Dioptase has hitherto only been known as a product of the copper-mine at Altyn

Tubeh, in the Kirghese steppes of Tartary, if we except certain reputed localities

  A mineral recently found in Cornwall, and sent to the British Museum by Mr.

Tailing, may perhaps be referred to this group. It has been analyzed in the
Museum Laboratory, and Professor Maskelyne named it Andrewsite, in honour of

the distinguished President of the Chemical Section of the British Association,

Dr. Andrews, of Belfast.

   Andrewsite occurs in occasional association vtdth a bright green mineral in
brilliant minute crystals, presenting a strongly marked resemblance to those of

Dufrenite. This green mineral not ha'^dng been as yet, from the small amount

obtained of it, submitted to an analysis, is only provisionally termed Dufrenite.

The Andrewsite which it sometimes thus accompanies presents itself in globular

forms or in disks with a radiate structure, and in habit cmiously resembles Wavel-

lite.  Its colour is a slightly bluish  green                         its svirface is  generally formed of  a very
                                                                   ;

thin layer of the mineral provisionally termed Dufrenite, crystals of which occa-

sionally stand out of the globules.

The interior of the globules is sometimes homogeneous, and consists of radiating

crystalline fibres ; oftener one perceives an almost sudden transition from an outer
shell of some thickness, which consists of Andrewsite, into an inner core, formed

of a brown mineral.

Seen imder the microscope, the two minerals appear to a certain degree to inter-

peneti-ate each other, so that the selection of material for analysis is a work of
much caution.

The spherules usually stand on the projections of a quartzose veinstone, protruding

into a hoUow, and covered with a mass of limonite, sometimes carrying a drusy

crust of Gotliite, and studded occasionally with a few brilliant little crystals of
cuprite. The spherules are met with in one or two cases on cuprite formed round
a nucleus of native copper. Andrewsite, in fact, contains copper, four analyses of

separate specimens giving the percentages of 10-651, 10-702, 10-917, and 11-002.

  The parallelism of Clienevixite (Cuj As^O.+Fe^Hc OJ witli a portion of the

above formula is worthy of attention, and may justify the formula being written as

  A larger supply of the mineral will no doubt soon be forthcoming, when the

formula may be fixed on the foiindation of more certain analyses. The specific

gravity of this mineral is 3'47o, that of Dufrenite being (from Siegen) 3-2 to 3-4.

   The chalkosiderite of Ullmann, the name by which, nearly sixty years ago, he

designated a tliin crystalline coating overlying the radiated variety of the
Griineisenstein (Dufrenite) of the Hollerter Zug, Sayn, "Westphalia, does not

seem to have been analyzed by him. He states that it contains copper ; but the

subsequent analyses of Griineisenstein do not appear to confirm this statement
indeed it appears more nearly to resemble the green crystallized mineral which
has iu this note been provisionally described as Dufrenite.

                   On Ozonometnj. By T. Moffat, M.D., F.G.S.

   The author stated that ozone test-papers did not become permanently colom'ed in
the neighbourhood of cesspools, and that the brown colour, when formed, is

removed by the products of putrefaction. He also stated that light, the humidity

of the atmosphere, and direction of the wind influence the colouring of the test-
paper. Moisture with heat accelerates the chemical action, while a strong wind
causes a greater amount of ozone to impinge upon the test-paper in a given time.
To counteract the effect of these, he recommends that the test-paper be placed as

far as possible from cesspools, and that it be kept in a box. He next described a

tube-ozonometer which he had in use, and gave results obtained by an aspirator
ozonometer, and concluded by stating that the results obtained by the latter instru-
ment were not satisfactory.

   Rogianic acid is one of several new substances which I have obtained at various

times during the last few years from the fruit of Jut/Ians rcgia and another species
of wahiut. The green husk of the walnut cedes to benzol a yellowish substance,
which crystallizes, apparently in very elongated octahedra or feather-like gi'oups
of prisms. This substance, which I term ref/ianine, is easily decomposed, and
Avheu treated with alkalies or ammonia, yields splendid red-purple solutions,
whence acids precipitate a brown flocculent substance (impure regianic acid). The
latter, redissolved in a wealc solution of soda, precipitated again with hydro-
chloric acid, and washed with boiling water, forms a jet-black amoi-phous powder of
great density, which is pure regianic acid. It yields to analysis the composition

                                                    0"= H» 0^,

and forms a brown lead-salt, PbO, C^ H" 0^, also a jet-black silver-salt, very simi-

lar in appearance to the acid itself, and vAi\\ lime a beautiful pink-coloured salt,
which is precipitated by boiling its solutions with a little ammonia.

    Regianic acid is insoluble in water, but dissolves in alkalies with a beautiful red-
purple tint, that has no particular action upon the spectrum. It appears to be
derived from regianine by oxidation, for I extracted all the oxygen from a volume
of air by placing iu it a little regianine and soda.

We are also acquainted with analogous reactions which have been obtained with

amides and aldehydes of the aromatic series ; it therefore appeared to be a matter
of some interest to examine the action of aldehyde on another class of ammonia de-

--rivatives, the group of so-called ureas. Of these, there are at least two primary

bodies one the well-known product of the animal organism, or Wohler's beau-

tiful artificial m-ea ; and the other, the sulpho-urea, which was discovered a few

years ago by the author.

It is unnecessary now to discuss the question of the identity or otherwise of

Wohler's and the normal urea                                                                                                                   it is sufficient here to mention that all these experi-

inents have been made on Wohler's urea and on the analogous sulphur compound.

It will be convenient for the present to regard the two ureas just referred to as

ammonia derivatives respectively of cai'bonic (according to Dr. Kolbe carbamic)

and sulpho-carbonic acids ; thus

Action of Aldehyde on the SidpJio- Urea.

AThe first experiments were made with the sulpho-urea.                                                                                                        quantity of the pure

compound was dissolved to saturation in nearly anhydrous aldehyde. The hot

saturated solution was digested in a hermetically sealed flask, at a temperature of

100° C, for two hours. The solution was then allowed to cool. No urea-crystals

were deposited. After two days' standing, however, a number of minute, spheri-

cal, subcrystalline masses were found to have attached themselves to the sides of

the flask, and these gi-adually increased in quantity, until a considerable amount
had been obtained. The clear liquid gave a copious white precipitate with water
and with alcohol. The deposited body was carefully washed with cold alcohol,

in which it is very slightly soluble, and then purified by solution in a large vo-

lume of boiling anhydrous alcohol, from which the new body separates out to a

large extent on cooling, as a somewhat starch-like gi-anular substance, seen under
the microscope to be made up of extremely minute crystals. The analysis of the
body gave numbers agreeing well with the formula

and is therefore derived from the urea by the replacement of half the hydrogen
by ethjdiden.

 ' The new body is but slightly soluble in ether, rather more so in cold alcohol,
but its solubility in boihng alcohol is much greater. In consequence of its rela-

tions to these solvents, the substance can be easily purified. It is but very slio-htly,

   The urea was dissolved nearly to saturation in aldehyde, and the solution di-

gested in a sealed flask for two hours at 100" C. When cool, the flask was opened,

and the contents poured into a suitable vessel, and the aldehyde slowly evaporated.

No crystals of the urea were deposited, but a transparent pasty mass remained
when the solvent had been almost wholly driven off! After standing for twenty-four

hours, the residue was found to be white and friable. The mass was powdered,
and digested in the cold with nearly anhydi-ous alcohol, in which it is very slightly
soluble at ordinaiy temperature, washed with the same liquid, and then boiled
with alcohol. The filtered solution so obtained deposits, on rapid cooling, a con-

siderable quantity of a flocculent body, seen under the microscope to be wholly

The new substance is easily decomposed by digestion with water into aldehyde

and the products of decomposition of the urea. The first stage of the reaction

may, no doubt, be represented by the equation

CO{S&f^"} +H.O = CO {Ng^}+C,H/0.

   Having succeeded in replacing half the hydi-ogen in each of these ureas, di-
rectly and by a very simple reaction, the author endeavoured to go a step further,
and substitute a hydrocarbon gi-oup for the residual hydrogen within the molecule.
All attempts in this direction have hitherto been fi'uitless.

   In view of the facts above stated and others well known, proving that half the
hydrogen only is capable of replacement, and that each atom of nitrogen within

the molecule of the urea is somewhat differently engaged, we are clearly warranted

in slightly modifying the rational formula of each urea, in order to bring it into
more complete harmony with the facts. The extent of the alteration is apparent

when we write the formula of the ethyliden ureas referred to in this note, thus :

So far as the author Imows, the glycolic alcohol, which is the parent molecule

of this family gi'oup, has not yet been obtained in a state of isolation. The ethy-

len-glycol might at first sight be taken for the missing alcohol, more particularly

when we couple the decidedly biatomic character of their respective molecules

with the other, and even more significant fact, that the whole of the glycolic he-

terologues may be produced by the simple oxidation of the ethylen-glycol. Never-

theless, and notwithstanding these striking points of resemblance, the author is in-

clined to believe that these two alcohols are only isomeric ; and he gi'ounds this be-

lief upon the occurrence of a certain class of chemical compounds, among which

the so-called diethyl -acetal is the most conspicuous and best investigated member.

This diethyl-acetal is sti-ictly isomeric with the diethyl-ether of the ethylen-

--Ethylen-glycol differs from glycolic alcohol in two essential points : First, in

the former compoimd the two alcoholic constituents are represented as playing

produced from the primary alcohol by the simple abstraction of two molecules ox

family group of the heterologues of tlie fatty alcohols, seems, from its want of
stability, very proue to merge into the isomeric and far more permanent modifica-
tion of the glycolite of water. In this remarkable metamorphosis the double
carbon adjunct of the principal water-base becomes first of all converted into an
acid twin carbon-nucleus, which reunites under this new form with the old water-
base, whereupon, under the combined influence of base and acid, the remaining
water-molecule becomes decomposed, so as to surrender its oxygen to the envelope
of the acid twin carbon-nucleus, while the hydrogen connects itself with the same
nucleus under the tj-pical form of a hydrocarbon adjunct. It is worthy of note
that in this singular and characteristic rean-angemeut of the constituent elements
the organic molecule has, without loss of substance and without loss of satu-
rating capacity, passed at one bound from the categorj' of a true and genuine al-
cohol into the categorj' of a true and genuine water- salt. As regards the two
remaining heterologues of glycolate of water and oxyglycolate of water, you can-
not but see that their formation is due to the successive absoi-ption of two mole-
cules of oxygen by the envelope of the glycolous acid constituent, and that they
differ from each other in this respect only, that the former contains for its prin-
cipal constituent formate of watei", while the latter contains instead of it oxy-
formate of water. This oxyformate is a highly interesting isomeric modification
of the neutral carbonate of water, which, on account of its excessive want of
stability, cannot be obtained in a state of isolation. The compound before us
differs from the isomeric neutral carbonate in being decidedly monobasic, while
the latter is as decidedly bibasic. The cause of this apparent anomaly becomes

now fully revealed ; for it is plain that one of the two hydrogen-molecules, which

in the ordinary carbonate of water are both of them readily displaceable by metals,
has assumed the hydrocarbon form of gi-ouping, in consequence of which it will

cease to play the part of a basic nucleus ; and although it may become eliminated

or exchanged in obedience to other modes of substitution, it is certain that the
ordinary process of double decomposition has no control over it.

The Molecular arrangement of the Alloy of Silver and Copiier employed for

  the British Silver Coinage. By William Chandler Robeets, Chemist of

the Mint.

Experiments have demonstrated that when a molten alloy of silver and copper

is allowed to cool, the composition of the resulting metal is not uniform, the cooling

being attended with a remarkable molecular rearrangement, in virtue of which

certain constituents of the molten alloy become segregated from the mass, the homo-

geneous character of which is thereby destroyed.

Thus, to take an extreme case, an alloy containing 77'33 per cent, of silver and

A22'67 per cent, of copper was cast in a cubical mould of 42 millimetres.  portion

cut from the centre of the mass gave on assay 78-318 per cent, of silver, while a

portion cut from one of the angles was found to contain only 77"01o per cent, of

silver, showing a ditference of 13-03 milliemes.

Level proved that the alloy containing 71'89 per cent, of silver is homogeneous,

and in all alloys containing more silver than this amouut the centre of the soli-

dified mass is richer than the exterior ; on the other hand, in alloys of fineness lower

than 71 "89, the centre contains less silver than the external portions.

The alloy employed for the British silver coinage contains 92o parts of silver and

75 parts of copper in 1000 parts of alloy. The metals are melted together and cast

into bars 18 inches long and 1 inch thick ; these bars are subsequently rolled into

strips or ribands, and from these ribands the disks of metal to form the coins are

cut.

   Experiments conducted in the most careful manner proved that the centre of
the riband contained more silver by two parts in the thousand than the external
edges. The increase in richness from one edge of the riband to the centre, and
the coiTesponding decrease in riclmess from the centre to the opposite edge, was
extremely regular, as was shown by the curve or graphic representation of the
results by which the paper was illustrated.

                                      Improvements in Chlor'imetry

                By John Smyth, Jun., A.M., M.I.C.EJ., F.M.S.

   The author showed that the use of the milky solutiou of l)leachiDg--po'wder in
chlorimetry is unsatisfactoiy, aud was therefore giad to discover a method of securing
a clear solution containing all the chlorine by dissolving the sample in an alkaline
solution. This is conveniently done by adding, say, 10 grammes of bleaching-
powder to 20 grammes of soda-crj'stals (Naj OO3+IOH2O), filtering out the
precipitated carbonate of lime, which is known to be washed when it no longer
discharges the colour of dilute sulphate of indigo, and making up the filtrate by

water to one litre of fluid. It is a clear colourless liquid of the sp. gr. 1'007, but if

made of sp. gr. 1'233 it is slightly greenish, having a pleasant oily feeling between

the fingers, contrasting favourably with the roughness of the decanted solution of
the bleaching-powder, with which it gives a precipitate. Most satisfactory results
are obtained from it by all the chlorimetrical methods ; and it has the additional

advantage of showing the amount of lime in the sample, a solution of known

strength of carbonate of soda being added until a precipitate is no longer formed. It
is manufactured and used in the north of Ireland for bleaching fine linens ; and from
the ease and accuracy with, which the percentage of chlorine was obtained, the
author was led to investigate the feasibility of converting bleaching-powder into it
for chlorimetiical pm-poses, and obtained the above results.

                          By T. E. TnoEPE, Ph.B., F.R.S.E.

                        I. On the JReduction of Phosphoryl Trichloride.

   The author has attempted, but without success, to prepare the phosphorus
chlorides corresponding to the oxj'chlorides of vanadium discovered by Roscoe.

He found that when phosphorus oxychloride was heated -WTith metallic zinc in a

sealed tube to a temperature above the boiling-point of mercury, the phosphorus
trichloride (P CI,) was produced. It appears, therefore, that the action of zinc at
a high temperature on phosphoryl trichloride is sensibly different from the action
of this metal on the corresponding vanadium compound ; in the former case the
reaction is attended with abstraction of oxygen, in the latter with abstraction of

chlorine.

                    II. On the Preparation of PhosjjJiorus Sulphochloride.
   The author found that perfectly pure phosphorus sulphochloride may be easily
prepared by a reaction analogous to that by which phosphoryl trichloride has
long been obtained ; that is, by simply substituting P, S- for P2 0. according to the

P =following reaction, Po S,-t-.3 Ch PSt> CI3.

   The materials mixed in this proportion were heated in a sealed tube to about
150° C. ; in a few minutes combination was quietly effected, and the entire contents
of the tube were transformed into colomless phosphorus sulphochloride, a mobile

liquid boiling constantly at 12G° at 770 millims barom. Its' vapour is extremely

irritating, but when diluted with air it has an aromatic odour, reminding one of that

of the raspberry.

        On the Dissociation of Molecules by Heat,
       By C. E. C. TicHBOENE, F.C.S., M.IU.A.

   The term dissociation is applied by the author to specify a certain class of plic-
nomena somewhat distinct from ordinary decomposition. This latter term is

generally applied to any ease of molecular change which has been consummated,
whilst dissociation is used to convey a passive but present phenomenon. If this

latter is carried far enough, it ultimately results in a rupture, and thus the phe-
nomena of decomposition and dissociation are so intimately connected, that they
can hardly be investigated alone.

83 REPORT 1871.

Compound molecules exist in tte solid, liquid, and gaseous condition, providing

that the temperature necessary to convert tliem into these physical modifications

is not above the temperature at which their components are dissociated. Thus

Awe can easily conceive that a substance may be of sufficient structural stability

to pass through all the increasing vibratory action of heat without dissociation of

its component molecules, until it has passed through the solid, liquid, and far into
Bthe vaporous condition ; whilst a substance
                                              has what the author calls a

thermanalvtic point, or the point where the equilibrium is broken. If it lies

below 100'' C., we have dissociation in the liquid condition among compounds so-

luble in water.

  A well-kno-mi natural gi-oup of bases had been studied as regards these phe-

nomena, viz. the trioxides, alumina, chromic and ferric oxides, and it has been
found that all the compound molecules of these bases were more or less disso-

ciated on heating their solutions.
   The feiTic compounds are the most easily affected. The solutions of these

compounds, if pure, are almost colourless; the usual slight tinge being in most

cases produced by the ba.sic action of the water. By the cautious addition of
dilute acid, almost colom-less solutions will be procured. On the application of

heat this solution becomes gradually darker and darker, until it becomes a dark

reddish-brown fluid. If the water bears any considerable proportion to the salt,
a basic p-ecipitate falls before it has reached the boiling-point. The relative
amount of the water is of the utmost importance in these phenomena, because its
basic action lowers the thermanah-tic point. The result of the dissociative in-

fluence of heat when a precipitate' is not produced, is the repartitioning of the
elements by which a basic and an acid salt are produced in the same flmd simul-

taneously. If these experiments are carried on under pressure, or in the presence

of a great excess of water, the dissociative influence is so great from the increased

range of temperature, that anhydrous oxide of iron can be produced in the pre-

sence of water.

   The compounds of chromium are capable of dissociation in a similar manner,
and the change of colour produced by heat upon these solutions is due to basic

condition, and not to the state of hydration of the salt as generally stated.

   The aluminic molecules obey exactly the same rule ; i)ut as the thermanalytic
point is much higher, and as there is no chromatic change to niarlj the dissociative
influence of heat, it is difficult to discern the phenomenon. Under the influence
of solutions boiling at an increased pressure of 11 or 12 atmospheres alumina was
procm-ed. The same results may be obtained by increasing the basic condition of
the solution by a large volume of water. As the pressure raises the boiling-point

of the water until we reach the thermanalytic point of the molecule, so the basic

action of the water upon the stvlous grou'p lowers the thermanalytic point until

we get it within the range of 100=' C. If 500,000 to 600,000 times the weight of

water is used to the amount of salt, a precipitate is produced at lOO' C. This pre-
cipitate is best seeu by passing a beam of electric light through the flask. _ Most

of the precipitates niay be observed by the eye, but not all ; they redissolve

on coolin'go.'

On the hehMviow)' of Supersaturated Saline Solutions wlien exposed to the open

                         air. By Chaeles Tojilixsox, F.Il.S.

   It is known that when a vessel containing a supersaturated saline solution is

opened in a room, it immediately ciystallizes provided the temperature be not too
high. Mr. Tomlinson shows that supersaturated solutions of Glauber's salt (and

also of Epsom salts and of alum ) may be exposed to the open air of the country for
many hours, and even be taken out of the flasks in clean metal spoons, without
crystallizing. From a large number of experiments conducted under various con-

ditions, the follo\s-ing conclusions are drawn :

   1. That a highly supersaturated solution of sodic sulphate may be exposed

to the open air of the country in an imcovered flask, and in cloudy weather,
for from twelve to twenty hours, without any formation of the ordinary ten-

watered crystals,
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                     83

   2. That if tlie temperature fall to 40° Fahr. and under, tlie modified seven-
watered salt is formed at the bottom of the solution just as in covered vessels.

   3. That if the exposed solution suddenly crystallize into a compact mass of

needles, a nucleus may always be found in the form of an insect, a speck of soot, a

black point of carbon, &c.

   4. That if during the exposure rain come on, the solution generally crystallizes
suddenly in consequence of an active nucleus being brought down : but if the

flask be put out during heavy rain, when we may suppose all the solid nuclei to
be brought down, the rain-drops, now quite clean, fall into the solution without

any nuclear action.
   6. That the young and newly sprouted leaves of trees, such as those of the

gooseberry and currant, have no nuclear action.

   C. That in clear cloudless weather, when the force of evaporation is strong, the

solutions b}^ exposure produce fine groups of crystals of the ten-atom salt, j ust as a
saturated solution would do if left to evaporate slowly in an open dish.

   7. That if the solution, after being exposed to the open air, be brought into a room,

it crystallizes immediately under the action of aerial miclei.

On the Oxidation products of tlie Essential Oil of Oranye-peel, Jcnown as
  " Essence de Portugal.'" By C. R. A. "Wrigiit, D.Sc, Lectwer on Chemistry

in St. Mary's Hospital Medical School, and Charles H. Piesse, Assistant

Analyst in St. Thomas's Hospital.

Through the kindness of Messrs. Piesse and Lubin, we have had the oppoiiimity

of examining a specimen of pure oil of orange-peel. As stated by Soubeiran and

Capitaine, and also by Dr. Gladstone, this oil consists mainly of a hydrocarbon of
Weformula C,,, IIj^, boiling at 174° C, .and termed Hesperidene.
                                                                  find that the crude

oil commences to boil at 175°, and that 97-2 per cent, comes over below 179° ; on

redistillation over sodium this portion all comes over between 175° and 177°

(uncorrected). The remaining 2-8 per cent, is a soft resin, which does not harden

on standing, and is perfectly fluid at 100°. It is not volatile without decomposition,

and after complete volatilization of residual hesperidene is inodorous ; in alcohol,
even boiling, it is but sparingly soluble, readily soluble in ether, and insoluble in
water, to which, however, it commimicates the aromatic bitter taste of orange-peel.
It contains no nitrogen, and on combustion gives numbers agreeing with the

formula Cj^HjuOg.
   Hesperidene redistilled over sodium is attacked with violence by concentrated

warm nitric acid ; by dilution of the acid vidth its own bullv of water the action

becomes less violent ; after boiling some hours with an inverted condenser attached,
the evolution of red fumes and of CO^ almost ceases. At this stage the hydro-
carbon has principally formed a brown resinous substance, becoming a very thick

viscid liquid at 100°, "but setting on coohng to a hard brittle mass. This contains

much nitrogen and less hydrogen in proportion to the carbon than the original

substance. Its examination is not yet completed, but the numbers obtained are
consistent with the supposition that it is derived from the original hydi-ocarbon by

addition of oxygen and replacement of hydrogen by NO^.

   With .strong nitric acid this brown resin is fui-ther acted on, producing a yellow

resin not softening at 100°, and containing nitrogen and less carbon and hydrogen

than the brown resin. Much oxalic acid is also produced, and probably also

another acid containing nitrogen ; for the snow-white oxalic acid got by precipita-
tion as lead-salt, decomposition withhydric sulphide, and several recrystpllizations

from water, contained much nitrogen, and yielded (as well as its silver salt)

numbers not agreeing with but approximating to those required by theory.

   On heating one part of hesperidene with a mixture of three parts potassium

                                                                                                      6*

diclironiate, one of sulphuric acid, aud thirty of water, an inverted condenser being
attached, a slow evolution of CO^ is noticed. After six or eight hours but little
action has appareutlj^ taken place ; but on distilling the product there is obtained,
besides unaltered hesperidene, an acid liquid, which yields by neutralization a
barium salt, giving all the qualitative reactions of acetate, and containing the cal-
culated percentage of barium ; a little formiate is possibly also produced, as the
barium salt reduces silver nitrate slightlj^ on boiling. The silver salt got by
precipitation with strong silver nitrate and recrystallization from boiling water is

pure acetate.

   The action of potassium chlorate and sulphuric acid on hesperidene is very
energetic, a viscid tany 'substance, not yet examined, being produced.

  --The production of acetic acid fi'om hesperidene renders a grouping of carbon

atoms of the following nature probable :

  We hope to be able to gain some further insight into the stmcture of the gi-oup

C^ H,2, and propose to submit to examination several other essential oils, hoping

that the results may throw some light on the causes of the "physical isomerism "

of the turpentine group of hydrocarbons.

   On certain new Derivatives from Codeia. By C. R. A. Wrigitt, D.Sc,

             Lecturer on Chemisfri/ in St. Mari/'s Hospital Medical Scliool.

  When codeia is heated to 100° C. for two or three hours with from three to six

parts of aqueous hj-drobromic acid containing 48 per cent. IIBr, there are formed,

without appreciable evolution of methyl bromide, three new bases, of which the
two last are produced by a further action on the first. These are

                Bromocodick  C,, H^oBrNO^

                Deoxycodeia  ^'ie^^2i  NOj

                Bromotetracodeia C^^ H^j Br N^ Oj,.

   The two first are soluble in ether, and may thus be separated (after precipitation
by sodium carbonate) from the last, which is almost insoluble in this medium. By

agitation of the etherial extract with hydrobromic acid there is obtained a viscid

liquid, which contains little but bromocodide hydrobromate, if the digestion of the

codeia have been carried on for a short time only, but contains also much deoxy-
codeia hj'drobromate if the digestion have been continued somewhat longer. This

latter salt separates in crystals from the viscid liquid on standing, the bromocodide

hydrobromate furnishing a gummy mass only on standing and evaporation.
   By dissolving the portion insoluble in ether in dilute hydrobromic acid, and

fractionally precipitating the coloured solution thus got with strong hydrobromic

acid several times successively, bromotetracodeia hydrobromate is ultimately

obtained in white amorphous flakes, that become tarry if warmed while moist,

and colour more or less on drying. When once dry, a temperature of lOO^C. does

not soften the amorphous salt.

   (C) From deoxycodeia : only blackened tarry substances, not fit for analysis

hence probably the deoxymorphia got Bin is not formed from deoxycodeia "pre-

Yiously produced.

   Deoxymorphia and bromotetramorphia much resemble in all their properties

their homologues deoxycodeia and bromotetracodeia ; the first gives crystalline
salts, the second amorphous ones.

   The constitutions of all the above have been verified by analyses of the hydro-

bromates, hydrochlorates, platinum salts, &c. In qualitative reactions, the deoxy-
salts are identical with apomorphia salts.

   On treating bromotetracodeia and bromotetramorphia with excess of cold strong

hydrochloric acid, dissolving in water, and fractionally precipitating by strong
liydi-ochloric acid, the bromine in these bases becomes replaced iDy chlorine,
yielding the following bodies, that much resemble in all their properties the cor-
responding brominated salts :

Chlorotetracodeia hydrochlorate C^, ^^3 CI Nj O;,, 4HC1
Chlorotetramorphia hydrochlorate C^^ H^, CI N^ Ojj, 4HC1.

   By digesting codeia for six hours at 100° with hydrobromic acid, there was

obtained a substance that ga'^e numbers (after treatment with hydrochloric acid)

intermediate between those required for the two last-named bodies. This may

have been only a mixture of these two ; but it seems very probable that a series of

products should exist intermediate between these extremes, viz,

Cgg H-- BrN^ 0,2 = Bromotetramorphia

C^,,H^,, Clls, Oj2 = Chlorodicodeia-dimorpliia

=C72 H^3 CIN^ Oj2 Chlorotetracodeia.

   Assuming that this substance was not a mixture, it might be termed chloro-

dicodeia-dimorpliia.

    Dr. Michael Foster finds that the tetracodeia and tetramorphia compounds
produce in adult cats a great excitement of the nervous svstem, and apparently
paralyze the inhibitory fibres of the pneumogastric. Apparently the morphia
compounds are somewhat more potent than the codeia bodies in this case.

   Deoxycodeia and deoxymorphia salts produce in adult cats convulsions more

epileptic in character than tetanic. No trace of emetic symptoins has been observed

with any of the salts of this class of bases, which in physiological efi'ect, as
well as chemical reactions, are almost indistinguishable the one from the other.

   This absence of emetic symptoms conclusivelj' proves that apomorpliia is not
among the products of the action of hydrobromic acid on codeia. From its known
production from this base by tlie action of hydrochloric acid, as well as from the
analytical numbers obtained, the formation of apomorphia has been previously
looked upon as probable.

   By the action of hydriodic acid containing 55 per cent. Ill on codeia in presence

of phosphorus, a series of substances have been formed that present the composi-
tions included in one or other of the two general formulfe,

                             +4X -I- hTII pll, 0,

Xwhere represents a base containing two atoms of hydrogen more than morphia
= Y X(i. e. Oi7 H21 NO3), and
                            a base containing one atom of oxygen less than

=({. e. Cj7 H.,1 NOo). Simultaneously with the production of these substances,

iodide of methyl, in quantity representing almost exactly Jg- of the carbon in the

codeia used, is evolyed.

   By allowing the action of 10 parts codeia, 30 of 55 per cent, hydi-iodic acid, and

3 of phosphorus, to take place at 100°, a compoimd is produced separable from the
viscid liquid resulting from the reaction by addition of water, washing, and drying

at 100^, and representing in constitution the formula

   4X + 6HI = 0,, H,, I, N, Oj,, 4HI.

If, however, the reaction take place at a somewhat higher temperature, a similar
body containing two molecules of water less is formed,

                  4X + 6HI - 2H, = C,3 n,, I, N, 0,,,, 4HI

whilst if the mixture be allowed to boil rapidly, so as to distil off most of the
excess of hydriodic acid employed, and ultimately raise the boiling-point to 130°
or upwards, the product contains four atoms of oxygen less tlian this last com-
pound, being

               4Y + GHI - 2H, = C,, H,, I, N, 0,, 4HI.

Simultaneously with these bodies much phosphorous and phosphoric acids are

produced.

   On dissolving these substances in hot water and cooling, there are obtained

products apparentlj^ crystalline to the eye, but imder the microscope consisting of

coalesced globules only. In this way the following bodies have been obtained :--

   + =4X + 6111 - 2H, = Ce, H,,IN, 0,,,, 4111
   4X 4III - 2H,                    C,, H,,, N, 0,,,, 4HI

   + =4Y 4II1 4- 2H, O C,, H^, N, 0,,,, 4111.

   The free bases of some of the foregoing hydi-iodates have also been obtained.
They oxidize very readily, forming orange-coloured substances that ultimately
become black.

   Finally, by the action of hydriodic acid on the three bodies of the formulas last

given, the elements of HI and also of H^ are taken up ; the following compounds

having been thus obtained,

   +4X 7III + 10H,O = C,JI,,,l3N,0.,.,, 4HI
   + + = N4Y 7 [II
                            O8II:,  C,, H, ,,3 1, . 0::, 4HI
   + =4Y 5III 4- 2H:
                                    Cs3 H,3 I N, 0,,, 4HI.

  The H^ O thus taken up remains firmly imited to the body of the molecule,

exposure to a temperature of 100° for days not driving off any water.

   In qualitative reactions, all these bodies are very similar : alkalies throw down
a white precipitate of variable composition in the case of those bases which contain

iodine united to the molecule of base. In aU cases this white precipitate rapidly
becomes yellow, orange, and linallj' brown, oxygen being absorbed. In water and
sodium carbonate these precipitates are but little soluble ; in ammonia, and espe-

cially caustic potash, readily soluble.

    Oxidizing agents (e. g. nitric acid) produce a bright yellow or orange-yellow

tint.

   In most of the above reactions, this set of compoimds differs much from those got
by the action of hydi'ochloric and hydrobromic acids ; the free bases of these latl:er

derivatives having a tendency to become green by oxidation in the air, and yielding
red or imrple colorations with oxidizing agents.

   The codeia used in the experiments above described formed part of a large
supply, exceeding twenty ounces, most liberally presented for the purpose by
Messrs. J. F. Macfarlane and Co., of Edinburgh.

          Address ly Archibald Geikie, F.B.S., President of the Section.

Instead of offering to the Geological Section of the British Association an
opening Address on some special aspect or branch of general Geologj^, I have
thought that it might be more interesting, and perhaps even more useful, if I were
to lay before jou an outline of the geology of the district in which we are uow

assembled. Accordingly, iu the remarks which I am now about to make, I propose

to sketch to j-ou the broader features of the geological structure and history of
Edinburgh and its neighbourhood, dwelling more especially on those parts which
have more than a mere local interest, as illusti-ative of the general principles of

our science.
   It woidd be as unnecessary as it would be out of place here to cite the long

array of authors who have each added to our Imowledgo of the geology of this
district, and many of them also, at the same time, to tlie broad fundamental truths
of geology. And yet it would be strange to speak here of the rocks of Edinburgh
Avithout even a passing tribute of gratitude to men like Hutton, Hall, Jamieson,
Hay Cunningham, Ilibbert, Hugh Miller, Fleming, Milne Home, and our late

--esteemed and venerable associate, Charles Maclaren men v,dio have made the

rocks of Edinburgh familiar to geologists all over the world. If, therefore, I make
no further allusion to these and other names, it is neither that I forget for a mo-

ment their claims, nor that I now bring forward any new material of my own, but

because I wish to be understood as dealing with facts which, thanks to the labours of

our predecessors, have become part of the common stock of geological knowledge.
   For the purpose of gaining as clear au idea as may be of the rock^. among which

Edinburgh lies, and of the way in which they are grouped together, let us imagine

ourselves placed on the battlements of the Castle, where, hj varying our position,

we may obtain a clear view of the country in every direction for many miles
round. To the south-east the horizon is bounded b}' a I'ange of high ground,

rising as a long tableland above the lowland of Midlothian. That is a portion of
the wide Silurian uplands of the south of Scotland, forming here the chain of

heights known as the Lammermuir and Jloorfoot Hills. Along most of its boun-

dary line, in tliis district, the Silm-ian tableland descends with tolerable rapidity
towards the plain, being bounded on its north-west side with a long fault, by

which the Carboniferous rocks are brought down against the hills. These Silurian

rocks are the oldest strata of the district ; and it is on their contorted and greatly
denuded beds that the later formations have been laid down.

   Turning now to the south, we see the chain of heights known as the Pentland

Hills, striking almost from the very suburbs of Edinburgh south-westward in the
direction of the Silurian uplands, which they eventually reach in the coimty of
Lanark. This Hue of hills rises along an anticlinal axis by which the broad Car-
boniferous tract of the Lothians is divided into two distinct portions. The Pent-^

lands themselves consist, as I shall afterwards point out, chiefly of rocks of Old Red

Sandstone age ; but the anticlinal fold along which thej' rise is prolonged through
the Braid Hills, and through the Carboniferous ground by the Castle Eock of
Edinburgh, even as far as the opposite shores of Fife. From the Castle we can
readily foUow with the eye the eli'ects of this gxeat dominant fold of the rocks. To

the east, we mark how the strata dip away eastward fi'om the axis of movement,
as is shown in the escarpments of Salisbury Crag, Arthm-'s Seat, and Calton Hill,
while on the opposite or western side the escarpment of the wooded hill of Cors-
torphine, facing towards us, points out the westward dip. From the same stand-
point we can even detect the passage of the arch into Fife ; for the rocks about

Aberdour are seen dipping to the west, while eastward tliey bend over and dip
towards the east at Kinghorn.

   Although the structure of the district is simple when the existence and position
of this anticlinal axis is recognized, some little complication is introduced hy a
long powerful fault which flanks the axis on its south-eastern side. The efi'ect of

this fault is to throw out a great part of the lower division of the Carboniferous
formations, and to bring the Carboniferous Limestone series in some places close

against tlie Lower Old Eed Sandstone and its volcanic rocks. Another result has

been the extreme tilting of the strata, -whereby the Limestone series along the east
side of the fault has been thrown on end, and even in some parts bent back into a
reversed dip. Hence, while on one side of the axis the Limestone series is some-

times only a few hundi-ed yards distant from the Old Red Sandstone, on the oppo-

site or north-west side the distance is fully eleven mUes, the intervening space
being there occupied by endless undulations of the lower divisions of the Carboni-
ferous system. Hence, too, the MiUstone-giit and Coal-measiu-es come in along

the centre of the Midlothian basin a short way to the east of the Pentland axis
while on the west side they are not met with tiU we reach the borders of Stii-ling-

shire and Linlithgow.
    Another remarkable and readily observable feature is, that on the west side of

the Pentland ridge the Carboniferous formations, from almost theu- base up to the
top of the Carboniferous Limestone series, aboimd in contemporaneous volcanic
rocks ; while on the east side, beyond Edinburgh and Arthur's Seat, such rocks are

absent until we reach the Garltou Hills, to the north of Haddington, where they

reappear, but in a very different type from that which they exhibit to the west.

   Let us now pass in review the different geological formations which come into

the district around us, beginning with the oldest and ascending through the others

till we reach the superficial acciunulations, and mark, in conclusion, how far the

present surface-features are connected with geological structure.
    [The author then described the various geological formations of the district

--Silurian, Old Ked Sandstone, and Carboniferous dwelling in particiUar upon the
--history of volcanic action in that part of Scotland. On this subject he remai'ked :

                    Outline of the History of Volcanic Action aroimd Edinhirr/h.

    The oldest ^-olcanoes of this part of Scotland were those which, duiing the time
 of the Lower Old Red Sandstone, poured out the great sheets of poi-ph\Tite and
the showers of tuff which now form the main mass of the range of the Pentland
HiUs. During the same long geological period volcanic action was rife, as we
 have seen, along the whole of the broad midland valley of Scotland, since to that
 time we must refer the origin of the Sidlaw and the Ocliil Hills, part of eastern
 Berwickshire, and the long line of uplands stretching from the Pentland Hills
 through Lanarkshire, and across Nithsdale, far into A^Tshire.

    Of volcanic action, during the remainder of the Old Red Sandstone period, there
 is around Edinburgh no trace. But early in the following or Carboniferous period,
 the volcano of Arthur's Seat and Calton Hill came into existence, and threw out
 its tiny flows of basalt and porphyrite, and its showers of ashes. From that time
 onwards, through nearly the whole of the interval occupied by the deposition of
 the Carboniferous Limestone series, the district to the west of Edinbm-gh was

 dotted over with small cones, usually of tuff, but sometimes emitting limited
 currents of different basalt rocks, more especially in the space between Bathgate
 and the Forth, where a long bank, chiefly formed of such lava-currents, was piled up

 over and among the pools and shallows in which the limestones, sandstones, shales,
 and coal-seams were accumulated. To the north, also, similar volcanic activity was
 shown in the Fife tracts nearest tlie Forth ; while eastwards, between ILaddiiigton
  and Dunbar, there \a\ a distinct volcanic focus, where gieat showers of red fel-
  spatliic tuff and widespread sheets of porphyrite were ejected to form a bank over
  which the Carboniferous Limestone series was at length tranquilly deposited.

      Volcanic activity seems to have died out here before tlie close" of the Carboni-
  ferous Limestone period. It remained quiescent during the deposition of the Mill-
  stone-grit and Coal-measures ; at least no trace of any contemporaneous igneous
  ejection is found in any part of these formations. The'intrusive masses of various
  basalt rocks, which here intersect the older half of the Carboniferous system, arc,

  in all probability, of Lower Carboniferous date, connected with the eruptions of
  the interbedded volcanic rocks. The next proofs of volcanic action in this neigh-
  bourhood are furnished by the upper part of Arthur's Seat. At that locality we
  discover that after more than SOOO feet of strata had been removed by denudation
  from the Pentland anticliual fold so as to lay bare the old Lower Carboniferous
  volcanic rocks of Edinburgh, a new focus of eruption was formed, from which
rKANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                             89

·were ejected the basalts and coarse agglomerates of tlie summit and shoiilders of
Arthm-'s Seat. There is no trustworthj' evidence for fixing the geological date of
this eruption. Evidently, from the gi-eat denudation by which it was preceded,
it must belong to a much later period than any of the Carboniferous eruptions.
Yet, from the gTeat similarity of the Arthiu-'s Seat agglomerate, both in compo-
sition and mode of occurrence, to numerous " necks " which rise through all parts
of the Carboniferous system between Nithsdale and Fife, and which I have shown

to mark the position of volcanic orihces during Permian times, I am inclined to

regard these later igneous rocks of Edinburgh as dating from the Permian period.
Ai'tluu-'s Seat, however, seems to have been the onlj' volcano in action during that

period in this neighbourhood.
    There still remains, for notice one further and final feature of the volcanic his-

tory of this part of Scotland. Rising inditferently through any part of the other
rocks, whether aqueous or^igneous, and marked by a singular uniformity of direction,
there is a series of basalt dykes which deserves attention. They have a general
easterly and westerly trend, and even where, as in Linlithgowshire, they traverse
tracts of basalt-rocks, they preserve their independence, and continue as readily

separable as when they are found intersecting sandstones and shales. These dykes

belong to that extensive series which, running across a great part of Scotland, the
north of England, and the north-east of Ireland, passes into, and is intimatety con-

nected with, the wide basaltic plateaux of Antrim and the Inner Hebrides. They
date, in fact, from Miocene times, and, from their numbers, their extent, and the
distance to which they can be traced from the volcanic centre of the north-west,
they remain as a striking memorial of the vigour of volcanic action during the last

period of its manifestation in this country.

                                                   Glacial Phenomena.

   To an eye accustomed to note the characteristic impress of ice-action upon a
land-surface, the^ueighbourhood of Edinburgh presents many features of interest.
It was upon Corstorphine Hill, on the western outskirts of the city, that Sir James
Hall first called attention to striated rock-surfaces which, though erroneously at-
tributed to the abrasion produced by torrents of water, were even then recognized
as trustworthy evidence of the last great geological changes that had passed over
the surface of the countrj'. Even before we come to look at the sm'face in detail,
and note the striation of its rocks, we cannot fail to recognize the distinctively ice-
worn aspect of the hills round Edinburgh. Each of them is, in fact, a great roche
inoutuunee, left in the path of the vast ice-sheet which passed across the land.
That this ice was of sufiicient depth and mass to override even the highest hills,
is proved not merely by the general ice-worn surface of the landscape, but by the
occurrence of characteristic striaj -on the summits of the Pentland Hills, 1600 feet
above the sea ; that it came from the Highlands, is indicated by the pebbles
of granite, gneiss, schist, and quartz rock occurring in the older boulder-clays
which it produced ; and that, defiected by the mass of the southern uplands, the
ice in the Aalley of the Lothians was forced to move seawards, in a direction a little
north of east, is shown by the trend of the strins gTaven on the rocks, as at Cors-
torphine, Grantou, Arthur's Seat, and Pentland HUls.

Connc.viun of the present form of the Surface with Geological Structure.

In concluding these outlines, let me direct the attention of the Section to the

bearing which the geological structure of the district wherein we are now assem-

bled has upon the broad and much canvassed question of the origin of land-

surfaces. In the first place, we cannot fail to be struck with the evidence of

enormous denudation which the rocks of the district have undergone. Every for-

mation, from the oldest to the latest, lias suffered, and the process of waste has

Webeen going on apparently from the earliest times.  .see that the Lower Silu-

rian rocks were upheaved and denuded before the time of the Lower Old Eed

Sandstone ; that the latter formation had undergone enormous erosion before the

beginning of the Carboniferous period ; that of the Carboniferous rocks, a thick-

ness more than 3000 feet had been worn away from the site of Arthur's Seat be-

fore the last eruptions of that hill, which are possibly as old as the Pennian period
90 REPORT--1871.

that still further and vaster denudation took place before the setting in of the Ice-

age                 and finaUy,  that the  deposits  of that  age  have since  been to a large  extent
                 ;

removed. AVith the proofs, therefore, of such continued destruction, it would be

vain to look for any aboriginal outline of the surface, or hope to find any of the

later but still early features of the landscape remaining permanent amid the sur-

rounding waste.

In the second place we note that, in the midst of this greatly denuded area, it

is the harder rocks which form the hills and crags. Those masses which in the

long process of waste presented most resistance to the powers of destruction, are

just those which, as we might expect, rise into eminences, while those whose re-

sistance was least sink into plains and -(-aUej-s. ALL the craggy heights which

form so conspicuous a feature of Edinburgh and its neighbourliood, are composed

of hard igneous rocks, the undulating lowlands lie upon soft aqueous rocks.

In the third place, the coincidence of the position of hills and crags with the

existence of ancient igneous rocks, cannot be misinterpreted by ascribing the pre-

sence and form of the hills to the outlines assumed by the igneous material ejected

to the surface from below. The hiUs are not due to igneous upheaval at all, but

can be shown to have been buried deep under subsequent accumulations, to have

been bent and broken with all the bendings and brcalcs these later formations un-

derwent, and to have been finally brouglit to light again only after a long cycle of

denudation had removed the mass of rock under which they had been concealed.

What is true of the hills of Edinburgh, is true also of all the older volcanic districts

o j Britain. Even where the hills consist of volcanic rocks, their existence, as

hills, can be proved to be one of tlie results not of upheaval but of denudation.

In the fom-th place, this district furnishes an instructive illustration of the in-

fluence of faults upon the external contour of a country. The faults here do not

form valleys. On the contrary, the vallej's have been cut across them in innu-

merable instances. In the liallieith coal-field, for example, the valleys and ra-

vines of tlie river Esk travei-se faults of 190 to nearlj' .500 feet, yet there is no in-

equality at the surface, the whole ground having been planed down by denudation

to one common level. "When, however, a fault brings together rocks which differ

mucli in their relative powers of resistance to waste, tlie side of the dislocation

occupied by the harder rocks will tend to form an eminence, while the opposite

side, consisting of softer rocks, will be worn down into a hollow or plain. Con-

spicuous examples are furnished by the faults which, along the flanks of the Pent-

land Hills, have brought down the comparatively dcstnictible sandstones and

shales of the Carboniferous series, against the much less easily destroyed porphy-

rites and conglomerates of the Old Red Sandstone.

In fine, we learn here as elsewhere in oiu' country, and here more strikingly

than often elsewhere, on account of the varied geological structure of the district,

that the present landscape has resulted from a long course of sculpturing, and that

how much soever that process may have been accelerated or retarded by underground

movements, it is b}' the slow but irresistible action of rain and frost, springs, ice,

and the sea, that out of the various geological formations among which Edinburgh

lies, her picturesque outline of hill and valley, crag and ravine, has, step by step,

been carved.

   The Lias of Yorkshire is exposed on the coast for a distance of about 30 miles,
and owing to faults and undulations the series is repeated twice, one main area
being to the north, the other to the south of Whitby ; and there are two outlying

patches, one of the highest beds at Peak, the other of the lowest beds at Eedcai-.

   The basis of the description in this paper is the division into Ammonite zones,
as by Oppel and others.

 --1. Zone of Ammonites Jurensis. These occur at Peak. The author has not found

the characteristic Ammonite in situ, but recognizes the zone by its peculiar fauna.

It appears to be divided into an upper and lower division.

--the allied brevispina is highly characteristic of the beds, which are very fossiliferous.
   8. Zone of ^?«. arnudus. This is well represented; the P/M»«ybfe;/j is conter-

minous with the two last zones, which end the Middle Lias.

The last four zones are similar in lithological character, being shaly beds with

scattered dogger bands.

--The zones below this are only seen at Robin Hood's Bay and Redcar.

9. Zone of Am. raricostcdns. This is well developed in micaceous shaly beds,

--indurated at the top, which is the character also of all the succeeding zones.
  10. Zone of Am. oxynotus. Also well developed, containing a strong limestone

band.

 --11. Zone of ^)H. Turneri. Is only found on the shore.
 --12. Zone of Am. vbtusus. Seen at Peak.
 --1.3. Zone of Am. Bucklandi. Forms the lowest beds seen at Robin Hood's Bay,

and the highest at Redcar. They do not contain limestone as elsewhere. An

ichthyosanr has been found in these, such having been hitherto only announced

--from the Upper Lias in Y'orkshire.
   14. Zone of Am. anyuJatus. This is represented by thin shaly beds at Redcar,
where this Ammonite is abundant ; and also by a limestone-bed near Market

--Weighton, at which latter place it contains a wevf and varied fauna.
   15. Zone of Am. plauorbis. Hitherto only washed up from the sea in fragments.
Its beds have now been discovered near Market Weighton, where they contain

numerous foraminifera. In this locality the oyster-bands and white lias are reached,

but not the bone-bed.

The lithological character and the position of all these zones were described

in the paper.

On ilie Silurian liocl'S of the SoutJi of Scotland. By D. J. Bro-wn.

This paper was illustrated by a map and section, also specimens of rocks and

fossils.

In a section drawn from Moffat Water in Dumfriesshire to Kilbucho in Peeble-

weshire,  have, first,  the Bloffat rocks,   which consist  of hard blue grit           {Grey-

wacke) and shale. These are accompanied by beds of anthracite and black shale

containing Graptolites ; on leaving IMoffat Water, we first meet anthracite beds,
then a series of grit and shale ; this order is repeated six times. The last time we

see anthracite beds is at Holmes-water-head, where we find them plunging under

the limestone and conglomerate of Wrae and Glencotho, over the whole length

of the section from Motfat Water to Holmes Water. The beds stand at a high

angle, and have an almost uniform northernly dip. From Holmes Water to Kil-
Webucho the rocks are of a more diversified character.
                                                            have first a coarse angular

conglomerate, then a bed of limestone with fossils, mostly of a Caradoc type ; next

a series of beds of slate, shale, and grit ; these beds come up again at Kilbucho.

After Holmes Water we have no longer the imiform northernly dip, but the beds

undidate, and in one section are seen to form regular waves.

These beds all along the line of the section, from the river Tweed to Kilbucho,

are given in the Government Geological Map of Peebleshire as one series of Llan-

--deilo age. The author is of opinion that they form two series a lower Mofiat or

Llandeilo, and an upper or Caradoc series that lies imconfomiable upon the lower.

The author has come to the conclusion that the two series are imconformable :

First,because we find the anthracite beds at a high angle plunging under the limestone

and Conglomerate of Glencotho and Wrae at Holmes-water-head, and emerging at

the same angle in the Moor-foot Hills. Second, because we find these upper rocks

everj-where underlaid by a bed of coarse angular Conglomerate; and this conglomerate

is found in fragments, and nowhere in situ, in the neighbourhood of Moffat, which

is on the opposite watershed, being, as the author thinks, fragments of the lower

rocks left in the process of denudation. Third, this Conglomerate is found to con-

tain numerous fragments of anthracitic shale containing Graptolites belonging to

lower beds, proving that the lower rocks were consolidated, and then torn into frag-

ments before the upper rocks were laid down.

On the Upper Silurian liocls of the Pentland Hills and Lesmahago.
                               By D. J. Brown.

This paper was illustrated by a map and two sections.

In a paper published in the Transactions of the Edinburgh Geological Society,

vol. i., written by Mr. Henderson and the author, it was shown that in the North Esk

section of the Pentland Hills there is a very perfect Wenlock fauna, and that it is

only towards  the top of the  section  that  the Ludlow species  come  in               it was further
                                                                                     ;

shown, from Silurian fossils collected from the Red Conglomerate lying at the

top of the section, that these Red Conglomerates were not a part of the Lower

Old Red Sandstone, but a continuation of the Silurian, and that the whole Silurian

rocks in the Lyne water form a continuous section above them. In the district

of Lesmahago the Upper Silurians are said to form a continuous series with the

Lower Old Red Sandstone that lies above them. In " Memoir 32, Geological Sur-

vey of Scotland," the same phenomena are said to occur in the Pentlauds, and Mr.

Salter draws a parallel between these beds and those of Lesmahago ; but from this

comparison he omits the section in the Lyne water, which forms a continuous series

above the Red Rocks, said to be Old Red Sandstone, so that these Old Red Sand-

stone beds of the Government Survey lie ri^ht in the centre of the continuous sec-

tion of Upper Silurian, and contain Upper Silurian fossils. As it is only towards

the top of the North Esk section that we find any fossils belonging to the Lesma-

hago beds, and they difler from them very much in their hthological character, the

author is of opinion that these beds are not the equivalent of the Lesmahago beds

but that these latter form an upper series overlying the Pentland beds.

    Geological Notes on the Noursoak Peninsula and Disco Island in North
            Greenland. Bij Robekt Beoatx, M.A., Ph.D., F.R.G.S., Sfc.

   The geology of Greenland has been partially investigated, so fai- as the west coast
is concerned, by Giesecke, Pingel, Rink, and to some extent by Inglefield, Suther-
land, Kane, Hayes, and the late Mr. Olrik, so many years Inspector of North Green-
land and Director of the Kgl. Gronlandske Handel in Copenhagen. More recently
the author and his companions made sections and collected fossils from the vicinity
of the localities named ; and this paper was an account of the geological results of
this voyage, made in 1867. Since then several Swedish naturalists have visited
the country, and the German Expedition to East Greenland has added to our know-
ledge of the geology and tertiary flora of East Greenland. The formations found
in Greenland are :--

   (1) Primitive rocls, chiefly syenite, gi'anitic, and various gneissose rocks, very
widely distributed, reaching in some places to a height of 4000 feet or more. Eti
this formation are found the chief economic minerals of Greenland, kryolite, soap-

stone, &c.

   (2) " The Ped Sandstone of Igalliko Ijord,''^ probably Devonian^ but only a patch,
now being rapidly destroyed by the sea.

   (3) Mesozoic rucls : only a patch in the vicinity of Omenak, most probably

cretaceous.

   (4) Miocene : confined entirely to the vicinity of the Waigatz Strait and part
of Omenak Fjord, on the west coast, though most probably it once extended right

over Greenland in that line, thougli now either desti-oyed or overlain by the great

interior ice. It makes its appearance on the east coast, and is also found in

Spitzbergen.

   The next portion of Dr. Brown's paper was occupied in describing in detail the
Miocene beds and sections seen at various places; the whole concluding with a
criticism of the conclusions of Professor Heer, of Zurich, who had described the
plants discovered by Dr. Brown and others, and in giving what he considered was
a just view of the results which the palceontologist might logically deduce from the
facts already observed. After giving some account of Greenland "coal, its structure,
chemical composition, and economic Aalue, lie furnished a list of the animal- and
plant-remains already found in the INIiocene and Cretaceous beds in Greenland, and
indicated what points remain still to be investigated. Chief among these he in-
stanced the Mesozoic deposits already mentioned. As the Association had already
voted a sum of money for tliis purpose, ho thought that if it was judiciously ex-
pended through means of some of the well-educated and intelligent Danish officers
resident in Greenland, who were accustomed to such work, good results might be

accomplished.

 On the Vegetable Contents of Masses of Limestone' Occurring in Trappean

   liochs in Fifeshire, and the conditions under which they are preserved. By
   W. Careuthers, F.R.S.

    The shore to the east of Kingswood End is strewn with large fragments of a

limestone which Mr. G. Grieve, of Burntisland, detected to be filled with vege-
table remains. This limestone was traced by Mr. Grieve to the clifts above, where
he found it enclosed in the centre of tlie trappean tuff. Having received from
him several specimens, the author recently spent some time, in companv with Prof.
Morris, in investigating this important discovery of Mr. Grieve, under his direction.
The specimens occur in angular masses in the volcanic ash, and are fragments of
beds existing before the formation of the bed of ash. At Elie fragments of
 coniferous wood abound in a similar bed, and there, as at Kingswood End, the ash
 contains numerous fragments of shale, limestone, sandstone, &c. The author
 beheved that the plant-remains had been enclosed in the fonn of peat, from a

daloidal cavities of the rock, having speedily seized and fixed them, preserving all
the details of the tissue. The plants are stems, fruits and leaves of carboniferous
plants, and innumerable roots penetrate the mass in every direction. The characters
of these plants are beautifidly shown on the shore fragments, which are polished

by blown sand. At this place the great power of air-driven sand is veiy evident
on the black basalt, which is all smoothed and almost glazed on its western
aspect. The author believed that the continuous bed of limestone containing
vegetables, above Ivingswood End, was different from the blocks on the shore and
those in the trappean ash, because of the different mineral conditions and organic

contents.

On the General Conditions of ths Glacial Epoch ; with Sufff/estions on the
                      formation of Lalce-hasins. Bif John Cuhet.

   The paper contains a detailed topographical account of glacial drift in the north
of England, from which the author passes on to discuss the general conditions of
the glacial epoch. Increase and diminution of a polar ice-cap is the cause, in the
author's judgment, of the movements of subsidence and elevation of sea-level of

the glacial period. He maintains that the submerged forests of many parts of the

coast have been preserved by being imbedded in a sheet of ice. Remarks on the
origin of lake-basins follow. The author cites evidence to show the power of ice
and debris to dam up streams, and bases his conclusions largely upon facts quoted
from Mr. Jamieson's paper in vol. i. of the Geological Journal.

           On the General Geology of Queensland. By E,. Dainteee.

This paper was illustrated by a series of photographs ; a number of fossils and

rock specimens had been collected by the author, but they were, unfortunately,

nil lost in the wreck of the ' Queen of the Thames.' The author recognized in

Queensland metamorphic and igneous rocks, and the equivalents, to some extent,

of our Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, Liassic (?), Oolitic, and Cretaceous for-
Amations.
               still higher series of sandstones occurred, bat their precise age had

not yet been determined. Alluvial deposits fringed all the water-courses, and had

yielded remains of extinct marsupials. It was in these alluvial deposits that the

miner met with his chief supply of " free " gold. In the beds which Mr. Daintree

refers with doubt to the Lias, coal-seams of varied quality occur. They are only

employed for local purposes, and no attempt has yet been made to ascertain their

number and relative position. This coal-field occupies a certain district in the

south of Queensland, but another coal-field, belonging to the Carboniferous for-

mation, is met with in tlie north. None of the coals there have been worked,
owing to the want of railway communication. In the passage-beds between the
Carboniferous and Devonian formations, auriferous lodes occur, all the mineral
veins of the country appearing either in Upper rala30zoic or Metamoi-phic
rocks. Copper and lead-ore also al}ound. The author believes there is a close
connexion between the occurrence of veins and tlie appearance of Trappean dis-

turbance.

     The Relation of the Quaternary Mammalia to the Glacial Period.
                          By W. EoTD DAWKijfs, F.ll.S.

The animals fell naturally into five distinct groups, the first of which comprises

those now living in the temperate regions of Europe and America, including the

Grizzly Bear, the Ljnx, the Bison, and the Wild Boar, and binds the Quater-

nary to the present fauna. The second gToup comprises those animals which are

now confined to cold regions, such as the Glutton, Reindeer, Musk Sheep, and

the  Tailless  Hare                             they constitute  the  iVrctic  division of  Quaternary Mammalia,

a hot climate. The only mode of getting over this discrepancy is to suppose that
in those days the winter cold was very severe, and the summer heat intense, so
that in the summer time the animals, now found in warmer regions, migrated north-
wards, and in the winter time those now found in the Ai-ctic regions went south-
wards. The fourtli group consists of such extinct forms 'as the Cave Bear, the
Stag, the Mammoth, and the Woolly Ehinoceros. The tifth gi'oup includes the
Sabre-tootJied Tiger, the Irish Elk, Rhinoceros mec/arhinus and R. hemitcecJius, and
they, with some others, show that there is no great break between the Quaternary
and the Pliocene, such as would warrant any sharply defined division of great
value. The interest centered more particularly in the Arctic group ; and so far as
the evidence went, it seemed to be extremely probable that they were in occupa-
tion of the areas in Great Britain in which they were found during the time
the other areas, in which they were not found, v/ere covered with glaciers ; and
this period may be put down to that of the latest sojourn of the glaciers in the
highest grounds of our islands, and even so far south as the districts of Auvergne

and Dauphine.

On the Progress of the Geohr/ical Surveij in Scotland. By Prof. Geikie, F.E.S.

When the British Association last met in Scotland, I had the honour of bringing

before this Section a report upon the progress of the Geological Survey, from the
time of its commencement liere in 1854 by Professor Ramsay, under the direction of

the late Sir Henry De la Beche, up to the year 1867, rmder the supen'ision of the

present Director, Sir Roderick Murchison. During tlie fom- years which have since
elapsed, considerable advance has been made in the suney of the southern half of

Scotland ; and I propose now, with the sanction of Sir Roderick, to present to you
a brief outline of what has been done, and of the present state of the Survey.

  At the time of my previous report rather more than .3000 square miles had been

surveyed. Since then we have completed 2700 square miles additional, making a

total area of nearly COOO square miles. Of this area 3175 square miles have been

published on the one-inch scale, and three sheets, representing in all G.'32 square

miles, are now in course of being engraved. Tlie whole country is surveyed upon
the Ordnance Maps on the scale of six inches to a mile, and from these field-maps
the work is reduced to the one-inch scale, which is the scale adopted for the gene-

ral Geological jSlap of the countrj'. In addition to that general map, however,

maps on tlie larger or six-inch are published of all mineral tracts. In this way
five sheets of the six-inch maps have now been published, embracing the whole of

the coal-fields of Fife, Haddingtonshire, and Edinburghshire, with a large portion

of the coal-fields of Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, Ayrshire, and Dumfriesshire.

The area over which the field-work of the Survey has extended lies between the

mouths of the Firths of Tay, Forth, Clyde, and Solway, eastwards to the borders

of Roxburghshire and the mouth of the Tweed. It includes the counties of Fife,

Kinross, the Lothians, Lanark, Renfrew, Peebles, Ayr, Wigton, Kirkcudbright,

Dumfries, and Selkirk, with parts of Stirling, Dumljarton, and Perth.

Of the geological formations examined, the Lower Silurian rocks of the southern

uplands cover a considerable space upon the published maps. LTntil three years

ago the mapping of tliese rocks continued to be most unsatisfactory, owing to the

want of any continuous recognizable section from which the order of succession

among the strata could be ascertained, and to tlie great scarcity of organic remains.

Our more recent work among the Leadhills, however, has at last given us the means

of imravelling, as we hope, the physical structure and stratigraphical relations of

the uplands of the south of Scotland. The rocks there are capable of division into

several well-marked groups of strata, characterized by distinct assemblages of fos-
Wesils.
         have a lower or Llandeilo series, with a suite of graptolites, and forming

probably an upper part of the Moftat group, and a higher or Caradoc set of beds,

with a considerable assemblage of distinctive fossils. This higher gi-oup we be-

lieve to be on the same general horizon as the limestones of Wrae and Kilbucho in

Peeblesshire.

   The Lower Old Red Sandstone has now been mapped completely over the whole

of its extent between Edinburgh and the south of Ayrshire, f'ossils have only
                         TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                   97

been met with at one locality in the latter county, where Cephalaspis occurs.
The most characteristic feature of the formation is the enormous development of
its interbedded volcanic rocks. Between Edinburgh and Lanariishire, also, there

occurs in this formation a local but violent imconformability, connected probably

with some phase of the contemporaneous volcanic activity of the region.

Most of the detailed work of the Sm-vey has lain upon Carboniferous rocks. In

the lowest formations of this system, known as the Calciferous Sandstones, the
Survey has now been able to trace a twofold division completely across the coun-

try, from sea to sea, viz. a lower group of red sandstones, and a higher group of

white sandstones, gi-een, grey, and dark shales, cement-stones, limestones, and occa-

sional coal-seams. All these strata lie beneath the true Carboniferous Limestone.

Thej'' are becoming daily more important from their containing in some places
highly bituminous shales, from which paraffin oil can be made. The Carboniferous

Limestone series, with its valuable coals and ironstones, has been mapped, and in

great part published, for the eastern and south-western coal-fields ; and this is also

the case with the Coal-measures. Much additional information has been obtained

regarding the development of volcanic action in central Scotland during the Car-

boniferous period.

   The Permian basins of Ayrshire and Thornhill have been surveyed and in great

part published. Much fresh light has in the course of this Survey been thrown on

the interesting Permian volcanoes of the south-west of Scotland.

   Attention has been continuously given to the superficial accumulations. These

are now mapped in as great detail as the rocks underneath, and plans are being

prepared with the view to an issue of maps of the surface geology.
   Bj^ a recent order of the Director-General, each one-inch map is now accompa-

nied at the time of its publication, or as soon thereafter as possible, with an expla-

natory pamphlet, in which the fonn of the ground, geological formations, fossils,

rocks, faults, and economic minerals are brieny described, and such further infor-

mation given as seems necessary for the proper elucidation of the map. These

pamphlets are sold at a uniform price of hd. Detailed vertical sections are pub-

lished for each coal-field. For the construction of these sections, records of

boring operations are procured and recorded in the register-books of the Survey.

Since 1867 more than 312,200 feet of such borings have in this way been entered

in cm" books. Sheets of horizontal sections on a large scale are likewise issued to
form, with the maps and explanations, a compendium of the geological structure

of each large district.

Another feature of the work of the Survey is the collection of specimens of the

myrocks and fossils of each tract of country as it is surveyed. Since    previous

Report to this Section of the British Association, we have collected 1011 speci-

mens of rocks, and 7500 fossils. These are named and exhibited, as far as the

present accommodation will permit, in the Museum of Science and Art at Edin-

burgh.

The work of the Geological Survey is can-ied on, as I have said, under the guid-

ance of its Director-General, Sir Roderick Murchison, a name which has long been

a household word at the meetings of the British Association, and one to which I

am sure you will permit me to make on this occasion more than a passing reference.

While the Survey advances, as I have shown, steadily over the face of the country,

imravelling piece by piece the complicated details of its geological structure, to

Sir Roderick belongs the rare merit of having himself led the way, by sketching
for us, boldly and clearly, the relations of the older rocks over more tlian half of

the kingdom. Much must undoubtedly remain for future investigation, but his out-
line of the grand essential features of Highland geology will ever remain as a monu-
ment of his powers of close yet rapid observation aud sagacious inference. At one

time I had hoped that the Chair of this Section might be filled by him, and that
we should be permitted to listen anew to his expositions of the rocks of his native
countrj'. There is no one among us who does not regret the absence of the fami-

liar face and voice of the veteran of Siluria. AVe meet once more on Scottish

ground, aud for the first time we have not here with us the man who has laid a

deeper, broader impress on Scottish geology than any other geologist either of past

generations or of this. There is, however, on the present occasion, a special cause

FossUiferous Strata at Loehend near Edhiburgli By D. Gkieve.

The strata to which this notice refers are situated on the east side of the Loch,

and appear in the Trap precipice, on which stand the ruins of the ancient Keep of

the Logans of Eestalrig. ^Vlthough it was conjectured, it was not known, imtil

Mr. Grieve found distiuctive fossils in these strata, that the Carboniferous forma-

tion, so largely spread over the site of Edinburgh and its neighbourhood, extended

so far to the  eastward                                             and  it would  now appear that these  form a continuity of
                                                                 ;

the strata and shales found some years ago on the north side of the Calton Hill.

They are of the Loxccr Carboniferous formation, and seem to be equivalents of the

sandstones and shales of Burdiehouse on the south, and "NVardie and Granton on

the north and west of Edinburgh.

 --The fossils found hy Mr. Grieve at Loehend he enumerates as follows : Of

Plants, Calamites of a large and well-marked species, a Lepidodendron and Lepi-

dophyllum, with various Sphenopterites. Of Fishes, a beautiful specimeaa of the

genus PaI(Fonisciis ; also scales, teeth, spines, and coprolites. Lastly, a Crustacean,

Cypris Scoto Biirdiyalensis, or of an allied species.

It is to be regretted that the quany from which the above fossils were obtained

has now been obliterated in the course of agiicultural improvements.

On the position of Oryanic Remains near Burntisland. By G, J. Geiete.

On "The Boidder Drift and Esker Hills of Ireland,'" and " On the position of
  Erratic Bloclcs in the Country." By Sir RicnAED Gkiffith, Bart.,F.R.S.

   Sir Ilich.ard commenced by giving a short description of his geological map, and
mentioned that the direction of the mountain-ranges generally, as well as the stiike

of the strata, ranged from north-west to south-east. He stated that the position

of Ireland with respect to Europe was further to the west into the Atlantic Ocean,
and that on the west side were numerous deep bays, guarded by promontories
composed of hard rocks, while on tlie east side the coast was only slightlj' indented

on any part. He mentioned that the coast of Ireland all round was composed of

mountains, while the interior was nearly flat, and that the rock of that plain was

altogether composed of Carboniferous limestone. He stated that a line drawn from
Sligo Bay on the west to Drogheda Bay on the east, woidd form the northern

boundary of the great plain, while the southern boundary might be shown by a
line drawn from Galway Bay on the west to Dublin Bay on the east, comprehend-
ing an area of 5000 square miles. This large district was divided into nearly two
equal parts by the river Shannon, whose source was near Lough Allen, in the
county of Cavan, elevated 160 feet above the level of the sea, while the length of

its course to the sea, at Limerick, was 140 miles, giving an average fall of 1 foot
2 inches in a mile; and he further stated that this fall was not equally dis-
tributed, as between Limerick and Kildare, a distance of 12 miles, was a fall of
98 feet, showing that from the distance of 128 miles between Lough Allen and
Killaloe, there was an average faU of less than G inches in a mile. The great

centi-e plain, ah-eady described as containing 5000 square miles, contained 1,000,000
acres of bogs, each of which was surrounded by diift resting on the top of the

Carboniferous limestone, and it usually presented an vuidulating surface wliicli

occasionally affected the form of elongated elliptical liills, which usually ran

parallel to each other. This fact was especially exemplified by Clew Bay, situated

on the west coast, in which were upwards of 300 islands, the surface of which

was composed of boulder-drift resting on Carboniferous limestone. He mentioned

that at least on the eastern the boulder drift had a thickness of about 100 feet, but

probably was much thicker towards the west. He described the boulder-drift as

composed of a base of sandy or gravellj^ clay, which contained numerous rolled

masses, huddled together in a confused manner without reference to size, and that

their dimensions ranged between those of a small egg and two or three cubic feet iu

diameter. He next adverted to those remarkable ranges of hill, which varied in height

above the surface of the boulder-drift from twenty to sixty feet, the ascent being

usually about thirty degrees on the west side, but less steep on the east. These
Esker hills were very numerous in the midland plain, especially in the coimties of

Mayo, Galway, and Roscommon, on the west side of the Shannon, and of the King's
County and Westmeath on the east. Their general direction was from west to

east ; and one great Esker, which extended from west to east from the county of
Galway to Westmeath, was used as the post road from Dublin to Galway, for a

length of 30 miles. This great Esker crossed the river Shannon at Athlone, and
was subsequently cut through by it, exhibiting a great shoal at the present time,

on which the old bridge of Athlone was built. On the western side, about 50 feet

above the river, an ancient fort had been erected to defend the passage, and this
fort still remained in perfect preservation. The town of Athlone was also built
on the east side of it, and extended from thence nearly 20 miles. Fifteen miles to
the south of Athlone, the river Shannon was crossed again by another Esker, also
running from west to east, and in this place the Esker presented very steep

acclivities on either side. He last described a very remarkable Esker called the

" Horseshoe," from its form, the north arm of which running eastward extended
for 10 miles, whilst the southern extended 8 miles, leaving an opening of 8 miles,
with the town of Clara in the centre. The slopes of these horseshoe Eskers on
the west side were steep, ha\'ing an angle of about 30°, while on the outer side the
slope was only fi-om 10 to 15°. Having mentioned that in many cases Eskera
were observed, particularly to the west of Athlone, having- a north and south
direction, he gave it as his opinion that the Eskers were deposited on the top of
the boulder-drift at a subsequent period, and that the materials, which were
similar to the boulder-drift, with the exception of the admixtiu'e of sandy clay
matter, were deposited from currents and waves in a shallow troubled sea, and
possibly did not owe their existence to glacial action. Sir Richard next directed

the attention of the Section to the occun-ence of large erratic blocks, totally uncon-
nected with the gi-avel, which were found resting on the sm-face throuo-'hout the

entire district, from Galway Bay in an eastern and southei'n direction, passing over
the summits of the Sli eve-bloom mountains, near Roscrea, and extending from
thence through the King's and Queen's counties. These blocks were all composed

of a peculiar porphyritic granite fi'om the district situated to the north of Galway
Bay. This granite was composed of red and white felspar, gTey quartz and black
mica, and contained numerous crystals of red felspar, which rendered the appear-

ance so peculiar that no dotibt could be entertained that the granite blocks ju)ove

mentioned were derived from the Galway district.

   These blocks are usually angular though occasionally slightly rounded. One,
whose dimensions was 10' by 5' by 3', equal to 4 tons in weight, is described by

Mr. Joseph O'Kelly, of the Geological Survey of Ireland, as resting on Lower
SUurian gi-oimd, 10 miles to the north of the Town of Roscrea, at an elevation
exceeding 1000 feet above the sea ; and his colleague, Mr. G. Henry Kinahan, the
senior geologist, found great numbers of these blocks scattered over the limestone

plain, in the neighbourhood of Atheniy, to the east of Galway. He likewise

described large blocks of the same granite in the valley of Glensascaul, at the
western base of the Slieve-bloom mountains, the dimensions of one of which was
12' by 10' by 11', equal to 110 in weight, and others whose weight varied from
3.5 to 48 tons.

    Sir Richard next alluded to auother di-Ift of erratic blocks, which took a course
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

fronisontli to north, crossing- the Curlew and Ox mountains in the county of Sligo,

the direction of each being from north-east to south-west.
   The Curlew mountains consist of brown sandstone belonging to the Upper Silurian

series, the surface being elevated above 800 feet above the level of the sea.
Descending the mountains to the north, to the limestone vaUey of Tobercurry,

which occurs between them and the Ox mountains, we find the surface with very

large boulders of brown sandstone ; and continuing to tlie northward the ascent of

the Ox mountains, which are composed of mica-slate, we find the boulders of
brown sandstone continued, though diminished in size. On reaching tlie height
of 450 feet above the limestone valley, we meet with limestone Eskers having an

east and west direction, crossing the mountain valley at right angles, and on top
of which numerous angular blocks of mica-slate rest ; but the mica-slate is inter-
mixed with gravel, which is composed altogether of clean rolled masses of Carbo-

niferous limestone. Milan Mountain, one of the Ox range, the summit of which is

elevated to the height of 1446 feet above the sea, is composed of granite, forming
part of a large protrusion through the mica-slate, which is metamorphosed near

the contact.

   This gi-anite is large-grained, and is composed of red and white felspar, grey
quartz, and black mica, but without any crystals of red felspar such as occur in
the Galway granite.

   Descending the mountains to the north, we reach the Easky Lough, elevated
700 feet above the sea. Here the granite is bounded by mica-slate, which continues
to the base of the declivity, and we find the surface covered by blocks of granite

and continuing still further across the limestone plain to the sea-coast, to Easky

village, a distance of 8 miles, we find the surface also covered by very large blocks

of granite ; and one in particular, which is situated within half a mile of the sea-
shore, and near to Easky village, was, on measurement, found to contain 13G0
cubic feet, equal to 100 tons in weight.

   Similar granite blocks occur on the surface of the whole line of the north coast
of Sligo and Mayo, all of which are similar in composition to the Easky granite, as

well as to that which occurs on the summit of the Ox mountains to the west of
Easlcy Lough as far as the town of Foxford ; and no doubt can be entertained that

such must have been transported by ice.

On the Ar/ency of the Alternate Elevation and Subsidence of tlie Land in the
   formation of Boidder-clai/s and Glaciers, and the Excavation of Vallei/s
   and Bays. By the Eev. Johx Gunx.

   Mr. Gunn briefly recapitulated the contents of a paper which he read at the

Meeting of the British Association at Liverpool, to the eifect that boulder-clays
were deposited in a temperate rather than in a glacial period, inasmuch as the
area of the sea was increased by the subsidence of the land ; the perpetual snow-
line must have been lowered, masses of ice disengaged, icebergs set floating and
the boulder-clays formed ; that the glacial epoch was due to the elevation of

mountain-ranges and consequent glaciers. He proceeded to show that, in some

instances which he specified, the agency of the alternate elevation and depression
of the land in scooping out valleys and gorges where there was no evidence of ice
action might be traced ; that such effects were due to the action of shallow seas,
either while clearing oil', or while gathering over the surface of the land, and cutting

out with its incessant surge water-worn channels and inland bays. He stated, in

conclusion, his opinion that there was no occasion to invoke any additional causes
of change of climatiire besides those which were kno^vn to exist ; but the question
which remains to be soh'ed is, to what cause are these alternate oscillations of
level due ?

       0)1 {he Age of the Fehtones ami Conglomerates of the Pentland Hills.

         By John Henderson, F.G.S.E., read hy D. J. Broavw, F.G.S.E.

    This paper was illustrated by two sections, and specimens of rocks and fossils
 were exhibited.

    The felstones of the Pentland Hills, with their contemporaneous conglomerates
and sandstones, have hitherto been considered of Old Red Sandstone age, by Mur-
chison, McLaren, Geikie, and others. Having frequently examined the various
exposed sections throughout the district, and from the evidence collected, the author
endeavom'ed to prove that some of these felstones, conglomerates, and sandstones
are as new as the upper portion of the Lower Carboniferous.

   The first section referred to may be seen on the north-west side of the hills

at Clubbiedean, where beds of Carboniferous sandstone and shales, containing
Sphenopteris affinis and other well-known Carboniferous fossils, are ruptured, tilted
and hardened by the intrusion of the felstones ; and these intrusive felstones enclose
fragments of hardened shales and limestones, yielding encrinites belonging to these
beds, showing conclusively that these felstones are of a more recent age than the
overlying carboniferous. The other section referred to occurs about four miles further

to the south-west, at Bevelau and Plabbies How, where these supposed Old Red
Sandstones and Conglomerates may be seen resting on the upturned edges of the

Silurian rocks. In these Silurian rocks the author detected a number of felstone
dykes, one of which is about 30 feet broad, and may be traced iip the face of
Ilarehill, a distance of about 300 feet, where it is covered by horizontal beds of

--sandstoue^the supposed Old Red which it does not penetrate, while in the val«

ley to the south of Ilarehill some limestone pebbles were found enclosed in the con-
glomerates, which contain fossils evidently of Carboniferous age, such as Serpnda

paraUela, Sec, showing that these sandstones and conglomerates cannot be of Old

Red age as hitherto supposed.
   Now, when it is considered that the Lower Carboniferous rocks in this dis-

trict are everj'where broken up by intrusive felstones and greenstones, while the

sandstones and conglomerates of Ilarehill and the Cairnhills remain almost un-

touched by igneous action, and lying nearly horizontal and undisturbed, the na-

tural conclusion arrived at is, that these supposed Old Red Sandstones were not
deposited until after the igneous forces which have disturbed the Lower Carboni-

ferous in this district were nearly exhausted ; and the whole evidence clearly shows

that these supposed Old Red Sandstones, Conglomerates, and Felstones of this part
of the Pentland Hills must at least be as recent as the upper part of the Lower

Carboniferous.

   Having referred to the bold and interesting physical features of the district,
which in some respects resemble those of Arran, and which had already been ob-
jects of investigation by Griffith*, Bergert, and Brj-ce J, the authors observed
that there were, as iuArrau itself, two varieties of granite. These had been
shown by the Rev. Professor Haughton§ to differ in composition; the gi-anite of
Slieve Croob (consisting of quartz, orthoclase and mica) being a " soda gi-anite,"
and that of Mourne (consisting of quartz, orthoclase, albite, and mica) being a
" potash granite." l)r. Bryce had expressed an opinion that these two granites

belong to different epochs ||'

   The relative and (as far as possible) the actual aoes of these granites still re-
mained to be determined, and in the absence of stratified deposits newer than the

Lower Silurian in immediate contact with the granites themselves, the authors
beUeved that conclusions might be safely arrived at by considerations connected
with the basaltic and felspathic dykes by which the rocks had on several occasions

been invaded.
   They had arrived at the conclusion that the granite of Mourne was more recent

than that of Slieve Croob by a long interval of geological time ; the former being
of Upper Palffiozoic, the latter of, perhaps, Mesozoic age. These general conclu-
sions were supported by the following considerations.

   The granite of Mourne at its margin in some places passes into quartziferous
porphyry, and sends ofishoots of this rock in the form of dykes into tlje surromid-
ing Silurian strata, as may be very clearly determined by several examples in the
vicinitv of Newcastle. Hence the authors inferred that the dykes of quartz-por-
phyi-y'and felstone which traverse the granite of Slieve Croob might be referred

to "the age of the newer granite of Moiu-ne ; and thus the greater antiquity of the

--Slieve Croob gi-anite might be determined.
    Trap-dykes Tlie trap-rocks of the district were classed mineralogically as

--follows: (a) Quartz-porphyries and highly silicated felstones. (6) Diorites. (c)

Basalts or Dolerites of two ages.
   Considered with reference to relative ages of foimation, the following was the

--order of succession, in the ascending series.
   (1) Older Bdscdts and Dolerite Dykes. These form by far the most numerous
of all the ti'ap-rocks of the district, occurring in gi-eat numbers along the coast

south of Newcastle, and amongst the interior mountains, as at Slieve Muck ; they

ai'e also unquestionably the oldest of all the trap-rocks of the district.

   Their age, with reference to the granite of Mourne, was placed beyond question
by a large number of examples in which these dykes, after traversing the Silurian
rocks, are abruptly terminated at the margin of the granite ; they are therefore
older than the gi'anite itself*. These older basalts were found to traverse the Silu-
rian rocks in well-formed dykes within vertical (or nearly vertical) walls, and are
generally fine-grained, of dark gi-een colour, imdistinguishable from those of newer
Tertiary age. Sliced specimens showed under the microscope the composition to

be augite, triclinic felspar, and titauo-f errite.
   (2) The next in order of age are the quartz-porphyries and felstones, which (as

already stated) branch ofi' from the main mass of the Mourne granite, and are un-
questionably of the same age as the granite itself, and often strongly resemble it
in its more compact form. Dylves of these rocks are also found traversing the
older gi-auite of Slieve Croob. They consist of a felspathic base vrith crystals of
felspar, gi-ains and crystals of quartz, and sometimes mica or hornblende, as acces-
sories, and in small quantities.

   (3) The Diorite djkes are few in number, the finest example occm-ring at Bos-
trevor. It consists of a crjstalline gi-anular aggregate of reddish felspar and horn-
blende well developed, and traverses the older basaltic dykes ; but is, they beUeve,
older than the granite of Momiie. It is therefore referable to some intermediate

period.

(4) Besides the older basaltic dykes, which are cut off" by the granite, tliere are

a few which traverse both the Silurian rocks and the gi-anite of ]Moume itself.

These are therefore newer than those previously described ; and as they appear to

be connected with those which are found traversing the Cretaceous rocks in Co.

Antrim, the authors consider them to be of Miocene age.

In general aspect there is no decided diflference between the older and newer

basaltic dykes ; they have all the external appearance of the Tertiary dykes, which

aboimd along the margin of the basaltic plateau of Anti-im, and "in the West of

Scotland                                             and had it not been for their relations with the granite of Mom'ne, they

distinction in the basalts of these geological ages ; but recent investigations by
Zirkel, D. Forbes, Allport, and others tend to show that there is no criterion of

age amongst the constituents of basalt, dolerite, or melaphyi-e ; and the presence

of oliyine, once supposed to be distinctive of Tertiary basalts, has been detected

amongst those even of Carboniferous age *.

 --Age of the Older Basalt. The geological age of these older basalts can only be

relatively determined. They are newer than the Lower Carboniferous rocks, which

they are seen to traverse at Cranfield' Point and Carlingford. Recollecting the

abundant evidences of contemporaneous volcanic action which the Carboniferous

rocks of Scotland'and portions of central England present, the authors are disposed

to refer these older basalts to the Upper Carboniferous period itself; and bavin o-

regard to the prodigious number of these dykes traversing the rocks at intervals
along the coast from Dundrum Bay to Carlingford Bay, they suggest the former

existence of one or more volcanic vents in their vicinity during later Carboniferous

times; such a volcanic focus as is inferred to ha^e existed in the vicinity of Car-
lingford by Professor Haughton f.

(<') Newer Basalts of Miocene (Tertiary) age.

Judging by the comparative scarceness of the newer Tertiary dykes in the district

of Mourne, the authors drew the conclusion, that it may be considered as the

southern limit of the region affected by the volcanic outbm-st of the Miocene period,

which so powerfully affected the district lying to the north-east of Ireland and

extending into the Inner Hebrides ; while on the other hand it was the seat of

active volcanic energy during an earlier period, which in all probability may be

identified with the Upper Carboniferous, or that of the Upper Coal-measm'es of

England.

between the granite of Mourne and that of ICirkcudbrightshire, wliich is referable to this

period. Against this view it is to be observed that it would bring the older basaltic dykes

ulose upon the heels of the Mourne granite, winch seems rather improbable.

104 REPORT 1871.

   The Hawick and Selkirk rocks fill up all the central portion of the district de-
scribed, extending from near Selkirk to Mosspaul. They form the great anticline
of the South Scottish Silurians, and appear to be the lowest rocks exhibited. Thoy
contain a few fossils, such as Annelida, Protichnitcs, Protovirgularia, PJii/llopoda.

   The Moffiit series is remarkable for the bed (or beds) of anthracitic shale which it
contains, and which is famous for the large number of Graptohtes foimd in it. The
Moffat series, with its black shale-band, makes its appearance twice in the district

--described, 1st, in the country between Selkirk and Melrose ; 2nd, in the region of

the Moorfoot Hills ; these beds yield fossils of the genera Dicellof/rapsus, Uicrano-
[/rapsus, Cladof/rapsus, Climacoyrcqjsus, Discinocaris, Peltocaris, Siplwnotreta, Lin-

(jula.

   The Gala gi-oup lies in the syncline formed by these two appearances of the
IMoftiit series, and consists of grits, sandstones, shales, and conglomerates, that im-
bed a Middle Silurian fauna, including Monoyrapsus, Diploi/rapsus, RctioUtcs, Die-

tyunema, Apti/cfiojysis, Ceratiocans, Didyocaris, Orthoceras.

   The Eiccarton beds fill up all the Silurian country to the south of a line drawn
from Ku'kcudbright to Jedbm-gh. The fossils are Upper Silurian, and include Cyr-

toyrapsus, Ptiloyrapstis, Thecn, Ortlioceras, Ceraiiocaris, Aptycliopsis, Ptcryyotus,
Phynchonella.

   The authors believe that the anthracitic bed of Moffat is of Bala age, that the
Gala gi-oup contains strata of both Caradoc and Llandovery age, and that the
Eiccarton beds should be classed with the Wenlock or Lower Ludlow.

rally studied, that theory would not appear startling. lie had considered the objec-
tions of Bischof and others to chemical theories, and he believed that they did not hit
the explanation he proposed. That explanation attributes the force of volcanic action

--to solar energy, stored up in rocks by buried organic matter this organic matter

either existing in rocks as carbon and carbonaceous compounds, or represented by
sulphides and other substances, produced by the reducing-action of organic matter.

Volcanoes, as has been said of steam-engines, are worked by " the light of other days."
Starting from the five groups of well-preserved extinct volcanoes in Spain and Por-

tugal, proceeding to consider the volcanoes of the Mediterranean basin, and finally

volcanoes in general, the author concluded that, as had been pointed out by Steny
Hunt, volcanoes, as a rule, lie on or at the border* of much sedimentaiy rock ; and
the exceptions to this rule he considered to be explicable in conformity with his
theory. These sedimentary rocks, especially in the Mediterranean basin and under
the volcanoes of Catalonia, could be said to contain much organic matter. Next
he examined the alleged fact of the occurrence of volcanoes along great lines of
fissure, and concluded that their occurrence in lines was due to their connexion with

the sea, as well as with lines of sedimentary deposition. The author believes that

the sometimes alleged identity of volcanic rocks was a statement either misleadino- or

meaningless, and that the composition of volcanic rocks was just what we sho^uld

expect, if they were formed from masses of sedimentary rocks, in presence of sea-
water. Proceeding to the consideration of the results of Fouque, Deville, Daubeny,
and others, regarding the gaseous products of volcanoes, he showed that these afforded

striking evidence that a mixture of gases, similar to that evolved in gasworks, was
oxidated in volcanoes with production of great heat. To this heat, and to the
burning of separated_ carbon, sulphur, and probably iron, he attributed the hio-h

temperature present in some lava on its appearance in tlie air. From the researches

of Sorby, Zirkel, Daubree, Delesse, Stoppani, and others on the subject of lavas, he
concluded that these were formed at moderate temperatures, and only exceptionally
fused by the great heat produced in the crater. The enormous amount of heat
assumed to be present in volcanic action was, in the author's opinion, in great part
mythical, and what was actually ascertained could be explained by the nature ofthe

substances oxidating in the earth and burning at the crater. As to the introduction of

air and water, he referred to the penetration of sea- water at Cephalonia, to the re-

searches of Delesse, to the Catalan trompe, and to the fact that sea- water dissolves

much o-xygen; while the nitrogen evolved, in volcanic areas and elsewhere, is

usually either pure or accompanied by less oxj-gen than would compose atmo-

spheric air. He then pointed out that the amount of carbon found in rocks might

be adequate to produce all the heat required, if we assumed the rocks to have been

rapidly  deposited                                                    whereas,  if they  had  been  slowly  deposited,  the  amount of car-
                                                                  ;_

bon now existing in them could only be a remaining fraction of that they formerly

contained, the rest having been evolved as carbonic acid. If he were to reject geolo-

gical time, as some have done, he might assume that the volcanic heat to be accounted

for was j list as much as the average amount of carbon was adequate to supplj-. After

attributing the origin ofthe vast amount of buried carbon now in rocks to buiied car-

bon in former rocks, and remarking that it must have passed very gradually throuo-h

the atmosphere, he discussed some correlated processes in nature which would keep

volcanic action roughly uniform, the sun-force continually passing through oroanic

matter into volcanic heat. He confined himself chiefly to volcanic action'^proper as

that was generally considered the best evidence of the original-heat theory ; but he

considered that such general internal heat as had been ascertained might be attri-

buted to the distribution of volcanic heat by water, to general oxidation of the car-

bon ahnost universal in rocks, to friction as shown by Bianconi, and finally, to the

electric currents ascertained to exist in the earth, and to be probably produced in

great part by the sun.

   The paper was illustrated by sketches taken by the writer in the Two Sicilies,

the Greek Isles, Catalonia, &c., also by some curious specimens of metamorohosed
gla.5s, which he had found while excavating for antiquities in Ischia.

             FurtJier Experiments and Remarks on Contortion of Bochs.

                                     By L. C. MiAiL.

   After recapitulating the results of some experiments on contortion of mountain
limestone brought before the Association at Exeter, the author went on to state that
with improved apparatus he had extended his experiments to various substances.
Limestone appeared to be exceedingly plastic when long subjected to forces of low
intensity. Flagstones fi-om the Coal-measures with a certain amount of elasticity
possessed little power of permanent deflection. This negative result is, however,
to be checked by observation of cases of accidental flexm-e of flagstones. Examples
were cited of these rocks which had yielded to strains, and had become perma-
nently bent. Plaster of Paris the author finds remarkably plastic, and a long
series of experiments with dry slabs shows that it can be bent and twisted inde-

Afinitely. Slates had also been tested, but with quite inconspicuous results.

considerable elasticitjr was found to characterize good slate, -with a quite inappre-
ciable plasticity. The author had obtained striking examples of artificial contor-
tion by imbedding laminse of various rocks in pitch. These residts were applied
to the very sharp flexures sometimes seen in hard strata lying in beds of shale.
Cases of quite superficial contortion were quoted, and from numerous instances
of marked undulations in sti-ata which were underlain by horizontal and undis-
tm-bed layers, it was inferred that many contortions extend only to trifling depths.

A case of contortion traceable to the removal of part of a hill-side by a landslip
was referred to as showing that flexures on a considerable scale may be of quite

recent origin. In conclusion, some remarks were made on the general theory of

contoi-tious at the surface of the earth.

   On the so-called Hyoid plate of the Asterolcpis of the Old Bed Sandstone.
                                By j0H3f MiLLEK, F.G.S.

   In the Number of the ' Geological Jom-nal ' for August 1869, the author pub-
lished a letter, stating that he had obtained two specimens of the Aderolepis from
the great flag-deposits of Caithness, which showed clearly and distinctly that what

had hitherto been considered to be the hyoid plate was not a hyoid plate at all, but
was in reaUty the dorsal plate of the Asterolejns, fitting on immediately behind the

cranial buckler, pretty much in the same way as the dorsal plate of the Cuccostciis
fitted on behind its 'head-plates. He stated tliat he would endeavour to lay his
specimens before the Geological Society of London as soon as possible ; however,
circumstances have prevented this. The specimens referred to were exhibited

on the present occasion, in fulfilment of the pledge given to the Geological

 Societ)'.

    It is right to premise that from the time these plates were first made known to
geologists by Asmus and Eichwald in Eussia, and by Sir Eoderick Murchison and

 Agassiz in the west of Europe, they have been regarded in Russia and in this

country as hyoid plates, down to the period of the publication by Pander of his
works on the Devonian sj'stem of llussia, in which he stated his opinion that they
would turn out to be dorsal plates when more complete fossils turned up. This
 opinion was shared in by several of our most eminent palaeontologists, and amongst
others by INIi'. Peach, who has long worked in the Asfrolepts-heis of Caithness, and

it was the author's object to sho-w that the generally received opinion on the

subject is a mistake, audf that the plate in question is in reality a true dorsal plate,
fitting on immediately behind the cranial buckler or head-plates, and that those

naturalists who had previously supposed that this would ultimately prove to be its
right position, from Pander down to Peach, were found to have been quite correct

in their opinion. The author exhibited a sketch of his best specimen, in which was

seen the upper surface of the cranial buckler, described by Hugh Miller, with the

dorsal plate, in its true position, and attached to the cranial buckler by two " massive
bones of very peculiar shape," alluded to in the quotation above.

            Conservation of Boulders. By D. Milne-Home, F.B.S.E.

    Professor Geikie having stated that the next subject to be brought under the
notice of the Section was the conservation of remarkable boulders, begged to men-
tion that the Sectional Committee had passed a resolution, intimating their sense
of the importance of the subject, and recommending that the British Association

should appoint a Committee, with a grant of money at its disposal, to endeavour to

discover the position of remarkable boulders in anj part of the United Kingdom,
and also to have them preserved. The Royal Society of Edinburgh had already

taken steps for these objects as regards Scotland ; and it would be weU to have the
movement extended so as to embrace England and Ireland; and the two Committees
would no doubt cooperate, as far as Scotland was concerned. He then called

on Mr. Milne-Home, the Chairman of the Committee of the Royal Society of
Edinburgh, to explain more particularly the objects contemplated, and the measures
which might be taken to carry them out.

   Mr. Slilne-Honie said that his attention to the subject had fir.st been awakened
by an article in ' Nature,' from the pen of their President, Professor Geikie, giving
an account of proceedings which had been commenced in Switzerland for the pre-

servation of remarkable boulders. Being acquainted with Professor Favre, of
Geneva, he had learned from him that the movement embraced Dauphiny and
other provinces in the South of France, and that the effect had been to create a
strong popular sjTupathy in the object. Following this precedent, he had induced
the Royal Society of Edinburgh to appoint a Committee, whose duty it was to send

circulars to all the parishes in Scotland, with the view of ascertaining the existence

in them of any boulders remarkable for size or for other features. Many questions
of much geological interest could be solved by ascertaining the nature of the rocks

composing boulders, and studying their shapes, in order to deduce conclusions as to
the transporting agent. These boulders, however, were fast disappearing, some-

times owmg to agricultural improvements, and sometimes affording, when broken

up, materials for building or for road-metal. It was therefore important to
discover the localities where any remarkable boulders existed, in order that they

might be examined by those who took an interest in such speculations, and in
order also to liave them preserved. He had reason to believe that the proprietors

and tenants of the lands on which such boulders might be situated would willingly
accede to any application which might be made to them by scientific societies to

preserve them. He was sure that, were this Section to express views favourable

to that object, great good would result.

   The author remarked that the district in which he lived consisted geologically

of the Carboniferous and of the New Red or Cheshire sandstone systems" that

the inhabitants of the former were engaged in mining and agricultm-e, and those

of the latter in agriculture chiefly.                                                                                                                                                        Ansemia, with goitre, was very prevalent

former tlian tlie latter. As anosmia was a state iu -u-liicli there was a deficiency in
the oxide of iron iu the blood, he was led to examine chemically the relative com-
position of wheat grown upon a soil of Cheshire sandstone, carhouiferous lime-

stone, millstone giit, and a transition soil between the Cheshire sandstone and the
grit ; and the analysis showed that wheat grown upon Cheshire sandstone yielded

the largest quantity of ash, and that it contained a much larger quantity of phos-
phoric acid and oxide of iron than that gi-own upon the other formations. He cal-
cidated that a dweller on the Cheshire sandstone who consumed 1 lb. of wheat
daily, grown upon the latter formation, took in nearly live grains more per day of
oxide of iron than one who dwelt on the Carboniferous system who did the same.
The analysis showed also that the wheat growu upon the Carboniferous system was
deficient in phosphates or nutritive salts ; and one who consumed a pound of
Cheshire wheat per day took in nine grains more of phosphoric acid than one who

took one pound of wheat gro-s\Ti upon the Carboniferous system. He had endea-
voured to ascertain whether the bread of those who dwelt upon the two sj'stoms

was relatively as deficient in these important nutriti\e elements as the wheat

grown upon them. He had collected twenty samples of bread used by twenty dif-

ferent families living upon each system, and analysis aftbrded results as conclusive
as the examination of the wheat. The deficiency of the nutritive salts iu the bread
compared with those in the wheat was very remarkable ; and it was no doubt
owiug to the removal of the bran from the flour with which the bread was made.

The ·s\Titer then gave some statistics as to the diseases prevalent iu the counties of
Chester, Flint, and Denbigh, and stated that the practical deductions to be di'a-w-n
from the inquiry were, that all young persons living on a Cai-bouiferous formation
having SA'mptoms of iucipient goitre and antemia, ought to be moved to a soil upon

Red Sandstone, and persons of strumous habit ought to reside upon sandstone at

an elevation of at least 800 or 1000 feet above the sea ; and that both classes of
persons should live upon food, both animal aud farinaceous, which contained the

maximum quantity of oxide of iron and the phosphates or nutritive salts. Medi-
cal men could not too much impress upon the minds of the public the importance
of using flour made from the whole of the wheat; or " whole gi-ain."'

    On the Systematic Position of Sivatherium gigantcum, Faulc. and C'aut*.

                      By Dr. James Mtjeie, F.G.S., F.L.S., ^c.

    Among the fossil fauna discovered in the Sewalik Hills, the Sivatherium, one of

these, as attested by its remains, must have attained the size of a full-grown ele-

phant. It appears, however, to have been a ruminant, iu some respects Deer-

like, in others more resembling the Antelope. Still stranger, it seems to have

--had some characteristic features of Pachyderms the Tapir, for example. After a

careful review of the statements and deductions that have been made upon the

Sivcttheriiim, the author went on to show tliat it belonged to those radical forms

which by some may be regarded as one of the progenitors of diverse herbivorous

groups. The fossil bones studied by him are those contained in the British

Museum. There is also a remarkable fragment in the Edinburgh University

--Museum. The points which he regarded as aflbrding a safe basis of the affinities

of this curious animal are : 1. The form and structure of the horns; 2. the shape

of  the  bones  of  the  face ;  3.  the  nature  of  the  teeth                            4.  the  formation  of the

basis of the skull ; and 5. other peculiarities of the neck, chest, and limb-bones.

The Sivatherimn, according to him, is unlike all other living- ruminants but one,

the Prongbuck, from the fact of its having had hollow horns, evidently subject to

shedding. It differs thus from Deer, whose solid liorns anuuallj' drop off, and from

the Antelope tribe. Sheep, and Oxen, whose hollow horns are persistent. Save

one living form, the Saiga, no recent ruminant possesses, as did the Sivatherium, a

muzzle resembling in several ways the proboscis of the Tapirs and Elephants.

The dentition partook of the characters of the ancient Elasmothcriuin, &c. The

basis and hind end of the skull is typical of oxen. The sternum, portion of tho
spine, and general strength of the limb-bones show configui-ations allying it with
the Bovidaj. Other features of the legs hint an affinity to the Camel. On the
strength of his own researches, and those of Mr. Bartlett and Dr. Canfield, the

author is inclined to place the Sivatherium in the family Antilocapridffl ; Drs. Sclater

and Gray having raised the Prongbuck to a group equivalent to the Cervidse and
Antilopidne, chiefly from the singular fact of its horns being hollow and periodi-
cally deciduous. The great Indian Sivatherium lie considers might as well be

taken as the centre type of a family, the Sivatheridaj. He points out that radi-

ating from it can be traced a differentiation of structure allying it to the ancient
Bramotherium and Megacerops. Diversely, links lead through the Prongbuck

towards the Deer, Giraffe, and Camel. On the other hand, configurations point

undoubtedly to the Saiga ; and there it is, as it were, split into lines directed

towards the Antelope, the Sheep, and even the Pachyderms.

Additions to the list of Fossils and Localities of the Carhoniferous Formation

              in and around Edinhuryh. By C. W. Peach, A.L.S.

   The author, after a few preliminary remarks, stated tliat he had found Spirorhis
carhonarius rather plentiful at Burdiehouse, showing that the limestone there had
been deposited in brackish water ; Estheria, in Camstone quarry, in Arthur's Seat,

plentiful ; Leia in an ironstone nodule at Wardie, Professor R. Jones says, " the

most northern locality at present known ; " Acanthodes 7F«;T/i plentiful in the Par-

rot-coal at Loanhead, rare at the brickworlc and No. 1 Pit and Shield Hill, Fal-
kirk, and in the black -band and gas-coal at Auchenheath, Lesmahagow. In ad-
dition to the well-known Tugopterus of Wardie, he had got from Loanhead splendid
specimens, with large and beautifully carved jaws and striated teeth, for which,
should it prove new, he proposed to name it F. elegans. It is rare.

  He next exhibited a portion of a splendid spine, beautifully tubercled, and covered
as well with thorn-like hoolfs, differing from all figured by Agassiz. He exhibited
other things, probably new ; also a shagreen-covered fish ; he had found it in several

localities. As all were so imperfect he refrained from doing more than showing
them to the members, so that any one knowing it might throw light on it.

   He next exhibited and commented on a series of beautiful specimens of coal-

field plants, consisting of large leaves and stem of Cordaites borassifolia ; Ccdainites
nodosus in a splendid state, showing its pairs of branches, pinnae, and leaves ; from
these he had been able to make nearly a complete restoration of the plant. The
greatest prize was AnthoKthes Pitcainnce, with its fruit Cardiocarpon attached,

hanging gracefully by its swan-like stem ; these, with many other interesting

plants, he got in the blaes above the coal at Coach-road pit, near Falldrk.

   He remarked that some of the jaws and portions of the fishes from the coal-fields
retained their greasy nature, throwing off water when wetted like the chalk used by

lithographers, and instantly drying, whilst the matrix in which they were enclosed
remained wet.

On a New Fish-spine from the Lower Old Bed Sandstone of Hay, Breconshire.
                         By the Rev. W. S. Stmonds, F.O.S.

   This is a new Icthyodorulite now in the possession of the Earl of Emiiskillen. It
is described by Mr. Etheridge, of the School of Mines, under the name of Onchus
major. It is the largest known spine from the Lower Old Red Sandstone.

   The sti-atigraphical position of this Eish-spiue was described to Mr. Symonds by
Mr. John Thomas, C.E., of Ilay, Brecon. It was found at Llidiart-y-Warn quarry,

near Hay. The following is Mr. Thomas's account :--

   "This fossil, with several others, was found by Mr.- David Jones, of Hay, some
three or four years ago, who, not Iniowing its value, left it to lie in his garden on a
rockery. It is much weathered in consequence.

    " Ail geologists acquainted vdth this district will recollect the fine section of Old

Red as seen from the summit of the Black Mountains overlooking the Wye valley,

between Hay and Glasbuiy. In ' Siluria,' p. 272, Sir Roderick Murchison has

given a reduced copy of a section from the outcrop of the Carboniferous Limestone

of the South Wales' basin, across the Wye valley to the Upper Ludlow, in Rad-

norshire. The summit of the Black Mountain is occupied by chocolate-coloured

sandstones, called by Mr. Symonds " Browustones." Then, in descending, we

have the red and green marls and the comstones. The cornstones are very
clearly defined and exposed on the slope of the hills from the Usk valley to Moufle-
 castle, opposite Hay.

    " About 200 feet' below the comstone-beds and at this point is Llidiart-y-Wam
quany, where the fossil was discovered. The beds in the quarry are formed of
cornstone and verj^ fine layers of whitish sandstone."

    The structure of this Fish-spine is thus described by Mr. R. Etheridge, F.R.S. :
    " Form gently arcuated, of nearly equal diameter from base to apex, slightly com-

pressed. Posterior free, concave, destitute of denticles. Sides apparently smooth,
having no ridge or sulci, though it appears to have been originally delicately lined
base of spine round or obtuse, broad, smooth, or delicately striated ; outer sub-
 stance thick, internal axis large, and rugose on outer layer. Length 5 inches,

breadth \ inch. Loc. Llidiart-y-Warn. Position. Cornstone of Lower Old Red

 Sandstone."

    The anterior face of the spine is not seen ; whether it is obtuseh^ keeled or not
 is therefore unknown. The osseous structure and substance is well defined. The
 author doubts not that originall}-, or if we had the outer surface preserved, the spine
 was longitudinally ridged by deep, narrow sulci.

     0»i the later Crag-Deposits of Norfolk and Svffoll:. By J. S. Tatloe.

           On the Stratified JRoels of Islay. By James Thomson, F.G.S.

    The author described briefly the physical conditions of the island of May, then

 in detail the dip, strike, mineral character, and superposition of the stratified rocks,

  in the following order :

     1st. The calcareous deposits in the centre of the island, consisting of limestone,
 talcose shale, clay-slate, and interbedded quartzites, belong to the Lower Silurian
  group. The author remarked that although these calcareous deposits had not yet
  yielded identifiable organic remains, he did not despair, if they were properly in-

vestigated, of finding cliaracteristic forms, which would enable ns to place them
with certainty as the equivalents of the Lower Silurian rocks, so well defined by
Sir Roderick Mm-chison as occurring in Ross and Sutherlandshire.

   2nd. The deposits on the eastern side of the island, and skirting the shore of the
Sound of Islay from Ard-na-huamh on the north to Balleochreoch on the south,
are of Cambrian age. Although the author has not seen the precise equivalents
of the greenish-grey micaceous nags, with the felspathic partings found on the north
side of Big-Free-Port Bay, on which we find sun-cracks, rain-prints, and what some
suppose to be .annelid tracks or bmTOWs, yet they coincide so well with similar
rocks, so very clearly shown by Sir Roderick Mm-chison as occurring in Suther-
landshire, where their relation to the inferior conglomerates is so ably traced, and
also those described by the late 'Mv. Salter from the Longmynd beds in "Wales, that

if similarity of fossil "forms are to govern us in determining the relation of forma-

tions, then those stratified rocks exhibited on the shore at Big-Free-Port and to

Balleochreoch, folding over and suri'oimding the basic conglomerate mass, can only
be placed iu a similar stratigraphical position to those referred to by the above
able authors, thus extending our knowledge of Cambrian rocks occurring fur-
ther south in Scotland than has been hitherto recorded. The author quite agreed

with Prof. Ramsay iu supposing that these rocks were deposited in an inland and

freshwater lake ; and that those cracks are due to the influence of the sun is abun-

dantly evident. If they had been deposited in an estuary of the sea, the soft mud

would not have got time to crack, as each intiowing tide would have kept the

matrix sufficiently moist to prevent its shrinking.

   3rd. The metaraorphic rocks on the western extremity of the island, and skirt-
ing the shores of Lochendale for nine miles to the east, and dipping S.S.W. or

nearly at right angles to the plains of stratification of the preceding deposits, are

of Laurentian age. They differ so widely both in mineral character and strati-

graphical aspect from those of the central valley and eastern side of the island,

that there can be little doubt regarding theu' proper identification. Their litho-

logical aspect and mineral character coincides so well with the fundamental Gneiss
of Sutherlandshire, and desigTiated by Sir Roderick Murchison as of Laurentian

age, that we have not the shghtest hesitation in identifying those of Islay as be-

longing to the same period.

   4th. Iu the basic conglomerates on the eastern side of the island we have got
traces of striated rocks imbedded in the mass, although we are not prepared to

 speak with any degi-ee of certainty regarding the source or direction of the materials

constituting the conglomerate mass. If, however, we glance at the topographical

 aspect of the Highlands and Island, and compare the imbedded boulders of granite

with the granites found in situ throughout the Highlands, we feel the necessity of
tracing them to another source, and hope we do not overstep the bounds of prudent

speculation in suggesting that those erratics are the reasserted materials of some
 great northern continent that has yielded to the ceaseless gnawing tooth of time,
 leaving those scattered fragments as the wreckage of its former greatness, and that

the materials of which the mass is composed have in time, deeper than we have

 hitherto suspected, been transported by the agency of ice. If so, then this is

 another proof that we are not in a position to limit the agency of ice to any single

 period of our earth's history.

  Professor W. C. Williamson referred to Mr. Binney's original description, in

 112 REPORT-- 1871.

 a central medullaiy axis of cellular tissue with several detached longitudinal
 buudles of vascular tissue at its circumference. Outside this is a lax lig;neous zone,
 to the interior of which the bundles just referred to are adherent. The vessels of
 the ligneous zone are reticulated, and arranged in radiating series, the radiating
 lamina? being separated at very frequent intervals by thick cellular medullary rays,
 consisting of numerous vertical series of cells. External to the woody zone is a
 very thick and characteristic bark, the inner portion of which is loosely cellular,
 but the exterior has a different structure. It consists of a combination of cellular
 parenchyma and dense elongated prosenchyma, the latter appearing in the trans-
 verse section as a series of dark bands, radiating at varying angles from the inner
 to the epidermal layer of the outer bark. Vertically these prosenchymatous bands

 are prolonged as layers, which extend upwards and downwards in a wavy manner,

 alternately approaching and receding from one another, so that a tangential section
 exhibits a series of lenticular areolae whose longer axes correspond with that of the
stem. The outermost bark-layer appears to be a cellular epidermal tissue, which
 has probably supported external appendages, either scales or leaves. In the inner

layer of the bark we see a series of variously developed vascular bundles which

spring as branches from the ligneous zone, but which ascend for a considerable
distance without escaping through the bark, whilst a second series of branches are
given off in like manner, but which at ouce perforate the bark in their passage out-
wards. This plant is from the lower coal-measures of Lancashire and Yorkshire.

  A second form of Dictyoxi/lon, to which the author gives the name of D. radicmis,

has evidently been a branching root which has been traced continuously into its
ultimate rootlets. This plant has no pith, and its compact woody zone, consisting
of reticulated vessels, is furnished with medullary rays of a much simpler con-
struction than those of D. Oldhamium. They are not unfrequently represented in
the tangential section by a single cell ; and there are rfirely more than five or six
such cells in each vertical pile. The bark consists of parench-^Tnatous cells aiTanged
in rows perpendicular to the surface. This is also a Lancashire form.

  A third species of Dictyoxijlon discovered in beds of the lower Carboniferous

series of Bm-ntisland is named D. Gn'evii after its discoverer, Mr. Grieve. Its
central axis is much deranged, resembling the Heterangium paradoxum of Corda
but several specimens have occurred showing that there was a central vascular axis
surrounded by a lax radiating ligneous zone, which in turn was invested by a re-
markable cellular bark, which exhibited, both in radiating and tangential sections, a

characteristic series of parallel horizontal lines, resulting from a peculiar condition

of the cellular parenchyma at the points where they exist. As in D. Oldha7nium,
vascular bundles ascend through the inner bark. The plants described were con-
nected by the author with some large casts of bark fi'om the Coal-measures, some ot
which have been described as Sagenarire and Lyginodendra. These specimens have
upon their surface elongated lenticular scars arranged as in Lepidodendron ; but
usually much more elongated in a vertical direction than in that genus, and always
lacking the central spots marking the issue of vascular bundles. These areolre are
not leaf-scars, bvit casts of depressions in the outer surface of the bark from which
the epidennis was removed, and which con'espond with the spaces enclosed by the
sinuosities of the proseuchj-matous layers. The functional uses of these areolaj are
undetermined, and there is as yet much uncertainty as to the true affinities of the

genus.

  A recently discovered and very perfect specimen of the so-called CtircttUoides

Prestvicii of Buckland (figured in his ' Bridpewater Treatise,' pi. 46", fig-. 2), from
Dudley, proves this insect to have been one of the " False Scorpions," neai-ly related

to the living genus Phn/nus, and not a Coleopterous insect as supposed by Samouelle.
   The specimen is so preserved as to expose its dorsal and ventral aspect each

distinctly preserved upon the two halves of the nodule ; the former richly orna-
mented with rows and rosettes of tubercles, and the latter showing the smooth
segmented under-surface of the body bearing the tracheal openings. The hinder

border bears four short and stout spines. Fom* pairs of legs are seen, whose wedge-
shaped basal joints meet beneath the cephalothorax, which is veiy tumid, and has a
rather prominent rostrum, probably giving rise to Mr. Samouelle's mistake of calling-

it a Curculio. Mr. Woodward proposed to name this new genus of "false scorpions "
12o2)hrynus, retaining the name Curcnlioides for C. Aiisticii, another example which
may truly belong to the Hhynchophora. There are now 44 insects known and de-

scribed from the Coal-measures, namely 8 Arachnida, 5 Myriapoda, 3 Coleoptera,

13 Orthoptera, 14 Neui'optera, and a doubtful Lepidopterous insect.

                        By Henry Woodwabd, F.Q.S., F.Z.S.

Whilst admitting that during particular eras circumstances may have favoured

the development of special gi'oups of organisms, which in consequence flourished

in greater abundance than the rest, the author deprecated the idea of the preva-

lence of peculiar conditions at any time since the advent of organic life on the

globe.

Although in the earlier Palaeozoic rocks we have little or no evidences of land,

yet the fact of stratified deposits being formed at the bottom of the sea is positive

evidence of the waste of neighbouring land-surfaces, which must have been always

in existence. And further, if conditions in the sea were favourable to the de-

velopment of abundance of animal life, those on the land were in all probability

equally so.

Mr. Woodward referred to the abundance of evidence of land-surfaces every-

where, both in Quaternary and in Tertiary times, the former differing but little,

save in the geographical distribution of its fauna, from that of the present day, the

latter differing more and more from the existing fauna and flora, and also in its
relation to existing lands. When, however, the base of the Tertiaries is reached,

the land-surfaces are divided by greater marine accumulations ; nevertheless we

find, both in Europe and America, freshwater deposits with remains of land-plants

and animals often in rich abundance. Even the truly marine deposits (such as the

Challf) testify to the presence of land by the fossil remains of Pterodactyles, Che-

loniffi, and other shore-dwelling reptiles.

   Mr. Woodward instanced the Wealden beds, the Purbeck limestone, and Oolitic

plant-shales as affording abundant proofs of Mesozoic lands, whilst truly marine

accumulations (such as the Solenhofen limestone) contain swarms of insects, flying

lizards, and a true bird, with branches of Coniferse and other trees to tell of a land-

fauna adjacent to its waters.

   The author noticed the earliest mammals found in the Triassic bone-beds of

Stuttgart and Somerset, and the ripple-marked slabs covered with bird-like ti-acks

and Labyrinthodont foot-marks, telling of the denizens of the old Triassic sea-

shores and lakes.

  He next described the coal-period, with its stores of land-plants and Reptilia,
both aquatic and terrestrial, its insects and moUusca. He controverted the argu-
ments of Dr. T. Sterry Hunt as to the exceptional condition of the atmosphere of

the Coal-period, and showed that the presence of animal life disproved the existence

of an atmosphere charged with carbonic acid gas, and that plants would not be

benefitted thereby, as Dr. Hunt supposed.
   With respect to the wide distribution of coal, Mr. Woodward pointed out that

it was not necessary to assume that all coal was formed throughout the world during

one and the same epoch, but, on the contrary, he showed that coal might be alike as

regards its faima and flora, and yet of very widely difierent ages.

  He advocated the formation of coal from the slow but sure accumulation of peat-

gTowth, as that mode of conservation of vegetable matter was proved to be the
most certain to yield pure hydrocarbons such as we find the coal to consist of, tin-
mixed withforeif/n matter. Such pm-e accumulations could not (in the opinion of
the author) be formed in river-vaUeys, deltas of great rivers, or in marine swamps
and marshes, but on wide plains covered with a thick vegetation, and tending, by

its clayey soil, to check drainage and produce peat-growth.

   Mr. Woodward referred to the discoveries of Devonian land-plants and insects
by Dr. Dawson in North America, and to the occurrence of seed-spores of land-
plants in Silurian strata ; he suggested that the veins of Graphite may be accepted

as evidence of old coal-seams, altered by heat and pressure; and that the oil-

springs in the Silurian rocks may be due to the destructive distillation of old coal-
beds in Nature's own retort.

Address hy Dr. Allen Thoiison, F.R.SS. L. 4" E., Professor of Anatomy hi the

                          University of Glasgoiu, President of the Section,

In now opening the Meetings of the Biological Section, it is my first duty to ex-

press my deep sense of the honoiu* which has been conferred upon me in appointing

myme to preside over its deliberations. I trust that  gi-ateful acceptance of the

oflice will not appear to be an assumption on my part of more than a partial con-

jiexion with the very wide field of science iuchided under the term Biology. I

should gladly have embraced the opportunity now afforded me of conforming to a

custom which has of late become almost the rule with the Presidents of Sections,

viz. that of bringing imder your review a notice of the more valuable discoveries

with which our science has been enriched in recent times, were it not that tlie

subjects which I might have been disposed to select would require an amount of

detail in each which would necessarily limit gi-eatly their number, and that any

attempt to overtake the whole range of this widespread department of science,

even in the most general remarks, woidd be equally presumptuous and futile on the

part of one whose attention has been restricted mainly to one of its divisions. I

am further emban-assed iu the choice of topics for general remark by the circum-

stance that many of those upon which I might have ventured to address you have

mybeen most ably treated of by  predecessors, as, for example, in the Sectional

Addresses of Dr. Acland, Dr. Sharpey, Mr. Berkeley, Dr. Himiphiy, and Dr. Rol-

leston, as well as in the General Presidential Addresses of Dr. Hooker and Pro-

fessor Huxley. I must content myself, therefore, with endeavouring to convey to

you some of the ideas which arise in my mind in looking back from the present

--iipon the state of Biological Science at the time when, forty years since, the Meetings

of the British Association commenced a period which I am tempted to particu-
larize from its happening to coincide very nearly with that at which I began my

career as a public teacher in one of the departments of Biology in this city. In the few

remarks which I shall make, it will be my object to show the prodigious advance

which has taken place not only in the knowledge of our subject as a whole, but

also inthe ascertained relation of its parts to each other, and in the place which

Biological knowledge has gained in the estimation of the educated part of the com-

munity, and the consequent increase in the freedom with which the search after

truth is now asserted in this as in other departments of science.
   And first, in connexion with the distribution of the various subjects which are

included under this Section, I may remark that the general title under which the

Dwhole Section has met since 186G, viz. Biology, seems to be advantageous both

from its convenience, and as tending to promote the gi'eater consolidation of our

science, and a juster appreciation of the relation of its several parts. It may be

that, looking merely to the derivation of the term, it is sti'ictly more nearly synony-
                                                                                                     :

                       TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                 ,115

inous with physiology in the sense in which that word has been for a long time

employed, and therefore designating the science of life, rather than the description
of the living beings in which it is manifested. But until a better or more compre-

hensive term be found, we may accept that of biology under the general definition

of " the science of life and of living beings," or as compi-ehending the history of the

--whole range of organic natui-e vegetable as well as animal. The propriety of the

adoption of such a general term is further shown by a glance at the changes which

the titles and distribution of tlie subordinate departments of this Section have imder-

gone during the period of the existence of the Association.

   During the first four years of this period the Section met under the combined

--designation of Zoology and Botany, Physiology and Anatomy words sufficiently

clearly indicating the scope of its subjects of investigation. In the next ten years

a connexion with Medicine was recognized by the establishment of a subsection

or department of Medical Science, in which, however, scientific anatomy and phy-

siology formed the most prominent topics, though not to the exclusion of more

strictly medical and surgical or professional subjects. During the next decade, or

from the year 1845 to 1854, we find along with Zoology and Botany a subsection

of Phj'siology, and in several years of the same time along with the latter a separate

department of Ethnology. In the eleven years which extended from 1855 to 18G5,
the branch of Ethnology was associated with Geograpliy in Section E. More re-

cently, or since the an-angement which was commenced in 1866, the Section

Biology has included, with some slight variation, the whole of its subjects in three
departments. Under one of these are brought all investigations in Anatomy and

Physiology of a general kind, thus embracing the whole range of these sciences

Awhen without special application.    second of these departments has been occu-

pied with the extensive subjects of Botany and Zoology ; while the third has been

devoted to tlie subject of Anthropology, in which all researches having a special

reference to the structure and functions or life-history of man have been received
and discussed. Such I understand to be the arrangement under which we shall

meet on this occasion. At the conclusion of my remarks, therefore, the depart-
ment of Anatomy and Physiology will remain with me in this room ; while that

of Zoology and Botany, on the one hand, and of Anthropology on the other, will

adjourn to the apartments which have been provided for them respectively.

   With regard to the position of Anthropology, as including Ethnology, and com-
prehending the whole natural history of man, there may be still some differences

of opinion, according to the point of view from which its phenomena are regarded

as by some they may be viewed chief!}' in relation to the bodily structiu'e and func-

tions  of individuals  or numbers of  men                         or  as by others  they may be considered
                                                               ;

more directly with reference to their national character and history, and the affini-

ties of languages and customs ; or by a third set of inquirers, as bearing more im-

mediately upon the origin of man and his relation to animals. As the first and

third of these sets of topics entirely belong to Biology, and as those parts of the

second set which do not properly fall under that branch may with propriety find a

place under Geogi-aphy or Statistics, I feel inclined to adhere to the distinct recog-

nition of a department of Anthropology, in its present                form                           and I think that the
                                                                                                  ;

suitableness of this arrangement is apparent, from the nature and number of the

appropriate reports and communications which have been received under the last

di.stribution of the subjects.

The beneficial influence of the British Association in promoting biological re-

search is shown by the fact that the number of the communications to the Sections,

received annually has been nearly doubled in the course of the last twenty years.

And this influence has doubtless been materially assisted by the contributions in

money made by the Association in aid of various biological investigations; for it

appears that, out of the whole sum of nearly £34,600 contributed by the Associa-

tion to the promotion of scientific research, about £2800 has been devoted to biolo-

gical purposes, to which it would be fair to add a part at least of the grants for

Palosontological researches, many of which must be acknowledged to stand in close

relation to Biology.

The enormous extent of knowledge and research in the various departments of

Biology has become a serious impediment to its more complete study, and leads to
                                                                                                   8*

the danger of confined views on the part of those whose attention, from necessity

or taste,' is too exclusively directed to the details of one department, or even, as
often happens, to a subdivision of it. It would seem, indeed, aa if our predecessors

in the last generation possessed this superior advantage in the then existing nar-

rower boundaries of knowledge, that it was possible for them to overtake the con-
templation of a wider field, and to follow out researches in a gi-eater number of the

sciences. To such combination of varied knowledge, united with their ti-anscen-

dent powers of sound generalization and accurate observation, must be ascribed

the widespread and enduring influence of the works of such men as Haller,

Linnseus, Cuvier, Von Baer, and Johannes Miiller. There are doubtless brilliant

instances in our own time of men endowed with similar powers ; but the diffi-

culty of bringing these powers into effectual operation in a wide ran^e is
mnow so gi'eat, that, while the amoimt of research
                                                    special biological subjects

is enormous, it must be reserved for comparatively few to be the authors of great
systems, or of enduring broad and general views which embrace the whole range

of biological science. It is incumbent, therefore, on all those who are desirous of

promoting the advance of biological knowledge to combat the confined views which

are apt to be engendered by the too gi-eat restriction of study to one department.

However much subdivision of labour may now be necessary in the original investi-

gation and elaboration of new facts in our science (and the necessity for such sub-

division will necessarily increase as knowledge extends), there must be secured at

first, by a wider study of the general principles and some of the details of collateral

branches of knowledge, that power of justly comparing and correlating facts

which will mature the judgment and exclude partial views. To refer only to one

bright example, I might say that it can scarcely be doubted that it is the unequalled

variety and extent of knowledge, combined with the faculty of bringing the most

varied facts together in new combination, which has enabled Dr. Darwin (what-
ever may be thought otherwise of his system) to give the greatest impulse which

has been felt in our own times to the progi-ess of biological views and thought

and it is most satisfactory to observe the effect which this influence is already

producing on the scientific mind of this country, in opposing the tendency per-

ceptible in recent times to the too restricted study of special departments of natural

history. I need scarcely remind you that for the proper investigation and judg-
ment of problems in physiology, a full knowledge of anatomy in general, and much

of comparative anatomy, of histology and embiyology, of organic chemistiy and of

physics, is indispensable as a preliminaiy to all successful physiological observation

and experiment. The anatomist, again, who would profess to describe rationally

and correctly the structure of the human body, must have acquired a knowledge of

the principles of morphology derived from the study of comparative anatomj' and

development, and he must have mastered the intricacies of histological research.

The comparative anatomist must be an accomplished embryologist in the whole

range of the animal kingdom, or in any single division of it which he professes to

cultivate. The zoologist and the botanist must equally found their descriptions and

63'stematic distinctions on morphological, histological, and embryological data. Aaid

thus the whole of these departments of biological science are so interwoven and

imited that the scientific investigation of no one can now be regarded as altogether

separate from that of the others. It has been the work of the last forty years to

bring that intimate connexion of the biological sciences more and more fully into

prominent view, and to infuse its spirit into all scientific investigation. But while

in all the departments of biology prodigious advances have been made, there are

two more especially which merit particular mention as having almost taken their

origin within the period I now refer to, as having made the most rapid progress in

themselves, and as having influenced most powerfully and widely the progi-ess of

--discovery, and the views of biologists in other departments I mean Histology and

Embryology.

I need scarcely remind those present that it was only within a few years before the

foundation of the British Association that the suggestions of Lister in regard to

the construction of achromatic lenses brought the compound microscope into such

a state of improvement as caused it to be restored, as I might say, to the place
which the more imperfect instrument had lost in the previous century. The re-
                           TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                            117

suit of this restoration became apparent in the foundation of a new era in the

knowledge of the minute characters of textural structm'e, under the joint guidance

of Robert Brown and Ehrenberg, with contributions from many other observers,

so as at last to have almost entitled this branch of inquiry to its designation,

by ]Mr. Huxley, of the exhaustive investigation of structm-al elements. All who
hear me are aware of the influence which, from 1839 onwards, the researches of

Schwann and Schleiden exerted on the progress of Histology and the views of

anatomists and physiologists as to the structure and development of the textures

both of plants and animals, and the prodigious increase which followed in varied

microscopic observations. It is not for me here even to allude to the steps of that
rapid progress by which a new branch of anatomical science has been created ; nor

can I venture to enter upon any of the interesting questions presented by this de-

partment of microscopic anatomy ; nor attempt to discuss any of those difiicult

problems possessing so much interest at the present moment, such as the nature of

the organized cell or the properties of protoplasm. I would only remark that it is

now very generally admitted that the cell-wall (as Schwann indeed himself pointed
out) is not a constant constituent of the cell, nor a source of new production,

though stiU capable of considerable structm'al change after the time of its first

formation. The nucleus has also lost some of the importance attached to it by

Schwann and his earlier followers, as an essential constituent of the cell, while

the protoplasm of the cell remains in undisputed possession of the field as the more

immediate seat of the phenomena of growtli and organization, and of the contrac-

tile property which forms so remarkable a feature of their substance. I cordially

agree with much of what Mr. Huxley has written on this subject in 1853 and

1869. The term physical basis of life may perhaps be in some respect objection-

able                       but I look upon the  recognition of protoplasm which  he  has  enforced  as  a
                        ;

most important step in the recent progTess of histology, adopting this general

term to indicate that part of the organized substance of plants and animals which is

the constant seat of the growing and moving powers, but not implying identity of
nature and properties in all the variety of circumstances in which it may occur. To
Haeckel the fuller history of protoplasm in its lowest forms is due. To Dr. Beale
we owe the minutest and most recent investigation of these properties by the use of

maguifj'ing-powers beyond any that had previously been known, and the success-

ful employment of reagents which appear to mark out its distinction * fi-om the

other elements of the textures. I may remark, however, in passing, that I am

inclined to regard contractile protoplasm, whether vegetable or animal, as in no

instance entirely amoi-phous or homogeneous, but rather as always presenting some

minute molecular structure which distinguishes it from parts of glassy clearness.
Admitting that the form it assumes is not necessarily that of a regular cell, and

may be various and irregular in a few exceptional instances, I am not on that ac-

count disposed to give up definite structure as one of the universal characteristics

of organization in living bodies. I would also suggest that the terms formative
and non-formative, or some other such, would be preferable to those of " living and

dead," employed by Dr. Beale to distinguish the protoplasm from the ceU-wall or

its derivatives, as these latter terms are liable to introduce confusion.

   To the discoveries in embryology and development I might ha^e been tempted

to refer more at large, as being those which nave had, of all modern research,

the greatest effect in extending and modifying biological views, but I am
warned from entering upon a subject in which I might trespass too much

on j'our patience. The merits of Wolft" as the great leader in the accurate ob-
servation of the phenomena of development were clearly pointed out by Mr.

Huxley in his presidential address of last year. Under the influence of Dollinger's

teaching, Pander, and afterwards Purkinje, Von Baer, and Rathke, established

the foundations of the modern history of embryolog^l^ It was only in the year
1827 that the ovum of mammals was discovered by Von Baer; the segmentation
of the yelk, first observed by Prevost and Dumas in the frog's ovum in 1824, was

ascertained to be general in succeeding years ; so that the whole of the interesting
and important additions which have followed, and have made the history of em-

bryological development a complete science, have been included within the eventful

period of the life of this Association. I need not say how distinguished the Germans

nave been by their contributions to the history of animal development. The names
of Valentin, R. Wagner, BischofF, Reichert, Kolliker, and Remak are sufficient

to indicate the most important of the earlier steps in recent progress, without at-

tempting to enumerate a host of others who have assisted in the great work thus

founded.

I am aware that the mere name of development suggests to some ideas of a

disturbino- kind as being associated with the theory of evolution recently pro-

mulgated. To one accustomed diuing the whole of his career to trace the steps by

which every living being, including man himself, passes from the condition of an

almost imperceptible germ, through a long series of changes of form and structure

into their perfect state, the name of development is suggestive rather of that which

seems to be tlie common history of all li^-ing beings ; and it is not wonderful therefore

that such a one should regard with approval the more extended view which sup-

Howposes a process of development to belong to the whole of nature.  far that

principle maj- be carried, to what point the origin of man or an}' animal can by facts

or reasoning be traced in the long unchronicled history of the world, and whether

living beings may arise independently of parents or germs of previously existing

organisms, or may spriug from the direct combination of the elements of dead mat-

ter, are questions still to be solved, and upon which we may expect this Section to

oguide the hesitating opinion of the time. I cannot better express the state of

opinion in which I find myself in regard to the last of these problems, than by

quoting the words of Professor Huxley from his address of last year, p. Ixxxiii :
   " But though I cannot express this conviction of mine too stronglj' [viz. that

the evidence of the most careful experiments is opposed to the occiuTence of spon-

taneous generation], I must carefully guard myself against the supposition that I

intend to suggest that no such thing as abiogenesis ever has taken place in the

past, or ever will take place in the future. With organic chemistry, molecular

physics, and physiology yet in their infancy, and every day making prodigious

strides, I think it would be the height of presumption for any man to say that the
conditions imder which matter assumes the properties we call 'vital, may not,
some day, be artificially brought togetlier." And again, " If it were given me to

look beyond the abyss of geologically recorded time to the still more remote

period when the earth was passing through physical and chemical conditions,
which it can no more see again than a man can recall his infancy, I should expect

to be a witness of the evolution of living protoplasm from not living matter. I

will quote further a few -n-ise words from the discourse to which many of you
must have listened last evening with admiration. Sir William Thomson said :--

" The essence of scieuce, as is well illustrated by astronomy and cosmical physics,

consists in inferring antecedent conditions, and anticipating future evolutions, from

phenomena which have actually come imder obsers'ation. In biology, the diffi-

culties of successfully acting up to this ideal are prodigious. Our code of biologi-

cal law is an expression of our ignorance as well as of our knowledge." And

again, " Search for spontaneous generation out of inorganic materials ; let any one

not satisfied with the pm-ely negative testimony of which we have now so much

against it, throw himself into the inquiry. Such investigations as those of Pas-

tern-, Pouchet, and Bastian are among the most interesting and momentous in the

whole range of natural history, and their residts, whether positive or negative,

must richly reward the most careful and laborious experimenting."

The consideration of the finest discoverable structures of the organized parts

of living bodies is intimately bound np with that of their chemical composition

and properties. The progress which has been made in organic chemistry be-

longs not only to the knowledge of the composition of the constituents of or-

ganized bodies, but also to the manner in which that composition is che-

mically viewed. Its peculiar featm-e, especially as related t-o biological inves-

tigation, consists in the results of the introduction of the synthetic method

of research, which has enabled the chemist to imitate or to foi-m artificially

a greater and gi'oater nianber of the organic compounds. In 1828 the first of

tliese substances was formed by Wohler, by a synthetic process, as cyanate of

ammonia. But still, at that time, though a few no doubt entertained juster views,

the opinion generally prevailed among chemists and physiologists that there was
some gi-eat and fundamental difference in the chemical phenomena and laws of
organic and inorganic nature. Now, however, this supposed barrier has been in a

great measure broken do-svai and removed, and chemists, with almost one accord,
regard the laws of combination of the elements as essentially the same in both

classes of bodies, whatever difl'erences may exist in actual composition, or in the

reactions of organic bodies in the more complex and often obscure conditions of
vitality, as compared with the simpler and, on the whole, better known pheno-
mena of a chemical nature observed in the mineral kingdom. Thus, by the syn-
thetic method, there have been formed among the simpler organic compounds a
great number of alcohols, hydrocarbons, and fatty acids. But the most remarkable
example of the synthetic formation of an organic compound is that of the alkaloid

conia, as recently obtained by Hugo Schitf by certain reactions from butyric
aldehyde, itself an artificial product. The substance so formed, and its com-

--pounds, possess all the properties of the natm-al conia chemical, physical, and
--physiological being equally poisonous with it. The colouring-matter of madder,

or alizarine, is another organic compound which has been formed by artificial

processes. It is true that the organized or containing solid, either of -N-egetable or
animal bodies, has not as yet jdelded to the ingenuitj^ of chemical artitice ; nor,

indeed, is the actual composition of one of the most, important of these, albumen
and Its allies, fully known. But as chemists have only recently begun to discover

the track by which they may be led to the synthesis of organic compounds, it is

warrantable to hope that ere long cellulose and lignine maj' be formed ; and, great

as the difficulties with regard to the albumenoid compoimds may at present

appear, the synthetic formation of these is by no means to be despaired of, but, on

the contrary, may with confidence be expected to crown their eflbrts. From all

recent research, therefore, it appears to result that the general natm'c of the

properties belonging to the products of animal and vegetable life can no longer bo
regarded as diflerent from those of minerals, in so far at least as they are the
subject of chemical and physical investigation. The union of elements and their
separation, whether occmTing in an animal, a vegetable, or a mineral body, must
bo looked upon as dependent on innate powers or properties belonging to the
elements themselves; and the phenomena of change of composition of organic

bodies occurring in the living state are not the less chemical because they are
different from those observed in inorganic nature. All chemical actions are liable

to vary according to the conditions in which they occur ; and many'"instances
might be adduced of most remarkable variations of this kind, observed in the che-
mistry of dead bodies from very slight changes of electrical, calorific, mechanical,
and other conditions. But because the conditions of action or change are infi-
nitely more complex and far less known in living bodies, it is not necessary to
look upon the phenomena as essentially of a diflerent kind, to have recourse to
the hypothesis of vital affinities, and still less to shelter ourselves under the slim
curtain of ignorance implied in the explanation of the most varied chemical
changes by the influence of a vital principle.

   On the subjects of zoological and botanical classification and anthropology, it
would be out of place for nie now to make any observations at length. I will
only remark, in regard to the first, that the period now under review has wit-

nessed a very great modification in the aspect in which the affinities of the bodies
belonging to these two great kingdoms of nature are viewed by naturalists, and
the principles on which groups of bodies in each are associated together in syste-
matic classification ; for, in the first place, the older view has been abandoned that
the complication of structm-e rises in a continually increasing and continuous gra-
dation from one kingdom to the other, or extends in one line, as it were, from group
to group in either of the kingdoms separately. Evolution into a gradually in-
creasing complexity of structure and nuictiou no doubt exists in both, so that
tj-pes or general plans of formation must be acknowledged to exist, presenting

typical resemblances of the deepest interest ; but in the progress of morphological
research it has become more and more apparent that the different groups form
radiations, which touch one another at certain points of greatest resemblance, rather

than one continuous line, or a number of lines which partially pass each other. The

simpler bodies of tlie two kingdoms of nature exhibit a gradually increasing re-
semblance to each other, until at last the dift'erences between them wholly disap-

pear, and we reach a point of contact at which the properties become almost in-

distinguishable, as in the remarkable Protista of Haeckel and others. I fiUly agree,

however, with the view stated by Professor WyviUe Thomson in his recent intro-

ductory lecture, that it is not necessary on this accoimt to recognize, with Haeckel,
a third or intermediate kingdom of nature. Each kingdom presents, as it were, a
radiating expansion into groups for itself, so that the relations of the two king-
doms mi"-ht be represented by the divergence of lines spreading in two different

directions from a common point. Recent observations on the chorda dorsalis, or

supposed notochord, of some Ascidians, tend to re\-ive the discussion, at one time
prevalent, but long in abeyance, as to the possibility of tracing an homology be-
tween the vertebrate and invertebrate animals ; and, should this coiTespondence be

confirmed and extended, it may be expected to modify greatly our present views

of zoological affinities and classification. It will also be an additional proof of the
unportance of minute and embryological research in systematic determinations.
The recognition of homological resemblance of animals, to which in this country

the researches of Owen and Huxley have contributed so largely, form one of the

most interesting subjects of contemplation in the study of comp.arative anatomy
and zoology in our time ; but I must refrain from touching on so seductive and

difficult a subject.

    There is another topic to which I can refer with pleasure as connected with the
cultivation of biological knowledge in this countiy, and that is the introduction
of instruction in natural science into the system of education of our schools. As

^o the feasibility of this in the primary schools, I believe most of those who
are intimately acquainted with their management have expressed a decidedly

--fiivourable opinion it being found that a portion of the time now allotted to the

three great requisites of a primary education might with advantage be set apart,
for the purpose of insti-ucting the pupils in subjects of common interest, calculated

 to awaken in their minds a desire for knowledge of the various objects presented

 by the iield of natm-e around them. As to the benefit which may result from this
measure to the persons so instructed, it is scarcely necessary for me to say anything

 in this place. It is so obvious that any varied knowledge, however easily acquired
 or elementary, which tends to enlarge the range of observation and thought, must

 have some effect in removing its recipients from grosser influences, and may even
 supply information which may prove useful in social economy and in the occupa-
 tions of labour. Nor need I point out how much more extended the advantages
 of such instruction may prove if introduced into the system of our secondary

 schools, and more freely combined than heretofore with the too exclusively

 literaiy and philosophical study which has so long prevailed in the approved
 J3ritish education. Without disparagement to those modes of study as in them-
 selves necessary and useful, and excellent means of disciplining the mind to learn-
 ing, I cannot but hold it as certain that the mind which is entirely without scien-

 tific cultivation is but half prepared for the common pui-poses of modern life, and

 is entirely unqualified for forming a judgment on some of the most difficult and

 yet most common and important questions of the day, affecting the interests of the

 whole community. I refer with pleasure to the published Essay of Dr. Lankester

 on this subject, and to the arguments addressed two days ago by Dr. Bennett to

 the medical graduates of the University, in favour of the establishment of physi-

 ology as a subject of general education in this country with reference to sanitary

 conditions. It is gi-atifyiug, therefore, to perceive that the suggestions made some

 years ago in regard to this subject by the British .Vssociation, through its com-

 mittee, have already borne good fruit, and that the attention of those who preside

 over education in this country, as well as of the public tliemselves, is more earnestly

  directed to the object of securing for the lowest as well as the highest classes of

 tlie commimity that wholesome combination of knowledge derived from education,
 which will duly cultivate all the faculties of the mind, and thus fit a greater and
 greater number for applying themselves with increased ability and knowledge to
 the purposes of their living and its improved condition. If the law of the survival
 of the fittest be applicable to the mental as well as to the physical improvement

of our race (and who can doubt that in some measure it must be so ?), we are bound

by motives of interest and duty to secm-e for all classes of the people that kind of

education which will lead to the development of the highest and most varied

mental power. And no one who has been observant of the recent progress of the

useful arts and its influence upon the moral, social, and political condition of

our population, can doubt that such education must include instruction in the

phenomena of external nature, including, more especially, the laws and condi-

tions of life and health ; and that it ought to be, at the same time, such as will

adapt the mind to the ready acquisition and j ust comprehension of varied knowledge.
It is obvious, too, that while this more immediatel)^ useful or beneficial effect on
the common mind may be produced by the dift'usion of natural Imowledge among the

people, biological science will share in the gain accruing to all branches of natural

science, by the greater favour which will be accorded to its cultivators, and the

increased freedom from'prejudice with which their statements are received and

considered by learned as well as by imscientific persons.

   I cannot conclude these observations without adverting to one aspect in which
it may be thought that the appreciation'of biological science has taken a retrogi-ade

rather than an advanced position. In this, I do not mean to refer to the special

cidtivators of biology in its scientific acceptation, but to the fact that there ap-

pears to have taken place of late a considerable increase in the number of persons
who believe, or who imagine that they believe, in the class of phenomena which
are now "called spiritual, but which have been known, since the exhibitions of

Mesmer, and, indeed, long before his time, vmder the most varied forms, as liable

to occur in persons of an imaginative turn of mind and peculiar nervous suscep-

tibility. It is to be regretted that a number of persons devote a large share of

their time to the practice (for it does not deserve the name of study or investiga-

tion) of the alleged phenomena, and that a few men of aclmowledged reputation

in some departments of science have lent their names, and surrendered their

judgment, to the countenance and attempted authentication of the delusive dreams

of the practitioners of spiritualism, and similar chimerical hj'potheses. The natu-

ral tendency to a belief in the marvellous is sufficient to explain the ready accept-

ance of such views by the ignorant ; and it is not improbable that a higher species of

similar credulity may frequently^act with^ persons of gi-eater cultivation, should

their scientific information and training have been of a partial kind. It must be

admitted, further, that extremelj' curious and rare and, to those who are not ac-

quainted with the nervous functions, apparently marvellous phenomena, present

--themselves in peculiar states of the nervous system some of which states may be

induced through the mind and may be made more and more liable to recur, and

to be greatly exaggerated by frequent repetition. But making the fullest allowance

for all these conditions, it is still surprising that persons, otherwise appearing

not to be irrational, should entertain a confirmed belief in the possibility of

phenomena, which, while they are at variance with the best established physical

laws, have never been brought under proof by the evidences of the senses, and ai'e

opposed to the dictates of sound judgment. It is so far satisfactory, in the interests

of true biological science, that no man of note can be named from the long list of
thoroughly well-informed anatomists and physiologists, who has not treated the

belief in the separate existence of powers of animal magnetism and spiritualism as

wild speculations, devoid of all foundation in the carefully tested obsei-vation of

facts. It has been the habit of the votaries of the systems to which I have refeiTed

to assert that scientific men have neglected or declined to investigate the pheno-

mena Avith attention and candour                                                                                                                              but  nothing can be further from the truth than

this statement. Not to mention the admirable reports of the early French acade-

micians, giving the account of the negative result of an examination of the earlier

mesmeric phenomena by men in every way qualified to pronounce judgment on their
nature, I am aware that from time to time men of eminence, and fully competent,

by their knowledge of biological phenomena, and their skill and accm-acy in con-

ducting scientific investigation, have made the most patient and careful examina-

tion of the evidence placed before them by the professed believers and practitioners

of so-called mesmeric, magnetic, phrenomagnetie, electrobiological, and other like

phenomena; and the result has Been uniformly the same in all cases when they

were permitted to secure conditions by which the reality of the phenomena, or the
justice of their interpretation, could be tested, Aiz. either that, on the one hand,
the phenomena were not essentially different from those well known to physiologists
as modifications of the nervous and muscular functions under peculiar mental
states ; or that, on the other hand, the experiments signally failed to educe the
results professed, or that the experimenters were detected in shameless and deter-
mined impostures. I have myself been fully convinced of this by repeated ex-
aminations and I can scarcely doubt that the same fate awaits the fair scientific

examination of the so-called spiritualistic phenomena*. But were any guarantee
required for the care, soundness, and efficiency of the judgment of men of science on
such phenomena and views, I have only to mention, in the first place, the revered

name of Faraday, and in the next that of my life-long fiiend Dr. Sharpey, whose
ability and candour none wiU dispute, and who, I am happy to think, is here among

us, ready, from his past experience of such exhibitions, to bear his testimony against

all cases. of levitativn, or the like, which may be the last wonder of the day among

the mesmeric or spiritual pseudo-physiologists. The phenomena to which I have
at present referred are in gi-eat part dependent upon natural principles of the
human mird, placed, as it would appear, in dangerous alliance with certain ten-
dencies of the nervous system. They ought not to be worked upon without the
greatest caution, and they can only be fully understood by the accomplished physi-

ologist who is also conversant with healthy and morbid psychology. The experi-
ence of the last hundred years tends to show that, while there are always to be

found persons peculiarly liable to exhibit the phenomena in question, there will
also exist a certain number of minds prone to adopt a belief in the marvellous and
striking in preference to that which is easily understood and patent to the senses

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

but it may be confidently expected that the diff"Lision of a fuller and more accurate
knowledge of physiology among the non-scientific classes of the community may
lead to a juster appreciation of the phenomena in question, and a reduction of the
number among them who are believers in scientific impossibilities.

               On some new Experiments relating to the Orir/in of Life.
                           By Dr. Chaklton Bastian, F.li.8,

     On the Action of Heat on Germ-life. By P. Ceace-Calveet, F.lt.8.

   The question of building ovens for disinfecting purposes, gives the subject of
this paper more than a merely scientific interest, as it thus becomes one of great
practical importance. As it is foimd that certain forms of life can exist when
exposed to a temperature equal to that at which the charring of organic matter
commences, it is unsafe to assume that the particular forms of life which propa-
gate certain forms of disease wiU be destroyed below this temperature. As from
the nature of the case stoving can only be partially applicable, and as it is at pre-
sent not proved eftective where it is applicable, it is imadvisable to spend public
money imtil a gi-eater degree of certainty is arrived at.

    The experiments described were not, however, undertaken with an intention of
influencing the settlement of this question, but were part of a series on the question
of putrefaction and the development of life.

    It has hitherto been assumed by the advocates of the theory of spontaneous
generation, that a temperature of 212° Fahr., or the boiling-point of the fluid
operated on, was sufficient to destroy all protoplasmic life, and that any life sub-
sequently observed in such fluids must nave been developed from non-li-ving

matter.

    * Tn consequence of several remonstrances made to me since the address was delivered,

 ropresenting that the phenomena of spiritualism had not yet been subjected to a full
 scientific investigation, I have been induced to alter the two preceding sentences from

their original into their present form. But I am still of opinion that these phenomena

 belong essentially to the same class as those of Mesmerism and Electrobiology.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  123

   To determine tWs point experiments were made with solution of sugar, hay in-
fusion, solution of gelatine, and water that had been in contact with putrid meat.

   To carry out these experiments, the author prepared a series of small tubes made

of very thick well-annealed glass, each tube about 4 centimetres in length and having
a bore of 5 millimetres. The fluid to be operated upon was introduced into them,
and left exposed to the atmosphere for a sufficient length of time for germ-life to
be largely developed. Each tube was then hermetically sealed and wrapped in
wire gauze. They were then placed in an oil-bath and gradually heated to the
required temperature, at which they were maintained for half an hour.

   The sugar solution was prepared by dissolving one part of sugar in ten parts of
common water, and exposed to the atmosphere all night, so that life might im-
pregnate it, then placed in tubes and allowed to stand five days. Some of the
tubes were kept without being heated, others heated to 200, 300, 400, and 500° Fahr.

respectively. After being kept twenty-four days, the contents of the tubes were
microscopically examined.

   In the solution not heated, much life was seen ; at 212° a great portion of the
life had disappeared, at 300° the sugar was sUghtly charred but the life not en-
tirely destroyed, while at 400° and 500° the sugar was almost entirely chan-ed, and
no trace of life observed. (It is a small black vibrio which resists the high tempera-

tm-e, and remains unaffected by all chemical solutions.)

   The hay infusion was made by macerating hay in common water for one hour,
filtering the liquor and leaving it exposed to the atmosphere aU night, when it
was sealed in the smaU tubes. The results were examined twenty-four days after

being heated.

   In this case, as in the sugar solution, life was observed in the solutions heated
to 200° and 300° Fahr., while in those heated to 400" and 600° F. life was de-
stroyed. In tlie solution not heated fungus matter was observed, while none ap-
peiared in any of tlie heated solutions.

  A solution of gelatine of such strength that it remained liquid in cooling, was

exposed to the atmosphere for twenty-four hours, and introduced into the small
tubes which were sealed and heated. The fluids were examined twenty-four days

after being heated.

   The animalcules in this case were principally of a different class to those observed
in the two preceding cases, and this class were injured at 100° Fahr. At 212° a
considerable diminution in the amount had taken place, whilst at 300° all life was

destroyed.

   Water was placed in an open vessel, and a piece of meat suspended in it imtU. it
became putrid. This fluid was placed in the usual tubes heated, and the contents
examined after twenty -four days. In this case life was still observed at 300° Fahr.,
while at 400° it had disappeared.

   As previous experimenters have not exposed their solutions to so high a tempera-
ture as 300^ Fahr., the life which they found was due to the development of germs

remaining in the fluid.
   Parts of the putrid meat solutions that had been heated were mixed with albu-

men, to ascertain whether they still possessed the power of propagating life, the
result being that up to 300° Fahr. life and its germs had not been destroyed, whilst
at 400° they had.

   Putrid meat liquor was exposed for twenty hours to a temperature ranging from
the freezing-point to 17° below that point. Immediately after melting the ice the
animalcules appeared languid, and their power of locomotion was gi-eatly decreased,
but in two hom-s they appeared as energetic as before.

                    On Spontaneous Generation, or Protoplasmic Life.
                             By F. Ceace-Calteet, F.B.S.

   The publication of Dr. Tyndall's paper on the abundance of germ-life in the at-
mosphere, and the difficulty of destroying this life, as well as other papers pub-
lished by eminent men of science, suggested the inquiry if the germs existing or
produced in a liquid in a state of fermentation or of putrefaction could be conveyed
124 heport--1871.

to a liquid susceptible of entering into tliesse states ; and during the inquiry some

facts were observed which I wish now to lay before you.

The first is the rapid development of germ-life. If the white of a new-laid egg

be mixed with water (free from life), and exposed to the atmosphere for only fifteen

minutes, in the months of August or September, it will show life in abundance
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

and to the want of a linowledge of this fact may be traced the erroneous conclu-

sions arrived at by several gentlemen who have devoted their attention to the

subject of spontaneous generation.

  An essential point in the carrying out of such an investigation, was the prepara-

tion of pure distilled water. In distilled water prepared hy the ordinary methods,

1 always found life after it had been kept for a few days ; but by employing an ap-
paratus thi-ougli which a gas could be passed to displace the air, and adding to tlie

water to be distilled a solution of potash and permanganate of potash, I obtained a

water which, after three or four distillations, was found to be free from life. The

gas emploved in the first three series was hydrogen. The water was kept in the

apparatus tiU wanted, to prevent any contact with air.

Water so distilled having been kept free from life for seventeen days, was intro-

duced into twelve small tubes, and left exposed to the atmosphere for fifteen hours

when the tubes were closed.  Every eight days the tubes were examined                                                                                                                                                                    on the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

first and second examination no life was observed, but the third discovered two

or three black vibrios in each field.

As this slow and limited development of life might be owing to the small amount

of germs in the atmosphere, during the winter months a second series of experi-
ments was made, placing the water in the tubes near putrid meat for two hours, at
a temperature of 21° to 26° C. Six days after some of the tubes were examined and

life observed, showing that by being placed near a source of protoplasmic life, the
water had in two hours absorbed germs in sufficient quantity, for life to become

visible in one fourth the time required in tlie first experiment ; after six days a
slight increase of life was noticed, but no further development could be aftenvards

seen.

   The limited amount of life developed in pure water suggested a third series of
experiments, in which albumen was added to the water. In this case life appeared

in five days, and a considerable increase in ten. Albumen, therefore, facilitated

the development of life.

The quantity of life produced in the above experiments being comparatively

small, some fresh water was distilled, oxygen being substituted for the hydrogen in
the apparatus ; and a fourth series was commenced, which resulted in showing that

although oxygen appears to favour the development of germs, it does not favour

their reproduction.

  When the weather had become much wanner and a marked increase of life in

the atmosphere had taken place, some of the albumen solution employed in the
above experiments was left exposed in tubes to its influence, when a large quantity
of life was rapidly developed and continued to increase, pi'oving the increase to be
due not merely to reproduction, but to the introduction of fresh germs.

   As no life appeared in that portion of the distilled water remaining in the ap-
paratus before mentioned, which was exaiiiined from time to time, whilst it ap-
peared in all the solutions made with it and impregnated by their exposure to the

atmosphere, it is obvious that gemis are necessary to the production of life.

   Sir Walter stated that he had been led to consider the subject in the prepara-
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  125

tion of an address delivered to the Botanical Society of Edinbuvgli last November,
in the course of which he attempted to show what contributions had been made by
provincial societies to botanical knowledge and literature.

   lie found that the number of these societies had greatly increased of late years,
and that they had done much useful and valuable work. This they publish in
their own Proceedings or Transactions, the circulation of which is confined almost
exclusively to their own members. The results of their labours are thus, in a
great measure, lost both to their neighbours and to naturalists generally. After
entering into some details of the subjects, illustrated by the Devonshire and Corn-
wall Societies, by the Berwickshire, Tyneside, Cotteswold, Woolhope, and other
Field Clubs in their published ' Transactions,' many of the earlier volumes of which
are so scarce as to be unprocurable by later members, he proceeded to show that
this state of things had attracted the attention of others as well as of himself, and

had given rise to a very general desire for greater imity of procedure. He concluded,

therefore, that the time had come for taking action in the matter ; and as the pre-
sent occasion afforded an opportunity for discussing it with advantage, he invited
the Section to take it up, with a view of eliciting practical suggestions (at the same
time offering some himself) of such a nature as might be laid before the General
Committee of the Association, and so enlisting the patronage of that body in its

behalf.

Tlie Orlr/!n and Distribution of Microzymes (Bacteria) in water, and the cir-'
   cumstances which determine their Existence in the Tissues and Liquids of the

  Living Body. By Dr. Buedon Sanderson, F.B.8., and Dr. Febriek.

   The paper read was an abstract of the chief results of an experimental investi-

gation into the intimate nature of contagion pviblished in extemo in the ' Thirteenth
Report of the Medical Officer of the Privy Coimcil.' It was considered necessai-y
to examine the conditions of origin and life of microzymes in special reference to

the phyto-pathological doctrines of Professor Hallier. In order to test the presence

or absence of microzymes in contagious or healthy liquids and tissues, the method
was adopted of cultivatino; these organisms in soils suitable for their growth, and

under conditions favourable to their multiplication and development. By the

enormous reproductive power of these organisms, and the changes which they
induce in the organic liquids in which they are cultivated, the presence of micro-
zymes can be most satisfactorily determined. The organic liquids employed as
soils were chiefly Pasteur's solution and albuminous liquids, such as serum, kc.
Before using these liquids as tests, however, it had first to be sho-^vn that tliey do
not, in themselves, contain the conditions of evolution. For this purpose the
liquids were introduced into capillary tubes, and investigated under the most varied
conditions of exposure, temperature, and pressure.

   The results of numerous experiments, lasting over several months, proved satis-
factorily that when these liquids had been raised to a temperature of 150'^-200° C,
or even to 100^ C, and carefully preserved from contact from air or surfaces which
liad not been superheated, no evolution of organic fonns ever took place ; while in
the same liquids which had not been heated, but otherwise kept muler exactly the
same couditi ons, organisms were found in large numbers. The results were not
modified by any variations in the tension of the air to which the liquids were ex-
posed. Other experiments made with boiled and unboiled Pasteur's solution, in-

but much more abundantly when they were exposed than when they were pro-
tected with cotton-wool, and that in boiled solutions the growth of Pemeilliii7nwa.s
more luxuriant than in unboiled solutions under similar circumstances. Bacteria
did not appear in the boiled liquids under any circumstances. Bacteria and fungi,
therefore, seemed to differ in regard to their conditions of origin find growth. The

zymes appeared were those which had come in contact with sm-faces which had

not been superheated, or had been contaminated by water which had not been

boiled.

    Bacteria were shown not to exist in the air under ordinary circumstances. "Water
was shown to be the primary source from which the germinal particles of Bacteria
are derived, whenever they seem to originate in the organic solutions experimented
with. This conclusion was satisfactorily demonstrated by impregnating organic
solutions (which otherwise could be kept indefinitely barren of all organisms) with
a di'op or two of ordinary water, whereupon, in the course of a week, the develop-
ment of Bacteria manifested itself in the clearest manner to the naked eye. This
zymotic property («'. e. the faculty of determining the development of organic forms
in a test solution to which it is added) is not possessed by all kinds of water in a

lilce degree. Distinct degrees of opalescence (due to Bacteria chiefly) are manifested

in Pasteur's solution when eprouvettes, charged with a given quantity of boiled

Pasteur's solution, are impregnated with equal quantities of water from different

sources.

   Even ordinary distilled water was never found to be free from Bacteria germs.
This was attributed to contamination with other water, or improperly cleaned
receptacles. Filtration seems to have no appreciable influence on the zymotic pro-
perty of water. From the most careful and repeated examination of water proved
to be zj'motic, it was found that such waters often contain no elements or particles
which can be detected by the microscope. Experiments were made with optically
pure water as in the sense used by Prof. Tyndall, or so nearly optically pure, that
the electric beam in passing through it displays a blue colour ; such water obtained
by the fusion of ice was shown to be as zymotic as many other varieties of water,
which in the beam are seen to be full of light-scattering particles.

    Microzymes and their germs are deprived of vitality by thorough desiccation
they are likewise killed by peimangauate of potash, ozone, carbolic acid in the
proportion of -5 per cent, of the liquid, sulphate of quinia in the same proportion,
peroxide of hydrogen, and chlorine.

    Torula and PeniciUium, however, flourished in solutions which were fatal to Bac-

teria. When an albuminous or saccharine fluid is superheated (i, e. above 100° C),

it does not support microzjaue life.

   Experiments were made to determine whether the liquids and tissues of the
living body participate in the zymotic propertj' possessed hy microzjTnes. It was

.shown that blood, fresh tissues, m-ine, milk, white of e^^, pus from deep-seated ab-
scesses, were free from microzymes, and further, that these tissues and fluids could
be kept indefinite!j' free from all traces of decomposition if proper precautions were
taken to preserve them from external contamination.

   It was farther shown that the slightest contact with ordinary water, or surfaces
clean'ed in the ordinary manner, was sufficient to set up septic changes in theee
tissues and liquids. It was therefore concluded that if microzymes are not the
only cause of putrefaction, yet their presence is suflicieut to set it up in liquids
which otherwise manifested no tendency to septic changes. In regard to contagious
liquids, few experiments had yet been made. Only in reference to pysemic pus an
experiment had been made ; it was found full of Bacteria. From numerous fiicts
and observations made during the progress of the inquiry, it was concluded that
there is no developmental connexion between Bacteria and Torula, and that their
apparent association is merely one of juxtaposition.

   This conclusion is a direct contradiction to the botanical doctrines on which

Hallier's theory of contagion is founded.

         On the Establishment of Local Museums. By T. B. GRrEESON.

   The establishment of local museums was pointed out as a means of giving a taste
for learning and science to the people, for which, in the smaller towns and rural
districts, there was no provision. Collections could readily be made ; and in every
disti'ict objects of interest would be met with, which a local museum would be
the means of saving and bringing to light. Persons commissioned by scientific
societies or one of the central institutions should make periodic visitations, and aid

the country, a knowledge of science would exist among the people, of which they
are at present altogether destitute. The author entered upon some details of the

system he proposed.

On the Cultivation of Ipecacuanha in the Edinhurgh Botanic Garden for trans-

          mission to India. By Professor Balfoxte, F.R.SS. L. ^ E.

   Ipecacuanha is a valuable remedy for dysenter}', and has been administered in

large doses with decided benefit by medical men in India. The cultivation of the

plant, however, owing to the rashness or carelessness of collectors and other
causes, has failed to a certain extent in South America ; and unless means can be

taken for more extended cidtivation, it seems probable that the quantity of Ipeca-
cuanha might be insufficient for medicinal purposes, and its price might rise in
the market to such an extent as to interfere with its general use. In these
circumstances the Secretaiy of State for India (His Grace the Duke of Argyll)
applied to the Directors of the Botanic Gardens in Britain with the view of

ascertaining whether a sufficient stock of plants could be procured for exportation

to India with the view of cultivation there for medicinal purposes. In the Edin-

burgh Botanic Garden there were some specimens of the plant which had been

cultivated for forty years or more, and it was found by Mr. M'=Nab that these
Acould be easily multiplied by making sections of the root or rhizome.
                                                                             descrip-

tion of the method pursued was read to the Botanical Society of Edinburgh, and

separate copies were printed for the use of the India Office. The plant in the

Garden was the same as that described by Sir William Hooker, and figured in the

' Botanical Magazine.' The supply from this source was obviously not sufficient

for the purposes which tire India Office had in ^iew, and the time required for
propagation would be too long. Accordingly, Professor Balfour and Dr. Christison

wrote to a previous Graduate of the University of Edinburgh, Dr. Gunning, re-

siding at Palmeiras, near Rio Janeiro, and induced him to take an interest in the

matter. He entered cordially into their proposals, and very soon sent to the

Botanic Garden boxes containing fresh plants. Although several of them suffered

in the transit, owing to the mode of packing and the want of attention during the

voyage, still a considerable number reached the Garden in a state fit for propaga-

tion after the method pursued by Mr. M^Nab. By this process a large stock of

between 200 and 300 plants was secured. Of these, a considerable number have
Abeen transmitted to India successfully in a Wardian case.
                                                            figure of this case was

given in Mr. M'^jSTab's published report. By the method employed, the small pots

containing the plants were carefully secured, so that the case might even be turned

upside do-mi without injury*. The plant sent by Dr. Gunning differs in some

particulars from that formerly in cultivation in the Botanic Garden, more espe-

cially as regards the form of its leaves. The old plant has leaves of a firmer

texture, more or less elliptical, and somewhat wavy at the margin, and the stem

suffi'uticose. The plant also flowers readily after a year's growth. The recent

plant sent by Dr. Gunning resembles more the form figured by Martins. Its

leaves are more delicate and pointed, its stem not so shrubby, and it has not yet

produced flowers. There may be two varieties of the plant. The full determina-

tion of this must be reserved till the Eio Janeiro plants come into flower.

The drawings which were exhibited show the character of both varieties, so

far as they can be at present represented from the specimens in the Botanic
Garden. The drawings show the fomi of the leaves and stems, the character of

the stipides and glands, the stomata and hairs of the leaves, and the microscopical

structure of the stems and rhizomes.

The subject has been brought under the notice of the Meeting with the view of

calling attention to the cultivation of a plant which, like Cinchona, is highly

    After studying the subject for nearly four years, during travels through all parts

of the country to the west of the Rocky Mountains, Dr. Brown considered that
instead of one homogenous flora in North-west America there are in reality five, viz.
(1) The great flora of the region to the west of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada
Mountains. (2) The flora between this range and the Rocky Mountains. (3) The
Montane flora on the summits of the mountains about 4000 feet, chiefly arctic.
(4) The flora of the Colorado descent. (5) The Athabascan flora, or the flora to

the coimtry.

   Except that the tissues are less indurated, the general structure of the stem and

the arrangement of the fibro-vascular bundles resemble that met with in palms.
The bundles, however, are somewhat remarkable from containing vessels which be-

long to the scalariform type. In a ti-ansverse section these bundles are seen to be-

come smaller towards the circumference and more condensed, forming a well-de-
fined boundary to the narrow cortical portion of the stem. The bundles are, how-

ever, continued through the cortical portion, but are reduced to little more than a

thread of prosenchyma. In the cortex there are numerous large cells containing

raphides : these also occur in the rest of the stem, but are less frequent. Crystals

of another kind are found in connexion with the fibro-vascular bundles. These are

Acontained each in a square-shaped cell, forming part of a string or chain.  number

of these strings or chains are distributed round the circumference of each iihro-

vascular bundle ; they are especially abundant in its cortical continuation, as they
do not suffer a degradation proportionate to that of the other constituent tissues.
This peculiar arrangement ot crystal-bearing cells seems probably unique. The

crystals are four-sided prisms with pyramidal apices. They are almost certainly
composed of calcium oxalate, though they are too minute and isolated with too much

difficulty to allow of their satisfactory examination.

  On the so-called 'Mimicry ' in Plants. By W. T. Thiselton Dter, B.A.,

     B.Sc, Professor of Botany in the Itoyal College of Science for Ireland.

   In all large natural families of plants there is a more or less distinctly observable
general habit or fades, easily recognizable by the practised botanist, but not always
as easily to be expressed in "words. The existence of such a general habit in legu-
           TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                            129

miuous and composite plants is familiar to every one. What have been hitherto

spoken of as mimetic plants are simply cases where a plant belonging to one family
puts on the habit characteristic of another. This is entirely different from mimicry
among animals, inasmuch as the resembling plants are hardly ever foimd with those
they resemble, but more usually in widely different regions. Mtitisia speciosa from
Western South America, a Composite, has a scandent leo;uminous habit closely

agreeing with that oi Lathyrus maritimiis of the European shores. In the same way

three different genera of ferns have species (found in distant parts of the world) in-
distinguishable in a barren state. The term Mimicrj^ seems objectionable in these

cases, and the author proposes Pseudomorphism as a substitute. As to the cause of
the phenomenon, he can only suggest that the influence of similar external circum-

stances moulds plants into the similar form most advantageous to them. An illus-

tration is aflTorded by the closely resembling bud scales which are found in widely se-
pai-ated natural orders of deciduous trees as modifications of stipules. The author

does not, however, think that the moidding influence need always be the same.

He believes that different external conditions may produce the same result ; in
this respect they may be called analogous. Several identical plants are found on

the sea-shore and also on mountains perhaps the reason is that they are equally
                                                                                                                                                                                ;

able to tolerate the effect of soda salts and also of mountain climate. The tolerance
of either unfavourable condition gives them the advantage over less elastically

constituted plants, and both are therefore analogous in their effects.

  Oa Spiranthes Eomanzoviaua, Cham. By A. 0. Moee, F.L.S., M.R.I.A,

   In exhibiting some living specimens of this rare Irish orchid, Mr. More called

attention to their delicious perfume. He had gathered the plant near Castletown,

Berehaven, where it was in full flower about the l-5th of July. It grows in grassy
meadows, and also in rather boggy ground bordering on the sea, and is found in so
many different fields that there is no present fear of its becoming extinct.

                  On Erioplioruin alpinum, Linn., as a British Plant.

                                Bij A. G. Moee, F.L.S., M.R.I.A.

   Eriophorum alpimnn had, a few years ago, been annoimced as an Irish plant on

faith of some specimens forwarded to Dr. Moore by Mr. J. SuUivan of Cork, who

reported that they had been gathered on the banks ot a mountain-lake near Mill-
street, coimty Cork. Subsequent investigation had, however, caused considerable
doubts as to the correctness of this information ; for both Mr. More himself and
Dr. Moore had on two different occasions made a most careful search on the borders

of Gurthaveha Lake without finding a trace of Eriopliorum alpintim ; and they now

believe that Sciipus cceiipitosus, whose spikes are often slightly woolly with the
growth of the bristles, was gathered by the side of the lake, and probably some
mistake was afterwards made in transmitting the specimens, which belong to the

right plant.

   With regard to the supposed Scottish locality in Sutherland, Dr. Balfour autho-
rized him to say that he had always felt some slight doubt about the single specimen
found in his herbarium ; and this doubt was much increased on seeing the striking

similarity of this specimen to others also belonging to the University Herbarium,
and which were certainly collected in Forfarshire, rendering it highly probable that
a piece of E. alpinum had by some accident been mixed with Dr. Balfour's speci-
mens of Scirjnis ceespitosus, or that a label had been inadvertently exchanged.
Hence he believed that Eriophorum alpinum must, for the present, be erased alto-

gether from the British flora.

being not unfrequently found growing in animals and man, botli externally and

internally. For the most part these affected tlie skin, giving rise to several cuta-
neous diseases. They also Uom-ished in the alimentary canal ; and among others,

one peculiar form (Sarcina) had been described by the late Professor Goodsir from

the human stomach. In nearly though not in all instances where vegetable orga-
nisms flourished within the living body, it was in organs where a certain amount

of air had free access. It was more difficult to account for the cases where
vegetable parasites arose in, so to speak, closed cavities. _ The instances which the

author brought forward as coming under his observation were three in number,
viz. a fungus-like growth in the abdomino-pleural membrane of a Kittiwake gull,

Bissa tridactyla (Linn.), a great white-crested cockatoo, Cacattia crisfafa (Linn.),

and a rough-legged buzzard, Archihuteo laffopus (Gm.). After a general descrip-
mtion of the specimens in question, he referred to them as
                                                            some way bearing

upon those doctrines whereby living organisms were supposed to originate out of

the tissues themselves. Other weighty reasons imdoubtedly might be given to the

contrary ; but as every fact, either furnishing doubtful evidence of, ov opposed to

the spontaneous generation theory, might be useful at the present juncture, the

author thought a record of such worthy of being brought before the Association.

On tlie (Jlianges luMcli occur in Plants during i7ie ripening of tJte Seeds, in order
   to ensure the access of the Air and Light as well as Heat, ivhich are generally

    requisite for this purpose, without the loss of the Seeds before the ripening

   is completed. Bg J. Bibkbeck Kevins, M.B. Lond., F.B.S. Ed.

   In the poppy the capsule becomes erect because the valves are at the summit of
the seed-vessel, whilst in Campanulacea3 the seed-vessels droop, because the valves
are at the base of the capsule, except in the case of the C. persicifolia, which has
an erect capsule, the valves being at the summit.

   In the PrimulaceaJ the di-ooping flower becomes an erect capsule in ripening,
except in the Cyclamen, which ripens its seed in the ground, and therefore droops
imtil the capsule is buried in the earth, after which its capsule opens at its apex
downwards. The AnagaUis, which has always a closed seed-vessel, ripens with the

capsule in various directions.

   In the Stellarias, which are summer flowers, the flower is erect, as well as the
capsules, the period of inflorescence being favourable to ripening. And in Compo-
sites, which flower in summer, the same is observed ; whilst in the Coltsfoot and the
African marigold, which ripen their seeds under difficulties, various changes of
position occur, to shelter the immature seeds from injury from the weather. The
Kanuuculacefe, IMalvacere, Scrophulariacese, and several others were passed under
review, and their various changes pointed out, which had the object in view of

promoting the ripening of the seeds without prematiu-e loss from the seed-vessels.

      On the Nature of tlie Crucferous fruit, with reference to the Replum.

                 By J. BiEKEECK Nevins, M.D. Lond., F.B.S. Ed.

   The replum is a direct prolongation of the stem, which produces the seeds
without the intervention of cai-peUary leaves ; as is also the case in the Coniferie.
After ha^^ug produced the seeds, the stem bears two leafy organs, which are directed
downwards, and adhere by their apices to the stem, below the point from which the
seeds spiing, and thus close in the seed-vessel, which therefore consists of a stem

bearing the seeds (the replum) and two external leafy organs (the valves). When

ripening commences, the apices of these deflected leaves separate from the stem,
until at last they are entirely detached, and fall ofl' at their articidation with the
stem, leaving the seeds still adherent along the edges of the stem in four rows.

The replum is therefore not a dissepiment derived in any way from the carpellary

leaves, out simply a seed-bearing stem, flattened and thinned in the central part
(the pith) until it is transparent. In accordance with this view, the venation of the
valves is that of a leaf turned downwards, being directed towards the base of the
                                                                           ;

The term " false " dissepiment is therefore no longer necessary, the fruit being a
normal growth, though of an unusual construction.

On the Classijication of the Vascular Cryptogamia, as affected by recent Dis-

   coveries amongst the Fossil Plants of the Coal-measures. By W. C. William-

   son, F.R.S., Professor of Natural History in Owens College, Manchester.

   The author described the structure of the stem of Calamite explaining, his inter-

pretation of its structure, viz. that it consisted of a central fistular medulla, sur-

rounded by a ring of woody wedges, each one of which grew by additions to the
exterior of its surface until it often became a woody cvlinder of considerable thick-
ness. The Lepidoilendra and Siffillarice were next reviewed, beginning with Lepi-
(hdendra, in which the central axis was a mixture of cells and vessels surrounded
by a very thin, and often scarcely appreciable ligneous ring, and which gave off
vascular bundles to the leaves. Other forms were then noticed in which the central
medulla became differentiated into a central cellular portion, and an outer vascular
one, the latter existing as a modified medullary sheath. One of the types described
by Mr. Binney as Sigillaria vascularis, exhibits these features; and the development
was traced still further through Diploxylon and Sigillaria, where the woody zone
became yet more fully developed, the medullary rays more distinct, and the dif-
ferentiation of the two elements of the pith, viz. the vascular and the cellular, yet
more complete. The origin of the vascular bundles going to the leaves in some
forms of Diploxylon was shown to be, not in the medullary vessels, as described by

Corda, but in a cellular layer separating the ring of the medullary vascular cylinder

from the more external vascular cylinder of the true woody zone. The relation of
these various structures to those seen in Stigmaria was pointed out. In the latter,
as was to be expected in a root, the vessels of the meduUary axis disappeared, the
pith being in direct contact with the inner surface of the woody zone. The
vascular bundles given off to the rootlets were shown to originate in the ligneous
cylinder, and to pass outwards through large lenticular spores, occupied by mural
cellular tissue, separating the woody wedges, whilst in addition to these spores,
there exist a complete system of minor medullary rays, the entire structure ex-

hibiting, in the author's opinion, an exogenous arrangement.

   The conclusion to be drawn from the study of the structure of these fossil cryp-
togamic stems is, that, so far as their medullary axis and ligneous zone is concerned,
they are not in any sense Acrogens, but Exogens ; that they have a pith consisting
of the less developed Lepidodendroid forms of a mixture of cells and vessels ; that
as we ascend in the series of forms the cells become separated from the vessels, the
former occupying the interior, and the latter the exterior of the medullary axis
that the woody zone surrounding the medullary axis consists of a cylinder com-
posed of radiating lines of A'essels, which increase by successive additions to the
external surface of the zone, the laminre of which vessels are separated by mural
arrangements of cellular tissue constituting two kinds of medullary rays ; con-
sequently when such a process of growth has gone on until the result was a tree
with a stem two, three or more feet in diameter, the application of the term

   The Zooloyical Results of the Dredging Expedition of the YacJit 'Noma ' off
        the Coast of Spain and Portugal in 1870. By W. Savili.e Kent.

     The expedition was organized and superintended by Mr. Marshall Hall, the
 owner of the yacht, Mr. Kent accompanying him to supervise the collection and

  preservation of natural-history specimens, as also to report on all the novelties

  or objects of interest that might be obtained. The sponges collected during the
 expedition appear to have furnished the greater number of forms new to science,
  embracing more particularly many new representations of the group to which tho
  beautiful Euplcctella, or " Venus's flower-basket," and the "Glass-rope sponge,"
  Ilyaloncma, belong, the latter, indeed, being amongst the spoils. All these_ forms
  were dredged in' the deep-sea fishing ground, 400 to 800 fathoms, oft' Cezimbra,
  at the mouth of the Sado river ; and from the same locality, with the assistance
  of the native fishermen, they had the good fortune to secure examples of several
  rare species of deep-sea ground sharks which frequent that coast line, including
  among others Pneiidotriakis 7)ucrodon, a species recently described by Professor
  Barboza du Eocage, of the Lisbon Museum. Fiisvs contrariiis and a species of
  Cassis allied to C. saburon are among the rarer shells referred to by Mr. Kent,
  the former being interesting on account of its identity with a common fossil of
  the Norwich Crag, and the latter from its affinities with Japanese and Chinese
  species rather jthan with uny known Atlantic or Mediterranean form. The occur-
  rence in the same waters of a variety of Ilyaloncma, scarcely to be distinguished
  from the well-known Japanese H. Sieboldi, is also commented upon by Mr. Kent,

   as illustrating another instance of this singul.ar distribution of allied species.

   Keviewing the whole amount of material collected during the cruise, Mr. Kent
   separates it into two portions, presenting respectively two entirely distinct facies.
  The first of these, including that collected from the shore line down to a depth
   of 100 fathoms, presents an interblending of Mediterranean species with those in-
  habiting our own more temperate coasts : while the remaining one, embracing all
   those acquired at a depth of from 400 to 800 fathoms, are remarkable for their
   boreal or cold-water area aspect and affinities, and in this respect, according to Mr.
   Kent, entirely supporting the deductions arrived at by Dr. Carpenter, from his ex-
   tensive study of the fauna of these great depths in connexioji with the expeditions

   of the ' Lightning ' and ' Porcupine.' Among the more interesting Mediterranean

   forms taken, especial mention is made of Dendrophyllia rainea, a massive branching

    coral, not before recorded as occurring so far north, as also of various species of
   MureXf Calappa gramdata, Cesttan veneris^ and other zoophytes usually supposed to

be restricted to the more southern arc. Mr. Kent expresses his hope that the entire

success attending this cruise may influence other yacht-owners to follow the ex-

ample of Mr. Marshall Hall, and, like him, to devote their craft for the portion of a
season to scientific discovery, promising them they will find themselves more than

compensated for the sacrifice of time or other interests it may involve by the fasci-
nating nature of the work when entered upon, in addition to their thereby earning
for themselves the lasting gxatitude of the scientific world. The Royal Society
granted £50 towards aiding in the necessary outlay in di-edging and preser%-ing

apparatus. The paper constitutes a brief sketch of a report to be presented to the
Royal Society by Mr. Kent.

                               Bij A. G. MoEE, F.L.S., M.E.I.A.

   In the sixth volume of his Catalogue of Fishes (Addenda, page 357), Dr. Giin-
ther has noticed the fact that Salmofario frequently descends to the sea, and there
" assumes a bright silvery coloration, with numerous x-shaped spots." The cir-

cumstance did not, however, seem to have met with so much attention as it de-
serves, and was very little known to anglers and fishermen. In Scotland, Mr.
Peach, who had an extensive experience and knowledge of marine zoology, had
assm'ed him that no instance of the kind had come under his notice, save once,
when he found a river-trout in the stomach of a cod-fish. But in the west of
Ireland (in the counties of Donegal, Sligo, Limerick, and Kerrj') Mr. More had
ascertained, partly through others and partlj' from his own observation, that the
river-trout in many places spontaneously frequents the salt water at the mouth of
the rivers. The brown trout captured in salt water difter from their usual condi-
tion in having brighter and more silvery scales, something like those of the young
salmon in the smolt condition ; but he had not noticed any increase in the number
of dark x-shaped spots. Mr. More would like it to be ascertained if these trout
were brown trout " pure and simple," or hj'brids. Specimens were exhibited.

   A[r. More exhibited a number of marine animals, which he had lately collected

      On tlie so-called Tailless Trout of Islay. By C. W. Peach, A.L.S.

   Mr. Peach stated that the trout he showed were sent to him by Mr. Colin Hay,
distiller, of Ardbeg Islay, taken in Loch Namaorachin, about ]000 feet above the

level of the sea ; it is supposed to be the highest in the island. It is about an acre

in extent, and so .shallow that a man can wade through it ; the bottom is quartz

rock, like that of the mountains around it. Several other lochs are near it in
which trout are plentiful, but none " tailless." So constant is this that Mr. M'^Kay,
a very keen fisher, has never for the thirty years of his fishing-experience in this

loch taken any but "docked" ones. Mr. Peach further said that Mr. Hay was

about to stock a loch at some distance from Loch Namaorachin with some of the
" tailless " trout, in which, up to the present time, no trout have been taken, and
thus to try whether this " docked " appearance will contioue, and use other

means to work out as far as possible the histoiy of this strange freat. He added
that they could not be called altogether " tailless ; " docked they may be, from not

having a vestige of the external caudal fin-rays. The fish were in splendid con-
dition, and the whole of the other fins perfect ; and in every other respect nothing-
was wanting, as could be seen by the specimens shown, and by the beautiful ske-
leton of one prepared by Mr. Stirling, assistant to Professor Turner*.

 Remarks on a favourable occasion for the estahlishment of Zoological Obser-

                vatories. By P. L. ScLATEE, M.A., Ph.D., F.R.S.

   After alluding to the report of the Committee of the British Association for the
establishment of zoological observatories, which had been read by the author at a
previous meeting of the Section, attention, was called to the fact that a veiy favour-
able opportimity for the establishment of three zoological observatories in very
little-known parts of the globe would shortly present itself, and it was greatly to be
hoped that advantage would be taken of it.

   On the occasion of the transit of Venus in 1874, the Astronomer Royal proposes

--to organize observing-expeditions to the following five stations : (1) Oahu, Sand-

wich Islands, (2) Kerguelen's Island, (.3) Rodriguez, (4) Auckland, New Zealand,

(5) Alexandria. At the first three of these stations (Oahu, Kerguelen's Island,
and Rodriguez) it would be necessary to have a corps of scientific observers resi-
dent for twelve months previous to the transit, in order that the absolute longi-
tudes of these places, which were not correctly known, might be obtained. The
author pointed out how little was yet known of the terrestrial and marine zoology

of these three islands, and specified various particulars, in the case of each of their

faunas, which it would be especially desirable to investigate. He then urged that

the addition of one or more zoological collectors, or observing-naturalists, to the
corps of astronomical observers in each of these stations would occasion very slight
additional expense, and suggested that application should be made to the Govern-
ment to permit such natm-alists to accompany these expeditions, and to undertake
the necessary expenditure.

iu -wliicli an animal closely resembled either some part of a plant or some

inorganic object ; and expressed the opinion that these two sets of cases were

wholly one iu kind, the evident object iu all being the protection of the imitator.

Describing a visit paid to the vicinity of Grahamstown in search of this insect, he

observed that it was a work of considerable difficulty to distinguish the gi-asshoppers

from the stones, and he was engaged for half an hour in careful search over a known

station of the species before discovering an example. lie noted the further most

interesting fact, that, in certain spots (often only a few square j-ards iu extent)

where the stones lying on the ground were darker, lighter, or more mottled tlian

those generally prevalent, the Trach/petra found among such stones varied similarly

from the ordinary dull ferruginous-brown colouring in imitation of them. It was

pointed out that the close imitation of the stones was mainly effected by the modi-

fication of the dorsal shield of the prothorax, which is (with the whole thorax) much

flattened and widened, and is fm-ther much produced posteriorlj^, and has its sur-

face roughened or granidated in close resemblance to the surface of the stones.

In conclusion, he called attention to the bearing of the case of tliis insect on the

question of the origin  of  species                              and  iu putting the  alternative whether the pe-

culiar station of the Trachypetra had been specially prepared for it immediately

before or simultaneously with the creation of the insect, or whether, on the contrary,

the insect had Ijeen very gradually modified by natural selection in imitation of the

stones for the pm-pose of concealment, he expressed his decided opinion in favour of

the latter hypothesis.

Specimens of the insect were exhibited in association with some of the stones

among which they were captured ; aud the very close resemblance between the

stones and the insects was very obvious. Mr. Trimen observed that in nature the

mimicrj' was more effective, the colours of the dead insects having faded consider-

ably, and the shrinking of the abdomen having caused the hind legs to be much

more apparent than was the case in living examples.

      Les CJiauves-souris de Tepoque du Mammouth et de Vepoque actuelle.
                              Par Professeur Van Beneden.

   La thi^orie de Darwin est, dit-on, une veritable conception scientifique, fondee

8ur la concurrence vitale et la selection naturelle. L'evohitiou uaturelle des
formes est pour le savant illustre le r6sultat de la lutte pour la vie et de la sm--
vivance des plus forts.

   Si les animaux subissent la loi de cette concurrence vitale et de la stSlection
naturelle, il faut se demander quel est I'effet de cette influence pendant la piSriode

actuelle.

   Pendant ce long laps de temps qui nous si^pare de I'age du Mammouth et de

rOiu's des cavernes, quelles sont les modifications qui sont survenues dans le nombre
comme dans les caracteres des especes ? S'aperfoit-on des effets de la lutte pour la
vie et, comme consequence, de la survivance des plus forts ? C'est la question que
nous avons voulu examiner.

   On est generalement d'accord sur ce point que, pour expliquer les ph<5nomene8

des temps g^ologiques, il faut chercher la solution dans les phi^uomenes de I'epoquo
actuelle. Ce qui se passe sous nos yeux doit nous fairo comprendre ce qui s'est

pass6 anterieurement.
    C'est cette pensee que vient d'exprimer avec tant d'eMgance I'illustre President

de 1'Association, Sir William Tliomson, dans son discours d'ouverture : L'essence
de la science consiste a d(§duire de ph6nomenes actuellemeut soumis a I'observa-
tion I'etat anterieur des choses, et a prejuger lem-s evolutions futures.

   Nous avons eti conduit a nous occuper de ces questions a la suite de recherches

sm'les parasites des Oheiropteres (Chauves-somis) et d'explorations faites dans les
cavernes. Nous avons compare des animaux, vivant autour de nous et dans nos

grottes, avec ceux qui hantaient autrefois ces memes lieux a I'epoque oil les Ours
et les Rennes remplissaient ces retraites de leurs depouilles.

contr^es et qui ont emigi-e ; la secoude ceiix qui sont resti^s en vie dans les niemes
localit(5s ; la troisieme ceux qui ont disparu et que Ton ue connait que par leurs

d(5pouilles plus ou moins bien conservees. Toutes les especes de grande taille ont

quitte ces lieux et appartiennent a la premiere et a la troisieme categories. On

pent dire que c'est la presence de I'homme qui les a eloignes. Les petits seuls ont
continue a vivre a cote de I'Lomme. L'homnie est le maitre des grands, mais il
subit la loi des petits. Nous faisons fuir I'Elepliant et le Lion, mais nous ne

parvenons pas plus a chasser les Rats et les Souiis que les parasites du corps ou les

infusoires de I'eau et de I'air.

Les petites especes qui ont continue a vivre dans nos contr^es sont, les una her-

bivores, les autres carnassiers ou insectivores.

Parmi les carnassiers se trouvent le Loup, le Eenard, le Blaireau, la Loutre, la

Fouine, le Putois, la Belette parmi les insectivores, independamment du H^risson,
                                                                                                                                                           ;

de la Taiipe et des Musaraignes, les difft5rentes especes de Chauves-soims.

Ce sont ces demiers Insectivores que nous avons cboisis pour elucider la question

qui nous occupe. Les Chauves-souris sont en eflet les plus propres a cette 6tude,

puisqu'elles sont soumises toutes au meme regime, qu'elles ont le meme genre de

vie, et que, plus que tout autre animal, elles sont completement sous I'intluence des
changements de temptlrature. Nulle part la concurrence vitale n'a du etre plus

puissante que cbez des animaux qui ont du traverser des periodes de froid et qui

ne trouvent des insectes pour pature, qu'a I'opoque des clialeurs. D'autre part, il

n'y a pas d'animaux, vivant autour de nous, aussi completement independants que

les Chauves-souris, et, par consequent, plus propres a subir les efFets de la selection

naturelle.

Schmerling avait di^ja trouv6 de nombreux restes de ces animaux, a cot^ des

ossements d'Ours, de Lion, et de Renne, mais il n'a pas eu le temps de distinguer
les especes et de les comparer. Nous avons pu combler cette lacune et compltitcr

ces recherches par les observations que nous avions en porte-feuille sur les Chauves-

souris des grottes de Furfooz.

   Nous pouvons garantir avec Schmerling que les os de Chauves-souris que nous

avons recueillis, sont fossiles au meme titre que les autres animaux enfouis, et que
lour enfouissement date de la meme epoque.

   Nous avons fait des recherches sur les diverses especes qui vivent dans les

cavernes ; nous avons (5tudit5 chaque espece, et pr(?par(5 leurs os en tenant compte de
I'age et du sexe, et nous avons reuni tout ce que les explorations ont pu nous four-

nir pour la comparaison ; il est resulte pour nous de I'etude compart5e des especes

vivantes et fossiles, que les Chauves-souris qui vivent aujourd'hui dans les grottes,

sont exactement les memes que celles qui y vivaient a I'epoque des Ours, et que les

raemes especes y ont conserve leur demeure les unes a c6t6 des autres sans le

moindre changement. Dans tel endroit on trotive priucipalement le Grandfer-a-

cheval (li/iiitofopJtus fcrrum-cquimnn), dans tel autre endroit le Fetit fcr-a-cJwval

(lihuwlvplnts Jiippocrepis)                                                                                                                  ici c'est le Dasi/anme  (Vespcrtilio dasycnejmts), la c'est
                                                                                                                                          ;

le MyHacin {VcspertiUo viystacimts), le Murin (J^espeiiilio murinus) ou tOreilhird

{Plerotus aurifus). Si les eaux envahissaient aujourd"hui, comme elles I'ont fait

autrefois, la retraite de ces animaux, et que leurs ossements fussent conserves, on

trouverait dans le limon exactement les memes especes qu' autrefois.

Elles sont tellement semblables les unes aux autres, que celles qui se trouvent le

plus abondanmient aujourd'hui, sont aussi celles qui ont laiss^ le plus de debris.

  En un mot, aucun changement n'est sur-\-enu dans les diverses e.speces de Chauves-

souris. La concurrence vitale n'a produit d'effet ni sm- le nombre ni sur la taille

tons ces animaux sont restes exactement ce qu'ils ^talent a I'epoque ou I'Ours

foulait notre sol a cote du Mammouth et du Renne.

Que Ton compare euti''eux les os des grandes especes ou des petites, des fortes

ou des faibles, on voit qu'elles se sont toutes maintenues dans les niemes condi-

tions                      chaque espece a sa maniere de faire la chasse, choisit les lieux et le moment
                        ;

de s'y livrer, et conserve sa place au crepuscule.

Et ce que nous observons dans les Chauves-souris, nous le constatons (Sgalement

plus de difference si on les compare avec ceux d'aujoiud'hui, que les poissons, les

   La concurrence vitale existe, maia la liitte entre individus ne produit aucim

eft'et sur I'espece ; la sdlection naturelle conduit, d'apres nous, nou a I'altt^ration in-
sensible des types spi^cifiques, niais, au contraire, a la conservation du uioule de
chacun d'eux dans toute sa purete.

   Que I'ou compare cent tetes de Renard, de Putois ou de Fouine, animaux
abandonnes completement a leur libre instinct, c'est a peine si, en tenant compte
de I'age et du sexe, on trouve quelque difference. La taille meme est parfaite-
ment semblable. Que I'ou compare au contraire cent tetes d'animaux domes-

tiques, d'animaux qui ont subi la contrainte de I'liomme, qui ont ^te sous le jouf^ de

la selection artiJicieUc, qui ont acceptt? la nom-riture et le gite sans faire choix a
I'cpoque du i"ut et il n'y aura pas deux tetes semblables.

   La selection naturelle, loin de produire des modifications qui ameneront la for-

mation d'especes nouvelles, n'a d autre effet, a notre avis, quand elle est vraiment
naturelle, que la conservation du type dans toute sa purett5 primitive. L'instinct

qui pousse chaque espece a Taccomplissement de ses fonctions est la sauvegarde de

sa conservation.

   Nous terminerons, en faisant remarquer que si les animaux qui ont i& aussi
completement soimiis a I'influence de la concurrence vitale et de la selection naturelle,

depuis I't^poque du Mammouth et de I'Ours des cavernes jusqu'au jour d'aujom-d'

hui, si ces animaux, disons-nous, apres ce long laps de temps ne presentent aucun
changement, aucune modification, ni dans le nombre, ui dans la forme, ni dans la
taille, nous nous demandons si on est en droit d'iuvoquer la loi de selection basee
sur la concurrence vitale pour expliquer la formation des especes. Nous le r^p6tons,
une tli(5orie, pour etre scientifique, doit etre basee sur des phdnomenes qui s'accom-
plissent dans les temps actuels, et dont nous pouvons etre temoins.

    II ne sera pas hors de propos de faire remarquer qu'a une iSpoque g^ologique de la
periode primaire, un fait analogue a i^te observe par le naturaliste le plus autorisd

peut-etre qui a ^crit siu- les Trilobites. Sur .350 especes de Trilobites, dit M. Ear-
rande, dans un ri^suui^ de ses travaux sur ce groupe intdressant d'animaux, dix sont

variables, mais ces variations ne portent que sur la taille, la grosseur des yeux, le
nombre correspondant des lentilles, le nombre d'articulations visibles au Piyidium
et le nombre de pointes ornemeutales.

   Ces variations sont purement temporaires, et M. Barrande a constatd dans la plu-
part des cas, le retour a la forme typique ou primitive. Les variations ne semblent
etre que des oscillations transitoires.

   Aucune des 350 especes n'a produit une nouvelle forme sp^cifique distincte et
permanente. Les traces de transfm-mation par vote de Jiliation sont completement

imperceptibles.

    Plusieurs zoologistes et paldontologistes qui se sont occup^s d'autres gi-oupes, et

d'autres epoques g^ologiques, sont arrivt's au meme r^sultat apres de longuea

rechercbes et de patientes comparaisons.

   Le meme pb^uomene se pr^sente done a I'epoque primaire et a I'cpoque actuelle,

et nous ne voyons pas que la concurrence vitale et la selection naturelle aient pro-

duit quelque part une nouvelle forme que Ton soit en di'oit de consid^rer comme lo

resultat de la filiation.

 On the Pressure of tTie AtmosjJiere as an Attxiliary Force in carryinrj on the

              Circulation of the Blood. By Professor A. Bttchanan.

   The author holds that the pressure of the atmosphere, rendered effective by the
dilatation of the chest and of the heart, is an auxiliary to the propulsive force of
the heart so indispensable, that without it the circulation of the blood cannot go en
for more than three and a half minutes.
138 REPORT-- 1871.

   The author clescrihecl two experiments bearing on this subject. The apparatus
required for each of them is an elastic bulb, furnished with valves, which enable
it to act like a pump. To the opening, by which the liquid enters, there is attached

a ilaccesccnt tube, such as a portion of a sheep's intestine. If the extremity of this

tube is dipped into water, and the pump, held verticaDy, is set into action, no water
rises in the tube. This is Dr. Arnott's famous experiment, which led him to declare
that " it is a physical impossibility that a sucking action of the chest or heart can
be a cause of the blood's motion in the veins." Dr. Arnott's interpretation of this
experiment has caused the doctrine advocated by the author to be ostracised in this

country.

   In the second experiment the action of the pump is assisted by that of a column

of liquid, which is obtained by attaching the free end of the intestine to an apcr-

tm-e in the bottom or side of the water-cistern, and keeping the pump constantly
beneath the level of the water. The pump was now shown to act with the most

perfect facility, and without any risk of the collapse of the intestine, which is kept
constantly distended by the pressm-e of the column of water. The author argued
that the blood-vessels are in like manner kept distended by the pressm-e of the
blood resulting from the propulsive force of the heart, and explained that if the
column of water were about ten inches in height, it would then exert a force equal
to tlie distending force with which the veins entering the chest are kept patent by

the force of the heart.

   The author then proceeded to illustrate his theoiy by reference to the phenomena
attendant upon inspiration and expiration, the pulse, the condition of the I'uetal
circulation, and asphyxia.

   An Exjieiimenial Inqulnj into some of the Results of Inoculation in the
                      lower Animals. By John' Chiene, M.D.

   The author related shortly the results of a series of experiments in which rabbits
were inoculated with cancerous matter obtained from the human subject. In the
great majority of cases the matter was introduced below the skin. The general

--result of the investigation may be summed up as follows : In rabbits the inocu-

lation of cancerous matter, obtained (1) from post-mortem examinations, (2) from
tumours removed by the sm-geon, (3) directly from the growing tumour during
life, does not produce cancer, but a local form of cystic formation of a scrofulous
type, which does not materially difter from the appearances seen after inoculation
of the rabbit with tubercle, or after the introduction of any irritant. Subsequent
disease of internal organs is rare. The local disease has a tendency to heal either
by conti'action or by suppuration. In no case did death follow as a result of the
inoculation. In two cases in which rabbits were inoculated from a lymphoma, both
died in consequence of the virulence of the local inflammation, which was accom-
panied by the deposit of a large cake of cheesy matter.

                            By Professor W.* H. Flower, F.R.S.

    This commimication was illusti-ated by the exhibition of the bones of the caqjus

of a dog, six weeks old, in which the so-called scap/io-haiar bone consisted of three

distinct ossifications, one corresponding to the radiale or scaphoid, one to the into--

medium or lunar, and one to the os ce»trale of the typical carpus. The same

arrangement was found on both sides of the body. It is diflerent from what has

previously been observed, and shows that in some of the Camivora at least neither

of the three above-named elements of the normal carpus are suppressed ; neither

are they connate, but they are all developed indepcudentlj', and afterwards coalesce

to  form  a  single     bone.

         On the Uses of the Uvula. By Sir Duncan Gibb, Bart., M.D.

   The axithor commenced by saying that the true functional uses of the uvula had
never been wholly understood, and then entered into a description of its composition,
situation, and relation to neighbouring muscles. Anatomists describe the action
of the u\-Tilar muscle as an elevator, and as therefore shortening- the uvula. It is,
however, a sentinel to the fauces, especially in the act of deglutition ; for when any
substance comes into contact with it, it excites the action of all the neighboimng
muscles until that is got rid of. But it possesses a function of not less importance in
holding the soft palate tense and firm in the medial line against the wall of the
pharynx diuing the act of deglutition itself, and thus prevents the passage upwards
of fluid or solid substances behind the nose. This was supported by experiments
upon a person who had lost the bones of the nose, permitting of a view of the action
of the soft palate from its nasal aspect during deglutition, with or without food.
Under either circumstance, a double arch was seen in the form of two convex
swellings, held in a state of finn tension by the action of the uvula pressing down

the centre of the soft'palate, with its end resting flat against the wall of the pharynx.
There was the motor ttvula muscle situated superficially, like a distinct band, tied
round the soft palate in its most important resisting part, to prevent the possibility
of food passing upwards, and in this it was supported coordinately by all the

--neighbouring muscles concerned in the act of deglutition. There also was a fact

not previously known viz. the action of the uvula as a, point d'appui in holding

the soft palate tense in the middle line against the pharynx during deglutition, at
the same time that the muscle acted as a compressor of the soft palate itself. Its

tension ceased the moment that the constrictors of the pharynx had fully exerted

their influence over the substances swallowed. Whilst the uvula has its special
uses in the act of deglutition, it exerts a not less decisive influence upon the voice

mwhen uttered in a very loud tone, or in singing the higher registers, both sexes
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

then its character as a levator or shortener is exerted. If this power is impaired
by removal of the muscular (not the membranous) end, then the singing powers

are damaged. The author now described the appearance and action of the uvula

as seen in singing the higher notes, its point becoming almost invisible, and the
soft palate being drawn backwards and upwards, diminishing the space between it
and the wall of the pharjnix. The movements of the uvida are exceedingly rapid,
and vary with the continuous or quavering character of the singing notes. In the
 shakes of the voice it is seen to be undergoing a series of short ups and downs, at
 every inspiration descending, and then rapidly ascending, and keeping up until the
note, prolonged or otherwise, is finished. Some remarks were made upon elonga-
tion of the uvula and its effects, a distinction being made between its elongated
 membranous end and the true muscular tip which should not be meddled with.
 Speech, the author said, was modulated by the soft palate and uvula, and the
 motor power of the latter is unquestionably exerted in pronouncing the letters K,
 Q, and X, with their associations, more especially the gutturals of the vai-ious

--languages. He summed up the uses of the uvula as follows : ·" 1. It acts as a

 sentinel to the ftiuces in exciting the act of deglutition when anything has to be

 swallowed. 2. It compresses the soft palate and holds its posterior free border
 fii-mly against the wall of the pharynx in deglutition, so that nothing can pass up-
 wards. 3. It modifies speech in the production of loud declamation and the
 guttm-al forms of language by lessening or diminishing the pharyngo-uasal passage

 when it acts as an elevator. 4. Its elevating power is increased to the most ex-

 treme degree in the highest ranges of the singing voice, and is very moderately
 exerted in the lower ranges. 5. Therefore, in its uses, deglutition and vocalisation
 ai-e the functions that ai-e intimately associated with the uvula, and both become
 impaired more or less if it is destroyed, wholly removed, or seriously injured."

 On some Ahnorinalities of the Larynx. By Sir Duncan Gibb, Bart., M.D.

   The author described a rare instance of absence of both arytenoid cartilages in
a gh-1 of eighteen. Likewise one in which the epiglottis possessed the shape of a
trefoil leaf, and two others in boys of fissure of the same cartilage.

   All these were congenital, and were explained by means of diagrams.

   On the Existence of Ilicmocjlohin in the Muscidar Tissue, and its relation to

                    Muscular Activity. By E. Eay Lankestee.

   The author demonstrated to the Section, by means of the spectroscope, that

liajmoglobin existed in certain muscles of the gasteropodous moUusks, viz. the
active inuscles which move the lingual ribbon and lips ; at the same time the blood
of these gasteropods is entirely devoid of haemoglobin, being colourless. This was
considered a proof of the functional relation of haiinoglobin to muscular activity,

and coincided with the results attained by Ludwig, who demonstrated the absolute

necessity of the presence of oxygen in a muscle in order that it should be active

the liffimoglobiu, by its oxygen-seizing power, acts in the same way for the mus-

cular respiration as it does in those exceptional invertebrata which, living in foul
conditions, are, as the author showed, provided with liEemogiobin in their blood,

thus being enabled to accumulate what little oxygen there is present.

On the Nutrition of Muscidar and Pulmonary Tissue in Health and in
  Phthisis, tvith EemarJrs on the Colloid Condition of Matter. By William

   Maecet, M.D., F.Ii.8., late Senior Assistant Physician to the Hospital for
   Consumption and Diseases of the Chest, Bromptton, and to the Westminster

   Plospitcd, London.

The author sums up the conclusions at which he has arrived as follows :

1. Phosphoric acid and potash may be prepared artificially in the colloid state

by dialyzing a mixture of chloride of potassium and phosphate of soda.

   2. Whcaten flour, potato, and rice are found to contain respectively nearly the
same proportions of colloid phosphoric acid and colloid potash compared to the

total quantities of these substances present ; and these same proportions of phos-

phoric acid and potash are occasionally found to exist also in blood.

   3. Plants form colloid material, although they may find some ready prepared,

or in process of preparation, in the soil.

4. Muscular tissue in health is formed of three classes of substances : 1st, those

which constitute the tissue proper ; 2nd, those destined to become transformed into

the tissue proper and make up for the waste ; 3rd, those which are in process of

elimination. The first are solid and colloid, the second fluid and colloid, and the

third fluid and crystalloid ; the phosphoric acid and potash in the 3rd class of

substances occurring precisely in the proportion required to form crystalloid pyro-

phosphate of potash. This "is invariably true for the flesh of oxen, but in the

salmon the proportions do not quite agree with those of the above compound,

which appears to show that the material in progress of elimination is somewhat

less  crystalloid in fishes than in the  flesh  of  the  higher  animals                            and  this would
                                                                                                 ;

account for an accumulation of eft'ete matter in the salmon.

nutrition but this subject requires further investigation.
                                                   ;
   G. The nutrition of pulmonary tissue in health difi'ers from that of muscular

tissue, inasmuch as the proportion of phosphoric acid to the albumen in the tissue

proper, and consequently also in the nutritive material, is much higher in the lungs
than in flesh, and that of the potash in the effete material is much higher propor-

tionally to phosphoric acid in pulmonary than in muscular tissue. This excess of
potash is apparently eliminated under the form of carbonate.

   7. The nature of the chemical changes which take place within muscles in con-
sumption is the same as in health ; but these changes are lessened in degi-ee, the
amount of nutritive material supplied being diminished. Moreover, there appears

to be in muscular tissue in phthisis a beginning of that separation of water from
the solids which, imder other circumstances, only occurs some time after death.

   8. Muscular tissue in consumption contains more soda and chlorine than in a
state of health, in the mean proportion of 0117 of chlorine, and 0-239 of soda in
health, to 0-385 of chlorine and 0-446 of soda in consumption for 200 grammes of
flesh, showing apparently that the physical power of diffusion, which had been

kept in abeyance in health, begins to act in phthisis.

   9. The pulmonary organ in phthisis, when consolidated and softening, still
undergoes a process of nutrition ; but this phenomenon is different from that which

occurs in health, and becomes remarkably like the nutrition of muscular tissue.
   10. The pulpy state of the pulmonary tissue in the cheesy or softening condition,

appears to be due to an altered relation between the water and solids, the colloid
condition of the tissue being either lost or considerably diminished. The diseased
orgiin, moreovei", contains less colloid and more effete or crystalloid material than
it does in health, these several phenomena showing, as in the case of muscles, a
commencement of physical change.

   11. Finallj', death from consumption, when not due to asphyxia from deficient
action of the organs of respiration, is apparently owing to the physical power of
matter overcoming the phenomena of life, the nature of which is still a mystery,

physical changes actually commencing- before life is extinct.

  A Model of the Circulation of the Blood; by Professor RutheepouD; was

exhibited,

              Dietaries in tJie WorkJiouses of England and Wales.

By Dr. Edward Smith, F.R.S., Medical Officer of the Poor-law Board.

The author referred to the fact that schemes of dietary are agreed upon by the

combined action of the local authorities, viz. the guardians of the poor, and the

centi-al authority ; and showed that, as the dietary should correspond with that of

the labouring classes, it must vary in different localities, and be based upon local

knowledge. The dietary is thus prepared by the guardians and examined and

sanctioned by the Poor-law Board. He explained the steps wliich have recently

been taken by the latter to give advice to the former and to establish greatly im-

proved dietaries. This was initiated by the Rt. Hon. 0. P. Villiers, who first made

the appointment of medical officer to the Board, and carried into effect by the Earl

of Devon and his successors as Presidents of the Poor-law Board. It is now laid

down by that authority that the foods to be selected shall be those in ordinary use

in the several localities, and that the kind and quantity of food shall be adapted to

the wants of the several classes of inmates. The chief differences of food are found

in the quantity of meat supplied and the mode in which it is served, and in the use

of oatmeal, cheese, milk, and puddings. On many of these points the dietaries

in Dorset and "S^'^estmoreland were contrasted. Thus he showed, from inquiries

made hj him for the Government some years ago, that the quantities of food ob-

--tained by the working classes per adult weekh^ were, in Dorset bread stuffs, 13 lb.

fats, 4^ oz. ;  meat, 7^ oz. ;  milk, 12 oz. ;  and cheese, 12^ oz.                                                                        while

in Westmoreland the quantities were, bread stufls, 12^ lb. ; sugars, lOf oz.

adiilts, and the quantity of the several foods allowed in -workhouses. Children

under two years of age get milk, bread, and rice-pudding daily. From two to five

years, pudding on three days, meat and potatoes on three days, and soup or other

food on one day. From five to nine years there is one other day of meat and po-

tatoes, and commonly one of soup instead of pudding. From nine to sixteen that

of adults. For able-bodied, bread and gruel at breakfast and supper, varied by

broth or cheese in the several localities ; at dinner, meat in some form on four davs,

and pudding or cheese on three days. For aged, tea and bread and butter at break-

fast and supper                                                            at dinner, meat in some form on five days, with pudding or cheese
                                                                        ;

or other food on two days. The standard of measiu-emeut of the sufficiency of this

food is that which he gave to the Government when advising on the Lancashire

cotton-famine, viz. 4300 grains of carbon and 200 grains of nitrogen daily ; and the

model dietary which he had framed for workhouses in the Midland Counties sup-

plied more than this to the adults. He then pointed out that, whilst the above-

mentioned quantity of food supported the health and strength of tlie imnates, except'

perhaps as regards children, there are still many workhouses where the dietary is

very unsatisfactory. In some, gTuel and bread are given at breakfast and supper

to nearly all the inmates, or where meat in a separate form is not given, or where

a very small quantity, as 2 oz. or 3 oz. of raw meat was allowed two or three times

a week, or where bread and cheese alone are given to some classes in eighteen out

of twenty-one meals weekly, or where soup containing no meat is given thrice a

week, or where meat when gi^'en is given only when cold ; whilst, on the other

hand, there are workhouses in the manufacturing districts where meat and bread

are given in great excess. He was of opinion that the time may arrive when the

Government will prepare several schemes of dietary for difierent parts of the

comitry                                 but in the meantime                         improvements  are                                             now in rapid progress.  He ex-

                              large Fin- Whale. B)j Prof. STRUxnERs.

   The whale was a specimen of the Eazorback (Balcpnoptera Ifuscuhts), G4 feet in
length. It was found dead in the North Sea, off Aberdeen, and towed into Peter-
head. Searching for a rudiment of the hind limb, the author found it represented

by a bone attached by ligaments to the external process of the pelvic bone. He

found a sixteenth pair of ribs. The first rib had articulated to it a capitular process
4 to 5 inches in length. The flexor and extensor muscles of the fingers were^^arefidly

--dissected. The muscles found were the homologues of the following muscles in

man : fiexor carpi ulnaris, flexor profundus digitorum, flexor longus pollicis, ex-

tensor communis digitorum. The flexor carpi ulnaris was inserted into a distinct
and moveable pisiform cartilage. These muscles the author regarded as rudimentary
structures, whose function was not extinct but low ; not to be explained by notions
of final cause or of so-called type, but by inheritance and the influence of fimction

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

           On the Cervical Vertehrce in Cetacea. By Prof. Strtjthees.

   The paper was directed chiefly to the consideration of the various conditions of
stiffness and mobility of the vertebrae, and the various degrees of development of the
transverse processes. The seven vertebriB were present as a mammalian affinity,
and their conditions are modified by function. The surgeon gives his patient a
moveable or a stitt'joint according as he desires, by practising either rest or motion,
and the same law would no doubt act in the whale s neck. " The great ring of the

transverse processes contains a large vascular plexus, as it contains an arteiy in

man ; but that is not its meaning. It is the walls of the ring which are developed
for ligamentous and muscular attachments. The lower processes he divided into

three stages, and compared these to three stages of the corresponding parts in man.
The ligaments between the axis, atlas, and occiput had been dissected, and he
demonstrated their modifications in the whales. One of the great whales was the

Peterhead Razorback noticed in the previous paper, the other had stranded at Wick
in 1869. The Pike whale, showing the deficient parts of the bony transverse pro-
cesses to be represented by fibrous bands, had stranded at Aberdeen last year. The

next specimens exhibited were from the Narwhal, male and female.' Possibly

in adaptation to the possession of the great tusk, the vertebra were moveable,
while in the female, without the tusk, they were less moveable. The male
showed also an additional joint, on the same side as the tusk, between the atlas and
axis. Passing next to the stiff-necked whales, Prof. Sti-uthers exhibited a large
series of specimens from the Globiocephalus, obtained from the flock which stranded
near Edinburgh some years ago. They showed progressive anchylosis of the ver-
tebrte, and degeneration of the ti-ansverse processes. The younger ones showed
even the rudiments of the epiphyses of the vertebral bodies, on vertebrse themselves
rudimentary. The last neck exhibited was that of a Right whale, the interest
attaching to which was that, though probably a Greenland Right whale, it presented
more of the characters of the Right whale of the South Sea. The conclusion he
drew from the study of this neck was that the supposed differences between the
Right whale of the North and South Seas were not so fixed characters as had been
supposed.

On the Restoration of the Tail in Protopterus anneetens.
            By Professor E. H. Teaquaik, M.D.

Professor Traquair described two specimens of Protopterus annedens, in which

the external configuration and internal structure rendered it evident that a consi-

derable portion of the tail had been broken off, and that in the one case a less, and in

the_ other a gi-eater amount of restoration had taken place. In the first specimen,
which measured 8i inches in length, the body was truncated abruptly 3f inches
behind the origin of the ventral fins. This tmncated termination of the body was

fringed by a delicate membrane, projecting half an inch backwards in the middle,

and containing a pointed central axis. On dissection the abrupt truncation was

equally obvious  in  the  internal  parts                            and the  fi-inging  membrane, with its axis,
                                                                  ;

wasevidently a commencing restoration of the injured tail, the central axis con-

taining a minute newly formed notochord, lateral muscles, and spinal cord, but

there was as yet no new development of neural or hasmal arches, spines, fin-sup-

ports, fin-rays, or scales. In the second specimen, which measured 9f inches in
length, and had evidently been truncated or mutilated at a distance of about

71 inches from the tip of the snout, or If inch from the origin of the ventral

fins, the restorative process had proceeded to a much greater length. Although

the boundary between the old and new textures was sufiiciently indicated on

the outside of the fish, by the sudden diminution in the thickness of the specimen

and in the size of the scales, the outline of the posterior extremity of the animal
was very well restored, thovigh the whole tail was still proportionately shorter than

if no mutilation had taken place. The restored portion of the tail measured 2}
inches in length, and on dissection showed not only, as in the former case, a

reproduction of the notochord, but also of the neural and hasmal arches, spines, and

fin-supports, these elements remaining, however, entirely cartilaginous, and being

much more irregidarly disposed than in the normal tail. They also cease to be

traceable after 1^ inch from the commencement of the new portion of the tail,

though the notochord proceeds to its ultimate filiform termination. In addition

the spinal cord, tlie lateral muscles, and the fin-rays and their muscles were in

this specimen reproduced as well as the scales on the external surface. Both

externally and internally the line of demarcation between the old and new textures
was distinctly seen.

Notes on the Cervical Vertebrce of Steypirethyr (Balaenoptera Sibbaldii).

                              By Professor Turner.

The author described in this communication the cervical vertebrae of the large

female Steypireth}T whale stranded at Longniddry in November 1869, an account

of the soft parts of which he had given in tlie Transactions of the Royal Society of
Edinburgh, 1870. Reference was also made to the cervical vertebrtc of a large
female Steypirethyr stranded at Northmaven, Shetland, in October of the same

year, many of the bones of which are in the author's possession. The following

--are some of the principal measurements of three vertebrae of the Longniddry

Steypirethyr :

   The transverse process of the atlas was not perforated by a foramen ; those of
the 2ud, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and Gth each possessed a large oval foramen at the root.
The 7th cervical vertebra had only its superior transverse process well developed
the inferior was marked simply by a slight ridge on the body of the bone. In the
Northmaven specimen the inferior transverse process of the 6th vertebra was only
partially developed, so that it did not join the superior, and the boundaries of the
ring were imperfectly formed. The author believed that Steypu-ethjT was not an
uncommon whale on the Scottish coasts. In addition to the two specimens already

referred to as stranded in 1869, he had also identified the great whale stranded at
North Berwick in October 1831, dissected by Dr. Robert Knox, and the skeleton

of which is suspended in the Museum of Science and Art, with this species. Be-

longing also to this species was a whale stranded at Aberdour in July 1858, which
he had been able to identify from the nasal bones, which had been preserved by
Dr. JPBain. Steypirethyr is apparently the largest of the Fin-whales, and it
seems to be very doubtfid whether the common Razor-back, B. mtisculus, ever
attains the lenogth of 70 feet.

     Address to the Department of Anthropolorpj . By Professor Turner.

   As this is the first time in Scotland that an Anthropological Department has been

constituted in connexion with a Meeting of the British Association, and, indeed, as
it IS only the third time that a department of the biological section has been formed
with this title since the first one, which was instituted at the Meeting in Not-

tingliani in 1866, it may not be out of place to say a few words on the object to be

fullilled by this department, on the place which it occupies as a subdivision of the

Biological Section, and on the part which it may play in the proceedings of a body

like the British Association for the Advancement of Science. First, what sigTiifica-

tion is attached by men of science in these days to this term Anthropology ? The dis-
tinguished traveller and naturalist, Mr. A. II. Wallace, who was the first occupant

of the chair which I have now the honour to fill, in his introductory addi'ess to the

Department at the Nottingham Meeting, defined anthropology as " the science which

contemplates man under all his varied aspects (as an animal and as a moral and

intellectual being), in his relations to lower organisms, to his fellow-men, and to

the universe." It is obvious that a science thus defined is most comprehensive in

its scope, that it embraces the nature and constitution of man, physically, psychi-

cally, and morally ; the differences and resemblances between man and other or-

ganisms ; his habits and language ; his history, past, present, and future.

But, we may ask, has the term anthropology always had so wide and compre-

Ahensive a meaning as many men of science now attach to it ?  brief glance at

the history of the term will show us that this has by no means been the case, and

that the term has had a variable and progressive signification. With it, therefore,

as with so many other terms employed in science and philosophy, it will be needful

to ascertain to what school of thought a writer belonged before we can feel assured

of the exact signification he attached to it. So far as I have been able to ascertain,

the tenu, imder the form oi anthropologos, first appeared in literatru'e in the Ethics

--of Aristotle. It occiu's in a passage where Aristotle is drawing a picture of a lofty-

minded man "One who wUl not compete for the common objects of ambition,

--who wUl only attempt great and important matters who will live for his friend

alone, will bear no malice, will be no gossip (ouk anthropologos), will not be anxious

about trifles, and will care more to possess that which is fine than that which

is productive." (Grant's 'Aristotle, 2nd ed. vol. ii. p. 77.) In this passage, Aris-

totle, who had in all probability coined the term for the particular occasion, em-

--ploys it in the sense of a talker about himself and others a mere gossip. With

Iiim it had a purely personal signification, and was used to express a single phase

in the character of an individual man, and not as a term applicable to mankind in

Wegeneral.  have no knowledge, indeed, that the " science of man " had any place

assigned to it in the philosophical systems either of Aristotle or any other Greek

philosopher. For though Aristotle himself, in a higher degree than any of his

compatriots, had taken a far-sweeping survey of science and fihilosophy, and had

acquu'ed an accuracy of conception of man's moral and psychical characteristics

such as may fairly be put on a par with the results of modern investigation, yet

his knowledge of man's physical natm-e was crude and inexact. It is undoubtedly

true that he both observed, and recorded observations, on various points in human

and comparative anatomy and physiology, but these observations, owing to the

imperfection of the method pursued, were wanting in precision. Hence, not only

with Ai-istotle and his contemporaries, but so long as the Aristotelian method of

inquiry held firm sway over the minds of men, an inexactness and want of precision

in observation prevailed, which rendered it impossible to found a true science of

anthropology. Nothing, indeed, is more remarkable in the contrast between

the ancients and moderns than the comparative weakness of the former in the

sciences based on observation, experiment, and collected facts ; and in consequence

of the greater superiority of the latter in these methods of inquiiy, a division and

subdivision of the sciences has taken place in modern times, such as would not have

been even dreamed of by the ancient Greeks.

Early in the sixteenth century, when men began to emancipate themselves from

the influence so long exercised by the school of Aristotle, the term appearedagain in

literature under the form Antlu-opologemi, a purely anatomical work bearing that title

having been published in 1501 (Bendyshe's 'History of Anthropology,' p. 352); and

so late as the year 1784, Professor J. W. Baumer published at Frankfort a treatise

on human anatomy and physiology, with the title of " Anthropologia Anatomico-

Physica." By these writers, therefore, the word anthropology was limited to the

physical aspect only of man's nature. By another school of thinkers and writers the

tenn was employed to express, not the physical, but the moral and psychical aspects
                                                       "

of human nature, and by some divines it was used in a very special sense " to denote
that manner of expression by which the inspired "wi-iters attribute human parts and
passions to God " (Encyc. Biitannica). Gradually, therefore, the term has acquired
a wider and wider application, until in these days it has been made to embrace the
whole science of human nature.

   Both in this country and on the Continent societies have been established for the
cultivation of this science in its widest and most comprehensive signification, and
some of the results of their labom's have been given to the world in numerous pub-
lished memoirs on the anatomy, psychology, languages, arts, and customs of man-
kind, and on the distribution and characteristics of the various tribes or varieties of

men which inhabit or have inhabited our earth.

  We may now inquu'e what place would be occupied by a subject embracing so

--wide arange of topics as anthropologyin the progi-amme of a scientific body organized

on the basis of this Association of a body which, it must be remembered, was ori-

ginated, and had pursued a highly successful career, many years before men began

to think or speak of a science of anthropology in the sense in which the term is

now employed. And, without doubt, the first and most logical step was to pursue

the course which the General Committee took at the Birmingham Meeting in 1865,
to enlarge tlie scope of Section D, and by altering its title from Zoology and
Botany to Biology, to make it embrace the whole science of organization. An-
thropology, therefore, or the science of man, natm-ally came to be included within
this Section, and leave was given to the Committee of the Section to form a special
department for the consideration of anthropological papers, should memoirs suffi-
cient in number and importance be presented for perusal. So far, then, as the

associating of men together in one section can form a bond of union, all those who
work at the elucidation of the facts and laws of organization, whether they apper-
tain to the lowliest plant or animal, or to man himself, find in this Biological
 Section a common meeting-ground. And, I would venture to submit, it is right

 that it should be so. For the investigation of the physical aspects of man's nature,
 which necessarily forms so large a pai-t of our proceedings, demands the same
 precise method of work, and needs exactly the same training, as has to be gone

 through by all who aspire to excel either in this or in the other depai-tments of
 biology. If we look at the history of our subject, and, without referring to living
 men, recall the names of those who have contributed largely to its progi-ess

 Haller, Limiseus, Blumeubach, Cuvier, Johannes Miiller, William Lawrence, and
 John Goodsir at once stand out prominently, not only as accomplished anthro-

pologists, but as men well versed in a wide range of biological study. Those who

 are conversant with anthropological literature will, I doubt not, have little diffi-
 culty in calling to remembrance various writings in which errors, not only in the
 description of objects, but in the general conchisions anived at from their exam-
 ination, would have been avoided, if the previous training of the authors had been
 of a wider nature ; if they had fully appreciated the import of the processes of
 gTOwth and deA^elopment, nay, even the aben-ations from the normal state through

 pathological changes occurring dm'ing embryo, or adult life, to which man is sub-
 ject in common with other vei-tebrates.

    It is, I trust, needless for me to enlarge further on this topic, so that we may

 next proceed to inquire briefly into the part which an anthropological department

 may play in the proceedings of the British Association. \n societies devoted solely

 to the consideration of anthropological questions, and acting as independent bodies,

 such as the Anthropological Institute of London, or the corresponding Society in

 Paris, all the subjects included within and constituting the Science of man natu-

 rally fall within the scope of inquiry, and come under discussion as opportunity
 offers. But in this department of the Association we have not that complete in-
 dependence of action which these societies possess. AVe are only members of a
 still larger body, and the function which we perform must be duly subordinated
 to the common good ; and owing to our recent introduction into the programme
 of its proceedings, much of the ground which many would consider we were fairly

  entitled to cover, has been largely preoccupied by other and older depai-tments.
 As the physical aspects of oiu- subject are based on anatomy and physiology, many
 of the papers on the structure and function of the human body and its constituent

parts may doubtless be claimed by the Department of Anatomy, To other papers,
in which comparisons are instituted between human and animal structure, the Zoo-
logists may consider they have a title. To some extent also the habits of man

and numerous important questions of a social uatm'e are discussed in the Section

of Economic Science and Statistics. The time when man first appeared on the

face of the earth, the formations in which his remains and those of contemporary

animals are found, may come under the consideration of the Geologists. As our

subjects therefore dovetail so intimately with these other Sections of the Asso-

ciation, questions may occasionally arise whether papers submitted for perusal
come more appropriately within their province or within ours. Probably the most
satisfactoiy mode of solving this difficulty would be for the different Sections con-
cerned to come to a common understanding that all papers which treat of the ori-

gin, varieties, and progress of mankind should be forwarded to this department.
    Again, if a separate Ethnological Department or subsection were formed, as has

been suggested, or even if ethnological papers were read, as was for so many years
the case in the Geographical Section, not only would all these communications on

the characteristics of the different varieties of man, or their distribution over the

globe, but even papers on comparative philology, and on questions appertaining to

the early history of man, and to his primitive cultm'e, in all probability be subtracted

from our proceeding. Without doubt, all ethnic questions form an integral part of
anthropological study, for ethnology is one of those subjects which form the gTOimd-
work of our science ; and as it is an axiom that the whole is greater than and in-

cludes the part, all these questions naturally fall to be discussed in this department,

and shoidd not be divorced from their natural allies. The decision of the General

Committee that the ethnological papers should be ti-ansmitted to this department
was but to restore them to the place they originally occupied in the proceedings of
the Association, for in its early years ethnology was a subdivision of Section D.
The brief history of this department teaches us that its struggle for existence has

been a severe one. It was only after the dissociation of the ethnological papers
from the Geographical Section that our proceedings acquired much vitali^, and
to remove them from us now would be a severe blow to our usefulness.

   After recommending the Antiquarian Museum to the attention of visitors, Pro-

--fessor Turner concluded as follows : As the " noblest study of mankind is man,"

the subjects which come within the scope of our inquiries in this department are
amongst the most important in which a body of scientific men can be engaged.

Let us approach their consideration with a spirit of due humility and reverence

let our discussions be so regulated that our desire may be, not to attain merely a
personal victory in argument, but, if possible, to get at the ti'uth. And if we claim
to be called anthropologists, let not men say of us that our right to be so regarded

-- --is rather owing to our proficiencies, in the old Aristotelian meaning of the term, as

discussers of persons mere gossips than to our qualifications as patient and

humble students of the great science of human natm-e.

         On tlic Anthropology of the Merse. By John Beddod, M.D. ifc.

   The Merse is the low country of Berwickshire. Its ethnological history is pretty
nearly that of the county of Northumberland, with certain variations, which have
introduced a little more of the Gaelic and Scandinavian elements. The people are
stalwart and bulky in a remarkable deoree ; a number of the pure breed averaged
5 feet 11 J inches -^ith shoes, and 199 lbs. with clothes. Their heads are large and
well developed. The prevailing physical types may be referred to the Anglian and
Scandinavian. The hair and eyes are generally light. The fishermen of Eye-
mouth are a separate breed ; they also are very fair, and resemble Dutchmen or
Norwegians. Changes in the food of the peasantry (who are giving up oatmeal
and milk) and intermixture of blood, may have an unfavourable intiuence on the
physical development of the next generation.

         On Degeneration of Race hi Britain. By John Bebdoe, M.D.

   AVhile he allowed that iu some classes, and particularly in the upper classes ot
townspeople, the conditions of life were on the whole improving, and that the opera-
tion of the Factory Acts had checked the progress of physical degeneration among
manufacturing operatives, the author was of opinion that, on the whole, the agencies
tending to promote degeneration were more powerful than the counteiTailing ones.
Amono' them were the great increase of town population, the relative or even ab-
solute diminution of the inhabitants of rural districts, the increased demand for female

and youthful labom*, and for labour of a nocturnal or otherwise exhausting kind. He

did not think the food of the people improved proportionately vni\\ the rise of wages.
The disuse of milk among the poor of large towns and some dairy districts was a
great evil, and might have to do with the growing deterioration of teeth. England,
the richest and most advanced of the four British countries, had been shown by

Edward Smith to be the worst fed, so far as regarded the working classes.
   Dr. Beddoe's opinions were based in great measure on the results of certain

weighings and measurements executed by his correspondents in various parts of
the country, and he was anxious to add to the number of these correspondents, and
to obtain more data of a similar kind.

· On Le Sette Communi, a German Colony in the neighbourhood of Vicenza,
                                By Dr. Charnock, F.S.A.

   After referring to theories as to the origin of Le Sette Commimi, the author of
the paper showed that they settled in Italy temp. Theodoric, king of the Ostro-
goths. Tlie population amounts to 25,500. The people are principally engaged in
breeding cattle. At the present day quite two thirds of tliem would seem to be
neither of German nor of mixed origin, but are pure Italians, and speak Italian.

Even the rest of the people (many of whom have mtermarried with Italians) bear

a greater resemblance to the latter than to the Germans. Dr. Charnock never-

theless noticed many people with fair hair and German features. This was espe-
cially the case among the women. The people are simple in their manners, and
honest, but are poor, dirty, ignorant, and superstitious. No cases of goitre or
cretinism, and no peculiarity of dress were observed. The dialect resembles the

Oberdeutsch of the 15th century, and the language still spoken by the mountain-
dwellers of the Schlier and Tegern. The author made some remarks on the gram-
mar, and the paper concluded with a vocabularj' of some of the most important
words, and a specimen of the Lord's Pra3'er, which Dr. Charnock compared with
that of Le Tredici Communi.

    On the Physical, Mental, and Philological Characteristics of the Wallons.

                 By Dr. Charnoce, F.S.A., and Dr. Carter Blake.

    The ordinary Wallons stand in the same relation to Belgium as the Irish pea-
sants do to the " Sassenach " of England. They are usually jovial, good-natured,
generous, hospitable, chaste, poor, quarrelsome, and superstitious, like the Irish ; and
thus evince their Keltic descent. They are tough, rough, and hardy, and make
excellent soldiers. The Spanish armies in the Pays-Bas were made up of Wallons.
As evidence of their peculiar character, a Wallon will drag a pig from Namur to
Ghent, Bruges, or Antwerp, to gain a few sous more than he could in his own district.
The character of the people differs somewhat in each district. Those of Liege are
very lively, spiritual, and laborious ; those of Namur proud and coarse. The Wal-

lons of Lower Pomerania stand even lower than those of Namur. Among the
Wallons of Liege, even the women are renowned for their strength, industry, and

energy. Like the men, they do the hardest Irind of worlc, as coal-drawing, and
towing the Mouse boats ; and the Germans style Liege " HoUe der Frauen." Tlie
Wallon dialect is rich in metaphors, witty in expression, boldly figurative, and full

of onomatopoeias. Generally speaking, it may be said that the Wallon is a spo-
ken, not a written language. The pronunciation differs in different localities ; and
such are the modifications of accentuation, that almost everj^ village has its own

   The author stated that the stone, of which a rough di-awing of the natiu-al size
was exhibited, lies in a field near the river BojTie, belonging- to J. Youell, Esq.

The stone is a Hock of Old Red Sandstone, 2 ft. 11 in. X 2 ft. 10 in. X 1 ft. 8 in. It

is known in the neighboiu'hood by the name of "the Giant's finger-stone." It is
now 115 yards from a circular earthen encampment, which the author described.

   There are characters on all of its surfaces which the author believes to be cut,
and not punched. The author is not able to give any intei-pretation of these

markings.

                   On the Orir/in of tJie Domestic Animals of Europe,

                    By W. Boyd Dawkins, M.A., F.B.8., F.G.S.

   None of them date so far back as the Quatemaiy age. The sheep, goat, small-
horned ox {Bos longifrons), the domestic horse, the dog, the tamed wild boar, and
the turf-hog, to which all the European swine can be traced, appeared in Europe

at the same time in the Neolithic age. He argued that they were probably derived

from the East, and imported by a pastoral people from the central plateau of Asia,
The evidence afibrded on the point by the southern forms of vegetation foimd along
with this gToup of animals in the S'niss lakes adds considerable weight to this view.
In Britain, down to the time of the English invasion, there was no evidence of any
larger breed of oxen than the small short-horned Bos longifrons ; the larger breed of
the TJrus type were probably imported by the English, and is represented in the
present day in its purity by the white -bodied, red-eared Chillingham ox. In the

course of the discussion Dr. Sclater fully agi'eed with the views of the speaker as

to the eastern origin of our domestic animals, since the East is the only region in.

which the wild ancestors of the domestic breeds are now found.

      On the attempted Classification of the Pcdaolithic Age hy means of the

           Mammalia. By W. Botd Dawkins, M.A., F.B.S., F.G.S.

   The late eminent French naturalist, M. Lartet, acting on an « ^^'''i'^'^ considera-
tion, has attempted to divide up the Palaeolithic age into four distinct periods.
" L'age du gxand ours des caverues, I'age de IMlephant et du rhinoceros. Page du
renne, et l'age de I'aurochs." The very simphcity of this system has made it
popular. There are, however, two fatal objections to this mode of classification.
In the first place, nobody could expect to find the whole Quaternary fauna buried
in one spot. One animal could not fail to be better represented in one locality than
another, and therefore the contents of the cave- and river-deposits must always
have been difierent. The den of a hytena coidd hardly be expected to afford pre-
cisely the same animals as a cave which had been filled with bones by the action
of water. It therefore follows that the very diversity which M. Lartet insists upon
as representing different periods of time, must necessarily have been the result of
different animals occupying the same area at the same time. In the second place,
M. Lartet has not advanced a shadow of proof as to which of these animals was
the first to arrive in Europe. From the fact that the glacial period was colder
than the quaternary, it is probable that the arctic mammalia, the mammoth, woolly
rhinoceros, and the reindeer arrived here before the advent of the cave-bear. It is
undoubtedly true that they died out one by one, and it is veiy probable that they also
came in gradually. The fossil remains from the English caves and river-deposits,
as, for instance, those of Kent's Hole or Bedford, prove only that the animals in-
habited Britain at the same time, and do not in the least degree warrant any specu-
lation as to which animal came here first. Nor does it apply to France or Belgium,

On the Relative Ages of the Flint- and Stone-Imphment Periods in Enrjland.

                                       £;/ J. ^S: Flower, F.G.S.

   In this paper, the author, after pointing out the great importance of the subject

in relation to anthropology, stated that he proposed to show that, having regard
to the result of recent researches and observations, the arrangement hitherto usually
adopted of dividing the stone age into two epochs or periods only (Palseolithic
and Neolithic) was insufficient, as regards England, and that for the purpose of
scientific investigation, that which has been called the Palreolithic, might pro-
perly be subdivided into at least three distinct periods. That upon geological
gi'ounds, the Drift-implement period must be regarded as remote by a vast in-
terval from the Bone-cave period, with which it has been classed by Sir Charles
Lyell and Sir John Lubbock, inasmuch as the gi-avels and sands which now
overlie the implement-bearing gravels must certainly have been deposited after
the implements were fonned, and the production of such considerable masses of
detritus can only have been the work of very extended periods of time, which had
been conjectured as embracing even 100,000 years. That since these implements
were made, it was obvious that most important geological changes had occurred,
and in particular, that during this interval England hadoeen severed from the con-
tinent of Em-ope, as the Isle of Wight had been separated from England. That in
Eno-land and in France the gravel in, or under which the implements were found,
as well as the animal remains found with them, were of precisely the same origin
and mineral character, and in both countries resting immediately upon the Chalk
and as further evidence that the implements were made before the separation;
and that thus the two countries were then inhabited, may be noticed the fact, that
both in the valley of the Sonime, and in that of the Little Oiise in Norfolk, the
implement-bearing beds are overlain by thick deposits of peat, containing precisely
the same vegetable and animal remains, which in both countries are quite di-

--stinct from those of the Drift, and of a far later date amongst others, the Beaver,

Bos hngifrons, Eoe, Wild Boar, and Bed Deer.
    As further evidence of the extreme antiquity of these objects, Mr. Flower also

drew attention to the circumstance, that hitherto no implement of the tnie di'ift-
type had been found north-west of a line drawn from the estuaiy of the Severn
to that of the Wash, between Norfolk and Lincolnshire, following the Lias escarp-

 ment, and only a little northward of the limit of the Boulder-clay deposit ; and he
 suggested it as by no means impossible, that when these implements were made,

 the north of England, and perhaps all Scotland and Wales, were still submerged
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

 and that although the implements were certainly found in Bedfordshire and NorfoUc
 lying on Boulder-clay, those districts, not improbably, were elevated, and perhaps

 inhabited very long before the lands now lying to the north-west became habitable.

    The author considered it extremely improbable that either the drift implements

 or the gravels in or imder which they are foimd, if transported by river-action,

 should have been deposited, as had been commonly supposed, by rivei-s which
then ran in the same direction, and drained the same areas as now ; inasmuch as

 they have lately been found at such elevations, and in such situations, as to preclude

 the belief that at any period since the surface assumed its present contours, any

 existing rivers could have eft'ected the ti'ansport ; and in support of this view several

 recent discoveries were referred to.

   He fm-ther observed that it seemed by no means certain, as was generally

 believed, that the makers of the flint implements were contemporary with the

 elephants and other animals, with whose remains they were often found asso-
                                                                                                      ;

poraneity, at least not in deposits of this character. The animal remains were

undoubtedly transported from some distance, together with the gravel in which

they are now found, whereas, from various indications which the author specified,

it seemed e\ddent that the implements were manufactured from stone taken /ro?ft

tJiat gravel, and at that time lying exposed upon the sm'face.

In order to show that the implements of the Drift were of far greater variety in

form and use, and much better workmanship than those of later times, Mr. Flower

exhibited a large series, showing sixteen or eighteen distinct forms ; and as evi-

dencing the palffiontological distinction between the Drift- and the Cave-periods,

he stated that while the former contained, so far as at present known with cer-

tainty, only six genera and seven species, the latter exhibited fourteen additional

species, comprising the important forms of Hysena, Wolf, Lion, Badger, Elk, and

Hare, and thus exhibiting (with one somewhat doubtful exception, that of the

Cave-bear) the first appearance of Carnivora amongst the postglacial mammals.

INIr. Flower then adverted to the entire absence from the Drift of any works of

art other than the implements, whilst the Caves presented numerous forms of

weapons and tools in bone as well as in stone and niut, only one of which could

be said to agi'ee with a Drift form ; and he added that the Tumulus- or Barrow-

period, which he considered was the next distinct Stone-period in order of time

in England, was separated from that of the Caves by an interval of vast duration,

as indicated by the entire disappearance of the Carnivora and Pachj'dermata found

in the caves, and the introduction, by creation (or as some might say by evolu-

tion), of a Fauna almost entirely new, comprising almost all our domestic animals,

and in addition the use of bronze, jet, and amber, and other objects indicative of

a gi-eat advance in civilization.

In conclusion the author expressed his opinion that inasmuch as bronze was

certainly in use at the same time with the stone implements of both the Palaeo-

lithic and Neolithic types, as evidenced by its presence as well in Celtic tumuli as

in the megalithic monuments of presumably later date, it could not properly be

regarded as posterior to either of them, or as representing any distinct epoch;

and as regarded the Stone-period, he suggested that what had been known as

the Palajolithic might properly be classified under three heads, viz. Palceolithic,

to be confined to implements and tools of the Drift ; Archaic for the Bone-cave

objects, and those of like date found on the surface, while the term Prehistoric

might be used to designate the rude stone flakes and knives &c. found in the

barrows ; the term Neolithic might be applied to all the polished or ground stone

implements, while the term Bronze might be regarded as common to both that and

the Archaic period, rather than as representing any distinct era.

       On Centenarian Lonf/evit(/. By Sir Duncan Gibb., Burt., M.D.

   His observations had reference to the physical condition of centenarians, which

helped to show how they were enabled to reach such a great age. They were

derived ti'om a comparison of fom- genuine examples he had himself seen. These
he hoped to raise to six in a few days by a visit to two others near Edinburgh. Of
the four, two were males, each 103 years of age, and two females, aged 101 and
102 ; the last of the fom- was still alive. Regarding their age there was no doubt
for he had been as careful on that point as any believer in the questionable asser-
tion of Sir George Cornewall Lewis that no one ever reached a himdred years.
Tlie author found in all four the functions of breathing and circulation performed
with the most complete and perfect integrity, there being an absence even of those
changes usually seen as the result of ordinary old age. The chest was well formed
and of fairly good capacity ; the cartilages of the ribs were not ossified ; the voice

--was good, clear, sonorous, and powerful, though a little cracked and tremulous in

two its power depending upon the capacity of the chest and integrity of the
lungs. The heart (the great organ of the circulation) was quite healthy, and free

--from the chief sources of trouble in old persons namely, fat or its compounds.

This circumstance, although it did not pi'event moderate calcification of the blood-

vessels, yet was a conserTator of all the tissues of the hody, and especially pre-

vented the occuiTence of those changes which tend to shorten life. There was an ab-

sence of the atheromatous changes commonly observed in old people. This explained

the appearance of the coimtenance in all, and imparted a sort of silver)/ expression,

with apparently great toughness of the skin, which the author deemed an essential

peculiarity in persons over ninety. All the sjjecial senses were unimpaired except

hearing. The eye was clear in all, the sight excellent, all could read ordinaiy type

without spectacles ; there was no arc or ring roimd the clear part of the eye, as

observed in most old people. The sense of smell was good ; none smoked, used

snulF, nor chewed tobacco.  The hearing was somewhat impaired in three                                                                                                                                                                              in one
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

of the males it was so acute that he could hear the slightest soimd. The mental

faculties were active in all, the memory good. The general health was capital in

all, appetite and digestion good, the latter, indeed, imcotnmonly strong ; all pos-

sessed the good, sound teeth they had masticated with when yovmg. From this it

was readily understood their digestive powers were capital. Taking, then, the

. condition of mind and body presented by the four undoubted centenarians, it may

be said that in all there was an absence of those changes usually observed in per-

sons approaching the allotted period of threescore and ten. These changes have

reference chiefly to the condition of the blood-vessels and other tissues which are

so seldom found absent. Suffice it to say that complete composure of mind

throughout life has had much to do with the condition of body permitting the

attainment of such great longevity ; there was no hereditary condition also to

interfere with nature's laws vuider such circumstances. Climate does not seem to

interfere with longevity, for centenarians are said to be numerous in Russia. To

reach that age not only must the constitution be natm-ally a good and he.althy

one, but all the gTeat functions of Hfe must be performed without any impediment.

If the special senses are coordinately good, they assist in keeping up the condi-

tion favourable to longevity. But there is one change antagonistic to extreme

--longevity, and it is the most important one namely, the predominance of the

atheromatous element which leads to those changes, in the blood-vessels especially,

which close life at the natural period. Simplicity of regimen and avoidance of

those elements of food which in their assimilation help to bring on those changes

may ward it ofl' altogether, although the author was not able to make out whether

the four centenarians ho spoke of had been in any way particular on this point.

In conclusion, he said he believed all centenarians were tired of life, however

extraordinary it might appear, and were thankful when it pleased God to remove

them from this world.

              A Note on tlie Fat Woman exJiibiting in London.

                               Bi/ Sir Dt7>-cax Gibb, Bart., M.D.

   As a rule, he said, enormously fat women were rare compared with men.
Caroline Heenan, now exhibiting in London, is twenty-two years old, and weighs

40 stone, or 5G0 lbs. ; she is 7 feet round the body, 3 feet inches across tlie
shoulders, and 26 inches round the ann. Differing from most fat people, though
the limbs are very large, they are not exclusively composed of fat, a large pro-
portion being due to muscular development, which is confirmed by her history
and actual inspection. The chest and abdomen are of course enormous, but not
from simple obesity. Her growth and enlargement have been progi-essive from
infancy, and withal she has been able to sustain gi-eat muscular exercise that
would have fatigued ordinary persons, which is opposed to the view of pure
adipose enlargement. At nine months she weighed 70 lbs., at nine years she was
11 stone, and at fourteen years 24 stone. She is handsome and pleasing, ftice not

fat nor greasy, is highly intelligent, and not in any way drowsy. She will in all
probability progi-essively increase as she gets older, and may become the largest
and heaviest female who has yet been seen.

On the Anthropology of Auguste Comie. By J. Kaines, M.A.I. 4'c.

The sources of this paper are to be found in the chapters on " Biology " and

"Fetichisui" of INI. Comte's ' Philosophie Positive' and in the tliird chapter of the

'Politique Positive.' The paper itself aimed to show that the differences between

man and the rest of the animal iiiugdoni were not so great as they are usually

represented                                                nor, in fact, were they so numerous as  their resemblances.                  Treating
                                                        ;

man as the head of the zoological series, it argued that his dominion over animals

was from primitive times, and is now a moral dominion rather than intellectual.

--Man, he went on to saj^, was the first of animals not the last of angels. Zoology

knew nothing of angels. "What differences existed between man and animals were

of degree rather than quality.                             Both knew want, suffering, and          sorrow                               both  had

intellect and moral sense ; both were educable by love, both had their likes and

dislikes, both had to struggle for existence, both were interested by the same

sights. What was new, struck both and perplexed both alike. Both exhibited

faithfulness, reverence, love, pity, and remorse. There was not wanting evidence

that both passed through the same intellectual and moral developments. Seeing,

then, that the animals had so much in common, what had led man to separate himself

--from the animals, to exalt himself above them ? the possession of reason, while

the animals had instinct only, some persons might say. But a little reflection

would show that man was almost as much a creature of instinct as the other animals.

A soimd biological philosophy made no difference between man and the other ani-

mals; on the contraiy, it sought to trace his genesis from inferior organisms.

Several species of animals had undoubtedly the speculative faculty, which led to

a kind of fetichism. The difference was that man had raised himself out of this

limited darkness, which the brutes had not yet, except a few select animals in

which a beginning to polytheism might be observed, obtained, no doubt, by asso-

ciation with man. If, for instance, we exhibited a watch to a child or a savage

on the one hand, and to a dog and a monkey on the other, there would be no great
difference in their way of regarding the new object further than their form of

expression. The author went on to complain that hitherto psychology had limited

itself to the study of man alone, and even his nature had been regarded only from

its intellectual side. The psychology of animals had yet to be studied, and that

with a desire only to arrive at truth. In concluding, the author lurged that it

was only in so far as all external nature was used by man for moral ends that it

was rightly used, and that the intellect found its true work in directing his affective

nature to moral purposes and relations.

                                                           The Lapps. By Dr. R. King.

The Laplander offers himself for our inspection as the only European who in

any way represents the Circumpolar tribes. The exact position of the Lapps in

classification is still an open question. Professor Agassiz classifies them with the

Esquimaux and Samoiedes. Dr. Prichard, relying upon philological evidence (a

very unsafe guide when taken alone), maintains that the Lapps are Finns who have

acquired Mongolian features from a long residence in Northern Europe, but ac-

cording to Arthur de Capel Brookes, who passed a winter amongst them, the Lap-

lander and Finn have scarcely a single trait in common. The general physiog-

nomy of the one is totally unlike that of the other; and no one who has ever seen
Athe two could mistake a Finlander for a Laplander.
                                                                                                   critical examination of

three Laplander crania and two casts, contained in the collection of Dr. Morton,

and a comparison of these with a number of Finnic skulls, convince the author

that the Laplander cranium should he regarded as a subtj-pical form, occupying

the transitionary place between the pyramidal type of the true hyperboreana on

the one hand, and the globidar-headed and square-faced Mongol on the other.

The Laplander is certainly of low stature, but he is not a pigmy, as he has been

represented. The stature of the Esquimaux averages 5 feet 7 inches. In En-

gland the average for the men is 5 feet 6 inches, and in Patagonia 6 feet 2 inches

but we have no real measurement of the Lapps. The Laplander is veiy lean in

Aflesh, and has not the fat and bulli: of the Esqiumaux.  thick head, prominent

forehead, hollow and blear eyes, shoi-t flat nose and wide mouth, characterize the

Laplander. The hair is thin, short, and shaggy ; the beard straggling, and

scarcely covering the chin, in which respect he assimilates with the Esquimaux.

The hair of both sexes is black and harsh, the chest broad, and the waist slender.

He is swift of foot and very strong ; so that a bow which a Norwegian can

scarcely half bend he will draw to the fidl, the arrow reaching to the head.

Rimning races, climbing inaccessible rocks and high trees is the usual exercise.

Though nimble and strong, he never walks quite upright, but always stooping, a

habit obtained by frequently sitting in his hut on the ground. The Laplander was

originally Pagan, full of superstition, and believing in magic and omens, and

worshipping their chief deity .f umala in a kind of temple in thick remote woods

not built with walls and roof, but only a piece of ground fenced as were the old

--Roman temples, until the planting of Christianity in the time of Ladulaus Magnus

in the year 1277 a Christianity diflering, however, from Paganism only in name,

imtil the founding of a school by Gustavus Adolphus in 1631, to which the Lap-

landers owe their progress in the knowledge and love of the Christian religion,

wliich appears from the many useful and eminent persons bred there. The author

described at length their maniage ceremonies. They may be called a moral race.

Polygamy and divorce are uulmown. It is unlawful to marry too near in blood.

The author stated that then- families are small, rarely exceeding three. The

author then described their mode of bringing up young children from their earliest

years. Wexionius is of opinion that the Swedes gave the " Lapp " their name

from their wearing skins, but lapper and skin-lapper do not properly signify skins.

Nieuren derives their name from their coming into Swedelaud every year with

rags lapt about them, which is the signification of Lapp in Greek.

According to some authors, the inhabitants do not denominate the country, but

the countiy the inhabitants, as in the name Norwegian and others, strengthened

by Olaus Magnus, who calls them Lappomanni, Westmanui, and Sudermauni, iu

which words nianni signifying men, they were called Lappomanni, i.e. Men of Lappia.

Others say that the name of the country is derived from Lappu, which in the

Finnonick language is Fm'thermost, because it lies in the farthest part of Scandi-

navia. On this point Lehi-berg agrees. Ibre derives it from Lop or Lapp, an

old Swedish word for wizard or enchanter.

The domestication of the Reindeer and the use of a drum, which is elaborately

engraved with birds, animals, and celestial bodies, and is practised incessantly for

the piu'pose of foretelling events, characterize this people from most of the circum-

polar family.

                 0)1 MegalitJiic Circles. Btj Lieut.-Col. Forbes Leslie.

    This paper is intended in refutation of the theory that all megalithic cii-cles

were primarily and exclusively sepulchral ; and, on the contrary, to show that the
great circular monuments were erected or occupied for religious ceremonies by
successive generations of the early races of Britain. Although it is not improbable
that these ceremonies were connected with the funeral rites of the dead, whose
barrows or cairns, sometimes surrounded by " standing stones," were raised around
or within sight of the fane by which they were attracted.

   The description of the great methalithie circles of England and Aberdeenshire,
were illustrated by diagrams to show the peculiarities of construction which dis-
tinguish monuments designed for religious ceremonies from " standing stones "
which defined or dignified a place of sepulture.

   In proof that the same sites were occupied, and the same megalithic masses

were used by successive races or generations, it was shown, from the position of
certaui hieroglyphic figures of an ancient type on some members of the circles in
Aberdeenshire, that they must have been overthrown, and reerected in their present

form of megalithic circles.

   The argmnents in favour of the religious obj ect in the gi-eat megalithic circles
were included imder the following seven heads :

   I. They were not places of sepulture, but fanes, temples for heathen worship
for no sepulchral deposits which could rationally be connected with the origin of
these monvmients, had been found within these circles.

   II. Not being sepulchral, a religious object may be inferred from the position of

the principal group of monoliths being relative to a particular point of the

compass.

  AIII. pecidiai- type of sculptm-es, which are not sepulchral, found on members of

these circles.

   IV. The vast size of some of the circles and of the masses of stone of which they

are formed.

    V. Having stone avenues, causeways, or other permanent approaches.
    VI. Being selected as places for worship by early Christians ; and being often
called churches, both in Gaelic and in the lowland Scotch dialect, although no
Christian church ever occupied their sites.
    VII. In India, stone circles and other megalithic monuments were anciently, and
71010 are commonly erected as places of worship. This was emphatically asserted,
on personal observation and the best authority, not as a doubtful argument, but as
an undeniable fact, and that the practice existed not in one only, but in many
districts, some of which were mentioned, as well as the authorities.

     On Ancient Hlerorjhjphic Sculptures. By Lieut.-Col. Forbes Lesme.

   In this paper it is maintained that the hieroglyphics found graven on earth-fast
rocks, boulders, and rude monoliths in Scotland, are symbols of religious ideas

the argument being confined to such ligm-es as are graven in mde monoliths where

no Christian symbol appears.
   These hieroglj^hics are referred to two distinct types, the most ancient of

which appear to have been the works of a race that was superseded by the Celtic,

to whom the later type of sculptures may confidently be assigned.

   The ancient typo is found iu many parts of England and Ireland as well as in
Scotland, which would lead to the conclusion that a homogeneous people occupied

the three countries. This type of figures is found profusely scattered on rocks
where sepulture was impossible, and no connexion with any sepulchral remains has
been traced.

   The second type of sculptures, although certainly of heathen origin, is evidently
of a later age. Many of them have been discovered, none, however, beyond the
limits of those districts of Scotland which were occupied by the Celtic tribe of

Picts.

    In this paper the author, whilst maintaining the religious origin of the figures
graven on rude monoliths, combats the theory which would assign their origin to
a species of Pictish heraldry, and their use to have been as personal ornaments.

of 100 feet above tliat sea, the rocks themselves attaining an elevation of 2G0 feet.

They have now been repeatedly rifled by the learned or the curious ; but when the

principal cave was nearly intact, the author made a section of it from the modern

or highest floor down to the solid rock. There were five floors formed in the earth

by long  continued  trampling                                          on  each, and  near the  centre,  were marks of fire,
                                                                    ;

around which broken bones and flints were abundant, except upon the lowest,

where but few bones occurred and no flints. The bones were those of animals still

existing. Few implements were found, but many chips of flint, some cores, and

stones used as haumiers. Perhaps this cave was used as a place for manufacturing

flints, which must have been carried from their native bed, distant about one mile.

There is nothing to evince the action of Avater ; on the contrary, the numerous

stones that occur are all angular, derived apparently from the flaking ofl" of portions

--of the rock, a slow process, and showing that long periods had elapsed between

each of those five occupations, and thus evidencing the great antiquity of the

present European fauna.

Whatever that antiquity may have been, we now come to still more ancient

times.

   Below these caves a slope of about 180 feet descends to the edge of the sea.
Through the upper part of this slope, at distances from the caves of from to 10
feet, is a railway-cutting 600 feet long, 54 feet deep, and GO feet above the sea.
The mass removed in making this cutting was composed of angular stones, not
waterwom. Loose at the surface, it soon became a more or less mature breccia
(specimens were produced), for the most part so hard that it was blasted with gun-
powder. In this breccia, and at various depths, some of more than 30 feet, the
author has taken out teeth of the Bear (Ursits spelceus) and of the Hyfena (Hi/ccna

sjK-laa), while with and below those teeth he found flints worked by man (spe-

cimens of teeth and of flints were produced).
   Bones and teeth of other animals also occur, for the naming of which the author

is indebted to tlie kindness of Mr. Busk, who says that they are almost identical

with those found in the Gibraltar caves.

   At the eastern end of the cutting described the railroad passes through a tunnel,
emerging close to the sea, and near to what is known as the Roman bridge. Hero

in sinking for the foundation of a sea-wall, bones and teeth were discovered, but

not tuider such satisfactory conditions as at the western side of the tunnel, since

the stones were loose and some of them rounded.

   Still following the line of the railway to the east, at half a mile a deep cutting

occurs through stifl" clay, the result of the washing down of the hill-side. In this,
at a depth of 65 feet, the author took out the frontal bone and part of the antlers
of a large stag (produced). They were perfect; but in such a state that he could

save only the parts.

  A few feet oft", and on the same horizon, were these teeth of Ursvs spckais,

marvellously well preserved A\-hen we consider the time that must have been re-

quired for the accumulation of 65 feet of solid ground ; and that not in a hollow or

a river's bed, but on the gently sloping side of a hill.

   The author suggested that the section of the cave evidences the great antiquity
of the present European fauna, vrhile the teeth of the CaA-e Bear and Hyrcna found

with Avorked flints some .30 feet deep in solid breccia, add to the proofs hitherto

adduced that those beasts were really contemporary with man.

     On Ancient Modes of Sejndtitre in iJie Orlncys. By Geoege Petrie.

   The author stated that sepulchral nioimds are A'ery numerous in the Orkneys.
Generally they occupy elevated situations which command a view of the sea, or of
a lake, or of both, Avhere the latter was attainable. They stand singly or in groups,

or aie arranged in a straight line. Occasionally they appear as twin barrows.

They differ greatly in size, and there is also much diversity in their internal ar-

rangements. In some of the barrows (which, with rare exceptions, are of the bowl-

shape) human skeletons have been found in kists, either lying extended at full

length, or on the right or left side in a flexed posture : in one ease the skeleton

was in a sitting posture. It is not uncommon to find interments both by inhuma-

tion and cremation in the same barrow, and even in the same kist.

Graves or kists unconnected with barrows are not imfrequently met with, but

they are only accidentally discovered. If baiTows formerly existed over any of

them, they have long since disappeared.

Some of the largest barrows contained only a small quantity of fragments of

burnt bones, or ashes lying about the centre of the barrow, either on a fiat stone,

or imbedded in a greasy-looking clay. In others the burnt l^ones and ashes lay on

the natm-al surface of the soil beneath a small cairn of stones, over which clay had
Abeen heaped to complete the mound.
                                         third class contained one or more kists,

usually of flagstone set on edge, either wholly undressed, or more or less rudely

fitted together. The kists, which average about 2| feet in length and 1| foot in

width and depth, are found to contain either burnt bones or ashes, or cinerary urns

of stone or fire-baked clay, in which the bones or ashes have been deposited. Few

stone or bronze weapons are found in the barrows or kists, and personal ornaments

are still more rarely met with. The urns are usually very rude.

  Two human skeletons were found near Erkwall in a stone kist underneath a

barrow ; both were in the flexed postui-e. One was on its right side with its head

close to one end of the kist, and the other lay on its left side at the opposite end.

The skuU of the first-mentioned skeleton has been described by Dr. J. Barnard

Da\-is as presenting all the characteristic features of the Ancient Briton ; the other

skidl was of a greatly inferior type, more square in outline and remarkably thick.

A large kist was discovered in another locality in Orkney, also containing two

human skeletons lying similarly to those already described, and presenting the

Same characteristic difierences. In each case the skeleton of lowest tj^e appeared

to have been rudely treated and recklessly thrust into the kist, while great care

had evidently been taken with the other skeleton found beside it. The whole ap-

pearance of the skeletons and their arrangement in the kists suggested the question,

Were the squat skeletons with the short thick skulls those of slaves or captives
who had been slain and placed beside their masters ? and have wo in them dis-

covered traces of an aljoriginal race of colonists of the Orkneys, akin to the Fins

or Esquimaux, whose snow houses the so-called Picts'-houses so closely resemble in

form and structure, making due allowance for the difference between the materials

employed in their construction ?

There is another class of tumuli in Orlmey known as "Picts'-houses." They

usually resemble the Bowl-barrows externally, but when examined the so-called

" Pict's-house " is found to be a mass of building, generally circular at the base,

containing in its centre several small chambers or cells surrounding a lai-ger cham-

ber. Each cell is connected by a low short passage with the central chamber, and

from the latter a passage extends to the outside of the structure, which is circum-

scribed by a low wall or facing, generally about 2 feet in height. The walls of

each chamber converge till at the top or roof they are only a foot or two apart,

and the opening is covered in by flagstoues placed across it. Occasionally human

skeletons Iiave been found in such buildings ; but most archoBologists were of opi-

nion that the Picts'-houses were not sepulchral. The opening of Maes-how in

Stenness, and especially of a chambered mound in its neighboui'hood, showed, how-
Aever that they had been used as tombs, as Mr. Petrie had supposed.
                                                                     subsequent

discovery of a " Pict's-house " within the ruins of a " Brough," or Round Tower,

containing human skeletons along with bones of the Ox, Sheep, &c., and two rude

stone implements of peculiar form, afforded still more conclusive evidence of the
sepulchral character of the " Picts'-houses," and proved beyond a doubt that, even if

originally erected as dwellings, they had subsequently been used as chambered tombs.

It would be premature at present, Mr. Petrie observed, to attempt to determine the

age of the "Picts'-houses," but the "Broughs," with which they appear to be in-

timately connected, were imdoubtedly existing merely as ruined buildings, and in

many instances presenting externally only the appearance of huge barrows, when

tlie Norsemen invaded the islands in the ninth century. The last class received from
the Norsemen the name of "Hoi," or gravemouud (now called "Howe"), and
the former, in which the structures were still visible, were known as "Bjorgs"
(" Broughs "). So far as has yet been ascertained, the discovery of iron implements
has been limited to the ruins known as "Broughs," which appear to have been
known to, and in some cases occupied by, the Norsemen. The moimds which bear
the name of " Howe," and have, when opened, been found to conceal the remains
of "Broughs," have yielded only stone, bone, and a few bronze relics. Mr. Petrio

referred to one of those moimds near Kirkwall, in which he lately found Roman

silver coins of the Emperors Vespasian, Hadrian, and Antoninus Pius.
   Details were given of various barrows and kists and of their contents, and the

descriptions were illustrated by diagi-ams.

On an Expedition for tlie Special Investigation of tlie Hebrides and West

   Highlands, in search of Evidences of Ancient Serpent-Worship. By

   John S. Phen^:, F.O.S., F.B.G.S., Memher of the British Archceological

    Association.

   The author commenced by stating that he felt bound to give the grounds for his
assertion, made at the last Meeting of the British Association at Liverpool, that
he had met with evidences of sei-pent-mounds and constiaictions identical with
those of Ohio and Wisconsin.

   Impressed with the idea that if serpent-worship had been a feature in the early
religion of these lands some evidences must still remain, he organized a party for
searching such localities in the Hebrides and West Highlands as had not been ex-
amined with that object, nor had come under the attention of the theorists for
serpent-worship, such as Dr. Stukeley and Sir R. C. Hoare ; the party wasimbiassed,
and former theories strictly avoided. It became purely a matter of survey of exist-
ing relics that was undertaken.

   The paper was very fully illustrated by diagrams, and the author first drew at-
tention to one representing three outlines of animal forms, two being earthen
moimds, taken from the elaborate surveys in Wisconsin by J. A. Lapham, Esq.,
and the third the stone foimdation of a " bo'li " in South Uist, in a work by Capt.

F. L. W. Thomas, R.N. Thou^gh the purposes and materials were different, the

designs clearly demonstrated the fact that the early inhabitants of Britain and

America made constructions in the forms of animals. From this he proceeded to
the earliest pottery, and by his diagrams showed the great similarity between that
of the earliest British and American, from a sepulchral urn in the Ashmolean
Museum, Oxford, and one taken from a movmd at Racine, on Lake Michigan, by
Dr. P. R. Hoy, with a similar specimen obtained from Berigonium, and which was

on the table. Instances also of cremative burial, and of whole skeletons in the
sitting posture, in both countries, clearly indicated a unity of custom. Having,
he thought, established these points, he proceeded to trace the com-se of serpent-

worship from the east; he related some of his own experiences of that worship in
India, followed it through Egypt to Greece, pointing out that some of the myths
covered its struggles with the more intellectual religion of that country, as the" de-
struction of the Python by Apollo, the strangling of serpents by Hercules, and the
relapse of Laocoon and his two sons into the gTOsser rites, and their consequent
Eunishment. Having traced the spread of this worship and its course westward,

  e next drew special attention to the construcrion of earthen mounds and tumuli
in America and Britain : he quoted from Messrs. Lapham and Squier's surveys,
that natural mounds were adapted artificially to peculiar pui-poses ; at Lapham's
Peak three artificial momids were found, of stone and eartli, on the lofty summit
 the material had been conveyed by gi-eat labour ; the hill on which the " Great
 Serpent Mound " of Mr. Squier is placed had been " cut out, evidently to adapt it
 to the form desired to be constructed.'" In the ' Annals of Cambridge ' a tumulus
 in the Gogmagog Hills was fomied by layers of different soils, each totally unlike
 the soil of the neighbourhood, and brought by great labour fi-om remote distances.
 The Castle Hill at Cambridge is a British tumulus raised on a preexisting natural

elevation. The Eildon Hills have similar artificial adaptations ; and tlie author
had himself traced the ditlerent soils of the tumulus in the greater Cumbrae, and

the hollows whence they were brought. He referred to the artificial summit of

the Dragon Hill, at Uffington Castle, Berks, and suggested that the White Horse
and the sculptured rocks at Ilkley were British delineations. After these e-\-idence3
of adaptation, he described the sei-pent, lizard, and alligator mounds of Messrs.
Squier and Lapham, which contain oval works towards the head, and evidences of

altars and fire within them. He then showed by diagi'ams several mounds that he

identified as corresponding with these, some even in minute details ; he referred to
examples in Arran, in Monteviot Park, in which latter, towards the south and east
of what he considered the site of an altar, he discovered human remains, and finally
dwelt on a serpentine mound in Argyleshire several hundi-ed feet long, and about
15 feet high by 30 broad, tapering gradually to the tail, the head being formed by
a circular cairn, the centre of which had evidently been occupied by a megalithic
structure, which he considered an altar, the large stones of which were lying

round the base of the cairn. He could not of course adduce direct evidences of the

worship of the serpent, but it had been traced as coexistent with sim-worship in
America, where these evidences of the serpent were found ; and discovering similar
rem.ains in Britain, which retains many indications of sim-worship, and as these
two forms of worship went almost hand in hand in other countries, he considered
himself justified in concluding that he had found examples of it here also, di-awing

attention to the variety and beauty of the specimens of early British art on the
table to show the care and extent of his explorations.

On some indications of tJie Manners and Customs of tlie carhj Inliahitants of

  Britain, deduced from the Remains of their toivns and villages. By John

   S. PnExi, F.G.S., F.R.G.S., Member of the British Archaological Asso-

    ciation.

the circle, curve, or oval in all the earliest British remains ; and the similarity of

Hethe physics of the various localities where British towns are still ti-aceable.

selected the -widely separated positions of Greaves Ash, in the Cheviot Hills, Stand-

lake, near Oxford, and Tolsford Hill, near Saltwood Castle, Kent ; and after showing

that the same features existed in each of these, although some of the settlements

were formed by excavations  and  some by erections                                                                      after  referring  for  examples

-- --amulets, articles of domestic use, as the quern, and to the cup- and ring-marks
on the incised stones of Northumberland, New Grange, Ilkley, and elsewhere, he

argued that though divided into clans and tribes, yet that these were originally

but divisions of one people, as the idea could not be entertained that at the time

of these formations, with manj- of the tribes separating the people of such remote

districts, to say nothing of their frequent hostility, diflerent races should have

assimilated so much, more especially with inten-upted, or indeed no direct com-

munications. He did not, however, mean that this prejudiced the question of

cooccupation by a foreign and immigrating, or even preoccupying race, at that time

being distinct and unamalgamated with the mass of the people. Assuming these

evidences conclusive, he proceeded to compare the constructions with others at a

still wider range, selecting in Britain the extreme points of the Hebrides, Caernar-

vonshire, and Cornwall, and giving examples in the Alps, in Sicily, and even in the

wilderness near Mount Sinai, of similar designs ; illustrating his arguments by ori-
ginal drawings made by special pennission fi-om articles in the Ashmolean Museum

at Oxford, and from those of the Palestine Exploration Fund, &c. Eefemng to

the physical features of the localities he had described in Britain, he pointed out

the prevalence of the conical hiU towards the east of such settlements, with a

flowmg stream dividing the one from the other, as in the cases of the Breamish

flowing between Greaves Ash and the Ingram and Eeaveley Hills, the Thames

between Standlake and the Beacon Hill, and the stream between Tolsford Hill

and CjEsar's Camp. Where localities had not the desired featm-es, or they were

not sufficieutly prominent, art was had recourse to, as in tlie Castle Hill at Cam-

bridge, Silbury Hill, &c. He considered these, evidences of the custom of worship
on the tops of such mountains, from their orientation, and recalled the fact of many

mountains still bearing names indicative of Baal- or  Sun-worship                                                      that the flowing

stream formed a division of sanctification or purity ; that each settlement had its
hiU of worship, and that the modern church-spires of the plains had replaced the

aspirino- flame which once ascended from the several tribal districts or divisions

of our land ; and that on or near these places of previous occupancy were founded

our oldest cities.

   From the juxtaposition of ancient British pottery, where large and small urns

were found together, from the lateral perforations of both, distinct from perfora-
tions for suspension (an example of which in the possession of Professor Rolleston

at Oxford has these perforations less than two inches from the bottom of an urn pf

the larger kind), from the material found in the small urns differing from that in
the large, and in one case being a mummified heart-shaped body, he concluded

that thi; preservation of the heart in the small urn was also a custom with these

ancient people.

On IIum.an and Animal Bones and Flints from a Cave at Ohan, Argyleshire.
                                By Professor Turner.

   All who are acquainted with the topography of Oban, Argyleshire, will re-
member that immediately behind the houses, which extend in a long row parallel

to the sea-beach, an almost perpendicidar wall of rock rises to a considerable height.

   At the north end of the bay, near Burn Bank House, the rock rises abruptly
from the road to the height of a little more than 40 feet. Ivy, mountain-ash, and

black-thorn grew out of the chinks in the upper part of the face of the precipice.

A bank of earth sloped from the road, at an angle of about 45°, halfway up the

face of the rock. Growing out of this bank were several beach trees, none of which
had attained any great size ; the diameter of the root of the largest was not more

than 18 inches.

   In the summer of 1869, workmen in the employ of Mr. John Mackay, of Oban,

were engaged in quarrying the north-west face of the rock for building pm-poses,
and after penetrating about 15 feet into the substance of the rock, they opened
into the deeper end of a cave filled with earth in which a number of bones were

found. On the removal of more of the rock and of the bank of earth from its

south-eastern aspect, the cave was more fully exposed, and the position and di-

rection of its original entrance were ascertained.

The rock was a dull purple micaceous sandstone, through which ran thin part-

myings of green sandy shale, and belongs, as  colleague Professor Geikie tells me,

to an outlying area of the Old Red Sandstone.
   The cave consisted of a chamber and an entrance-passage. The chamber was 11

feet high and the same in depth. The entrance-passage was 4 feet high and 9 feet
long, and sloped from the entrance dovra to the floor of the chamber, which it

joined at a decided angle. The mouth of the cave was thus higher than the floor
of the chamber. It faced to the south, and about 20 feet in thickness of an em-
bankment of earth had to be removed before the entrance was exposed. The cave

was almost filled up with earth, in which were foimd numerous bones and flints.

The bones liad no definite an-.angement, but lay in the earth in an irregiilar manner.
The floor of the care was formed of solid rock, its walls were on much of their
surface lined by a white calcareous deposit, 1 to 2 inches in thickness. In the roof
of the cave was a fissure, widened out below, but which higher up was so narrow
as to admit little more than the blade of a knife. The earth within the cave was
moist, and it is probable that water had percolated into the cave through the fis-

msure the roof, and that the calcareous lining' had been deposited from it. For

my information respecting this cave I am indebted to Mr. Mackay, though several

of the points I have referred to I was able to confirm from a personal examination

of the locality made in October last. The bones were transmitted to me by

Mr. Mackay, and were as follows :

The skull and greater part of the skeleton of an adult man. Unfortunately the
myskull was broken to pieces before it came into
                                                  possession, so that it is not pos-
mesible for                   I may state, however, that the superciliary ridges were
             to describe it.

well marked, the lower jaw was powerful, the palatal arch was deep. The teeth
were partially worn but not ground flat on the surfaces of the crowns, and they

Aexhibited no decay. The tibia, femur, and humerus possessed some pecidiarities
in form.     second human skeleton was situated about one yard from the adult.

From the characters of the skidl and of the dentition, it is' obviously that of a
youth about eight or nine years of age.

   The animal bones were mostly those of mammals, but a few bird's bones were
also found. They consisted of the teeth, jaws, and long bones of the roe and red

deer. Skulls and other bones of the common dog. Skulls and other bones of

foxes. Skulls and other bones of a species of Mustela. The humerus and ulna
Aof an otter. Bones of the limbs of the hare. Skull of an Arvicola.
                                                                                                                                                 large
number of the long bones of the red deer, which have been split into fragments, in

all probability for the ready extraction of the marrow. No human bones were found

split in this manner. Fragments of calcined bones. Shells of limpets. Fragments
Aof granite and water-worn pebbles.
                                         number of flint nodides and flint chips

and implements. Some of the nodules are partially chipped, as if in process of

being converted into implements. The nodules are small, and the implements

formed from them are necessarily small also. Is it not possible that the difter-

ences in the size of flint implements met with in different localities may be due to

the fact that flint nodules vary in size in diflerent places, and that the men of the

period had to make their implements of a size such as the materials at their dis-

posal permitted ? The most perfect of these implements have sharp edges all

round, they are comparatively flattened, and in no instance possessed a length of

3 inches, or a greater thickness than about half an inch.

As flint is by no means a common material in Scotland, I was desirous of obtain-

ing from the most competent authority information on the nearest locality from
My Awhich they could have been obtained.
                                         colleague, Prof. Geikie, writes me : "

few years ago I found a bed (20 feet thick) of chalk flints underlying the gi-eat

basalt cliffs of Carsaig, on the south shores of the island of Mull. This is, I believe,

the nearest point to Oban from which flint could be brought."

I think that the examination of the various objects found in this cavern leads to

the conclusion that it had been used as the habitation of man ; for we have not
only the remains of man himself, the animals on which he fed, the dog which he,

without doubt, employed to aid him in the chase, but the implements which he used,

and the raw material out of which those implements  were manufactured                                                                            further,
                                                                                                                                              ;

charred remains, which indicate that he had employed fire to cook his food. The

gi-eat thickness of the embankment of earth in front of the mouth of the cave leads

me to think that it had been closed up by a great landslip of the loose earth from the

summit of the cliff". Perhaps the human inhabitants had been buried alive in their

cavernous dwelling-place.

   It is well known that not only in Scotland, but in various parts of the globe, caves
have been used, and, indeed, in some localities are still used, as human habitations.

"^Miat the exact age of these remains may be it may be difficult to say, but the

association of flint implements with the human and animal bones points to a con-

siderable antic[uit3^

                                                                                                                      Antliropological Institute.

In this paper the author referred to the agreement in physical structure of man

and the ape, and to the fact that the latter possessed the power of reasoning, with
aU the faculties necessary for its due exercise. It was shown, however, that it was
incorrect to affirm that man has no mental faculty other than what the ape possesses.

He has a spiritual insight or power of reflection which enabled him to distinguish
qualities and to separate them as objects of thought from the things to which they

AUbelong.                 language is in some sense the result of such a process, and its exgrcise

by even the most imcivilized peoples is shown in their having words denoting
colours. The possession by man of the faculty of insight or reflection is accom-

panied by a relative physical superiority. The "human brain of man is much larger

than that of the ape, and he has also a much more refined nervous structure, with

a naiied skin. The author observed that the size of the brain was the only physical
fact absolutely necessary to be accounted for, and this could not be done by the

hypothesis of natural selection. Mr. Wallace's reference, on the other hand, to a

creative will, really undermines Mr. Darwin's whole hypothesis. After referring to

the theories of Mr. Murphy and Haechel, the author stated that the only way to

explain man's origin, consistently with his physical and mental connexion with the

ape, is to suppose that nature is an organic whole, and that man is the necessary

result of its evolution. While, therefore, man is derived from the ape as supposed

by Mr. Darwin, it is under conditions very diflerent from those his h-ypothesis re-

quires. According to this, the appearance of man on the earth must have been in

a certain sense accidental ; while, according to the author's view, organic nature

could only have been evolved in the direction of man, who is the necessary result

of such evolution, and a perfect epitome of nature itself.

On certain Points concerning the Origin and Relations of tJie Basque Race.

                                                                                                                         GEOaEAPHT.

                          Address hy Colonel Henry Yule, C.B., President of the Section.

YoxT are aware that the honourable position which has been assigned to me was

originally destined for a gentleman, by labours, knowledge, and reputation through-

out the world as a geographer, far otherwise qualified to fill it. His lamented

removal, within a very short time of the date fixed for this Meeting, compelled

the Council of the Association to make prompt arrangements for the presidency of

the Geographical Section. The distinguished soldier and scholar who has re-

cently succeeded to the chair of the Royal Geogi-aphical Society was unable to at-

tend                      and the officers of the Association thought proper to propose me for the duty.
                       ;

I am quite inexperienced in such office ; whatever claim I have to the character of

a geographer has been acquired in a limited field, and rather from the literary

than the scientific side ; a variety of subjects must come before us with which I

am quite unfamiliar                                                                                              and  I  had  for  these and other reasons abundant misgivings
                                                                                                              ;

as to the fitness of the clioice. But I did not feel at liberty to decline the duty,

especially as it was not the first time that, unsought, it had been proposed to me'
   Even among an entire company of strangers, the circumstances of the case, and

the short time which they allowed for preparation, would, I felt assured, secure

indulgence. When I can count so many countenances of friends around, I feel

that it is needless to plead for it.

   The first natural duty in circumstances like the present is to pay a tribute, how-

ever inadequate, to the memory of the eminent geogi-apher whom we expected to
                                                                             ;

fill this chair. Deeply do I regi-et not to he ahle to speak of him from personal

acquaintance, or even from correspondence. I knew him only hy his works. And
who is there that did not ? The long list of those works has been rehearsed in so
many of the notices that have honoured his memory, as well as in the address of

the Vice-President of the Geographical Society, when presenting the medal which
he had won hy so many years of faithful labour in the cause of Geography, that I
need not now repeat them. Indeed, when contemplating the catalogue of such an

--amount of work achieved, an amateur geographer like myself stands abashed but

feels at the same time that his own limited experience and desultory studies serve

at least to furnish him with some just scale by which to estimate the vast labours

involved in the accomplishment of such a life's work as Dr. Keith Johnston's.
During tliat life's work of five-and-forty years, there was little or no call for mo-

difications in the assigned dimensions or outline of the inhabited continents of the

world, such as were needed in the con-esponding space of years that followed the

first voyages of Columbus and Da Gama. But with the exception of that epoch,
none in history has produced so much change in the atlas of the world, by the

modification and completion of internal spaces that once stood in error or in blank

upon our maps. Think of the growth of knowledge of which we should become
sensible were we to compare sheet by sheet this late geographer's first National

Atlas with the latest editions of the maps of his Royal Atlas! Think of the
changes that we should find in the representation of Central America and Interior

--Afiica, in the Arctic and Antarctic Circles, in Australia, in Central and Northern

Asia, in Indo-Chiua nay, to some extent in India itself! I will conclude these

--remarks by quoting the words used by a friend in writing to me on this subject:
   " I obtained, at various times, from Keith Johnston, information, which he was

always most ready to  give                     and I had an opportunity of learning something of the
                                            ;

wide range of his researches and correspondence, and of his diligence in the pur-

suit of materials for his work. He seemed to be imbued with the modesty and

caution of a true student of a science which is so constantly presenting corrected

views of old knowledge, as well as new facts and new means of investigation

whilst he showed the real delight he had in the labours themselves, no less than in

the attainment of the results."

I shall in this Address attempt no general view of the geogi'aphical desiderata

of the time, and of recent geographical progi-ess in discovery and literature through-

out the world. Living habitually far from new books and meetings of societies, I
am not sufficient for these things ; nor, if I were, could I easily vary from the com-

prehensive epitome of the year's geogi-aphy which, but two months ago, was

issued, though, as we know with sorrow, not delivered, by him who has been so

long the Dean of the Faculty of Geographers in Britain, and whose name is as

thoroughly and as respectfully identified throughout the Continent with English

geography as once was that of Palmerston with English policy. And since I am
naming Sir Roderick Murchison, all, I am sure, will be glad to know that, though

his power of bodily movement is seriously impaired, his general health is fair, his

intellect and his interest in knowledge are as bright as ever ; and as for his me-

mory, I wiU only say I wish mine were half as good ! He has desired me to take

occasion to express his deep regi-et at his inability to be present at this Meeting.

It is, he said, one of the most painfully felt disappointments that his illness has

occasioned ; for he had looked forward with strong interest to taking part once

--more in a meeting of the Association at the chief city of his native countrj' with

which city, I may remind you, he the other day bound his name and memory by

strong and endm'ing ties, in the foundation of a Chair of Geology in this Univer-

Instead, then, of attempting a review which in my case would be crude, and

therefore both dull and unmstructive, I propose to turn to one particular region of

the Old World with which my own studies have sometimes been concerned, and to

say something of its characteristics, and of the progress of knowledge, as well as

of present questions regarding it.

There are, however, one or two points on which I must first touch lightly. Of

Livingstone, all that there is to tell has already been told to the world by Sir Ro-

Wederick Murchison.   know the task that Livingstone had laid out for himself

                                                     H*

in dispevsino- the darkness that still hangs over some of the greatest featvires of

Central-African hydrography, by determining the ultimate course of the great

body of drainao-e which he has followed northward from 12° south latitude -whe-

ther towards the Congo and the Atlantic, or towards Baker's Lake and so to the
Nile,--as well as the kindred question of the discharge of Lake Tanganyika; but

of his proo^'ess in the solution of those questions we know nothing. I can but add

that Sir Roderick himself has lost none of his confidence in the accomplishment
of the task, and in the return of the great traveller at no distant period. That
conhdeuce of his has been so often before justified by the arrival of fresh news of
Livino-stone, however meagre, that we may well retain strong hope, even if it be
Wenot granted to all of us to rise from hope into confidence.
                                                                                       trusty then, that

Livingstone wiU never have a place among the martyrs of geography.                     _

One addition, however, has been made during the past year to that long list, in

the name of the undaunted George Hayward, formerly a lieutenant in the 72nd

Regiment, who had for some years resolutely devoted himself to geographical dis-

covery. After having proved his powers in 'a journey to Yarkand and Kashghar,

which obtained for him last year one of the medals of the Geographical Society,

he had started again, with aid from that Society, to attempt an examination of the

famous Plateau of Pamir, hoping to succeed in crossing it, and to descend upon

the Russian territorv at Samarkand. In the Darkot Pass, above Yassin, he was

foully murdered by the emissaries of the chief of that district, Mir Wall by name.

Public suspicion in India first turned upon the Maharajah of Kashmir, on whose

alleged oppressions Hayward, in a private letter, had made severe remarks, which

were rashly published by the editor of a local newspaper. The latest intelligence

seems to exonerate the Maharajah and to throw the guilt of complicity rather on

the Mahomedan chief of Chitral. If he be the guilty man, it may be difiicult to

punish him, so inaccessible is his position at present ; for, to apply the old saw

of the Campbells, " It is a far cry to Chitral." I may observe, however, that some

sixteen or seventeen years ago a similar murder took place on the persons of two

poor French priests at the other extremity of India, and within the Thibetan

boundary on the Upper Brahmapootra, and the apprehension of the criminal must

have seemed almost as hopeless as in this case. Yet eventually he fell into^ the

hands of our oncers of the province of Asam, and paid the due penalty of his crime.

   One book recently issued by the India Office I wish to bring to notice in a
very few words. I mean Mr. Markham's ' Memoir on the Indian Surveys.' Of

this work, excellent in object and in execution, a pretty full account will be found

in Sir R. Murchison's Address; my object is merely to say how encouraging I

believe a work like this is lilcely to prove to those who are employed on such

duties as the memoir treats of; for they will see that here are recorded with hearty

appreciation, in a book that will be largely read and permanently referred to, the

labours, alw.ays toilsome, often perilous, often fatal, of a great number of zealous
servants of the State, the memory of whose merits would in many cases, but for

this book, have been left to decay amid the dust of the India Office. The prepara-

tion of such a work shows a spirit which has been too often missing in our admi-

nistrators, and is honourable, not only to the author, but to the Department which

has promoted and authorized its publication.

  Within the last few days my attention has been drawn to some maps which have

been recently issued by the Forest Department of India, showing the geographical

distribution of teak and other valuable woods in that country. I regret to learn

that the Forest-management in India is looked upon, by some of those statesmen

who are now interesting themselves in Indian details, too much as regards its mere

results in revenue. But the conservation, and, if possible, the recovery, of forests

of valuable timber is a work which the State alone can touch, and which is of the

highest importance, quite apart from immediate returns in revenue. There were,

I know, some years ago, and no doubt still are, such forest-tracts, where the

only hope  of recovery lay in their entire  closure                                    and from these, of course,
                                                                                    ;

there could be no revenue. During many years of railway construction in India

the waste of valuable timber, an article now comparatively rare and costly in

that country, and for which in many of its purposes there is no substitute, was

lamentable and probably irreparable ! The teak timbers that bind the walls of
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

--dating alike from the fifth or sixth century of our era are still undecayed ! And

--yet myriads of logs of this precious material have been used up and buried in the

ground as railway-sleepers a position in ^Yhich decay was sure to anive in a very
few years--when a very little thought and trouble would have provided an endu-

ring substitute of iron. I believe that had a Forest Department been in earlier

existence, much of this misapplication of valuable material might have been

avoided, or at least the misapplication would not have been at India's cost. Nor

is such waste of resources the only evil that forest-conservancy has to guard against.

The unregulated denudation of extensive tracts has a marked influence on the rain-

fall                   and it is  one of the duties of a forest-consei-vancy                                                                                                                                                  to  see that the sometimes
                    ;

furious demands of the market for timber or fuel do not lead to such general and

imregulated denudation.

The geographical held on which, with your permission, I propose to expatiate

for a little, is that of India beyond the Ganges                                                                                                                                                                              I mean in the largest sense of the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

expression, and inclusive, at least in some points of view, of the Indian Islands.

India, indeed, in old times, was a somewhat vague term, or at least it had always a

vague as well as an exacter interpretation. In the latter, it had the same applica-

tion that we give it now when we speak with precision ; it meant that vast

semipeninsidar region roughly Umited by the valleys of the Indus and the Ganges,
which embraces many nations and many tongues and many climates, but yet aU

pervaded by a certain almost intangible character which gives it a kind of unity

recognized by aU. In its vaguer sense, India meant simply the Far East. The

traces of such use still survive in such expressions as the East Indies or the Indian

Archipelago. Though this vague and large application of the name probably arose

only from the vagueness of knowledge, it coincides roughly with a fact ; and that is

the extraordinary expansion of Hindoo influence, which can be traced in the vestiges

of religion, manners, architecture, language, and nomenclature over nearly all the

regions of the East to which the name has been applied. Another name has been

applied to the continental part of this region, Indo-China. This, too, expresses the

fact that on this area the influence of India and of China have interpenetrated.

But the influence of China has, except on the eastern coast, been entirely political,

and has not, like that of India, affected manners, art, and religion.

   The great elevation that we call the Ilimalya, after passing beyond the utmost

eastern limits of the British province of Asam, is continued in a vast mass of

compressed and rugged mountains, of whose lines we have no exact knowledge,

but which we know still to reach, at points within the bounds of China Proper, a

height of 15,000 feet. In Yunnan these drop into a great plateau, standing at an

average height of some 6000 feet above the sea, on which are planted the chief cities

of that province, whilst branches of mountain-chains extend far to the south and

cast, reaching the sea or its vicinity at Cape Negrais, at Martaban^ in the south-

east of Cochin China, and in Fokien.

Looking at the Map of Central and Southern Asia, we see what a barrier the

Ilimalya forms to the drainage of the plateau of Tibet. The Indus and the Sanpu,

having their sources within that plateau, and at a very short distance from each

other, flow respectively westward and eastward within this banier till they reach

an extreme distance from one another, of about 26° of longitude, before the}' turn

southward and escape into the plains of India.

But eastward from the exit of the Sanpu, the'mountain-banier is forced, within

3° of longitude, by at least six great rivers, counting in that number the Sanpu or

Dihong. These sLx rivers, the Dihong, the Dibong, the Lohit, the Ln-Kiang or

Salwen, the Lantsang or great Camboja river, and the Kinsha or upper stream of

the Yangtse, all derive their origin (I believe the fact is beyond reasonable doubt)

I from far within the Tibetan plateau.
            Another gi-eat river, the Irawadi, comes certainly from the vicinity of Tibet

but whether it derives any considerable stream from within that region is a point

still undecided. The question excited much controversy some forty-five years

ago, when Klaproth made a desperate attempt to prove that the waters of the

Sanpu, instead of flowing into Asam, were really the head-waters of the Irawadi.

The doctrine was backed on Ivlaprotla's part by much Chinese learning, as well as
166 EEPORT 1871.

by violent perversions of ascertained geo<?rapliy, and obtained great currency both
in France and Germany. It is now, I believe, abandoned by every body, with the
exception (and the exception seems at first a serious one) of the French mis-
sionary priests dwelling nearest to that great burst of rivers. But the fact is, that
the elder of these laborious men were taught this doctrine in their youth, and sent
out fm-nished with maps on which this heresy was laid down as positive know-

ledo-e. And instead of correcting their maps by the facts that reached them in the

country, they seem to have felt bound to bend' the facts to this condition of their

maps.               can  reject with    confidence  the  .1          ,.  any                                       ·    1beitween

   But whilst we                                         idea  of             connexion

the Sanpu and the Irawadi, the uncertainty remains whether the Irawadi does

or does not derive  its  chief  source  from within the  Tibetan         plateau.                                       The positive
                                                                                                                     _

evidence is much perplexed ; and though a dissertation on the subject appears in

the last Geographical Journal, I do not find that this adds materially to our light on

the matter. Doubts are expressed in the same paper whether the rivers Salwen

and Mekong come down from much beyond the 27th degree of latitude. But here

there is really no room for such doubt. The Mekong has been crossed as a lar^e
river by that adventurous traveller, Mr. Cooper, above the line of 29°. He did

not see the Salwen, but he was vdthin a few miles of it in the same latitude, and

knew it well by report. And the French missionaries, who for many years had an

establishment upon its banks above lat. 28°, speak of it as a great aiver. These

facts are in entire accordance with the Maps compiled by D'Anville from the

Jesuit surveys, and with the Chinese hydrogi-aphies translated in the Jesuit collec-

tions. The approximate delineation of these rivers, however, all the way from

our Asam frontier to the banks of the Kinsha or Upper Yang-tse, is one of the

most interesting problems remaining in this part of Asia, and is connected with

that other most interesting practical problem, the opening of direct commimication

between China and India.

   Besides the rivers of which we have been speaking there are others of a high

class, such as the rivers of Siam and Tongking, which rise far within the Indo-
Chinese region itself. Indeed nowhere, I believe, in the world can so many great

rivers be found flowing parallel to the sea within so narrow a span. And we shall

see how these rivers and the intervening mountain-ranges have affected the occu-

pation of the country.

   And here I would digress for a moment.

  We heard yesterday, in the General Committee of this Association, an ardent

protest against the deogi-aphical and other Sections for appropriating papers of

JEthnological character. I should be far from presuming to maintain, in the face of
the importance, interest, and bulk that ethnology has so rapidly assumed of late

years, that it shoidd not have a field in the Association as independent as its

votaries may desire. But I do protest against the proposition that a Geographical

Section should be precluded from entertaining papers that deal with ethnology,

or any other subject that the forty volumes of the 'Journal of the Geographical

Society ' embrace. The fields of the different sciences, even the purest, are not, like
the " marks " of our Saxon ancestors, patches cleared in a forest that encompasses

each and makes a broad separation between one and another. Their circles inter-

sect ; and the branch of knowledge which we call geography is deeply intersected

by those of other sciences, or rather is made up of appropriations from other sciences
Weapplied to its own purpcses.
                                        object to have it partitioned, like Poland, among

the adjoining empires. The ethnology of a coimtry is intimately bound up with its

Wegeography.        shall not gi-udge that the ethnologist, in his own Section, should

deal with geographical considerations ; neither let him grudge that any man who

prefers to stand upon the old ways, and deal vnth the ethnology of any country as

a part of its geography, should be allowed to do so.

  The nations who inhabit this great region are, as you know well, entirely diverse

in race from the genuine Hindu, and all or nearly aU belong to the Mongoloid tj'pe,

and are supposed on fair gTounds, not unsupported in some cases by tradition, to

have descended from the high tracts of the Transhimalyan countries. Exceptions

exist, on the one hand, in some fragmentary Negi-ito tribes ; on the other hand we

see it alleged in one of the preliminary notices that have alone yet appeared of
                         TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                            167

the recent French expeditiou up the Mekong, that certain Tribes are Caucasian ia

--feature. This, however, probably does not merit much stress. The same has often

been said of the Karens of Pegu a case in which apparently partiality misled the
iudgmeut ; for Sir Arthm' Phayre testifies that the Karen national physiognomy

--IS essentially Indo-Chinese like their language though in every Indo-Chinese

tribe, as he notes, and as I have often obsei-ved, occur occasional and sometimes

remarkable exceptions to the prevailing type.

The occupation of this region has seemed to the most diligent students of the

characters and languages of these nations to have occurred in something like the

following order.

   Dark relics of the earliest human occupation are probably the Negrito races
found in fragmentary settlements in the Andaman Islands, perhaps (as there is now

strong evidence for be]ie\-ing) in the great Nicobar Island, in the spinal mountains of

the Malay peninsula and in the Philippine Islands, not to speak of remoter regions.

The singular isolation and dispersion of a race so low in civilization seems almost to
suggest the idea that they are the surviving waifs of some submerged continent.

   13ut supposing the other races to have descended from beyond the Ilimalya,

we must assign to the migration of the Malay nations the earliest date. They

seem to have left upon the continent as their nearest kinsmen the Chains or people
of C/iainpa, if these were not rather a reflex wave of colonization from the islands.

--To an early tide of migration southward would seem also to belong : the Mons or

Talaings, who occupied the deltas of the L-awadi and the Salwen, the upper part
of the Malay peninsula, and probably some part of the valley of the Menam ; the

Kilmer, or Kambojans, occupying the lower v.alley and Delta of the Mekong, and
flowing over into the Siam basin like the Mons from the other side ; and the Anam,

or people of Tongkiug and Cochin China. To these may have succeeded the great
family of the Lau, Thai or Shans, who flrst occupied the plateau and high valleys
of Yunnan, the middle basin of the Mekong, and the upper part of the Siam basin.

In later days this race has flowed back upon the Upper Irawadi and the Brah-
maputra, aud has spread south to the coasts of Siam and the Malay peninsula.

   The Karens, and perhaps some others of the lai-ger hill-tribes allied to them on
the borders of the Irawadi, probably followed. Then we have the Marama or
Burman race, apparently descending the Irawadi, pressing before them the Mons
into the Delta, 'the Khyens and like tribes into the bordering mountains. One

great branch of the Burmans, by themselves reckoned the elder, passes over the

mountains to the shores of the Bay of Bengal, shores which, according to their tra-
ditions, they find occupied by JJili/s, or Bakkas--that is, by ogres or cannibal

monsters, from whom in after days the country got its name of Rakhain or Aracan,

the country of the ogi-es.

As usual, the course of civilization, like that of occupation, has mainly foUojved

that of the great rivers, those highways of the primeval world ; and their valleys

and deltas have been the seat of the more civilized monarchies.

Of these nations that we shall call civilized, then, we have the Burmese still occu-

pviug the valley of the  Irawadi and the  coast-plains  and valleys of Aracan                                                                                     with
                                                                                                                                                               ;

the exception of those whom we have made the Queen's subjects, they are still all

united under one monarchy. The jVnamites occupy the eastern shores, and are

also now so united, except such as have become subjects of France. Between these

two is found the great Shan race, whose settlements are difiused from the banks of

the Brahmaputra to the Malay coasts and the delta of the Mekong, divided under

an infinity of petty princes and tributary to a variety of sovereign governments,

parted sometimes widely from one another by populations of alien blood, but every-

where displaying a fair amoimt of civilization, everywhere possessing letters and the

--Buddhist religion, and everywhere speaking substantially the same language cir-

cumstances that seem to corroborate what the traditions of the race assert, bothin
Siam and in the remote interior, that they are the fragments of some great community

shattered and dispersed. Some fatal want of coherence has split the race into

a great number of unconnected principalities, many of which are incorporated in
the Chinese province of Yunnan, and others tributary to Burma or to Siam. The

latter monarchy (Siam) is now apparently the only independent Shan state of any

Aimportance in existence.   portion of the race are foimd in what is now om- own

proTince of Asam, wliieli they first entered in the thirieentli centuiy as conquerors.
The 3fun or Takings of Pegu, the EJwier of Kauiboja, the Cham of Champa have

also been famous in their days ; hut they are now shrunken and decayed, and seem

likely to be absorbed by the races of gTeater vitality that encompass them.
   These chief races have played the historic part ou the field of Indo-China, which

countries like England, France, Germany, or Spain have played on the continent
of Europe ; and each in turn has spread its conquests over wide tracts beyond its
national frontiers. Champa, Kamboja, Siam, Pegu, Pagan, and probably Yunnan
as a Shan state, to say nothing of the island monarchies, have, with immense vicis-

situde, in turn been the seats of extensive empires and the subjects of great disasters.
But besides these there is a vast mass of races of inferior importance, and generally
termed wild or uncivilized. The fact, however, is that their ci^dlization varies through

every degree of the scale except the highest. Many of them are inferior to the so-
called civilized races whom they border only in the absence of a vratten language,
whilst others are head hunters in almost the lowest depths of savagery. Some

are as elaborate in the cultivation of their rice-terraces as the Chinese themselves

others migrate in the forest from site to site, burning down at each remove

new areas on which to carry on their rude hand-husbandry. Nearly all on the

frontiers of the States claiming civilization are the victims of "kidnappers and inter-

national slave-traders.

  Among these, so to call them, uncivilized tribes, none are more worthy of note
and of interest than those called Karen, of whom so great a number have in our
own time become Christian under the teaching chiefly of American missionaries.

Even before this closer claim upon our interest arose, they were remarkable for the
value of their traditions, both religious and what we may call historical. Thus they

were distinguished from all other Indo-Chinese tribes by their recognition of the ex-

istence of one eternal God. They did not worship him ; for, they said. He was angiy

with them. They believed that their nation had once possessed a holy book, but

they had lost it. According to one strange version of the legend, a dog ate it

Their historical legends were almost as remarkable ; these related how their

ancestors, on their great migration, had to cross the Biver of Munning Sand, the
name and description of which point apparently to the terrors of the Gobi. They

also relate how they found the Shans in occupation of the territory to which they

were bound, probably tlie upper Meuam. And the Karens cm-sed them, saying,
" Dwell ye in the dividing of countries," the applicability of which what has

already been said about the Shans will interpret.
   Spealnng generally, the Languages of all these races, civilized or wild, are mono-

syllabic and nasal, with distinctive tones analogous to those of the Chinese, and
belong to the same great class with the languages of Thibet and the Himalayan

tribes. The written characters employed by the civilized nations, with one excep-
tion, are various modifications of Indian writing. The Cochin Chinese seem never to
have possessed a similar alphabet, and have no memory of any but the Chinese ideo-

graphic character. In the Malay Islands also exists a variety of written characters

which it is more difficult to trace to the same Indian root, though they are probably

derived from it. If so, they have been carried into wide deviation by modifications,
probably springing out of the various implements originally employed, whether

the knife-edge upon a bamboo, the graving tool upon stone, the style-point upon

the palm-leaf, the steatite pencil upon blackened paper, or black pigments upon
slips of wood or ivory.

   It is not a little remarkable that, whilst in India Proper there has come down to

us scarcely more than one genuine ancient historical record, all the states of Indo-

China, even the petty ones of Interior Laos, haA'e from early times preserved chro-

Hownicles of their respective dynasties.  far these go back with any claim to truth,

I am not prepared to say ; but certainly from the twelfth century, or thereabouts,

their chronology seems to be genuine and trustworthy ; for in various comparisons

of such fragments of these annals as have been translated, we find a remarkable

agreement both mutually and with the facts recorded in the annals of China, which

contain so many notices of the border states.

  We spoke some time ago of the remains of Hindu influence which can be traced

all over these regions. How and when this influence began, we have no real know-
                                                                                      !!                                                               ;·;

ledge. The Hindus liad elaborate poetry, subtle philosophies, logic, gi'amniar, pro-

sody, mathematics, and astronomy, but, as has already been said, no history. Yet

that this influence was flowing out in pulses eastward from an early date, and per-
haps long before our era, there can be no question.

   Take the island of Java as an example. The people now universally profess

Mahomedanism, and Mecca is the quarter to which they are taught to look in
prayer. But throughout the island are still found the most abundant traces of in-

tercourse ^\-ith India, and of the settlement of highly civilized colonies of Hindus.
The language, radically quite distinct, is largely engrafted with Sanskrit words

the names of the sacred lands of Hindu tradition are attached to the districts of the

island ; the legendary poems of the people embody the substance of tlie great

Hindu epics, the Mahabharat and the Ramayana. The soil of the island is strewn

with Hindu idols                                                                      the  Indian  system of  ^-il'lage communities stands there with  a
                                                                                   ;

completeness rarely now to be found on its native soil ; the ancient Hindu institu-

tion of the Jury of Five was found implanted among the immemorial usages of

Java ; and numerous architectm-al remains of great magnificence, adorned some of

them with sculptured galleries to which I scarcely know a parallel, show in aU

their details the presence of Indian art and Indian worship. The art is dead ; the
worship is dead ; and no coherent histoiy relates their migration across the seas.
But there are the remains of both, pointing unerringly to their source.

That which is true in this respect of Java is true also in a degree and with Varia-

tion of Ai-acan, Pegu, Burma, Siam, Laos, Camboja ; it is true, in part, of Sumatra

and the Malay peninsula, faintly, and probably with only a reflex origin in Borneo,
wliere temples of Hindu type are said to exist far in the interior. Nay, traces of
Hindu language have passed at some uncertain period, but probably through Malays

or Javanese, into the languages of the Philippine Islands and of remote Madagascar.

China itself came under the potent influence of Hindu religion in the form of

Buddhism. Indian words and the forms of Indian architecture could only exist

in China after thorough assimilation to the fantastic stjde of that peculiar people

but I believe both are to be ti-aced. Sanskrit inscriptions may be seen on monu-

ments of antiquity not far from Peking. Thousands of volumes of Sanskrit works

on Buddhistic divinity were carried to China in the early centuries of oiu- era,

there earnestly studied and translated into Chinese. For a space of several

centuries a succession of devout Chinese pilgi-ims accomplished, by sea or by land,

the long journey westward to India as the Holy Land of their faith, and travelled

from shrine to shrine, from spot to spot consecrated by the events in the life of the
Hindu Sakya Buddha, just as contemporary pilgrims in Christendom made their

journeys by sea and land to the Holy Sites of Palestine, or the Convent of St.

Catharine on Sinai.

  A distinguished. Indian archaeologist, a brother oflicer of mine, has lately pub-

lished a learned volume on the Ancient Geogi-aphj' of India. And of what does it

consist ? Almost entirely of an endeavour to track the steps of one of those Chi-

nese pilgi-ims of the 7th century, and, by the aid of the memoirs that he left behind

him, to locate and identify the cities and kingdoms of India at that epoch.

In something, one might fancy, of propiietic strain, and in dim presentiment of

our English Empire in India, the great King Alfred sent one of his Thanes, Sig-

helm of Shirebm-n, with oflerings to the tomb of St. Thomas the Apostle on the

surf-beaten shore of Coromandel. Near the same shore stood a magnificent shrine

--of Buddhist worship, one of the sacred places visited hj those pilgrims fi-om Cathay

a shrine whose gorgeous sculptures, rescued from destruction by the zeal of one

Scotchman, Sir Walter Elliot, and rescued from oblivion by the skill and learning

of another, Mr. Fergusson, now stand in dumb amazement in the court of the India

oflice at Westminster

   The Chinese pilgrim from the far East, and the Saxon envoy from the far West,

might easily have met upon those shores. What a subject for an imaginary con-

versation suggests itself

Buddhism imdoubtedly, with its spirit of propagandism, was a most powerful

agent in the development of Indian influence among the Indo-Chinese nations ; but

probably that influence had been felt at a still earlier date. Among the names of

towns and islands on the coasts and seas of the fui'ther East, as given by Ptolemy,
                                                                                                                        ;

--170 REPORT 1871.

several are almost certainly of Hindu origin ; one at least is interpreted by tlie
geographer himself according to its moaning in the Indian language, and the inter-
pretation is correct. Still it is possible that these names were given subsequently

to the first Buddhist movements in that direction ; for it is recorded that after the
third Buddhist sjmod, held at the city of Pataliputra or Palibothra, now Patna, as
early as b.c. 211, missionaries were dispatched to propagate the doctrine in the
Suvarna Bhumi, or Golden Land, which is almost certainly Pegu, the Chrijso,

Aurea Reqio, or rather, perhaps, Aurea Cliersonesm of the ancients.
   Probably a later and larger wave of migration and propagandism took place not

louf after the Christian era ; for it is remarkable that most of those nations of tlie
further east that have been tinged with Indian civilization, recognize the Indian
era of Salivahana, which is coincident with the year 78 of our reckoning. Another
indication of movement eastward about this time is, perhaps, the fact that it is soon

after this that cloves, if not other peculiar spices of the Eastern Islands, first appear

in the markets of the "Western World.

Later still, about the 5th and 6th centuries, we recognize in the coincident

traditions of the nations a new efflux of influence in the same direction ; but this

time it comes not from Continental India, but from Ceylon, an island which, though

thoroughly Indianized in its religion and manners, has yet some remarkable afflni-

ties in the nature of its products, and perhaps also in that of its people, with those

of the further east.  This  last  impulse  has  never  entirely worn  out                    and                    as  the
                                                                                          ;

Western world in general has looked to Rome, or the Russian world to Constan-

tinople, rather than to Jerusalem as the immediate seat of ecclesiastical sanctity,
80 those Indo-Chinese nations look still, in a degree, to Ceylon as the Mother of

their Faith.

   I have said that, in the countries of which we speak, Indian influence can be

largely traced, not only in religion, but in manners, architecture, language, and

nomenclature ; and indeed the foreign religion necessarily aftects all these.

Throughout these regions we find, in such matters as the etiquettes of the Blood-

Royal, the forms of royal palaces and court ceremonial, an extraordinary identity,
and aU pointinfj to ancient Hindu usages ; the titles of the monarchs and digni-

taries almost universally embrace high-sounding terms of Sanskrit, or rather of Pali,

bearing to Sanskrit much the same relation that Italian bears to Latin, that being
the dialect in which the Buddhist sacred books were read in Ceylon, and which

is still studied as the sacred tongue in Burma, Siam, and Camboja. In Java, by a

strange enough chain of circumstances, we find the very title of Arya, Noble or

Excellent, which has been adopted as the distinctive note of our Indo-germanic
races, assumed by every one claiming nobility among a people of kindred and cha-

racter so diverse from our own.

   As regards the nomenclature of these countries, we find Hindu names extending
at least as far east as Southern Cochin China, a country long known as Champa
or Mahd-champa, a title now confined to a small corner to which the one predo-
minant race in later times was limited. This Champa was a name borrowed from a

famous Indian state upon the Ganges, occupying the modern district of Bhagalpiir.

The Idngdom of  Camboja had       its name from a  region beyond  the Indus                                         another
                                                                                                                 ;

region in the same quarter, Gandhdra, the country round Peshawar, lent its name

to Yunnan, now a Chinese province, but still so styled in Burmese state-papers

Ayoclhija, the ancient city of Rama, from which is corrupted our modern Oudh,

gave its name to great cities both in Siam and in .lava ; the holy city of Mathra
on the Jumna has bestowed its name both on an island dependency of Java and

on a town of Upper Burma ; Irawadi, the great river of Burma, is but another

Airavafi, the river-name which the companions of Alexander in the Panjab wi'Ote

as Hydraotes Amarapura, the recent capital of Burma, has a name purely Indian
                                                             ;

Sinyhaptira, or Singapore, founded by a Javan colony in the middle ages, and

refounded in our own century by the ardent spirit of Stamford Raffles, is the same.
And so ad infinitum.

   But it is in the great architectural remains scattered widely over this region that
we find the most striking monuments of Indian influence. The original races are

none of them addicted to architecture in solid materials, and have long ceased, as

a general rule, to use either stone or brick in their own constructions; vxnless it be
                                   TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.            171

for tlie ramparts of their cities, for the elevated platforms of their timber palaces,

or for the solid domes which form the symbols to which Buddhist worship is

directed. Yet in all, or nearly all, these countries we hud remains of an elaborate

and grandiose architectiu-e devoted to religious purposes. Such are the ancient

Javan temples, generally built of hewn stone, and including the extraordinary

pyramid of sculptured terraces called Boro Bodor. Temples analogous to those

of Java have been found in Sumatra, and in connexion with one of them a San-

skrit inscription as old as tlie seventh century ; in Burma we find them of fine

brickwork, in the remains of the great medieval citj' of Pagan, on the Irawadi

river, whose ruins cover many square miles, and still exhibit several grand

structures rising to a height of nearly 200 feet ; others, also of brick, exist in the

dense jungles which cover the remains of Yutbia in Siam. And but lately we

--have become acquainted with the vast remains of Cambojan architecture im-

mense temples and corridors of hewn stone, with furlongs of sculptured bas-reliefs.

In Champa remains of similar character are alleged to exist ; but we have no

account of them. Each of these diU'erent series of remains has its own peculiar

characters ; but often there are close resemblances of general design, and in the or-

namental detail throughout the whole of the series there is much of this resem-

blance                             and that is of Indian character.  Yet it must be said that, of the build-
                                ;

ings as wholes, we hud no type anywhere in India. Recently I have been much

struck by photographs of ancient remains in Ceylon, in the possession of Mr. Fer-

gusson, which afford strong corroboration of a suspicion long ago expressed by

myself, that the nearest archetype and common parent of these structures may

have been in that island.

Time compels me to omit much that I had noted regarding the progress of our

Imowledge of these countries, and to hasten down to our own times.

   After the mission of Colonel Symes and Dr. Francis Buchanan to Ava in 1795,
no material advance was made in our knowledge of these regions till the time of

the first Burmese war, in 1824-26. For several years from that time the British

Government in India exhibited a zeal for the extension of geographical knowledge

Asuch as rarely possesses any Government. little army of surveyors and explorers

were thrown upon the frontier of Asam ; and the remote territories lying between

Asam and Bengal on the one side, and Northern Burma on the other, were partially

explored. Some of our officers traversed Northern Burma from Ava to the frontiers

of Asdm and Silhet ; others, starting from Maulmain, A'isited tnost of the Western

Shan States from the neighbourhood of Ava to the Siamese capital. And in 1837

Lieutenant (now General) William Macleod, of the Madras Ai-my, accomplished

the most important journey that had been made, by penetrating across more than

half the breadth of the peninsula to the remote state of Kiang-Hung on the great

Camboja river, and close to the frontier of China.

After this the abnormal fire of exploration, which the forced collision with Ava

had developed in the Government, seemed utterly to die out.

The credit of kindling it again to some extent has been undoubtedly due to the

agitation which certain gentlemen have canied on with amazing persistence for

many years, in order to promote the opening of an overland trade with China from

Rangoon.

For many centuries a considerable land-trade has been maintained between

Western China and the valley of the Irawadi. As long ago as 1459, we find on tlie

--great Venetian Map of Fra Mauro a rubric attached to a certain point of the upper

waters of the river of Ava " Here goods are transferred from river to river, and
so pass on into Catbay." And as early as the first half of the seventeenth century,

there is some evidence that the East-India Company had a factory or agent at

Bhamo. Of this trade the staple export from China used to be the silk of Ssechuan,

and that from Burma cotton ; but many minor articles contributed to its aggregate.

The object of the agitation to which I have alluded has been to stimulate the

Indian Government to take measures for drawing a similar trade in the produce of

Western China to our ports on the Bay of Bengal, and, as necessary for that object,

to promote the construction of a railroad from Rangoon to the Cliinese frontier

beyond the Mekong. Meantime the trade by the old route from Talifu in Yunnan

to Bhamo had ceased ; and to explain this, a slight digression is needful.
173 BEPOKT--1871.

   It is a remarkable circumstance that in our own older Indian territory there is
no province where Mahomedanism is so extensivelj^ professed among the peasantry
as the remote and secluded district of Silhet, in the east of Bengal. And China

affords a curious parallel ; for there is no one of the eighteen provinces of China
Proper iu which Mahomedanism is so prevalent as in the secluded inland province

of Yunnan. And this has been the case from a very early period. Ah-eady, in the

13th century, a celebrated Persian historian of the Mongols states, though no
doubt with great hyperbole, that in Yunnan all the people were Mahomedans.
Since about 1855 this Mussulman population has been in a state of revolt against

the Imperial Government ; and, after wars which have devastated the greater part
of the province and which indeed still continue to do so, a part of the Mahomedans
have succeeded in establishing their independence in Western Yunnan, under a

sultan of their own election, who bears the name of Suleiman, and reigns at Talifu.

The anarchy of civil war and the interruption of communication between the Im-

perial and the Mahomedan parts of the province; as may easily be imagined, have

brought the trade practically to a standstill.

Several expeditions of exploration and survey to the eastward and north-eastward

of om- province of Pegu resulted from the stimulus of agitation ; but the most im-
portant of these undertakings was that despatched imder Major Sladen, political

agent at the Court of the King of Burma, to visit the Mahomedan authorities in

Western Y^unnan, and to endeavour to bring about a reopening of the trade.

Notwithstanding every promise of support on the part of the King of Bm-ma, and

of ostensible orders issued in that sense, the expedition was grievously harassed and

retarded by most vexatious proceedings on the part of the Burmese provincial

--officers a course ascribed by Major Sladen to bad faitli and ill--n'ill on the pai't of

the Court itself, but by Sir Arthur Phayre rather to the jealousy of the Chinese

merchants, who feared that the trade might revive only to pass out of their

hands.

Major Sladen did eventually make his way to Momien, the first city of China

met with on passing that frontier ; and to him belongs the credit of being the first
European to pass that frontier from the side of the Irawadi. lie was most cordially
received by the Mahomedan Governor ; and his visit ascertained that there was per-
fect good will on the part of the Mahomedan authorities towards the reestablish-

ment of trade. But the causes which had brought it to a stop still existed, and

the goodwill of the rulers could do nothing material to restore trade until order

and peaceful communication with the interior of China should be reestablished.

  A year and a half before the commencement of Major Sladen's journey, another one

of a very remarkable character had been undertaken under the orders of the French

Imperial Government. This was an expedition for the exploration of the Mekong, or

Great Camboja River, starting from the recently acquired French territory in the

delta of that river. Before I was called so unexpectedly to occupj' this chair, I had

commenced the compilation, from the imperfect materials accessible, of an account of

this expedition, which I look on as the most important geographical enterprise that

has been accomplished in Asia, at least since Burues's journey to Bokhara. The

work of preparation for the duties of the Section prevented me from making any

progress with the paper, though I hope on one day of our sitting to give a sketch

of the journey. I will only say now that the mission party, consisting mainly of

naval officers, ascended the river, first by boat and afterwards by land, to Kiang-

Hung, the point reached thirty years before by Macleod. Here they were compelled
to abandon the line of the Mekong ; but starting to the north-east they entered the

Chinese frontier at Ssemao (the Esraok of Macleod), and travelled across Southern

Y''imnan to the capital city of the province, almost everj' where tolerably well received

Aby the Chinese authorities.  detachment of the party under Lieutenant Garnier

succeeded in reaching Talifu ; but they had to leave it'immediately, at the peril of

their lives ; and on their return to Toug-chuau, where they had "left their chief.
Captain De la Gree, seriously ill, they found that his death had occurred a few days

before. Taking his remains with them, they proceeded to the Great Kiang at

Siuchau, and thence descended to Shanghai, in reaching which they completed a

India from Ssechuau, find again, witli singular perseverance, to reach China from

Asam.

The French expedition ascertained that there is no hope of using the Mekong

as a commercial route from Yunnan. Tliough large spaces of its course aft'ord

good navigation, this is not only inteiTupted at no great distance from the head

of the delta by actual cataracts, but at intervals by long tracts of rapids, and above

the frontier of the Burmese Tributary States the river becomes so rapid as to be

continuously quite unfit for navigation. Much the same has been ascertained of

the Salweu. Neither of these rivers, therefore, can be turned to account for com-

munication with Western China, The Irawadi remains ; and the experience of
Major Sladen's ascent to Bhamo, during the month of January, in a steamer navi-

gated entirely by Burmese officers and crew, appears to show that this river is

fairly navigable to that station by steamers dr.awing not more than 4 feet of

water.

Many startling and inconsiderate statements appear in the memorials and other

--documents which have been addressed to Government on the subject of the new

routes for trade with China as, for example, when the agitators of the question

talk of thereby opening up a new trade for our country with 200 millions of people,

--occupyiug extensive and rich portions of the earth as if, forsooth, the trade and

products of a vast and varied portion of the earth's surface, merely because that

portion happens to be described by one name as China, were like the water in a
lake, which may all possibly be drained dry if but tapped at a single point in one

of its narrow creeks. The moderation and cautious good sense of one of the

memorials, however, forms so striking and refreshing a contrast to such statements

--as I have referred to, that I will quote it almost in full ; it is not long : " Your

memorialists have long entertained the opinion that it would be of the utmost im-

portance to the commerce of this country if a route were opened between Rangoon

and the interior of Western China  The information which your memo-

rialists possess on the district through which the various routes hitherto proposed

pass, does not justify them in expressing any decided opinion either vdth regard

to any one of these proposed routes, or as to the practicability of opening any

route. But the memorialists would respectfully urge upon Her Majesty's Govern-

ment the propriety of completing the survey which has already been commenced,

with the view of authoritatively establishing whether it is practicable to open up

such a line of communication." And I am happy to observe that this dignified

and reasonable memorial comes from the commercial metropolis of Scotland                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  it  is

the memorial of the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce and Manufactures.

The probability of a great attraction of China trade to the ports of Pegu,

even if there were a good highway opened out to the Chinese frontier, depends

not on rhetorical statements about tlie vast population and products of the Ce-

lestial Empire, but (and here I will borrow a felicitous expression which I

remember to have been applied in ludia by that admirable public servant the

present Governor of Jamaica, Sir John Peter Grant) on the question where the

--trade-shed of that produce shall be found to exist a question on which I have

never seen any great light thrown. As regards the important part of the export

trade at least, we have to look not to Yunnan and Kwei-Chau, which are in the

main mountainous regions, and comparatively unproductive, but to Ssechuau. I

observe that Mr. Cooper, a sensible and on this point quite unprejudiced observer,

does consider that a large part of the produce of Ssechuau would seek an outlet by

the Irawadi if the land route were again open. Looking to the length of land

journey from the fertile portions of Ssechuau to Bhamo, this opinion certainly

surprises me. But the fact is that we know extremely little of the extraordinary

skill of the Chinese in utilizing rivers which we should in this country regard as

mere trout-streams, for internal na^^gation, or of the extent to which such means

Myapply in reducing the length and cost of the route in question.  own impres-

sion is that the Yangtsi?, in spite of all the difficulties of its upper reaches, as being

free from the complications of a double frontier, and the anarchy of tribes imper-

fectly controlled, will carry to the sea for many years to come the produce of Sse-

chuau and Central Yunnan, rather than any outlet by Burma or the Shan States.

I do not myself see how the long land-route by Kiang-Hung could become attrac-

tive without a raiboad; and the construction of a railroad in such a direction

certainly seems to me visionary. Coming- to practical questions, who is to pay

for such a scheme ? The Government of these islands? The question needs no
answer. The gentlemen who are so ready to memorialize Government on the
subject ? If they will, it is well ; but I doubt it. If in our own old Ind.ian territory,'
after railways have been making for twenty years, it has been found impossible to

get a single line of railway undertaken except with a guarantee (that is to say, prac-

tically, as the guarantees are, at the cost of the Government), is it likely that men

who withhold their money there, will risk it in driving a railway through a
scantily peopled and almost unknown region to tap a remote corner of China ?
Is it, then, the Indian Government that is to be at this expense ? I remember how

a somewhat similar system of agitation induced a former (Secretary of State, in op-

position to the views of tlie Indian Government, to sanction the guarantee of a

--short but costly railway on like speculative grounds I mean from Calcutta to

an uninhabited swamp upon a creek of the Delta, which it was expected would
prove a great harbour of commerce ; but that line is now almost a pure dead weight

upon the Indian revenue. The Indian Government is already sufficiently bur-
dened with railway guarantees, to say nothing of the immense amount of work

already laid out, and still to be done, in completing its domestic railway system.

When mutterings of discontent on account of increased or changing taxation are

beginning to be heard so audibly in India, a wise Government will hold back for a

time from measures of almost sure benetit, rather than disregard a warning so omi-

nous. And it would be mad, under such circumstances, to engage its revenues in

costly and specidative schemes for the extension of British commerce so proble-

matical as this.

 --What I think we may reasonably hope for is : first, to see Western China tran-

quillized, and the old channel of trade restored and stimulated by the access of

British steamers to Bhamo ; secondly, from gradual but inevitable political change

in our own relations to the Burmese Government, I should expect to see our
own influence brought into more direct operation at Bhamo, so that we shall be

able to act either inthe suppression of marauding, or in opening out by engineer-

ing the short road to the Chinese frontier cities, unhampered by such paltry ob-

stacles as the intrigues of Burmese underlings, or the jealousies of Chinese traders.

And I venture to think that our Government, as a general rule, need neither

grudge the small cost of surveys and explorations beyond our frontier, nor he-

sitate to apply some degree of pressure on native governments to sanction

such measures, without which these governments are apt to think us not in

earnest in our proposals. If my memory does not deceive me, our Minister at

Peking, in 1860, declined even to apply to the Chinese Regency for passports for

an expedition which Lord Canning had sanctioned for exploration in Thibet, and

in consequence a promising geographical enterprise Avas abandoned. The French

Minister, in 18G6, was less punctilious in pressing a similar demand. The expe-

dition of the Mekong was in  consequence  furnished with  imperial  passports                                     and
                                                                                                               ;

these passports, even in such a time of civil war and confusion, backed by tact and

energy, secured them everywhere in China a decent, and sometimes a cordial

reception, as well as free passage through those hitherto untraversed provinces.

comparing the intensity of gravity on an island station with that at inland stations

station like Minicoy greater than on the coast. The island is of coral formation,

On the Ruined Cities of Central America. By Captain L. Brine, R.N.

The author stated that it was not imtil the year 1750 (more than 200 years

after the Spanish conquest) that the existence of ruined cities and temples lying

hidden in the jungles and forests of Central America was revealed to the know-

Aledge of the Spanish Government.                                small party of Spaniards, travelling in the

State of Chiapas, happened to diverge from the usual track leading from the

southern limit of the Gulf of Mexico to the Mexican Cordilleras, and accidentally

--discovered in the dense forest remains of stone buildings palaces and temples

with other evidences of a past and forgotten civilization of. a very high order.

These ruins were those of Palenque. Some years subsequently to this discovery,

the King of Spain ordered an official survey to be made, and this survey was made

in 1787 under the direction of Captain del Rio. Later official surveys were also

made in 1806 and 1807 ; but these, with the usual secrecy' of the Spanish con-

querors, were not generally made public, and thus it happened that only as recently

as the year 1822, at the revolution of Mexico, did the existence of these ruins first

become known in Europe. Since then other hidden cities or temples had been

--discovered Copan, in the State of Honduras Ocosingo, on the frontiers of Gua-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

famous. It was very remarkable that all these ruins, evidently the work of one

(articular and highly civilized race of Indians, should only be found in a very

fimited area. None exist in South America, and none in that part of the conti-

nent commonly distinguished as North America ; they aU lie within the Tropics,

between the 14th and 22nd parallels of north latitude, and were chiefly adjacent

to the Mexican and Honduras Gulfs, or in the plains on the west of the Cordil-

leras of Central America. On the eastern or Pacific slopes and plateaux, within

the same parallels, are also remains of ancient fortifications and sacrificial altars,

but these are of a less elaborate type, and are allied to the Aztecan structures of

Mexico. The author gave an account of a journey made by him across the con-

tinent in the spring of last year, from the Pacific, through Guatemala, to the

Atlantic; he examined in detail the mixed populations and conditions of the

countries between the Cordilleras and the Pacific, the central plateaux, with their

aboriginal Indian races and ruins, the region (almost entirely unknown) inhabited

by those unbaptized Indians called the Candones, near which lie the ruins of

Ocosingo and Palenque ; he concluded the journey by traversing Yucatan, visiting

the strange ruins with which the country abounds, and emerging on the northern

coast of the Peninsula at Sisal.

               The Interior of Greenland. By Dr. Robert Brown.

   After reviewing the old ideas of the nature of the interior. Dr. Brown spoke at
length of the views which his own studies and those of others had led him to.
Various more or less successful attempts had been made to penetrate into the
interior, viz. by Dalager, Kielssen, RinK, Hayes, Rae, Nordenskjold and Bei'g-
gren, various Danish officers and Eskimo on hunting trips, &c., and one in which,

·with his companions MM. E. Whymper, A. P. Tegner, C. E. Olsen, J. Fleischer, and

an Eskimo, he had shared in. The result of all these expeditions showed that the
interior is one huge mer de f/lace, of which the outlets and overflow are the com-
paratively small glaciers on the coast, though in reality, compared with the glacier-
system of the Alps, they are of gigantic size. The outskirtiug land is to all
intents and purposes merely a circlet of islands of greater or less extent. There
are in all probability no mountains in the interior, only a high plateau from which
the unbroken ice is shed on either side to the east and west, the greatest slope
being towards the west. This " inland ice " was increasing, as necessarily it must,
and would most likely eventually overlie the country as it once had in former

periods of the earth's history. He considered that Greenland might be crossed

from side to side with dog or other sledges, provided the party started under
experieuced guidance, and sufficiently early in the year before the snow was
melted off the ice. Whether they could return without assistance on the other

side was, however, a matter of doubt. No fjords now stretched across within the
explored limits of West Greenland. If they did, it was north of Smith's Sound,

where perhaps Greenland ended in an archipelago of broken islands. Little doubt
existed but that in former times one or more fjords stretched across the country, but

these are now permanently closed by the spread of the " inland ice,"

   It stated that the two expeditions sent by the German nation in the year 18G8
and 1869 to endeavour to add to the geographical and general scientitic know-

ledge of the Arctic regions were equipped entirely by private contributions, and

the honour of starting and forwarding the whole scheme belonged to the eminent

geographer Dr. Petermann, of Gotha. Tlie object and aim of the second expedi-

tion was the scientific examination and discoveiy of the Arctic central region

contained within the 75th parallel of north latitude, taking the coast of East

--Greenland as a basis. The aim involved two problems: (1) The solution of the

Greenland, and those countries, islands, and seas connected with it, and extending

in a northerly direction towards Behring's Straits, a measurement of a meridional

arc in East Greenland, excursions on the glaciers of the interior of continental

Greenland, &c. The two vessels engaged in the expedition were the ' Germania,'

145 tons. Captain Koldeway, and seventeen men, and the ' Hansa,' 100 tons larger,

Captain Ilegemann, vdth a crew of twelve. The expedition sailed from Bremer-

haven on the 15th of June, 1809, and after a tedious voyage of five weeks up to the

parallel of 75°, the vessels were separated in a dense fog. The ' Germania

reached Sabine Island on the 5th of August, and four days were spent in survey-

ing the neighbouring country, observing an eclipse of the sun on the 7th, deter-

mining the magnetic constants, &c. On the 10th they proceeded northwards, but

their progress came to a dead stop on the 13th, in latitude 75° 31', or 23' fiu'ther

north than had been reached by Clavering and Sabine forty-six years before. At

this point the land-ice lay quite fast, and extended fully ten miles in a N.E.

direction from the nearest land, since called Cape BiJrgen ; while against its outer

edge the enormous fields of pack-ice were so heavily pressed as to render all pro-

gress impossible. Towards the N. and N.E. no water was visible; this was just

as Captain Clavering and Sir Edward Sabine found matters twenty-three miles

further to the south, and within a day of forty-six years before, and it was also

their lot to encounter the same obstacles in latitude 75^ 29' in the following sum-

mer. Captain Koldeway determined on returning to the Pendulum Islands, and

there to await in safety a change in the state of the ice. Tlie remainder of the

month of August and the beginning of September was spent in obtaining geolo-

gical, botanical, and ethnological specimens, and in making Aarious observations.

A sledge excursion, under Koldeway and Payer, into a fiord to the N.N.AV. of the

Pendulum group, from the 13th to the 22nd of September, resulted in a confirmation

of a previous supposition of the existence of a large island on that part of the

coast, and showed how much might be attempted in the exploration of the interior

Aof Greenland at this season of the year.                               second sledge excursion at the end of

October and begimiing of November was made by Payer and himself round the

north of Clavering Island, thereby proving its insularity', which had been suspected

by Clavering in 1823. On the 5th of November the sun disappeared for the winter,

but still they accomplished about 180 nautical miles in nine days, including the

penetration into a new fiord, whose termination they succeeded in reaching. From

the 12th of October to the beginning of May, while frozen in, observations were

made as to the temperature and pressure of the atmosphere, the direction and

velocity of tlie Aviiid, the amount of cloud, and the heiglit of the tide from hour to
hour. In making these and other observations the scientific members of the

expedition were zealously assisted by the two mates, Messrs. Sengstacke and

Traninitz, and the talented seaman Peter Ellinger, whose subsequent death at tho

early age of 24 has robbed nautical science of one of its most promising supporters.

January 1870 was the coldest month, with a mean of 11°'9 Fahr. below zero
and towards the end of February the thermometer reached its lowest, --40° -5 ; but

samples of pure mercury did not show any sign of freezing. The mean of the

+whole year was remarkably low, being cvly 11^'3 Fahrenheit. Magnetical and

astronomical observations were made from time to time. The magnetical con-

stants of their winter quarters in lat. 74° 32' 16" N., and 18° 49' W. long, were :

declination, 45' 8' 8"; inclination, 79° 48'; and horizontal force 0'956 Gauss's

scale *. The northern lights were not in general particularly brilliant, but were

extremely frequent, and the convergence of the streamers was found to coincide

with the direction of the freely suspended magnetic needle. The spectroscopic

examination of the auroral light fixed the place of the green line at 1245 of Erch-

hofl's scale. The main direction which the labours of the expedition took during

the spring was the prosecution of a sledge journey to the north under the leader-

ship of the Captain, who was accompanied by Payer and six seamen. An advance

was made of 150 miles in a straight line from his winter quarters, and added at

Aleast one whole degree to our maps of the coast of East Greenland.  week after-

wards Payer conducted another party towards the fiords to the north-west of the

Pendulum Islands, and they succeeded in bringing back a magnificent collection of

fossils and minerals. At the same time Dr. Biirgen and himself were engaged in

the measurement of an arc of the meridian, commenced in the beginning of March,

by measuring a base of rather more than 709 metres in length on Sabine Island. On

the 14th of May, Ur. Copeland and his companions started on their geodetical tour

towards the north, intending to select and signalize their stations as they advanced

northwards. All the angles at sixteen out of seventeen selected stations were

measured, and the latitude of tho north end, as deduced from eighty-two circum-

meridian altitudes of the sun, was 75° 11' 30"-12, with a probable eiTor of 0"-78
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

that of the south end, 74° 32' 15"-86, probable error O'o8. The highest station

was 10084 metres above the level of the sea. They took advantage of the oppor-

tunity thus afforded for comparing altitudes determined with the barometers with

those deduced from purely trigonometrical operations. The whole of the barome-

trical heights were slightly in excess of the trigonometrical ones. Their geodetical

labours were very much restricted and eniban-assed by the setting in of the thaw

as earh" as the 3rd of June. The ship was freed from her winter prison on the

11th of July, but they did not sail till the 22nd. So far as examined, the botanical
and zoological collections had yielded no absolutely new varieties, but had taught

much about the distribution of plants and animals. Perhaps the most important
discovery in that department was that of the musk ox, which animal was found

plentifully up to the 77th parallel. With regard to natives, although the whole

coast from the 76th parallel to the innermost recesses of Emperor Francis-Joseph's

Fiord, in lat. 73 deg., abounded in vestiges of the aboriginal inhabitants, and although
Clavering fell in with a party of twelve on the south side of the island which was

now known by his name, this expedition never even met with recent traces of
their presence. However, they succeeded in finding eleven skulls, and many

interesting weapons and utensils. Being again stopped by the ice in 75° 29', it

was decided in full conclave to try their fortunes in some of the fiords supposed to

exist towards the south. They accordingly proceeded southwards along the coast

until they rounded Hudson's Ilold-with-IIope, and proceeded to explore the inte-

Arior of the supposed Mackenzie Inlet.  single day, however, served to show

that no such inlet existed, and thus that what had been called Bennet Island, was
only a hilly promontoiy. Payer and himself afterwards resolved to ascend Cape
Franklin, and from its summit saw about sixteen new islands, and upwards of 170
icebergs of from 100 to 200 feet in height. 'Towards the S.W., at a distance of

--60 nautical miles, lay a chain of moimtains of 6000 or 7000 feet high most pro-

bably the "Werner Mountains of Scoresby. About eleven o'clock they started for
the 'western or higher end of Cape Franklin, whose height they assumed to be
4000 or 4500 feet. There they found that the bay or fiord bent round towards
the N.AV., sending branches in a westerly direction, while to the north it seemed
to expand into magnificent proportions. It was resolved to take the ship round
into the hitherto imvisited waters. On the north shore of the entrance, the green
slopes which formed tlie foregroimd of the rugged heights of Cape Franklin were
dotted with the small, burrow-like, forsaken winter dwellings of the inhabitants,

whom some strange mutation of the climate had driven away, and afforded pas-

ture to numerous herds of reindeer. From this point they steamed about 90 milea

into the interior of Greenland ; and had not the defective state of their boiler and
the positive character of their instructions prevented them from risking a deten-

tion during a second vrinter, they might have easily advanced much further.
From the summit of a peak (Mount Payer) 7200 feet in height, situated in 2(P 18'

west long., a view wa.s obtained of a mountain-chain lying about one third of the
breadth of Greenland from the east coast, the loftiest' peak of which must have

been nearly 13,000 feet in height. No traces of a complete glaciation of the inte-

rior were visible. The usual magnetical, astronomical, zoological, and botanical
excureions were here made. On the 17th of August, the expedition left the coast,
and arrived at Bremerhaven on the 11th of September, 1870. During the whole
voyage they determined the density of the sea-water, which was found to increase
with the depth, especially amongst the ice. In regard to the ' Hansa,' from which
they had been parted, notwithstanding the heroic efforts of her captain to reach
the coast, she was nipped in the ice, and went down on the 23rd of October, 1869,
leaving her crew to make an almost miraculous voyage of 800 miles on a con-
stantly decreasing ice-floe, exposed to all the rigours of an Arctic winter. They

wei-e fortimately able, after at length leaving the ice-raft in their boats, to reach
Friedrichsthal with the most incredible exertions.

The lower course of the Limpopo was explored a few vears ago by Mr. St. Vin-

cent Erskine, the son of the Colonial Secretary of Xatal ;' and Capt.'Elton's object

was to trace its higher waters, in order to see whether a more convenient route

and water communication could be opened up from the settlement on the Tati

river to the sea-coast, a distance of nearly 1000 miles. The difficulties, both

natural and artificial, with which Capt. Elton had to contend were often very

great                            but  the  physical  obstacles to his  journey, and  the    hostility or  cupidity of
                              ;

the natives, were successfully overcome; and lie accomplished a'vovage of con-

siderably over 000 miles. lie has also shown, as he believes, the practicabilitv of

the route he has opened up, and it is scarcely too much to expect that by so doing

he has rendered essential service to commerce and civilization.

 This                            instrument  consists  of  a  pair of  circular  disk-like  re.?eiToirs  about  2^  in.  in

_

diameter and f in. in depth, made of iron, at the same casting : one contains the

mercury, and the other is the trough for observing.

The disks are connected at their circumferenc^es by a narrow neck, in which is

drilled a hole to allow the mercuiy to pass from one reservoir to the other; the

communication between the two reservoirs is opened or closed by a stopcock, on

the cone principle, so that the mercury can be passed from one disk to the other

without removing the glass cover or th'e risk of losing any of the mercury. There
are two screw .stoppers attached to the mercurial reservoir for admitting air into

that reservoir or out of it as required. The trough-disk is fitted with, a glass
cover, which is screwed on when the mercury is to he passed to or from the other

reservoir. When an observation has to be made this cover is removed, and a disk

of glass is placed on the mercury ; this gives a clear and steady reflecting surface.
The weight of the instrument is 1 j lb. The instrument is made by Messrs. Gould
and Porter, successors to Gary, optician, No. 181 Strand, London.

Further disclosures of the Moabite Stone. By Dr. Ginsbttbg,

Ascent of the Atlas Range. By Dr. J. D. Hooker, C.B., F.B.S.

   In this paper the author described his ascent of the Greater Atlas, accompanied

by Mr. Ball and Mr. G. Maw. Permission was given him to visit the whole range
of the Atlas from a point eastward of the city, westward to the ocean ; but he was

obliged to promise to confine himself to collecting plants for the Royal Gardens
and to practising as a Hakim, so that he was imable to take any exact topogra-
phical observations. He, however, reached the crest of the main range visible
from the city of Marocco, which has long had the repute of being the loftiest of
the whole great Atlas range. The mountains present, as seen from Marocco city,
a long ridge, apparently of tolerably uniform height throughout its whole length,
about 1.3,000 feet, steep and rocky in the upper regions, with long streaks of snow
descending in deep steep guUeys ; but it otters no snow-capped peaks or slopes
of any extent, nor glaciers, and the loftiest points of the jagged sky-line are not
snowed at all. The party took, from Marocco, first a south-easterly course to the

foot of the Atlas, in the province of Misfuia, and thence a south-westerly one to
the province of Keraia, whence they had been assured that the crest of the range
was accessible. Their camp, at an elevation of 4400 feet, was surrounded by olive
and walnut groves, fig-trees, prickly pears, vines, mulbemes, and almonds. The
native trees were poplar, ash, juniper, willow, and callitris (the famous Thuja of the
Romans) ; the bushes are lentisks, honeysuckle, cistus, elder, rose, alatemus, philly-
rtea, ivy, bramble, and shrubs allied to the broom. The climate is temperate, and
the scenery rather pretty than g^'and or mountainous, except up the valleys, which

are backed by the rugged, black, but snow-streaked crest of the range. At 6000
feet the party came upon the first indubitable signs of old glacial action, in a huge
moraine projecting apparently from the flank of a lateral valley, with two smaller

moraines nearly parallel with the greater one. All were loaded vnth. enormous

blocks of porphjTy and other metamoi-phic rocks, and, except for the walnuts and

little terraced fields, are nearly bare of vegetation. At about 9000 feet thej' came
upon a mule-track, up which they piished over rocks and debris. Dr. Hooker and

Mr. Ball were botanizing, and Mr. Maw alone reached the crest, where he read

his aneroid, which ga-\e a height, by comparison with another aneroid and the
boiling-point, of 12,000 feet. The temperature was 24"^ F. The most remarkable
feature of this part of the range is the downward extent of the snow in steep deep
northern gulleys to 7000 or 8000 feet, i;p to the end of May; but these snow-
streaks are not connected with any snow -fields or snow-capped peaks above. This

seems to be due to the climate and to the steep contour of the axis, which is now
scorched by a blazing sun, now swept by dry Sahara winds, and throughout the
year exposed to the very prevalent N.W. oceanic wind laden with vapours that

fall as snow and hail-storms. There is thus probably always snow on this part of

the Atlas, but there is no perpetual snow proper ; in other words, all the snow that
falls annualli/ on fairly exposed surfaces melts in the same year. Botanically, the
upper region is as bare as the middle region is rich, and the author described in
some detail the characteristics of each. The Atlas has a special interest as pi'e-
senting the southern limit of the Mediterranean, and indeed of the North Tempe-

rate flora.

The party proceeded from the beautiful valley of Reraia westward over the

northern spurs of the Atlas to the province of Sectana, whence they travelled on

Wadto that of Amsniiz. crossing the  en Fys, the principal feeder of the Temsift,

where the author and Mr. Ball ascended a peak 11,000 feet high in the main range,

and from thence saw across the Sus valley to the southward. The snowj' axi^
here approaches to within some fifteen miles of the foot of the mountains, and
consists of more isolated tops and far less steep ridges, though snow came down

to 8000 feet on northern exposm-es. The floor of the valley, like the otliers, is
very narrow, and clothed with walnut and olive cultivation, threaded by a
Wadbrawlino- stream. The valleys of the upper feeders of the  en Fys occu}3y

an area^probably not less than twenty miles broad. Dr. Hooker saw no forest in

anv part of the range, clumps of brushwood and isolated stumps of oak, juniper,
carob and ash being all that remain of the primaeval woods. These mountains are
extremely bare ; even moss and lichens are poor and rare compared with what other
alpine and subalpine regions present. Low as is the latitude of Marocco, its vege-

tation shows that the North Atlantic detennines its climate, favouring the dis-

persion of northern types up to the tops of the Atlas, and forbidding the entrance
of southern forms that elsewhere prevail in similar latitudes. From Amsmiz the

party continued to travel along the base of the Atlas, and made some minor

ascents, obtaining a general idea of the character of the chain in this longitude

--(8° W.), where there is another broad depression, through which the road runs

from Marocco to Tarodaut in the Sus valley a place once of immense commercial

importance, and still one of great resort. The party returned to Mogadore on the

3rd of June, and succeeded in bringing their collections safely with them, which

will enable Dr. Hooker to elucidate the flora of a hitherto almost unknown region.

The Moors and Arabs of Marocco are described as being vile beyond a proverb.

The Government is despotic, cruel, and wrong-headed in every sense. From the

Sultan to the lowest soldier all are paid by squeezing those in their power. Ma-

rocco itself is more than half ruinous, and its prisons are loaded. The popidation

of the whole country is diminishing ; and what Avith droughts, locusts, and cho-

lera, and prohibitory" edicts of the most arbitrary description, the interior is on the

brink of ruin. But that two thirds of the kingdom is independent of the Sidtan's

authority, being held by able mountain chiefs who defy his power to tax or inter-

fere with them, and that the European merchants maintain the coast trade, and

the Consuls keep the Sultan's emissaries in check, Marocco would present a scene

of the wildest disorder.

     Nule on ihe Geograpliical Distribution of Petroleum ctncl allied products.

                By Colonel R. Maclagan, ll.E., F.R.8.E., F.B.G.S.

   The extent and variety of the uses to which petroleum and other allied pro-
ducts have come to be applied, and the vast quantities in which, within the last
few years, thej- have been obtained, give a special interest and importance to the
observation of their geographical range and positions. The places are numerous,
and the circumstances varied, in which these substances, in some one or other of
their forms, have for long ages been Icnown.

   The classification of these products having certain general common characters,
and probably a similar origin, is not now essentially different from tliat of Liunreus,
and exhibits relationships before recognized in a less formal and systematic way by
Pliny and others *. They belong to LiuniBus's class of "inflammable minerals,"

consisting, according to his arrangement, of bitumens, coals, amber, and amber-
gris. Tlie bitumens he specifies as fluid bitumen or n.aphtha, rock-oil or petro-
leum, mineral tar or maltha, mineral pitch or nuimia, asphalt, mineral tallow,

elastic bitumen, and hard bitumen or jet. And next to the bitumens and coals
he places honey-stone (found associated with asphalt), common amber, and amber-

gris. Prof. Archer, in a paper on the oil-wells of Pennsylvania and Canada (Art

Soc. Journ. Aug. 1864), saj'S, " It may he useful to know that rock-oil, petroleum,

Biirbadocs tar, naphtlia; are all varieties of the same material, and that bitumen

is the pitch-like residue wlucli remains after the refined oil is distilled from the

crude, or has naturally dried away." These are the substances of which collec-

tively the geographical positions are to be noticed.

The notices in old writers of the well-known sources of bitumen on the Euphrates

and in Judaja are numerous, and these are the most frequent subjects of reference

to these products in later times, till the remarkable naphtha-springs at Bakii on

the Caspian, and the striking appearance which they present, came to be more

generally known. The soft bitumen in the Euphrates valley is that of which we

have the earliest mention *. The word translated " slime " in the English version

of Gen. xi. 3, is cicripaXTos in the LXX. and bitumen in the Vulgate, and this is

wliat is meant. Of the asphalt of the Dead Sea, its quantity, and the magnitude

of the masses frequently found, there are many accounts in the writings of ancient

and modern travellers t.
   The great abundance of the petroleum at Bakii on the Caspian, and the remark-

able sight presented by the Haming streams of oil and discharges of gas, have been

the subject of many descriptions. One of the chief things of note at Bakii is this

emission of inflammable gas or naphtha-vapour, which occurs also in many other

parts of the world, with or without the immediate accompaniment of oil-springs.

The fire-temple at Bakii has a special interest in connexion with India, not only

from its general similarit}' to that of Jwala-Miikhi near Kangra in the Punjab,

but also from the circumstance that the Baku temple has, for a long time and

down to the present day, been, like the other, a place of Hindoo pilgrimage, and

maintains a small fraternity of resident Brahmans. The great conflagrations of oil
on the surface of the gi'ound have not been constant, and many travellers do not
mention them ; but they could not fail to have been mentioned by any who had

seen them J.
   Marco Polo describes the great abundance of the discharges of oil at Baku, and

says that people came from vast distances to fetch it§. Bakii is described by

Kaempfer, who was there in January 1684 ||. Just a hundred years later it was
visited by Mr. Forster on his journey from India to England. He has given a

detailed and interesting account of the place, and of the Hindoo mendicants and

merchants who resided there. He mentions that tlie Hindoo traders there were

chiefly from Mooltan, and that they usually embarked at Tatta in Lower Sind,

proceeding by sea to Bussora, and thence accompanying the caravans passing into

Persia. I made endeavour to ascertain at Mooltan whether there is at the present

day any direct intercourse between the Hindoos of that place and Bakii, but could

not learn that it is kept up. But it is very possible that enterprising Iliudoos

from Mooltan who do not return there, and whose movements are not known to
Atlieir friends, may settle down at Bakii as they do elsewhere.
                                                                 Punjabee Hindoo

died a few years ago at Moscow, regarding whose property in Russia and relations

in the Punjab there was some correspondence between the Russian Government

and our own in India and in Eugland. Among the Hindoos at the Bakii temple

Forster ^ found an old man, a native of Delhi, who had visited all the celebrated
temples of northern and southern India, and whom he afterwards met at Astracan.

Morier, in 1812, met in Persia a Hindoo entirely alone, returning to Benares from

a pilgrimage to Bakii **.

   About midway between Kaempfer's time and Forster's, came Jonas Han way, who

gives a description of Bakii, the fire-temple, and the Hindoos, and the great quan-

titles of oil, olDtained then cliiefly from certain islands in the Caspian. Descriptions
are given by other old and modern travellers of this oil-region, the copious discharges
of the white and black naphtha, the streams of flaming oil on the liill sides, the
gas and the fire-temple, and the explosive effects of the ignition of the gas mixed

with atmospheric air*. An interesting communication was made in 1808 to the

Geographical Society of Paris by Dr. Boerklimd on the results of his trans-
Caucasian explorations, in which he describes the naphtha-regions of the Caspian.

On the lie Sacree, he mentions, not far from the Abscheron peninsula on which
stands Bakii, there is now a manufactory of paratfine.

    Dr. Boerklund notices also the association of these petroleum-fields with active

mud-volcanoes. The connexion of petrolemn with eruptions of mud and agita-

tions of the earth's surface is noteworthy and important t- The most complete
 observations on mud-volcanoes, and the relation of these and similar phenomena
 to deposits of petroleum, are to be found in Prof. Ansted's paper on the subject

 communicated to the Royal Institution in May 186G, with immediate reference to
 the mud-volcanoes of Sicily and the Crimea which he had recently visited. There

 are mud-volcanoes in other parts of the world, in connexion with which petroleum
 has not hitherto been found. There are large volcanoes of this kind at Hiuglaj
 near the south coast of Belochistan, which have been visited by a few British

 officers. So far as I am aware, no signs of petroleum have been found in their

 neighbourhood ; but the country has not been well explored J. The petroleum of
 Kerman has been noticed by Pottiuger§. One of the allied substances, ambergris,

 has long been a noted product of the adjacent seas.

    The similarity of the jihenomena shown by mud-volcanoea and gas-spriugs in

 the Italian peninsula, in the Caucasus, and iu South America, is displayed over
 great tracts of country in the Chinese Empire ||. The use of the natural fires of

 petroleum and gas in the province of Shan-Si is described in an old account of the

 province by a native writer, Dionysius Kao, who says that in all parts of the pro-

 vince are fierj^ weUs, which conveniently serve the people for cooking their victuals.
 (Possibly the " Temple of the Limit oJ Fire," mentioned by Fa Hian the Chinese

 Buddhist pilgrim, was a temple over natural gas-flames like those of Bakii and

 Jwala-Mukhi^.) Similar gas-flames on the Caramanian coast are described by

  Capt. Beaufort **, as before by Plinj-.

     The country from which the principal supplies of petroleum were obtained in
  Britain, previous to the discovery of the enormous quantities to be obtained in
 America by boring, was Burmah. Of the petroleum wells in that comitry a full

  account is given in Colonel Yule's ' Narrative of the Mission to the Court of Ava,'
  and in the notes in the Appendix by Mr. Oldham, Director of the Geological

  Survey of India. In the Province of Pegu there is a burning hillock called the
 Nat Mee or Spirit Fire, of which an account is given by Lieut. Duil) Deputy
  Commissioner of Thyct Myo, in a communication to the Asiatic Society of Bengal,
  July 1861. The gaseous exhalations at Chittagong, called the Burning Fountains

  of Brahma, have been described bj' Turner, and more recently by a writer in the

  Journal of the Asiatic Societ}- of Bengal ft.

     There are many other parts of Asia and Europe iu which these products, in
  some of their forms, are found and liave long been known. In Assam petroleum
  is now obtained in considerable quantity by boring. The native petroleums of
  Southern India and of Australia have been shown in recent local exliibitions.

and used since au early period *, is now being worked. The chief purpose for

which it is directly requu-ed is the manufacture of gas for one of our large military

stations (Rawid-Pindee).

   The great vigour and vitality of the flame of petroleum gave it a special value as

a material for igneous missiles before the invention of gunpftwder. It is only

necessary here to notice this application of the mineral oils as indicative of the

localities from which the material was probably obtained f. The Levant, the
coast of Asia Minor, the Grecian islands, bicily, and the Caspian, would furnish

abundance of this material in some of its fomis for the destructive engines and

fire-balls used in the Eastern wars and sieges. There is good reason to believe

that the Punjab petroleum was applied to a similar purpose by Mahmiid, of Ghazni,

in one of his engagements near the Indus with the Indian prince Anandpal in the

beginning of the 11th century. This question has been discussed in a most inter-

esting note ou the early use of gunpowder in India by the late Sir Henry Elliot,

in the fii-st volume of his ' Bibliographical Index to the Mohammedan Historians

of India' J.

   The substance called nuimia, or miimiai, is held in great estimation as a medi-

cine for both internal and external use. The other substances of the same class

are also used for medicinal as well as for other purposes § ; but what is called
niiimia is used for this only. The cun-ent belief in the East is that nuimia is of

animal origin. It is worthy of note that recent researches have led to the con-

clusion that this is the case with respect to some, at least, of the great deposits

of the mineral oils discovered within late years ; but the animal origin of nuimia
is, in Persia and India, believed to be more immediate. That obtained in the

shops at Lahore is said to come from Cabid, that is, in a general way it is ob-

tained from or through Afghanistan. Dr. Fryer tells of a place in Persia where it

was obtained in his time {|. Petroleum is abundant in the same quarter now.

Another of the substances of this class, ambergris, has at all times been believed

to belong, mediately or immediatelj^, to some big animal of the salt water ; but

the conclusions regarding it are not even now very satisfactory ^.

The geographical positions in which these various products in some of their

forms are foimd, and in wliich indications of their existence, or the frequent ac-

companiments of them, are met with, appear to be sufficiently varied. They occur

in great river-basins, in those of the Euphrates, the Indus and its tributaries, the

Brahmaputra, the Irawadi ; of the St. Lawrence in Upper and Lower Canada, the

Ohio and Mississippi in the States of Ohio, Tennessee, and Arkansas, the Rio

Colorado and other minor rivers in California and New Mexico. Next, we observe

them very abundant in the two remarkable depressed lakes, the Caspian and the

Dead Sea. In islands, Ceylon, Sicily, Zante, and other of the Greek islands, in

Sumatra, and in a special manner in Trinidad near the mouths of the Orinoco.

   The frequent association of these products with salt has been noticed. The oil-
fields of the Punjali, which have lately been surveyed and reported on, are all in
the north-west part of the broken series of hills and tract of country bearing the
ii-eneral name of the Salt Range, containing the inexhaustible stores of massive
salt fi-om which that province and neighbouring countries have been supplied for
many centuries. The explanation of the connexion of salt with petroleum has yet
to be sought, but the fact meanwhile is important.

   The oil is not always accompanied with gas, but the inflammable gas appears
o-enerallv, if not always, to indicate the existence of the oil in some form, and par-

ticularly, as it appears, in regions producing salt.

   The oil is obtained, as in Burmah, by making excavations in the soil in which
it has become dittused, into which excavations or wells the oil slowly passes from

the soil around. And it is procured by deep borings, in which it may rise in the
manner of water in artesian wells, by hydrostatic pressure, or, as in the many
instances with whicli descriptions of American and otlier oil-wells have made us

familiar, forced up from reservoirs in subterranean cavities under the pressure of

steam or other vapour. In any geographical situation it may be obtained in the
first manner. It is when it occurs along the outskirts of mountain-ranges that it
may rise as in artesian water-wells ; and wliere the earth lias been subjected to
violent internal action, and the rocks have been much split and displaced, it is

obtained from cavities and veins, frequently attended with escape of gas at the
surface of the ground and spontaneous discharges of the oil.

   These appear to be, in a general way, tlie lands of situation and the modes in
which, where these products liave been formed, they are obtained for use, or
where the surface-indications of their presence occur. It is desirable that further
and more definite information shoidd be gathered by those whose experience uf oil-
regions, or other opportimities, atlbrd them the means of contributing to our know-
ledge of a subject which has come to be of great practical importance as well as of
scientific and general interest.

                        By C. E. ITaekhajt, C.B., See. R.G.S.

   The author began by referring to the paper which he read before the Association
at the Leeds Meeting in 1858, and in whicli he showed the vast importance of the
opening up of lines of water communication between the Andes and the Atlantic
by way of the Amazons, and the iuiinense extent of country which then remained
to be explored. Having pointed out what h:is since been done in the wav of dis-

covery, he proceeded to give an account of the recent investigations connected
with that portion of the mighty eastern Cordillera of the Andes which contains
the som'ces of streams that form the Beni, and to report upon the operations
which are in contemplation, with a view to opening a navigable route from the

Beni to the Atlantic by way of the river Madeira. The old Yncas of Peru did
all that was possible to secure for their people the wealth of those interminable
forests to the eastward of the Andes, but they did not know that the rivers dash-
ing down from their mountains led to an ocean whence the arts and products of
the whole world might be brought to their doors. But their descendants see, in.
the mighty Amazon and her tributaries, a means of saving the ruinous land-car-
riage of their merchandize to the Pacific coast. The cost of taking a ton of mer-
chandize from Cuzco, the capital of the Yncas, or from La Paz, the commercial
capital of Bolivia, to England, is about £40, the time five months. Under such
conditions no produce but gold, silver, and chinchoua bark would pay tlic expense

of transit. By the route of the Madeira and Amazons, this voyage of fi^e months

Avill be reduced to six -sveeks, the course being through a civilized empire which

takes the lead in opening the way for the commerce of the Avorld ; while the

opening of those great iluvial highways will also have the effect of solving the

most interesting questions in South American geogTaphy. The section of the

Eastern Andes, which is drained by the feeders of the Beni, extends from the

parallel of Cuzco to that of La Paz. This eastern chain forms a giant wall, run-

ning up into the loftiest peaks of South America in its southern portion, and

everpvhere rising above the line of perpetual snow. The author showed that the

cartography of the south-eastern end of the chain is well defined in our best

modern maps, while that of the north-western portion is in a state of much con-

fusion                           and  he also pointed out some  analogous features which                                exist  between the
                              ;

Andean and the Himalayan ranges. He then described in some detail the phy-

sical features of the region, which is pecidiarly interesting, leading to the conclu-

sion that the complete examination of the great affluent of the Madeira will result

in opening up one of the richest countries in the world, provided that the question

of turning the rapids of the Madeira, and of making the lower part of its course

navigable, is grappled with and overcome. The Brazilian Government is alive to

the importance of developing the resources and fostering the trade of the Amazon

valley, and has caused an elaborate survey to be made of the Madeira rapids.

These are eighteen in number, the total fall being 272 feet. The length of the

river course, containing rapids, is 229 miles, and the length of actual broken water

is 12 miles. The difference between low water and Hoods is about 20 feet, the

rise commencing in October and ending in March. Commerce is now carried past

in launches and canoes carrying from 3 to 8 tons. At six out of eighteen rapids it

is necessary to haul the boats round overland, at five others the boats are hauled

up stream while the boats are carried round, and tlie rest are merely difficult passes

where the loaded craft easily .shoot along the current. Serious steps have now

Abeen taken to overcome these obstacles.                        concession has been granted for the

construction of a railway round the rapids, which will be 170 miles long, including

a short branch to the mouth of the Beni. Above the Madeira rapids there are

3000 miles of river suited to steam navigation ; and the articles of commerce, which

would at once find an outlet by this route, are Chinchona bark. India-rubber,

vaniUa, sarsaparilla, balsams, aloes, valerian, dye-woods, gums, wax, hammocks

and bats, cacas, coffee, hides and tallow, wool, skins, cotton, gold, silver, and copper.

Connnerce is already treading close on the heels of             discovery                                               and Peruvian  l)ark,
                                                                                                                     ;

hitherto shipped exclusively from Pacific ports, is now beginning to find its way

to England by the Amazon and Parp. The trade of the Amazons, which was less

than half a million when the steamers began to run in 18o3, is now upwards of

£2,000,000 ; and this only represents the traffic on the main stream. The increase
will certainly be enornious when the mighty affluents bring down the products

of the Andes to find their way, by this magnificent fluvial highway, to the At-

lantic. The country is one possessing boundless capabilities, and a bright future

must assuredly be in store for that great Amazonian basin which nature has ble.ssed

so wonderfully. Nothing can be more likely to conduce to the consummation of

its commercial greatness than the thorough examination of those splendid navigable

rivers which form the chief affluents of the Amazons, and some of the more^Km-

portant of which are still so little known. In no other part of the world is there

a grander field for geographical discovery and research. In no other part will the

labours of the explorer be more richly repaid.

  On the GeograjyJiical Positions of the Tribes ivJiich formed the Empire of the
              Yncas. By Clements R. Makkham, C.B., Sec.Ii.G.S.

   In submitting to the Section the A-iews which a study of early writers, the
native languages, and the topography of the country had led him to form respect-
ing the geographical positions of the tribes which combined to form the empire of
the Yncas of Peru, the author pointed out that the study of the nature and degree
of the civilization attained by the aboriginal Americans is especially important,
because that civilization was £elf-developed. The three i\merican empires of the
 186 EEPORT-- 1871.

 Yncas, the Cliibchas, and the Aztecs were based upon the progress made in the
  arts of civilization by the tribes which composed them, and on the united efforts of
 those tribes, after they had been welded into great nations. The difficulties of
 classifv'ing or distinguishing the special characteristics of the component tribes
 having been shown, a description was given of the region which formed the empire
 of the Yncas. This vast tract is a long strip of mountain- and coast-line, bounded
 on the east by the forest-covered plains of the Amazonian basin, on the west by
 the Pacific Ocean, and extending north and south from 2° N. to about 20° S., or
 upwards of loOO miles, with an a^'erage width of 400 miles. It comprises every
 variety of climate, and contains within its limits the most prolific tropical forests,

 valleys -with the climate of Italy, a coast-region resembling Sind or Egypt, tem-
 perate hill-sides and plateaux, bleak and chilling pasture-lands, and lofty peaks and

 ridges within the limits of eternal snow. On one mountain-side the eye may

 embrace, at a single glance, sugar-cane and bananas under cultivation in the lowest
 zone, waving fields of maize a little higher up, shaded by tall trees, orchards of
 tropical fruits, stretches of wheat and barley, steep slopes clothed with potatoes
 and quiuoa, bleak pastures where llamas and alpacas are browsing, and rocky pin-
 nacles streaked with snow. In such a country, with such a variety of climates
 and products, and where communication is so difficult, the various nations appear
 to have gradually developed their capabilities in almost complete isolation. The
 tribal divisions of the empire of the Yncas agree well with its leading physical
 aspects. They consist of hve clearly defined regions, four following the lines of
 the Cordilleras, and the fifth on the sea-coast. The first and most northern extends
 from the river Ancas-mayu to the knot of Loxa, a distance of 350 miles, and is

included in the kingdom of Quitu. The second reaches from the mountain-mass
 of Loxa to the saddle which separates the drainage of the Huallaga and Ucayali.
It is 450 miles long, and comprises the Y'nca division of Chinchasuj^u. The third
 and most important region is that which is drained by affluents of the Ucayali. It
includes the home of the imperial tribe, and may appropriately be called the Y^nca
division. The fourth comprises the basin of Lake liticaca, and is known as the
Collao. The fifth is the coast-region, and extends along the shores of tiie I'acific,
from the Bay of Guayaquil to the desert of Atacama, a distance of 1200 miles.
There is no sufficient evidence for the belief that the Yncas originally came from a
distance, and there is a native tradition to the effect that their civilization was
altogether of indigenous origin and growth. The author referred successively, and
in considerable detail, to the religion, the language, and the architecture of the
Y^ncas, which afforded evidence of, and an index to, the progi-ess of civilization

among the tribes. He also briefly described the different regions which comprised

the empire, and gave some account of their history and peculiar characteristics.
The conclusion arrived at, after careful study, was that the tribes of Peru resolve
themselves into two primary divisions, distinguished by a complete difference of
language, both as regards vocabulary and grammatical construction, sufficient to
establish an entirely separate origin. These are the people of the four Andean
regions, and the Indians of the coast. They form two races and two civilizations.
The tribes of the four Andean regions, on the other hand, spoke languages which,
though difl'eriug as regards vocabidary, are identical in grammatical construction,

aud^oint to a common origin. The languages are our most reliable guides. Phy-

sical differences are caused by local circumstances connected with climate and
habits of life. But the languages, when carefully studied, give us an insight into
the original condition of the different tribes, and, with the aid of evidence collected
from the earliest writers, enable us to resolve the great Y'nca Empire into its
elements, and to classify its component parts. In a geographical point of view it
ii important that we should be able to indicate the exact positions occupied by the
diilerent tribes, as well as their relative importance, and the degree of relationship
they bore to each other.

      On the Inundation and Subsidence of the Yang-tsze River, in Ghiiui.

                                      By S. MossMAN.

   The author described the phenomena attending the annual floods of the Yang-
tsze-Kiang, which are similar to those of the Nile, but greater in inundation, and
more devastating in eflect. The floods depend upon rainfall from clouds caused by
the south-west monsoon rising in the Indian Ocean, and the melting of snow in
Eastern Thibet and Kokonoor, where the tablelands are from 12,000 to 13,000 feet
above the level of the sea. So far the origin of the floods in the Yangtsze-Iviang is
similar to that of the Nile, but the rise and subsidence of the former river are more
rapid than those of the latter. The inundations vary more or less in their htsight
from year to year, the range being from thirty-live to fifty feet, while the most fre-

quent rise is about forty feet.

              On the Geoyraphy of Moah. By E. H. Palmer, M.A.

   The author commenced by describing the country of Moab, which is about fifty
miles long by twenty broad, and includes the tableland on the eastern shore of the
Dead Sea, as well as that part of the Ghor which lies on the eastern bank of the
Jordan opposite Jericho. The uplands he described as consisting of a rolling pla-
teau, about 3200 feet above the level of the sea, the western edge being cut up
into deep valleys, and descending by a series of sloping hills, at angles of forty-five
and fifty degi-ees, into the Dead Sea. These uplands are naturally divided into

two districts by the great chasm of Wady Mojib, the Arnon of Scripture. The

author gave some interesting instances of his identification of moderu places and
terms with those mentioned in Scriptui-e historj'. For instance, he stated that the
modern town of Kerek, though little better than a collection of hovels, stands upon

--the site of the ancient capital of Moab. In the Old Testament it is called Kir-

Ilaraseth, Haresh, or Ileres. The first part of the name appears to signify "a

walled city," but the meaning of the suffix has sufliciently puzzled commentators.

But when the author was at Dhiban (the ancient Dibou), he unexpectedly met

with an explanation of this term, and it is very curious as an example of the stri-
king manner in which apparently trivial local idioms and customs often illustrate

the phraseology of the Bible. Asking one of the Arabs where the Moabite stone
was found, the latter replied that it was " between the harithein," that is, between
the two hariths. Now, in Arabic this word would mean a ploughman, and when
the author asked for a further explanation, the Arab pointed out the two hillocks
upon which the ruined village of Dhiban stands, and between them lay the frao--

ments of the broken monument of Meslia. Nearly all the towns in Moab are built

upon similar eminences, and the author found that they are invariablj- called
Hariths by the Arabs. The word " Harith" is precisely equivalent in orthography

to the haresh, or hareseth of the Bible ; and tlius, in an apparently insignificant

--idiom, is seen an imexpected illustration of the topography of the Bible, an addi-

tional reason for identifying the modern Kerek with the ancient Krr-hareseth (" the
city on the hill"), and the interesting discovery of a local Moabite word handed
down from the time of Jehoram, son of Ahab, to the present day. The author
gave several other curious instances of this kind of identification, and described at
some length the investigations of Capt. Warren, Mr. TjTwhjtt Drake, and himself.

188 KEPORT--1871.

On an Acoustic Phenomenon at Jebel Ncigus, in the Peninsula of Sinai,

                        By Captain H. S. Palmer, B.E.

   Jebel Nagus is the name given to a liigh sand-slope in tlie western coast-range
of the peninsula of Sinai, about five miles north of the port of Tor. The sand of
this slope possesses the peculiar property of giving forth loud musical sounds when

set in motion b}' design or by natural causes. According to a ciuaint native legend,

founded on the former monastic occupation of this part of the peninsula, the sounds

are said to proceed from the ndgus, or "wooden gong"*, of a monastery buried
beneath the sand. Hence the application of the name Nagus to the slope in

question.

   The sand-slope is about 200 feet high, and 80 yards wide at its base, narrowing
towards the top ; it faces west-south-west. Sandstone cliffs overhang it, and bound
it on either side, and an open sandy plain stretches from the foot of the slope to the
sea-shore, about three-quarters of a mile distant. The sand of the slope appears to
be that from the neighbouring desert plain, derived in the first place from the
waste of the sandstone rocks, and then conveyed to its position on the hill-side by
the drifting action of high winds ; its grains are large, and consist entirely of
quartz. The rock in situ is a soft friable quartzose sandstone, of a pale brown
inside, and weathered externally to a dull dark brown. The sand of the slope
is so clean, and in its usual condition so extremely dry, and inclined at so steep
an angle (about 29^") to the horizon, that it may be easily set in motion by such
causes as the passage of men or animals across it, falling debris from the clifls
above, or disturbance by the wind. Sometimes also movement on a smaller scale
may arise from an abnormal excess of heat and drought, or from the separation
of the surface-particles, after their consolidation by rain or dew, on the return of

heat and the sun's burning rays. When any considerable quantity of tlie sand is

in movement, rolling gradually down over the surface of the slope in thin waves
an inch or two deep, just as oil or any thick liquid might roll over an inclined

sheet of glass, and in similar festoons or curves, then is heard the singular acoustic

phenomenon from which the hill derives its name, at first a deep, swelling, vibratory
moan, rising gradually to a dull roar, loud enough, when at its lieight, to be almost

startling, and then as gradually dying away, till the sand ceases to roll. Tlie

sound is difficult to describe exactly ; it is not metallic, not like that of a bell, nor
yet that of a itdf/us. Perhaps the very hoarsest note of an yEolian harp, or tlie
sound produced by drawing the finger round the wet rim of a deep-toned finger-
glass, most closely resembles it, though there is less music in the sound of the

rolling sand : it may .also be likened to the noise produced b^^ air rushing into tlie
mouth of an empty metal flask ; sometimes it almost approaches to tlie roar of very

distant thunder, and sometimes it resembles the deeper notes of a violoncello, or the

hum of a humming-top. The author found by experiment that hot surface-sand was

more sonorous than the cooler layers beneath ; it also seemed to run more quickly
the first experiments on any one part of the slope produced louder effects than
subsequent ones. Surface-sand, at a temperature of 103° Falir., exposed to tlie

sun's full glare, produced the grandest effect observed, while sand in shade, at G2^,

was almost mute. By day the heat on the slide is generally very great. Move-

ment of the sand when moist is not accompanied by unusual sounds. Excavation

was impossible,  on account of  the continuous flow of the sand when disturbed                                                                                                                                                                                                                        in
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

some places nothing solid could be reached by probing; in others, rock was felt a

few inches below the surface, but whether (';; situ or not could not be ascertained.

When sand is rolling down and producing sound, there is a distinct vibration on

the slide, increasing with the intensity of the sounds. Throughout Capt. Palmer's

stay, the wind blew from N.W. ; the effects produced on the slide by winds from

other quarters have yet to be observed. Experiments on two other sand-slides, a

little to the south of Jebel Nagiis, and resembling it in many particulars, did not

had bettei- maans and opportunities for investigation than those of previom travel-
lers, aud he submitted this paper in the hope of once more inviting attention to a
curious and interesting subject. There could be no doubt that the sound arises
from the movement of the surface-sand, and is intimately connected with the sili-
ceous character of the sand and its extreme dryness, but the author was not aware
that any exact explanation of the phenomenon had as yet been elicited from
scientific men.

       On Trade Boutes hctween Burmah and China. By Major Sladeit.

   The author explained that the object in view in all explorations undertaken in
Burmah had been a desire on the part of our Government and mercantile classes
to ascertain the practicability of establishing an overland route from the Bay of
Bengal to Central and South-Western China. Major Sladen referred to the expe-
dition which he conducted up the Irawadi a few years ago, and pointed out

the practicability of navigating this river nearly, if not quite, up to the Chinese
frontier. At Blianio, 900 miles from the sea, and probably 1000 miles from its
source, the Irawadi, when full between its natural banks, is four miles in breadth,
and during a third of the year or more it might be navigated with the greatest
ease as far as Bhamo, by vessels as large as any that have ever ascended the

Yangtsze, from Shanghai to Hankow. By selecting the Irawadi as a means of

transit for produce from South-Western China, and Rangoon as a port of export
for such produce, the voyage to Europe, both in distance and duration, would be
reduced in a correspoding degree, the expenses of navigation would be reduced, the
risks and dangers attending difficult navigation through the straits of jMalacca aud
the China seas avoided, and the heavy insurances at present in force by reason of
siich difficult navigation would be altogether done away with.

               On the Proposed Skiiy-Canal between Ceylon and India.

                          By Commander A. Duxdas Tatloe.

   This officer, having given much attention to the study of Indian hydrography,
devoted a portion of his paper to an historical sketch of the discussion which has
been going on more or less during the whole of the present century regarding the
practicability of forming a navigable passage between the Gulf of Menaar and the
Bay of Bengal. The project of deepening the Paumben Passage for the naviga-
tion of large ships did not commend itself to Commander Taylor's approval. Sir
James Elphinstone, as a practical seaman, had personally investigated this channel,
but had come to the conclusion that it would never do for large ships. But during
his examination of the neighbourhood in concert with Captain Dorman, Master-
Attendant of Colombo, Sir James discovered a well-sheltered area of anchorage,

with soundings of five or six fathoms, extending over five square miles, and thence
190 KEPOUT-- 1871,

gradually decreasing to four fathoms about half a mile from tlie Indian shore,
where the canal's mouth is proposed to be. This harbour lies between Mostapetta
Point and Moosel islet, lengthwaj's on the plan ; whilst its north and south limits

are respectively at Poonamudum town and Moolee islet, the entrance, in which there
is now a depth of three fathoms at high water, being about a mile and a half to the
east of the last-named islet. The anchorage is well protected against the southerly
swell of the monsoon by the coral islets and connecting reefs, extending from Vali-
nookani Point to Rameswaram.

  By Colonel Henry Yule, C.B., President.

In this paper the author described the progress of the French Expedition up the

Camboja river, which was sanctioned in the end of 1805 by M. Chasseloup-

Laubat, then ISIinister of Marine, and also President of the Geographical Society of

Paris. The object of this Expedition was to discover the nature and resources of

the region in whicli the French had planted a colony, and also to extend French

influence in that direction. But few Europeans had previously ascen4ed the

river, so that the Expedition had practically a virgin field for exploration. The

party started from Saigon on the 5th of June, 1866, and included Capt. De laGrtSe,

the chief, Lieut. Garnier, second in command and geographer, Thorel and Joubert,

nav}^ surgeons and naturalists, Delaporte, a young naval officer, as artist, and

De Carn6, a young civilian. There were also four European soldiers and sailors,

but they were all eventually sent back, and natives employed in their stead. Pro-

ceeding first to the neighourhood of Udong, near the Great Lake, as it is called,

they then directed their course to Cratieh in 12° 28', distant 300 miles from the

mouth of the river. Here they took to canoes for the ascent, which was at first

favourable, but was afterwards rendered difficult by rapids and cataracts, the river

being also broken by a vast number of islands. Above the cataracts the channel

became nan-ower, and the islands gradually ceased. Difficulties with regard to

passports were also felt, and a variety of causes rendered travelling backwards and

forwards several times imperative. Instruments also that were necessar}' to suc-

cess, and that had been promised them, had not arrived, and now, to add to their

troubles, an insurrection broke out which closed the river below. Lieut. Garnier

volunteered to make his way by land to the Delta, where it was expected that both

passports and instruments would be found. lie started on the 10th of Januarj',

1867, and, after a perilous journey, reached the French gunboat stationed on the

frontier. The passports were found, though the instruments were still missing ; and
on the 8tli of February Garnier once more started for the upper country. On the

lOtii of March he rejoined his party at a place called Huten, in the pro-vince of

Khemarat, having travelled something like 1100 miles since quitting them. This

fatiguing j ourney has added a large and Ijefore quite unexplored tract to the surveys

resulting from the Expedition. On quitting Huten, the river turns more and more

westward and forms the first immense elbow, hitherto quite unsuspected (running

east and west for nearly 4° of longitude), in about the latitude of 180° north. As

far as Vienchang, the country traversed by the river is an immense plain, rarely

Abroken by a few mountain-ridges.  short distance above Vienchang, the Mekong

is found definitively shut in between two ranges of hills, and instead of its breadth

being measured by miles, it is contained in a channel of ·'300 or 600 yards wide.

Having got on the borders of the Ava territory, the party found that their most

serious difficulties commenced. The Burmese officials offered obstructions, and the

rainy season added severely to the fatigues of the way, while the extortions of the

natives caused them additional trouble. But at last they reached Kiang Hung,
                                                                       TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                    191

where new effoi-ts were made to stop their farther advance. In October, however,

they were enabled to start once more for Tsemas, the first stage in China, that

country to which they had so long looked forward as the Promised Land. The

Mekong was here finally quitted. The Expedition had to deviate eastward, and

came upon the Yuen Kiang, or River of Tonking. Gamier explored this river as

far as the Anamite frontier, and rejoined his party at Linggan. From Linngan-fu the

Expedition proceeded direct towards Yimnan-fu, traversing a lake-region of great

interest. On quitting the valley of the Tonking river they commenced ascending

a plateau of 5000 to 5600 feet in height, on which they found growing most of the

fruits and other vegetable products of Europe. They arrived at Yunnan-fu on the

23rd of December, 1867. Thence they set off by a devious course (tlie country

between being ravaged by hostile armies) for Tali ; but Capt. De la Gree falling

sick, the leadership of the expedition was given to Lieut. Gamier, Dr. Joubert

being left in charge of the chief. Through a difficult country, by the aid of some

missionaries, the party at length reached Tali, but were soon compelled to leave

again owing to the Sultan's unfriendliness. By consummate generalship and great

presence of mind Lieut. Gamier conducted his party once more across the frontier,

where rumours of the death of their chief reached them, causing them intense

anxiety. At length a letter from Dr. Joubert confirmed the rumours, and plunged

them all into the deepest distress. Finally, in May 1868, they embarked on the

great Kiang at Sin-chan-fu, and reached Hankau in the beginning of June, just

two years from their departure from Saigon. Here they found once more country-

men of their own, a European settlement, and means of transport to carry them back

to their native land. The whole distance over which they travelled between Cratieh,

at the head of the Mekong Delta, and Sinchan on the Upper Yangtse, amounted

to 2400 miles, of which about 1650 were performed on foot. To this must be

added about 2000 more in excursions and digressions by separate members of the

Expedition                                                        and  they have  surveyed  an  extent  of  actual  itinerary of  over  4000

            ECONOMIC SCIENCE AND STATISTICS.

     Address hy Lord Neates, one of the Lords of Session, Pi-esident of the

                                                                     Section.

A T>iSTiNGiTisHEB predecessor in the occupancy of this chair commenced its busi-

ness by declaring it to have been the custom that the proceedings of the Section
should be opened by an address, and that that address should be a brief one. In
complying with the first of these rules, I shall endeavour, if I can, not to forget the

second ; but the subjects falling within the jurisdiction of the Section are extensive,

and compression is always difficult, particularly to one who like myself am rather
a novice in the matters of which I am to treat.

  Economic science is sometimes spoken of as having a very modem date ; but I

think that this is an error. More or less the subject has entered into all the codes
or systems of law that have been established from the earliest times. Alongside
of political philosophy, which may be considered as peculiarly the science of
Government, great attention has always been bestowed upon matters which form

--an important part of political econom}', or economic science such as taxation, trade,

commerce, wealth, and population. Those writers also who have presented us

with ideal or imaginary States, or Utopias, are full of discussions and speculations
of the same kind. The rival 'Republics' of Plato and Aristotle afford abimdant
illustrations of this statement. It is peculiarly interesting to see this fact brought
out so vividly in the admirable introduction to the ' Republic ' of I'lato, prefixed
to that treatise in Professor Jowett's translation of that great philosopher ; and if
·we had a similar translation and exposition of Aristotle's kindred work, which I

think we might have from the hand of one of our own Vice-presidents, to whom
                                                               ;

we owe so excellent an exposition of the " Ethics," we should see in a remarlcable

manner how many of the most interesting questions of the present day were con-
sidered and dealt with hy those two wonderful men according to the varying lights
and tendencies which characterized their several minds. It is true that in more
recent times a great advance has been made in economic science, and one feature
and excellency of that change is the tendency to leave things as much as possible

to their spontaneous operation, and to the inherent laws of nature and society

thouo-h here again there has latterly been a reaction. It is to the credit of Scotland

--that she has produced the two greatest leaders in this modern movement David
--Hume and Adam Smith who are still high authorities on the whole subject, and

whose principles have been made the basis of much of our recent legislation.

   The subject of Statistics is added to the title of this Section as an auxiliary to

the main subject of economic science.

Statistics and their Fallacies.

The study of statistics, though not entirely of modern origin, has assumed a

special prominence in recent times. Statistics are certainly more of the nature of

a means than an end, and their great use and object I take to be to establish, by

showing the proportions or averages of results as they actually occur, the existence

of certain natural laws possessing the character of absolute or general uuiformitj'.

But statistics are liable to hazards, which it is most important to attend to and
guard against. It is a common jest that there is nothing so fallacious as figures,

except facts ; and, as generally happens, this jocular reproach has enough of partial

truth in it to preserve it in vitality. Two qualities of mind are employed in statistics

--of very difterent kinds namely, accuracy in observing and recording facts, and

wisdom in deducing inferences "from them. These two difterent faculties must act

in harmony together; and if they do not do so, fallacious conclusions will inevi-
tably be the result. Let me give some easy and familiar instances of the fallacies

that may thus be caused.

  lu the course of my duties as a judge of the Supreme Criminal Court, I have occa-

sion from time to time to find at circuit towns very light or even altogether empty

calendars ; and when there is no case to try at all, this is naturally a matter of

rejoicing for all concerned, of which the judge has the double benefit in having

nothing to do, and in carrying oft' a pair of white gloves. Latterly, however, I

have been led in such cases to make the remark to the local authorities, tliat a

--light calendar was not an unequivocal sign of a satisfactory state of things in a

district, for that result might arise in two ways either from no crime being com-

mitted in the locality, which is a just subject of congratulation, or from few or no

crimes being detected and brought to justice, though many may have been com-
mitted, which is a very deplorable condition of ailairs. Tliis consideration, I am

glad to say, was not called forth by any thing in the state of our criminal police in

Scotland, "but was suggested and illustrated by the condition of matters in another

part of the United Kingdom, where there was no want of crime, but it often led

to no prosecutions, from the inability of the law to lay hold of the perpetrators, or

to find evidence to prove their guilt. Xay, a deeper fallacy may sometimes lurk

under judicial statistics of this kind. It has been said, I fear with truth, that in

certain parts of the kingdom the very absence of some delinquencies of a special

description is the result of a complete subversion of legal authority. Agi'arian

crimes are perpetrated there in order to punish or deter those who exercise their
legal rights as to land ; and when this system of ten-orism is complete, the crimes

cease to be committed, because the evil organization has attained its object, and

does not need to be practically exercised, as no one dares to disoljey its lawless

mandates. The reign of terror is thus established by paralyzing the exercise of any
Afreedom of action which might incur its penal denunciations.
                                                               worse state of

society than this can scarcely be imagined, where lawlessness is enthroned and

wholly supersedes the law.

   Another example of fallacious inference from judicial statistics may be derived

from the history of our penal legislation. Until the middle or latter half of last

century, the proprietary feelings of the country, and specially, perhaps, of the urban

trading classes, incited Parliament to pass severe law^s for their protection, which
                                                                                  --

often affixed to slij^ht violations of property a capital punishment. The number

not only of robberies but of tliefts, which were tlien capitally punishable, is almost

incredible to us of the present generation ; and can now excite only our horror and

amazement. I -vrould refer you hei'e to an admirable paper on tliis subject by

Johnson, being No. 114 of the ' Rambler/ which gives an account of the feelings

that then prevailed and the system that was followed. The paper, which is most

powerfully written, deserves peculiar praise, as being the commencement of those

humane and wise eftbrts for the amelioration of the penal law that were afterwards

renewed and brought to a successful issue by the perseverance of Romilly and the

--practical sagacity of Peel. Dr. Johnson says : " It has always been the practice,

when any particular species of robbery becomes prevalent and common, to endeavour

its suppression by capital denunciation. Thus one generation of malefactors is

commonly cut ofij and their successors are frightened into new expedients. The

art of thieviug is augmented with greater variety of fraud, and subtlised to higher

degrees of dexterity and more occult methods of conveyance. The law then renews

the pursuit in the heat of anger, and overtakes the oftender again with death. By

this practice, capital inflictions are multiplied, and crimes, very different in their

degrees of enormit}-, are equally subjected to the severest pimishment that man has

the power of exercising upon man."

Now, in this state of things, there is little doubt that after every new application

of capital pimishment to a crime that did not previously infer it, there might be

a diminution of prosecutions on that head, and the public were thus, perhaps, led

to think that theft and rapine had in this way received a check. But experience

--and reflection soon suggested another explanation, which is thus pointed out in the

paper I refer to: "All laws against wickedness are ineffectual unless some will

inform and some will prosecute ; but till we mitigate the penalties for mere viola-
tions of property, information will always be hated and prosecution dreaded. The

heart of a good man cannot but recoil at the thought of punishing a slight injury

with death, especially wlicn he remembers that the thief might have procured

safety by another crime from which he was restrained only by his remaining virtue."

In connexion with this last consideration, Dr. Johnson had previously urged that

the terror of death "should be reserved as the last resort of authority, as the

strongest and most operative of prohibitory sanctions, and placed before the treasure

of life to guard from invasion what cannot be restored. To equal robbery with

murder, is to reduce murder to robbery, to confound in common minds the grada-

tions of iniquity, and incite the commission of a greater crime to prevent the de-

tection of a less. If only murder were punished by death, very few robbers would

stain their hands with blood ; but when by the last act of cruelty no new danger
is incurred, and greater security may be obtained, upon what principle shall we bid
them forbear? " This remarkable paper, written, be it observed, in the year 1751,

--concludes with the following characteristic sentences : " This scheme of invigora-

ting the laws by relaxation, and extirpating wickedness by lenity, is so remote from

common pi-actice, that I might reasonably fear to expose it to the public, could it

mybe supported only by  own observations. I shall therefore, by ascribing it to

the author, Sir Thomas More, endeavour to procure it that attention which I wish

Wealways paid to prudence, to justice, and to mercy."  may thus see how mere

numerical statistics in such questions may speak an ambiguous language, and that

the paucitv of prosecutions may be a proof, not of the wisdom, but of the incfficacy

of our legislation ; for while it is doubtful how far criminals, or at least habitual

criminals, are deterred by capital puuishraent, which they come to look upon as the

fortune of war, there is no doubt that undue severity disinclines injured parties

from taking steps to bring down on the delinquent what is considered as an exor-

bitant penalty. I may here, perhaps, suggest a question whether our country of

Scotland was" not saved fi-om such evils partly by the institution of a public prose-

cutor, and partly by the anomalous, but convenient power which he possessed of

restricting the pains of law, when they were capital, to an arbitrary punishment

a resource which was likely to render juries less unwilling to convict than they

might otherwise have been. I should mention that a protest against the severity

of the penal laws as to property was uttered by an earlier opponent of the system,

though one not so disinterested as Dr. Johnson : I mean the widovv^ of the freebooter

Gilderoy, or wlioeA'er it was that wrote the Lament hearing that name. The verse
I refer to runs thus, and is expressed in rery good " braid Scots " and very fair

metre :

                " Wae worth the loons that made the laws
                     To hang a man for gear

                    To reave of life for sic a cause

                       As stealing horse or mear !

                    Had not their laws been made sae strick
                      I ne'er had lost my joy

                    Wi' sorrow ne'er had wat my cheek
                      Por my dear Gilderoy."

There is another matter of a different kind on which the language of statistics

is also <ambiguous. The relations of the sexes constitute a most important branch

of economical science, and in no point is information of more value than where it

Werefers to female purity or to the circumstances affecting marriage.  have now

generally in our registers a good enumeration of the legitimate and illegitimate

births that occur among us, but I wish to point out some of the hazards or uncer-

tainties by which these are surrounded. In Scotland, as a whole, there is ira-

doubtedly a considerable proportion of births that are illegitimate ; but the propor-

tion varies much in different localities. Ten per cent, is not by any means the

Ahighest proportion ; but let us suppose two districts, and B, where the proportion

is much smaller, say 5 per cent, in each. "What does this indicate? It may pro-

ceed from a greater degree of moral purity, as fewer examples of unman-ied cohabi-

tation will, of course, diminish the number of illegitimate births. But the small

proportion of those births may possibly be produced by a totally opposite cause

for it is equally certain that extreme licentiousness of morals, and especially any

professional profligacy among women, has a tendency to diminish the number of

children born. So that district A, with a small percentage of illegitimate births,

may be a very moral district, and district B, with the same small percentage, may

be full of prostitutes and other dissolute women, who, from that very character,

seldom or never give birth to children at all.

I mention these fallacies in statistical studies, not with the view of discrediting the

science, but in order to show the necessity of looking below the surface, and of pausing

in our deductions till we are sure that we have all the necessary materials forjudging.

The subject I have just touched upon is intimately connected with the habits of

a population as to the contracting of raan-iage. Early marriages have necessarily

a tendency to check illicit intercourse, and are often encouraged with that view.

The Catholic clergy are supposed to recommend, if not to enforce, such marriages

with a view to the moral purity of their flocks. But it ought to be remembered

that the remedy involves other evils of its o-wn ; and it may be suggested that, if

female chastity can oulj' be preserved by the marriage of young persons when little

better than children, this is not a very high tribute to the prevalence of good prin-

ciples, nor a result that is a just subject of pride. I suspect, indeed, that other

ecclesiastical bodies besides the Catholics have the same tendency to encourage
Aearly mai-riages.
                    Presbyterian minister in Ulster told me that in the first

marriage which he celebrated in his congregation, the united ages of the parties

were under 30, and he baptized a child for them a year afterwards. No groat good

can come of a system such as that, particularly if it be accompanied, as it often is

in Ireland, -with a further subdivision of the ipatemal farm for the support of the
Ayoung couple.
                healthy opinion in a people to discourage early marriages, and

at the same time to enforce good moral conduct, is a manifest cause of prosperity;

and it is said to explain in a great degree the thriving condition of the NorAvegian
peasantry. But artificial restraints on marriage, without a high standard of

morals, do no good. In Bavaria, it seems, from local and partial interests, various

legal checks arc imposed upon marriages. But, as has been said, " they do not

care to check concubinage ; and thus the number of illegitimate births in Munich

is nearly as large as that of legitimate."

Registers in Scotland to be, g-enerally speaking, in a most satisfactory state, parti-

cularly in tlio important department of Vital statistics, as to which the reports of

tlie Registrar-General, embodying the reports made to him by Dr. Stark, contain

reliable information of the most interesting and important kind. One singular

residt that seems to have been established by the tables there given is, that at

every quinquennial period of life, from 20 years of age up to 85, married men die in

Scotland at a much lower rate than unmarried men. Sometimes the difference is

very great, particularly between 20 and 45, up to which period it approximates to

as high a rate as 2 to 1 ; but after that, the difference, though less, is still very

considerably in favour of the married men. The subject is more complicated as

regards women, from obvious causes                                                                                                                                                                        though here, too,  marriage  seems  to  be  the

more favoured state. As regards both sexes, the advantage on the side of marriage

is easily accounted for up to a certain point. Generallj^ speaking, those who many

are likely as a class to be better lives than those who do not. The unmarried will

infalliblj' include a greater number of sickly or diseased constitutions than the

man-ied class. Without professing myself an implicit believer in Darwin, I acknow-

ledge the truth of several of his statements in his 'Descent of Man,' as to what

he calls Sexual selection. As a general rule, the attachments that lead to marriage

will be prompted by considerations that are intimately connected with health and

strength. Good looks, cheerful tempers, and buoyant constitutions are great

attractions, and those who are wholly devoid of these, as well as those who are the

victims of positive bad health, will often be excluded from having tickets in the

matrimonial lottery. No doubt causes occur not mifrequently which disturb these

natural tendencies. Some of these causes are allowable or laudable, others are the

reverse. In a few cases affection leading to marriage may be inspired by great

virtue, or gTeat talent, or liigh accomplishments, though not associated with health

or strength. In other cases, connexions maybe formed that are wholly unconnected

--with love as where rank, or wealth, or influence may overcome the natural repug-

nance excited by deformity or disease. Bm-ns, I thiulc it is, that says

                    " Be a lassie ne'er .sae black,
                          If she hae the penny siller,

                      Set her upon Tintoek tap

                         The -wind will blaw a man till her."

Still, as a general rule, both men and women who are married are likely, on an

average, to have more health and vitality than those who remain single. As

regards the male sex, again, those of them that are of dissolute habits or unsettled

and thriftless dispositions, are not so likely to marry as those who are orderly and

well-conducted, and in favourable circumstances of life. But after making allow-

ance for these elements, it still appears that the death-rate of married men is at all

periods of life lower than that of the unmarried. This can be accounted for only

on the footing that man'iage is favourable to health, by conducing to regular habits

of life, and by aiving natural scope to the domestic affections. It caimot be doubted,

for instance, that an old man who has a wife to take care of him, will be much

better looked after than if he lived alone. It is not necessary in adopting this view

to suppose that the married life is to be wholly free from sorrows, cares, and

anxieties. Even these are not always prejudicial to health ; and we are, perhaps,
the better for them when they are well encountered. Neither is it essential that

the matrimonial cuiTent should always run a smooth course. Most of us, probably,

would agree with the view taken by Paley, who, when an old clergj-man at an

episcopal dinner asserted that he had been married for forty years, but had never

had a difference with his wife, observed quietly to the bishop that "it mtist have

Anbeen very flat."  occasional ripple will occur in all water, unless it be frozen

over, and perhaps after marriage, as well as before it, there may be truth in the

maxim, "Amantium irre amoris redintegratio."

In referring to this matter it has occurred to me to consider whether, if the lower

death-rate of married persons is an ascertained fact, this maj' not partly account fof

the general success of Life insttrance offices when well conducted. It is clear that

an office transacting on the usual calculations of mortality, has advantages of variov.g

kinds. In particular, its medical examinations, which are a most important part

In general, of course, it is impossible to derive any good result from statistical
Afacts or apparent coincidences except by comparison.

nected with Scotland was summoned before a Committee of the House of Lords to

give evidence in connexion with the new Divorce court proposed for England, and

was asked whether, in his opinion, the facility of divorce existing in Scotland was

unfavourable to the morality of man-ied persons there. The judicious answer was,

"I have not sufficient experience of the comparative morality of married persons in

different countries to be able to give an opinion on that question."

                                    Matters not yet Reduced to Statistics.

   The subjects to which statistics may be extended seem to be innumerable, and
new ones are cropping up every day. In the pages of ' Nature ' tliero lately ap-
peared a letter of a somewhat curious kind, which may perhaps engage the attention
of our fellow-associate member Mr. Tyler. The suggestion in that letter was that

the degree of civilization existing in any country is connected with the quantity of
Soap there consumed. The writer gave as a formula the equation of

X being the amount of civilization inquired for, S being the soap consumed, and P

the population consuming it ; so that the amount of civilization depended on the

proportion of S, the numerator, to P, the denominator. If S is large in proportion

Howto P, then the civilization is great, and vice versa.                                                         the civilization of Scotland

in the olden time would come out according to this test I shall not inquire ; but if

tliere is any truth in the proposition, it gives additional relevancy and interest to

the question which is sometimes vulgarly put by some people to their friends as to

how they are provided with that commoditj'. I have not yet seen any tables

framed upon this principle, but I have no doubt that the Registrar-General will

keep it in view.

  An inquiry of a more serious nature, and indeed peculiarly important and impres-

sive, is connected with one of the most remarkable phenomena in human nature

I mean the occasional appearance in the world of men of great genius. From time

to time men have arisen whose mental powers have far transcended the ordinary

standard of human intellect, and who have thereby been enabled within the space

of a single life, and by the eflbrt of a single mind, to give an impulse to science and

discovery wliicli they could not have received through long generations of average

mediocrity. Whetlier this singular boon and blessing to maukind can be traced to

any law is a natural but mysterious inquiry. Some persons have considered the

production of exceptional genius as quite an insulated fact; and Savage Landor

declared that no great man had ever a great son, unless Philip and Alexander of

Macedon constituted an exception. Mr. Galton, however, in his interesting work

on ' Hereditary Genius,' lias endeavoured to prove that genius runs in families, or,

at least, that men of genius have generallj' sprung from a stock where great mental

power  is  conspicuous                                                          and  he  adheres  to  the  view  commonly taken  as to  the
                                                                             ;

importance of the maternal character and influence in the formation of genius. I

do not venture to give any opinion upon Mr. Galton 's theory, but his book contains

an important collection of facts beaiing on the subject, and a great deal of curious

collateral speculation. Mr. Galton attributes gi'eat power in many ways to the

Heprinciple of Jiercditi/, as it seems now to be called.                                                         does not, indeed, go so far

as the Irish statist, wlio, as mentioned by Sidney Smith, announced it as a fiict

tliat steriUty was often hereditary; but he states that comparative infertility is

transmitted in families ; and adduces as a remarkable example, a fact not generally
known, if it be a fact, that in the case, that frequently happens, of Peers marrying

heiresses, the family is apt to die out very soon, the heiress being naturally, in the

general case, an only child, and bequeathing to her descendants a tendency to pro-
                                                                                               --

diice small families, which do not afford the usual chance of a numerous supply of

descendants. Whatever may be said of some of his other opinions, I hesitate to

concur with Mr. Galton in his proposition, that as it is easy " to obtain by careful

selection a breed of dogs or horses, g;ifted with peculiar powers of runnni"- or of

doing anything- else, so it would be quite practicable to produce a highly gifted

race of men by judicious marriages during several consecutive generations." I

doubt greatly the practicability of such a plan; and suspect there are some

elements in human nature that would counteract it. Persons of proud family

descent have often a horror of mesalliances; but I scarcely think it would be

possible to inspire people of genius with the same esprit de corps or desire to wed

with those on a par with their own eminence. Men of genius do not seem to me
apt to fall in love with women as clever as themselves, and I rather suspect the

tendency is to look for some difference of character, an instinct of which it is the

object, or at least the result, to keep up the average of talent rather tluin to multiply

the highest forms of mental power. At any rate we may here ask poor Polly's

question                                           " Can love  be  controlled  by  advice ? "  and  however  Ave  may  in  other

whether a high mental stature could be maintained by coupling male and female

genius together, or whether the experiment might not fail as signally as it is said

sometimes to have done with Frederic William's attempts to breed grenadiers. I

strenuously advise, however, that a marriage with a fool of either sex should be

always considered as a mesalliance, and I would particularly warn the ladies against

such a step, taken sometimes, it is said, in the hope that their sway may in that
Away be more easily maintained.
                                                                               fool is as difficult to be governed as a mule,

and the couplet, I believe, is strictly true, that says

                                                   " Wise men alone, who long for quiet lives,
                                                    Wise men alone are governed by their wives."

                                                                   Economic Laws.

   Leaving the multifarious field of Statistics, and reverting to our leading subject

of Economic science, or which may seem a synonymous term, Political economy', it

embraces specially the study of those natural laws which have reference to the
Wealth of nations. This is perhaps its proper character as a science ; but when
those laws are ascertained in their natural operation, practical questions arise of

great difficulty for the determination of any Government desirous of promoting, not

Howmerely the wealth, but the welfare of a nation.                                                  far in particular are those

laws to be left to their natural and spontaneous operation ? or, how far are they to

be modified either by limiting or by supplementing their operation ? For example,

freedom of trade and freedom of contract are, as a general rule, the best means of

promoting activity and prosperity in the departments with they are concerned.

JBut it can scarcely be maintained that this ideal freedom is never to be infringed.

I do not merely refer here to the protection which may be afforded to persons under
age in reference to their treatment, or to the manner in which they may be em-

ployed. In the eye of the law as well as of reason, a contract as to the employ-

ment or services of a person in nonage is in reality no contract at all. An infant
or minor cannot contract, and any contract that may be made in his name by any

guardian, or even by a parent, in every country where law is established, must be
Asubject to revision.
                                                               cruel or injurious contract as to a child's labour must bo

capable of correction and repression, j ust as any bodilj' outrage infiicted upon a man
would infer punishment and restraint. Even with persons of mature years the

general and better opinion seems to be that certain classes of the community require

to be protected by restrictions on the freedom of commerce or contract. Long ago

this system extensively prevailed, and very high and comprehensive ideas existed

as to the paternal duties thus incumbent on Government. Let us take two in-

stances of this kind, which may be placed, to some extent at least, in contrast with

each other.

   The history of the Usury laws is well known. Originating in a primitive idea
thfit interest upon money was unnatural, those laws kept up prohibitions againtt

the amount of interest that could be stipulated, with a professed view to the pro-

tection of needy borrowers against extortionate lenders. It was not till the year
--198 REPORT 1871.

1787 that there issued from the wilds of Russia a voice in defence of Usury, which
proved to all thinking- men tlie falsehood and folly of the existing system; but it
was still many years before the wise views of Bentham on this subject were carried

into practical effect.

                                       The Truck System.

Take, on the other hand, the case of what is called the Truck System. There

is nothino- in abstract reason to prevent master and servant, employer and work-

man, from agreeing-, if they please, that tlie remuneration shall consist partly in

the supply of food or fiirui^hiugs. Many contracts for work or service proceed

expressly upon that footing, and could scarcely be arranged on any other. But

the fraud or unfair proceedings to which the truck system so often leads, the op-

pressions and exactions often involved in it, the overwhelming power of the masters

or their managers in working- it, and the helpless condition to which it reduces

workmen and their families, are such that public opinion seems so powerfully di-

rected against it, that the laws for repressing it are more likely to be tightened

than relaxed. AVhether the workmen will ever be so free and independent as to

dispense with protection, or whether a healthy and high feeling of self-respect and

honour will prevail among masters, so as to place under ban those of their number

who  use  or  abuse     this  system,  are  matters of which I am incompetent to judge
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

but I fear that for a long time some restrictions will be maintained. The existing

condition of things is most unsatisfactory ; for the Act seems to be constantly

evaded, and all evasions of statutory regulations are morality, as well_ as economi-

cally, mischievous. The best remedy is, if possible, to diminish the improvidence

of workmen;, for, in most cases, if the workman has enough in hand to live with-

out advances before pay-day, he is practically independent of his master. Mariners,

I may add, seem by common consent to be always treated as children of a larger

growth, and protected accordingly. The criterion after all must always be the

majus honuin.

   The Truck system is a term commonly used to denote the arrangement by which,
directly or indirectly, workmen are compelled to take pajmient of their wages, or
of advances made to them on their wages, not in money, but in goods furnished
from the employers' stores or shops. J3ut the same name has been given to a sys-
tem that has long prevailed in Siietland, by which the dealings of many classes
(tenants, fishermen, and workers of different kinds) are carried on byway of barter,
with little or no use of money. This is a different sort of system from the ordi-

nary method of truck between master and servant ; and one which, in my humble

opinion, is still more difficult to deal with. The modus ojicrandi may be generally
imderstood by a few illustrations. The Shetland farmer is, in the ordinary case,

possessed of no capital, and seldom pays his rent in money. lie is unable pro-

bably to support himself bj^ any independent means ruitil his small crop is reaped,

or the produce of his farm ready to be realized. lie is consequently obliged to
seek assistance in the meantime by obtaining advances from some quarter or other.

He is also, as a general rule, a fisherman on his own account, but having no ciipital,

he is obliged to run in debt for his boat, or his share of a boat ; and again he is obliged

to resort to others to support himself and his family until the profits of his fishing
can be realized. The employment of fishing is notoriously a precarious one, and in-

troduces into his condition an element of chance and risk that operates powerfully to

affect his dealings. It is not easj^ for a party in such circumstances to obtain ad-

vances or furaishings where these can only be accorded to him upon doubtful credit
and at considerable hazard. The consequence has been tbat, for an immemorial
period, the Shetlander has been chronically a debtor to others, as fishermen com-

monly are, and not unnaturally the party with whom he has to deal has come to
be the proprietor of the land, or his factor or middleman. What might be done

by a good or generous creditor in such circumstances, I shall not attempt to con-
jecture ;. but generosity is not a mercantile virtue, and if a dealer tries to make his

own profit as great as possible, and still more if he is a greedy and unscrupuloiis
man, the poor Shetlander is in a bad way. The dealer has him greatly in his

power, both as to the quality and as to the nominal price of his goods; and no

doubt much injustice may be done in this way. Another feature comes frequently
into play. The females of the Shetlander's family occupy themselves in knitting
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS,  199

those delightful shawls and articles of hosiery -with which we are acquainted, and
these the women carry to certain dealers to dispose of; but here it is alleged, truly
or falsely, that, by ways and means, these workers are induced almost invariably to
take payment in goods consisting in great part of gay cotton prints, showy ribbons,

and other articles of female dress or hnery, not always well adapted either to their
position or to their humid climate. Another favourite commodity for which their
worsted work is exchanged is tea ; and it is well known that high-priced tea is the

great temptation which the Shetland women are unable to resist, tea-totalism in
Shetland being often as much of a vice as it is thought a virtue elsewhere. When
the dealers witli whom the family' has to do are all connected with the landlord or

the land, the case becomes extremely complicated, and a fiu-ther cause of mischief

arises, as the Shetlauder seldom or never has a lease, or will accept of one, and is

thus under the constant fear of being ejected if he thwarts the proprietor or his re-

presentative in any of his transactions. It thus happens that a Shetland family

--may be industrious in all its branches farming and fishing, and knitting to the

best of their ability, ,and yet will be constantly behind hand, dependent upon their
superior, and never perhaps handling a pound note from year's end to year's end.
The dealers, on the other hand, are said to make large profits, at least at times ; but

whether on the whole they are great gainers it is not easy to tell, as the state of

their transactions has never fully been brought to light. I am far from saying that

all, or even the majority, of the landowners are mixed up in these transactions
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

but the system is so well established that it is difficult to keep free of it. This is

certainly not a very good state of things. It has been said that the very boys when
they begin to work for wages get no money, bu.t are supplied with clothes, including

specially a coat to go to church in, and thus they get very early into the mer-

chant's books, so that perhaps it is not much of an exaggeration to say that a Shet-
lauder is under truck from his cradle to his coilin. Much clamour and complaint
have been excited by these pictm-es, and loud demands are made for stringent
and special legislation. It is quite right that fidl inquiry shoidd be made into the
facts ; but I confess I have little hope of seeing the evil cured by Act of Parlia-
ment. It would be preposterous to enact that no tenant who was starving shoidd

be assisted with advances except in money, or that no girl should exchange her
woollen manufacture for a cotton print ; ]ior, in like manner, would it be practicable
to say that a tenant should not pay his rent in cattle or in fish. The evil lies deeper
than this, viz., that the Shetlanders are trying to cany on the business of farming

and of fishing without the necessary means. If the steed has to wait for his food
till the grass grows he will probably starve ; and so will the farmer come to grief if
he has not something laid by to live upon between seed-time and harvest. It is
the possession or the want of the capital that makes the great difierence between

master and servant, farmer and labourer. The man who cannot wait till the

fruits of his labour or industiy are realized, ought naturall}' to be a servant, and
ought to receive wages or support independently of results ; but in so doing he
must forego the right to claim those profits which are to compensate for risk and

dela}'. If the farmer or fisher insists on going on on liis own account without any

--means and it is plain that the Shetlander's feelings or habits are adverse to his
--becoming a servant it is certain that he must become a borrower, and he will not

get aid from any lender without ample remuneration. That i-emuneration may be

 got either by charging high interest, or, as they do in Shetland, by making their
 advances in such a form and manner as will yield them a mercantile profit. This
 system has been so long established in Shetland, that the people are in a great
 degree reconciled to it, and its extirpation seems scarcely possible. I think that
 if I were a resident Shetland proprietor, I would rather let the system go on, but
 endeavour that it should be so administered as to do justice to both parties, in the
 hope that by degrees a spirit of independence and fair dealing might grow up. I

must say that I am very incredulous of any dealers getting, in this or in any other

 way, an exorbitant profit in the long run. For if that were the case, competition

 would be evoked, and one dealer would bid down or bid up the market till it

 reached a fair rate or return.

                                                                          Paujierisin.

to bring before us iu a precise shape the comparative principles and practical ope-

--rations of the poor laws in England, Scotland, and Ireland a subject undoubtedly

of great interest and importance. In connexion with the subject of pauperism, one

of the most important elements for consideration relates to private charity. It is

certain that an enormous sum of money is annuallj' distributed in that way through-

out the kingdom, and it is equally certain that the good done bears little propor-

tion to the amount given. It cannot be too much inculcated upon men's minds

that the givers of indiscriminate charity are practically to be classed among the

most mischievous enemies of the poor. The direct tendency of what they do is to

tempt and encourage the poor to become hypocrites and impostors, to paralyze their

industrj', and to undermine their self-respect and self-reliance. It is false to call
Asuch expenditure by the name of charity.
                                                great deal of it doubtless proceeds

from feelings of true benevolence ; but how much of it is prompted by other

motives ? The desire to do as others do, the wish to avoid the unpleasant sight

of distress, real or apparent, the inability to resist importunitj', the superstitious

idea that it is a duty to give a portion of our means in the name of alms, without

regard to the effect produced, just as the Pliarisees were scrupulous to pay tithes

down to the lowest article. Protestants are in the habit of reproaching Catholic^

with the importance they attach to mere good works ; but that fault is not con-

fined to Catholics, but is deeply seated in human nature. The false notion of ex-

piating sins, or of propitiating Divine favour by some self-sacrifice that is perhaps

Aeasily made, prevails in all sects.  story was current some time ago of a man

belonging to a very anti-Catholic sect, who had become rich by ver}' questionable

means, and who, when on his death-bed, asked his minister whether, if he gave

£10,000 to the church, it would improve his prospects in the other world. The

cautious and conciliatory answer was, that it "s^'as impossible to guarantee anj' such

matter, but that it seemed an experiment well worth trying. No such liberality,

whether in one's life-time or on death-bed, deserves tlie name of charity. There

can be no charity unless there is the desire to do good to the recipient ; and there

can be no enlightened charity that does not seek to carry out that wish in the ri^Lt

waj', by making careful inquiry as to the circumstances in which the boon is be-

stowed, and the effect which it is likely to have. It is not an easy task to accom-

Elish tbis object ; but I am glad to see that on all sides measures are being taken,

  y the help of associations and otherwise, to assist benevolent persons in wisely

--and intelligently carrying out their views. Two great considerations are here to

be looked to the real destitution of the parties to whom charity is given, and the

caution that confines it mainly to casual and extraordinary causes of distress, and
does not establish any resource on which the poor can rely, so as to dispense with

ordinary and necessary prudence on their part.

      On Sanltio-y Measures for Scottish Villages.
By Colouel Sir J. E. .Ilexandek, K.C'.L.S., F.E.S.E.

Within the last forty years there has been a gi-adual improvement iu many Scot-

tish villages, which by the absence of attention to the outward and visible sio-ns of

cleanliness, exhibited great carelessness in sanitarj^ measures. Manure-heaps are

still, no doubt, not far off from the cottages; but it is the business of the sanitarv

officers to see that they and pigsties are not close to doors or windows. Some of

our health oflicers are firm and do their duty, and insist on attention to sanitary

rides ; others again wink at irregularities, and favour particular parties to the in-

jury of their neighbours. There is still a vast amount of ignorance both as to the

necessity for pure air and water to insure good health to the community.

In visiting the cottages we still see occasionally that fever-chest called a " box-

bed," iu which at night a father, mother, and two or three children may bo
Wefound, with the air poisoned by their breath.

    On some Maxims of PoJitieal Economy as applied to the Emphyment of
          Women, and the Education of Girls. By Lydia E. Becker.

  In regard to employments common to both sexes by which persons gain a liveli-
hood, one rule is of almost universal application, that when men and women are
eunaTed in the same occupation, the remuneration of women is fixed at a lower
rate than that of men. In some cases this arises from actual superiority in men
as men for the work, in others from the superior advantages in training which are

arbitrarily given to men. In the Staflbrdshire potteries the higher and more ele-

gant branches of the trade, the modelling and painting, are given to men, while

women do the rough heavy work. In teaching, where the requirements from men
and women are equal, and the capacity of either sex for the work the same, wo-
men are paid only about two thirds the salarj' of men. It is said that, as a mat-
ter of fact, a schoolmistress can be had for less money than a schoolmaster, and

therefore the law of supply and demand, and the rules of political economy require

that she should receive less. But while this rule of political economy is alleged

as a reason for keeping down tlieir remuneration, women find that some other rule

than that of economic science is brought in to prevent them from having the benefit
of the law of supply and demand when that rule would tell in their favour. In

order to make it just that women should receive only the market price for their

services, there ought, on the other liaud, to be an open market for their labour

but women are not allowed to compete for the best paid educational posts. It is

arbitrarily assumed that they cannot teach boys, therefore in this country they are

shut out from the most profitable part of the teaching profession, although expe-

rience proves that women make excellent teachers of boys.
   Sometimes it is alleged as a reason for the inequality between men and women's

salaries, that it must be assumed that a man has a wife and family to maintain out

of his income, and this is usually not the case with a woman. But this reasoning

goes beyond the law of supply and demand. In calculating wages, the emploj'er
has no right to go bej'ond the consideration of the quality of the work demanded,
and the number of competitors for the post, in the question of what the recipient
of the wages means to do witli the money, nor to assume that he or she cannot

need such and such a sum. Women are arbitrarily shut out from many employ-

ments in which they are fully competent to engage. There has been an interposi-

tion on,the part of University authorities to hinder the supply of women doctors
to the demand of women patients. The rule of giving less to women than to men

is applied where it cannot be excused imder the plea of supply and demand. In
the table of conditions under whicli the Government grant assurance policies and

annuities, we find that a man and a woman of like age have to pay a like premium
for a life assurance policy, but that if a man and a woman of like age pay a like
sum for an immediate life annuity, the woman's annuity will be 7h per cent, less

than that of the man. The introduction of needlework as a compulsory subject in

o-irl's schools acts injuriously on the quality of education to be obtained in them.

Bovs are allowed to devote their whole school time to intellectual work, while girls

are" only allowed to exercise their intellectual faculties on the condition that they

shall devote a considerable portion of school time to manual labour. The gulf be-

tween the intellectual attainments of the sexes is already too wide, and the impulse
that is being given on all hand to the education of boys is making it wider every
dav. In order to accomplish the object of getting the whole people thoroughly
educated, the wisest and speediest method would be to bestow the principal sliare

of attention on that part which is confessedly behind, that of the feminine lialf of

the nation. When the standard oi education for women shall be brought up to the
--202 KEPORT 1871.

level of that for men, the education of both sections of the people will advance

faster than has hitherto been possible, and the combined intelligence of women and

men, educated and trained to a thougJitful appreciation of the truths mrfolded by a
study of both natural and economic science, will be able to arrive at a solution of
social and political problems which have hitherto baffled the wisest of our legislators.

                       On Land Tenure. By William Botly.

   The author introduced the subject by stating that "in treating the question lie
did so on principles at once tangible and practical," not on those of " The Land
Tenure Reform Association," but in such a manner as he believed would materially
tend to the interest of the three parties immediately concerned, and as a sequence

to the well-being of the country generally. He then gave an account of the many

and varied tenures by which land is liekl in Great Britain, France, Belgium,
Prussia, the Colonies, &c., deducing their relatis^e advantages and disadvantages.

He then gave a statistical account of the counties &c., proving that leases were the

exception not tlie rule : argued in favour of long leases (with few restrictions),
showing as a rule long leases and good farming go together, whilst with few ex-
ceptions yearly tenancy and insecurity led to bad farming gave a tabular state-

ment as to the relative yield of such estates. He also advocated Tenant Right to

the extent of compensation for all unexhausted improvements and beneficial out-
lays, instancing farms where such equitable agreements existed having trebled in

value and rental.
   After showing the beneficial effect on landlord, tenant, labourer, and the com-

monwealth, concluded by saying that physical, financial, and political benefits
would arise from the general adoption of long leases, with a well-considered tenant-

right clause inserted therein.

Educational Hospital Reform : The Scheme of the Edinlurr/7i. Merchant Com-

 pany. By Thomas J. Boyd, F.K.S.E., Master of the Merchant Company.

The scholastic institutions of the Edinburgh Merchant Companj' probably form

the largest system of schools in Great Britain, and are the only ones yet established

under the " Endowed Institutions (Scotland) Act."

The Merchant Company of Edinburgh was incorporated in 1681 by Royal Char-

ter from Charles II. It is in a highly prosperous condition, and upwards of 300

leading merchants, bankers, and traders, in Edinburgh and Leith, are members.

Since its institution, it has held a very prominent position in Scotland, and its de-

liberations and resolutions have not nnfrequently had considerable infiuence on

public aflairs. There is a widows' fund connected with it, from which the widows

of members receive a liberal annuit3^ The entry-money to the Company varies

from about £1-45 to considerably upwards of £200, the exact amount being deter-

mined by the ages of applicants for admission.     ^

The principal administration and jjatronage of three of the educational hospitals

in Edinburgh, viz. George Watson's Hospital, the Merchant Maiden Hospital, and

Daniel Stewart's Hospital, were vested in the Company, and to it were also con-

fided the chief management and patronage of James Gillespie's Hospital for the

maintenance of aged people, in connexion with which was a Free Primary School

for boys. Each of these four Trusts possessed a large hospital building, in which,

previous to the recent changes, the foundationers resided, and where those of the

first three were also educated ; and from the able and economical manner in which

their respective funds have been managed, their capital stocks have very largely

increased.

   (I.) George Watson's Hospital was founded by George Watson, accountant to

the Bank of Scotland in Edinbm-gh. He died in 1723, and bequeathed £12,000 to
endow an hospital for the maintenance and education of boys. Those who were

qualified for admission were sons and grandsons of merchants, burgesses, and guild
brothers, or ministers of Old Church, preference being given to those of the name

of Watson and Davidson. The income of this Trust now amounts to about £8000
a year. The number of boys educated and maintained in its hospital building be-
                                                                                                                                      ;

fore the reform was eighty-six. The master, twelve assistants, and treasm-er of the

Merchant Company, five members of the Town Council, and one of the Established

Church Clergy of Edinburgh, constitute the management.

(II.) The Merchant Maiden Hospital was founded in 1605 by the Edinburgh

Merchant Company and the widow of James Hair, druggist in Edinburgh, for the

maintenance and instruction of girls. The income of the Trust is about £6000 a

year. Previous to the changes it had seventy-five foundationers. Those eligible

for admission were the daughters or granddaughters of merchant burgesses of

Edinburgh, or of ministers thereof and suburbs, or of those who have been gover-

nors of, or benefactors to, the hospital. The management is in the hands of five

members of the Town Council, the Master, Treasurer, and two Assistants of the

Merchant Company, three of the Clergy of the city and suburbs, the Earl of Mar,

--and nine persons elected by the Mercliant Company in all, twenty-two.

(HI.) l)aniel Stewart "s Hospital was founded by Daniel Stewart, of the Exche-

quer, who died in 1814, leaving upwards of £13,000, to accumulate for the purpose

of building and endowing an hospital for the maiutenauce and education of boys.

Those qualified for admission were sons of honest and industrious parents of Edin-

burgh and suburbs, including Leith, wliose circumstances in life did not enable

them suitably to support and educate their children at other schools, preference

being giveu to those of the name of Stewart or Macfarlane. The annual income

of this Trust is upwards of £5000, and the number of foundationers was sixt^'-nine.

The Master, Treasm-er, and twelve Assistants of the Merchant Company constitute

the management.

(IV.) The last of these institutions, James Gillespie's Hospital and Free School,

was founded by James Gillespie, of Spylaw, merchant and tobacconist in Edin-

burgh, who, by his will dated in 179G, destined the greater part of his property to

the endowment of a charitable school for boys, and of a hospital for the aliment

and maintenance of old men and women. About forty aged foundationers were

maintained in the hospital building. The persons qualified for admission were, the

servants of the founder, or persons of his name, above the age of 55 persons be-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

from any part of Scotland at the age of 55. The Free School was opened in 1803,

and had about 100 boj-s. For some time no fees were charged, but subsequently,

and until the recent reform, the pupils were made to pay a small sum per month,

and this change had the effect of increasing their number, which latterly amounted

to about 150. The annual income of the foundation is about £1800. The manage-

ment is in the hands of the Master, twelve Assistants, and Treasurer of the Mer-

chant Company, five members of the Town Coimcil, and the Ministers of St. An-

drew's and St. Stephen's churches.

For upwards of a quarter of a century there has been a gi'owing feeling in Scot-

land against what is known as the hospital system ; and, happily, people generally
are now coming to believe in the truth of the saying that children should be brought

--up in families not in flocks. The education of large numbers of children apart

from their parents, relatives, or friends, and without their having almost any inter-

course with other persons except the oflicials of the hospital establishments, was a
system unnatural in itself, and not calculated to make them in after life useful

members of society. With whatever zeal those who were so brought up might be

trained niorall}' and intellectuallj-, many were found, on the completion of their

education, to be devoid of that general intelligence which is acquired from inter-

course with friends in the home circle ; and when they left the hospitals to begin

the business of life, they were, as a rule, unable to take their places with others

whose scholastic training had not been superior, but which had been carried on

under happier circumstances. Altogether, it was felt that, in return for the large

sum of money expended upon them, comparatively small benefits were derived

and it was to abolish this state of things that the Scheme w.as devised.

The Merchant Company had for a long time been desirous of reforming the in-

stitutions referred to, and with this view they obtained, about nineteen years ago,

Parliamentary authority to admit daj'-scholars, selected from the privileged classes, -

to George Watson's Hospital, to be educated gratuitously along with the founda-
                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

tioners. Scarcely, however, had even this small liberty been gi-antcd, than they
·were privately given to understand that the passing of the Bill was considered a
mistake, and "that no more applications need be made to Parliament for permission
to alter the wills of founders. As it seemed, then, only a waste of money to en-
deavour to obtain additional powers, the Company did not fail to stretch those they
had to the utmost extent. In the case of the Merchant Maiden Hospital, they ad-
mitted as day-pupils a limited number of ghls belonging to the pri-i'ileged classes
and while tliey deeply regretted that they could not make a more extended use of
their funds, they felt that the blame of this did not lie at their door. In the mean-
time, however, the cry against the hospital system continued, and the Assistant
Koyal Commissioners reported that there were large revenues connected with the
liospitals in Scotland which did comparatively little educational good. Although

the Mercliant Company believed that their institutions would bear favourable com-
parison with similar ones either in Scotland or England, yet it was deemed expe-

dient to endeavour to get their usefulness extended by all possible means. Accord-

ingly, in 18G9, on the representations of the Company, the " Endowed Institutions
(Scotland) Act" was brought into Parliament, as a Government measure, by the

then Lord Advocate (Sir James MoncrieH"). It encountered considerable opposi-

tion, but the Company having obtained the support of the managers of two or

three similar foundations in Scotland in behalf of tlie measure, it finally

passed.

  The Act gives power to the Home Secretary to issue a Provisional Order for in-

creasing the usefulness and efficiency, and for extending the benefits of any En-
dowed Institution in Scotland, on a petition of the Governors thereof; and if the
order lie forty days on the tables in both Houses of Parliament without an address

being presented, it becomes law.
   Alter the Act was passed, a Scheme for reforming the four institutions had to bo

prepared. No gi-oup of educational hospitals, or even any individual one, had

hitherto been efficiently reformed, and there was therefore no plan in operation
which could form any guide in the matter. AVhatever scheme might be devised,
it would of necessity require to give good grounds for believing that it would

efficiently and satisfactorily utilize the large funds to be disposed of Eesides,
there was this further difficulty, that it had to be framed in a way which would
satisfy the Merchant Company and the Governors of the four hospitals on the one

hand, and have a fair chance of being accepted hj the Home Secretai-y and Par-

liament on the other.

In preparing the Scheme, it was specially kept in view that it shovdd be of

such a kind as would not be likely to clash with the plans which other hospitals
in Edinburgh might contemplate undertaking, so that money might not be squan-

dered in fruitless competition. Particularly, regard was had to keep clear of the

work which the Governors of George Ileriot's Hospital were accomplishing with

their outdoor schools in the education of poor children.

 --The following is a brief outline of the leading features of the Scheme : They are

(1) the removal of all the foundationers from tlie f<5ur hospital buildings, and pro-

viding for their maintenance elsewhere                                                                                                                                                   (2) the converting of these buildings into

considering the Scheme, at which a resolution generally approving of it was unani-

mously passed. In order to ascertain the opinions of the directors of similar insti-

tutions in and near Edinburgh regarding the matter they were invited to a con-

ference. At this conference the Scheme was very fully considered, and, on the

motion of Sir Alexander Girant, the Principal of the University, who is a Governor

of two of the hospitals, a resolution cordially approving "of its general scope was
unanimously cavried.

   After the approval of the Scheme by a general meeting of the Merchant Com-

pany, separate Schemes or proposed provisional orders based on the general Scheme,
and extended as to details, for each of the four hospitals, together with petitions

to the Home Secretary, prajdng that he would sanction their being carried out,
were in due course approved of by the Company and Governors. With some sli'>-ht
modifications, the Home Secretary agreed, subject to the approval of the Lord

Advocate, which was afterwards given, to issue the Provisional Orders.
   The Provisional Orders, lying the required number of days upon the tables in

both Houses of Parliament without an address being presented,became law in the end
ofJuly last year ( 1870), just as the schools inEdinburgh were closing for the holidays.
It was determined to take measures at once for having the four hospital buildino-s

opened as day-schools in the beginning of the following session in September, and
otherwise to proceed in carrying out the Scheme. Towards this end, the first thing
to be accomplished was to remove the foundationers from the buildino's, so that

the work of adapting them for their new purpose might begin. It was decided to
have in them three gTaded schools for boys and two for girls, so that each of the

different classes of society for whom they were designed might find in one or other

of them an education suited to its own requirements.

   The building of James Gillespie's Hospital was accordingly chosen for the
lowest grade schools of both boys and girls which it was arranged to establish,

Daniel Stewart's and George Watson's for the other two boys' schools, and that
of the Merchant Maiden Hospital for the upper girls' school. There would thus be

--equal to five graded schools in the four buildings those in Gillespie's and the

Merchant Maiden Hospital buildings being the two for girls, and those in Gillespie's,
Stewart's, and AVatson's the three for boys. The word hospital, when used in
connexion with education, was so repugnant to the general community that, in so

tion." For each of these institutions a head-master was appointed, whose emolu-

ments were to consist of a salary, and an additional sum for every pupil who should

attend the scliool o^-er which he was to preside. For the upper girls' school a
lady- superintendent was also engaged. These persons were appointed by the Go-
vernors, at whose pleasure they were to hold their offices. Each of the head-
masters was to be responsible for the efficient working of the school under his
charge ; and, in order to do them full justice in this respect, they were to appoint
and dismiss their own teachers and governesses, the Governors fixing and payin»-
the salaries. The foundationers were to attend the school belonging to the Trust
with which they were connected, and children of the general public wlio passed an
examination suitable to their respective ages, and satisfactory to the Governors,
were to be admitted to all the schools on payment of moderate fees. In sclectiuo-

out of the applicants those wlio were to be admitted, regard was to be had to the
merits and attainments of each as tested by the examination. In all the institu-

tions there were to be three departments (an elementary, a junior, and a senior),
each of which was to be divided into classes containing a limited number of pupils,

grouped according to their attainments, and the whole of the pupils, with the ex-

ception of those in Gillespie's schools, were to supply their own class-books.

   In the lowest gi-ade schools (James Gillespie's), the course of instruction was

designed to include Englisli in all its branches, writing, arithmetic, vocal music,

and drill. The l)oys were also to be taught mechanical drawing, and the o-ii-Js
sewing and knitting. Both male and female teachers were to be employed, and
the classes were not to contain more than fifty children. The fees, includin"- the
use of school-books, have been fixed at 3.5., 4s., and 5s. a quarter for the entire
coarse. In Daniel Stewart's Institution and George Watson's College-Schools for
Boys the course of study was to include the English, Latin, Greek, French, and
German languages; writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, algebra, mathematics

drawing, vocal music, botany, natural Iiistorj', natural philosopliy, chemistry, drill

gymnastics^ fencing, and dancing. There was to be a classical and a modern or

Stewart's Institution to such pupils as desired it. In both scliools male teachers
only were to be employed, and the number of pupils in each class was not to ex-

ceed a maximum of forty, so that the education of every one of them might be

fully attended to. The fees for the whole course have been fixed at from 10s. to .30s.
a quarter. In the upper girls' school (" The Edinburgh Educational Institution ")
the course of study was to embrace all the branches usually taught in the principal

institutions and boarding-schools foryoung ladies, and to include the English, French,
German, and Latin languages ; lectures on literature ; writing, arithmetic, book-
keeping, algebra, mathematics, physical science, drawing, vocal music, instruction

on the pianoforte, drill, calisthenics, dancing, and needlework. As in the upper boys'
schools, the classes were not to contain more than forty pupils. With the excep-
tion of the elementary department, where female teachers only were to be em-

ployed, the institution was to be taught altogether by masters, with a governess
attached to each class, to be constantly in attendance upon it. The fees for the

whole course have been fixed at from" 12s. Gd. to 50s. a quarter. In the second

AGerman. In all the schools religious instruction was to be given.  " conscience

clause " was put in operation. At first, only about ten children took advantage of

it, but as the session advanced no exception whatever existed on behalf of even a

single pupil.

   It will be seen that, for the education to be given in the schools, the fees are

very low. The principle upon which they were fixed, as regards the three upper

schools, is, that they be sufficient to cover the expense of the additional teaching

required, without anything being charged as against the rent of the hospital

buildings, which were to be turned into day-schools, or for the expense of the
teaching staff" formerly kept up for the foundationers when the buildings wereused
for the double purpose of giving board and education, and which was expensive if

reckoned at so much a pupil. Take, for illustration, the upper girls' school (the
Edinburgh Educational Institution), with its 1200 pupils. Of these, about 70
were foundationers, and 1130 day-scholars. For the latter, the number of teachers
and governesses was sufficiently increased, the expense of this new staff being de-
frayed by the fees which these day-scholars pay, and which amount to between
£7000 and £8000 a year. Thus, if there had been no other new expenses con-
sequent upon the changes, the education of these 11 -"'O day-pupils would have been
productive of neither gain nor loss to the Trust. But there was the rent of the new

houses to pay for, in which some of the foundationers were to reside, and those of

them who were -to be boarded out in families would cost somewhat more than
when they lived in the hospital building. Then money had to be found for the
bursaries and fellowships, &c. To meet these new expenses the number of

foundationers was partially to be reduced. Gillespie's Schools, being established

for the children of the humbler classes on payment of low fees, are, of course,

productive of a small annual loss, which is, however, met by the growing income

of the foundation.

   The money required for the expenses of the new purposes of the Scheme was to

be obtained bjr reducing the number of foundationers of the three ediicational
hospitals. The reduction, which was to be eflected as soon as convenient, was as
follows, viz. the foundationers of the Merchant Maiden Hospital to be reduced

from 75 to 01, those of George Watson's from 80 to GO, and those of Daniel

Stewart's from 69 to 40. The preference claims of childien who bore particular

names were altogether abolished. Great evils arose from the obligation to admit
such children to educational hospitals. Their education was too often neglected

by their guardians in their earlier years, who thought that there was little use

troubling themselves about it, or pajang school-fees since they would be sure of
getting them into a hospital where everything would be done for them. The
consequence was, that these children were generally unfit to be placed in the same
class with others of a like age; they required an unusually large amount of labour

to be expended upon them, and, as a rule, were a drag upon the whole institution.
          TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                    207

   In regard to the presentations given over to the general community, it may he

proper to notice here that the apparent loss to the privileged classes is more than
compensated hy the solid advantages given to foundationers, not only by their
attending the day-schools while being boarded either with their friends or in the
boarding houses of the Governors, but also by the spirit of meritorious emulation
from without, which works so beneficially upon them as upon all the other pupils

of the institutions. Further, the special identity of foundationers is now lost, and

a spirit of merit runs through all. Moreover, neither children nor grandchildren

of members of the Merchant Company, except those who were in reduced circum-

stances, could formerlj^ get benefit from the foundations; but now, under the
altered state of things, the schools and all the advantages connected therewith are
of course open to them.

   The Scheme, as formerly mentioned, contemplated the removal of the whole of
the foundationers from the hospital buildings. Of those connected with the three
Educational Trusts, it was decided to maintain a portion in boarding-houses, under
the superintendence of the Governors, and to board out the remainder with persons

of whom they might approve. Accordingly, suitable houses were rented, and the

plan as to the foundationers carried out. It was agreed that the aged foundationers

                                                                                                                                     sption of

ten, who were old and frail, they all preferred the pension. For these ten, as well
as for others whora the Governors may elect from time to time on vacancies arising,

the building formerly used as the Primary School has been fitted up. As to the

future, it is of course intended to continue the system of giving outdoor pensions,

as well as to maintain the Hospital Home for old people.
  An important featm-e of the Scheme, in addition to providing the general com-

mimity with a superior education at moderate fees, is to give children of great

merit, who attend any one of the schools, a high-class education, without almost

any expense to their trieuds. This feature was introduced not only with the view

of stimulating tlie exertions of all the pupils, but also of enabling children of great

ability (even tliose whose friends were only in circumstances to place them at the

lowest grade schools) to turn their intellect to the best account, so that they might

be fitted to occupy a high position in life, and possibly render important services
to the country. Towards this end there are to be given up for competition amongst

the pupils of all the schools a portion of the reduced number of presentations to

the foundations. That number is to be not less than a fourth of those of George

Watson's and the Merchant INIaiden Trusts, and not less than a half of Daniel

Stewart's. The ages at which the pupils are to compete for the presentations are,

for boys, imder 10, 12, and  14 years                                           for  girls, under  12, 14, and  IG years.  The
                                                                             ;

--successful competitors are to be maintained and educated at the expense of the

foundations boys until they are 16 years of age, when they should be ready for

the University, and girls until they are 18. These ages may be afterwards altered

if the Governors see fit. Then, in order to enable meritorious pupils further to
prosecute their studies, power has been acquired to found twenty-two bursaries of
£25 a year, tenable for four years; and eight travelling scholarships of £100 a
year, tenable for tln-ee j-ears, all of which are to be awarded also by competitive

examination. Estimating the value of a presentation at £50 a year, the gross

--amount of benefits which a pupil may derive are a presentation for six years
= =£300
                                         ;
          a bursary on leaving the .schools of £25 a year for four years                                        £100 ; and

thereafter a scholarship of £lOO a year for three years =£300; making altogether

£700. I need scarcely again state that these benefits have the advantage of being

open for competition to female pupils as well as male. The Governors have also
the power at the end of each session, nn the recommendation of the examiners of

the schools or head-masters, to give substantial rewards to pupils of distinguished

merit ; and the plan intended to be adopted in carrying out this part of the Scheme
is to present those of them who do not succeed in gaining places on the foundations

with school bursaries, equal in value to the amount of their fees for the followin"-

session.

In the upper boys' school the education was to branch off at a certain stage into
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

the two divisions of what are called the Classical and Modem or Conimercial sidei

and while, of course, there is provision in the Edinburgh University for the com-
pletion of the former, there was greatly needed, in the interest of the latter, a
Chair of Commercial and Political Economy and Mercantile Law. Under the
powers embraced in the Scheme, such a Chair has been endowed and a Professor

appointed.

    There was yet another sphere of usefulness which it was contemplated to over-
take. While power was asked which would enable the Governors so greatly to

Wbenefit the general community by the establishing of these schools &c., means

of which meritorious children of the humbler classes could receive an education of
the best kind, fitted to advance them in life, and while power was also asked to

--do something for the University, it was thought riglit to look with a kindly eye

on the very poorest of the community to include in the Scheme powers for estab-
lishing Industrial »Schools, to assist in gathering in the neglected boys and girls of
the city. The carrying out of this work is imder consideration, great difficulty
having been experienced in view of the Government Education I5ill for Scotland
(which was expected to pass this session) containing express provisions for indus-
trial schools, compassing the whole wants of the city by levied rates.
(. The author then described the favourable reception of the Scheme by the Govern-
ment, the press, and the public generally.

   The advertisements announcing the opening of the day-schools appeared about
the end of July last year, and in about a fortnight no fewer than 2G00 children had
passed the entrance-examination. Shortly afterwards the number which could be
accommodated in three of the four buildings was made up, there being, inclusive
of about 200 foundationers, 3400 pupils enrolled. The head-masters then, seeing
the size of the schools which they were to have, advertised for teachers. The plan

of selection which they adopted was, while engaging those whom they thought

most suitable, to give a preference to such as would bo likely to suffer by the new
schools. They could not do more in their interest, without running the risk of

sacrificing the efficienc^y of the schools for the benefit of individuals, however
deserving otherwise, and thereby imperilling the success of the entire educational
Scheme.

    In carrj'iug out a gi'cat reform like this, it coidd not be otherwise but that incon-
veniences and partial losses to some teachers would occur. There was, however,
the satisfaction of knowing that, by the limited number of pupils in each class, an
increased number of teachers were employed, and that their salaries were consider-
ably greater than they previously liad been. It is understood that, in consequence
of this, good teachers in some other schools in Edinbargh_ have since been better
paid than they formerly were. ^

   The schools had only been opened for a few weeks when their success as efficient
institutions seemed certain. The large number of pupils enabled their being

grouped according to their attainments so thoroughly, that those placed in the
same class were all but equal. Their individual teachers therefore, instead of
having to give separate instruction, as it were, to children in different stages of

progress, of which most classes are composed, when speaking to one pupil were
addressing themselves to the capacity of all. Thus the classes had a much gi-eater
amount of instruction given them than would have been the case in other circum-
stances. Again, the large benefits to be obtained by competition at the end of the
session had a wonderful effect in stimulating the exertions of both pupils and
teachers. The consequence was that rapid progress was made in all the schools.

Parents, not slow to observe this, in calling at the institutions, said that since their

children attended them, they had worked at their lessons in a way which they had

never done before, and expressed themselves satisfied with the schools in the

highest degree. Persons interested in education from many parts of the countiy
visited the schools, all of whom, the autlior believed, were most favourably im-
pressed with what they saw ; and applications for the admission of other children
became so numerous, that at the end of the first quarter the number on the super-
numerary roll was very lai'ge.

   The Scheme provides that a general examination of the institutions has to be
made once a year by examiners appointed for that purpose, who are to report upon
       --

       TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS,                              209

tlio proficiency of tlie scliolaa'3, and ou the position of tlie scliools as regards instruc-
tion and discipline. The examination is to be conducted by a person wholly uncon-
nected -with the Institutions. The first examination was conducted by Professor

--W. B. Hodgson, who reports thus regarding the upper girls' Institution : " Pro-

bably there is nowhere to be found so large a school tor girls so admirably organized
and so efficiently conducted. The large number of pupils, far from causing an
excessive number in any one class, actually facilitates the work of classificatiop,
and by the multiplication of classes, meets the difficulty of imeq[ual progress in

pupils about the same age. Where all deserve commendation, it is hard and per-
haps invidious to select. But I may truly say that, while the usual branches of a
girl's instruction are vigorously attended to, while English, and what it implies,

and French and German, and Music and Drawing, hold each its proper place under
zealous and efficient teachers, Arithmetic is taught with unusual care, and there
are special classes for senior pupils in Latin, Geometry, and Algebra ; and the pro-
gress and manifest interest in these subjects fully refute the notion that they are

unfit for the study of girls. On the whole the state of this school reflects very
high credit on its Principal, Lady Superintendent, and Teachers ; and it must do
much to raise the standard of women's education throughout the whole country."

 --Regarding the schools generally. Professor Hodgson states : " It is altogether

an astounding organization, and one is quite overwhelmed by the attempt to esti-
mate its results in even the near future. It is something to have lived to see this

sight : it is more to have done aught to bring it about."
   Professor Oakeley inspected the Music-classes of the upper girls' schools, but nc

report from him has yet been received.
   The author then described the arrangements made for atfording increased accom-

modation, and which include the opening of another girls' school.

   For next session tlie number of pupils already enrolled in the difitirent schools is
somewhat as follows, viz. :

       James Gillespie's Schools for boys and girls (full)  1200
       The Edinburgh Educational Institution for girls      1100
       George Watson's College-Schools for boys             1000
       George Watson's College-Schools for girls (full)
       Uaniel Stewart's Institution for boys                 500
                                                             300

           Total                                            4100

or already 700 more pupils than attended the schools last session, while new appli-

cations for admission are constantly being received.

   From what has been said, it will be seen that the annual income of these four
foundations is about £20,800. Before the changes which came into operation last

year, they maintained and educated about 230 children, maintained 40 old persons,

aided a Primary School containing 150 boys, and employed 23 teachers, who

received about £1730 a year. In the beginning of next session they will be main-
taining 175 children, and educating probably about 4500, while they will be paying
teachers and governesses not less than £18,000 a year. It has been estimated that

the annual saving to the public, by the reduced cost of education given in these
schools, will be about £30,000. Further, the number of the aged foundationers
attached to Gillespie's Trust has already been increased, and it is anticipated that
in twelve months its funds will admit of a still greater number being placed on the
roll. There will also be funds for the payment of the annual endowment of £450
a year for the new Chair in the University. In a short time the Governors will
be in a position to decide whether or not the Scotch Educational Bill of the
Government will take up the whole field of Industrial Schools in the city.

   In conclusion the author expressed the hope that what the Merchant Company

have done in using the funds at their disposal to extend the blessings of education,

may be the means of inducing the Governors of similar foundations to endeavour

to increase the usefulness and extend the public benefits thereof, and in such a
manner as inay be supposed would have been commended by the generous founders
themselves, had they lived in these our days of progi'esa and reform.

 On the Measurement of Man and his Faculties. By Samuel Beown, F.S.S.

   The science of probability, wliich in the course of 200 years has been perfected
by the great mathematicians of England, Germany, and especially of France, and

has rendered such serrice in astronomical researches, is still in its infancy as regards
its application to the problems of political and social economy, which directly
concern the growth of civilization, and the physical, moral, and intellectual pro-
gress of man. James Bernoulli by its aid proposed to investigate questions of in-

terest in morals and in economic science ; but his work was not published till 1713,
eight years after his death, and in the meantime his nephew, Nicholas Bernoulli, in
an essay in 1709, had treated of such questions as the number of persons living-
after a certain number of years out of a given number born, of the period of time

at the end of which an absent man of whom no tidings have been heard may be

considered to be dead, of the value of an annuity on human life, of marine insu-
rance, the probability of testimony, and of the innocence of an accused person. Not

to mention the extension of the science in the wi-itings of Condorcet, Laplace, and

Poisson to the questions of decisions of legal tribunals, of elections, of the relative

force of opinions in the minority of voters, the credibility of history ; the Census,
tables of mortality, marriage, and insurances, to illusions and mental phenomena,

we find in recent years the greatest impulse given to scientific methods of collect-

ing and comparing statistics has been by M. Quetelet, the Director of the Ilo3'al
Observatory at Bruxelles, President of the Central Statistical Commission of Bel-

gium, and the Perpetual Secretary of the Academy of Sciences. He was one of

the early founders of this Section at the Meeting at Cambridge in 1833, and was
the originator of the International Statistical Congresses which have been the
means of eiFecting such vast improvements in the collection, publication, and com-
parison of Government Statistics in every country in Europe.

   In the application of scientific methods of observation to study the physical and
moral qualities of man, an essential part of the inquiiy is as to his growth, and
the relative proportion of the various parts of the body at different ages until his
complete matm-ity. The last work of M. Quetelet, entitled " Anthi'opom^trie, ou
mesui-es des difierentes facult^s de I'homme," recently published, comprises the re-

sidts of many years of observations, in which, by the assistance of scientific friends,

artists and medical men, he has succeeded in collecting sufficient and trustworthy
facts to trace the law of gi-owth in every portion of the himian body at all periods

of life.

   The methods formerly employed to ascertain the true proportions which consti-
tute the typical man were not satisfactory. Natm-alists did not sufficiently study
the averages to discover the laws of their agreement or divergence on certain

points ; artists selected such types of beauty or strength as suited their special pur-

pose. But if some model of the human race existed the proportions of which

were so fixed that any deviations from it in excess or defect could only arise from

accidental causes, the observations recorded may be divided into groups at equal
intervals, and according to the theory of probability the specific number which
ought to be found in each group may be predicted beforehand, with a very near
approach to accuracy. The gi-eater the number of observations the more certainly
will the observed number in each group agree with the number calculated by the
theory. The group which approaches nearest to the mean will be the most nume-

rous, and the other gi-oups will be found to contain numbers, as they differ from

the mean in excess or defect, in exact proportion to the coefficients of the terms
of the binomial theorem. In accordance with this law dwarfs and giants cease to
be casual monstrosities. If out of a sufficient number of observations, taken in any
country, of the number of people measured at regular gradations of h eighty the
dwarfs and giants had been pm-posely excluded, we ought by means of this law
to be able to predict nearly not only the numbers which had been omitted, but
their relative statures as compared with the rest of the people.

  A remarkable confii-mation of this law was given by Mr. E. B. Elliott in the

measurement of the height of 25,878 volunteers to the United States Army during

the Civil War. The intervals of height were taken at every 25 millimetres. At
the mean height, 1-75 metre, the number found by measurement was 4054, or 157
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                         211

in every 1000, whilst the number calculated by the theory -svonld be 153 in every
1000. At all the other intervals the calculated and estimated numbers in eighteen

different groups were almost equally near.
   Comparisons are given by M. Quetelet of the measurements of the statues of

ancient art, and of those in the rules laid down by the greatest artists or ^s-riters

on the proportions of man. All the measures tend to establish the fact that the

proportions of the human form of the present day are almost identical with those
deduced by observation from the most regular statues of Grecian art.

   The application of the law is also shown by th'e close approximation in the
observed and calculated numbers of conscripts for France, Belgium for 20 years
of observation, and in Italy for those at 21 years of age, as well as by two sets of
observations in the United States. In the three former countries the mean height
observed was nearly the same ; but in the United States it was higher by 6 or 8
centimetres, though this was partly accounted for by the Volimteers there being
of a more mature age.

  A further example is given in a comparison of the measurements of the circum-

ference of the chests of Scottish and American soldiers, the mean of the former
being 40 inches, at which the observed numbers were 188, and the calculated num-
ber would be 199 in every 1000 ; and the mean of the latter was 35 inches, at
which the observed mmiber was 204, and the calculated number by theory would
be 190 in every 1000. The law applies equally to the weight, strength, and other

physical qualities of man.
   The extension of this method of obseiwation to the actions of man, which are

dependent on the exercise of his free will, indicate in the clearest manner that,
however imperceptibly to the casual obsei-ver, they follow certain laws which are

as regular in their operation as the law of mortality. Thus, in five consecutive

quinquennial periods, from 1840 to 1865, the marriages of men at certain groups of
ages throughout life, with women at the same or other groups of ages, very slightly
differed from the mean of the same groups for the whole period of twenty-five

myears. The same results may be seen a still more marked manner in England,

by comparing the marriages of men at every group of successive five years of age
from tinder 20 to 85, with women at those groups of ages in the three years 1846,
1847, and 1848 with the three years 1851, 1852, and 1853. The near approxima-

tion of the numbers at every age in the two periods is most remarkable, especially
if they are subdivided into marriages of bachelors with spinsters or widows, and
of widowers with spinsters or widows.

    Other statistics illustrating the regidarity of action in the free will of man, are

those showing the tendencj' to crime at particular ages, and even the nature of
crimes which seem to vary against person, or against property according to the age
of the criminal. The object of this paper is to point out the true scientific method

of collecting and comparing statistics, to draw attention to the remarkable Tables
of M. Quetelet, showing the law of the growth of man, and of the proportions of
the various parts of his body at everj' age of life, and further to urge that the same
method of investigation should be extended to the many questions affecting his
moral and intellectual faculties which at present are not considered to be within

the compass of statistical research.

On a proposed Doomsday Booh, giving the Value of the Governmental Property

   as a basis for a sound system of National Finance and Accounts. By F.

   P. Fellows, F.S.S.

   The author described the present method of voting and accounting for the na-
tional expenditm-e, amounting to about £70,000,000 yearly, and maintained that
there was a great incompleteness in the accounts, which could not be rectified till
a Doomsday Book, giving the value of the National Governmental property, was
compiled. This must necessarily be the basis of any sound system of national
finance and accounts, as, without it, expenditure for capital and for the cuiTcnt pur-

                                                                                              14*

poses of the year must be unavoidably confused, so that a Government may aslc for

£70,000,000 ill any year, and yet spend for the year in question £80,000,000, or

ouly £60,000,000 without the House of Commons or the public being able to de-
tect it. The paper recommended, as a conclusion to this Doomsday Boole, the

compilation of accounts for each Government department similar to those worked
out by the author and Mr. Seely (recommended by Mr. Seely's Committee for

adoption), and now being introduced into the Admiralty. It pointed out the great

control these accounts gave the Admiralty over its expenditure, and attributed a
considerable part of the yearly saving of about £1,500,000 that-had been effected

in the Navy to the information thus afforded. The author said that with certain
exceptions, such as the army and the navy, the only accounts compiled and pre-
sented to Parliament were the Estimates and Finance Accounts ; and that these
iiuance accounts, i. e. "the Estimates," "the Appropriation Accounts," and

" Statements of the Savings and Deficiencies on the Grants," as given in the
Estimates, were, strictly speaking, merely the banking accounts of the nation, and

gave little control over the expenditure, and afforded to the House of Commons no

information as to the economical results thereof. For instance, the estimates gave

the sums the House of Commons authorized the various departments to expend or
draw from the public purse or bank. And the Appropriation Accounts and the
" Statement of the Savings and Deficiencies on the grants " gave the actual money
expended or drawn from the public purse or bank. He maintained that the public
national accounts ought to go much further than this, and to show the application
and the results of the money thus withdrawn from the " Bank," and urged, from

the illustrations given as to the Admiralty accounts and expenditure, the great re-
sults that might be expected therefrom. What, it was asked, would be thought of
a great railway or other company whose only account presented to its shareholders

--was its bankers' book which had no capital account, no account of the value of its
--plant, buildings, machinery, rolling stock, stores, &c. which mixed together its

current and capital account (as it must necessarily do under such circumstances),
and what woidd be the result of such a system of management, or, rather, want of

management ? Any man of business would at once say that there must necessarily

be very great waste, if not eventual ruin to the company. Yet, was the Govern-
ment in a different position in this matter, and could we expect that these evils
did not exist ? The answer surely could scarcely be the affirmative. The paper
concluded by recommending the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire
into and carry out this stock-taking and valuation on one unifomi principle for all
departments, so that a Doomsday Book might be compiled as the starting-point for
a system of finance and accounts similar to that introduced into the Admiralty,
by which the Government and the House of Commons would be enabled to have
the most effective control over our great annual expenditure. The author also
incidentally referred to the ancient Doomsday Book of England, as being the

greatest achievement of the Conqueror, and saw no reason why it ahould not be

recompiled on an extended basis.

   This Institution was established in 185G for the restoration of young women

Nvilling to return to the paths of \irtue. It was formed on the principle of provid-

ing for them a small home, whose an-angements might be more of the nature of a

family than larger institutions can possibly be.

It is situated about two miles from Edinburgh, in an airy and healthy locality,

as a proof of which sickness of any kind has scarcely, if ever, been experienced

amongst its inmates ; the usual nimiber of them is about 30, although two or
three more could be accommodated.

The superintendents are a matron, assistant- matron, sewing-mistress, and two

laundresses, and the chief employment of the women is washing and laundry

work, with a little needlework, instruction in needlework being regularly given

b^'' tlie sewing-mistress. Regular instruction is also given in reading, writing, and

arithmetic, with household work and religious knowledge.

  The Home is always open for the reception of inmates ; and it is chiefly through

the missionaries, whose work it is to endeavour to reclaim the fallen, that inmates

are received.

After bemg a year in the Home, situations are provided for the girls, and an out-

fit given to them ; and, as far as possible, an oversight is kept of them after they

leave the Home. The Committee endeavour ns much as possible to send the girls

to situations at a distance from their former haunts, and have on different occa-

sions procured situations and sent several of them to Canada, c&c.

  The management of the Home is vested in two Committees of Ladies and Gen-

tlemen appointed by the subscribers, but the general management is vested in the
Gentlemen's Committee, who have the control of the funds.

  The property of the Home was purchased by the Committee four years ago, at

the price of £630 ; and they have since expended, in making repairs', alterations,

and additions to it, so as to fit it more completely for the purposes of a Home, close
upon £900, the whole of which money the Committee have been enabled to pay

through extra subscriptions, &c., so that now there is no debt remaining upon it.
  The annual cost of maintenance of the Home in 1870, as per

detailed accounts published in the Annual Report for that year,

was £941 11 5

(which included £185 4s. Ad., the expenditure connected with

carrying on the washing work), whereof there was received from

the work of the inmates in washing, &c                           GO! 13 4

       being provided by public subscriptions, &c.
   In connexion with this, it is right to state that all the water required for wash-
ing, except the rain-water from the roofs, has to be carted from a burn about a
quarter of a mile distant from the Home.

   In the eleven years from 1860 to 1870, both inclusive, on an average thirty-two

young women have annually left the Home for situations, received back by friends,

On the Mode for Assessing for the Poor-Jiates. By James Meiexe, F.S.S.

    On the Administration of the Poor Law. By W. A. Peteekin, General

                                  Siqjerintendent of Poor (Scotland).

   It was the wish of the entire community that no one should die of actual star-
vation, and therefore all plans for the distribution of fimds raised for the relief of
the poor were based on the minimum necessary to maintain life. This was the

absolute requirement. The Poor Law of Scotland required " needful sustentation."

The interpretation of that term was left to the judgment of local administrations,
and tbere were 88.5 separate bodies, each acting on its own responsibility. Their
decisions were subject, on complaint, to the review of a central authority, insti-
tuted by Parliament. Uniformity, under such circumstances, was hopeless, and if
practicable, would not be desirable. There was no point to which attention re-
quired more to be given than to the necessity of each case combining in itself
destitution and disability. The question of disability was practically more easily
214 EEPORT 1871.

determined than that of destitution, and on that point there was the greatest
diversity of opinion amongst all classes. The chief advantage to be gained from the
expedient of a poor-house was, that it enabled a local board to administer the rates
more satisfactorily to themselves and to tlie public, by checking in a rough kind of

way attempts to impose, and more economically in cases where lodging, nursing, and
clothing were required. After givmg some statistics and results relating to the cost

of pauperism and to illegitimacy, the author referred to the education of pauper
children, and said whether local boards could do more for the education of such
children than they did, by making attendance at school a condition of relief to the
parent, was deserving of consideration ; but the supineness of pauper parents as
to the education of their children was well known, and it must oe borne in mind
that the elder children were frequently material aids in the family struggle for

existence. Having made reference to the improved condition of the paupers com-

pared with that of fifty years ago, and to the provision for medical aid, costing
each parish on an average £40 per annum, he gave some information as to Shetland.

In Scotland outdoor relief was the rule ; for twelve who received relief at their
own homes, only one would be relieved at the poor-house. He concluded by stat-
ing that it was an advantage of the Scotch system of Poor-Law administration
that every recipient of relief was personally known to and visited by local respon-
sible officers, controlled by 885 separate boards, representing all interests ; and
that it was of the utmost importance to all that these local boards should be cou-
Btituted so as to secure an impartial, intelligent, and humane administration.

On the Illegitimacy of Banffshire. By Geoege Seton, Advocate, M.A. Oxon.,

    --Secretary in the General Registry Offke of Births, 6fC. (Scotland).

   Prefatory Note. " Since I undertook to read the following paper, which relates
to the four years ending 1861, I have not had time to examine in detail the Banfl-
shire Birth Registers applicable to a later period ; but I have made such an inves-
tigation as to satisfy myself that a colLatiou of the books pertaining to the four
years ending 1869 ("the latest available records) would establish strikingly similar
results. This will appear from the tabular statements contained in a supplemen-
tary appendix, to which I shall afterwards refer."

    This paper gave elaborate details regarding the illegitimacy of Banfishire during
the four years ending 1861, and embraced a supplementary appendix relative to the
fom' years ending 1869.

 --It showed, inter alia

   (1) That the number of illegitimate births recorded in the 8 divisions, 33
counties, and 1020 registration districts of Scotland has been published in the

quarterly retui-ns of the Registrar-General since the ye.ar 1857.
   (2j That during the four years ending 1861, the north-eastern division of the

country, embracing the counties of Nairn, Elgin, Bans', Aberdeen, and Kincardine,
furnished the largest proportion of illegitimate births ; while the northern division,
embracing the counties of Shetland, Orknej', Caithness, and Sutherland, exhibited

the smallest proportion, the maximum average being 14-7, and the minimum 5"3

per cent.
    (3) That of the counties, during the fom- years in question, Banfi" took the

highest, or rather the lowest place in respect of illegitimacy, showing an average
of very nearly 16 per cent., the ratio for Scotland generally feeing 9 per cent., while
that of certain other northern counties was onfy 3| per cent.*

   The county of Banfi' embraces twenty-six registration districts, with a popula-
tion of 56,020 at the Census of 1861, during which and the three preceding years,
7517 births were registered, of which 1189 were illegitimate ; in other words,
about one in every six of the children recorded was born out of wedlock. "|In the
case of 380 of these illegitimate children, or nearly a third of the whole, the pa-

&ternity was acknowledged at registration (17 18 Vict. c. 80, § 35) ; in sixty-four

    * In 1808 Kirkcaidbright was slightly above Banff in respect to illegitimacy, showing
17-5 against 17'3 per cent. ; while in 1867, Wigtown was 17'9, Kirkcudbright i5'7, Aber-
deen and Kincardine each 14-9, and Dumfries and Banff each 14-5 per cent.

instances the paternity has been subsequently found by Decree of Court, and
recorded in terms of the Statute {Ibid.) ; and in twenty-eight cases the children
have been legitimated by the subsequent marriage of their parents, such alteration
of status being also duly registered {Ihiil. § 36). In a few instances, the judicial
findings relate to children whose paternity was acknowledged at registration, from

which it would appear that, notwithstanding the reputed father's adhibition of his
signatm-e to the register, the mother is occasionally induced to raise an action

 against him.

    " The mothers of no fewer than 571 of the 1189 illegitimate children (very nearly
 one-half) are registered as being domestic servants, 216 as fartn servants, 22 as milli-
 ners or dressmakers, and 36 as washericomen, haivhers, and other miscellaneous avoca-
 tions ; while in the case of 344, or more than a third of the whole, the occupation
 is not specified.* In several cases the mothers appear to have been widoivs, and, in
 a few rare instances, married women living apart from their husbands.

    " From notes by the District Examiner, it appears that the mother of one of the

illegitimate children registered at Keith in 1860 is a pauper, and has given birth to
Jive illegitimate children ; while the mother of one of those registered at Rothie-
may, in the same year, is living idle at home, and has given birth to four illegiti-

mate children."
   Very considerable differences in respect to the amount of illegitimacy present

themselves in the different districts, the maximum rate being upwards of 25 per
cent., and the minimum as low as 6 or 7 per cent. As a rule, the sea-board parishes

have a lower percentage of illegitimacy than the inland ones. Neither the excess
of females over males, nor the comparative number of houses and windowed
rooms, as ascertained at the Census, appear to afford any satisfactory solution of

the differences in question. But with regard to the county generally, the compa-

rative paucity of marriages may, perhaps, have something to do with the large

--amount of illegitimacy.
   The paper concluded as follows : " In a paper which I published in the year

1860, 1 ventured to suggest a variety of causes as accounting for the illegitimacy
of Scotland generally. In the present paper, however, it will be observed that I

have almost entirely confined my remarks to a statement of facts, from which I

incline to think that no verj^ satisfactory deductions can be drawn, in the absence

of such detailed information as could only be obtained from a carefully conducted

local inquiry.

" Even the best districts in Scotland have room for improvement in the matter in

question, and here, in the metropolitan county, we have not much to boast of. I

freely acknowledge the tendency which prompts us to shut our eyes on our own

shortcomings, and to call attention to those of our neighours ; but on the present

occasion, I think it will be admitted that the great and continued preeminence of

myBaurt'shire in the matter of illegitimacy is a sufficient waiTant for  having

selected that county as the subject of my remarks."

The paper was accompanied by several tabular appendices, and also by a series

of extracts bearing upon the subject from the notes appended by the Registrars to

their quarterly returns.

 On the Expediency of recording Still-Births. By Geoege Setok, Advocate,

M.A. Oxon., Secretary in the General Hegistry Office of Births, 6fC. (Scotland).

   This paper mentioned that, while these births are recorded in France and some

--other continental nations, they are not registered either in England or Scotland.
   It showed, inter alia
   That the statistics of the subject are very imperfect.
   That under the old and unsatisfactory system of registration in Scotland, a con-

siderable number of still-births appear to have found their way into the parochial

records.

   That, estimating the stiU-births in Scotland at 41 per cent, of the total births,

their present annual number would amount to upwards of 5000.

  A* more general registration of the occupation of mothers of illegitimate children is

now effected in Banffshire and the other counties of Scotland.

   That the' still-births in Cxlasgow during the three years ending 1852 were cal-
culated by the late Dr. Strang to have aniouuted to 1 in 12, or iipwards of 8 per

cent.*

    That in France their proportion amounts to bet-ween 4 and 4^ per cent., and in
Paris to about 7^ per cent.

    That the ordinary proportion among legitimate children is reckoned to be from
1 in 18, to 1 in 20 of all births, and among illegitimate children three times greater.

    That many more males are still-born than females, viz. 140 to 100, and that
still-births are more frequent in first than in subsequent pregnancies.

    The paper also referred to the difhculty of defining the term " still-birth ; " to the
 opinion of medical practitioners that tlie registration of still-births ought to be
 confined to children born " Viable," or with a capacity to live ; to the Memorial
 addressed to the Registrar-General of Scotland by the Royal College of Physicians,
 Edinburgh, in 1858, in favour of the registration of still-births ; and to the sup-
 posed prejudice in the upper and middle ranks of society against such registration.

    The paper concluded with the following statement :

  --" Prejudice or no prejudice, the question to be decided is simply this : Is it ex-

 pedient that these births should be registered ? While I wish to speak with great
 deference on a subject respecting which a lawyer is probably not so well qualified
 as a medical practitioner to express an opinion, and notwithstanding the very

 decided views to the contrary of my esteemed frieud the Registrar-General

 of Englandt, I have no hesitation in saying that I have long thought that the
 proposal of the College of Physicians should be carried into effect as a matter of

 public policy.

    " In his able pamphlet on ' The Law of the Coroner, and on Medical Evidence in

 the Preliminary Investigation of Criminal Cases,' published in 1855, Dr. Craig, of

 Ratio, says, ' Another apparent step in advance is an enactment in the New Scotcli

 Registration Bill, which came into full operation on the 1st of January, 1855,
 where in cases of new-born children exposed or found dead, or in cases of persons
  found dead, a report is to be sent to the Procurator Fiscal, who, ' in case of a Pre-
  cognition,' is to report to the Registrar before he can enter the case in the register.
 The birth and burial, however, of still-bom children are not to be registered ; and
  thus every facility is afibrded for concealment of pregnancy, and for the crime of

  child murder.'
      " In the interests of medical science, moreover, I think it cannot be doubted that

 the births in question ought to be duly recorded ; and now that we have in each
  of the three portions of the United Kingdom a national system of registration,

  more or less perfect, the facility of doing so is very largely increased. It is no
  doubt desirable that a uniform procedure should be observed in the three kingdoms.
  Already, however, in various important respects, the three systems of registration
  materially dilTer ; and, accordingly, in the matter in question, it might perhaps be
  worth while to make the experiment, in the first instance, in the comparatively
  small sphere of North Britain, leaving England and Ireland to follow, if the expe-
  riment should prove a success. Whether or not fresh legislation would be neces-

  sary is, I think, open to question. Speaking generally, it appears to me that the

  registration of still-births is not excluded in the existing statute. W'ere it'other-
  wise, the regulation relative to the non-registration of still-births would be alto-

  gether unnecessary. If, however, the form of registration to which I shall pre-
  sently allude were to be thought expedient, it would probably require the inter-

   vention of the Legislature, in the shape of a short supplementary Act.

     "As to the mode of practically carrying out the registration of still-births, I am
  quite prepared to offer a few suggestions. On the assumption that the medical

  faculty are agreed upon what ought to be regarded as a still-birth, and that it is

 --found feasible to give inteUigible instructions upon the subject to the Registrars

  upwards of 1000 in number the first point to be determined is, the rci/ister in
  ivhich the entries ought to be made. As I have already stated, the practice in

       * Probably too high an estimate.

France is to record still-birtlis in the death register, and tliis course, I apprehend,

is approved of by some medical practitioners and others in our own country. But
I venture to recommend a different plan.

" It will perhaps he alleged that the events in question must be regarded as either

births or deaths, and registered accordingly ; i. e. either in the bu-th or in the death

register. If the question is to be thus limited , I should incline to prefer the hirth

to the death register, iuasnmch as a stiU-birth caimot be scientifically regarded as

a true death ; and is, indeed, more of a birth than a death. But it does not appear
to follow that still-bu'ths should find their way into either the birth or the death

--register. For many reasons, a separate register, specially prepared for the purpose,

would be the best aiTangement to be transmitted from time to time to the Gene-

ral Registry Office as its pages are filled, and not annuaUy as in the case of the

duplicate registers of births, deaths, and marriages. It appears to be quite unne-

cessary that such   register  should                                                                                                             be  kept  in  duplicate                                          and  at the  end  of every
                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

quarter the number of still-births would be reported by the Registrar in his return

of births, deaths, and marriages. As to the form of the register, I would propose

that it should embrace the following particulars :

   " 1. Number of the entry.

"2. Sex of child.

" 3. Date and place of birth.

" 4. Age of child in months and days, from date of conception.
" 5. Number of the mother's pregnancy, whether first, second, &c., and whether

she has had any previous still-born children.

" 6. Names, ages, and designations of the parents, and the date of their mar-

riage.

    " 7. Signature of the informant.

" 8. Date of registration and signature of Registrar.

" As to the age of the child, probably considerable difficulty v,-ould be experienced

in ascertaining this particular.                                                                                                                 The precise period of conception, and consequently
                                                                                                                                              _

of gestation, cannot be determined by the date of intercourse, and the real dura-

tion of pregnancy is, of course, the interval between conception and parturition.

In most cases, however, a sufficiently near approximation to the truth would pro-

bably be attained.

" As to the party who should sign the register as informant, this might be tlio

duty of the medical practitioner or other professional person in attendance ; and
where no such person was in attendance, the nearest female relative of the mother,

being of full age, present at the birth. Another course would be for the medical

attendant to transmit to the Registrar, as in the case of a death, on a form sup-

plied for the purpose, a certificate relative to the still-birth, the event beino- re-

corded under the provisions of the statute applicable to births generally (17 & 18

Vict. c. 80, § 27). In lieu of the extract furnished to the informant of a living

birth, in terms of the 37th section of the Registration Act, the Registrar should

be required to give a burial certificate, analogous to that furnished to the informant

of a death {Ibid. § 44). It is to be feared that imder the existing state of aii'airs,

many still-born children are interred not in cemeteries, but in back greens, water-

holes, quarries, and such like places, being treated as brute-beasts and not as hu-

man beings.

  "The ."ubject appears to be a very important one, and I humbly comnieiul the

suggestions which I have ventured to offer to the favoui-able consideration of

statists, philanthropists, and the medical profession."

bomchild  in wedlock ("pater est quern jiiiptice demonstrant^'), to tlie circumstances

under which the presumption may be overcome, and to the statements of Stair

and Erskine upon the subject, the author said :
   " The history of the law of legitimacy is fully detailed by Sir Harris Nicolas,

in his work on the ' Law of Adulterine Bastardy ;' while the present state of the

law is set forth in the works of several well-known authors, including the treatise
on the ' Evidence of Succession,' by Mr. Hubback (p. 393 et scq.), and the 'Law of

Evidence in Scotland,' by Mr. Gillespie Dickson (vol. i. p. 190 ct scq.).

" The usual groimd on which the presumption of legitimacy is overcome is the

non-access of the husband within the period of gestation. Actual proof of sucli

non-access is all that is now required both in England and Scotland; in other

words, it is no longer necessary to establish the physical impossibility of the hus-

band's access, by proving the intervention of the ' quatiwr maria.' According to

Mr. Hubback, the early writers (including Bracton and Fleta) recognize no such

doctrine as that of the quatuor 7naria ; and, accordingly, he asserts that ' the law

as now settled in its repudiation of this doctrine, is in conformity with the most
ancient authorities.' Even Lord Eldon remarked that the law had been scrupulous

about legitimacy, to the extent of (Usturbiiif/ the rules of reason.

presumption of legitimacy, under the operation of the Act relative to the Regis-

tration of Births, Deaths, and Mamages in Scotland (17 & 18 "S^ict. c. 80). The

form in which births require to be recorded is prescribed in Schedule (A) annexed

to that statute. The first column of the register embraces the '^Name and Sur-

name ' of the child, and the fom-th column the ' Name, surname, and rank or pro-

fession of the father,' the ' Name and maiden sm-name of the mother/ and the

' Date and place of marriage.'

" These latter particulars, of course, only apply to the case of legitimate children,

the entries applicable to illegitimate births being modified according to circum-

stances, and the word ' illegitimate ' being entered under the child's name in the

first column of the register.

" In the case of a le;/iti7nnte birth, the primary informant is one or other of the

whomchild's parents,  failing (in consequence of death, illness, or inability) certain

other specified persons. Such parent or other informant is required within twenty-

one days after the birth, and under a penalty of twenty shillings, ' to attend per-
sonally and give information to the Registrar of the parish or district in which the
birth occurred, to the best of his or her knotvlcdge and belief, of the several particulars
required to be registered touching such birth, and to sign the register in the pre-
sence of the Registrar.' As a general rule, the Registrar (whose duties are, of

course, purely ministerial) experiences no difficulty in recording the births reported

to him either as legitimate or illegitimate, according to the statement of the infor-

mant. Sometimes, however, a doubtful case presents itself, usually under the fol-
Alowing circumstances.
                        married woman attends at the Office of the Registrar,

and informs him that she has given birth to a child, of which, however, she

solemnly declares that her husband is not the father, adding that she has not had

any intercourse with him for a long period, perhaps two or three years ; at any
rate for upwards of nine or ten months prior to the birth of the child. It may be

that, during that time, the husband has been living at a distance from his wife, if

not residing out of the kingdom ; and possibly the paternity may be acknowledged

bv the paramour. She makes this statement, in the words of the statute already

refen-ed to, ' to the best of her knowledge and belief.' Laider such circumstances,

would the Registrar be entitled, in virtue of the legal presumption, to disregard

the statement of the mother, to record the child as legitimate, and to insist on the

mother signing the relative entry as informant? In other words, how are we to

reconcile the conflict between the legal presumption in favour of the child's legiti-

macy with the mother's deliberate assertion to the conti-ary ? The ordinary prac-

tice of the Registrar General is to send a printed schedule to the Registrar who

reports a birth occurring under such circumstances, of which the following is a

copy :--

   " The directions as to the form of the relative entry depend, of course, upon the

answers supplied; but in the majority of the cases submitted for consideration,
where the statement clearly indicates the impossibility of the husband being the
father, the child is described, in the first column of the Register, by its mother's
maiden and married surnames alternately, without the addition of the word ' ille-

gitimate,' while in column four, the name of the husband, and the date and place

--of marriage are omitted, and the mother thus described : ' Mary Brown, wife of

David Wilson, shoemaker, wlio she (the informant) declares is not the father of the
child, and further that she has not seen her husband for upwards of (say) two
years.' Such an entry, no doubt, affords prima facie evidence of the child's ille-
gitimacy, and at a distant period it would probaljly be somewhat difficult to over-

come the presumption. On the other hand, however, the circumstantial statement
in column 4 distinctly shows that the child was born in wedlock, its alleged illegi-
timacy being registered on the information of its own mother ; and such informa-

tion being tendered ' to the best of her knowledge and belief.' If, however, the
circumstances are such as to indicate opportunity of access to the husband, or
otherwise suggest a presumption in favour of the child's legitimacy, the Registrar
is instructed to record the birth as legitimate in the ordinary way, even in the face
of the mother's assertion to the contrary ; and if the husband, or any other in-
terested party, should feel aggrieved by the form of the entry, he is, of course,
entitled to take steps for its correction, in terms of the statutory provisions."

   * As a general rule, most of the information will be furnished by the child's mother.

        0)1 Indian Statistics and Official Reports. By Dr. Geoege Smith.

    The eight years' administration of the Marquis of Dalhousie^ which closed in
 1856, was the beginning of intellectual progress in British India. On the conclu-
 sion of his splendid series of conquests, and even, to some extent, during their
 continuance, that distinguished Governor-General set in motion all those reforms
 which are involved in the railway, the telegraph, the anna or three-halfpenny
 postage, primary schools supported by a local cess, the Universities and the higher
 education, sucli scientific and political expeditions as Colonel Yvde's Mission to
 Ava, the Geological Survey, and such enlightened legislation as the Acts estab-
 lishing religious and civil toleration, and permitting the maniage of Hindoo
 widows. During his administration, when reviewing the Charter of the East India
 Company for the last time, Parliament directed, in 185-3, that Reports of the moral
 and material progress in India should be submitted to it every year. Each Pro-
 vince and each Department has since published an annual report, the whole num-
 bei'ing from eight to twelve.

    Led by professional duties to study these reports, and frequently to criticise them,
 the author was struck by the absence of uniformity and the meagreness of their
 statistical and economic information. The discussions caused by the Mutiny of
 1857 had sho'wn England the need of accurate information regarding India, and
 the annual Budgets, first introduced \)y the lamented James "Wilson in 1859, had
 convinced the Government of India of the necessity for statistical information as the
 basis of financial and political action. Still no reform was attempted till, in 186-3,
the author submitted to Mi\ S. Laing, then Indian Finance ^linister, a memorial and a
plan on the subject. The author adapted to India the scientific scheme of statistics,
published by the International Statistical Congress, which had sat not long before,
and recommended the appointment of a permanent committee of officials and non-

officials to advise Government on statistical questions. An attempt had previously

been made to establish a Statistical Society independently of Government, but that
had failed. On Mr. Laing's advice Lord Elgin was pleased to adopt the sugges-
tions, and to appoint what has since been known as the Calcutta Statistical Com-
mittee to carry them out.

   That Committee, working vigorously at first, divided the whole field among
small subcommittees. Mr. Bullen, a well-known merchant of Calcutta, adapted
the English Board of Trade tables, so that the Financial Department is now able
to publish detailed trade returns from the most distant parts of India everj* month,

and only a few weeks after the close of the period to which they refer. An annual

volume is also published. The difficult and complicated subject of the statistics
of revenue and expenditure was referred to Mr. E. H. Ilollingbers-, Assistant-
Secretary of the Financial Department, so that that department now publishes
annually an invaluable series ot three folio volumes, showing the past and present

statistics of Indian finance in great detail.

   The subject of administrative statistics, other than those of trade and finance, was
referred to the Hon. Mr. George Campbell, now the able Lieutenant-Governor of
Bengal, and to the author. The committee were pleased to adopt the author's plan,
adapted from that of the Statistical Congress, which, however, did not provide for
judicial statistics. Mr. Campbell, then a Judge of llie Bengal High Court, prepared
an admirable series of tables for that department, but the Government of India was
constrained to appoint a special conmiittec to deal with the courts of the other
Provinces as well as of Bengal. The result is that nothing satisfactory has yet
been done for judicial statistics, and no reliable uniform generalization can be
made regarding litigation, crime, and police in India. In all other respects, how-
ever, the statistical forms seem to be perfect. The administrative tables were
refeiTed to the Provincial Governments, and, after undergoing searching and some-
times hostile criticism, because they seemed to interfere with local arrangements
and to demand an establishment of clerks, they were finally approved of by the
Government of India and the Secretary of State in 1867. That is, each of the ten
Provinces which send in annual administration reports, was ordered to report on
the basis of these unifomi and scientific tables. Since 1867-68 all have obeyed,

--except the three most important Bengal proper, Madras and Bombay. The fii-st,

Owing to the perpetual settlement of its land revenue and the absence of a link of

orticials between our civilians and the people, has always been statistically unsatis-

fiictory ; but we may depend on Mr. Campbell introducing the reform there also, so
far as possible. No countries in the world possess such rich statistical material,

which could be made easily available, as Madras and Bombay. But the Reports of

the latter are the worst in India. It is to bo hoped that the Government of India

will see that its orders are carried out so as to work these Provinces into the

--uniform statistical system. That system is as follows in its main heads : (A)

Statistics of Pliysical, Political, and Fiscal Geography. (B) Statistics of Protec-

tion. (C) Statistics of Production and Distribution. (D) Statistics of Instruc-

tion. (E) Statistics of Life. The tables are meant to include all the 153 Feu-

datory States ; but except in those cases where a minority has put the State under

direct British management, the Chiefs as a rule passively resist all attempts to

obtain statistical information regarding their estates and revenues.

Still the reform thus wrought by the Calcutta Statistical Committee has been

immense. To say nothing of the elaborate periodical statistics of trade and finance,

there are published in India every year, about August, some ten volumes on the

ten Provinces of India, and seven of these volumes contain uniform scientific tables.

It has tlius been possible, dm-ing the last three years, to obtain an almost complete

picture of tlie progress and condition of the 212 millions of Hindoos, Mussulmans,

Boodhists, Christians, Non-Aryans, Parsees and Jews whom we rule, and for whom

England is responsible, in Southern Asia.

The greatest statistical want of India is now a uniform census of the whole

population. Until recently, as still in the three gTeat Provinces of Bengal, Madras

and Bombay, the number of the population was arrived at by multiplying the

number of houses by five, and this duty was entrusted to an uneducated police.

But of late much more carefid enumerations of the people have been made, showing

tliat on the night of the 10th January, 1865, there were 30,006,068 in the Nortli-

Western Provinces ; tliat in 1866 there were 9,008,103 in the Central Provinces

that in 1868 there were 17,611,408 in the Punjab ; that in 1809 there were

11,232,368 in Oudh ; that in 1867 there were 2,220,074 in Berar ; and that in 1809

tliere were 2,395,988 in British Burma. Assuming the correctness of the Parlia-

mentary return of the population of non-feudatory India, England rules 212,671,621

people in ton Provinces, containing 221 districts or counties, and in 163 states,

covering an area of 1,577,698 square miles. The density ranges from 474 per

square mile in Oudh to 20 in British Bm-ma. Over aU India it is 135, in feudatory

India alone it is 80.

Besides the Annual Administration Reports, the Government of India, the ten

Provincial Administrations, and the great Departments issue frequent Reports, some

AUof them of the liighest value.  may be consulted in the garrets to whicli the

India Office in Westminster banishes its fine Library and Museum, as well as the

woekl}' reports on the nati^e press, and a copy of every work published in India

and registered under the Literature Act. But the Government of India is most

liberal in distributing its reports. If any great Association or Library desires a copy of

each as it appears in India, an agent should be appointed for its reception in Calcutta.

Before the late ]Mr. Ilalkett's death the author had the satisfaction of obtaining

from Lord Mayo's Government a promise to present a copy of everj' Report to the

Advocates Library of Edinburgh. The Government of India has everything to gain

from the widest publicity. The Reports of its great Surveys and of the settlement

of the land revenue of every district out of Bengal, are mines of valuable infor-

mation regarding tlie country and the people. Much of this is being utilized in

the Gazetteers which are being prepared in every Province.

  A Director of Indian Statistics has recently been appointed by Lord Mayo, and a

Census of all India is about to be made.

On ihe Scientific Asjjects of Children's Hospitals. By "William Stephenson,

   M.B., F.B.C.S. Ed., Phi/s. to Roy. Hosj). for iSicJc Children, Edinburgh.

  A peculiarity of Medical Charities is that theyyoxist not only as benevolent iu-

stitutions, but occupy a very important position as fields for scientific inquiiT, and
as means for increasing and diffusing medical knowledge. This double nature
brings them directly under the recognition of a scientific association such aa this,

--whose great aim is to develope the high function of science the promotion of the

welfare of mankind. Some details regarding the Royal Hospital for Sick Children

were given. It contains 74 beds, 32 for ordinary patients and 42 for fever cases.
There is also an outdoor or dispensary department. The patients have likewise

--the benefit of the Convalescent House at Corstorphiue. No letters of introduction

are required the doors are open to aU who are sick and young. The liability to
abuse which this peculiarity gives rise to was pointed out, and how it lets in the

evil of indiscriminate charity.

    Important as is the question of the proper administi-ation of charity, it is the
scientific economy of the subject which falls more directly under the recognition of

this Association. As charities, om- hospitals for children have ah-eady reached a

full maturity, as scientific centres their development is still imperfect and stunted.
   The scientific requirements prove the necessity for children's hospitals as sepa-

rate establishments. To an-ive at any important clinical results, requires the
grouping together of large numbers of cases, such as only can be done in hospitals
of considerable size. They must be also imder the care" of able men, who should
be enabled to devote a large share of their time to the special work. In both these

respects the progress of medical science is stiU greatly retarded in this country.

Our children's hospitals are too small, and in London the tendency at present is to
multiply the number, rather than increase the size of those already existing, to the

proportion commensurate with the requirements of science. Much may be said in

favour of small (/eneral hospitals, but there already exist the necessary'large insti-
tutions of this kind, and were these divided, science would sufler in proportion to
the subdivision.

   On the Continent children's hospitals bave for years existed on a scale which it
is hopeless ever to expect in this country. But it' is to them we are indebted for
much of om* present knowledge of infantile pathologv' ; Jind on this accoimt our

ideas still bear a foreign stamp, which does not prepare us for the modifications which
climate, mode of life, and national differences produce in the natm-e of disease.

   One of the great objects in establishing the Children's Hospital was to meet the
want in the Edinburgh Medical School of proper " appliances for aflbrding sub-
stantial assistance and practical instruction in the diseases of children."' That
defect has been supplied ; the public has nobly done its share in the work, and
regular instruction is now given to the students who avail themselves of the oppor-
tunity. But at the same time no advance has yet been made by our Universities
or Licensing Boards of the country to give that recognition to the subject, without
whicb the resources tbus supplied must remain very partially taken advantage of
by oui- students. It is an anomalous fact that medical men obtain their diplomas,
and go forth to practise, without having received any special instruction in that
department of their profession which is to foi-m two thirds of theii- patients, and
"which relates to the causes which are producing the greatest mortality in the
country. Special instruction in the physiological, pathological, and clinical pecu-
liarities of childhood holds no real place in the cm-riculum of study assigned to
medical students, and they pass from our schools ignorant of the simplest points of
infantile hygiene, or the character of the most important constitutional afl'ections.

   This constitutes the gi-eat barrier which exists to the full development of one of

the gi-eat objects which have called our children's hospitals into existence. By the
removal of it alone can we expect to combat with gi-eater success, with the widely

spread, the far reaching in point of time, and giievously fatal influences, which

strike sorrow into our hearts, and carry suff'ering to those who are dearest and most

dependent upon us.

On the Manual Labour Classes of England, Wales, and Scotland.
                          By W. Tatlee, F.S.S.

            On Census Beform. By James Valentine, of Aberdeen.

   The object of this paper was to advocate the more frequent taking of the census
of the people, and some changes therein, especially in the case of large towns, in
order more particularly to ensure a broad and sound basis for our vital statistics.

   The author suggested that the following arrangements should be adopted :

  A1. census, confined perhaps to the numbers of the people, the sexes, the ages on

the classification of the Kegistrar-General's Vital Statistics--under 5, 5-20, 20-60,
GO and above ; and perhaps thft numbers at work and at school respectively should
be taken every year, or every two years.

   2. The census should be taken under the superintendence of local authorities
(say town councils), acting with imperial sanction and at local expense.

   3. As to the mode of carrying out the plan, cards might be delivered to every
household a week or two before the census-day (say, by the letter-carriers, with

some assistance, if necessary) ; and the citizens should be required to attend at di-
strict recording places, and give in these cards, properly filled up, to one or more
sworn officers, appointed to receive them. Those unable to fill up the card might
give the particulars viva voce ; or the whole census might be taken and recorded

in this way.
   4. Each district might be a town parish, and there should be manageable blocks

or subdivisions, marked out so that the population and other census particulars of
each be distinctly recorded.

   6. For providing other particulars, of what the author called sanitary geography,
as regards the dwelling-houses there should be a surveyor, with access to the valua-
tion roll ; and the medical officer of the place would find in this province profitable

use for his services in various ways.

   6. The figures, on being summed and duly authenticated, would be transmitted

to the Registrar-General, and the results adopted by him.
   7. There should, however, be a local publication of detailed particulars, popularly

stated, and full publicity given to it.
   Should this machmery appear at first sight too elaborate, the present system,

cumbrous and unsatisfactory in several respects as it is, might be continued, but
with a quinquennial instead of a decennial census, and annual returns procured by
some simple machinery made, showing the exact population of a place, with the
ages at four periods of life ; or, again, to reduce the reform to a minimum, the pro-
posed change might apply to towns only, though there is no difficulty about ascer-
taining the population of a country parish, and it is better to have strict accuracy.

        On the Organization of Societies, nationally and locally considered.

                        By R. Bailey "Walker, Manchester.

 --The object of this paper was 1, to show the ineffectiveness of the present system

of separate societary organization ; 2, to suggest an elementary step in the direction
of further or inter-societaxj organization, and to show its national and local appli-

cation ; 3, to contrast the economy of positive, and the wastefulness of negative
(opposition) work, and therefore to urge work of a positive character only, as being

consistent with a right understanding of social economics.

                On the Law of Capital. By William "Westgaeth,

   In bringing up this contentious and oft-told tale of capital once more, the author
said, by way of excuse, that he would try to make it thoroughly practical, and one
from the merchant's view rather than that of the S3'steraatic economist. The awful
accoimts just being received of the effects of famine in Persia show the importance
of capital to any country. Such sudden and frightful misery coidd not occur in
224 REPORT--1871.

presence of large capital, simply l)ecanse capital consists to a large extent of those

requisites of life that make our daily food. Hence the importance, for <auy such

emergency, that a country have a large instead of a small capital, that it carry on

its business with a large instead of a siuaU cui-rent balance of all the things dealt

in. The object of the paper is to set forth the causes by which capital arises and

increases or decreases in a country, to set forth, in short, the law of capital.

In speaking of Persia, it will be said at once that an element of political or

social insecurit)' readily accounts for a permanently small capital. That is both

true and obvious, and therefore the author confined himself to countries that are, in a

general way, of equal civilization and security, in order that our law of capital may

more clearly show itself. Take then most of the European States, and average

them respectively in their soils, forests, mines, in their respective climates. Their

industry is all thoroughly organized, and the respective governments, although

politically unlike, may be assumed as equally protective of the private rights "of

property. They seem thus fairly matched for the commercial race, and yet they

arrive at very different results, for some have come to much greater wealth than

others. Our own country in particular has reached a surpassing position in this

respect, with capital ever overflowing to make up the deficiencies of its neigh-

bours.

When we ask for the causes of this in countries that, as we saw, appeared so

equally balanced in the substantials of the race, we shall find one dissimilar con-

dition that has not been alluded to, namely, the mode of a country's industry or

trading. It is of a more aggregative or wholesale character in one country than

another. As matter of fact, we can perceive that the more aggregative industries

carry with them the largest capitals, and our business now is to inquire how this

Howis so.  does capital arise, how maintain itself, how increase or diminish ?

There is no need at this time of daj- to explain the economic doctrine of the sub-

division of labour, by which industry is made more productive. That is ostensibly

and mainly a question of the law of production ; but the author deals with the part of

the subject that has to do with the law of capital. Let us for a moment go bade

to that primitivism that must have preceded subdivision of labour amongst early

mankind generalh', and that still lingers amongst existing barbarism. There is no
trading in that social condition. The family, with its fitful industry and its few

wants, works only for itself. The only property such a society can have is the
home or the homestead of each family, whatever these may be like. There is no

exchanging and no exchangeable property, no capital in the commercial sense.

   From this isolative aspect of industrial life let us turn to the other, with which
we are more familiar. With advancing civilization society has lapsed or drifted of

itself into labour-subdivision, from a practical perception that its labour-power is

thus turned to better account. Let us follow this arrangement and note how a

fund or capital, that had no previous existence, arises out of it. AVhere the family
no longer supplies directly its own wants, but is occupied in each case over only

one or a few of society's many various requirements, there comes concurrently, of

course, a system of mutual exchange of products. The difierent households of a
town or district fall in this way into intertrading, and by extension of the same

principle the trading extends by degrees to adjacent commvmities, to adjacent

countries, and to the world in general. But all this trading requires a trade-appa-

ratus. When the families of a community begin to intertrade, each requires some

little stock on hand, according to its extent of custom ; others need a factory, or a
warehouse, or a shop, and a stock in trade is piled up, according to the wants of

each case. When one community trades with another the aggregation of industry

and its wholesale dispositions are still more marked, and all tlie stoclcs and other

apparatus of iutertracling are on a proportionately greater scale. There are roads
and railways for the inland, and ships for the 'sea-transportations, and greater
stocks and machinery and agency everywhere.

 AU_ this may be called the trading expenses. They constitute, indeed, an expen-

sive accompaniment, which would not be willingly maintained by traders, were it
not essential to the kind of trade they carry on, and were it not paid for, and some-
thing more, by tlie progressive economy of production accompanying every such

8tep in this aggregative or wholesale direction of industry. This, then, is our
       TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.      225

law of capital, that the concurrent apparatus of trade is great in proportion to the
aggregative or wholesale tendencies of a country's indu'tiy, and that every coun-

try's capital is substantially this apparatus of its trading.

   To enable any country to attain the condition of relatively large capital, its
industry must be left as free as possible to take those aggregative forms into which

it is ever naturally impelled by the greater productive results, or, in plainer lan-
guage, by the larger profits. But here the realities of things present constant
obstacles, which keep, and possibly ever will keep, some countries poor in capital

and others rich, although we cannot doubt that each and all would prefer to be
countries of large means. Even granting that the industrial tendencies and spirit of
enterprise are equal and alike in the more advanced coimtries, a proposition, how-
ever, which we hardly dare affirm, yet in various other respects those forms of
trading which result in a large capital, are checked and thwarted by the countries
themselves, now by their revenue necessities requiring import duties with their
trade-restrictive effect, and again by the prejudices and en-ors of those coimtries in
misdirecting industry by making these duties protective of home industry. To
foster home industry at the expense of foreign trade is to restrict the aggregative
tendencies of industry, and concurrently, as we have seen, to reduce the require-
ment or capacity of a country for capital. To "protect" the home industry in

addition, is to impoverish the country in its productive power. There is thus the
double disadvantage of a diminished productive power, and a reduced amount of
that concm-rent balance on hand that is regulated more or less by the form of the

trading.

   The author has not encumbered his argument with the consideration of what is

called "fixed capital." He has hitherto been treating of "floating capital," while

a country's capital consists of both. The fixed portion is less amenable to the law
indicated than the other kind ; but inasmuch as the amounts that are ever passing
into fixed capital, that is, into permanent investments, depend mainly on the effec-
tiveness of industiy in supphdng the means, and as this depends on the aggregative
and wholesale tendencies, the connexion of all capital is thus more or less direct
with the law iu question.

   In all the foregoing the question is treated on purely business principles, and
society regarded as one individual interest, which makes more or less of income at
the year's end, and has more or less of concurrent capital all along, according to the
form of trading. The social question is of course different, and it takes society to

pieces to ascertain how its many individual components fare comparatively under these
trading forms. The author did not go into this latter question further than to acknow-

ledge that the social by no means follows always the merely economic well-being.
Nevertheless it is of the very highest importance that the economic laws be clearly
imderstood, and that in withstanding their natural tendency, or, in plainer words, in
resisting more or less the course of free trade, a country is accepting a positive mate-
rial disadvantage as the concurrent price or penalty of whatever it is aiming at

socially. When the judgment is thus enlightened protective intervention will

always be the very rare exception, and only under the strictest and most special
discrimination as to what is protected. This would be altogether a difierent pro-

cedure from that blind and indiscriminate protective system with which so many

countries still injure themselves, alike by reducing their industrial power and
diminishing that concurrent capital requirement or capacity, which keeps a country

full-handed in resom'ces.

       MECHANICAL SCIENCE.

--I^ADIKS AND Gentlemen", -In addressing you on the subject of mechanical

science in our ancient university, I propose to speak oa the somewhat threadbare

topic of technical instruction. The panic with wliich some persons regarded the

rapid improvement made abroad in manufactures has subsided ; but I hope that you

vn\l be all the more ready on that account to listen to a few suggestions as to st'-ps

which may be immediately taken to improve the education of those who apply

science to practical ends. "The subject does not owe its prominence to any events

of to-day or of yesterday ; it has long been, and will long be, of paramount im-

portance to this country that the education of the producers of wealth should be

such as will enable them not merely to compete on advantageous terms -with
forei oners, but rather to master the great forces of nature by which we work. That
we have gained some triumphs can be no reason for relaxing our efforts. With

each advance further advance becomes more difficult, and requires more knowledge

the tirst rude implements and processes employed by man certainly required for

tlieir explanation or acquirement no book-learning, but as processes become com-
plex and implements develope into machines, as the occupations of men dift'er more

and more, practice alone is found insufficient to give skill, and study becomes the

necessary preparation for all successful work. Our first engineers were not learned

men                         strong good sense and long practice enabled them  to overcome the compara-
                      ;

tively simple questions with which they dealt. All honour to those great men ; but

we who have to deal with more complex, if not with vaster problems, cannot trust

to good sense alone, even if we possess it, but must arm om-selves by the study of

science and its application to the arts. This being granted, how shall it be done ?

I need not trouble you by refuting the absiu-dities of a few men who would have
those things taught at schools which have hitherto been taught by practice. What

has been taught by practice must still be taught by practice. The business of the

--school is to teach those things which practice in an art wiU not teach a man. Let

us apply this principle to engineering the most scientific of all professions. It

will be most useless to lecture on filing and chipping ; it will be useless to describe

the mere forms and arrangements of vast multitudes of machines ; one kind of

knowledge of tlie properties of materials can only be acquired, as it always has been

acquired, by actually handling them ; and the knowledge of the arrangement of a
machine is far better learnt by mere inspection than from fifty lectures ; moreover,
it can be acquired by an intelligent man even if he be wholly imlettered. Book-

learning about estimates, the value of goods, methods of superintending work, and

dealing with men is foohshness. AVritten descriptions of puddling a cl.ay embank-

ment, excavating, and such operations, give no knowledge ; and j'et a vast mass of

such knowledge must at some time of his life be acquired by the engineer, and the

student cannot be employed as an engineer until he has laid up a store of such know-

ledge. Colleges cannot give him this he must serve an apprenticeship in fact if
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

not in form. Young foreigners taught in colleges serve their apprenticeship, at the

Wecost of their employers, during the first few years of their professional life.            call

the tjTO an apprentice or pupil, and he pays his master instead of being paid by

him. I have the strongest feeling against any attempt to substitute collegiate

teaching for practical apprenticeship. So far as colleges attempt to teach practice

they are and will be a sham in this country and in all others. The work of a col-

lege is to teach those sciences which are applied in the arts, but it can go a little

further and indicate to its students how the application is made in at least a few

selected instances. Applying this dictum to the education of an engineer, his col-

lege can teach him mathematics, natural philosophy, chemistry, and geology. No

one can doubt that a j-outli well trained in these branches of knowledge will, even

with no further teaching, learn more during his apprenticeship, and during his

whole professional life will take a higher standing than the man of equal intelli-

gence imtrained in science. College can, however, do more than this ; it is found

that a lad will go through a considerable number of books of Euchd, and yet see so

dimly how his knowledge is to be connected with practice that he may be unable

even to compute the area of a field, the dimensions of which are well known to

him                         and far more is it seen that  a man may be  fairly grounded  in  mathematics,
                         ;

and yet have very little idea how to apply his knowledge to mechanical problems.

It is the business of those who hold such chairs as mine to point out the connexion

between pure science and practice, to show how mathematics are employed in men-

suration and in mechanical calculations, to show how the truths of physics are made

use of in "designing economical machinery, as when we teach the connexion betv,-eeu
             TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                  237

the laws of lieat and the steam-engine. The student wlio has once grasped the fact

tliat there is a real connexion between practice and theory will seldom be at a los s

how to find or search for that connexion in after life. The student thus prepared

knows what he has to learn from practice, and need not lose precious tune in blun-

dering over the numberless scientific problems which practice is sure to suggest but

can ne-ver solve. The education of the architect, the practical chemist, the manu-

facturer, and the merchant must be similar, mutatis midandis, with that of the en-

gineer. Assuming then that the education of those who are to follow more or less

scientific pursuits must consist in acquiring, first, that theoretical knowledge which

practice cannot give, and, secondly, the practical knowledge which schools should

not attempt to give, there remains the question whether the theoretical preparation

shoidd be given in special colleges or universities such as our own. I have no hesi-

tation in preferring the university. Mathematics, physics, chemistry, geology,

botany, languages, all form elements required in various combinations in the educa-

tion of all our students. There is but one kind of mathematics, one kind of pure

physics, and so forth. Surely it is better that we should teach the men belonging

to different professions side by side, so long as the matter taught is to be the same.

There are many dangers in an opposite course. There are not a sufficient number

of competent teachers to allow of much difl'erentiation. Segregation at an early

age is apt to foster professional peculiarities and narrow-mindedness. There is great

danger, if physics are to be taught specially to engineers, that a special kind of

physics, erroneously supposed to be specially useful to them, wiU be invented.

Lastly, the contact of students and professors of one faculty Avith the students and

Doprofessors of other faculties is very beneficial to all.  not, therefore, cripple old

universities by withdra-ndng fi-om them a portion of their students and their pro-

fessors, to set up special professional or technical colleges of a novel kind, but rather

add by degrees to the power and usefulness of old institutions, and found new col-

leges and universities after the model of those which are found to have done good

work. As an example of what may be safely done, I consider that in Edinburgh

we require a chair of architecture and lectm-eships on navigation and on telegraphy.

There is, further, much want of a teacher of mechanical drawing. The professors
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        _

of physics and chemistry require additional accommodation for practical laboratories,

and additional assistance. If these additions were made our college would, in mj'-

opinion, meet all the requirements for superior technical education in this part of

Scotland. For £2000 per annum all these additions might be made. Notwith-

standing the acknowledged importance of education, establishments for giving the

higher kinds of instruction are never self-supporting, and students must everywhere

be bribed to come and learn. Immediate prizes, in the form of bursaries, scholar-

ships, and fellowships, are required to induce men to cultivate the older fields of

learning ; and similar bribes are needed to promote the tillage of the more recently

colonized domains of apphed science. The Whitworth scholarships are a noble

example of munificence thus directed, although, in my opinion, the examination

requires considerable reform. I hope that further benefits of this kind will be con-

ferred on those colleges which give efficient teaching. Local ambition is most ef-
fectuallv stirred by local prizes ; and I regret to find a certain apathy among

students here with respect to the Whitworth competition. This appears to arise

partly from dissatisfaction with the mode of examination, and partly from the fact

that the examiners are men not well known in Scotland. Leaving the question of

technical training for the upper classes, and the still larger question of scientific

teaching in second-grade schools, the consideration of which woidd lead us too far

a-field, T propose to say a few words on the technical education of the skilled arti-

san. This we must treat on the same principles as have been applied to professional

Weteaching.  must endeavour to prepare the lad in school by teaching him those

things which he cannot learn in workshops, but which will enable him to woric with

greater intelligence while acquiring and applying his practical knowledge. I shall

not now speak of that general education which should make him a good man, and
which should open to him those gi'eat sources of rational enjoyment arising from

culture ; I will restrict myself entirely to his preparation for becoming an efficient

workman. I have in many places said, and I cannot say too often, that the great

want of the workman is a knowledge of mechanical drawing. Unfortunately I can
                                                                                                15*

obtain little attention from the general public to tbis demand for tlie workman.

Very few persons not being engineers know at all wliat mechanical drawing- is. I
am sorry to say that some examiners in high places, who direct the education of

the country, know very little more than the creneral public, and teachers wlio should

give bread give chaff. I have lived much abroad, and come into close contact both

with English and foreign workmen, and 1 unhesitatingly say that the chief, if not

the only inferiority of Englishmen has been in this one branch of knowledge. I

must explain to some of my hearers what meclianical drawing is. It is the art of

representing any object so accurately that a skilled workman, upon inspecting the

drawing, shall be able to make the object of exactly the materials and dimensions

shown without any further verbal or wiitten instruction from the designer. The

objects represented may be machines, implements, buildings, utensils, or ornaments.
They may be constructed of every material. The drawings miLj be linear, shaded

and colom-ed, or plain. They must necessarily be drawn to scale ; but various geo-
metrical methods may be employed. The uame of mechanical drawing is given to

one and all those representations the object of which is to enable the thing drawn

to be made by a workman. Artistic drawing aims at representing agreeably, and

for the sake of the representation something already in existence, or which might

exist. Mechanical drawing aims at representing the object, not for the sake

of tlio representation, but in order to facilitate the production of the thing repre-

sented.

  Now I say that it is this latter kind of drawing that is so vastly important to

our artisans, and hence to our wealth-produciug population. Very few workmen
or men of any class can hope to acquire such excellence in artistic drawing that

their productions will give pleasure to themselves and others ; but a great number
of workmen must acquire some kiiowledge of the drawings of those things

which they produce, and there is not one skilled workman who would not be

better qualified bj^ a knowledge of mechanical drawing to do his work with ease

to himself and benefit to the public. Mechanical drawing is a rudimentary acquire-

ment of the nature of reading, writing, and arithmetic. In order that a man mav

imderstaud the illustrated description of a machiue he must understand this kind
of drawing. To the general public an engineering drawing is as unintelligible as a

printed book is to a man who cannot read. The general public can no more put

their ideas into such a shape that workmen can carry them out than persons igno-

rant of writing can convey their meaning on paper. Reading and writing on me-

chanical or industrial subjects is impossible without some knowledge of the art I am

pressing on j-our attention. This art is taught abroad in every industrial school;

a great part of the school time is given up to it. In a Prussian industrial school

Aone third of tlie wliole time is given to it.                                                  French commission on technical

education reported that drawing, with all its applications to tlie diflerent industrial

arts, should bs considered as the principal means to bj employed in technical

education. Now, I deliberately state that this subject is not taught at all in En-

gland, and that the ignorance of it is so givat that t can obtain no attention to niv
Acomplaints.
       _                                                     hundred times more money is spent by Government to encourage

artistic drawing than is given to encourage mechanical drawing, and I say that

mechanical drawing is a hundred times more important to us as a nation. Moreover,

the little f/uasi mechanical drawing which is taught is mostly mere geometrical

projection, a subject of which real draughtsmen very frequently, and with little

loss to themselves, are profoundly ignorant. Descriptive geometrv and geometrical

projection are nearly useless branches of the art, and the little enco'uragement which

is given is almost nionopolized by these. Mechanical drawing proper is confined

to those who pick it up by practice in engineering oilices. These draughtsmen are

often  excellent                                             and  on  their behoof I claim  no  other teaching.  I speak for the

artisan who makes and for him who uses machinery.

   There are two ways in which our shortcomings may be remedied: first, the
schools of art now established in this country should be enlarged so as to teach

real mechanical drawing, and the examinations conducted by tlie Science and Art
Department should be greatly modified ; secondly, the drawing which is to be

taught in the schools under the superintendence of the new school boards mav be,

and ought to be, mechanical drawing. Freehand drawing as a branch of primary

education will, I fear, be a useless pastime ; but whether that be so or not, I am

certain that the accurate and neat representation of the elementary parts of
machinery and buildings would be popidar with the pupils and could be efiectively

taught. This kind of drawing educates hand and mind in accuracy, it teaches the

students the elements of mensuration and geometry, and it affords considerable

scope for taste where taste exists. The chief difficulty will be to obtain competent

teachers. I should occupy you too long were I to attempt to show how these

Mymust themselves be trained.  chief aim to-day has been to claim attention

for a most important and wholly neglected branch of education.

   I shall probably be expected to urge the teaching of other natural sciences in our

primary schools ; nothing, indeed, would give me gi-eater pleasure than to think

this coukl be done. I confess I doubt it ; while our second-grade schools are what

they are in this respect, and while the Cambridge examination for a degree in

applied science is what it is, I dare not think of natural-science classes in our

primary schools. I shall be delighted if I am mistaken ; but I am certain that

mechanical drawing deserves our tirst attention, as most immediately useful to the
artisan and most easily taught. The very books on natm-al science which are pub-

lished in England cannot be properly illustrated for want of a sufficient number

of competent draughtsmen ; and ' children would be unable to follow the illus-

trations and diagrams if ignorant of the principles on which they are constructed.

I look rather to good reading-books, explained by intelligent masters, as the best

manner of teaching the elementary and all-important truths of natural science.

No man could do better service than in compiling such reading-books, and there

are few wants more urgent than that of masters competent to enlarge upon texts

which would thus be put into their hands. The education of our worlonen is far

more incomplete than that of our professional men. Small additions to existing

institutions will meet the want of the latter ; but for the former the institutions

have to be erected almost from the foundation.

        On an Apparatus for ivorTcing Toi-pedoes. By Philip Beaham.

    The author of this paper described the various modes of working with torpedoes

now extant, and explained their various disadvantages. He then explained his

own, which was the propulsion of a torpedo from an invulnerable boat below its

Awater-line by means of the expansion of compressed air. drawing of the appara-

tus was exhibited by the author ; it consisted of a compression-chamber, in which
air could be confined to a great pressure, a tube through which the torpedo could
be propelled, and a valve arrangement whereby the progressive velocity of the

torpedo could be regulated. By means of machinery driven from the engines that
move the ship he proposed to compress air into the compression-chamber to 500 lbs.
to the square inch, and when within striking-distance of the vessel attacked the air

to be suffered to escape behind the shaft of the toi-pedo, driving it with consider-
able force so as to strike the vessel attacked below its water-line and then to explode.

By the reaction of the force driving the torpedo forwards, whose average statical

pressure would be So tons on a diameter of 1-9 shown, the author expects the
attacking boat would have its speed considerably diminished, if not entirely neu-
tralized, and so prevent the possibility of collision.

Account of some Experiments iipon a " Carres Disintegrator " at ivoric at

 Messrs. Gibson and Walker's Flow-mills, Leith. By F. J. Beamwell, O.E.

   CaiT's Disintegrator, as is probably well known to most mechanical engineers,
consists e.'=sentially of two disks, eacli tixed upon a horizontal shaft. These shafts
are placed in one line ; the disks which they carry at their ends are separated the
one fi-om the other by a space of a few inches. Each disk carries a number of bars

or studs disposed in several concentiic rings, and standing out at right angles from
its face. The concentric rings of studs of the one disk are arranged so as to be in
the spaces between the concentric rings of the other disk. The disks are driven in
opposite directions, and at a high velocity. The rings of studs, although very
230 REPORT--1871.

numerous, do not reach to the centre of the machine ; this part is unoccupied by studs,
and acts as an " eye " to receive the feed. The first two or three rings ot studs,

heginning- at the centre, are fixed to one of the disks only, viz. the one opposite to

that through which the feed enters, and they serve to distribute that feed equably

throughout the machine. So soon as the material has, however, passed by cen-
trifugal force beyond the limit of the outermost of these central or " eye "-

rings, it is met by the first of the rings moving in the opposite direction. The

studs of this ring find the material while in mid air and moving in a direction
opposite to their own motion, and with a velocity due to the circumferential speed

of the ring of studs the material has just qmtted. The result of this meeting ia

clearly, first a violent blow, and then a reversal of motion, by which the whole of

the material is sent flying through the air in a "direction contrary to that which it

last had, and with a velocity increased by the increased circumference of the ring

of studs which has just put it into motion, a velocity and a direction, however, to

be aU but instantly arrested and reversed by the action of the next ring of studs,

and so the material proceeds from ring to ring until it is delivered, completely pul-

verized, at the circumference of the machine. It will have been gathered from

this description tliat a Carr's Disintegi-ator acts to reduce material upon a prin-

ciple wholly different to those principles upon- which millstones, edge-ruuners,

crushing-rolls, rumblers, and stampers act ; in fact, so far as the writer of this

paper is aware, upon a principle which had never been applied to a similar or even

to an analogous purpose, and that principle is the breakmg up of the material by

the action of a force which has no other abutment, if the term may be used, than
the momentum of the material itself. In fact the material is treated as a shuttle-

cock, to be bandied backwards and forwards between mechanical battledores,

Suffering breakage at each blow until it is reduced to the required condition of

pulverization.

The proportions of the machine and the size of the spikes or studs are varied to

suit the material to be operated upon.

   The particidar machine upon which the experiments (the subject of this paper)
were made is used for converting wheat into flour. It is about 7 feet diameter,
and has a space of 10 inches between the faces of the two disks. The disk
on the feed side carries six concentric rings of studs, which work between

six concentric rings on the opposite disk. This opposite disk has also three

" eye "-rings. The studs are circular, half au inch in diameter, and made of

crucible steel. The distance fi-om centre to centre of the studs is 2^ inches,

and from ceuti-e to centre of the rings also 2^ inches, so that there is a clear

space both circimiferentially and radially of 2 inches between the studs. The re-

volving disks are enclosed in a casing, at the bottom of which there is an ordinary

creeper or screw to convey away the meal produced ; and as now very commonly

appUed to the cases of millstones, there is an exhaust-pipe connected with an

exhaust-fan, to remove the dust and convey it to a depositing chamber, the " stive "

room. The machine is driven from a counter shaft by means of two sh-aps, one

open, the other crossed, so as to give motion in opposite du-ections to the two

disks. Their ordinary working speed is about 400 revolutions per minute.

  By the gi-eat courtesy of Messrs, Gibson and Walker, and with the able assist-

ance of theii- engineer, Mr. Watson, the ^^liter and Mi: Edward Easton wci-e

enabled to make the following experiments to test the power required to drive this
machme imder varying circimistances. In arranging the programme of these ex-

periments, the writer was particulaiiv desirous of ascertaining whether or not a

siispicion he entertained as to a source of consumption of power in the working of

the machine was justified by the facts. Frotn a consideration of tJie number of

times the disks revolve in a minute, and of the number of rings of studs, it is clear
there must be many thousand settings into motion, and reversals of those motions,
per mmute of any material within the action of the disks ; and it occurred to the
writer that although the air within the zone of action of the machine weighed only
between 30 and 40 omices, yet even that trifling weight could not be subjected to

such treatment without the  consumption of a very  considerable amount of power.

tlie power when working without feed in an abnormal manner, viz. with both the

their results may be tabulated as follows :

From this Table it will be seen that when the machine'is worldng abnormally, it

only requires 19 horse-power to drive it, this power being employed in overcoming

the friction of the journals &c., and in driving the disks while acting on the air,

after the manner of an ordinary fan. Directly, however, the machine is piit to
work in its normal way, so as to deal with the air by repeated reversals, the power

mounts up to G3-horse. It will also be seen that to make 1-j quarters of wheat

into flom' reqiures 60 horse-power more than to work the machine when acting

upon air alone, or at the rate of 20 horse-power for each 5 quarters of wheat, a rate

that is very fairly corroborated by the increased power of 22 horses, as shown by

the Table to be necessary when the feed is increased b}' 5 quarters, viz. from 15 to

20 quarters per hour.

Further experiments were made with the object of ascertaining the power ab-

sorbed whilst rimning the machine empty at varying speeds. As this, however,

could only be done by altering the revolutions of the steam-engine itself, there were

practical difficulties attending the experiments which rendered any great range

impossible, and also somewhat impaired the accuracy of those which could be

made.

The general I'esult, however, showed that the power, as was expected, varied as

the cubes of the speeds.

Although it appeared, from the foregoing experiments, that the Carr's machine

when running empty takes, in round numbers, 50 per cent, of the power used by it
when at work upon 15 quarters of wheat per hour, it must not be supposed that it

is an uneconomic machine as compared with mill-stones. On the contrary, both in

power consumed and space occupied, the comparison is gi'eatly in its favour. To

grind 20 quarters of wheat per hour would require at least 20 pairs of 4 feet 6

millstones at work, and these would demand from 200 to 250 horse-power, and

would occupy, including the necessary spare stones for dressing, about fifteen times

as much space as the disintegi-ator.

On this point of " dressing," Carr's machine possesses a further gxeat advantage.

With ordinary millstones one sixth of the number are always out of work for this

purpose                                  and not  only are  they thus idle, but  the wages of highly skilled stone-
                                      ;

dressers have to be paid. In the Disintegrator nothing analogous to " dressing " is

required. The wearing parts are the studs ; and j udging fi'om appearances, it
would be many years before they require renewal. The machine from the principle

of its action possessing this peculiarity, that a worn stud, so long as it is strong

enough to beat the particles without sensibly yielding to them, will do its work

just as well as when it was new.

It woiild be beyond the scope of this paper to enter into the question of the

relative qualities of the products of this machine and of ordinary millstones. It

ought, however, to be stated that Mr. Gibson expressed himself to the writer as

highly satisfied on this point.

232 REPORT-- 1871.

On tlie Rainfall of Scotland. By Aiexakber Bxjchan-, M.A., F.R.S.E.

                               Secretary of the Scottish Meteorological Society.

   The paper was illustrated by a map of Scotland, showing the average annual
rainfall at 290 places, many of the averages heing from obscr-\-ations carried

--on through long series of years. The map brought out the large rainfall in the

west ascomjiared with the east a dift'erence which is strouglj- marked even in the
group of the Orkney Islands. The average rainfall in the west, at stations re-
moved from the intlnence of hills, is from about 36 to 40 inches; but in the cast

in similar situations the rainfall is as low as from 24 to 28 inches. In casting the

eye towards the watershed of the country running north and south, it is seen that
in ascending toward it from the west there occurs a rapid but by no means uni-

form increase, and in descending ii'oni it toward the east a rapid but by no means
uniform decrease. The largest rainfalls occur almost wholly among the hills

forming that part of the watershed of Scotland which is north of the Forth and
Clyde. The places characterized by the heaviest annual rainfidl are, so far as

--observation has yet enabled us to determine, the following : Glencroe, 128

inches; Ardlui, head of Loch Lomond, 115 inches; Bridge of Orchy, 110 inches;

Tyndrum, 104 inches ;          Glen Quoich,  102 inches                                                   and Portree, 101 inches.  At no
                                                                                                       ;

great distance from several of these places the rainfall is by no means excessive,

tlius pointing out an enormous difference of climate between places not fiir apart.

--Along the watershed of that part of Scotland which lies south of the Forth and

Clyde, no such excessive rainfall occurs, the highest being 71 inches at Ettrick

Pen Top 22G8 feet high. This diminished rainfall in the south, as compared with

that at places further north similarly situated, is due to the mountains of Ireland

draining the south-west winds of part of their moisture before they arrive at these

parts of Great Britain.

The distribution of the rainfall is very instructive in many districts, as in the

valley of the Forth, from the head of Loch Katrine to Nortli Berwick, where the
amoimt varies from 91 to 24 inches; in Clydesdale, where the quantit}' is greatest

at the head and foot of the valley respectively, being considerably less at inter-
mediate places ; and along Loch Linnhe and through the Caledonian "N^alley, where

the variations of the rainfall are very great, and striljingly show the inilueuce of

purely physical causes, such as the configuration of the surface, in determining the

amomits. In all these districts, as well as elsewhere, many cases might be referred
to which conclusively prove that the amount of the rainfall is very far from being

detei-miued by mere height. In truth it is to local considerations we must chielly
look for an explanation of the mode in which rain is distributed over any district

and hence in estimating the rainfall, particularly of hilly districts, no dogmatic

rule can be laid down.

   From observations which have been made at fifty places for lengthened periods,

it appears that the deficiency of the three driest consecutive years' rainfall from
the average, is generally from one fourth to one seventh, but that in some cases it
is as gi-eat as one third and in others as small as one ninth. Since then the defi-
ciency pf the three years of greatest drought has varied from about 33 to 11 per

cent.                          itis evident, at least in so far as Scotland is concerned, that no dogmatic rule
                            ;

can be given stating a rate of deficiency applicable to all cases.

If those districts were shaded off in which the rainfall does not exceed 30 inches

annually, the great grain-producing district of Scotland would be indicated ; and

it is interesting to note that in those districts which produce the best wheat the rain-

fall is lower thau elsewhere, being in many places as low as 24 inches annually.

           On a new Mill for Bisintegrathig Wheat. By TnoiiAS Care,

   In all previous mills and pulverizing- machines the material operated on inter-
venes betvreen, and is simultaneously in contact with two working surfaces. In
tliis mill the disintegration is eflfected while the material is falling freely or hein>5-

projected through the air unsupported, and no individual particle thereof, at tlie

moment of disintegration, is ever in contact with more than one portion of the

mill, viz. the particular heater striking and shattering it in mid air. It is also the
onljr mill in which the projectile impetus in the material acted on contributes to
its own disintegration.

    It consists of a series of beaters, formed of bars with open spaces between them,

arranged cylindrically on disk-plates, around and parallel with a central axle.

Into these disk-plates one end of each bar is rivetted, so that the bars stand at

right angles to the faces of the disks, while their other ends are rivetted into rings,

which so tie them that each bar is supported by the aggregate strength of (he
whole. These cylindrically arranged beaters (forming what may be called can-es

from the slight resemblance they have to squirrel-cages) are of different diameters,

so that when placed, as they are, concentrically one within the other, sufficient
spaces may intervene between to isolate each, and give them the requisite clear-
ance, and thus prevent any scrubbing or grinding-action on the material, which
might ensue between them if they were rotating in too close proximity.

   Tliese sets of beaters, of which for flour fourteen are used, are driven by means
of an open and a crossed strap with extreme rapidity in contrary directions to one
another, right and left alternately.

   The wheat flows in at the central orifice, and is thrown out by centrifuo-al force
from the first cage at a tangent to its circle, and at a speed equivalent to that at
which the beaters of the said cage are rotating, when, meeting the beaters of the
next cage moving in an opposite direction, its direction is reversed, and it is again
tlirown outwards to meet the beaters of the third cage, also moviuo- in a contrary
direction, and so on with the other cages until (and that in less than a second from

its first introduction) the fragments, reduced to fine flour, semolina, and bran are
deli^·ered in a radiating shower alike from every part of the periphery into a sur-
rounding casing, all tlie beaters (of which there are about 1000) beino- thus simul-
taneously eflective, and the balance of the machine maintained. Thus, thou"-]i

with these diflerent sets of beaters each acts independently, they are so arrano'od

relatively to one anotlier that not only is a repetition of the blows on the same
material thereby obtained, as many times repeated as there are different sets of
beaters, but the centrifugal force generated by the rotation of each set is caused to
throw the material forward to the next set. Thus the first set of beaters throws
it off and dashes it with great violence against the second, the second in like
manner against the third, and so on in directions the reverse of that in which
each successive set of beaters it strikes is moving, by which means the blows are

enabled to act with redoubled energy on the separated particles of matter as they

are discharged against them, precisely in the same way that stones are hurled

from a sling.

   The machine can hardly be impaired by work further than the necessary wear-
ing of the brasses of the four bearings. The crucible steel beaters, itis esti-
mated, should last for ten years at least, and are then capable of being quickly

replaced.

It can pulverize easily 20 qrs. of wheat per hour, and dispense with twentj'-five

pairs of millstones. The percentage of flour from it is nearly the same as from

millstones                                                 but the quality of flour from the new mill  is greatly supeiior,  it beinn-
                                                        ;

shattered into a fine granular state, not felled or killed as the bakers call it. The
disintegrated flour absorbs more water, forms a raw paste of greater tenacity, and,
when baked, a whiter, lighter, and much better keeping bread, with the sweet
nutty flavour of the wheat most agreeably preserved.

Tlie cost of production of flour by this system is considerably less than \iy any

other.

   T\vo of the machines have been successfully worked for many months at Messrs

Gibson and Walker's Flour Mills, IJonnington, Edinburgh.

                On tlie Gauge of Railways, By R. F. Faiblie, C.E.

    Last year, at the Liverpool Jleeting of the Association, the author read a paper

" On the Gauge for Railways of the Future," in which he pointed out the capacities
of narrow-gauge lines, and showed how unfavourably the railway-system, as at
present worked, contrasted with such lines when properly handled. He said that

experience had confirmed the views he had then put forth ; and he showed, by
giving the dimensions of his carnages, both for passengers and for goods, that upon
a 3-f£ gauge he is enabled to place stock of ample size and of less weight than can

be done on the 3-ft. 6-inch lines. Whate^Tr saving may be efl'ected in first cost
may be lost sight of, the great advantage Ij'ing in the saving etiected in working

expenses. Every ton of dead weight saved goes towards securing tlie prosperity of

the line ; and if we can obtain the ample platform which the 3-ft. gauge gives,
combined with so much saving in weight, there is nothing left to be desired. In
concluding, the author referred to one or two prevailing errors which he said

existed vdih reference to the narrow gauge.

The EJiysimeter, an Instrument for Measuriny tlie Speed of Flowing Water

                     or of Ships. By A. E. Fietchee, F.C.S.

   The principle involved in the construction of this instrument is the same as that
of the anemometer described by the author in 1869 (Brit. Assoc. Eeport, Trans, of

Sect. p. 48).

  A straight tube is placed in the cm-rent whose velocity is to be measured, and

held in a plane perpendicular to the direction of motion, so that the water Hows

across the open end of the pipe. This induces a tendency in the water of the pipe

to flow out, and so causes a partial vacuum in it.
   At the same time another tube, whose end has been bent round through an

angle of 90°, is held parallel to the straight tube in such a position that the bent

end faces the current. In this the lateral induction is nevitralized by the pressm-e

of the cun-ent. The difference between the pressures exerted in the two tubes by

the action of the flowing liquid is made a measure of its velocity.

In order to accomplish this the tubes which dip into the stream are continued

upwards till their ends are on a level with the eye of the observer. These ends

are  of  glass                          they are united at the top so as to form                                                   in  fact one tube, bent in the

shape of an inverted U- At the top of the bend, that is, in the centre of tliis

bridge-piece, is a small exhausting syringe or pump. By means of tliis a partial

vacuum can be formed in both of the long tubes whose ends dip into the running

water, and the water be made to rise through them into the glass tubes at the top,

which form the indicator of the instrument. The water is made to rise so far as

to fill but partially the parallel glass tubes of the indicator, in order that a com-

parison may be made of the heights of the columns. If the terminal tubes below

dip into still water, the heights of the columns will be equal, as they are held up

by the same pressure                                                                                  nor will it signif}^ if one  of them is further immereed in the

But if there is motion in the liquid into which the terminal tubes dip, a difference

of height will be                       observed                                                          the amount of  this diflperence  can  be  measm-ed by a
                                                                                  ;

conveniently divided scale, and from it the speed of the current known.

It is interesting now to obsei-ve that the mathematical formulne which were

educed to show the relation between the speed of the current of air, and the dif-

ference between the heights of the columns of ether in the indicator of tlie ane-

mometer, apply correctly also to show the relation there is between the speed of the

cm-rent of water, and the difference of the heights of the columns of water in the

indicator of the rhysimeter.

In the formula                                                                                        v-

                                      r=V'^X 1-638.

   To' test the correctness of this by experiment, a steadily flowing stream was se-
lected. The speed taken by the motion of a body floating on it was found to be 1 foot
per second. The difference of the height of the water-columns was 0'375 inch.
According to the formula the speed would hare been 1-003 feet per second. This
close agreement between the results of experiment and of calculation proves the

correctness of the calculations, not only as regai'ds the rhysimeter, but as regards
the anemometer also.

   AVhen the speed of the water or other flowing liquid is so great as to make tho

difference between the heights of the columns in the indicator inconveniently long,
it is easy to introduce a siphon containing mercurj'. In this the motion will be

less in proportion as its specific gravity is greater than that of water.

   This is necessary when the rhysimeter is used to measm-e the speed of ships.
The formida then becomes p=v-x0-087'36, where d= velocity of the ship in knots

On Stcam-loUer Lerjislation. By Latington E. Fletchek, C.E.

Although the Committee of the British Association " appointed to consider and

report on the yarioiis Plans proposed for Legislating on the subject of Steani-hoiler
Explosions, with a view to their Prevention," are compelled, from the reasons

stated in their ad interim Report, to postpone the consideration of the measures
recently recommended by the Parliamentary Committee, yet it is thought that
it wouid be well to take advantage of the present opportunity to discuss those

measures.

   The Report of the Parliamentary Committee is briefly as follows :
   The Parliamentary Committee had it laid before them in evidence that there
were not less than 100,000 steam-boilers in the country, and that from these there
sprung on an average CO explosions per annum, killing 75 persons and injuring

many others, from which it appeared that one boiler in every 2000 explodes annu-
ally. It was further stated that steam-boilers were in many instances situated in

much-frequented parts of towns and cities, under pavements in thronged thorough-

fares, in the lower storeys of houses,  and in the midst of crowded dwellings                                                                                                                                                                                   that
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

such boilers, notwithstanding their dangerous position, were often faulty in con-

struction, and frequently so set that inspection was impossible without removing

the brick-work setting, while they lacked proper gauges and necessary fittings.

The Parliamentary Committee anived at the conclusion that the majority af

explosions arise from negligence, cither as regards original construction, inattention

of users or their servants, neglect of proper repairs, and absence of proper and ne-

cessary fittings, while they further considered that the several voluntary asso-

ciations formed with a view of securing the periodical inspection of boilers had

been useful in preventing explosions.

The Parliamentary Committee recommend, not that inspection should be en-

forced by law in order to render its adoption universal, but that it be enacted that

every steam-user should be held responsible for the efficiency of his boiler, tlie

onus of proof of efficiency in the event of explosion being thrown upon him ; and
further, that in case of a servant being injured by the explosion of his master's
boiler, it should be no defence to plead that the damage arose from the neg-
lect of a fellow-servant. The Committee further recommend that coroners in
conducting tlieir inquiries on steam-boiler explosions should be assisted by a com-

petent engineer appointed liy the P)oard of Trade, and tliat these inquiries should

not, as at present, be limited to fatal explosions, but be extended to all others,

while reports on the result of each investigation should be forwarded to the Secre-

tary of State for the Home Department, and also be annually presented to Par-

liament.

   The eflPect of these recommendations, if carried into practice, would be to render
tlie steam-user readily amenable to an action for damages, so that those who
suffered from the consequences of an explosion would become the prosecutors.

Thus the Parliamentary Committee do not rcconunend direct prevention hi/ the

enforcement of insjyection, but indirect ])revent ion by penalt}/.
   It will be seen from the foregoing that the evidence laid before the Parliamenlary

Committee endorses the statements made in the Reports to the British Association

on the number and fatality of explosions*, while that Committee speaks favourably

of the effect of periodical inspection for the prevention of explosions.

Also the opinion of the Parliamentary Committee with regard to the cause of

explosions corroborates the views already expressed in the Reports to the British

Association on this subject, viz. that explosions are not mysterious, inexplicable,

or unavoidable; that they do not happen bj' caprice alike to the careful and the

--careless; that, as a rule, boilers burst simply because they are bad bad eillier

from original malconstruction, or from the condition into which they have been

allowed to fall ; and that explosions might be prevented by the exercise of common
knowledge and common caret- It is satisfactory to have this principle endorsed

by the Parliamentary Committee. Explosions have too long been considered acci-

ing, 1869; and Liverpool Meeting, 1870.

dental, and to be shrouded in mystery, and tliis view has seriously arrested pro-

gress. Where mystery begins prevention ends. It is now trusted that it will be

tlioroughly recognized that explosions are not the result of the freaks of fate, but
of commercial greed ; and this fundamental principle being firmly established, it

cannot be doubted that these catastrophes will ultimately, in one way or another,
be prevented. Thus it is thought that a most important step has been taken which

is a considerable matter for congratiUation.
    It is also satisfactory that the Parliamentary Committee has recommended that

coroners, when conducting inquiries consequent on steam-boiler explosions, should
be assisted by scientific assessors, a practice which was strongly urged in the Report

laid before the British Association at the Exeter Meeting*. It may, however, be
open to question whether it would be better that the engineer, as the Parliamen-
tary Committee recommend, should be appointed by the Board of Trade, or that
the coroner should be empowered to appoint two competent independent engineers
to investigate the cause of the explosion, and report thereon, as suggested in the
Report referred to. But whichever course be adopted, if competent reports be

ensured, a public service will be rendered.

   Not only, however, should the " result " of each investigation be reported to
Parliament, but also all the evidence of an engineering character, accompanied
with suitable drawings to illustrate the cause of the explosion, so that all the
information to be derived from these sad catastrophes might be disseminated as

widely as possible.
   Further, it is presumed that the reports on explosions which occur in Scotland,

where coroner's inquests are not held, will nevertheless be presented to Parliament.
   It is most important that the Bill embodj'ing the recommendations of the Par-

liamentary Committee should provide for other engineers having an opportunity
of making an examination of the fragments of the exploded boiler, as well as those
appointed by the Board of Trade, otherwise the intervention of the Board of Trade
will have a seriously harassing effect. The system practised in Scotland, where
the Procurator-Fiscal appoints an engineer to report to him oflicially, is found "Ncry

much to impede other investigations ; and engineers who have gone all the way

from England to visit the scene of explosions in Scotland with the view of giving
the facts to the public have been forbidden access to the scene of the catastrophe,
so that the Procurator-Fiscal receives information which he does not circulate,

while he withholds the opportunity of gaining information from those who would
circulate it, and thus he stands in the way of the public good. It is most impor-

tant that care should be taken that investigations by Board of Trade officers do not
have the same obstructive effect in England; and to this end there should be a
special provision that the coroner be invested with a discretionary power to admit
any suitable parties to make an investigation.

    Passing over the consideration of details, it is certainly considered that the
three following conclusions arrived at in the Parliamentary Report, first, that as
a rule explosions are not accidental but preventible ; secondly, that on the occur-
rence of explosions a complete investigation of the cause of the catastrophe should
be promoted by the appointment of a scientific assessor to assist the coroner; and,
thirdly, that reports of each investigation should be presented to Parliament:
these three conclusions, it is considered, form a foundation from which a super-
structure will spring in course of time which must eradicate steam-boiler ox-

plosions.

   What the precise character of that superstructure should be is a question on
which opinions may differ. Some, among whom are the Parliamentary Com-

mittee as already explained, prefer a system of pains and penalties to be inflicted
on the steam-user in the event of his allovring his boiler to give rise to an explo-
sion. Others prefer a system of direct prevention by the enforcement of inspection,

--on the following general basis : They would recommend a national S5'stem of

periodical inspection, enforced but not administered by the Government, that
administration being committed to the steam-users themselves, with a due infu-
sion of ex officio representatives of the public. For this purpose they propose that
steam-users should be aggregated into as many district corporations as might be

          * Transactions of the British Association at the Exeter Meeting, 1869, p. 50.

found desirable ; boards of control, empowered to carry out the inspections and
levy such rates upon the steam-users as niigbt be necessary for the conduct of the
service, being appointed by the popular election of the steam-users in each district,
the diflerent boards being aifiliated by means of an annual conference in order to
promote the harmonious -worldng of the whole system. Its advocates consider
that in this way a system of national inspection might be mildly, but at the same
time firmly administered, and that it would then not only prevent the majority of
steam-boiler explosions, but prove of gieat assistance to steam-users in the ma-
nagement of their boilers ; that it would be the means of disseminating much
valuable information ; that it would promote improvements ; that it would raise
the standard of boiler engineering, and prove a national gain.

   The question of the relative merits of the two systems, the one, that of direct
prevention by enforced inspection, the other, that of indirect prevention by the
infliction of penalty, is one of a very complex character, and the more it is dis-

cussed the better, and therefore the fullest expression of opinion is requested at

this time.

  A further topic for discussion on the present occasion is suggested, viz. whether

it might not be well to fix a minimum sum, to be exacted absolutely in the event
of every explosion, that fixed sum, however, when inadequate to cover the damage

done, not to limit the claim for compensation.

   Several advantages it is thought would spring from the adoption of this course,

both as regards compensation to those injured and the prevention of explosions.

    It frequently happens, on the occurrence of disastrous explosions, that boiler-

owners are quite unable to compensate those who have been injured. Such w.as

the case last year at Ijivei-pool, where an explosion occuired at a small iron foundry,
in October, killing four persons, laying the foimdry in ruins, smashing in some of
the surrounding dwelling-houses, and spreading a vast amount of devastation all
rovmd. The owners of the boiler, which had been picked up second-hand, and

was a little worn-out thing, were two working men, who but a short time before

the explosion had been acting as journeymen. Thejr were possessed of little or
no capital, and were rendered penniless by the disaster. Another very similar

case, though much more serious, occurred at Bingley in June 18G9, where as
many as fifteen persons were killed, and thirty-one others severely injured by the
explosion of a boiler at a bobbin turnery. In this case the user of the boiler was

only a tenant; and, judging from the ruined appearance of the premises after the
explosion, any attempt to gain compensation for the loss of fifteen lives and thirty-
one cases of serious personal injury would have been absolutely futile. The plan of

imposing a fixed minimum penalty would tend somewhat to meet this difficulty, as
the surplus of one would correct the deficit of another, and in this way a com-

pensation fund might be established for the benefit of the sufferers.

    Further, this measure would have a good effect upon steam-users, inasmuch as
they would then incur a positive liability, which would act as a more definite

stimulus than the vague apprehension of an action for damages, in which they
might hope to get off. Also, if this penalty were rendered absolute, it would save

a vast amount of litigation, and boiler-ovraers would then see that it was as mucb

to their interest to believe that explosions were preventible as that they were

accidental ; and such being the case they would soon find out the way to prevent

them*.

   This definite minimum penalty would also tend to meet the present tendency of

boiler-owners to seek to purchase indemnities from Insurance Companies in the
event of explosions, rather than competent inspection to prevent these catas-
trophes, since, if the penalty were made sufficiently high, it would pay an insu-
rance company as well to make inspections and prevent explosions as to adopt
 comparatively little inspection, permit occasional if not frequent explosions, and
pay compensation. As pointed out last year at Liverpool, the principle of steam-
boiler insurance by joint-stock companies does not, under the influence of com-

     * Steam-users, however, should be exempted from penalty in those eases of explosion
 resulting from the direct intention of some evil-disposed person, for which the user could
 not be lield responsible, and which might be regarded as an act of conspu-acy, intrigue,
or plot.

petition, necessarily insure inspection, inasmuch as the number of explosions being
one in 2000 boilers per annum, it follows that the net cost of insurance is only one
shilling- for every £100, whicb. must evidently be inadequate for any description
of inspection by way of prevention. Insurance, therefore, as previously pointed

out, is cheap, while adequate inspection is costly ; so that inspection is opposed to

dividend, for which joint-stock companies are clearly established. Some correc-
tive, therefore, is plainly necessary, and this it is thought would in some measure

be found by the establishment of a tixed substantial penalty in the event of every
explosion, irrespective of the amount of damage done. Also the imposition of a
penalty on every inspection-association or insurance company failing to prevent
the explosion of a boiler under their care, might have a most wholesome tendency,
this penalty being ecjual and in addition to the one imposed on the owner, and; in
like manner, devoted to the support of the compensation fund *.

   In conclusion, although entire assent cannot be accorded to the Pai'Uamentary

Report, yet it is most cordially wished that every success may attend the adoption
of the measures recommended therein, and that they may result in preventing
many explosions, and in diminishing the lamentable loss of life at present result-

ing from the constant recurrence of these catastrophes.

        On Designing Pointed Eoofs. By Thomas Gilloit.

Description of a Salmon-ladder meant to suit the varying levels of a LaJce or

   Reservoir. By James Leslie, M.I. G.E. (Commumcatcd by Alex. Leslie.)

   So long as the reservoir or lake is full and overflowing the fish may ascend the

waste weir if not too steep, and if otherwise properly constructed and furnished;
where necessary, with a salmon-ladder ; but whenever the water ceases to overflow
the waste weir, the means for the ascent of the fish are generally cut off.

   The sluices at the outlet of a lake used as a reservoir are in general (though.
there may be exceptions to the rule) placed at or near the lowest level of the
outlet; and the velocity of the current through them is consequently, in most
cases, so great that no fish can swim against it until the surface of the water be
run down so low as to be near the level of the outlet, and the velocity be thereby
reduced ; and in that latter case the power to ascend into the lake is of no great

value, as the salmon have little or no disposition to run during droughts.
    This design consists of a series of sluices placed side by side at different levels,

each sluice opening by being lowered instead of by being raised, as is the general
mode, and each commencing with the salmon-ladder, which passes along in front
of the sluices, and is composed of alternate pools and falls. In this design it
is contemplated that on all occasions the whole outflow required to run down
the stream should be through mily one sluice at a time, and over the top of
that sluice, which would open by lowering, and shut by being raised, except in
extreme floods, when, for the sake of keeping down the level of the lake, so as to

avoid flooding the adjoining lands, or for any other similar reason, it may be neces-

saiy to provide a lower outlet, or the means for a more rapid discharge for the

water.

Assuming an instance of a lake with a rise and fall on the surface of 12 feet,

and that it is full, or just up to the level of the waste weir; the uppermost sluice

of the series is opened so that the water may How over it to the depth of, say, 9 or

12 inches, which depth we mav assume to be necessary to give the statutory com-

pensation. The water will then run down the ladder, which is composed of a

series of pools formed by stops reaching quite across from wall to wall, the fall

from surface to surface of those steps being 18 inches, and the depth of the pools

Anot less than 3 feet.  fish may then easily leap over the successive falls from

the lowest to the highest, after which they must take the last leap over the outlet

sluice into the lake, that last leap being'at first like all the others, 18 incheS; but

   * The exemption described above in favour of steam-users should also apply under
similar circumstances to Inspection Asaociations or Insurance Companies.

   diminishing in beiglit as the level of the lake is lowered, till at last it is nothing,

  when the level of the lake comes to the same as that of the highest pool. After
  that, when the surface of the lake gets too low to give the statutory or requisite

  supply of water over the uppermost stop, the uppermost sluice is shut, and the

  one next in order of descent is opened, when the fish would have one leap fewer

  than before, entering the lake bj^ leaping over the second sluice, and then in suc-
  cession as the level of tlie lake falls over each of the other sluices, having a leap

       On a new System of Warming and Ventilation. By J. D. Moerison.

     The author called attention to his paper which was read at the Exeter Meeting,
  and stated that he introduced improvements which had been approved of bv the

 mental room, where his system of ventilation might be tested pi-actically.

                             By E. A. Peacock, C.E., F.G.S.

    It is proposed to provide " testing " -links for each new cable, one link to be con-

 nected mth the cable at each of its ends, and another link to form part of the cable

 at every 15 f;ithoms. Each new link will be a flat oval piece of wrought iron,
 whose thickness will be equal to the diameter of the metal of each ordinary link.
 The new links will be cut out of a plate of iron, by means of a steam-punch, and
 will be left by it of the oval form and having three circular holes through, one in
 the centre and another halfway to each end. The use of the centre hole, wliich

 will be 1^-inch diameter for a l-inch cable, is this .-^a piece of cylindrical bar iron,
 about G inches long and a shade less than li-inch diameter, is to be inserted into
 this hole, and by means of this bar one of the 15-fathoni lengths can be connected
 with a hydrostatic press, the other end of the " length " being fastened at the
 opposite end of the platform by means of another 6-inch bar, and then the testing-

 strain may be applied. The two other holes are to connect the testing links with

 the adjoining parts of the cable.

   A cylindrical bar of South-Wales iron was tested by the late Mr. Telford, and

 its increase of length was found to be 11-G8 per cent. After the test, and its di.a-
 nieter was reduced from 1| inch to IJ, it was torn asunder by 43 tons 11 cwt.
 Therefore if the "length " of 15 fathoms is increased by testing to an amount ex-
 ceeding (say) 8 per cent, of its original length, its diameter, and consequently its

streuf/th, will have been too much reduced, and it ought to be condemned. When

 the stretching is confined within- moderate limits so as to justify the tester in

stamping and passing it, the actual length may be stamped on the testijig-link ; and
then, when the cable has been exposed to severe strains on service, it may be laid

straight along the pier, and each length be remeasured to ascertain if the strain has
been too great, and if any part ought to be condemned.

    Links have been found to be cracked after having apparently withstood the test
therefore each length, after being tested (before being stamped), should be lifted
upon & well-lighted bench of the height of a table, and then every link should Ijo

exammed carefully all over with a magnifpng-glass. If any link is fouud to be

cracked, or otherwise defective, the "length " of coiu-se ought to be rejected.

           Auiomatic Gauge for the Discharcje of Water over Waste Weirs.
                    Bij Thomas Stevenson, F.R.S.E., M.I.C.E., C.E.

   The author stated that, in order to ascertain the amoimt of available rainfall,
which is so important in questions of water supply, it is necessary to gauge the
quantity of water which escapes at the waste weirs of reservoirs. Observations
made only once or twice a day cannot supply the infoiiuation. It is proposed
to placea tube perforated vertically with small holes, the lowest of whicli is on a
level with the top of the waste weir, so that, whenever water passes over the

weir, it also passes through the holes in the tube. The water is collected in a
tank capable of holding the discharge for a certain number of hours ; the quantity
so collected is a known submultiple of what passes over the weir. The discharge
through the holes is ascertained by experiment. This self-acting apparatus will

render the continuous observations of floods unnecessary.

TTiermometer of Translation for recording the Daily Changes of Temperature.

   The author described what he termed a thermometer of translation, which con-
sisted of an expansible body with a needle-point at its upper end, and which, when
expanded by the sun, is fixed at its upper end by a needle-point catching into fine

teeth cut in a sheet of glass or other material of small expansibility placed below.

"When the sun is obsciu'ed, the upper end being fixed, the conti-action raises the
centre of gi-avity of the bar. In this way the daily march or creep of the bar
chronicles the change or changes of temperature. Mr. Stevenson also described
two different methods, suggested by his friends Professors Tait and Swan, for
increasing the amount of expansion of the material employed.

to the machinery, but saved the road from the grinding-action of the iron wheels
which was so injurious to bye-ways. There had been serious objections made to
the use of these engines with rigid tires ; but the author ventured to assert that
the india-rubber tires not only did not injure, but actually improved the roads.
The only ground upon which india-rubber tires did not work well was where the
soil was extremely wet, or of a very soft and sloppy nature. For farm work, the

wheels of the engine required a much thicker coat of india-rubber.

                                      Notes on Dredging at Madeira.

           By fhe Rev. Robeet Boca Watson, B.A., F.E.S.E., F.G.S.

   The difficulties of shell-gathering at Madeira are very many and very great.
As the result of several years' work, the author has to record that six or seven spe-
cies mentioned in MacAndrew's List have hitherto escaped him ; that to the one
hundred and twenty-seven species named by MacAndrew (besides these he gives

twenty-nine unnamed = one hundred and fifty-six in all) the author has succeeded

in adding something like two hundred and fifty more, or from three hundred and
fifty to four hundred in all ; and while these strongly confirm MacAndrew's gene-
ralization of the Mediterranean character of the Mollusca, yet a few of them pre-
sent forms belonging some of them to the tropics, and others to very distant
localities, as, for instance, Ranella rhodnstoma and Triton chhrostoma, which Reeve,
not perhaps very reliably, assigns, the first to the Islands of Capul and Masbate of
the Philippines, and the second to the Island of Annaa in the Pacific. Further,
among these two hundred or two hundred and fifty species, eighty or, perhaps,

ninety may probably prove to be new species, and three or four new genera.
   It is somewhat curious that only one of the author's new species has been

recognized by Mr. Gwyn Jeff'reys as obtained by him from the ' Porcupine'

dredgings.

   The publication of full details is contemplated by the author.

On the Ciliated Condition of the Inner Layer of tlie Blastoderm and of the
   Omphalo-mesenteric Vessels in the Egg of the Common Fowl. By 15. T. Lowne.
   Mr. Lowne stated that the number of observations he had at present made were

insufficient to substantiate his opinion beyond a doubt, but that he thought it ex-
tremely probable, from what he had seen, that, 1st, the inner layer of the blastoderm

is ciUated, at least in tracts of its surface. He had several times observed the most

marked cmTents, and he believed, but was not certain, that he had distinguished

 the cilia.

   2ndly. From a single observation he thought that the interior of the omphalo-
mesenteric vessels is ciliated. He saw in a portion of the blastoderm of a five-day

chick the most marked circulation in the omphalo-mesenteric vessels. In one
large vessel, especially where the two cut extremities were blocked with blood-
corpuscles, a rapid movement was taking place.

    Mr. Lowne stated that he was still investigating the subject.

               For a period of neai-ly thirty years Dr. Cooke's life was a series of battles for tlic

         truth. In every battle his genius and eloquence made him victorious. He freed the
         Presbj'terian Church from Arianism. He gave a new impulse to spiritual life and
         work among the Protestants of Ireland. He defended against all assailants the
         Divine authority of national establishments of religion. He so moulded the new
          systems of elementaiy and collegiate education as to make them suitable to the wants
         of the people. And he inaugiu-ated a constitutional party in Ulster which preserved

           the peace of Ireland, and gave a death-blow to Repeal. Editor's Preface.

    " It lias fallen to the lot of most people to be obliged to select a dwelling for lease

    or purchase                                                  to many to be obliged to buiUl one.  Only when .such a necessity arises,
                                                              ;

    IS the advantage of special knowledge fully perceived, and those who do not expe-

    rience this for the most part pay for rashness and want of consideration. The object

    of this work is to afford to persons so situated the benefit of the experience of others

    as to what they should seek, and what avoid ; to what points their enquiries should
    be directed, and in what consist the excellences of a well-built house, and the dangers

    and misery of an ill-construoted one."

            The Eeports of the Eoyal Commissioners and Inspectors of Schools express

          a veiy general and reasonable dissatisfaction with the text-books at present in
          tise. The result is a daily increasing- want of suitable manuals, and nowhere
           is this gi-eater than at the very outset of all teaching.

             The object of the present Series is therefore twofold : to sujiply a gi-aduated
          course of English instruction, fi-om the very alphabet up to the writings of our
          classical authors, of such a nature as to comply with the requirements of the

        New Code, also to provide a set of suitable manuals for those schools which

          do not come under any government supervision, and for private use.
