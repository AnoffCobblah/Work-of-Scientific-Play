Specific Researches in Science involving applications to
                   Government or public bodies.

                   MAGNETICAL OBSERVATIONS.

   Resolved, -- 1. That the British Association views with high in
terest the system of Simultaneous Magnetic Observations which

have been for some time carrying on in Germany and in various
parts of Europe, and the important results towards which they
have already led ; and that they consider it highly desirable
that similar series of observations, to be regularly continued in
correspondence with and in extension of these, should be insti
tuted in various parts of the British dominions.

   2. That this Association considers the following localities as
particularly important :

        Canada,          Van Diemen's Land,
        Ceylon,          Mauritius, or the
        St. Helena,      Cape of Good Hope ;

and that they are willing to supply Instruments for the purpose
of observation.

   3. That in these series of observations, the three elements of
horizontal direction, dip, and intensity, or their theoretical
equivalents, be insisted on, as also their hourly changes, and on
appointed days their momentary fluctuations.

   4. That this Association views it as highly important that the
XXli  EIGHTH REPORT 1838.

deficiency yet existing in our knowledge of Terrestrial Magnet
ism in the Southern Hemisphere should be supplied by obser
vations of the magnetic direction and intensity, especially in the
higher latitudes, between the meridians of New Holland and
Cape Horn ; and they desire strongly to recommend to Her
Majesty's Government the. appointment of a naval expedition
directed expressly to that object.

   5. That in the event of such expedition being undertaken, it
would be desirable that the officer charged with its conduct should
prosecute both branches of observations alluded to in Resolu
tion 3, so far as circumstances will permit.

    6. That it would be most desirable that the observations so
performed, both in the fixed stations and in the course of the
expedition, should be communicated to Prof. Lloyd.

    7. That Sir John Herschel, Mr. Whewell, Mr. Peacock, and
Prof. Lloyd be appointed a Committee to represent to Govern

 ment these recommendations.

    8. That the same gentlemen be empowered to act as a Com
 mittee, with power to add to their number, for the purpose, of
 drawing up plans of Scientific cooperation, &c. &c, relating to
 the subject, and reporting to the Association.

     9. That the sum of 400/. be placed at the disposal of the
above-named Committee, for the purposes above mentioned*.

                                       ASTRONOMY.

  J.Sir Herschel and Mr. Baily were requested to make

application to Government for increase in the instrumental
power of the Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope, and
the addition of at least one assistant to that establishment.

                   SCIENTIFIC RESEARCHES IN INDIA.
   Resolved, -- 1. That the British Association regard the mea
surement of an arc of longitude in India comparable in extent
to the meridional arc already measured in that country, as a
most important contribution to other facts illustrative of the
earth's true figure, and, by a necessary consequence, to the pro
gress of astronomy.
   2. That the verification and comparison of the standards of the
Indian and English surveys, as compared with the proposed
Parliamentary standard, is indispensable to the correct know
ledge of the meridional and parallel arcs.

    · The application to Government on this subject has been successful, the

J.command of an expedition to the Antarctic regions being entrusted to Capt.
     C. Ross.
          DESIDERATA, ETC.                                     XX1U

   3. That pendulum observations at the principal elevations, or
contiguous plains, and on the sea-coast, if possible, on the same
parallels of latitude, will afford results of great value to physical
science.

   4. That observations for the determination of the Laws of Re
fraction in the elevated regions of the Himalayas, and at the
Observatories of Madras and Bombay, will be a most important
service to science.

   5 . That it is highly desirable also that magnetical observations
should be made in India similar to those which are carrying on
in other parts of the world, and which are justly regarded with
so much interest.

   6. That a topographical map of India, upon a large scale, ac
companied by statistical and geological information, would be
highly desirable *.

                                  ORDNANCE SURVEY.

   Resolved, --That a Committee be appointed to inquire how
far, in the future progress of the Ordnance Survey, the several

metalliferous and coal-mining districts could be represented on

a larger scale. The Committee to consist of Mr. Greenough,
Mr. Griffith, Mr. De la Beche, and Major Portlock.

          MINING RECORDS.

   Resolved,-- 1. That it is the opinion of this Meeting, that,
with a view to prevent the loss of life and of property which
must inevitably ensue from the want of accurate mining records,

it is a matter of national importance that a depository should
be established for preserving such records of subterranean ope

rations in collieries and other mining districts.

2. That a Committee be appointed to draw up a Memorial
and to communicate with the Government in the name of the
British Association, respecting the most effectual method of
carrying the above resolution into effect.
3. That the Committee consist of the following gentlemen,
with power to add to their number : The Marquis of Northamp
ton, Sir  GC.haGrlielbserLte,mEosnq, .,SJir.  Philip Egerton,   John Vivian, Esq.,

Specific Researches in Science involving Grants of Money.

   The following new Recommendations were adopted by the
General Committee*.
That it is desirable that the meteorological observations made
at the equinoxes and solstices, agreeably to the recommenda
tions of Sir John Herschel, Bart., should be collected together,
as far as is practicable, and reduced to an uniform mode of ex
pression, so that comparisons may be made of the same, with a
view of deducing results that may lead to the improvement and
elucidation of meteorology.

   That Sir John Herschel be requested to superintend the same,
and that the sum of 100/. be placed at his disposal for that

purpose.

   That it is desirable that the whole of the stars observed by
Lacaille at the Cape of Good Hope, the observations of which
are recorded in his Caelum Australe Stelliferum, should be re

duced.   Sir  J.  Herschel,  Mr. Airy,  and  Mr. Henderson  be a

   That

Committee for carrying the same into effect.
That the sum of 200/. be appropriated to that purpose.
That it is desirable that a Revision of the Nomenclature of

the Stars should be made, with a view to ascertain whether or

not a more correct distribution of them amongst the present
constellations, or such other constellations as it may be con

J.sidered advisable to adopt, may be formed.
That Sir          Herschel, Mr. Whewell, and Mr. Baily be a

Committee for that purpose, and to report on the same at the
next meeting of the Association.
That the sum of 50/. be appropriated to defray the expenses
that may be incurred in this inquiry.

    ADDRESS

MR. M U R C H I S O N.

(jrENTLEMEN, -- At the conclusion of the first Septenary which has

elapsed since the establishment of the British Association, the Council

have deemed it expedient to direct us to prepare a general and com

prehensive view of its past progress and future prospects. In virtue,
therefore, of the commission thus entrusted to us, we shall endeavour

to perform a task which we cannot approach without a feeling of ap

prehension and anxiety, impressed as we are with the difficulty of duly
appreciating the prominent labours of our associates, and of estimating

their bearing and probable influence on the advancement of science.

The space of time, however, which is allotted to this address, will not

allow us to attempt an analysis of all the past proceedings of the As

sociation. We are therefore compelled to confine ourselves to a few

allusions to the reports of former meetings, (dwelling more particularly

on the last,) and to a statement of the great principles which form the

basis of our constitution, and which have directed and regulated its

practical operations. And  in thus stating the aims of the Asso
                           if,
                                       it
ciation, and the principles on which proceeds, we should be guilty of

repeating some things which have been better said before, we trust     it
will be borne in mind, that from the migratory character of our meet

ings, and the change which that character implies in the body of mem

bers present at each, probability arises, that those principles may
not be sufficiently understood, they are not from time to time re
a

           if

stated and re-explained.

   It would be superfluous for us to speak of those objects of the As

sociation which are the most obvious, and which undoubtedly con

stitute the highest enjoyment these meetings afford us-- the union of
congenial minds -- the mutual communication, without let or hindrance,
of the knowledge we have acquired in our respective pursuits --the
scintillations of new ideas struck out in private conversation and pub
lic discussion. " This feast of reason and this flow of soul," agreeable

and instructive as is, requires no comment and though contri
it
                           it
                                   is

                                                                  ;

                                                                   it
butes most essentially to all the purposes for which we are assembled,

and gives life to all our proceedings,     however on no account to be

regarded as the chief aim and business of our meetings. That which
XXXU  EIGHTH REPORT 1838.

 has, from the first, gentlemen, been laid down as the highest object for
 which we meet, is to supply the great defect under which science has
 formerly laboured, of depending solely on individual and insulated

 efforts, by combining its cultivators into a body politic, calculated to
 give force and consistence to those efforts, and exercise a powerful
 influence both on its own members and on the public mind ; thus

 marshalling a scattered militia into an organized and effective army,

 and converting desultory incursions into a regular and progressive
 march. The want of some such public authority in matters of science

 as belongs to an union like the present, could not be more strikingly
 shown than by the service which, on two occasions, the British Asso

 ciation has rendered to astronomy, in obtaining from Government the
 means of effecting the laborious and expensive reductions of the obser
 vations, first of the planets, and lastly of the moon, which had been

 made by Bradley, Maskelyne, and Pond. The existence and liberal
support of the noble establishment at which these observations were
 made, bore evidence that our rulers have not been insensible to the

 immense importance of astronomical inquiries to a great maritime
nation ; but that so much of the precious ore which had been accu
mulated during the greater part of a century, by the successive labours
of the greatest practical astronomers of any age or nation, should have

remained unwrought and nearly useless for the highest applications of
science, amidst the vain and oft-repeated regrets of those who were
the most competent judges of its value, --what does this prove, but that
there were no councillors of sufficient weight, number, or influence,

not only to offer advice to the Government, but also to secure attention

to it when offered ?

    In whatever degree the practical value of science may be beginning
to be understood and appreciated among us, business of more proxi
mate interest and more obvious urgency engrosses the attention of our

public functionaries and legislators : numerous projects are presented
to them rarely reduced to a practical form, among which they know
not how to distinguish which are, and which are not deserving of na
tional encouragement; and the consequence has been, with few ex

ceptions, the general discouragement of all,-- a consequence neither
conducive to the reputation, nor serviceable to the interests of so great
a country. But a representation on subjects of science proceeding from

such an Association as this bears a public character, and carries with it
a degree of weight which does not, and ought not, to attach to indivi

dual applications; and as long as the same judgement and forbearance

which have hitherto characterized its course in this respect shall con

tinue to be exercised,-- as long as special care is taken to ask nothing
of Government but what it belongs to the national interests or honoitr

to effect, and what cannot be effected but by national means, --so long
             ADDRESS BY MR. MURCHISON.                              XXXlii

doubtless that attention will be paid to our recommendations which they
have already begun to receive. Wisely cautious and reserved in exerting
its influence, the Association has hitherto made but few applications to

the government. Besides those to which we have before referred, and

which were immediately complied with, another was made regarding

the slow progress of the trigonometrical surveys of England and Scot

land : the latter probably owes its recent acceleration to the attention

thus first drawn to the subject, subsequently reinforced by a deputation
from the Royal Society of Scotland ; but the survey of England,
which, having commenced nearly half a century ago, has not yet

reached the Trent, is still in abeyance ; and these northern districts in

which we are assembled, and which comprise so large a part of the

staple riches of the country, continue without their due share of the

advantages which would attend its execution. There have been like

wise two other national objects on which the Association has expressed

its opinion ; the one being the establishment of a inagnetical observa

tory in Great Britain, the other an expedition for the purpose of making

magnetical observations in the Antarctic seas. For the attainment of

the former of these objects no interference was found necessary, an

arrangement every way satisfactory being determined upon for con

necting it with the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, on the recommen

dation of the Board of Visitors. The publication, in the present volume

of our Transactions, of an elaborate report on the variations of the mag
netic intensity of the earth, (unquestionably one of the most valuable

which has hitherto appeared in them, whether we consider the labo

rious reductions it has required, or the important conclusions to which

they lead,) recals our attention to the latter point. The subject is one

of such deep interest, that we hope we shall not be thought to trespass
too much on the time of the meeting, if we repeat some of Major
Sabine's remarks upon it in his own words :--

   " I have already adverted to what the influence of the Association

may effect, in causing the spaces yet vacant on the map, in the British
possessions in India and Canada, to be filled. But beyond all compa

rison, the most important service of this kind, which this or any other

country could render to this branch of science, would be by rilling the
void still existing in the southern hemisphere, and particularly in the
vicinity of those parts of that hemisphere which are of principal mag

netic interest. This can only be accomplished by a naval voyage ; for
which it is natural that other countries should look to England. That

the nations that have made exertions in the same cause do look to

             cannot be better shown than by the following extract

XXXÏV  EIGHTH REPORT 1838.

I am sure will be cordially responded to by all who cultivate science

in this country, and particularly by those who know the kindly feeling
with which Englishmen are ever welcomed in Norway.

   " C'est le Storthing (la Chambre des Deputes) de la Norvège, qui a
donné les frais à l'expédition en Sibérie. On a fait cela dans un teins

où oii a refusé les dépenses pour un château de résidence pour sa

Majesté à Christiania. Dans un tems, où une telle économie a été
nécessaire, il est très honorable, qu'une Chambre, composée de toutes

les classes du peuple, même d'un grand nombre de paysans, a una
nimement résolu de donner les frais pour une expédition purement
scientifique, dont les résultats n'auront jamais aucune utilité écono

mique pour la patrie, et dont on ne comprenait pas la haute valeur

scientifique. Regardé les ressources très-bornés de notre pays, c'est

une générosité presque sans exemple.
   " Comme la petite Norvège a fourni toutes les observations entre les

méridiens de Greenwich et de Ochozk, et entre les parallèles de 40° et
75° de latitude boréale, il ne me semble pas une demande trop grande
ou immodeste à l'Angleterre, si grande, si riche, si puissante, qui a
nécessairement un plus grand intérêt dans toutes les sciences combinées

avec la navigation, de fournir toute la partie méridionale de la carte.

Une telle entreprise doit réfléchir une splendeur à la nation, et payera
à la fin les frais par des résultats aussi utiles pour les sciences que pour

la navigation. Il ne faut plus dans notre tems laisser l'avancement des

sciences au hasard. Par des observations fragmentaires et discontinués
on a tâché avec grande peine d'étudier les phénomènes magnétiques de
la terre pendant deux ou trois siècles. Par deux ou trois expéditions
arrangées exprès pour ce but, on pourrait en peu d'années avoir une

collection plus complète, et d'une plus grande utilité pour la théorie."
    The subject has in every way a claim on this country. The existence

of four governing centres, and the system of the phenomena in corre
spondence therewith, was originally a British discovery. The sagacity
of our countryman Halley was the first to penetrate through the com
plexity of the phenomena, and to discern what is now becoming gene
rally recognised. England was also the first country which sent an
expedition expressly for magnetic observation, namely, that of Halley
in 1698 and 1699. Whilst approving and cordially co-operating in
magnetic inquiries of other kinds which have their origin in other
countries, it is right that we should feel a peculiar interest in that in

which we have ourselves led the way, especially when its object is
subordinate to none. As the research would require to be prosecuted
in the high latitudes, a familiarity with the navigation of such latitudes
would be important in the person who should undertake this service ;

and a strong individual interest in the subject itself would be of course

a most valuable qualification. I need scarcely say, that the country
ADDRESS BY MR. MURCHISON.  XXXV

possesses a naval officer* in whom these qualifications unite in a

remarkable degree with all others that are requisite ; and if fitting in

struments make fitting times, none surely can be better than the pre
sent. Viewed in itself and in its various relations, the magnetism of
the earth cannot be counted less than one of the most important
branches of the physical history of the planet we inhabit ; and we may
feel quite assured, that the completion of our knowledge of its distri
bution on the surface of the earth would be regarded by our contem
poraries and by posterity as a fitting enterprise of a maritime people,
and a worthy achievement of a nation which has ever sought to rank
foremost in every arduous and honourable undertaking.

    The course pursued by the Association in reference to this object is
well calculated to show the system of its operations, and the active but

yet unintrusive and guarded spirit in which it prosecutes its aims. It

was proposed at one of our meetings by the Committee of the Physical
Section, that a representation should be made to government of the

advantage which would accrue to science from an expedition to the
Southern Ocean, devoted to the purpose chiefly of instituting mag-
netical observations. This proposal first underwent the revision of the
Committee of Recommendations, and then obtained the sanction of

the General Committee of scientific members ; subsequent circum

stances, however, being considered by the Council as unfavourable to
the success of the application, it was not urged at that time upon the

government, yet the object was not lost sight of. The Association
next procured reports to be drawn up, (from one of which we have
quoted the foregoing paragraph,) presenting a luminous exposition,
both from published and unpublished sources, of the present state of
our knowledge of the magnetism of the earth, and of the reasons which

there are for wishing to extend to the Southern hemisphere those re

searches which in the Northern have led to such important conclu

sions; and thus has the way been prepared through information thus

communicated to the public for pursuing the intended course with

advantage, and making a more effectual application to the government.

There may be, once in an age, or in many ages, an individual ani
mated by so lofty an ardour for the advancement of a favourite branch
of knowledge, as to engage, at his own cost, in an enterprise (like a
recent survey of the southern skies) which it might have become a
nation to take upon itself; and there may be an individual whose dis
interested munificence may extend to the point of rendering labours of

this magnitude as available to the public as if the state itself had con

tributed its aid ; but such sacrifices to science are not only uncommon,

they are in general impracticable ; and there are numerous most im

portant data and elements for philosophical reasoning, with all its

                                            * Capt. James Ross, R. N.

train of practical utilities, which individuals cannot be expected to

undertake, unless provided with pecuniary assistance. We have al
ready said, that one of the principles on which the Association pro
ceeds, is not to look to government for anything which can be other

wise attained ; but when this Institution was established, the founders

of it foresaw that it might itself be made applicable, in a great degree,
to the object of supplying funds for such undertakings. The resources

of other societies are employed on their publications or collections ;
and it is one of the rules of the German scientific " Reunions," that

they shall possess no property. Our objects were more extensive than
theirs, and, therefore, our plan was different. We have accumulated

                                             it,
                                                              it
                                                                     is
property and expended                        to give wings to investigation, partly by

providing instruments and materials for carrying on certain determi

nate inquiries, and partly in defraying the expense of labour, especially

labour of that kind, which, whilst                                       of the highest value in its re

sults, possesses no attractions in its execution, and would meet with no

adequate remuneration.
   The present volume of our Transactions contains many proofs of

the service which the Association has rendered by such applications of
its pecuniary means. In the account there rendered of the discussion
of observations of the Tides, Mr. Lubbock (the Reporter) thus ex
plains the manner in which the last grant of money placed at his dis

posal has been employed. He reports that two gentlemen had been

engaged by him to discuss the observations which had been accumu

lated at Liverpool and the London Docks, --the one series continued

during nineteen years, and consisting of 13,391 observations, the

other carried on for thirty-five years, and including 24-,592 obser

vations, -- and also to examine carefully the establishment and average

height high water in order to ascertain the fluctuation to which these

quantities are subject and after bearing testimony to the pains and
accuracy with which the work has been executed, and stating the

conclusions which result from these laborious calculations, adds, that
" they never could have been undertaken but for the interest which

has been felt on the subject by some of the most distinguished mem

bers of the Association, and but for the pecuniary grants which have

at different times been   devoted to         this  object," expressing, at the  same
time, a well-grounded                        when   these results (which have   since

the Association has not deemed expedient to restrict itself to these.
Whenever the committee of any section has been desirous of confiding
any inquiry involving an outlay of money to competent person, the
committees of revision and approval have always been anxious to
comply with the recommendation. The meeting will observe witli satis
faction that the first step towards the solution of the geological question

alluded to by Mr. Lubbock, has been taken under the superintendence
of the committee appointed for the purpose. Mr. Whewell, to whose

more special superintendence the conduct of this work was intrusted,

reports that a line has been leveled by Mr. Bunt from Bridgewater to
Axmouth, to be thence continued to the Bristol Channel ; and such

marks have been left as will allow of repeating or extending the levels,

and comparing at a future period the height of the several fixed points.
    We are thus led to say a few words about Geology, a science which

is rapidly advancing to take its permanent station among the more ac

curate natural sciences. It is now six years since Mr. Conybeare laid
before us his eloquent general view of its then existing state ; but the
lapse of a much shorter period in a science which is making such vi

gorous shoots, would present sufficient materials for a report which
should enumerate and define the latest conquests it has achieved. The

fact that the very literature of this subject so vast, that none but; is,
                 a
the most practised and laborious geologists can keep pace with its prois

gress and though the anniversary discourses of the successive Presidents
of the Geological Society generally contain sketch of the works and

memoirs which have appeared in the course of the preceding year, still
we are convinced, that a condensed retrospect of the progress of geo

logy, which should embrace a somewhat larger period and a wider

range, executed from time to time at the request of the Association,

would not only be grateful to geologists, but would also tend to com
bine the discoveries and promote the advancement of this science. But

besides general reports on geology, this Association will,  hoped,

encourage continued attention to the consideration of mineral veins,
           a
since there  is  no branch of geology of such direct public interest as

the results of the miner's discoveries. In a clear and instructive re

port formerly read by our Treasurer, Mr. John Taylor (himself most
experienced and able miner), he expressed wish, which we trust to

see accomplished, that miners would hereafter not rest satisfied with

such observations and knowledge as the mere practice of their art re

quired, but would extend and combine their inquiries in such manner

as to make them the foundation of more general and comprehensive

views, and would tend to connect more intimately than heretofore the

science of geology with practical mining. This subject, so important

in its bearing upon the production of our mineral wealth, cannot be

too strongly recommended to the attention of the Geological and Me

chanical Sections of the Association. We venture, indeed, to hope
that the Newcastle meeting will be pre-eminently marked by the dif
fusion of much sound mining knowledge, flowing as must from the
                                      it
meeting together of the most experienced Cornish miners with thoseis

of Durham and Northumberland. We are further encouraged to in

dulge in this expectation from knowing that this meeting    honoured

by the presence of an Austrian nobleman, long valued by English geo

logists, and whose thorough acquaintance with mineral veins, and all

their complicated faults and changes, well entitle him to occupy the
ADDRESS BY MR. HURCHISON.                                             XXXIX

high station confided to him by his sovereign *. And here we cannot
but observe, that as, with all its mineral wealth, Great Britain is the
only country in Europe without a national school of mines, so much
the stronger is the call upon the British Association to promote the
analysis of every natural phenomenon and useful invention connected
with the art of mining. But while we make this appeal, we cannot

assemble in this neighbourhood without congratulating the University
of Durham on having led the way to the establishment of a school of

mines and engineering, in which the principles and knowledge of this
branch of science are regularly taught ; and we further feel gratified,

that so important a charge has been intrusted to men distinguished for
their scientific attainments, including in their numbers one of the earliest

promoters of the British Association, and one of its local secretaries at

fthis meeting .

   In the arrangements of the Association, the sciences of Mineralogy

and Chemistry have been united. Such an union may be justified, not
merely by its convenience in the distribution of our labours, but by
the close alliance which subsists between those sciences, in all that

concerns the connexion of chemical composition with crystalline forms,
presenting so many remarkable relations of very recent discovery, and
leading so rapidly, as Mr. Whewell has, on more than one occasion,
so clearly shown, to enlarged views of the true principles of minera-
logical qualification. But whilst we fully recognise the connecting
links which unite those sciences, we trust that this partial and tempo

rary separation, which the active and somewhat absorbing study of

palaeontology has almost necessarily occasioned, will not be of long
continuance, and that the laws of crystallization, which constitute its
alliance with another science, will in the progress of our knowledge
give as much importance to its connexion with the study of the cry
stalline structure of vast masses of the surface of the globe, as in the
most searching analysis of its minutest particles. Let not, however,
the exclusive advocates of any one theory of the proper relation of

 those sciences induce us to abandon inquiries so pregnant with re

markable conclusions, and which truly constitute the great basis and

framework of modern geology : for the more minute and laborious our

 investigations, the more certainly do we make out that many rocks

 which were once supposed to be made up of inorganic matter, are in
 truth composed of animal remains. And do we not look for the
 presence among us of a distinguished philosopher of Berlin, who,
 above all others, has eliminated this discovery, and who, by the
 powers of the microscope, has revealed to us the skeletons of millions

Xl KIGHTH REPORT 1838.

of once living and perfect animalcules inclosed in a single cubic inch
of solid stone. Well, indeed, may we quote the recent work of Lyell,
who, rejoicing in this great discovery, exclaims with the poet, --

                               " The dust we tread upon was once alive."

In noticing the labours of the Section of Geology and Geography, we
have to observe, with regret, that the latter science has not hitherto
received at our meetings that amount of attention to which it is justly
entitled. When we consider the advances which the science has re
cently made under the auspices of the Royal Geographical Society of
London, we cannot but lament that the British Association did not, at
an earlier period, request a report from some one of its members upon
the present state of our geographical knowledge, and upon those de
partments of it in which our researches might be most advantageously
prosecuted. The annual reports of the Secretary of the Geographical
Society, --particularly the last report of Capt. Washington, and the
admirable discourse recently delivered by its President, Mr. W. It.
Hamilton, -- have in great measure supplied this deficiency, making the
public acquainted both with much that has been done, and much that
remains to be worked out in this very important branch of knowledge.
But thougli we have thus been partially anticipated, we feel satisfied
that such a report, by bringing into prominent notice, before the whole
body of the Association, a statement of those great geographical pro
blems, whose solution is most specially desired or most easily effected,
may serve to secure for the promotion of geography the application of
some portion of those funds which have been hitherto exclusively
appropriated to other sciences.

    The merits of the Statistical Section have been already made mani
fest, by the collection of a great variety of very important data. On
this occasion we have to notice a very perspicuous and well-arranged
report, which appears in our Transactions, upon the statistics of a
large province of Hindostan, which sufficiently proves that a statist,
who would really contribute to the advancement of statistical science
by collecting facts in distant regions, must possess no slight qualifi
cations. In vain, in the absence of other essential branches of know

ledge, may he accumulate half-digested and ill-assorted observations ;
he must also combine, as in the person of Colonel Sykcs, the ac
quirements of the naturalist and geologist with those of an accom
plished soldier and of a man of general information.

    The accumulation of such facts is obviously a very fit part of the
labours of this Association, for they prove statistics to be truly a
science of method. This science occupies the same relation to politi

cal economy in its most comprehensive sense, which astronomical ob
servations held relatively to astronomy before the discoveries of me
ADDRESS BY MR. MURCFUSO.V.  xli

chanical philosophy enabled recent philosophers to make those early

observations perform a mighty part in testifying the great primal
truths of physical philosophy, and applying them to explain, and even
to predict, the varied motions and phenomena of the earth and hea

vens. Such a stage there must be in every inductive science, --one in

which immediate straining after comprehensive truths would be rash,

while the marshalling and classing phenomena is a task full of use
fulness and hope. Those only who mistake the stage of discovery in
which statistical observers are now placed, --who do not see that at

 present observation without premature speculation is the one and

 necessary step towards wide truths,-- will either be impatient to weave

 rash theories from our present imperfect materials, or to scoff at the

 unscientific character of those who labour patiently to increase and
 arrange them. The analogy between the early stages of astronomy
 and the actual position of statistics might be made more complete.
 The secular character of many classes of statistical observations neces

 sary to elucidate difficulties and disentangle truth might be easily de
 monstrated, but enough has been said for the purpose of indicating the
 really scientific character of this useful branch of our Institution.

    It has fallen to our precursors to comment on the advances in Natu

 ral History which have been made by the Section of Zoology and Bo
 tany; and although, on this occasion, we are not presented with any
 report upon these sciences, you all know how ably they have been
 elucidated at former meetings, by a Lindley, a Jenyns, and a Richard

 son ; and also with what vigour that section has prosecuted its inqui
 ries under the auspices of a Henslow and a Macleay. We must, how

 ever, here allude to the distinguished Northumbrian naturalist who
 occupies one of our vice-chairs, and express our hopes that Mr. Pri-
 deaux Selby may soon be called upon to contribute what is yet a de

 sideratum --a report upon the present state of the science of Orni

  thology.
     We have hardly ventured to allude to the separate proceedings of

  the Sections, for any discourse which should attempt to analyze their
  labours or to do justice to their usefulness would occupy too large a
  portion of your time. And besides this consideration, you, Gentlemen,
  are all aware, that these Sectional Meetings give rise to the Reports
  we have beeu considering, and also to the various practical researches
  which are carried out by the employment of your own funds, or by
  demands upon the country. If, therefore, the Reports constitute our
  high claim upon the literature of science, the proceedings of the Sec
  tions must be viewed as the fresh current of scientific enterprise, which
  continually vivifies and renovates the whole body of the Association.

       Among the investigations which are proceeding under the auspices
  of the Association, those which originated in the Committee of the
 xlH EIGHTH REPORT -- 1838.

 Medical Section, including several subjects of physiological interest
reported upon in the present volume, are remarkable for that spirit of
co-operative labour which has not been common in this country, and
which it is one of the happiest effects of these meetings to facilitate
and encourage. In like manner, a question of great interest as re
gards one of the most important products of our mineral wealth and

national industry, which had been discussed with more than common
warmth and earnestness at former meetings of the Association, has
been examined by an analysis, performed by one of the most distin
guished chemists of the present day, of the iron produced by the ap
plication of the hot and cold blast respectively ; which was undertaken
at the request of the Chemical Committee, combined likewise with
experiments, on an extensive scale, upon its relative strength and other
properties, which were commenced at the desire of the Mechanical

Section, by Messrs. Hodgkinson and Fairbairn, whose profound and
extensive knowledge of practical mechanics so well qualified them for
a task which they have executed with singular ability, enterprise, and
skill. The experiments on Waves, which are detailed in Mr. Russell's

report in our present volume, were likewise undertaken at the request,
and carried on by the aid of the funds of the Association. The accu
rate conception of a wave, its origin, propagation, and laws, is one of
the most difficult and fundamental of those which are required in
many of the delicate and embarassing inquiries of natural philosophy ;
and the experiments of Mr. Russell are well calculated to illustrate

and confirm many of the results which the mathematician has deduced
from the theory of fluid motion. Adhering, therefore, to our design
of mainly noticing those parts of our recent transactions which illus

trate the prominent points in our system of operations, we shall con
clude our remarks by noticing a report by Prof. Johnston, on a new
and curious subject of chemical inquiry, as affording a good example
of the execution of an object which the Association has had much in

view. The discovery that there exist definite chemical substances,
which are capable, under certain conditions, of assuming more than
one crystalline form, not deducible from nor referable to each other,

and accompanied with different physical properties ; and furthermore,
that there are instances of substances which are capable (independently
of any change of composition) of undergoing some internal transmu

tation sufficient to vary even their chemical affinities : these are dis
coveries which, pointing out a new road to the investigation of the
hidden mysteries of molecular attractions, peculiarly deserve to be
verified and extended. But it so happens that they have been little
studied or prosecuted in our country ; and, therefore, the Chemical
Committee, in accordance with one of the prominent designs of the

Association, selected this particular point as the subject of the Report
                 ADDRESS BY MR. MURCHISON.                      xlHi

on Dimorphism, printed in this volume, which gives a fuller statement

than we before possessed, of the facts arrived at by foreign experi

menters, the reasonings founded upon them, and the questions which
are left for future inquirers to solve. This is the precise point at

which the Association aims in the reports on the state of our know

ledge, which occupy the chief space in its publications ; they are not

intended, like    the articles in an encyclopaedia,  to teach and diffuse
science, but to                                      done, with a specific
                 advance it--to show what has been
view to what there remains to do-- to look forward to conquests to
come, rather than backward on those which are past --to survey the

border territory, and reconnoitre the debateable land. We have in

this, as in other respects, followed in the steps of him who gave the
original sketch of an Institution like the present. The great teacher

of inductive science and experimental philosophy, who first showed

the importance of knowing the lines which divide knowledge from
ignorance, and in the memorable list of desiderata which he drew

up, did more for "the progression of the sciences" than would have

been done by any discoveries he could have made.

Having thus endeavoured to elucidate, by reference to some portions

of its recent transactions, the comprehensive system of this Association,

and to mark the real value of its corporate influence, its pecuniary re

sources, and its concentrated intelligence, I would lastly notice that

part of the system which has given occasion to our present muster in
this prosperous and splendid city --the migratory character of our

meetings. In these migrations there is a double advantage ; the As

sociation gains much by them, and perhaps the places it visits do not

gain less ; for its visits may sometimes have the effect of drawing

genius from obscurity, and giving an impulse to powers which might

never have been exerted, and a direction to labours which might
otherwise have been misapplied. To our own body two great advan

houses of nature for the uses of art, the theatre of the most beautiful
of all the applications of science to the purposes of humanity -- without

having his curiosity awakened ? or contemplate those deep excavations,

the most accessible of any that have been carried into the bowels of

the earth, without being tempted to investigations which may lead
perhaps to a better understanding of the internal condition and struc
ture of our globe? Or can we survey the architectural creations
which surround us in the place in which we are assembled, where
order and magnificence have replaced confusion and meanness, with a
rapidity more resembling the illusions of an Arabian tale than the
sober anticipations of experience, without being encouraged in our
own efforts by witnessing such noble results of individual enterprise,
genius, and arrangement, which have associated the triumphs of art
with those of manufactures and commerce, and combined the refine
ments of wealth with the most varied productions of industry?

                             " Hie portns alii effodiunt ; hie alta theatris

                                Rupibus excidunt, scenis decora alta futuris."

  ·Finally, Gentlemen, there is another reason for these migrations,
which it would be highly ungrateful in us to overlook, which is equally

felt by the Association and by the place which it visits-- the warmth of

hospitality which we see these visits call forth, the union of hearts and
the excitement of kind and friendly feeling acting on all our objects,
like oil on the wheels of a vast and powerful machine, without which
its every movement would be retarded, and its whole power brought
to a stand. Never, indeed, can the vitality of this Association be im
paired, so long as the leaders who have borne the bark of science along
the waves shall lay stoutly to their oars. Assembling for a common
cause, and confiding in each other, may they ever glory in having
knit together all classes in the love of science; and whether presided
over, as on this occasion, by a noble duke, alike illustrious for his just
appreciation and generous encouragement of our pursuits, or in the
ensuing year by some one eminent in their cultivation, we shall, we
trust, go on waxing in strength, and holding out the cheering example
of a great and triumphant commonwealth of science I

But three points were at one time determined to be in one

would not only establish the fact of change in the position of
the earth's surface, but would enable us to determine, by an easy

been elevated, and the axis about which the elevation had taken
place. And with regard to the level of the sea,

twenty feet lower on some parts of the coast of England than
on others. And although men of science have very generally
seen the propriety of taking mean ivater, (the mean of low and
high water,) for the level of the sea, this selection, till confirmed
by some actual observations of facts, might appear arbitrary and

insecure. But if it be found that the mean water is at the same

level at different and distant points of the coast, where the low
water is at different levels, the propriety of taking mean water
for the level of the sea will probably be generally acknow
ledged.

   It may be observed, moreover, that the question of the per

manence or change of the height of any point of the coast (un
connected with a system of interior leveling) cannot be de
cided by observation, except by reference to the level of the sea ;
and therefore to determine what is the level of the sea is im
portant also to the geologist. On coasts where there are tides,
 the question of the stability of the land involves the question of
the laws of change of the water.

    2. For these reasons it was considered desirable to ascertain
by careful and exact levelling the relative heights of certain
points of the coast of England, and to refer these points to the
 sea by adequate tide observations. The British Association at
 its meeting in 1834, voted a sum of money (500/.) to be em
 ployed upon this object, and appointed a Committee to decide
 upon and direct the requisite operations. The same thing was
 done at the subsequent meeting in 1835. But the difficulty of
 fixing upon a plan of operations and of selecting the means of
 carrying it into effect by a joint deliberation of a large Com
 mittee scattered over the whole empire, prevented any active steps
 being taken towards the attainment of the object. At the meet
 ing at Bristol in 1836", in order to remedy this inconvenience,
 those members of the Committee who had the opportunity of
 conferring with each other after the separation of the Association
 took upon themselves the task of directing the execution of the
 plan. And it appeared to them desirable that a person should
 be selected to perform the leveling operation for the Associa
 tion, independently of any other surveys which might be going
 on ; for no materials collected for the purpose of any other sur
 vey could, in accuracy and other conditions, answer the purposes
 contemplated by the Committee. They considered themselves
 fortunate in being able to engage Mr. Bunt of Bristol in this ser
 vice, having entirely satisfied themselves of his accuracy and
 scrupulousness in observing, and of his clear apprehension of
 the nature of the operation. They also took the precaution of
 directing Mr. Bunt to execute a preparatory level from Bristol
              REPORT ON A LEVEL LINK.                               3

to Portishead, (a distance of eleven miles) and back to Bristol,
in order to ascertain the degree of accuracy which could be at
tained in this operation. The total amount of error resulting
from this operation was 1 "07 inches ; but there appeared grounds
for believing that the uncertainty of the result was very much
smaller than this quantity ; and this belief has been confirmed
by the general course of the subsequent operations.

   3. An excellent telescope level was constructed by Mr. Simms
for the Association, to be used on this service, and also a level
ing staff, for which however Mr. Bunt afterwards found it con
venient to substitute one of his own construction. This is de

scribed in the Appendix to this account.
4. The extremities of the line selected were on the north coast
of Somerset and the south coast of Devon, as affording the case
where coasts                                   seas could most easily be
brought into  belonging   to  Asenpoarrathte  and south line being thus

obtained, it was proposed to extend the operation to the east
ward, so as to obtain a third point under suitable conditions.
   The first line selected for leveling *, on a careful inspection of
the country, was one proceeding from Bridgewater up the river
Parret byLangport to Ilminster, Chard, Axminster, and thence
to the mouth of the river Axe, which was fixed upon as one of the
terminal points where tide observations were to be made. Bridge-
water was connected with the sea at the other extremity by a
line, which, skirting the Quantocks, reached the shore in the
first instance at Stolford opposite the Wick rocks ; but was after
wards carried further to the west in order to reach a more solid
rock, and terminated at East Quantocks head near Watchett.

   5. The leveling from Bridgewater to Axmouth was begun

May 16, and ended July 8, 1837. From Bridgewater to Wick
rocks the operations of leveling and preparing for tide observa
tions were carried on in October 1837- Tide observations were
made at Axmouth from January 4, to February 2, 1838, and at
Wick rocks from November 9, to December 9, 1837 ; and again
at Axmouth, simultaneously with Portishead, July 14 to 21,

1838.

The line thus leveled crossed no very great elevations, and
was for the most part very conveniently even. The highest
point was at White's House near Chard, where it attained a
height of 280 feet.
   6. The extension of the leveling process to any considerable
distance east or west of this line was a matter of difficulty ; the
ground in both directions consisting of a series of hills and val-

              · See Plate I., (the map).

leys of considerable magnitude. Such a country would require
to be leveled by a aeries of very short distances ; and this cir
cumstance would not only add greatly to the labour and expense
of the operation, but would render   dItouwbatsfutlh, eirnefoareverjyudmgeadtearidal

visable to be content with extending the level north-eastward
to Portishead and Bristol. By this means the east and west
extent of the surface surveyed became nearly equal to the ori
ginal north and south line ; and the level line which rests upon
the Quantocks at one extremity, crosses the Mendips and the
Leigh Down Hills, connecting a great number of different geo
logical formations.
7. This line from Bridgewater to Portishead was leveled
between May 15, and July G, 1838 ; and tide observations were
made at the latter place in May 1837, and July 1838.
8. Both in the leveling and in the tide observations, every

precaution was taken to avoid mistakes and to ensure accuracy-
As leveling operations of a very delicate kind have rarely been,
performed, and are nowhere sufficiently described, it is con
sidered worth while to record the method employed in this in
stance, and an Appendix is added containing this description.

It may here be observed, that the most important precaution,
that of making the distances of the staff from the telescope

equal in the fore observation and the back observation, was
throughout attended to ; and that all the lines were leveled in
both directions, proceeding from the beginning to the end of the
line, and then returning back fronv the end to the beginning.
9. By employing this method of verification, an apparent
error in the process is brought into view, for which it is difficult
to account, but which is so constant in its occurrence that we

cannot  cohneslipstssupipnostihnigs;i--t ttohadtepienndproocneseodmineg  general  cause. The
error                                                                      with   the leveling

operation along a line which is really level, the further end con
stantly appears, from the observation, to be the lower end ; and
the amount of this depression appears to increase with the di
stance. Hence, when we go to the end of a line and then return
to the starting point, we find the resulting elevation of the point
lower than its real elevation. The difference arising from this
cause is never considerable, but is always in the same direction,
and generally (in the same series of operations) greater in pro
portion as the distance is greater. Thus in the line from Bristol
IIto Portishead (11 miles) it was T07 inches; from Bridgewater

to Axmouth (40 miles) it was 4' inches; from Bridgewater to
East Quantockshead (16 miles) it was 1-94 inches; from Bridge-
Mater to Portishead (29 miles) it was 7'6 inches.

10. It is very difficult to explain the cause from which this
-seeming error arises, or even to conceive any cause from which

it can arise. The errors arising from the curvature of the earth,
and from any permanent refraction, are eliminated by the con
dition of equal distances in the fore and back observations. The
difference does not seem to arise from the effect of the sun's rays
on the instrument, for it is not removed by shading the instrument
with white paper ; nor from   any rise of the                   fore
and back observation, for it  is not confined  peg between the
                                               to soft ground.    It

appears to go on increasing with the time during which the ob
servations are continued, and is such an error as would result,

if we suppose that in every interval of time between the back and
the fore observation, something takes place by which the staff
is apparently (by refraction or otherwise) less elevated (or more
depressed) at the fore observation than it had been at the pre
ceding back observation. For these elevations are supposed to
be equal in the process ; and if the elevation of the fore point by
refraction or any other cause be the smaller, the point will ap
pear to be lower when it is really on the same level. This state
ment, however, is made rather with a view of explaining the
nature of this error than of assigning its cause.
1 1 . But since it is thus probable that this apparent error arises
from some constant and general cause, it is clear that we shall
get rid of its effects in each case by taking the mean of the first
and last results. We may therefore suppose the mean difference
of levels obtained by leveling between two points, first in one
direction and then in the other, to be accurate within limits very
much smaller than the errors above mentioned. We may venture
to confide in this result to a fraction of an inch.
12. The relative heights of the parts of the lines surveyed
being determined by the operations of which we have been speak
ing, marks were fixed at various points, by means of which the
position of the line now measured may hereafter be again dis

covered. These marks are the following. A place was selected
in the solid rock on the shore just below the fort at Portishead ;
and in this was inserted horizontally a cylinder of iron, two
inches diameter and fifteen inches long, containing in its centre
a brass wire one eighth of an inch in diameter, which marks
the position of the standard point, about eight feet above the
highest high water. This mark is on the property of James
Adam Gordon, Esq., of Naish House, who kindly gave per
mission for its being placed there. The mark at East Quan-
J.tockshead is

with a copper key passing through a transverse hole into a

similar block of granite, (also presented by the corporation of
Bridgewater) with a similar copper bolt, is the mark at Wick

at  the property  a similar block of granite, procured   by
    Axmouth is

Hallett, Esq., of that place, on whose property the mark
stands, and who has manifested a great disposition to forward
the operations in every way. The kindness and liberality of the
gentlemen who have been mentioned, on whose ground the marks
have been inserted, have much forwarded the undertaking, and
deserve the best acknowledgement the British Association can
make. These gentlemen are also willing to perpetuate the obli
gation which science thus owes them, by allowing themselves to
be considered the guardians of the permanent level marks thus
existing on their property ; and this is a kindness the more
valuable, since the British Association neither has nor can have
any valid right to such services. The marks of which this
statement contains the record, may hereafter be of great conse

quence in settling important questions of a scientific nature, if
their preservation be, as we do not doubt it will be, kept in mind
by the proprietors of the estates above mentioned.

   There is also a bolt inserted in the wall of the church at Ax
mouth ; and it is intended to place a similar mark in the church at
Uphill, a village situated where the level line crosses the western
extremity of the Mendips.
   With the permanent level points at Axmouth, Wick rocks,

and Portishead, the surface of the sea was compared by means of
tide observations made at first for a month at each of those places.

In pursuance of the views already stated, the mean of high and
low water was taken as representing the level of the sea. In
fact, this level of "mean water" is so nearly constant, that even
a few days will give its position with tolerable accuracy ; and
observations continued for a fortnight, which of course includes
spring tides and neap tides, give the result with great precision.

The first result was, that while the level of mean water at Ax
mouth and at Wick rocks did not differ by more than a small
fraction of an inch, the level of mean water at Portishead was
four inches and a half lower than at the other places. As how
ever it appeared possible that this difference might result from
the observations being made at different times of the year, further

observations were made simultaneously at Axmouth and at Por-
tishead, from July 16 to 30, 1838 ; the result of which was that
the level at Portishead is nine inches higher than that at Axmouth.

result of this examination was that the mean sea levelat Plymouth
was only one fiftieth of a foot higher in January than in July
Ilast : and it therefore appears certain that no annual inequality
of the tides is the cause of the difference.                            am led to ascribe
it to the circumstance, that in the observations of January, the
low water at Axmouth was taken within the bar at the mouth of
the river. In July, the low water, within this bar, was certainly
higher by a foot  or   two than  it was            on the outside              ; and
bar had altered   its  position  in the            intermediate               time,   Ithhaovueghlittthlee
doubt that it was in such a condition in January as to vitiate
the observations of low water. The observations of low water
made in July last, simultaneously with those at Portishead, were
made entirely outside the bar.
14. Taking the simultaneous observations made at Axmouth
and Portishead in July, 1838, as the most free from obvious objec
tions, we obtain the following results respecting the comparative
level of the sea at the two extremities of our line. The measures
of level were all referred to a certain zero point, assumed 100

feet below the point where the operations began. The level of
the mean tide above this zero was

or something less than nine inches. But the range of spring tides
at Axmouth was 5 feet above and below this level ; at Portis
head 17'87 feet above and below. Hence we have for the relative
levels of high and low water at spring tides
                                 High Water.                                  Low Water,

8 EIGHTH REPORT -- 1838.

Thus the sea at Portishead is at high water 13-6 feet higher and
at low water 12-14 feet lower than at Axmouth. And if we take

the extreme tides which occurred during the observations, the
differences are still greater ; for the greatest range of tides at
Axmouth was 10-8 feet, and at Portishead 41 -1 feet. And the

difference of the halves of this is 15-1 feet, which is greater by
2*23 feet than the difference of the ranges just employed. Also
these elevations of the ocean are nearly contemporaneous ; for
the high water at Axmouth occurs (at a mean) forty-four minutes
earlier than at Bristol, and at Portishead two minutes and three

quarters later than at Bristol.
   We have in these results a very strong indication that the
mean tide is what we must take as the level of the sea, for it

would be difficult to believe that the level of the sea is fourteen

feet higher at Portishead than at Axmouth, or sixteen feet lower,
which are the consequences of taking for the level high water
or low water at spring tides*.
We may add, that at another of our stations, the Wick rocks,
by a month's observations in November, 183J, the mean level
was 73'1I, or 3-8 incites higher than at Portishead. Perhaps a
portion of this difference may be due to the inevitable errors of
the operations. The range of the tides at this place is nearly
the same as at Portishead, and the time of high water (at the
mean) about thirty-seven minutes earlier than Bristol, and there
fore about seven minutes later than Axmouth.

   1 5 . The general result to which we are led is that the mean tide

must be taken as the level of the sea. This result had already
been arrived at by various persons. Capt. Denharn had asserted

it as the consequence of his observations at Liverpool ; and Mr.
Walker                       same conclusion by the tides of Ply
mouth.  had been led to the  it out as the result of the Plymouth

         I had also pointed
observations in the Philosophical Transactions for 1837-
16. But these conclusions were supported onlyby observations
made at a single place ; namely, by its appearing that the height
of mean tide was nearly constant, (varying at most only a few
Iinches) while both high and low water varied by many feet.

And so far as have yet seen the evidence, it seems probable that
though the change of the level of mean tide during a fortnight
be small, there really is some regular change of this level tide,
produced by the effects of the moon and sun. But the small-
ness of the changes of this level, as it is now announced, rests
upon quite dhTerent evidence, and appears to indicate a pertna-

nence of a more rigorous nature. The mean level of mean water
at one point of the toast of the island, taken for a semilunation
(and probably still more if taken for several lunations), may be
asserted to agree with the mean level at another point taken
in the same manner, within a very few inches. Perhaps the

agreement, if places situate on the open sea were taken, is still
nearer; for Portishead, and even Wick rocks, may be affected
by the narrowness of the Bristol Channel, which

                                                              appears
very probable that the level of mean tide at different places on
the open coast agrees as nearly as the operation of leveling can
determine.
   17. This result is not only very curious in itself, but pregnant
with important practical consequences. It is very clear, from the
slightest consideration of our results, that nothing but error and
confusion can result from processes, such as have often been em
                         present time, in which
fprloomyed"  up to the   of the sea," this level     heights are determined
              the level                              being understood to be

that of low water spring tides. Such heights are not measured
from a level at all, but from a surface of which some parts are
sixteen feet lower than others within the limits of our operations,
and probably above twenty feet, if we take the extreme cases on
the shores of our island. The only method of stating heights
which can have any pretensions to accuracy, is that of reckoning
them from a conventional fixed datum upon the solid land ; to
which datum the sea as well as the land must be referred by
proper leveling operations.
   18. As a specimen of the doubt and confusion which have
hitherto prevailed on this subject, I may quote a passage from
Mr. Telford's report on the project of a ship canal, intended
to connect the Bristol Channel with the English Channel, and
                                           course as our level line. He says

      may add that this result is certainly erroneous ; for it gives
the high water in Bridgewater Bay only two feet higher than on
the south coast of Devon ; whereas by our observations, which
certainly cannot err a foot, the former level is at least fourteen feet
higher than the latter. The difference, which is perhaps not to
be wondered at in rough leveling such as that performed in a
preparatory survey for a canal, is twentyfold greater than our
operations, carried backwards and forwards, and only differing
one or two inches in the result, allow us to consider as possible.
19. We may observe, in conclusion, that the result of our
operations, namely, that the mean tide in different points of the
coast is at the same level within a few inches, is of no small
practical value. For this being so, the level of any place within
a moderate distance of the coast may be determined, for the
purposes of canals or railroads, or any similar undertakings,
with reference to the level of places hundreds of miles distant,
by taking a fortnight's observations of high and low water, and
then leveling a few miles into the interior of the country.

   20. It may perhaps be said that the conclusions thus stated de
pend upon a single comparison ; that of the south shore of the
Bristol Channel, with the north shore of the English Channel.
When itis recollected that there are, omitting thesmaller flexures,
some hundreds of miles of coast between the two extremities of

peachable accuracy. But am at the same time quite ready to
admit that it would be highly desirable to have the result corro
borated by other comparisons of the same kind, especially by a
comparison of the east and west shores of England. For this
purpose it might be desirable to carry a level line from Bristol,
which is            connected with   our operations, to London. The
expense   already
          of this,  if performed in  the same manner as that which I

have described, would be great ; but it appears to be worth con
sideration, whether this expense might not be much reduced by

Iand in like manner to Plymouth, Liverpool, and other principal

ports of the empire, would be desirable, in another view. As
have already said, we cannot speak with accuracy of any level
except a conventional one ; and as each of these ports has its
own tide scales to which the rise and fall of the sea's surface is
referred, it would be desirable to compare the absolute position

of these scales with regard to a level surface. We may in this
manner, and in no   other, learn the true       form of the
time ; besides the  practical advantages,         which, as           oIcehaanveatsaaindy,

island.                               that the   kingdom    of the    Netherlands

already possesses such a system of levels, by which all points of
its surface are referred to a certain zero at Amsterdam.
Whether such an extension of the level line measured for the

Association be desirable, may        Ibnetsht ebemedaentetrimmineeId     by  the Com

has already been done possesses      no small value, being, so far as I
Iam aware, the first attempt of the kind, executed with great care,

and see every reason to think, with great accuracy.

Account of the Leveling              Operations between the                   Bristol
   Channel and the English           Channel, by Thomas G.                   Bunt.

Previously to my commencing the leveling which I had re
ceived instructions from Professor              Whewell to undertake on
account of the British Association,
                                                I was desirous of deriving

such assistance as might be obtained from any published account
of a similar enterprise, in which due attention had been paid to
the niceties which the operation                 requires, and the best means
for ensuring accuracy ascertained
                                                and pointed out. All the or
                   on                are of the most elementary and su
dinary treatises  and  leveling

character  Sheerness                       about to engage. This memoir
           to that in
of Captain Lloyd I regard as one of considerable value, and
have derived from it much information and assistance. Most

of his arrangements appear to me to be very judicious, and se
veral of  them I  have cither                      imitated.    On one im
portant                        adopted or          to dill'er  from him, to
          point,  however, I   am obliged

which 1 shall have occasion to advert presently.
The instruments made for this undertaking were a spirit-level,
and brass leveling-staff, by Simms, London. The telescope,
though only 14 inches in length, was found to bear the high
magnifying power of 26 so well under all circumstances, that
the other eye-piece with which it is furnished was never em
ployed. The glass spirit-tube is so nicely ground, that the
position of the air-bubble is sensibly altered by raising or lower

ing cither end of the tube 100(xi0th part of an inch. In the focus
of the telescope are a horizontal and two vertical hairs, which
latter afford a very convenient means of measuring the distance
of a station, within about the Tjjjyth part of the truth, by count
ing the number of intercepted divisions of a scale made for the
purpose, and held horizontally over the station by an assistant.
The legs which were made to support the level, although very
strong, were found to vibrate so much from the action of the
wind, as to render it difficult to                 correct observation, ex
cept in perfectly calm weather.            take a   also next to impossible

                                           It was

to level the spirit-tube, unless by accident, for want of a slower
       more delicate motion than           that afforded
and                                        a very strong   by the    parallel
plate  screws. I therefore ordered                        stool to  be made

by a carpenter, the top of which was a thick board 12 inches
in diameter. The level was then detached from its former sup
port, and fastened to a circular piece of mahogany, which rested
by three foot-screws on the top of the stool, and was firmly se
cured to it by a stout wooden screw, with a nut at bottom,
passing through both the circular boards. On trying this appa
ratus, I found that a more delicate vertical motion was still
wanted, which was at length perfectly attained by causing one
of the three foot-screws to rest on a small brass lever at a very
short distance from the fulcrum, while the farther end, furnished
with a fine screw and milled head, communicated about T'jth of its
own vertical motion to the foot-screw of the level, affording a
very simple and delicate means of adjustment.
The level, although now incomparably steadier than before,
was still found liable to disturbance from the wind, when it blew
with any considerable force ; to protect it from which we car
        REPORT OS A LEVEL LINK.                                       IJ

rietl with us a piece of canvas, 6 feet square, nailed to two poles,
which were sharpened at the bottom, to enter the ground. This
screen being held firmly by two men on the windward side of

the instrument, sheltered it so completely, that I was able to
proceed in windy weather, with but little interruption.
The brass leveling staff was employed in leveling between
Bristol and Portishead ; but being found inconvenient, and liable
        Ioustubosfeqreupenatilry,
to get                             was obliged   to be laid aside. The staff
which                               constructed  and used, is of wood, 9 feet

long, and 2 inches wide, a single piece of straight- grained oak.
On the face are two different scales of equal parts. One is the
common scale of feet and hundredths of a foot ; the other has
larger divisions, in the proportion of 19 to 16 nearly, or more
exactly, as 1-18702 to 1 : an aliquot ratio of the scales having
been purposely avoided. Both of these are reckoned upwards
from a common zero at the bottom of the staff. The centesimal

divisions of the foot are produced in strong black lines towards

the left, and large figures denoting feet and tenths placed against
them, so that the height may be read off at the telescope to the

rcotn Part °f a f°ot ilt a distance of 150 or 200 yards. These

marks are also useful for directing the assistant where to fix the
vane, by calling the division to him,
                                                 especially when the  reading
was near the top of the staff. A                 stud of wire, about  half an

inch long, projects from the bottom of the staff, and a hole is
bored to receive it in the top of the peg which is driven into the
ground at every station, and on which the staff rests during the

observation. A small spirit-cup with a glass cover, screwed to
the lower part of the staff, serves to adjust it to a vertical posi
tion, in which it is held fast by a clamp attached to three strong
legs, jointed and folding together, in the usual manner.
The vane is a small mahogany box, about 3 inches in each
dimension, open at the ends to admit the staff, which slides
through it. Two large wooden screws at the back of the vane
clamp it very firmly to the staff, and preclude all danger of
shifting. In front is a frame of brass, about 2 inches square,
sliding within an outer frame of brass screwed to the vane, with
a range of motion of about half an inch, either upwards or down
wards, being moved by a large vertical screw with a milled head

working through the lower part of the outer frame. A square
aperture, corresponding with the inside of this frame, is cut
through the mahogany, in order that the divisions of the staff

may be seen. A small ivory door moving on a hinge, is fitted
into the sliding frame, on which are drawn two thick black lines,
crossing each other at a small angle, and a black ring with a
white circular spot within, at the centre, or intersection. At
14 EIGHTH REPORT 1838.

tached to the inside of the sliding frame, and exactly behind the
centre of the white circle, is a vernier, nearly in contact with
the face of the staff, which divides the hundredth of a foot into

five parts, of 20 ten-thousandths each, so that the observation is
read off and recorded to four decimal places. The white circular

spot, and the angular spaces between the lines, may be bisected by

Ithe horizontal wire of the telescope, with great exactness. In

favourable weather, have usually found the average error, or
the difference of a single reading from the mean of the number
taken to be about jyoth of an inch, on a distance of 88 yards,
or about a quarter of a second of angle. (See Wood-cut at the
end of this paper.)
When the vane was raised so near the top of the staff as to be
out of the reach of the hand, the adjusting screw was worked by
a long fork of stout wire thrust into holes made in the milled

head to receive it. A groove made in the upper part of the
staff receives the fork when it is not in use.

  In leveling, I proceeded regularly in the following manner.
Two equal distances, usually of 4 chains or 88 yards each, ha
ving been measured forwards from the last station, the level was
placed at the end of the first distance, and, at the second, a
strong wooden peg driven firmly into the ground, for the fore
Istation, the level being exactly midway between the stations.

When, (as happened in a very few instances,) was prevented
from making the fore and back distances equal, compensating
unequal distances were immediately afterwards taken, so that
the sums of the two sets of distances were kept equal through
out. The staff being held vertically on the back station peg, by
the means before described, and the first observation taken, the

height was read off and written down by the assistant in a rough
minute-book which he carried for the purpose. The vane was
then purposely thrown out,            by turning back
re-adjusted, and a second              reading taken.  the  screw,  the level
                                                             these  readings
                                                        If
agreed within 20 lO.OOOths (about TJjth of an inch), the staff
was brought forward to me, when 1 read off and inserted the
last reading, according to both scales, in separate columns of my
book ; the mean of both readings was also inserted in a third

column, after my assistant and myself had called over and com
pared the last reading. The assistant then read off and called
Ito me the last reading from the large scale, as a check on what

  had entered in my book. The needle bearing and distance in
links, being aiso inserted in their respective columns, completed
the back observation. The process in taking the fore observation

A rigid adherence to this system rendered it improbable that
                                      be written down,  without immediate

curred. Had it even been so, a discrepancy must have existed
between the columns of different scales, which would have been

readily detected on casting up and comparing the totals, at the
end of the day. From erroneous readings, therefore, it is evi
dent, there was little or nothing to fear ; but these are far from
being the only, or the principal sources of error. On one or
two occasions, we were very near committing a mistake, in be
ginning at a different station from the one on which we had
previously closed. This would have occasioned an error, per
haps of large amount, which could only have been detected by
the second and independent series of levels, taken over the

ground in an opposite direction. For this reason alone, I should

not consider it safe to depend on one course of levels only,
whatever may have been the precautions used to guard against
error.
   The total length of my line of leveling between Portishead
and Axmouth, besides the branch lines to Bristol and East
Quantockshead, is about 74 miles. This distance was divided
into separate stages ; each of which, averaging about 10 miles
in length, was twice leveled over, first in one direction,
then in the opposite, before the next stage was commenced.                    and

                                                                                It

is very remarkable, that with a few partial exceptions, the heights
of all the points touched upon by both scries, came out less by
the levels   returning, than by the levels going .-     so that the first
station, or  starting-point, always appeared lower
                                                        when I returned,
than it was at my setting out. But as the height of this point
is the same in both cases, the error must, of course, be thrown

on the distant point, or station at which the returning levels
commenced, which reverses the first apparent differences, and
makes all the heights in the second series progressively greater
than those in the first, the most distant point having the greatest
error. The following table gives the differences thus found at
20 points along the line between Portishead and Axmouth, the
height, in every instance, coming out greater from the series of
levels returning towards Portishead.

   After the most careful examination of every circumstance
which could possibly tend to occasion these curious differences,

I am inclined to believe that they,arise principally from rapid

variations in the amount of atmospheric refraction which occur
during the time that elapses in a single observation, and that
the progression of the error is in some way or other connected
with the progressive changes of the average temperature during
the course of the day, from about eight in the morning till six
or seven in the evening, -- the usual limits of my working hours.
These variations in the refraction are much greater and more
sudden in summer than in winter, especially during the forenoon
of a hot and sultry day, when there are frequent alternations of
cloud and sunshine, and copious exhalations of moisture from

the ground. On such occasions I have sometimes known the

sudden clearing away of a cloud from the sun followed almost
in an instant, by a change in the apparent height of the vane
amounting to ygth of an inch, or more, on a distance of only 88

yards. At other times the change has been more gradual, so

that several successive readings, taken at intervals of two or
three minutes, have all either increased or diminished progress -
ively. Different seasons or states of the weather may therefore
fully account for the more rapid increase of these differences at
certain times than at others, such as the above table presents, in
which the errors are found proportionablygreaterbetween Portis-
head and Bridgewater, than between Bridgewater and Axmouth;

thelatterdistancehavingbeen levelled over in the summer of 1837,
and the former in that of 1838. For the same reason it appears
much better to divide the distance into stages and finish them
one at a time, than to go over the whole in one direction, before
returning upon any part of it ; it being much more probable
that errors depending on the state of the atmosphere will balance
each other in the former than in the latter case.
My own experience, therefore, leads to the conclusion, that
no levelling can be expected to give a correct result, unless it
be performed in opposite directions, and the mean of both re
sults be taken ; instead of depending, as Captain Lloyd appears
Ito have done, on the consistency of separate sets of successive
readings.  have myself invariably found (as that gentleman
also did.) the agreement of these to be almost identical, both in
the going and in the returning series, notwithstanding the great
progressive difference of these two series of levels from each
Iother ; of which progression not the smallest trace is discover
able in the separate  columns of the same series.  I     have entered
the more minutely     into this subject, because      am not aware
that any one has described, or even noticed the existence of

such differences before ; and should feel much interest in reading
the statements of any experienced person who had been engaged
in a similar undertaking, and had conducted it with sufficient
care to render the law of the errors in any degree discernible.

The epoch here spoken of is that transit of the moon, anterior
to the tide, and to which the tide is referred. The question ex
amined is, whether we obtain the closest accordance with the
observations by taking a transit one day, one and a half day, or
Itwo days anterior to the tide which we consider.
   Although    have given the  answers to these questions in      the
memoir in the                  Transactions already referred

here lay before the Association the curves*, the comparison of
which exhibits these answers, and exhibits indeed the result of

my discussions more clearly and exactly than words can do.
   The careful examination to which we have subjected the Bristol
tides, has shown us that there are scarcely any irregularities in
these phenomena which we have not reduced, or may not hope to
reduce, to empirical laws, which laws constitute the first step to
     solution of our great tidological                Iemxpalyanaadtdionthaotf

the                                     principles.
the Report on Waves by Sir John Robison and Mr. Russell, inclu
ded in the reports of the seventh meeting of the Association, con
tains highly valuable materials, likely to assist us in the further
prosecution of this subject. The unexplained residue, which, in
our method of discussion, exhibits the difference between obser

vation and our tables as hitherto corrected, although it is small
(upon the average two or three minutes in time, and as many
inches in height in a tide of forty feet), is so far seemingly subject

Ito some rule as to offer a promise of additional laws of cor

rection, and should be desirous of discussing this residual
quantity with such an object.

rewarded for the trouble and expense incurred on account of it.
   Forty pounds was voted for this instrument ; of this 30/. has
been paid to Mr. Osier. The attendant expenses on it have
amounted to 20/. This includes the erection of an apartment
of wood in which the instrument works, carriage from Bir
mingham, clock for the register, and sundry other expenses

of a minor kind.
As the daily register must be carefully attended to it will be

before the Section, as an approximative result, the march of the

   On the 1st of January, 1839, we shall have completed 2 years
of these hourly observations, when general results, entitled to
more confidence than those deduced from                                   a single year, will

The general results, which accompany this communication,
and which are exhibited in Plates 10, 11, 12, must be consi

dered merely as corrections of similar statements exhibited in
my first report ; the former being arrived at by a more exten

the hourly temperatures, on the supposition that they may be
represented by parabolic abscissa, are much nearer than in the
similar table and plate before given.

   Of £50 voted for these observations, £35 has been spent in
defraying the expenses attendant on them up to June last,
leaving a balance of £15 ; part of this has been expended in aid
of Mr. Osier's wind-gauge.
The labour attendant on the reduction and discussion of the

observations made hourly with these last-named instruments

being now very considerable, it becomes necessary to employ
Icompetent persons to assist in working out the ordinary arith

28 EIGHTH REPORT-- 1838.

Tables, Sfc, of Observations made with Professor Whewell's

   Anemometer at Mount Wise, Devonport. From November
   1837 to June 1838, inclusive.
   These Tables comprise: -- 1. The observations as daily re

corded. 2. The reduction of these observations. 3. A sum

mary Table, in which the general result is condensed. Lastly,
The charts and general type of the wind, as shown by the re
spective reductions and summary.

   Plate 13, contains the general summary : the month of No
vember 1837 is coloured blue, and marked 11 ; December is red,
and marked 12 ; January 1838 is again blue, and marked 1. The
remaining months continue to be marked 2, 3, &c. The breaks
in the continuation of the lines show when the instrument was
under repair. The direction of the wind is here only recorded
and indicated by dotted lines.

    The black dotted lines show the resultant magnitude and di
rection for each month ; the five black lines are continued re
sultants, viz., that marked 1, 2, is the resultant of 11 and 12,
that marked 1, 2, 3, of 11 and 12, and so on to the last marked
1 to 8 j which is the resultant of 8 months. The scale of this
Plate is that of the 400 equal parts to the inch.

METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS AT PLYMOUTH.                               37

The following calculations with the accompanying Plates re
present the result of observations made at Plymouth, with an
Anemometer of Mr. WhewelPs construction. This instrument
gives what Mr. Whewell calls the integral effect, of the wind,
namely, a space proportional to that which a particle of air would
pass over in each day in consequence of the wind, taking into
account both the strength of the wind and the time during which
it blows. These integral effects being put together according to
their directions, each day beginning at the end of the preceding so
as to form a continuous line, as is done in the Plates, we obtain
the path of the wind for each month, or for a longer time. The

A Memoir on the Magnetic Isoclinal and Isodynamic Lines
in the British Islands,                        Observations by Professors
Humphrey Lloyd and                   Jforohmn  Phillips, Robert Were Fox,
Esq., Captain James Clark Ross, R.N., and Major Ed
ward Sabine, R.A. By Major Edward Sabine, R.A.,
F.R.S.

At the meeting of the British Association, held at Cambridge
in the year 1833, a resolution was passed, recommending that a
series of determinations of the magnetic dip and intensity should
be executed in various parts of the United Kingdom.
Early in 1834 Professor Lloyd, who had attended the meet
ing at Cambridge, proposed to me to unite with him in carrying
Ithe recommendation of the Association into effect as far as re
garded Ireland.  was at that time employed on the staff of
the Army in the south-west district of Ireland, and found
it not incompatible with other duties to undertake that portion
of the island. Our observations were continued at intervals

throughout that year, and until the autumn of 1835, in the sum

                                                                                       Lloyd, was
made to the British Association, assembled in that year in Dub
lin, and was printed in 1836 in the fourth volume of the Asso

ciation Reports. A re-calculation of the Irish results, incorpo
rating the observations which have been made since in that part
of the United Kingdom, has been furnished by Mr. Lloyd, and
occupies its appropriate place in this report.

   Mr. Robert Were Fox, who was present at the Dublin meet
ing in 1835, brought with him an apparatus for magnetic ob
servations on a new construction of his own invention, with

which, after the meeting, he made several observations of the
dip in the course of a tour in the west and north of Ireland.
These observations, with others made on his return through
Wales, were published in 1836, in the report of the Royal Po
lytechnic Society of Cornwall for 1835. Several of these ob
servations were made in houses, and were consequently liable

to disturbing influences. Mr. Fox has selected eight deter
minations of the dip in Ireland, and nine in Wales, as free from
objection on this account; and with his permission they are
now incorporated in the present report.
Having obtained two months leave of absence from military
duty in the summer of 1836, 1 employed them in extending the

tributed over that country ; forming the basis of a memoir on
the Scottish Isoclinal and Isodynamic lines, which was printed
in the fifth volume of the Association Reports, and published in
1837.

   In the same summer Professor Lloyd commenced the mag
netic survey of England by a series of observations at fourteen
stations, principally in the midland and southern districts ; these
observations have not been hitherto published, and will be found
in their place in the present memoir.

    The interest which had been excited at the meetings of the
British Association by the Irish and Scotch Magnetic Reports,
induced Professor Phillips to provide himself with an apparatus
for the dip and intensity ; having particularly in view the inves
tigation of the influence which he deemed it possible the con
figuration of the surface, or the geological character of the di
strict, might have on the position or on the inflexions of the lines

representing these phenomena. In the summer of 1837 Mr.
Phillips visited and observed at twenty-four stations in England,

chiefly in the northern district ; these observations arc now first
published.

   In the same summer Mr. Fox determined the dip at twenty

stations in the north of England and south of Scotland ; and in
the summer of 1838 at eight stations in the south of England,
extending from London to the Scilly islands j at some of the
latter stations he also observed the intensity : these observa
tions form part of the present memoir.

   In August 1837 Captain James Ross commenced a series of

magnetic observations, which he continued almost uninterrupt
edly until the close of 1838; they extend over England, Ire
land and Scotland generally, and comprehend fifty-eight sta
tions. His observations of the dip and of the intensity are in
cluded in the present memoir.

   Lastly, between August 1837 and October 1838, 1 have taken
advantage of an interval between military duties, to observe the
dip and intensity at twenty-two stations, distributed for the
most part round the coasts of England and Wales, and extended
into Ireland and Scotland for the purpose of accomplishing a
more complete connexion of the different series.

   It has been the wish of the four gentlemen connected with
me in this undertaking, that I should draw up the memoir of

what our joint labours have accomplished. Our observations
have been now carried over the whole extent of England, Ire
land and Scotland ; and may be considered in their combination,
and by their extent, to obtain, in some measure, the character
of a national work ; presenting to the immediate requisitions of

                      Division I.--Dip.

   In the memoir on the magnetical observations in Ireland
(British Association Reports, vol. v.), Mr. Lloyd has noticed

the discrepancies which have been occasionally found in the re
sults of observations of the dip made at the same station with
different instruments. The observations of Captain Ross at
Westbourne Green, which are there related, place these discre
pancies in the strongest light. Captain Ross employed eight
needles, making from eight to ten observations with each, each
observation consisting of eighty readings ; i. e. of ten in each
of the eight usual positions. The dip at Westbourne Green,
resulting from each of these needles considered separately, va
ried from 69°    0l'-5 to 69°                      On these    discordances Mr.
Lloyd remarks    as follows :        "42T'h-6u. s  it appears  that there is a dif

ference amounting to 41' in the results of two of the needles

used; and that the difference is very far beyond the limits of the
errors of observation, will appear from the fact, that the extreme
difference in the partial results with one of these needles, B (1),
does not amount to 4/$, while with the other, (P), the extreme
difference is only 2'. In fact, it so happens, that these very
needles which differ most widely in their mean results are those
in which the accordance of the partial results is most complete.
Of the eight results obtained with needle P, there is one only
which differs from the mean of the eight by a single minute j
and yet the mean of all the observations with this needle differs
by more than 20' from the mean of any of the others, while its
                                      of the  entire series
exc"esTsheasbeovediftfhereenmceesan  cannot    be ascribed   amounts to 25'.

netism in the apparatus, for three of the needles (I, P and R)
were of the same dimensions, and were used with the same cir

cle, and yet their results, as we see, are widely discordant. We
must seek then in the needles themselves the cause of these

perplexing discrepancies ; and we are forced to conclude that
there may exist, even in the best needles, some source of con
stant error which remains uncorrected by the various reversals

usually  made ;  and  that accordingly             no  repetition  of     observa

Iproximation to the absolute dip."

       may add to the preceding remarks, that the discordances
thus noticed far exceeded the limit of either diurnal or irregular

fluctuations of the dip in England, as far at least as these phse-
nomena have hitherto been the subject of observation.

of the discrepancies in question, and of similar discordances ex
perienced elsewhere, were occasioned by the axle, on which the
needle rests on the agate planes, not being perfectly cylindrical.
Careful observers on the continent had already noticed defects of
workmanship in this respect ; and had been led thereby to have
needles made, in which the axle, instead of being permanently
fixed to the needle, was secured in its place merely by strong
friction, and could be taken out, turned a portion of a circle on
its own centre of rotation, and replaced; thus enabling the
points of the circumference of the axle in contact with the sup

porting planes to be varied in successive trials. At Captain
Ross's desire, Mr. Robinson undertook to have four needles of
this description made, for one of which Mr. Frodsham, whose
chronometers are so well known for their excellence, undertook

to make the axle.     On these needles                       being  acxolme,p--lettehda, t  they were
tried each in four  different positions                     of the                          is to say,

the  axle being secured,   an observation                            of the   d: i--p  was  made in
the  usual manner, and    with the usual                           reversals           the  axle was

and fourth change, was made in the position of the axle, and the
dip observed at each. The process thus described was twice

repeated with each needle. Of the four, Mr. Frodsham's axle

proved the best ; but the trial clearly manifested in all the im
perfection which had been apprehended. The results with the
needle furnished with Mr. Frodsham's axle are given in the
subjoined table, where that needle is designated as No. 1.

   With this experience Mr. Robinson undertook to replace the
axles of the other three needles with three which should be the

workmanship of his own hands. On these being tried, the dis
crepancies of each in the four positions were less than of any of
the four axles in the former trial, but still amounted to several
minutes. The results of the best of Mr. Robinson's axles have
been selected for illustration, and are those of No. 2. in the sub

joined table.

Trials of the Axles of the under-mentioned Dipping Needles.

   The observations having been made in a house, the dip ob
served is not the true dip in London. This is immaterial, as the
object of the experiment was solely the agreement or otherwise
of the results in the different positions of the axle.

    Had the axles been perfect, the same dip should of course
have been given in all positions of the axle : we perceive, how
ever, that the differences in the one needle amount to above 40',
and in the other from 7' to 11'. The results of these experiments
fully impressed Mr. Robinson with the necessity of employing
more effectual means for ensuring a true figure to the axles of
dipping needles ; and in several which he has since made, and
which have been carefully examined, he has proved successful.

    Having exhibited the distrepancies of the earlier needles, it
may be satisfactory to show the improvement in some of the later
ones ; and for that purpose the following observations are given
with needles which were afterwards employed in the general ob
servations of this report. The axles of these needles, being made

to revolve, were successively tried in four positions, which were, as
nearly as could be guessed, a quarter of the circumference apart ;
had they been precisely so, the needle must have rested on the
same points of the axle, in the 1st and 3rd positions, and in the
2d and 4th, (as the poles are reversed in each observation), and
the results in those positions should have been the same ; but
as this can have been only approximately done, each position may
be considered as bringing a different set of bearings into play.
The observations were made us before, in Mr. Robinson's house,
and have therefore no reference to the true dip.

between the magnetic meridian and its normal plane, the needle
rests successively on all points of the axle comprised in por
tion of the quadrant equivalent to the complement of the dip

of the reversals of the
gone through at any part of the earth on or near the line of no
dip, the whole of the quadrant is thereby subjected to exami
nation. In such situations, consequently, this method affords
the means of examining the whole circumference of the axle ;
and in all other localities, as much of the circumference aa

amounts to four times the complement of the dip. Whatever
portion in the latter cases remains unprovided for, may be tested
by converting the needle, temporarily, into one on Mayer's
principle. This can easily be done by the application of a little
wax ; the quantity of which may be varied at pleasure, so as to
correspond with the weights of different sizes, by which, in
Mayer's method, the angles of inclination, from which the dip
is computed, are varied in successive observations. By one or
other of these processes the true dip at any station can be
obtained from any and every inclination of the needle; and every
part of the circumference of the axle can consequently be tested.

   In what has been said, it has been presumed that there
is no magnetism in the circle itself, as, should such exist, it
would certainly become the source of discordance in the results
derived from different azimuths, or from different weights, in
dependently of any defect in the axle ; and so far, therefore,
the agreement of the results in such trials (should they be found
to agree) indicates with great probability the freedom of the
circle from magnetism as well as the goodness of the axle. But
Mr. Lloyd has employed and has described in a subsequent
part of this report an independent and much more delicate mode
of examination for magnetism in the circle.
The customary provision of two needles for each apparatus
does not alone                                    tothewheicrrhorsI  which

are accordant, it is thus far satisfactory, that it certainly is not
probable that both needles should have accidentally exactly the
same imperfection ; but if they differ, the observer has no guide
as to which is to be preferred ; whilst their mean result cannot
usually be more than an approximation to the true dip, for it is
also improbable that the two needles should have an exactly
equal amount of error in opposite directions. As a means of
detecting magnetism in the limb, two needles are of no more
avail than one ; because both are directed to the same point of

the circle when observed with at the same station, and, if a dis
turbing influence exists, both will be subjected to the same error.

Those who are desirous of making accurate observations,
should regard the preliminary examination of the axle and limb

of the apparatus they employ as an indispensable precaution.

When these points have been satisfactorily examined, and the
instrument is found correct, the natural magnetic direction,
                  to azimuth and inclination, is the most advan
both in  regard
tageous  for the  observation of the dip. Il is in the preliminary
examination, that the method devised by Mayer, and that of
varied azimuths, are chiefly valuable*.

   It may now be satisfactory to exhibit the observations that

have been made at Westbourne Green in the years 1837 and

1838 with different circles and approved needles. (Table III.)

The greater part of these instruments were made by Mr. Robin
son since his attention has been particularly directed to the cir
cumstances above noticed; and those who will take the trouble

to compare their performance with that of the several needles
employed by Captain Ross at the same station in 1835,
will have an opportunity of judging how great an improve
ment has been effected in our English dipping needles since
that period. Of the two other instruments not made by Robin
son, one was made by Gambey for Captain Fitz Roy, of the
Royal Navy, and kindly placed by that officer at my disposal, to
be employed in the observations in this report. The excellence
of the dipping needles of this artist is too well known to need
any comment      in this    place. The other            instrument was made by
                Jordan      of Falmouth, the

Fox to make the dip apparatus on the construction which he
has devised, and which is described in a paper in the 3rd vol.
of the "Annals of Electricity, &c." Mr. Fox's needles do not rest
on a cylindrical axle supported by planes, but the axle is ter
minated by exceedingly fine and short cylindrical pivots, which

the Athenaeum at Plymouth, and     at Ham,     near London,
ceeding the truth by about half a  degree.                       to   have "given dips ex
tion  would trace this error to imperfection  It is probable    that   a careful examina
of a  contrary character would exist when
points of its                                 in the axle; and        in such  case  errors

               circumference, and may have influenced the              determinations at
               Everard's foreign stations. By the methods             pointed out in this
report,  a table of errors
which    its results might  at  different dips might be formed for this needle, by
                            be  corrected. This additional trouble would be well

bestowed in perfecting this extensive series, on which so much pains have
already been expended.

work in jeweled holes. By means of the " deflectors " which
make a part of Mr. Fox's apparatus, the dip may be deduced
from readings at various parts of the circle, and there is there
fore the same opportunity of discovering errors caused by mag
netism of the circle, or by imperfection in the bearings of the
axle, as the azimuthal and Mayer's methods furnish in needles
of the ordinary construction : the jewel-plate itself is also made
to revolve, so that the resting-places of the axle in the jewels
may be changed at pleasure. The performance of these needles
III.sufficiently indicates the great care bestowed on their workman
ship. As the different observations in Table      include an in

terval of eighteen months, they have been rendered more strictly
comparable by the addition of a column, in which they are re
duced to the common epoch of the 1st January, 1838, by ap
plying a proportional part of the annual rate of decrease of the
dip in London at this time, which, from reasons that will be
assigned hereafter, is considered to be 2'"4.

  The subjoined tables, IV., V., VI., VII., VIII., exhibit in de

tail the azimuthal examinations which have been made of some
of the instruments employed in the observations contained in this
report ; it has appeared the more desirable to give these tables,
because the practice of this method is new in this country.

                   Annual Alteration of the Dip,

The observations of dip included in this report, extend over
an interval of four years and upwards. To reduce these to
common epoch, we require to                                        know the amount                        of           ;
which the dip undergoes from                                                                              the                         a

decrease of three minutes was provisionally assumed but we

dip at each of those stations, corresponding to every tenth year,

not been published, believe, in this country, have subjoined

The differences which appear in the progression and rate of
the annual decrease at the four stations in this table, are proba
bly attributable in far greater proportion to incidental errors in
the observations, than to the actual existence of such differences.
We may consequently regard the final column, or the mean of
the results at the four stations, as affording, in all probability,
a more satisfactory conclusion in regard to the rate of change at
any one of the stations than is drawn from the observations at
that station only.
We may proceed to examine how far this rate of decrease cor
responds with                    observations made in Britain.   In
August 1821,   the most recent   of more than usually careful
                                                                ob
               I made a series
servations on the amount of the dip in the Regent's Park in
London ; employing for that purpose a needle on Mayer's
principle, with weights of different magnitudes to obviate the
liability to any constant instrumental error, and continuing the
observations during several days in order that the general re
sult might approximate the more nearly to the true mean dip
at the period. These observations were published in the Phil.

Trans, for 1822, Art. I. ; their final result being a dip of 70°
02/,9, corresponding to the middle of the month of August
1821. To compare with this, we have the observations made
in London, at different    times and in
the contributors to this                  different localities, by
                           report. It is  proper that we should
employ for the present purpose only those observations which
give entirely independent determinations ; viz. those only which
are complete in all the requisite positions of the needle and
circle, including the reversal of the poles, and which need no
correction for instrumental defects. Of such observations we
III.have those at Westbourne Green, already given in Table

   We have therefore 70° 02'- 9 in August 1821, and 69° 17'3 in
May 1838; or a diminution of 45'-fi in 16'7 years, equivalent
to a mean annual decrease of 2'*73, corresponding to the middle
of the interval, or to the beginning of the year 1830. The

   * This is the mean of fourteen results, extremely accordant with each other,
obtained in different azimuths; (see Table V.). It will be remarked that it is
decidedly the highest of the results from which the mean dip in London has
been derived. The observations with the same instrument at Kew, as well as
every comparison between this and other instruments, give reason to believe
that the high dip in the Regent's Park, in November 1837, is not attributable
to any instrumental error. It may then have arisen either from the dip on
those days being actually greater hy three or four minutes thau its general
average, or from some local disturbing influence. The locality is the same in
which the observations in 1821 were made, and the result in question may
on that account appear more strictly comparable with them; but though
the locality is the same, it is not one in which we can feel confident that no
change may have occurred in regard to magnetic influence. The Regent's Park
is certainly not so eligible a situation now for magnetic experiments as it was
in 1821. These considerations have induced me to derive the London Dip in
 1838 for the purpose in the text, from the mean of the observations and local
ities in Table X, rather than from those in the Regent's Park alone ; and not
 to give to the latter result that additional weight in comparison with the
others to which it would seem entitled as derived from observations in so many
azimuths.

mean rate for the same year in M. Hansteen's table is 2'-93,
which must be regarded as a satisfactory accordance, the dif
ference being less than exists between the rate for that year at

any one of the stations in M. Hansteen's table, and the mean
of the four stations. We may infer from the accordance, there
fore,  that both                numbers, 2'-93
near   the truth   ;  these  I   have employed  and 2/-73, are extremely
                       and                       that which results from

our own observations, namely, 2'"73 corresponding to 1830.

Following the progression in M. Hansteen's table, the rate of
decrease would become 2''4 in 1836, which is the middle pe
riod of the observations contained in this report. In the re
ductions to a common epoch, 2'*4 has consequently been em
ployed as the mean annual decrease of the dip in the British
Islands between 1834 and 1838. In the absence of any certain

as taking place in the uniform proportion of (?-2 per month.

   In a recent communication to the Royal Irish Academy, Mr.
Lloyd has stated the result of thirty-nine observations of the dip
in Dublin between October 1833 and August 1836, which, com
bined by the method of least squares, give 2'-38 for the most
probable rate of the annual diminution of the dip in Dublin
during that period. This result, though drawn from so limited
a period, is in remarkable accordance with the deduction from
the observations in London, and furnishes a strong presumption
that the rate thus found is applicable both to England and Ire
land. In regard to Scotland, no observations have as yet been
made, I believe, with this particular object. The general
aspect of the observations in Scotland, at different dates, con
tained in this report, would certainly indicate a less annual
change than has been deduced from the observations in England
and Ireland ; and in every instance in Scotland where obser
vations have been made at the same station and at different

periods,   either  by the    --satmhee  or different observers, the evidence
is of the  same    nature,              results would be brought into better
accord if a smaller rate of decrease were adopted. In the case
of the Shetland Islands, the dip observed by Captain Ross at
Lerwick in August 1838, 73° 45', compared with that observed
by Sir Edward Parry and myself in June and November 1818,
74° 22', makes a decrease of 37' in twenty years, or a yearly
diminution of 1''85, corresponding to the mean epoch of 1828.

the inference, that the rate of annual decrease is less in Scot

Iland than in England. Still, in the absence of more positive

data, have not chosen to make any assumption ; and have
employed the one rate for the whole of the British Islands.
The general result in Scotland, i. e. the mass of observations
taken collectively, is independent of the amount of this re
duction, the sum of the + and -- reductions to the mean epoch
of the 1st of January, 1837, being very nearly the same : the
effect of a less rate of diminution than that adopted would be
to increase the dips deduced from the observations in 1836, and
to decrease those deduced from the observations in 1837 and
1838 ; and thus to give a rather more consistent aspect to the
whole, without sensibly altering the resulting isoclinal lines.
No correction has been applied for the different hours of the
day at which the several observations were made ; but the hour
is in almost all instances recorded. Professor Phillips had
devoted several days of observation to the investigation of the
regular horary variations of the dip, and had obtained results
remarkably consistent, considering that they were derived from
observations with the ordinary dipping needle*; but the recent
invention of instruments specially adapted to this object, renders
it probable that the phenomena of the periodical changes will be
shortly determined with an accuracy hitherto unattainable : in
the mean time, it has                               to apply no  correc
tion on this account.  Iatppmeaayredbe  preferable  remind the   reader,
                                         proper to
that the most perfect correction in this respect would still leave
unremedied the influence of the irregular fluctuations, which
there is great reason to believe frequently exceed in amount, and
occasionally counteract the ordinary periodical movements.

  I proceed now to give in detail the observations which com

prise the first division of this report ; namely, those of the Dip

in England, Scotland, and Ireland. It will be convenient to

separate these into three sections, commencing with those of
England ; and it may here be remarked generally, that all the
latitudes and longitudes in this Report are taken from the maps
published by the Society for Diffusing Useful Knowledge. The
longitudes east of Greenwich are distinguished by the negative
sign prefixed.

   · Mr. Phillips's observations at St Clairs and York, in the summer of 1837,
from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., appear to indicate a morning maximum of dip at 9 or
10 a.m., an evening minimum about 8, with a difference of above 5 minutes,

the mean dip recurring about 3 p.m., and the line passing through the three

points nearly parabolic.

  Table XII. contains the latitudes and longitudes of Mr.

Lloyd's stations, and the mean dip at each station : the number
of distinct comparisons are, at London 2, Shrewsbury 2,
Ryde 2 ; at each of the other places, 1 : in the subsequent
calculation, these numbers are taken as the weights.

stations markeda     the reversal of the poles was intentionally

                 f,
omitted, from desire to determine small local differences, under

circumstances as similar as possible, the needles being very
nearly equilibrated. The table shows which of the observations
were thus incomplete and the comparison of the results at the
                         ;

other stations, before and after the reversal of the poles, shows
the probable small limit of error which may have been involved
by the omission. With the poles direct, and also with the poles
reversed, the mean of four positions was taken, being eight in all

the needle was always inverted on its supports, as well as the
circle turned in azimuth four readings of each end of the

needle were generally taken in each position.

ving axles, and were found on trial to give accordant dips in
different positions of the axle : each observation with them re
corded in the following tables is a mean of the usual eight
positions. For these needles, consequently, no corrections
are applied, and it will be seen by the observations at West-

bourne Green in June, July, and December, 1838, that all

these needles gave very nearly the same dip when used under
like circumstances of time and place. Their mean result at
Westbourne Green has been employed by Captain Ross as a
standard to furnish corrections for the other needles which he

                                    on      which     RheL3co,uladndnoRt           with

used for the intensity as well as for the dip, and their poles,
therefore, were not reversed. They were always used in pairs,
Land the correction determined for the mean result of R
L LR L 2 was + 3, and that for R 3 and R 4, + 1 6.                        1 and

           The remaining five needles were observed in the usual eight
positions, but in consequence of imperfect workmanship re
quired corrections, which, by comparison with the standard
needles, were assigned as follows :

are applied in a column in the table headed corrected dip."

method of least squares, we obtain the following values :

#= + ·1974; y=--5114; m = -68°54'; r=0'-548; and
S=69° 53'-4 at the mean geographical position of 52° 16' N.,

reversed, and the observation was consequently complete. At

the other four stations Gambey's circle was not employed, and
we have to deduce from the observations with S 2 the dips that
would have been shown by a needle with the poles reversed. In

the report of the Magnetic Observations in Scotland, (B. A. re

ports, vol. vi. page 98,) a correction for this purpose wa3 de
rived from a comparison of results obtained at Limerick with
S 2, and with a needle on Mayer's principle, used in a circle
of Nairne and Blunt's ; and we have here observations at eight
other stations, furnishing materials for a similar comparison
between the results of S 2, and of Gambey's instrument.

    * The observations at Limerick with S 2 and Mayer's needle have been already
detailed in the Cth Report of the British Association, page 98. As the comparison
of their results is slightly affected by employing a different rate of annual decrease
for the purpose of reducing the observations to a common epoch, they are stated
afresh.

   Major Sabine's Observations. --These observations were
made at twenty-seven stations in the summer of 1836, with a
circle by Nairne and Blunt, and the needle S 2 of Robinson.

The details have been already published in the 5th vol. of the
Reports of the British Association, and need not therefore be
repeated in this place. When that Report was published, the
correction of S 2 was provisionally taken as --12'; it has since
been more correctly ascertained to be -- 9''5 by a much more

extensive series of comparative observations ; (Table XIX.) The
subjoined table (XXIV.) contains the latitudes and longitudes of

the twenty- seven stations, and the dips, to which the new correc
tion of -- 9''5 has been applied. As the whole of these obser
vations were comprised within an interval of six weeks, no
reduction to a mean epoch has been thought necessary.

The portion of country over which these observations extend
is too limited to afford an advantageous combination for the
deduction of the values of u and r ;  I have
                                               therefore  coXmXbiInVed.,
them with my own twenty-seven         results  in Table

forming an united series of thirty-six stations towards the final
deduction of the values of u and r in Scotland, Mr. Fox's ob

servations having been previously reduced to September 1836.
From this combination we obtain the following values; x =
+ ·320; y=»--447; K=-54°20'; r = 0-550;
                                                45° =l7C2°W1.3-2  at
the mean geographical position 56° 18' N., and

  If we collect in one view the values of u and r which have

been thus obtained from the observations in Scotland, we have
as follows :

servation, therefore, gave the values of z and zQ, and the equa
tions of condition thus obtained were combined, by the method
of least squares, so as to give the most probable values of M
and N. In a subsequent application of this method, (Sixth
Report, p. 99) Major Sabine adopted a better course, and
took an arbitrary station, with an unknown dip and intensity,
as the origin. z0 was thus unknown, as well as M and N ; and
the resulting equations gave not only the most probable values
of the increase of the dip (or intensity) in the two directions,
but likewise that of its absolute amount at some one station.

  LLet this latter quantity be denoted by L, i. e. let z0 = in

the preceding equation ; then each observation will furnish an
equation of condition of the form
                                 L + Mx + Ny = z.
                                                                                                                                   (2)

Combining these equations by the method of least squares, we
have the three following final equations :

for in such cases the curvature of the lines not being rapid, the
curve itself may, for a small portion of its extent, be confound
ed with its tangent. It suggests perhaps the best mode of de
termining with precision the empirical laws of the distribution
of terrestrial magnetism ; namely, by means of small groups of
observations, each of which will give, by this method, not a point
in the curve merely, but a portion of its tangent.

   The extent of the district in which this method is available
will, of course, vary with the curvature of the lines on the

earth's surface, becoming more and more limited as we approach
the poles. Where the flexure of the lines is rapid, and we
seek, nevertheless, to combine the observations scattered over
a moderately extensive tract of country, it becomes necessary
to obtain some means of pushing the approximation further.

    Such means readily present themselves. Whatever be the
laws of distribution of magnetism on the surface of the earth,
it is manifest that the dip (or intensity) at any station is a func
tion of its co-ordinates of position ; or that

Here, then,   the isoclinal line                   is of the second order ; and    its
species is determined by the relation of the first three coeffi
cients, P, Q, R. The equation of the curve being found, it is
easy to construct it graphically by points.
   The preceding solution of the problem is probably suffi

cient for all purposes ; but the determination of six unknown
quantities by the method of least squares, when the equations
of condition are numerous, is a formidable labour ; and it is
therefore important to consider whether we can safely stop
short at any step of less generality. Now it is easily seen that
in most cases to which we have to apply this method, the iso

clinal line may be represented by the equation

                     P a? + N y + M x = K,                                        (9)

in which there are only four coefficients to be determined*.
This equation (considered as belonging to a plane curve) is that
of a parabola.

   The equation, being linear in one of the coordinates, is very
easily constructed by points.

* This is evident from geometrical considerations.
   Let L M be a portion of the curve, re

and let L Q be its tangent at the point L

curve P M, is equal  toPQ + QM. But
P Q, the ordinate of the tangent, is equal to

   The object proposed in the preceding method has been at
tained by Major Sabine by a different process, which will be
applied by him in the sequel. It is therefore unnecessary to
make any application of that here laid down.

    In combining the equations of condition by the method of
least squares, it is manifest that we cannot, in general, allow
equal weight to all. The result obtained at one station may be
derived from a single observation only ; while, at another, it
may be the mean of several observations, made at different
times, and with different instruments. In a former discussion
of the observations in Ireland, weights were assigned to the

E^=^E* + y9E*.                                                      (14)

The case of a linear function includes every case in which
the quantities sought are already approximately known. We
have only to substitute for these quantities their approximate
values plus the unknown corrections, and to neglect the squares
and higher powers of the latter.
   To apply these principles to an  important  case, --let  it  be  re

quired to determine the probable error (or the weight) of the

mean dip at a given station, as deduced from no observations,
with n. instruments.

   The true dip being equal to the observed dip plus the in
strumental correction, it is manifest that, in this case,

                              E2 = E* +E2.;

Substituting these numbers in (12), the prohable error of ob
servation in the former series is found to be 2'-l ; and in the

latter 3'-0.
  It is remarkable that the squares of these errors (the inverse

of which are the measures of the weights) are, almost exactly,
in the ratio of 1 to 2 ; that is, in the inverse ratio of the num
ber of readings with each needle. This is a curious confirma
tion of the accuracy of the conclusion.
From the preceding it follows, that in combining the results
of the two needles, L. 1 and L. 4, (when

that the probable error of the mean, thus deduced, is l'-8. We
may therefore consider two minutes as the probable error of
observation in the present series, whether the result be that
of a single needle with the usual number of readings, or the

mean of the two needles L. 1 and L. 4.
   The probable instrumental error, eit varies, of course, within
very wide limits, depending on the perfection of workmanship.

    this dip and that due to the geographical position of the sta

       The mean local error will, of course, be very different in dif
    ferent countries, the differences depending chiefly on the re
    lative proportion of the igneous and sedimentary rocks. In
    Scotland, as appears from Major Sabine's excellent report (Sixth
    Report, p. 102), the local error considerable in England

       probably small. We may estimate its amount in any district,
    by computing the dip due to the geographical position of each
    station, by the formula (2), and taking the sum of the squares

We have now to consider the actual errors of the instru
ments employed in the preceding observations.
The errors of dipping needles may be ascribed to one or
other of the three following causes namely,                                        the friction of
                                           ;

It

                  3,
   owing to the first-mentioned cause that a dipping nee
dle assumes, in general, a new position of equilibrium after
has been disturbed, the limit of error being the angle at which
the directive force, increasing as the sine of the deviation,
becomes equal to the friction. This limit varies, for given

turbing cause is merely to widen the limits of probable error.
The imperfect curvature of the axle, and the magnetism of the
limb, act however very differently. Either of these sources of
error must, at a given place, affect all the results in the same
manner; and, consequently, no repetition of observation, with
an instrument so circumstanced, can afford even an approxi

mation to the true dip. At different places the error will be
different, and will vary according to no assignable law.
  The course to be pursued by the observer with reference
to these errors is manifest. Their existence or non-existence
should be ascertained at the outset by one or other of the means
pointed out by Major Sabine in the commencement of this me

moir ; and if found to surpass certain limits, the instrument

should be rejected. The case is different, however, when the
instrument has been actually employed
                                                  for  some time pre
viously to the detection of the error.          Here
                                                       we must seek, if
possible, to determine the probable amount of the error, and

Where the district of observation limited, this practicable.

It will be easily understood, that the imperfect curvature of the
axle, or the disturbing action of the limb, must, within a moderate
range of dip, affect all the results in the same manner, so that
they will all require correction having the same sign and that
when the range of dip very small, the amount of the dis

ation of this quantity may be disregarded.
The importance of an exact determination of these needle-
corrections is very great in the present instance. When, in
deed, the same needle is employed throughout an entire series

of observations (as was done by Major Sabine in Scotland), it
is manifest that any error in the amount of its correction will
have the effect only of displacing the isoclinal lines in absolute
position, leaving their direction and interval unaltered. For
the direction and interval of the lines depend solely on the dif
ferences of dip ; and these are manifestly independent of the
correction, which alters all the dips by the same amount. The
case is different, however, when (as in the present instance)
           needles requiring correction  are employed in the same

difference will displace one entire group of results relatively to
the rest, and thus (when the mean geographical position of

Before we proceed to determine the amount of these errors
in the needles employed in the Irish survey, it may be desirable
to make a few remarks on their particular causes.
Of the two sources of error above mentioned, the imperfec
tion of axle appears to be the most common ; and it is to it we

Iproceeded to use them exclusively for observations of intensity.

The results thus obtained were, however, so anomalous, that
Iwas compelled to reject them altogether. After some tedious

and vain attempts to discover the source of the anomaly, was
at length satisfied, by a careful inspection of the results, that the
needles were under the influence of some other force besides

the earth's magnetism and gravity, and I concluded that this
disturbing force could be no other than magnetism in the dip

circle itself. Trial soon verified this conjecture, and I had the

fmortification to find that the apparatus which I had been so

long using was throughout magnetic, and that the magnetism

merous results obtained with this instrument were vitiated by
this newly-discovered source of error     ? Whether they were
entitled to any confidence ; and if so,   what were the probable
limits of error ? It is manifest that if  the ferruginous matter
were uniformly distributed throughout the limb, it could pro
duce no   disturbance in   the   position of a needle which

an irregularity in its distribution that the magnetic matter of
the limb can operate as a disturbing cause ; and then it is ma
nifestly only by the difference of the attractions, on the two
sides of each pole, that the needle is actually disturbed. Hence,
though the magnetism of the limb may produce very decided
effects upon a test needle, in a position at right angles to its

plane, the effect upon a dipping needle may be comparatively
trifling.

zontal support of wood. Three strong pins in contact with the
inner edge of the limb, and dividing it equally, were then driven
into the  support, so as to prevent the limb from
motion,   except one of rotation in its own plane.   Ahamvinaggneantiyc

was then supported delicately within       it,

the bar from its undisturbed position was observed in the
different positions of the limb with respect to it.
                                                              was thus
found that most parts of the limb exerted a sensible disturbing
effect upon the needle and that this effect was not only con
siderable in the neighbourhood of the two zero points of the limb
(the part where the    ;anomalies had been first observed), but that
    also varied there                      detailed examination of

the effects in this position showed that there was disturbinga
centre of ferruginous matter in the neighbourhood of each of
these points, and that was to the action of these centres
that the anomalies in the observations above alluded to were

owing.

   In the neighbourhood of the divisions of 70° the disturbance
of the needle was likewise considerable, and its direction was
such as to diminish the apparent dip. Here, then, we have the
cause of the large negative error of the results obtained with
this instrument. But this deflection did not vary rapidly on
either side of these positions, so that for small changes of dip

therefore, as the apparatus is in this respect, there is reason to
conclude that                        wdiitfhfeinrenthceesuosufadlilpimoitbstaoinfepdrowbiathbleit                 in Ireland

          comparison of the results with those of other instruments seems to point
to the conclusion that this error diminishes with the dip, and somewhat less
in England than in Ireland.

    In L. and L. needles whose poles are unchanged, the
errors here deduced are, of course, those which result from
the moment of the needles' weight, combined with that arising
from the disturbing action of the limb.
    The weights due to these corrections are at once deduced
from the principles of the preceding pages. When the results
of one needle, at given station, are compared with those of
                            a

count the probable instrumental error of the results with
which it has been compared ; and we have (15)

   To apply this, we shall assume, as before, the instrumental
error to be equal to the error of observation, the latter inclu
ding the error of epoch ; and we obtain

We shall adopt the nearest whole numbers, G, 4, 7.
   The correction of needle S. 2 has been determined with

great care by Major Sabine *, by a comparison, at various sta
tions, of its results with those of the needles M and G. 2,
needles which may be regarded as almost free from all instru
mental error. The amount of this correction is -- 9'"6 ; and
its weight 16. This amount is almost identical with that pre
viously employed in the calculation of the Irish observations.

   The other needle employed by Major Sabine in Ireland, S. 1,
is constructed on a plan suggested by Mr. Dollond. The
middle of the needle has the form of a cube, and is perforated
so as to receive the axle in different directions, the intention
being, that the position of the axle should be varied in the

          * Table XIX.

course of every observation. From some defect of workman
ship, however, the balance of the needle was much deranged
in some positions of the axle ; and it was accordingly employed
by Major Sabine as an ordinary dipping needle, the axle being
permanently fixed in one position in which the needle was to
lerably balanced. This was the case during the observations
made with it in August, September, and October, 1834 (Fifth
Rofeptohert,sepr.ies1.39)  ; the axle being undisturbed during the  whole
                           In 1835, when Captain Ross used this     needle

at Westbourne Green, the axle had been repolished, and was,
moreover, fixed by the artist in a different position from that
which it had occupied during the observations of the preceding
year. So far, therefore, as axle error is concerned, the needle
must, then and thenceforward, be regarded as a different nee
dle.
In order to deduce the amount of the axle error, previously
to the alteration just alluded to, we may compare the result
obtained with this needle at Limerick, in August 1834, with
the mean dip of the place as given by other needles. The dif
ference (4,,2) is probably not greater than the probable error

of observation, which, owing to the imperfect polish of the
axle, was in this needle considerable. Under these circum

stances, we are not justified in assigning to it any correction.

   The needles employed by Mr. Fox appear to give results
extremely consistent with one another, and with those of other
needles. In their case, therefore, no correction is required.

   We are now prepared to exhibit in one view the mean*
values of the dip, as deduced from these various needles. The
following table contains the results of observations arranged
chronologically, and corrected as has been above explained.

   * Where the needles L. 1 and L. 4 have been employed together, double
weight has been allowed to the results of the former in taking the mean, in
accordance with the conclusion of page 98.

Of the foregoing results, those obtained at the Giants' Cause
way and at Colerain are manifestly affected, to a very consider
able extent, by the disturbing action of the basaltic rocks. The
effect of the basaltic pillars of the Causeway upon the magnetic
needle has been long since observed ; and on comparing the dip
recorded in the preceding table, with that due to the geogra
phical position of the station, we find it in excess to the amount

of 50\ At Colerain, on the other hand, the effect of the
disturbing action has been to diminish the dip, but in a less
amount. The cause of these irregularities being apparent, we
have no hesitation in rejecting the results, in the computation
of the the isoclinal lines.

Before we proceed to this computation, we must estimate the
weights of the observed results ; and for this purpose it is ne
cessary to know the amount of the probable error of station.
This    is obtained
                       by     computing (with     assumed approximate
values   of L,M,N,)    the    probable dip at    each station, due to its

geographical position, and comparing it with that observed.
The sum of the squares of the differences of the computed and
observed  results, substituted      (itnhe(1e2rr)o, rws ilol fgiovbesetrhveatitoontalanmdeaonf
probable  error ; from which

instrument being already known) the local error is deduced
by means of the equation (17).

   Now assuming the approximate values

           L = 71° 22' -5, M = +-30, N = +-51 ;

the probable dip at each station will be given by the formula

                  z = 7\°22'-5+-30x +-51 y;

and the computation gives for the sum of the squares of the
differences of the computed and observed results, at the 32
stations,

                       2 {x-a)*= 1192-09;

from which we find (12)

E denoting the total probable error at any one station. But if

Eo and E< denote the mean probable errors of observation and
of instrument at each station, and E; the probable local error,

                    E4 = E£ + E* + Ef.

To deduce the weight of the result of n observations, with nf

instruments, at any station, we substitute the values thus ob
tained in (17), and we obtain

                    1-4(1             + 0.

When the local error, therefore, bears so great proportion to
the errors of observation and of instrument, as does in the pre
sent instance,      manifestly waste of labour (as far as regards
                    of       position of the

The foregoing observations having been made with different
needles in the same circle, it becomes necessary, in estimating
the probable error, to separate those due to the limb from those
which    athraiesseionbfgrsoleemrvoaibrtrsioeengrvsualawtireoitrnieeswtaitkihnent,eha--echanxanlmee.eedlyleF,(ri--onmathllethbeauxtmleoondeeerrinoinr

and the error of observation are combined ; and the beautiful
accordance of the partial observations shows that their com
bined result is inconsiderable. There seems reason, however,
for believing that the circle itself is not free from error. The
mean result obtained with these needles, in this circle, at West-
bourne Green, is 2',0 less than the mean of the other needles
employed at the same place (see Table III.) ; while on the other
hand, they give a result  3'*8 in excess                                     of the   mean dip, as shown
by Gambey's needles in    Dublin, -- the                                      latter  being observed by
the method of arbitrary azimuths.
Now the total probable error at each station, in this series,
(rtahesasutdlteosdf)utchiseedfofofurronmmderatosceobrimeesp.4a/,r0is,Oo--nf  of the computed and observed
                                                                             a result scarcely differing from
                                                                             this, the part which is reduced
by repetition is (as has been already stated) exceedingly small ;
and, consequently, the remainder (the combined result of the
station and circle errors) is considerable. Under these cir
cumstances, it will be readily seen, no disproportion in the
number of observations can materially alter the weights ; and
as, in addition to this, the observations have been distributed
with some attention to uniformity, it is manifest that we must
regard the weights of all the stations as equal.
   The results of calculation are

         L  =  71"  2u2='-(),-6M3°=49+',                                     -270, N =   +  -550

Hence the dip at the central station, on the 1st November,
1838, was 71° 22'*0, the central station being the same as
before ; consequently, the probable dip at that station, on the
1st January, 1837, was 71° 26'-4.

  Finally, if we combine these results with those of the former

series, allowing weights in proportion to the number of stations,
we find

         L = 71° 23'-7, M = + -292, N =                                                  +  -517

                    u= -60° 32', r =-594;

120 EIGHTH REPORT 1838.

  Collecting in one view the values of u and r at the central

geographical positions in England, Scotland and Ireland, as
they have been derived from the several series in each country,
we have as follows :

England,   Lat.52°38'.          Lo--ng.   2°  07';  m=-65°05' ;         r=0'575'
Scotland,  --                     --      3°  39';  m=-56°06';          r=0-549'
           --     56° 49'.                8°  00';  m=-60°32';          r=0-594'
Ireland,          53° 21'.

    Whence it appears that the isoclinal lines do not intersect the
geographical meridian at the same angle in the three countries ;
that they form a greater angle with the meridians in England
than in either of the other two countries ; and that the angle
                                          than in   Scotland.

in Scotland, less in England, and least in Ireland ; the number
of geographical miles, measured on the perpendicular, corres
ponding to differences of a degree of dip,-- being

                                109-2 in Scotland;
                                104-4 in England;
                                101-0 in Ireland.

    It follows, from the different values of r, that the assumption,
upon which we have hitherto proceeded in these combinations,
of parallelism of the lines and their equidistance apart, does not
hold good when applied to an area of the extent of the British
islands, and not strictly so for any of its three portions ; and
that it is desirable to find a method of more exactly represent
ing the observations, by tracing each isoclinal line separately
Iffrom observations nearly of its own value, and consequently but
little removed from it in geographical distance.                            we have
the approximate values of u and r at any station where the dip
has been observed, we may readily compute the latitude and
Iflongitude of a point furnished by that observation for the po
sition of the next adjacent isoclinal line.                  the isoclinal lines

                  If the observation                         or falls short of
69° 00* by a few minutes, the point furnished by it for the
isoclinal line must be distant from the station a geographical
space, equivalent to the value in distance of the fractional mi
nutes, as computed by the value of r, and in the direction of

is X, then is (D -- 8) r the difference of latitude, and (D -- 8)
cos u sec X the difference of longitude, between the station and

the point which it furnishes for the isoclinal line.

   We have the values of u and r at the central geographical po

sitions in England, Ireland, and Scotland, as derived from obser

vation. If, for a general central station in the British Islands,

we take the mean of the central stations in the three countries,

viz. lat. 54° 16' N., long. 4° 35' W., we may deduce the values
of m and r for that station from equations of the form

             Uj  =  u  +  a,x  +  b,y
             r,  =     +  a,x  +  b,y,
                    r

where u, is the angle and r, the rate of increase at one of the
three central geographical positions ; at and b, co-ordinates of
distance in longitude and latitude from the general central sta

tion, expressed in geographical miles ; and x and y coefficients
of the chauge in the values of u and r in each geographical mile,
y in the direction of the meridian, and x in that of the perpen
dicular thereto. The mean results in the three countries will

then furnish respectively the three following equations for the
value of u ;

                   England, 3905' = u -- 89 x -- 98 y j

              y;Scotland, 3366' = w -- 34 .r + 153y ;

   In combining these equations therefore by the method of
least squares, to obtain the most probable values of u, x, and y,
we may give the weight of 3 to the English result, and that of

unity to each of the two others.
   Pursuing the usual process, we derive u = -- 60° 42' ; x =

+ 0*6 ; y = +2-0 : and we may compute the approximate value
of m at any geographical position in the British Islands, by the

formula

             u = -- 60° 42' + 0-6 a + 2 b,
122 EIGHTH REPORT -- 1838.

the origin of the coordinates, a and b being the general central
station in 4° 35' W. longitude, and 54° 16' N. latitude.

   Proceeding in the same manner for r, we have the 3 equations :
               England, + 0*575 = r -- 89 .v -- 98 y ;
               Scotland, + 0-549 = r -- 34 x + 153 y ;
               Ireland, + 0-594 = r + 123 x -- 55 y.

   Giving the English result the weight of 3, and each of the
others that of unity, and deducing by the method of least squares
the most probable values of r, x, and y, we obtain x = + '00007 ;
y = -- -00013 ; and r = 0-571, at the central general station
in lat. 54° 16' and long. 4° 35' W.

   Whence the approximate value of r is found at any other geo
graphical position in the British Islands by the formula

                r = + 0-571 +-00007 a -- -00013 b ;

the longitude and latitude of the general central station being the
origin of the coordinates a and b.
The points furnished by the several observations for the near
est adjacent isoclinal line, computed in the manner above de
scribed, are inserted in the general table which closes this divi
sion of the report. The table is in two parts ; the one con

taining the observations, the other the deductions. In the first
part are shown the observed dip, the latitude and longitude of the
station, the date, the observer, and a reference to the particular
table in which all the details connected with the observations

may be examined. In the division which contains the deduc
tions, are shown the dip reduced to the mean epoch of the 1st
January, 1837 ; the differences of latitude and longitude between
the station and the point furnished by it for the nearest isoclinal
line ; the latitude and longitude of the points, and the values of
u and r, employed in their deduction.
By the method thus described, the transfer of the observation
to the isoclinal line involves no other material inaccuracy than
such as may be occasioned by incorrectness in the employed
values of u   and r. We may,
limit of the   inaccuracy which  therefore,                     examine the    --pr3o0bamblie

which a deduction is required : if we suppose an error in the

                                                             the geographical  distance of
the point from the station will be less than one mile. An error
of 1° in the value of u, in the same extreme case of a fractional

amount of 30' of dip, would cause an error in the position as

signed to the point of less than one mile in latitude, and half a
mile in longitude. We may hence estimate the probable limits

of inaccuracy in the extreme cases alluded to. It is obvious that
when the fractional minutes in the observation are less than
thirty, these limits are proportionally reduced ; and it is further
plain that errors thus occasioned will be of a contrary nature to
each other, according as the fractional minutes are in excess or
in defect of the degree which the line represents. When, there
fore, the observations are numerous, and fall on both sides of

the lines, as is the case in this survey, a mutual compensation is
afforded, and whatever small inaccuracies there may be in the
values of u and r, their ultimate effect on the lines may be re
Ifgarded as wholly insensible.
        the observations  aitnfeluaecnhces,ta--tioannd  were free from instru
mental defect and local
                                                        if they were continued
sufficiently long at each station to furnish its mean dip inde
pendent of diurnal and irregular fluctuations, -- the points com
puted from them and transferred to a map would require merely
to be connected in order to form the isoclinal line. As might
be expected, however, the results of the observations are far
from presenting this perfect accordance, especially in Scotland,
where the prevalence of igneous rocks produces much disturb
ing action. An examination of the map, however, in which the
points, and the stations they are derived from, are inserted, will
show that, notwithstanding the disturbing causes referred to,
they do arrange themselves in such manner as to leave very
little uncertainty in any quarter in tracing the position and
direction of each isoclinal line. Each line thus becomes an

independent determination, derived from observations which be
long to itself alone, and uninfluenced by those which differ more
than thirty minutes from the degree which the line represents *.
   By this method of combination, any departure from system
atic arrangement which might exist in any one of the lines
passing across the British Islands, would become manifest at
once to the eye. Individual stations there are, particularly in
Scotland and the north of Ireland, which throw their points to

some distance from their respective lines. In some very few
cases, a group of neighbouring stations appears to be similarly
affected. The most prominent instance of this is in North Wales,
where there appears a decided disposition of the majority of the

   · This has been strictly adhered to in the table everywhere ; and in the map
everywhere over the surface of the land. The lines are extended in the map a
short distance beyond the land; and as the observations which justify this ex
tension are few in comparison with those in other parts of the map, the determi
nations which fall nearly midway between two lines have, in these few cases,
been given a bearing on the lines on cither side of them.

points to fall to the south of the line of 71°, contrasted with and
counterbalanced by an opposite tendency of the points furnished
for the same line on the east of Ireland*. A more extensive

research is necessary to determine whether, by multiplying the
number of stations in these localities, this apparent irregularity
would disappear, or whether the observations referred to truly
represent what may be termed a district anomaly. Whilst,
however, on minute examination the eye may rest on single
stations, or on groups, which present examples of the slight
irregularities here referred to, it cannot fail, on the general
aspect of the map, to be struck by the absence of any important
unsymmetrical inflections, and by the obvious general systematic
arrangement of the terrestrial magnetism indicated by the lines.
Here, as elsewhere, they present the features of the general
magnetic system ; the effects of local and partial disturbance
being indeed discernible on close examination, but not being
found of sufficient comparative magnitude to influence the

general representation.
IfThe lines of dip as they appear on the map are slightly
curved, being convex towards the S.E.  the extreme points
of each line were connected by an arc of a great circle, the cur
vature of the arc, on the projection which is here employed,
would be in the opposite direction to that of the isoclinal lines,

or the convexity would be towards the N.W. Their departure
from such a straight line on the surface of the globe (or their
difference from great circles) is greater therefore than appears
in this projection.

   * This apparent dislocation of the line of 71° between England and Ireland
was noticed by Mr. Fox in the Report of the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic So
ciety for 1835. No trace of a corresponding irregularity occurs in the conti
nuity of the line 72° in crossing the Irish Channel.

                DIVISION II.-- INTENSITY.

   The observations of the Intensity are arranged in three
sections, in the same manner as those of the Dip.

                                                        Section I. --England.

                                                                § 1. Statical Method.
Mr. Lloyd's Observations. These were made with the needles
XLIIL. 3, L. 4, (page 82), in a 4£ inch circle, made by Robinson.
Table              contains the detailed statement of the obser

vations.                                                        Table XLII.

   [0 is the angle which the needle makes with the horizon, the
southern arm being loaded with a weight. The negation sign
indicates that the north pole of the needle is above the hori
zontal line.

                        loss of  force in the interval of time which           elapsed
between the two observations at Shrewsbury. Now the obser
vations at Dublin in April and May prove that the loss sus
tained by the needle during the series of observations in spring
was comparatively trifling ; while, from the results obtained at
the same place in May and August, it appears that the mag
netism of the needle remained perfectly steady in the interval
between the two series. We are consequently conducted to
the conclusion, that the change occurred in the short interval

between the observations at Dublin on the 5th of August and
those at Shrewsbury on the 9th ; and we have every reason to
believe that it was previous to the observation at Birkenhead,
and probably due to some accident in the passage across the
channel. The magnetism of the needle appears to have been
steady during the remainder of the autumn series. This, we
think, will appear from the difference of the angles at Shrews-

bury and London (near the commencement and end of the se
ries, respectively), as compared with the difference observed at
the same places in spring.

   With respect to Needle L. 4, the observations at Dublin in
April and May show that its magnetism was perfectly steady
during the spring series. This needle, however, sustained a
very great loss of force between the two sets of observations
with it at Ryde ; and this loss appears to have been, in a great
measure, a sudden one. But that the magnetism of the needle
was not stationary during the remainder of the autumn series,
will appear at once from a comparison of the observations at
Shrewsbury in April and August. As we have no satisfactory
means of determining the amount of this loss, and of interpo

lating a correction, we are forced to reject all the results ob
tained with this needle in autumn.

   Professor Phillips's observations.--These were made with
a needle on Mr. Lloyd's statical principle, employed in Mr.
Phillips's six-inch circle. The needle had been recently re
ceived from the maker (Robinson), when it was first used at
York in June 1837 ; and the results obtained with it on the
3rd and 5th June, compared with those on the 15th June, indi
cated that its magnetism had not become steady. To obviate
this inconvenience as far as might be possible, Mr. Phillips re
peatedly, during the series of his determinations, brought the
needle back to York, and re-examined its magnetic state.
We are thus furnished with observations at that station in
June,                                           OTcatbobleerX, L1V8I3.7,,

portion of magnetic force lost by the needle in the several in
tervals. It will be seen that the loss, on the daily average,
progressively diminished ; and, excepting in the first interval,
namely, between the 4th and 15th June, was not of sufficient
amount to create much uncertainty in the results, after the ap
plication of a correction assigned in the usual manner, viz. a
daily rate for each interval, obtained by dividing the whole loss
in an interval by the number of days which it contains. In re
gard to the first interval, when the loss was considerable, and
where a correction applied on the above principle can scarcely
be supposed an exact representation of the facts, it fortunately
happens that the six included stations are all in Yorkshire ;
and thus, though an equable correction in this interval may
make the values of the intensity at these stations appear more
discrepant with each other than they otherwise would do, yet
their collective bearing on the position and direction of the
isodynamic lines is scarcely affected.

         tain the relative values of the intensity, in the first column to

         York, and in the second to London. The frequent repetition
         of the observations at York, at different dates, renders that
         station the proper base of Mr. Phillips's series. The obser
         vations at York and London in February and March 1838,
         furnish a direct comparison of the force at those stations, and
         by means of that comparison, a determination of its value at all
         the other stations relatively to the London unity.

axle, which receives a thread of unspun silk, furnished with
hooks, to which weights may be attached. The weights em
ployed were successively 2-0 grains, 2- 1 grains, 2'2 grains ; and
with each weight the intensities are in the inverse ratio of the
angle of deflection produced, corrections being applied for
differences of temperature at the different stations. The fol
lowing table exhibits the angles of deflection occasioned by
the respective weights, and the values of the intensity deduced
therefrom. The angles are reduced to a common temperature ;
1° of the centigrade scale having been found by experiment to
be equivalent to 2', or 2'-4 in the angle.

148 EIGHTH REPORT -- 1838.

                  § 2. By the Method of Vibrations.

The observations by this method include twenty- seven sta
tions; i. e. 18 by Captain Ross; 7 by Major Sabine; and 2 by
Mr. Lloyd.
    1 st. Captain Ross's determinations were made with a cylin

der (X) vibrated in an apparatus on the well-known plan of M.

Hansteen. The loss of magnetism sustained by the cylinder
during the time of its employment, from July 1837 to June 1838,
was very considerable, and was occasionally so irregular as
to prevent any satisfactory conclusion whatsoever being drawn
from the observations. On a careful examination, there ap
peared two intervals, viz.         f--roamndthferommidAdplreilo2f4SetoptJeumnebe5r,  to the
m--idddulreinogf  November 1837,                                                      1838,
                  which there was  reason to infer that the loss of mag

netism, though considerable, had been tolerably uniform and
regular. During the second interval, viz. from April 24 to
June 5, 1838, on both which days the cylinder was vibrated in
London, the increase in the time of vibration at the same sta
tion affords a direct measure of the diminution in its magnetic
intensity ; and being divided by the number of days comprised
in the interval, furnishes the amount of the daily correction.
But in the first interval we have the additional disadvantages
of having no direct observation showing the amount of the loss
of magnetism, and no direct comparison with the force in
London : and it is necessary, consequently, to have recourse to
indirect means for the purpose of determining these particulars.
On the 19th of September,          1837, Captain Ross vibrated cylin
                                                oXfLSVepIIt.emwbeer,haavt eDothue

value of the intensity at both these stations relatively to the
London  unity, determined by Mr. Phillips ; and in Table
        we have Mr. Lloyd's determination of the force at
XLIV.
Birkenhead. We may employ these determinations to supply
the time of vibration in London corresponding to the observa
tions with the cylinder at Douglas and Birkenhead. In like
manner we may accomplish a second indirect comparison with
London by means of Captain Ross's observations at Falmouth
on the 18th of November, 1837, combined with the values of
                             that station determined by Mr.  Fox,

L         2.   Marn.dLloLyd(b's),  observations       were made with two cylinders,
          (a)                       vibrated in        Hansteen's apparatus. The
agreement of their times of vibration in Dublin, in April and
May 1836, is an evidence that their magnetic state remained
unaltered in the interval. The values of the intensity at
Shrewsbury and Holyhead are deduced, in relation to the Lon
don unity, by means of the force in Dublin ; which, in a sub
sequent part of this Report, will be shown to be 1-0195. The
coefficient in the formula of reduction to a mean temperature,
is -00025 for both cylinders. (5th Report, B. A., pp. 119 and

120.)

                 § 1. Observations by the Statical Method.

  Major Sabine's Observations. --These were made in the
summer of 1836, with the statical needle S (2); an account of
them is contained in the report on the Scotch Magnetical

Lines, in the 6th vol. of the Reports of the British Association.
Between the 30th of July and the 4th of October, in which in
terval the magnetism of the needle was shown to have sustained

no change, twenty-two stations were observed at, including two
in Ireland, viz. Bangor and Dublin. These are now transferred
to the Irish Series, and being thus included in their more appro

priate place, will be omitted here. At the time of the publica
tion of the Scotch report, no direct comparison had been made
of the intensity in Scotland with that in London ; but its values

at the several Scottish stations relatively to London were given
provisionally, by means of the observations in Dublin, and by
adopting 1 "0208 as the ratio of the force in Dublin to unity in
London, according to a determination of Mr. Lloyd's, published
in the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy, in 1836. The
values at the Scottish stations were consequently subject to
be altered by any modification which Mr. Lloyd's determina
tion in Dublin might subsequently receive. In the present
report Mr. Lloyd has given a corrected value for the force in
Dublin, resulting from a much larger number of determinations.

The corrected value is T0195. With this value, therefore,
and the comparative observations at Dublin and Helensburgh,
published in the Sixth Report of the British Association, we
may now derive a more correct expression, relatively to London
for the intensity at Helensburgh as the base of the Scottish
determinations.
The observations contained in the Scotch report presented
a double comparison between Dublin and Helensburgh : one
by the observations of the 22nd July, in Dublin, and the 27th
July, at Helensburgh ; the other by those of August 2, and
September 13 and 14, at Helensburgh, and October 4, at Dub

                 are presented  first  and second comparisons  the  needle
                 Between the
sustained an accident, which is related in the Scottish Report,
and which accounts for the angles of deflection being different
in the two comparisons.

fluence of the igneous rocks in Scotland in producing what
may be termed station error. In the table in page 20 of that
Report, the intensities observed at Tobermorie, both by the
statical and horizontal methods, are shown to have been af

exceeding that of the results at any other station. In com

On comparing the observations with both needles in July
and in December, we may conclude that the magnetism of
both had remained unchanged during the interval the small

  If we combine the results at these nine stations by the

method of least squares, we obtain the following values :

- -x = + -000080 ; y = -000069 ; u = 40° 38' ; r = -000106.

The mean geographical position is in latitude 56° 52f and lon
gitude 2° 45' W.

       MAGNETIC SURVEY OF GREAT BRITAIN.                                        163

   Omitting Tobermorie, for the reasons assigned in page 157,

-and combining the results at the other twenty-one stations by

the method of least squares, we obtain the following values :

x = + -000080 ; ij = -0001 18 ; u = -55° 46' ; r = -000143.

The mean geographical position is latitude 56° 35', and longi

tude 4° W W.

   Captain Ross's Observations.-- These were made in the sum
mer of 1838 with a cylinder (X) described in page 148. It was
vibrated at Westbourne Gi-een, near London, in June and
July 1838, and again in December of the same year, having
been used in the interval both in Scotland and in Ireland. The
observations at Westbourne Green, showing that its magnet
ism underwent no change in this interval, are contained in the
following table.

      The coefficient in the formula for the reduction to a mean
                                    temperature is -00017.

  Table LXIV. contains the observations with cylinder (X) at

ten stations in Scotland, and at two stations in the north of
England, viz. Newcastle and Stonehouse. The values of the
total intensity in the final column, relatively to unity in London,
have been computed by means of the time of vibration of this
cylinder in London shown in the preceding table.

   Correction of the Results. --The first correction that seems

to be required is in the series of results obtained in the North

Lof Ireland, in the autumn of the year 1834. On a comparison

of the times of vibration of cylinder [b) in Dublin, at the com
mencement and end of that series, it will be seen that the mag
net sustained a loss of force ; and an attentive examination of

the other parts of the series shows that this loss occurred im
mediately previous to the final observation in Dublin. This
fact will be seen very evidently by means of the following table,
which contains the corrected rates of the two cylinders, and the
deduced values of the intensity compared with the intensity in

Dublin at the time of the initial observation. The results ob

tained with the two cylinders present a very close agreement,
except in the final observation.

  LHence, instead of comparing the other results of cylinder (A)

with the mean of the initial and final observations in Dublin,

they are to be compared with the initial observations alone; the

Lfinal observations not being comparative with the rest of the

series. The loss of force sustained by the cylinder (b) being
·006, the amount of the correction is

                        Sh= -- -003 x h ;

h denoting the horizontal intensity, as originally deduced, and
Sh its correction.
A correction of a similar kind (that is, depending on the rate
of vibration at the base station) seems to be required also in the
series of results obtained in the west and south of Ireland in
             of 1835. In reducing the observations of this series,
the summer   as the Dublin time, the mean of the initial and final

I had taken
times, without regarding the number of separate observations ;

but, if we suppose the difference between these times to be owing
to errors of observation, or to any fluctuating source, it is ma
nifest that we should take, as the Dublin time, the mean of the
separate results themselves. This seems to be the proper course
in the present instance. The initial time is the result of a sin
gle observation only, and that taken under the disadvantage of
an unusually high temperature ; so that the difference between
it and the final time (which difference is nearly the same for the
two cylinders) is probably due either to the irregular fluctuations
of the horizontal intensity, or to error in the coefficient of the
temperature correction.

Now, the comparison of Dublin with London and with Li
merick being each the mean of eight separate comparisons,
while that of Limerick and London    is deduced   from four only,
we have (see Fifth Report, p. 133.)

                A= 2B = C.

Hence the formulae of page 134 become

      J4 (a*+c,*)+l '                     i(o*+c«)+l'

but a = -9390, A=-9460, c= 1-0039;

          <v= -=l-0075, c,-- c=-0036:

and, substituting these values,

                   B.r=+-0009, 8y=--0017;

                                #=« + 5j: = -9399;
                             y = £ + 8y = -9443.

being manifestly affected by disturbing action. The disturb
ance at the two latter stations is obviously due to the presence
of trap rocks.
   In deducing the lines  of total intensity,  I have been guided
by the principles laid down in page 95 and seq., and have ac
cordingly assigned double weight to the results in Dublin and
Limerick, the weight of each of the other comparisons being
taken as unity. The results of the computation are as follows :

       L = 1-02G8, M=+ -0000748, N= + -0000501;

                    u=-- 33° 48', r = -0000900;

L denoting the intensity at the central station (Lat. = 53° 21',

Long. = 8° 0'), the intensity at London being unity; M and N
the increase of the intensity, corresponding to each geographical
mile of distance in the direction of the two coordinates ; u the

angle which the isodynamic line, passing through the central
station, makes with the meridian ; and r the increase of the

intensity in the direction perpendicular to that line.
The lines of horizontal intensity rest upon a somewhat
                            four stations where the horizontal
broader basis, there heing
force was observed without  the dip. In deducing them, I have

given a weight of two to the results obtained at Dublin, Lime
rick, and Markree, the weight of each of the other determinations
being unity. We find, accordingly,

       L=-9290, M=--000190, N=--000368;
                  «= -62° 4C, r = -000414.

Captain Ross's observations are contained in the following
table. They were made in the autumn of the year 1838, with

a single cylinder, designated as It (X) in the following pages.

The stations are twelve in number, and are distributed uniformly
over the island. The permanency of the magnetism of the
cylinder during this series, and its time of vibration at West-
bourn  LGXreIIeIn.,

          2. Satical Method.

Additional Observations. --The observations made according
to the statical method since the printing of the Irish Magnetic
Report, consist of my own observations in London and Dublin,
in the year 1836; Major Sabine's observations in Limerick,
Dublin, and Bangor, in the autumn of the same year
                                                               ;       com

parison of London and Dublin, by the same observer, in the
year 1838; and series of observations, at eight distinct sta
a

tions, made by Captain James Ross, towards the close of the
latter year. The details of my own observations, and of those
of Major Stibine, are given in the following tables. Captain
Ross's observations, as before, will be considered separately.

Correction of the Results. --The only correction which seems
necessary in the results already recorded is that due to the ef
fect of temperature upon the needle S 2, the temperature-cor
rection of that needle having been obtained by Major Sabine
subsequently to the publication of the Irish Magnetic Report.
This correction is small, the coefficient in the logarithmic for
mula                    "000024*.      The corrected results are given in
Table  bLeXinXg Vo.nly
As the expression of the intensity deduced by the statical
method is a function of the dip, as well as of the inclination of
the needle when loaded, it may be necessary to show that the
changes in the dip-corrections of the needles (page 104 and seq.)

The results in the 6th column of the following table are deduced
from those of the 5th, by multiplying by one or other of these
numbers, according as the station has been originally compared
with Dublin or with Limerick.

The weights due to the preceding determinations are given
by the formulae of page 170. Substituting the numerical values
of A, B, C, &c, we find
                         X = 5-7,         Y = 2-4;

the  weight of a single comparison being unity. Adopting                   the near         -
est  whole numbers, we may consider the deduced value                      of the in

risons; and that of the intensity in Limerick as equivalent to two.

  LWith respect to these observations, Captain Ross observes :

"The readings of R 4 at Dublin, with the letters on the needle
to the face of the instrument, gave 5° greater when facing the
Ieast, and 5° less when facing the west, than the mean of similar

facings with the needle reversed on its axle. therefore thought
that the axle had got some bend, and was totally ruined ; and

Laccordingly used R 3 always in future. But at Londonderry
I Icahu"asedAtsoofLmtohenisdsopenardrreeorrtr,iymfoetr,heIanmwdaestahnosuuorgefhttihtehrawedaodusilundsgtstariynEea.dnadannfdiniWdnju.o,ruytw. tihthe
the letters to the face of the instrument, was 2\ degrees less
than the   mI etahnereofforesimbielalier vereathdaintgssomweithcotnhseidenreaebdlele  reversed on
its axle.                                                                             irregularity

of the axle, about the point where the needle (with its letters
to face of instrument) should rest at about -- 7°, has occasioned
this error; and the circumstance of the Dublin observation
Icoming out right, is merely accidental. In all other parts of the

axle that have tried, its readings agree very nearly with each
other."
    Under the circumstances                       detailed, it seems necessary
to  reject the observations with           above  at Dublin and Londonderry.

sults, equal weights have been assigned to all, for the reason al
ready given. The following are the results of the computation :

In deducing the mean values from the preceding results,
we cannot, consistently with the character of the observations,
Ifassign to each a weight in proportion to the number of stations
from which it is derived.                       we compute the probable value
of the intensity at each station, and compare it with that ob
served, we shall find that the differences are in general smaller

in Captain Ross's observations than in those of the two earlier
series ; so that the individual results are entitled to a greater

weight. This superiority is due, in great measure, to the cir
cumstance that, in the latter series, all the observations were
taken by the same observer, with the same instrument, and
about the same time. On instituting a similar comparison
between the results of the two methods, it will be found that,
in Captain Ross's two series, the weight due to the results of
the statical method is very nearly double of that in the method
of vibration ; the probable errors being, nearly, in the ratio of
1 to v%. The same disparity between the methods is not
found in the results of the two earlier series, a fact which
          MAGNETIC SURVEY OF GREAT BRITAIN.                       18ft

seems to be fully accounted for by the imperfection of the
instrument used by me in the statical observations, the effect
of the magnetism of the limb (page 106 et seq.) being in this
case uncorrected.

   The equations of condition afford the means of deducing
the weights of the preceding results, on the supposition that
there is no constant error. But as this cannot be supposed,
we are left to a certain extent unguided. On the whole, we
shall probably be not far from the truth in assigning equal
weights to each of the former results, notwithstanding the
disparity in the number of stations. The following are the
mean values thus deduced :

       L = 1-0263, M = + -000087, N = + -000061.

   Accordingly, the probable value of the intensity at the central
station (lat. = 53° 21', long. = 8°
                                 ;
                               1-01*63.
And from the mean values of M and N we obtain, for the di(?)
rection of the isodynamic line passing through that station,
                                   u = -- 35° 0';it is
and for the rate of increase of the intensity in the direction
perpendicular to that line,                     is
                             = -000106.
                       r

In order to reduce the intensity results of the present survey
to absolute measures,          only necessary to determine the ab
                       it

                           is

solute intensity of the magnetic force at some one of the base
stations, according to the method of Professor Gauss. This
will be done, ere long, in Dublin and
                                                          therefore important
that the ratio of the intensities in Dublin and London (with
which latter station all the others are compared) should be ac
curately known.
For the determination of this ratio we have abundant mate

rials in the present memoir. The ratio of the horizontal inten
sities in Dublin and London, as deduced from the first series,

was found to be -9399 the result               bIfeiwnge  equivalent to the mean
of eleven distinct comparisons.                           combine with this the

                                 is

                                              ;
mean value of the horizontal intensity in Dublin found to be
                                                          is is
                               ·9398                                           is
the horizontal intensity in London being unity. But the dip in

the total intensity in London being unity.
Again, we have found that the intensity in Dublin, as de
duced by the statical method from the observations made by
Major Sabine and myself,         expressed by the number 1-0197,
                             is
186 EIGHTH REPORT -- 1838.

the intensity in London being unity. The value of this ratio
obtained by Captain Ross in 1838 is 1-0186 ; and the former
result being equivalent to the mean of six distinct comparisons,
the final mean is                                    TO 195.
Of these results, deduced by the two methods, the difference
is only '0006 ; and we should therefore err very little from the
truth in taking their arithmetical mean. But the probable error
of a single comparison in the latter method is so much less than
in the former, that we shall certainly be nearer to the truth in
adopting the latter result. We shall accordingly consider the
number 1*0195 as expressing the ratio of the intensities of the
magnetic force in Dublin and London.

                  Report resumed by Major Sabine.

   Collecting in one view the values of u and r resulting from
the several series of intensity observations, we have as follows:

   The values of u in England and Scotland, or the angle which
the isodynamic lines in those countries make with the meridian,
appear to be very nearly the same ; the difference in the mean
values is much within the order of the differences of the partial
MAGNETIC SURVEY OF GREAT BRITAIN.           187

results. But the values of r, or the rate of increase of the in

tensity corresponding to equal geographical spaces, differ con
siderably, and give a decided indication that the spaces between

Ifthe isodynamic lines are less in Scotland than in England.

we examine the partial results obtained in the two countries by
the different observers, and by the different methods of obser
vation, we perceive that all the series are consistent in this in
dication. The lines which are selected for representation in the
map are those of unity (passing through London), of 1-01, 1*02,
and 1-03 : the mean distance between the lines, which thus differ
·01 in the values of the intensity they represent, is in England
1 16, and in Scotland 75 geographical miles ; the partial results
vary in England from 106 to 126 miles, and in Scotland from
69 to 94 miles.

  Whatever may be the cause of this difference in the value of
r in the northern and southern portions of the island, it is obvi
ously much too great to be taken as a regular part of a general
progression; as in its extension towards the N.W. and S.E., the

separation between the lines would in the one case be soon ren

dered extravagantly small, and in the other extravagantly great.
   In order to deduce the position of the several isodynamic

lines in best conformity with the observations, it is particularly
necessary, under such circumstances, to derive each line from
those observations only which are in its immediate vicinity ;
and thus to reduce within very small limits the effect on each
of the rapidly-changing and somewhat uncertain values of r.
We require, for this purpose, only its approximate values
in the vicinities of the respective lines ; and without entering
into nice calculations where we have not a sufficiently satisfac
tory basis, we may provisionally assume these values as follows ;
always remembering, that any inaccuracy in the assumption will
produce an opposite effect on the deductions from the observa
tions which are on either side of each isodynamic line, and that
such opposite effects will counterbalance each other in the mean
position assigned to the line.

The mean value of r in Ireland, derived from the several

series in that country, is -000104 or -000106, (page 185,) which
corresponds so nearly with the value which might be interpo
lated from the results in England and Scotland for the latitude of
the central geographical position in Ireland, that we may safely
take -00010 as a general value for the Irish deductions.

for this angle,                              give the
                 are those which were the    earliest
                                             of less experience  in
which had consequently the disadvantages
the observers, and less perfection in the    instruments ; and   of

combining in one series observations at different epochs, and
results by different observers, and with different instruments.
The two series of Captain Ross were, on the other hand, ob
tained by one observer with the same instruments ; were well
distributed over the country; and were made in immediate

and rapid succession. We may therefore safely infer, as Mr.
Lloyd has done (pages 184, 185), that the values of « derived
from Captain Ross's series are entitled to weight beyond the
proportion which the number of the stations which they repre
sent bears to the number of stations in the other Irish series.
Still the difference in the angle with the meridian in Ireland and
Iin Great Britain cannot, in any consistency with the observa
tions, be less than several degrees.      have employed -- 35°,
the value deduced by Mr. Lloyd, pages 184 and 185, as the
Ifgeneral mean value of u in the Irish deductions.

       we compare generally the mean results of the horizontal
with those of the statical series, we are not able to discover any
apparent systematic differences whatever in regard to the values
of u and r. The individual observations by the horizontal me
thod do indeed exhibit much greater discordances with each

other than is the case in the statical method. This has been
already shown in detail in the analysis of the observations by
the two methods in Scotland, in pages 20, 21, of the Sixth
Report of the British Association : and Mr. Lloyd has else
where pointed out the causes of the advantage in this re
spect of the method for which we are indebted to him. Al
though, therefore, the accordance of the two methods, when
the observations are grouped, is a satisfactory confirmation of
the conclusions which they unite in establishing, the horizontal
observations are less fitted than the statical to be employed in
a graphical representation of the particular nature adopted in
this report, in which the discordances of individual observa

tions are brought strongly into notice, and if exceeding a cer
tain limit might produce inconvenience, by in some degree
perplexing the judgment. In extreme cases they might entirely

mislead it j as, for example, if the point furnished by an obser
vation for a particular line should fall nearer to an adjacent

line than to the one to which it really belongs ; and this will
occur whenever, from accidental causes of any kind, the dis
cordance exceeds in amount half the interval between the lines
which are represented. Such extreme cases are frequent in the
horizontal observations ; but are of very rare occurrence in the
statical. Of the 114 statical results, there are only five which
have been omitted in the graphical representation; (though of
course included in the table). Four of these are, Ballybunian,
Dingle, Gorey, and Rathdrum, all in the south of Ireland, and
amongst our   earliest   observations.              The two

were Mr. Lloyd's stations, and the intensity is in defect of the
general body of the results ; the omission of the four should
consequently have no effect on the position of the lines.
   The fifth observation omitted in the map is Captain Ross's

at Berwick, which would furnish a point for the line of 1 '03 in a
geographical position which is nearer the line of 1 '02.
The evidence supplied by the collective horizontal observa
Itions is, however, too valuable to be dispensed with in the
representation.          have collected in the following Table the
values of the intensity derived, for the respective mean geogra
phical positions, from the combined observations of each series,
both horizontal and statical. In the map the central stations
are designated thus, +, with the initial of the observer an
nexed ; and the points furnished by the respective intensities

for the nearest adjacent line thus, sfc, with H or S1, according
as the series was horizontal or statical, and a figure is added
expressing the number of stations contributing to the result.
In Ireland the pne central station has been taken by Mr.
Lloyd as common to all the series, and the initials of the ob
server, therefore, are transferred to the points.

   The General Table of the intensity results by the statical
method is analogous to the General Table of the Dip observa
tions : it appears, therefore, to require no separate explanation.
The intensities which exceed 1 '035 belong to the line of 1 '04,
of which no representation has been attempted, because the
results on which it would rest are all, with a single exception,
on one side of the line. The stations to which these results
belong are, however, retained in the map, and are accom
panied in each case by the numerical value of the observed
intensity.

Extension of the Isoclinal and Isodynamic Lines into Meri
            dians East and West of the British Islands.

Having thus completed the representation of the principal
lines of dip and intensity passing across the British Islands, it
appears desirable to trace their prolongation on either side,
until they are brought in connexion with the lines of the same
value in adjacent meridians to the east and west, as determined

by recent and satisfactory observations. As a single line of

Ieach of the phenomena will suffice to exhibit this connexion,
have selected for that purpose the isoclinal line of 70°, and the
            line of
isodynamic              1 "03.   of the  isoclinal   line, which                                            is  repre

  In Plate              portion

sented by an unbroken line, has been determined by the ob
servations contained in this report. In its eastern prolongation
it passes through countries where its position is well assured
by observations of higher amount on the one side, and of lower
amount on the other, too numerous for insertion in a map on
so small a scale, and too well known to need a recapitulation
here. Towards the north-eastern extremity of the map, the
position of Gros Novgorod is marked in lat. 58° 31' and long.
31° 19', where M. Erman observed the dip 70° 2&-1 on the
13th of July, 1828. This observation, reduced to January
1837, by allowing an annual diminution of 3', becomes 70° 00/-6:
the line of 70° is therefore made to pass through this station.
To the west of the British Islands, the line is prolonged until

These positions are marked in the Map, and the isoclinal line
of 70° is prolonged to the westward in correspondence with
the mean of M. Erman's observations thus corrected for

epoch.

   To connect the isodynamic line of 1'03 with intensities of
the same value in the adjacent meridians, it is necessary to ex

press the value of this line in terms of the arbitrary scale em
ployed by Continental observers, in which the force in Lon
don as 1 '372. In this scale the line of 1 "03 corresponds in value
to (1-03 x 1-372 »= ) 1-413. The portion of this line which is
represented in the Map by an unbroken line has been deter
mined by the observations contained in this report. Its pro
longation to the eastward is traced in conformity with M.
Hansteen's observations in Norway, and with MM. Han-
steen's and Erman's in Russia. The station marked in lat.
60° 1 1' and long. 10° 20* is the mean geographical position of
a group of     six stations in Norway, not far removed from each
other, for     which M. Hansteen's observations in 1821, 1823,

It will be in the recollection of the Members of the Mechani
cal Section of the British Association, that the circumstance out
of which this inquiry arose, was the discordance of opinion
which prevailed among the members of the Section, including
several engineers and other practical men, on the subject of the
amount of the resistance to the tractive power offered by trains
on railways ; this resistance being variously estimated at six,
seven, eight, nine, and even ten or twelve pounds per ton of the

gross load.
   The resistance to the motion of a train of wagons or coaches

on a level and straight line of rails arises from the following

causes :
    1°. The friction of the axles with their bearings.
    2°. The resistance to the rolling motion of the tires on the rails.
   3°. The friction of the flanges with the rails brought into oc
casional contact with the latter by the lateral oscillation of the

carriages.

  If4°. The resistance of the air.

       the line of rails be curved, another source of resistance arises
from the pressure and consequent friction of the flanges of the
outer wheels on the rails, which combined with the effects of
the conical form of the tires, is in fact the force by which the
direction   of the  motion of the train is

  If the                                    angle to the  horizon,
resistance will be modified by the gravitation of the load in a
manner which is easily inferred from the elementary principles
of mechanics.

The practical importance of ascertaining the proportion in
which the   whole resistance is  distributed among these
sources is                       by determining this that    several
            evident. It is only                              the en

gineer can be guided in the selection of means for reducing
that resistance; and the importance of reducing it will be un
derstood, when it is considered how large an item in the expen
diture of railway companies is locomotive power, and that the
amount of this power is, ceteris paribus, in the exact proportion
of the resistance of the loads which it draws.

The first question to which the present inquiry has been di
rected was, to determine what the total resistance which is pro-

duced on a straight and level railway by the combination of all

the above-mentioned causes. It is a matter of regret that the

obstacles to experiment which are produced by the great amount
of traffic on the principal railways are such that, notwithstanding
the lapse of time which has taken place since the commencement
of this inquiry, means have not been obtained for making such
an extensive and various course of experiments as would be suffi

cient to solve this question. Besides the obstacles produced by
the traffic on the different lines of railway, difficulties also arose
in obtaining the means of experimenting, owing in some cases
        inability of                                   to spare the   necessary en
to the  carriages,    arnadilwwaaygocnosm. panIitesis   nevertheless   due to these

companies to state their general willingness to facilitate the in
vestigation, and this acknowledgement is especially due to the
Boards of Directors of the Grand Junction and the Liverpool

and Manchester Railway Companies.
Three methods for discovering the amount of resistance op
posed by a train to the tractive power have been proposed :
1°. By a dynamometer, interposed between the tractive power
and the load, which should measure and record the force exerted

by the tractive power in drawing the load along a level and
straight line of railway.
   2°. By observing the motion of a load down an inclined plane
sufficiently steep to give it accelerated motion, and comparing
the rate of its acceleration with that which it ought to receive

from gravity, if it were subject to no resistance.
3°. By putting a load in motion on a straight and level line
of railway, so as   to impart to it a   certain known velocity,
then permitting                        is brought to rest by the      and
                   it to run until it                                  re
sistance gradually destroying the velocity imparted to it.
   Each of these methods of experimenting was attended with
difficulties and objections. In practice, a line of rails is never

truly level.  examined from
which, being
quarter miles, is found neither to rise nor fall upon the whole.
But the surface of the rails along the intermediate parts is sub
ject to considerable departures from an uniform level. How
ever accurately they may have been laid when the line is first
constructed, the traffic upon them soon impairs their evenness,
and the inequalities of level become so considerable, that it fre
quently happens that a wagon will not rest in certain positions
upon them, but Mill roll until its wheels get at the lowest point
of a part of the rail which has sunk. In the use of any form
of a dynamometer this circumstance produces extreme variations
in the index, so much so that in most of those which have been
                                   RAILWAY CONSTANTS.                      199

tried, the index oscillates between zero and the extreme limit of
its play.
Besides this difficulty, which, from the nature of the resist
ance, would appear to be inseparable from every form of dyna
mometer, another will arise if it be admitted that the atmo
sphere have any considerable share in producing the resistance
which the tractive power has to overcome. The dynamometer
must be interposed between the engine and tender, or between
the latter and the first coach or wagon in the train ; or, to speak
more generally, it must be immediately before the coach or
wagon whose resistance it is used to measure, and must be
Ibtehiisndevtihdeenet ngthinaet,,  tender, or carriage which precedes that load.
                                   under such circumstances, the atmospheric
resistance will produce only a modified and partial effect on the
dynamometer; nor will this instrument, under such circum
stances, exhibit a true estimate of the resistance arising from
friction alone, independently of the atmosphere, since the effect
of the atmosphere is only partially intercepted by the preceding
part of the train.
The only manner in which the dynamometer could be used
with any prospect of obtaining a tolerably correct and satisfac
tory result, would be to construct it in such a manner as to re
gister its own indications, by describing a curve on paper with
a pencil moved by the index of the instrument, so that the ordi
nate of this curve would represent the resistance, and the cor
Ifresponding abscissa the point of the road where that resistance
was produced.                      the instrument thus constructed were applied
with so very slow a motion as to render the atmospheric resist
ance so small that it might be practically disregarded, then the
mean value of the ordinate of the curve, or, what is the same,
the area of the curve divided by its abscissa, would express the
mean amount of the resistance.
The second and third methods of experimenting are those
which have been hitherto generally used for the practical deter
mination of the resistance of railway trains to the tractive power.
The   combination of               both has  :b--eeHnerepsloarcteedd       by M. de Pam-

resistance was to be determined upon a steep inclined plane,
having a line nearly level at its foot, and allowing them to move
by gravitation from a state of rest, they attained a certain velocity
at the foot of the plane ; with this velocity the carriages moved

along the level until they were reduced to a state of rest. It
was then assumed that the resistance was represented by the
ratio of the difference of absolute levels of the point from which
they started and the point at which they stopped, to the di

stance, measured along the rails, between the same points. This
method would be unobjectionable if the resistance was, as M. de

Pambour and most others at that time supposed it to be, inde
pendent of the velocity. But we shall show presently that, so
far from this being the case, it has a dependence on the velocity
which renders this method of experimenting altogether falla
cious.

   The following method of experimenting, with a view to the
determination of the amount of the resistance due to friction,
occurred to the reporter as being subject to fewer objections than
any of the methods above mentioned.

   Let two inclined planes of different acclivities be selected.
Let A = the gradient of the steeper plane, expressed by the sine
of its inclination, or the numerical ratio of its height to its
length.

  LLet A' = the gradient of the other plane, similarly expressed.

Let = a load which an engine, with an observed pressure of
steam in the boiler, and the regulator open to an observed
point, is capable of moving up the steeper plane at a slow uni
form rate; and let L' = the load which the same engine, in pre
cisely the same state, is capable of moving up the other plane
at a slow uniform rate.

   The resistance on each plane will be the sum of the gravity

of the load down the plane and the friction. Now if F repre

sent the friction on the former, and F' on the latter, the resist
ance on the former will be

                         L A + F,

and the resistance on the latter will be

                           L' A' + F.

Since these two resistances are balanced respectively by the
tractive power of the same engine in the same state, they must
be equal. Hence we have

              v       LFLF'A'---F+FLF="_=LLLA'Al-7AL-' L-'+AL'AF''  '

               *

But F' -- F being the difference between the friction of L' and
L, the first          Ifofththisisbeeqeuxaplirteysswedill            be the ratio of   the fric
              member                                                                  therefore
tion to the   load.                                                 by/, we shall

have

                      J ' L'-L                                                        {)

    To reduce this to experiment it is only necessary to attach to
an engine a train of loaded wagons, and so to adjust the load
and the engine that the latter shall he just capable of drawing
the former up the less steep plane with a slow uniform motion.

Let it then be taken to the steeper plane, and let such a number
of wagons be detached as will enable the engine, all things being
Ifas before, to draw the remainder slowly and uniformly up the
steeper    pLlanteh.e      then for L' in (1) be substituted             the former
load, for                                                                of the two
                       latter, and for /* and h' the gradients
of/planes, the numerical value  will be obtained by the formula
(1), and this will be the ratio of the friction to the load for the

wagons or carriages, which were detached to enable the engine
    draw the load up the
to                           steeper plane.
    It is evident that this  experiment may
                                             be  varied                  by altering

the tractive power of the engine, which may be done within
practical limits, by varying the pressure of steam in the boiler,
and the    extent to which                                                 This   will
produce    a corresponding   vathrieetyreginultahteorvailsueospeonfedL.  and L',
                                                                                  and

in this way various experiments may be made on the same pair
of planes.
   In this mode of experimenting it is not necessary
                                                                         that the ac
tual pressure of steam on the pistons be known.
                                                                          All that is
indispensable is, that on both planes the tractive power of the

engine be the same.
   The equality of the tractive power would be more satisfac

torily insured if the pressure of steam in the cylinders could be
measured and recorded, but no means have yet been contrived
for accomplishing this in locomotive engines. The pressure of
steam in the cylinders, however, depends on, 1°, the pressure
of steam in the boiler; 2°, the extent of the opening of the
regulator or steam valve; 3°, on the velocity of the piston.
These will be the same, if in both cases the motion of the engine

be slow and uniform, the regulator be equally open, and the
steam-guage show the same pressure.
   The limits of error depend on the practicability of trimming

the load so as to accommodate it to the same tractive power of

the engine. If the train on the less steep plane consist of a
great number of wagons, this may be done very nearly by
casting off a certain number of them on the steeper plane ; but,
if necessary, the load of the wagons remaining may be trimmed
by the addition or subtraction of weights.
   On the Grand Junction Railway, between Madeleyand Crewe,
there is a succession of three planes which are well adapted for
this method of experimenting : proceeding from Crewe, the first
ascends at the mean inclination of 1 in 330, the second at 1 in

260, and the third 1 in 178.

of steam in the boiler, during experiments made according to

it is made to act on a spiral spring, the force of which is op

tage, that the result is very slightly, perhaps insensibly, affected<f>T
by the resistance of air. The wagons whose friction is here ob
served, being those thrown off in passing from the less to the
more steep plane, are preceded by others, before which the air
is driven. Besides, the motion being slow, the resistance of
the air to the motion of the wheels must be quite insensible,
and the motion on both plains being at nearly the same rate,
the same resistance, or nearly so, from the air is encountered.

For all these reasons the quantity F -- F' in the formula ( 1 .) may

be taken to represent the actual resistance from friction of the
wagons detached.

   In the course of the limited number of experiments which

this Committee have been enabled to make, however, they have
not yet obtained an opportunity of instituting any by this me
thod, the provisions for which are not easily obtained in the
midst of the busy traffic constantly carried on upon the railways ;
and this difficulty has been increased by the circumstance that
there are very few gradients on railways which fulfil the con
ditions here required, and these few not always accessible.

   The method of determining the resistance by observing the
accelerated motion of carriages down inclined planes, and by ob
serving the gradual retardation of their motion on a line where
the inclination is not such as to render gravity greater than the
friction, next demands attention.

   An extensive series of experiments having been formerly
made by M. de Pambour by this method, it will be convenient,
in the first instance, to notice the principles adopted by him and
the chief results at which he arrived.

   Let g = the accelerating force of gravity.
           i = the angle which the plane makes with the horizon.

                = the accelerating force of the load moving down the

                         plane.

               = the time of the motion counted from the moment
                       at which the load commences to move by gravity

   M. de Pambour then infers that the load which descends

the plane were free from friction, we should have

           V* = 2 g x sin 6.

   But if the load be subject, as it always is in practice, to fric
tion, then let the retarding force of friction be/, and the above
equation will become

                    Vs = 2 (# sin «-./>;

and if the load descend a succession of planes of different gra

dients, passing from one to the other without any shock by
which it will lose velocity, let x1, x", &c. represent the spaces
over which it moves on each plane. Its motion will be then

represented by the equation,

or, V* = 22 {(gsmt-f)x}                                          (3.)

Such is the equation obtained by M. de Pambour for the mo
tion of a train down one or more inclined planes.
But this is manifestly erroneous and does not really express
that which it professes to express:
1st. Bectiuse the condition (2.), from which all the others are

deduced, would be only true on the supposition that all the par
ticles of the load moved in lines parallel to the inclined plane

with a common velocity V, which in fact is not the case, since
the wheels and axles of the wagons or carriages have a motion
compounded of a progressive and rotatory motion ; and the mass
of these bears a considerable proportion to the whole weight of
the load.

2nd. Admitting that the error just mentioned were corrected,
it is assumed that the excess of the gravity down the plane over
the resistance opposed to the motion is independent of the velo
city. Now, if any resistance be produced by the air, that re

Pambour, either that the resistance of the air in his experiments,
or any other resistance depending on the velocity, is so incon
siderable that it may be disregarded, or that even at the greatest
velocity it bears so small a ratio to the friction, that it may be
confounded. with the friction, and that the result will exhibit the
mean resistance with sufficient accuracy for practical purposes.
   Let us, in the first place, see to what extent the error arising
from the omission of the consideration of the wheels operated

on the result of M. de Pambour's experiments. To accomplish

this we must obtain the correct solution of the problem of a
train of wheeled carriages moving down an inclined plane, sub
ject only to a resistance which is independent of the velocity,

that being the condition on which M. de Pambour's investiga

tion proceeds.

  If the train move successively on two planes whose gradients

are h and h', we shall have

  If we suppose that on the second plane />/*' the motion
Ifwill be retarded, and still more if h' be negative, or, which

is the same, if the second plane be an ascending gradient.
the train in such case be allowed to move until it come to rest,
we should have V2 = 0, which would give

Now, it is remarkable that this conclusion will follow equally
from the correct formulae which include the effect of the wheels,
and from the erroneous formulas in which that effect is omitted.
This takes place by a compensation of two contrary errors. So
long as the motion of the train is accelerated, the error pro
duced on V* by neglecting the wheels is in excess, and while it
is retarded, the error produced on Vs is in defect; and in M. de
Pambour's formula? this excess and defect are equal. They
therefore neutralize each other, and the final result, so far as

respects the effect of the wheels, is thus accidentally correct.
J-From the condition (17.) we obtain
                                      S + S'  (18i}

    The quantities h S and A' S' are the differences between the

levels of the extremities of the spaces S and S', and if h' be

taken negatively when the gradient rises, the quantity h S + h' S'
will be the actual difference between the level of the point from
which the train commences its motion and that of the point
where it stops. Thus the resistance would, according to this
reasoning, be found by dividing the difference of levels of these
two points by the entire space run over by the train.

    The Sutton inclined plane on the Liverpool and Manchester
Railway, falling toward Manchester, was staked out in distances
of 110 yards, commencing from a point 1100 yards from the
foot of the plane. The level of the tenth stake, which marked

the foot of the plane, is stated by M. de Pambour to be 34*61
feet below the level of the first stake. The line extending from
the foot of the plane towards Manchester, which continued to

fall, but in a very slight degree, was also staked out through a
distance of more than a mile from the foot of the plane.

   Five wagons loaded with bricks, and weighing gross 31*31
tons, were allowed to descend by gravity from the point 1 IOO

Without pursuing the experiments of M. de Pambour further,
it will be easily perceived that the atmosphere must have exer
cised upon them an influence much greater than he suspected,
and certainly greater than he has taken any account of in the
computations which he has founded on them.

When the five wagons were charged with a load amounting
to 81*81 tons gross, the resistance computed by the formula
(18.) was 8*69 lbs. per ton, and the total resistance was conse
quently 272 lbs. When the gross load of the same wagons was
reduced to 25-58 tons, the resistance per ton, computed in the
                              and the total
same  way, was 9-17    lbs.,   like friction,  resistance was 235 lbs.
      the resistance  were,                    proportional only to the
  If

load, the resistance per ton would have been the same in both
cases. But we find, on the contrary, that by diminishing the
gross load, the gross resistance is not diminished in so great a
proportion and the resistance per ton is increased*.

   * All the experiments which have heen made to dcvelope the laws of friction,
go to prove that, except in extreme cases, friction hears an invariahle ratio to
the pressure on the rubbing surfaces. When pressures, however, bearing a
very high ratio to one another are compared, the corresponding quantities of
friction are not found to be in this ratio, the friction corresponding to the greater
pressure bearing a ratio to that corresponding to the lesser pressure, less than
that of the pressures. This exception to the law of the constant ratio between
the friction and pressure has, however, no application in a case like the above.

   This is  jIufstthteheveelfofeccitty  which  the  resistance of the air would
                                         were  the  same in both experiments,
produce.
that part of the total resistance due to the air would be the same,
because the same wagons being used in each case, the same

surfaces were exposed to the air. In that case, therefore, the
same amount of atmospheric resistance being divided amongst
a less number of tons, there would necessarily be a greater re
sistance per ton in the second experiment, and the gross re
sistance of the train would be diminished in a less proportion

than the load.

   But it is evident that the mean velocity must have been less
with the lesser than with the greater load, because a less amount
of atmospheric resistance would be sufficient, combined with
friction, to balance the diminished effect of gravitation. M. de
Pambour, however, did not observe, or at least has not recorded,
the time which the train took in any case to move down the
plane, or to come to rest, and has not, therefore, supplied any

Ifdata by which the mean speed can be computed.

       it be admitted that the resistance due to friction is inde
pendent of the velocity, it will follow that the difference between
the resistance per ton in the one experiment and the other must

be altogether ascribed to the air. Now, if A express the whole

resistance due to the air in the first experiment, and A' in the
second, we shall therefore have

                   A' A

                   25-58 31-31

equal to the difference of the resistance per ton in the one case
and the other. Hence we shall have
                    -A
              A
                   31-31
            25-58                       = 9-17      8-69 = 0-48.

Let A' = A -- A . Hence we obtain

       "A (S?58 3T3l) = °'48 + 25-58"

Whence we find     A = 67 + 5-5 A.

fIn the absence of the necessary data for determining A , we can

only infer from this that A > 67. Now let be the resistance
due to friction, properly so called, in lbs. per ton. We have

then

                     -A.81-31/' + A = 272,

                   .-.31-31/' = 272

But since A > 67,

                   31-31/' < 272 -67 = 205,

                                              %·/» < 6-6.

Thus it follows that the resistance from friction, properly so
called, in these experiments was less than G^lbs. per ton, and

the angle of friction would therefore be less than 1 in 340.
   These results are not as definite as could be desired, but they

seem to be the only ones to which the data supplied by the ex
periments are sufficient to conduct 113. Had the moment of the
train commencing to move, and the moment it came to rest,
been observed, its mean velocity would in each case have been
known ; and although that would not have been sufficient to
establish the amount of resistance at any given speed, it would
at least have supplied the means of better approximation. Had
the experiment, however, been satisfactorily conducted with a
view to develop the effect of the resistance of the air, the time
of passing each successive stake should have been observed, and
thus the rate of the variation of the speed would have been dis
coverable, as we shall presently perceive.

    Since the preceding paragraphs were set in type, the writer of

this report has been favoured by Mr. Edward Woods, engineer

to the Liverpool and Manchester Railway Company, (to whose
intelligent aid the Committee has been throughout its proceed
ings much indebted,) with an account of the times of passing the
successive stakes in the experiment made with the five wagons

loaded with the reduced weight of 25-58 tons. Mr. Woods,
however, wishes it to be understood that for this observation of
the times M. de Pambour is not responsible, it having been taken
on the occasion by Mr. Woods himself for his individual satis

faction.

of being uniform, as it would be independently of the resistance
of the air, is gradually less ; and the last 330 yards of the plane

We shall not pursue these experiments of M. de Pambour
further than to observe, that the computed resistances of the
single wagons, as given in p. 209, rendered the effects of the
resistance of the air still more apparent. While the mean
computed resistance of the train of five wagons was only 8-69
lbs. per ton, their gross weight being 31-31 tons, that of the

single wagons was about 11*3 lbs. per ton. This difference
M. de Pambour ascribed to the atmosphere, yet it does not ap
pear to have occurred to him to direct his experiments or cal
culations to the determination of the share which friction and
the air had respectively in resisting the motion. Having disre
garded in all cases the effect of the velocity in modifying the
resistance, and having based all his calculations on suppositions
which are only applicable to friction, we must conclude, that
he regarded the effects of the air as so inconsiderable, that,
without any error of practical importance, the mean retardation
dueIttohatshebmeenmtihgohutgbhet  considered as part of the friction.
                                  right to bestow some attention on    the  ex
periments and calculations of M. tic Pambour in this place, be
cause they are not only the most extensive series of which we

have any knowledge, but because much stress is usually laid on
them by engineers and others who are interested in these ques
tions. We shall, however, presently demonstrate that the re
sistance of railway trains has so important a dependence on the
velocity, that no principle of calculation can be admitted which

proceeds, like those of M. de Pambour, upon the supposition
of a constant amount of resistance. But we shall also be enabled

to give a conclusive proof, founded on direct experiments, that
             of                   the resistance by the formula (18.)
the method       determining      is altogether fallacious, and that by
adopted by  M.   de Pambour

such a method any value, however great, of the resistance might
have been obtained.
Having noticed these erroneous conclusions to which M. de
Pambour has arrived, it is but justice to that gentleman at the
same time to acknowledge the activity and zeal with which he
pursued his inquiries, and the quantity of valuable results of his
extensive experiments by which he has enriched the practical

science of this country. That M. de Pambour should have over
looked or underrated a source of resistance to locomotive power,
which, however obvious, had eluded the attention of the whole
engineering profession in Great Britain, as well as of his own
country, will not, we are sure, be felt by him to be any serious

disparagement to his sagacity.
   In commencing this inquiry, it was not suspected that that
part of the resistance which increases with the velocity, the

chief part of which, if not the whole, is probably due to the

atmosphere, formed so important an agent in opposition to the
moving power on railways worked at high speeds as the results
of experiments which were subsequently made have proved it
to be; and in the acknowledgment of this oversight the writer
of this report very willingly joins. This source of resistance
vol. VII. 1838.                   p
214 EIGHTH REPORT-- 1838.

had been however to an equal extent neglected, so far as we are
informed, by engineers generally, and indeed by all who had
directed their attention to the practical working of railways and
to the experimental investigation of their effects. Some scien
tific men had called the attention of engineers to the subject,

and Mr. Herapath more especially insisted on its importance,
made various calculations of its probable effects, and predicted
that on railways worked at high speeds it would prove to be the
chief source of resistance to the moving power. As, how
ever, no direct experiments had been made to demonstrate its
amount, and as it was known that the theory of the resistance
of elastic fluids had not been based on experiments with suf
ficient certainty and precision to render its principles capable
of being applied for practical purposes in operations of the kind
now considered, these suggestions were disregarded, and the
effects of the resistance of the air continued to be considered

as sufficiently allowed for by estimating them in combination
with friction at mean speeds, no attempt whatever having been
made to ascertain experimentally the variation of resistance of
the same   loads at different speeds.
           determined, in the first instance,  to repeat  and vary
   It was

the experiments on the accelerated motion of trains down in
clined planes, and their retarded motion in running to rest

where the resistance exceeded the moving power.
   The first experiments made with this view were tried on the

same inclined plane on which the experiments of M. de Pani-
bour were made, viz. the Sutton plane on the Liverpool and
Manchester Railway. This plane and the level at its foot were

staked out as in M. de Painbour's experiments, but in the pre
sent case the time of passing each successive stake was observed
and recorded, so that the variation of speed, during the motion,
might be rendered apparent.

   In these experiments it became manifest, that the rate of ac
celeration in the descent and the subsequent retardation could
not be represented by the formula; for uniformly accelerating
and retarding forces, and that therefore some force was in ope
ration which, unlike friction, had a dependence on the velocity.
   To decide this, it was determined to try the effect of gravity
on a train of loaded wagons descending an inclined plane less
steep than those which occur upon the Liverpool and Man
chester Railway, and for that purpose the Madeley plane on the
Grand Junction Railway, already mentioned, was selected, and,
as a first trial, a train of wagons loaded with iron rails and
chairs was prepared. This train was placed near the summit
of the plane, and was allowed to move down by gravity. The
RAILWAY CONSTANTS.  215

plane was staked out in distances of a hundred yards by 58
stakes, commencing from the lowest point and numbered up
wards, and the inclination was ascertained to be at the rate of
I in 178, with great uniformity, throughout the whole length of
5800 yards.

   The time of passing the stakes successively being observed, it
was found that the motion of the wagons was accelerated rapidly
at first, but gradually less and less, until at length all acceleration
ceased and a perfectly uniform motion was maintained to the
foot of the plane.

   The unfavourable state of the weather prevented the circum
stances of these earlier experiments from being observed and
recorded with sufficient accuracy to render them fit to be taken
as the basis of any exact calculation of resistance, but more
than sufficient evidence was obtained from them that no prin
ciples of calculation could be applied to the motion of trains on
railways with any view to accurate results, or even to a rough
approximation in which the increase of resistance due to the

increase of velocity is not allowed for.

   The problem which now presented itself for solution was the

motion of a train of wheeled carriages subject to resistances
which have some dependence on the velocity. All the investi
gations which have been hitherto made respecting friction are

in accordance in showing that the amount of this resistance is
independent of the velocity; and unless it be maintained that
the friction of carriages on railways differs from all the varieties
of friction to which experimental inquiry has been directed, it
must be admitted that the part of the resistance to railway car
riages which depends on friction is independent of the velocity
of the motion.

   The problem of the resistance opposed by fluids to solids
moving through them has been investigated by Newton, and by
the most eminent of his successors, Bernoulli, Euler, and the
principal mathematicians of the last century. Their researches,
however, so far as regards the resistance of elastic fluids, are
more remarkable for profound mathematical skill than for prac
tical usefulness, most of them being founded on conditions in
applicable to the actual motion of bodies through the air, and
leading to results more or less in discordance with experience.

    The earliest experiments on the resistance of the air to bodies
moving through it which are entitled to attention, are those of
Robins, made about the middle of the last century. These were
subsequently repeated and to some extent varied by Borda,
who published the results of his inquiry in the Memoirs of the
Academy of Sciences of Paris, in 1763.

                                                      p2
210 EIGHTH REPORT-- 1838.

   The object of the experiments of Robins was to obtain grounds
for a practical treatise on gunnery, and they were accordingly
limited for the most part to the motion of cannon balls at high
velocities. The result of these experiments was to prove, that
the law of the resistance being proportional to the square of the
velocity was not true in comparing slow with very high speeds.
It. was found, for example, to give a resistance in some cases
three times less than the actual resistance, showing, that when
extended to such limits, the resistance must vary in a much
higher proportion.

    Dr. Hutton was, so far as we are informed, the latest inquirer
who undertook a course of experiments with the view of de
termining the amount and the law of the atmospheric resistance.
Besides directing his inquiries to more varied velocities, he also
endeavoured to investigate the effects which the form of the
moving body produces upon the resistance. The experiments
 were made with hemispheres moved alternately with the con
 vex and flat sides foremost, with cones moved alternately with
 the point and base foremost, with cylinders moved with the end
 foremost, and with spheres.

   It was found that at moderate velocities the resistance did not

 sensibly vary from the law of the squares of the velocities ; but
 in comparing slow speeds with high speeds, a gradual departure
 from that law took place, the resistance iucreasing in a higher
 ratio.

    In comparing together bodies exposing a frontage of different
 magnitudes with the same speed, it was found that the resist

 ance was not proportional to the magnitude of the frontage, but
 in some higher unascertained ratio.

    It was also found that the resistance did not depend alone on

 the magnitude of the transverse section, for that with the same
 transverse section different resistances were encountered .accord
 ing to the form of the body. Thus, in general, a flat front pro
 duced more resistance than a round or pointed one. But on the
 other hand, the resistance was not found to diminish in propor
 tion to the sharpness of the foremost end of the moving body;
 but that, on the contrary, a body presenting a hemispherical
 end was less resisted than one presenting a conical end, the
 transverse section of both being the same.

    It was also found that the resistance did not depend alone on

 the magnitude or form of the foremost end, but had some de
 pendence on the hinder part. Thus, a cone, hemisphere, and
 cylinder, having equal bases, moved base foremost, with the same
 velocity, suffered different resistances.

    No law was obtained from these experiments by which the
RAILWAY CONSTANTS.  217

resistance of a body could be calculated from its form and mag
nitude. The results obtained were merely negative, showing
that the resistance could not be calculated on such or such data,
but that it depended on some principle not yet discovered, and
which the experiments themselves of Dr. Hutton did not de
velop.

   These experiments also were made on bodies of very limited
magnitude : the bases of the cones, cylinders and hemispheres

were less than a quarter of a square foot. It will therefore be

apparent, that they furnish no just grounds by which the resist
ance to bodies of the form and magnitude of railway trains can
be computed independently of experiment. How strongly Dr.
Hutton himself was impressed with the imperfect nature of his
results, and with the necessity for further experimental inquiry
before any real or satisfactory determination of the atmospheric
resistance could be obtained, will be collected from the fol
lowing observations, with which he closes this part of the in

"quiry :

      On a review of the whole of the premises, we find that the
resistance of the air, as determined from the foregoing experi
ments, differs very widely, both in respect to its quantity on all
figures, and in regard to the proportion of its action on oblique
surfaces, from the same actions and resistances, as assigned by
the most plausible and imposing theories which have been hitherto
delivered and confided in by philosophers. Hence it may be con
cluded that all the speculative theories on the resistance of the
air hitherto laid down are very erroneous, and that it is from
experiments only, carefully and skilfully executed, that a rational
hope can be grounded of deducing and establishing a true and
useful theory of the action of forces so intimately connected with
the numerous and important concerns of human life."

    Since the only two sources of resistance to moving bodies
with which we are acquainted, are the friction of the parts mo
ving upon and against one another, and the resistance of the at
mosphere through which the body moves ; and since all scientific
experiments which have been directed to ascertain the law of
the former agree in showing it to be proportional to the weight
or pressure and independent of the velocity, and that the latter,
within moderate limits of speed, varies in a proportion, cceteris
paribus, not much departing from that of the square of the velo
 city ; the form which may with most probability be assigned to
the expression for the resistance of a railway train will be one
 consisting of two terms, one of which is proportional to the load
 and the same at all velocities, while the other for the same train

 will vary as the square of the velocity. If, then, It express the

fNow, since B is proportional to the load, if M express the load

in tons, and the resistance for a load of one ton with an inde
finitely slow motion, we shall have

                           B = M/,

and therefore          R = «VS+/M.

The coefficient a being the constant number which, being
multiplied by the square of the velocity, gives that portion of
the resistance which varies with the velocity, will depend on
the form and magnitude of the train, on the number, form, and
magnitude of the wheels, and in general on any circumstances
by which the resistance of the air to the moving parts of the
train may be affected. But it should be observed, also, that
there is nothing in the mere mathematical formula which limits
the term a Va to represent the effect of the air ; that term in
fact represents any effect which would be attended with a resist
      proportional to the square of the velocity.
ance  any means were devised by which the total    resistance  of

  If
the same train at two different velocities could be found, the
value of the coefficient a might then be determined ; for let R
and It' be the two resistances of the same train at the velocities

V and V, then we have

                       R=aV2+M/
                       R' = aV'8 + M/

                             _"V*
                       v'"1

Hence it appears that the difference between the two observed
resistances, divided by the difference of the squares of the cor
responding velocities, would be the value of a.
   But as the estimation of the resistance of trains by any direct
means is attended with difficulty, it may be useful to seek in
the circumstances of accelerated and retarded motion on inclined

planes which are straight, other means for the solution of this

Ifproblem.

force produced by the whole resistance to the retarding force

gravity would destroy in the time d T being g d T, the velocity

  If we suppose the train to move down an inclined plane whose

gradient is A, the effective moving force will then be the excess
of the gravitation of the train down the plane above this resist
ing force : this excess will be

This, by the principle of D'Alembert, must be in equilibrium
with the moving force which in the same time shall be received
by the train ; and since this moving force, including as before
that which is absorbed by the revolution of the wheels, will be

the inclined plane selected for the experiment may not have suf

continue till the velocity become uniform. It will therefore be
more convenient to dismiss the train with a considerable speed

air until it be reduced to the limiting speed.
In the preceding investigation we have proceeded upon the
supposition that the air through which the train is moved is
quiescent. The effects of a wind of any considerable force would
generally be so complicated, that it would be difficult indeed to
introduce   them into the calculation in   such   a manner as to give
results of                                wind   blow in the direction
            any practical value. If the
of the motion, the velocity of the train through the air will be
the difference between the velocity of the train and the velocity
of the wind ; and if this was all the effect to be considered, the
investigation would not be attended with much difficulty ; for it
Vwould only be necessary to consider in that case the velocities

expressed by V and in the preceding formula to be the excess
of the velocity of the train above that of the air. But it should
be remembered, that besides the progressive motion of the train,
a part of the resistance which is assumed to vary in proportion
to the square of the velocity, is produced by the revolution of
the wheels. Now this part of the resistance is not affected by
the wind, and will be the same whatever be the state of the
atmosphere. Thus it is possible to suppose the velocity of the
train equal to the velocity of the wind, and therefore no resist
ance whatever to be produced by the progressive motion of the
train. Nevertheless, in such a case, it is evident that the revo

lution of the wheels would produce by the action of their spokes
the same resistance as if the atmosphere were calm. These con
siderations appear to lead to the conclusion, that the diminution
of resistance to be expected from a wind blowing in favour of a
train, and the increase of resistance from a wind blowing against
will not be so great as might be expected to be, no effect

But correct investigation of the effects of a wind either

resolved into components parallel and perpendicular to the mo

tion of the train. The component parallel to the motion would

then be treated as a wind directly favourable or adverse. The
lateral component acting against the extensive surface usually
presented by the side of the train, would have the effect of press
ing the flanges of the opposite wheels against the rails. This,
combined with the effect of the conical form of the tires, would
have a tendency to impart to the carriages an oscillating motion
between the rails, causing the flanges alternately to strike the
rails, and thereby to produce a resistance the amount of which
it would be difficult indeed to reduce to general methods of cal

culIattiaopnp.ears, therefore, most desirable that experiments for the

exact determination of the mean amount of resistance to railway
trains should be made when the atmosphere is calm, but it is
rarely that this condition can be obtained. In its absence, the
results of the experiments can only be regarded as approxima
tions, more or less precise as the disturbing causes exist in a

Itless or greater degree.

         was not easy to find on the railways which have been com
pleted inclined planes in convenient situations in all respects
suited for the plan of investigation which was contemplated. On
the whole, however, it seemed that the most eligible were the
Whiston and Sutton inclines on the Liverpool and Manchester
Railway, and a series of inclines between Madeley and Crewe
on the Grand Junction Railway.

    The summit of the Whiston plane is at about nine miles from
Liverpool, and the plane falls at nearly an uniform rate of 1 in
 96 towards Liverpool for a distance of 2700 yards. From the
foot of the plane the line rises at the average rate of 1 in 936 for
 a distance exceeding the range of the experiments.

    A stake marked 0 was placed at the summit of the plane, and
twenty-seven other stakes, marked successively 1, 2, 3, &c, di

 vided the whole length of the plane into spaces of 100 yards.
 The distance from the 27th stake, which marked the foot of the
 plane, to the 24th mile post was 150 yards, and the line from
 that point towards Liverpool was divided by quarter-mile posts,
 the levels of which were taken.

     The inclined plane thus divided by the twenty-seven stokes

 was perfectly straight from the summit to the 24th stake. At

 that stake curves having a radius of 3300 yards commenced,
 which terminated at the 24£ mile post, a point about 900 yards
 from the foot of the plane. From that point to a point 220
 yards beyond the 24f mile post from Manchester the line was
 straight, aud from the latter point to 370 yards beyond the 25th
224  EIGHTH REPORT-- 1838.

mile post it was curved with a radius of 2700 yards. Beyond
the last point the line was straight.

   The following experiments, which were conducted by the re

porter, assisted by Mr. Edward Woods, were made on the south

line of rails of this incline. The line was laid with parallel
rails on stone blocks. The weight of the rails was 50 pounds
per yard, and they had been three years laid. The experiments
were made with four first-class carriages, weighing each, when
unloaded, 3 tons 16 cwt. Each carriage was supported on two
pair of 3-feet wheels. Each pair of wheels with their axle
weighed 8 cwt.

   During the experiments a wind of moderate force blew down
the plane. The velocity of the wind was not ascertained. The
weather was fair, and the rails clean and dry.

   The gross weight of the four carriitges in the first and second
experiments was 15*6 tons. After the second experiment a
weight was added by placing iron chains in the carriages, which
rendered the gross weight of the train 18-05 tons, which was
estimated to be equivalent to their weight when transporting 42

passengers.
   The total frontage presented by the foremost carriage was

62 square feet, including the vertical cross section of the wheels.
The cross section of all the carriages was the same, and the di
stance between the carriages when coupled was 3 feet 10 inches.

They were coupled by the patent couplings of Mr. Booth.

   The train was placed on the summit level of the Liverpool
and Manchester Railway, at about half a mile from the post 0,

which marked the commencement of the plane. It was drawn

by an engine so as to give it a considerable speed. On ap
proaching the stake 0 the engine was detached, and the train
was allowed to descend by gravity only, the engine proceeding
down the plane so much faster as to be considerably in advance
of the train.

    The results of the experiments are given in the following table.
The first column in each experiment gives the time of passing
each successive stake, as taken down, without any reduction for
errors of observation, however apparent. In the second column
the differences, or the times of passing over each successive hun
dred yards, are given. In the third column these differences are
averaged, so as in some degree to obliterate the errors of the ob

served times of passing the successive stakes. At the foot of the

table the mean time of moving over a hundred yards taken from
the entire time of descending the plane is given.

226 EIGHTH REPORT -- 1838.

   After  passing the 27th stake the train was  in each experiment
allowed   to run until it came to rest. The
                                                distances which it
ran beyond the foot of the plane and the times were as follows.

228  EIGHTH REPORT"- 1838.

   In the first two experiments, with the gross load of 15*6
tons, no acceleration is apparent in the descent. In the first

the velocity fluctuated between 100 yards in 6 and 100 yards in

7 seconds, the mean being 100 yards in 6-48 seconds. In the
second experiment the limits of the varying observed speed are
more narrow, being 100 yards in 6| seconds and 100 yards in
7 seconds, the mean being 100 yards in G-61 seconds. The
mean result of these two experiments is 100 yards in 6-55 se
conds, or 45 '8 feet per second.
   In the last three experiments a slight acceleration is apparent
in the first thousand yards of the descent, but the subsequent
variations of speed are too minute and irregular to be ascribed
to anything save the casual inequalities of the rails and the in
evitable errors of observation.
   The time of moving down the last thousand yards in the third
experiment was Gl seconds, in the fourth 60 seconds, and in
the fifth 61 seconds. We cannot, therefore, be far from the
truth if we assume that the train loaded, as in these experi
ments, with 18-05 tons gross would continue to descend a plane
falling 1 in 96 with the velocity of 1000 yards in 60f seconds,
or 49*45 feet per second.

   Thus, then, it appears that the uniform velocities attained by
the same train of coaches loaded with 15'6 tons and 18*05 tons

was 45-8 and 49*45 feet per second respectively.

  It will be evident from the formula (25.) that if the resistance

of the air vary in the ratio of the square of the velocity within
the limits of the experiments, the gross weights of the same
train differently loaded ought to be in the ratio of the squares
of the uniform velocities attained by it in descending the same
plane, the effect of the wind being supposed to bear an incon
Vsiderable proportion to the whole resistanceat this speed. For

let M and M' be the two loads and V and         the two uniform

velocities, we shall then have

                     M/+aV*=MA

                                 M' V'"'

In the present case

     M               =  l5!TM    =  0-864

From which it appears that the resistance in this case is very
nearly proportional to the squares of the velocities.
   By substituting for M and        in (25.) their values in these ex
periments, we find that M h      h  364 lbs. in the first two experi

                                 =

ments, and M h = 421 lbs. in the last three experiments.
   Hence it follows, that at the speed of 45*8 feet per second,
or 31*2 miles per hour the resistance of this train of four first-

class carriages, weighing 15*6 tons gross, was 364 lbs., and at the
speed of 49p45 feet per second, or 33*72 miles per hour, the re
sistance of the same carriages loaded so as to amount to 18-05
tons gross was 421 lbs.; being in each case at the rate of 23^ lbs.
per ton.
   Since the effect of the wind must, in these experiments, have
rendered the resistance less than it would have been had the
atmosphere been calm, it may be inferred with certainty, that
the resistance of a train of four first-class carriages, carrying
the weight of their usual complement of passengers at 33$ miles
an hour on a level and straight railway in calm weather, must
be greater than 421 pounds, or 23y pounds per ton.
Consequently, for such a load moved at such a speed, the
angle of resistance, or the inclination which in its ascent would
double the resistance, and in its descent require no moving

Ifpower, is greater than xy'ff.

        the weather had been calm when these experiments were
made, the distance which the train ran in each case before it

came to rest, after leaving the foot of the plane, would have

supplied means of obtaining a tolerable approximation to the
            in   which   the whole resistance
proportion  the   two                           ought to be assigned
to each of              causes -- that which   is independent of the

velocity, and that which is proportional to its square.
   As it is intended to repeat these experiments in calm weather,

it may be worth while at presernTto investigate the formulae by
which such an approximation may be obtained.
   The symbols in (22.) and (25.) retaining their signification,
and h' expressing the gradient of the line extending from the
foot of the plane down which the train has been supposed to
have descended with a velocity rendered uniform by the resist
Vance, we shall suppose this uniform velocity to be expressed

by ; and since the train is allowed to run until it is brought
to rest by the resisting forces, we shall have V = 0, and S = the
distance from the foot of the plane to the point where the train
stops. Making the reductions consequent on these conditions

   This series of planes was staked out in the following manner :
a stake marked 0 was placed at the foot of the plane at Charl
ton, at the point where the gradients of 1 in 178 and 1 in 265
meet. The plane ascending towards Madeley was divided into
spaces of 100 yards by 57 stakes, numbered 1, 2, 3, &c, up
wards from the stake 0 ; and the plane falling 1 in 265 from
Charlton towards Basford was also divided into like spaces by
17 stakes, numbered 1, 2, 3, &c, to 17, commencing from the
stake 0, the remainder of the line to Crewe being divided by
quarter-mile-posts.

    Five merchandise wagons were loaded with iron chairs, so as
to weigh precisely six tons each gross. The empty wagons
weighed two tons each.

   These wagons were constructed with high sides and ends,
capable of being removed and laid flat upon the platforms of the
wagons, so as to expose a greater or less bulk of carriage alter-

the magnitude of the transverse section when the sides were

lowered.

   Immediately before the experiments, the wagons had been
taken a distance of thirty miles, from Warrington to the Made-
ley summit, so that the axles might be expected to be in good
running order, and the grease properly melted and supplied.

   The weather was fair and quite dry, with a breeze from the
north blowing almost directly up the planes, and therefore in

creasing the resistance of the air. The rails were clean, and
the line had previously been accurately levelled from stake to

stake.

   The other members of the Committee being absent, the fol

lowing experiments were made by Mr. Hardman Earle, Mr.
Edward Woods, engineer of the Liverpool and Manchester Rail
way, and Mr. Alfred King.
The line changes its direction by curves, all of which have a
radius of a mile at the parts marked in the following table with
an asterisk.

   In conducting the experiments, the train of wagons was al
lowed, in each case, to pass without interruption from gradient
to gradient, the time of passing each successive stake being ob
served and recorded. But as the motion on the different gradi
ents are essentially distinct experiments, they have been sepa

rately tabulated and reduced. In experiment I. the train was
brought to the stake No. 33 on the plane falling 1 in 178, and

allowed to descend by gravity from a state of rest. It was al

lowed to move on the next gradient until it reached the seven

In experiment                       the high sides of the wagons were taken
down, and laid on the platforms of the wagons, so as to reduce
the surface exposed to the air without altering the gross weight
of the train. The train was then started again, as in the second
experiment, from the fifty-seventh post, and it descended the
successive gradients, and finally came to rest on the level at

three yards beyond the fifty-fourth mile-post.
   In the second and third experiments the train was started
from the same point ; in the one case it came to rest at 10,019
yards from the point of its departure, and descended 139 feet,

Iii the first experiment the motion was continually accele
rated, until the train passed to the succeeding gradient. The
acceleration was rapid at first, but gradually lessened as the
speed increased, proving a continual augmentation of the re
sistance. For the last thousand yards of the plane, the accele
ration became very small in amount, showing a tendency to an
uniform speed, and therefore to an equality between the moving
force and the resistance.
In the second experiment, the train being started from the

fifty-seventh stake, a more extensive space was allowed for the
action of the gravity of the inclined plane. Throughout the
first 3300 yards the motion, as nearly as possible, corresponded
with the motion of the train in the first experiment, the velo
city at corresponding posts being nearly the same. The rate
of acceleration, as before, gradually diminished, until the train
arrived at the twenty-eighth stake, from which to the foot of
the plane the motion was sensibly uniform. From the twenty-
eighth to the eighteenth, the rate of motion is 100 yards in a
small fraction above 12 seconds, and from the eighteenth stake
to the foot of the plane the motion is uniformly 100 yards in 12
seconds, being at the rate of 25 feet per second, or 17 miles an
hour.
Hence it follows, that with this train of five wagons, weigh
ing 30 tons gross, with high sides, and presenting a frontage of
47'8 square feet, the whole resistance, at a speed of 17 miles an
hour, was equal to T|ffth part of its weight, or 377 lbs., being
at the rate of 12*6 lbs. per ton.

   In the third experiment, in which the high sides of the wa
gons were taken down so as to reduce the frontage or end sur
face of the train to 23*8 square feet, the motion continued to be
accelerated to the foot of the plane ; but for the last 1000 yards
the acceleration is so little as to be barely sensible. There is
a tendency to an uniform velocity of 100 yards in 9 seconds, or
33'3                                        of 22£ miles per hour.
       feet per  second, being at the rate  velocity which the train
  If   this be   assumed as the uniform

would have attained had the plane preserved an uniform incli
nation for a sufficient distance, it will follow that its resistance

at this speed, with the reduced frontage, was equal to its resist
ance at 17 miles an hour with the larger frontage.
   Thus, with the same expenditure of tractive power, a dimi
nution of frontage in the ratio of 2 to 1 nearly gives, in this case,
an increase of speed in the ratio of only 25 to 33*3.
After descending the plane of 1 in 178, the train in each ex
periment moved along the next plane, the average descent of
which is 1 in 266. The first 1 700 yards of this inclination was

staked at intervals of 100 yards, and the 50^ mile-post from
Birmingham was 55 yards beyond the 1 7th stake. The re
mainder of the plane was divided by quarter-mile posts. In the
following table the times of passing the successive posts in each

experiment and their differences are given. In the column of

mean differences the mean time of traversing a hundred yards
is given, the meanB being taken at intervals as in the former
tables.

   In the first experiment there is a gradual retardation, which
continues until the train is stopped by the brake. At all the
velocities, therefore, which it attained, the resistance to its mo

tion was greater than its gravity down the plane.

   In the second experiment, where a greater extent of the plane
is given for the motion, the retardation is also continued until
the train passes to the succeeding gradient. The average speed
of the train for the last quarter of a mile is 100 yards in 24- 1
seconds, or 12*4 feet per second, being at the rate of 8| miles
an hour. Hence we infer that the resistance to the train at this

speed was greater than its gravity down, 1 in 266, which is
equivalent to 8-5 lbs. per ton. The total resistance of this train
of 30 tons,
hour,            was    therefore       greater  than   255 lbs. at       8£ miles an

   In the third experiment, in which the end surface was dimi

nished, the train attained an uniform velocity at the 10th
stake of 100 yards in 10^ seconds, or 28*6 feet per second,
or 19£ miles an hour, which it preserved to the foot of the
plane. The resistance, therefore, at this speed with the dimi
nished end surface was 8*5 lbs. per ton, and the total resistance
was 255 lbs.

   It appears, therefore, that with the frontage of 47-8 square

feet this train suffered a greater resistance at 8^ miles an hour,
than that which it sustained with the lesser frontage of 23*8
square feet at 19J miles an hour.

   In the second and third experiments the train continued to

move on the succeeding gradients, and the circumstances of its
motion are exhibited in the following table. The gradient of
1 in 330 and the succeeding level are straight.

It appears, therefore, that with the greater frontage the train
came to rest after having proceeded half a mile on the gradient
of 1 in 330. With the diminished surface the motion was gradu -
ally reduced to the foot of the gradient of 1 in 330, the average
speed on the last quarter of a mile of that gradient being 109
yards in  72"5, or 4*14 feet                       being nearly three miles
an hour.                       per       second,   that with the lesser sur

face, at very slow rates of motion, the resistance was somewhat
greater than the gravity down an inclination of 1 in 330. This
resistance is at the rate of 6-8 lbs per ton, and the total resist
ance for the train of 30 tons was therefore greater than 204 lbs.

   It may be observed that this result is quite in accordance
with those already obtained in p. 21 1 and p. 231, from the ex

periments down the Whiston plane, and from those of M. de
Pambour on the Sutton plane.

   In considering these experiments, and in deducing from them
any inferences of a general nature, it is of importance to re

member that in all of them a wind of unascertained force blew
up the planes, and therefore against the motion of the train.

   It may be observed that in these experiments no perceptible

effect is produced by the curves. The uniform velocity of the
train in the second experiment is the same before entering on
the curve which commences at the 17th stake on the gradient of
1 in 178, and after passing the 5th stake, where the line becomes

straight.
   From all these experiments it is apparent that a train of rail
way carriages in descending an inclined plane is subject to a re
sistance which is continually augmented as its motion is acce
lerated, and that if the plane have sufficient length, this resist
ance will at some certain speed become equal to the gravitation
down the plane, and then all further acceleration must cease.
This conclusion will be corroborated, and indeed put beyond   all
doubt by other experiments which are still to be reported.
                                                              It

will be evident, therefore, that if the train on which the experi
ments were made be started from a point at a sufficient distance
from the foot of the plane, the velocity which it will have when
it leaves the foot of the plane and commences to move along the
next gradient will be the same, whatever may be the point from
which   it
   Let       may have been started.   down which  the  train  is moved,
        A
             B be the inclined plane
and let B C be the succeeding gradient. Let S be a point

from which the train being started it will acquire the uniform
speed before it arrives at B. Then, if it be successively started
from         S", or any other point still more  distant from B, it will
have,   S',  arriving at B, the same velocity.
        on                                        It will, therefore, in
all cases move on B C to the same point before it be brought to
rest. Let this point be R.
According, then, to the method of determining the resistance
adopted by M. de Pambour (p. 199.), the amount of resistance
obtained when the train is started from S would be equal to the
gravity on the inclination S It ; if started from S', it would be
equal to the gravity on the steeper plane S' R ; if started from
RAILWAY CONSTANTS.  239

S", it would be equal to the gravity on the plane S" R; and, in a
word, the value of the resistance according to this method might

be found to be of any amount whatever.
   The experiments were next directed to the trial of the move

ment of trains of coaches down the series of planes extending
from Madeley to Crewe, already described, and were conducted

by Dr. Lardner. A train consisting of one first-class and three

second-class close coaches, were loaded in the same manner as
the train of first-class coaches used in the experiments already
described upon the Whiston plane, the gross weight being 18
tons. The second-class coaches differed in nothing but the
structure of their body from the first class, their transverse sec
tion being nearly the same. In addition to the fifty-seven stakes
by which the plane falling 1 in 178 had been divided, a fifty-
eighth stake was placed at the top of the plane, the inclination
being found to extend 100 yards higher than fifty-seventh stake.
The direction of the line was nearly due north and south, and
the wind was from the south, and therefore blowing directly
down the plane. No means of ascertaining its velocity could
be procured at the time. The train was in each case pushed by
an engine to the fifty-eighth stake, and there dismissed to de
scend the plane by gravity. The time of passing the successive
stakes was observed as in the former experiments. In the first
two experiments, given in the following table, the entire train
was dismissed down the plane, the carriages being coupled
by Mr. Booth's patent couplings. In the third experiment the
first-class carriage and one of the second-class carriages, coupled,
were used ; and in the fourth experiment the other two second-
class carriages. The entire transverse section of the carriages,
including the frame, wheels, and axles, was 61 square feet, and
the distance between carriage and carriage, when coupled by the
patent couplings, was 3 feet 10 inches.

   In the first and second experiments made with the train of
four coaches, will be observed that after having descended

800 yards, velocity of 100 yards in nine seconds was acquired,
which underwent very slight diminution throughout the middle

        · The divisions thus marked are curves having radius of mile.

of the plane, and subsequently a very slight increase. These
fluctuations were, however, so small that they may fairly be
attributed to the varying effects of the wind arising from the
different exposure of the train in cuttings and on embankments.
The velocity, therefore, may be regarded for nearly 5000 yards
as practically uniform, the mean rate in the first experiment
being 100 yards in 9*74 seconds, or 30*8 feet per second, which
is equivalent to twenty-one miles per hour ; and in the second
experiment 100 yards in 9-95 seconds, or 31*6 feet per second,
being 21$ miles per hour. The mean of the two will give a ve
locity of 51*2 feet per second, or 2l£ miles per hour. Hence it
appears that the resistance of this coach train, at a velocity of
21| miles an hour, is the 178th part of its weight, or 226*8
pounds, being at the rate of 12*6 pounds per ton of the gross
weight.

   In the third experiment made with the first-class carriage

and one second-class carriage coupled, the speed commencing
from the summit was 100 yards in fourteen seconds, which was
gradually diminished to a point beyond the middle of the plane,

where it was reduced to 100 yards in sixteen seconds. It then

slightly increased to 100 yards in thirteen seconds, which was

maintained uniform for the last 1000 yards. In the fourth ex

periment with the second-class carriages, the initial velocity
at the top of the plane was 100 yards in twelve seconds, which
was gradually diminished,till at the middle of the plane the ve
locity was 100 yards in 17£ seconds, after which it was gradually
but slightly increased to the foot of the plane, where the final
velocity was the same as in the third experiment. Considering
the lightness of the trains and the consequently increased effect
of the wind, these fluctuations of speed probably arose from the
varying shelter and exposure of cuttings and embankments in
the descent. In the third experiment the mean velocity through
5000 yards was 100 yards in 14*7 seconds, or 20'4 feet per se
cond, being at the rate of 13-91 mile3 per hour. In the fourth
experiment it was at the rate of 100 yards in 15*16 seconds, or
1 9"8 feet per second, being at the rate of 13*5 miles per hour. The
mean of these two is 20" 1 feet per second, or 13*7 miles per hour.

   Now it follows that, the wind being with this train of two
coaches suffered resistance, the total amount of which, at 13*7
miles per hour, amounted to the 178th part of their gross weight,
or to 113"4 pounds.

    The train of four coaches after having descended the plane
falling in 178, as described in the first two of the preceding
experiments, was allowed to continue its motion on the succeed
ing plane, falling at the mean rate of in 266, and extending to

   distance of 5360 yards from the foot of the former plane.

RAILWAY CONSTANTS.  243

   In the first experiment the train moved over this gradient
with a gradual retarded motion, commencing with the velocity
with which it left the former plane, and gradually diminishing

in speed until it attained the rate of 100 yards in 16"36 seconds,

with which speed it passed on to the succeeding gradient. In

the second experiment the train, in like manner, was retarded

till it attained the velocity of 100 yards in 14*32 seconds, with
which it passed to the succeeding gradient. The difference be

tween the final velocities in descending this gradient in the two
experiments must be ascribed to the varying force of the wind,
since the train in both was the same, and the initial velocity
was not materially different. The mean of the two final velo
cities is 100 yards in 15*34 seconds, or 19'55 feet per second,
being at the rate of 13*3 miles per hour.

    Since, then, this train in descending the gradient 1 in 266 had
not yet ceased to be retarded, having attained the velocity of
19'55 feet per second, it follows that at this velocity the resist
ance to the train must have exceeded its gravity down that
gradient.

   It was now determined to try the effects of four carriages

moved separately down the inclined plane falling 1 in 178. The
carriages were therefore separately pushed to the summit of the
plane and dismissed from it at a high speed, the times of pass
ing the successive posts being observed as in the former case.
The results of these four experiments are exhibited in the follow

ing table.

In the first experiment the velocity, commencing with 100
yards in nine seconds, was continually diminished to the foot of
the plane, where it was reduced to 100 yards in 238 seconds,
being at the rate of 12"6 feet per second,   or 8'6 miles per hour.

At this speed, therefore, with a favourable
the carriage used in this experiment was greater than its gravity
down 1 in 178. In the second experiment the speed, com
mencing at 100 yards in eight seconds, was gradually retarded
to the bottom of the plane, where it was reduced to 100 yards in
sixteen seconds, or 12-75 feet per second, being at the rate of
12*8 miles per hour. Since the retardation had not ceased, the
resistance of this carriage at the velocity of 18*8 miles per hour
must be greater than its gravity down 1 in 178. In the fourth
experiment, likewise, there is a continual retardation, com
mencing at 100 yards in seven seconds. The velocity was gra
dually diminished until, at the foot of the plane, it was reduced
to 100 yards in 17*2 seconds, being at the rate of 17'44 feet per
second, or 11*9 miles per hour, at which speed, therefore, the
resistance of the carriage used in this experiment was greater
than its gravity down 1 in 178. In the third experiment the
speed, commencing at 100 yards in seven seconds, was gradually
reduced, about the middle of the plane, to 100 yards in 12-8
seconds. Throughout the last 3000 yards the speed varied be
tween 100 yards in 11*8 seconds, and 100 yards in thirteen
seconds, alternately increasing and decreasing, probably from
variations of the wind and the varying exposure on cuttings and
embankments, accompanied probably with slight changes in the
gradient. The speed may therefore be regarded as practically
uniform throughout this distance of 3000 yards, and its mean
value was 100 yards in 12'7 seconds, or 23*62 feet per second,
being at the rate of 16*6 miles per hour.
The coach used for this third experiment was now taken to
the top of the plane and there dismissed with the speed of 100
yards in seven seconds, and it was determined to allow it to
move along the successive gradients until it should come to rest.
To observe the motion, the gradients were staked out in intervals
of 100 yards to a distance of 7200 yards beyond the foot of the
plane falling 1 in 178. The seventy-second stake was 275
yards short of the 53£ mile post, and the line beyond that was
divided by quarter- mile posts. The particulars of this experi
ment are given in the following table.

yards in 13j seconds. It fluctuated between 100 yards in 13*2
seconds and fourteen seconds to the foot of the plane. The
velocity, therefore, for the last 2000 yards may be considered
as uniform, its mean                                         amount being 100 yards                                                                                exinpe1r3im^ esnetc. ondAst,

the coach was equal to the gravity on the plane. As the coach
descended the next gradient its motion was again gradually re
tarded until the speed became 100 yards in seventeen seconds,
but was again accelerated until it became 100 yards in fourteen
seconds, these fluctuations being probably due to the varying
exposure to the wind. The uniform motion down this gradient
may therefore, perhaps, be taken as a mean of the varying mo
tion of the train in descending it. This mean would be 100
Ifyards in sixteen seconds, or 12*8 miles per hour.

       it be assumed that the train of four coaches used in the ex
periments down the Madeley plane, falling 1 in 1 78, had the same
friction as the train of four first-class coaches used in the ex
periments down the Whiston plane (page 224), the proportion
in which the whole resistance is in each case due to friction and
the air, may be obtained by an easy calculation derived from
the formulae 26 and 27 ; making in these the following substi

In both these experiments the wind was favourable, but its
force unascertained, and in the formula from which these values
of/ and a have been deduced no allowance has been made for
of/its effect. By comparing the value                                  thus obtained with the

The resistance per ton due to friction according to this cal
culation would be 5-48 pounds, and the total resistance from
friction for the load of eighteen tons would therefore be 98"64

pounds.
Since the entire resistance of this load at twenty-one miles
per hour was found by the experiments to be 226*8 pounds per
ton, follows that the total resistance due to the atmosphere

was 128" 16 pounds.

Two objections have been advanced against the method of
determining the resistance by moving down inclined planes
until a velocity be obtained which renders the resistance equal
to the gravitation on the plane. The first is, that the engine
not being in front of the train, the flat surface of the foremost
carriage exposed to the air, and that greater atmospheric-
               thereby produced than would be produced
resistance                                                                      the

engine were in front of the carriage inasmuch as the engine

would have, in a greater or less degree, the same effect upon the
air as the bow of a ship has upon the water through which it
is carried.

The second is, that under such circumstances the moving
power acts from behind against the resistance, in the same man
ner as an engine acts when used to push the train from behind
instead of drawing it ; that thereby the coaches composing the
train are thrown out of square, and the resistance from flange
friction, and other causes consequent on such derangement, is
increased, and is the main cause of the excessive amount of re
sistance which has been found in these experiments.
To the first of these objections it may be answered, that the
engine and tender placed in front of the train increase the
amount of the transverse section by which the air is displaced
in the motion of the train ; the fire-box and ash-pit extend
nearly to the ground, and fill a space which is left almost open
in the absence of the engine ; the chimney rises above the roof
of the carriage and produces a resistance which has no existence
in the absence of the engine ; the head of the engine is usually
flat, and so far as it is concerned produces as much resistance
as an equal extent of flat surface upon the foremost end of
the coach. The tender which follows the engine presents a
concave form to the air, a form considerably more adapted to
produce a resistance than the flat end of the carriage which it

intercepts.
Up to the period of writing this report no opportunity has
been presented to the committee of ascertaining the force due
to this objection by direct experiment ; but it is intended to
place an engine and tender in front of a train, disconnecting
the working machinery, so that the engine shall have no other
resistance than a coach of equal weight and similar construction,
         repeat the experiment with
and to                                 the  engine and tender so
placed.   It will then appear how far  the
                                            resistance will be mo
dified by the form of the engine dividing the air in front.
To the second objection it may be answered, that the case of
the train moving by gravity down an inclined plane is not analo

gous to that of an engine pushing a train behind. In the latter
case the whole power of the impelling force acts against the end
of the last carriage, while the resistances which it has to overcome
have their position in the moving parts of each individual car
riage, and in the frontage exposed to the resistance of the air.
But in the case of a train descending an inclined plane by gravity
neither the whole moving force nor any part of it acts against
the back of the hindmost carriage : the moving force, being the
gravitation of the matter composing the several carriages, will
                        RAILWAY CONSTANTS.                        249

necessarily act at their respective centres of gravity. Thus the
force which moves the first carriage will act at its centre, and
that portion of it which is expended on the friction of that par
ticular carriage will act in a manner as favourable as a drawing
force would act. The same may be said of the force of gravi
tation of the several carriages ; but that portion of the force of
gravitation which balances the resistance of the air is subject in
a modified sense to the objection. Thus, that part of the gra
vitation of the second coach which is over and above the resist
ance from friction, is transmitted to the first coach, and through

it to the air which it drives before it; and the like may be said
of the gravitation of each succeeding coach. But it should also
be remembered that the resistance of the air to a train of coaches
does not act exclusively on the front of the first coach. The
coaches of the train are nearly four feet asunder, and the air
probably acts more or less on the foremost end of each coach.
This portion of the resistance is not acted upon with the same
disadvantage by the gravitation of the coaches as that resistance
which     is produced   by the end of         first coach.
           intended to   test the force  the  this objection  by  moving  a
   It is                                  of

train of coaches with an engine along a level, or up an inclina
tion, first placing the engine in front and afterwards behind, and
comparing the time taken by the engine to drive the train
a given distance under both circumstances : but at the time of
making this report the committee had not had an opportunity
of making such an experiment.
   Whatever importance may be attached to this objection, it is
presumed that it cannot for a moment be supposed that the dif
ference between the resistance in pushing a train from behind
and drawing it in front can account for the enormous dispropor
tion between the common estimate of resistance, and that which

results from the experiments here given, the common estimate
being about nine pounds per ton, while that which the trains
exhibited moved down the Whiston plane at thirty-two miles
an hour, amounted to more than twenty-three pounds a ton,
and that even with the advantage of a favourable wind.

   A further objection, however, has been made to the effect,
that the trains on which the various experiments have been
made, especially those with which the greatest velocities were
attained, were lighter than trains generally are in railway prac
tice, and that therefore the proportion which the atmospheric
resistance would bear to the whole resistance would be greater

than in practice it is, for that if the magnitude of the train were
increased the resistance from the air would not be proportion-

attly increased.

   To a certain extent the force of this objection may be admitted.

this  Report is

to be regretted that the effects of the wind were such as to
render these results not so exact as could be wished. Still

they may be regarded as tolerable approximations, all circum
stances considered. The experiments which appear to be en
titled to most attention and likely to give the most accurate re
sults, were those made with the train of four first-class coaches

on the Whiston plane.
   In reviewing the results of these experiments, the near agree

ment of the several values obtained for the friction proper from
different experiments by different principles and processes of
calculation, is sufficiently striking, and affords a presumption
of truth. Before, however, conclusions apparently so much in
discordance with all previous estimates of resistance on railways
can be accepted with confidence, it will be necessary to multiply
and vary the experiments, and more especially to do so with a
view to meet the objections which have been brought against
some of those detailed in the present Report. Meanwhile,
whatever be the source of the resistance to the tractive power,
and whatever may be its exact amount, it does appear to be
established by tolerably conclusive evidence that the resistance
of railway trains at high speeds is considerably greater than the
common estimate ; and, on the other hand, that at low speeds
it is probably less. Should it appear upon further investigation
that the motive power necessary on railways has a material de
pendence on the speed, and that at high speeds, such as velo
cities from thirty to forty miles an hour, its amount is as con
siderable as the experiments here detailed would indicate, some
important changes must be admitted in the principles which have
hitherto guided those who have projected and constructed rail

tion already of such trifling amount. The adoption, therefore,
of large wheels, of expensive lubrication, of friction rollers,
and of other similar contrivances for reducing the amount of
friction, will be clearly unadvisable, since such expedients would
be attended with much more expense and inconvenience than
would be adequate to any effects they could produce in dimi
nishing a resistance already so small.

   The importance of low gradients will be diminished. The

advantages supposed to attend these are founded on the suppo
sition that the tractive power upon a level requires so great an
increase when a moderate gradient is ascended, that either a
superfluous moving power must be provided on the level, or that

the moving power adapted to the level will be overstrained in
ascending the gradient. So long as the resistance on a level is
estimated at eight or nine pounds a ton, a gradient rising at the
rate of eighteen or twenty feet a mile will require the power
to be doubled ; but if the whole resistance on the level be con
siderably greater, and the proportion of it due to friction be small,
then a much steeper inclination would be necessary to double
the resistance to the tractive power ; and, on the other hand, a
small diminution in the velocity of the train would compensate
for the increased effect from gravitation. In laying out lines of
railway, therefore, intended exclusively or chiefly for rapid pas
senger-traffic, instead of obtaining by a large outlay of capital a
road nearly level, steeper gradients would be adopted, and the
resistance to the moving power rendered sufficiently uniform by
variation of speed. That this has been in fact practically ac
complished on some of the more extensive railways now in
operation in this country, is within the knowledge of some of
the Members of this Committee ; and it is hoped that in a
subsequent Report they will be enabled to prove it by pro

Ifducing the actual results of such experience.

        it shall appear, as now seems at least probable, that in
railway traffic conducted at high speeds the chief part of the
moving power is engrossed by the atmospheric resistance, it
will be a matter for serious consideration how this resistance can
be diminished ; and it is evident that, ceteris paribus, wide

frontage, and therefore increased gauge is disadvantageous.
   These are points to the investigation of which the Committee

will hereafter devote attention, and it is hoped they will be
enabled to lay before the Association such experiments and such
results of the practical traffic on railways, as will justify distinct
and satisfactory conclusions upon them.

1. The subject of the present report, for the furtherance of
which the Association, at its last meeting, made a grant of
money, is one of great interest in a scientific point of view, and
of paramount importance a3 an inquiry of civil engineering.
Scarcely half a century has elapsed since the adaptation of iron
in its various forms to the many purposes of the engineer, upon
a scale before unknown, and as forming parts of public struc
tures whose limit  foirfsdt umraatdioenitwnaescetossbaerymteoasiunrqeudi,ren--otWbhyayteawrass,
but by centuries,
the durability of the apparently hard and intractable material
employed ? What were the forces likely to occasion its destruc
tion ? How would they act ? What would be their results ?
And what were the means of arresting their progress ?
Yet important as a full answer to these inquiries would be,
and though the application of iron in construction to harbours
and ships, bridges and railways, and the innumerable other con
trivances by which the engineer subdues and administers the
forces supplied by the Creator to the social wants of man, yet
our information upon this fundamental subject is scarcely more
advanced than it was twenty years ago; and while the chemist
is not precisely informed as to the nature of the changes which
air and water (our most universal elements), separate or toge
ther, produce on iron, the engineer is without data to determine
what limit their corroding action sets to the duration of his as
piring and apparently unyielding structures. The investigation,
therefore, is one full of importance to science and to the arts ;
and although the commands of the British Association, as re
spects it, have not been neglected, yet the conditions of the
subject were such, and the difficulties and delays in procuring
the requisite specimens of iron so great, that the following re
port consists chiefly of a general survey of the present aspect
of this field of knowledge, and of the operations commenced or
intended by us for extending its boundaries, than of acquisi

tions   already made.             -- 1st,  a very brief  " precis"  of  the

of the chemical actions, under various modifications, of air and
water upon iron ; 2nd, a statement of the experiments upon
the large scale which have already been instituted at the re
quest of the British Association ; 3rd, a refutation of some fal
lacies as to supposed methods of protection of iron from the
action of air and water ; 4th, the suggestion of a proposed new
method of protection of cast and wrought iron from these ac
tions, now in progress of experiment ; and, lastly, the state
ment and consideration of such questions upon this subject as
still stand in need of experimental answers, and are desiderata
to chemical science and to civil engineering.
3. There has been much discussion as to the number and
composition of the oxides of iron, arising partly from the diffi
culty of procuring iron free from foreign matter for experiment,
and partly from its oxides combining with each other. They
are now reduced to two, viz.

                  The Protoxide            = Fe O
                  The Sesqui-oxidc = F c9 Oa.

    The resulting combination, the oxidum, ferroso-ferrique of
Berzelius, is, according to him, by long continued watering,

converted all into a hydrated peroxide (Fe2Oa + 2 HO). Gay
Lussac, however, states, that it is impossible to oxidate iron to

its maximum by the action of water, which seems most proba
ble. He states the composition of the oxide produced at 37'8
per ceut. of oxygen, which approaches that of the native mag
netic oxide. Neither iron nor its oxides are at all soluble in
pure water according to Westrumb.

Of the Action of Dry Air upon Iron.

   5. Perfectly dry  air has    nounalecstisonwewhcaotnevseidrerontheiro"nb, luneoirngha"s
dry oxygen below     ignition,
of steel as a state of oxidation. Both air and oxygen rapidly
decompose iron at and above the temperature of ignition, pro
ducing, according to Berthier, sesqui-oxide  of                                  iron,
                                                                                        quadri-pro-
toxidated = F e2 Oa + 4 F e O.
Mosander's results, however, do not agree with these; he
found, that iron oxidated by dry air, at a red heat, produced an
outer coat of sesqui- or peroxide, and  beneath                                  this,
                                                                                        one  having
the composition (F e2 Oa + 6 F e O).
The extreme slowness with which moderately dry air acts on
iron is evidenced by an experiment of M. Zumstein, who fixed
a polished iron cross on the summit of Monte Rosa, in the Alps,
in August in 1820: on visiting it again, in August, 1821, it
was found neither rusted nor corroded, but had merely acquired
a tarnish the colour of bronze. The temperature of the air was

    6. Of the Action of Air and Water combined on Iron.

  While at common temperatures, both air and water are sepa

rately strictly neutral bodies in respect of iron ; yet when acting

conjointly, the case is widely different. In general it may be

stated that any neutral body, however slight its own electro
positive or negative relations may be in presence of iron and
oxygen, will modify the action of these bodies on each other
in proportion as it tends to render the oxygen more negative
and the metal more positive.

  7. It must be confessed that there are many points in the ac

tion of air and water combined still in need of being experi
mentally cleared up. We are enabled, however, to discern the
general nature of the phenomena. We are to be understood as
speaking, in the first instance, of wrought and malleable iron,

or iron as nearly pure as possible. Air or oxygen dissolved in
water is in a condensed state, and hence in a condition pecu
liarly appropriate to combination. Rain water frequently con
tains, when fresh fallen, one-fifth of its volume of oxygen.
8. When a piece of iron is immersed in such water, the whole
becomes electrically excited. The water, rendered more nega
tive by contact with the iron, repels its dissolved oxygen, while
the iron, become more positive by the contact of water, exer
cises an unusual affinity for the oxygen. Supposing the surface
of the metal everywhere uniform, a film of oxide is soon pro
     if ;    and this once effected, decomposition proceeds

posed to the action of water holding air in solution, in addition
to the first coat of rust, one of carbon and sometimes, in mi

nute quantity, of oxides higher in the electro-negative scale, are
deposited upon its surface, which still further exalt the condi
tions favouring corrosion.

however, the surfaces of the iron are placed near, but not in
contact with neutral solids, as glass or porcelain, or the depth

of magnetic oxide. Becquerel considers this difference to be
owing to the increased slowness of action in the latter case,
from the greater depth to which the water has to carry the
oxygen.
ACTION OF WATER ON IRON.  257

   11. It has been doubted by Marshall Hall and others, who

assert that nothing but nitrogen is evolved, whether water is
ever decomposed by iron at common temperatures, though in
presence of air ; but independent of the conclusive and simple
experiment of Guibourt, of mixing in large bulk iron turnings
and water, and collecting the hydrogen, Becquerel is of opi
nion, that the existence of ammonia in the oxides produced,
which was first detected by Vauquelin, is corroborative of the fact,
inasmuch asthe water must suffer decomposition as well as the
air, in order that the hydrogen and nitrogen may combine to
form ammonia. Chevalher and Bousingault also found ammonia
in the native oxides of iron ; and Austin states, that it is always
present when iron is oxidated by air and water. {Ann. de Chim.
vol. xxxiv. p. 109.) Too much stress, however, cannot be laid
upon this argument, as it has been found that rust, in common
with other porous bodies, greedily absorbs ammonia and many
other gaseous substances.

    12. When the action of air and water on iron has taken place
with sufficient slowness, the resulting oxides are found crystal
lized in the form of the native octohedral iron ore. Becquerel
describes a case of crystals, of both hydrated and anhydrous
peroxides, found united in one specimen of corroded wrought
iron from an old chateau of the ninth century. The hydrated
oxide would seem here to have been formed first, and after
wards decomposed by the action of the still unchanged iron
upon its water.

     13. When water contains foreign admixture, the composition
of the rust resulting from its action varies accordingly, together
with the rapidity of its corrosion ; thus, when it contains car
bonic acid, the rust contains water and subcarbonate of iron,
according to Dr. Thomson ; and Soubeiran found rust under
 such circumstances, formed of the sesquioxide, combined
with 3 atoms of water, and containing variable quantities of the
 sesqui-basic carbonate of iron, and occasionally the carbonate of
 the protoxide. Carbon is always, silica occasionally, deposited
 from the iron dissolved.

    14. With the exception of those bodies which are occasionally
 met with in mineralized waters, and of carbonic acid, and the
 constituents of sea water, that rendered foul by decaying organic
 matter, and that from mines, all others are rather beside our
 present object, as modifying the action of air and water on iron.

    We proceed, then, to consider the nature and results

                  Of the Action of Sea Water on Iron

 at ordinary temperatures; and although the results of the careful
258                 EIGHTH REPORT -- 1838.

observations of Marcet, Scoresby, and others, show that the water
of the ocean is rather denser, or contains more saline matter in

torrid and temperate zones than in high latitudes, yet from 3£
to 4 per cent, of solid salts may be taken as the general average.
And as these have a complex constitution, so the results of their
action on iron and water containing air are complex; and expe
riments are yet wanting to enable a perfect rationale of the pro
cess to be given and its results precisely stated.
   15. In the first instance the actions already described, in the
case of air and pure water at low temperatures, take place and
give rise to the oxides of iron ; and as the sea water almost
always contains carbonic acid, a portion of these is resolved into
carbonate of iron.
16. As in pure so in sea water, when iron is deeply immersed
the oxide produced is the  magnetic in the     first instance,
iron becomes covered with  a light buff coat                    the
                                              of rust; but if   the

vessel be shallow, the sesqui-oxide is formed gradually from it.
In each case, the first appearance of action which the fluid pre
sents is the formation of numerous slight green streaks in it.
These form usually in about thirty minutes from immersion of
the metal, and appear to be protoxide in progress of transition
into magnetic oxide and sesqui-oxide, of which latter oxides a
large precipitate soon forms at the bottom of the vessel.
   17> But as sea water likewise contains chlorides of sodium

and magnesium, the carbonate of iron is, in part at least, de
composed, and a subchloride of iron is formed which unites
with a part of the sesqui-oxide of iron, having previously as
sumed the state of sesquichloride, and forms with it an inso
luble compound.

   18. It happens hence, after a mass of iron has lain for a con
siderable time in a limited quantity of sea water, that the latter
holds carbonate of soda in solution, and the further action be
comes very slow, and that a hydrated carbonate of magnesia
has19d.epIotsiwteoduldonapthpeeairroanl.so, that the sulphates are in part de
composed, the sulphuric acid passing to the iron and forming
a basic insoluble sulphate, and the lime an insoluble carbonate,
with the carbonic acid of the water. But sulphuric acid is by
no means uniformly to be detected in the ochreous deposit
formed by the action of sea water on iron, nor indeed chlorine
either. But besides chlorides, sea water contains bromides and

iodides, and of the part which these play in the decompositions
consequent on the action of iron, it must be confessed we are as

yet wholly ignorant. Analogy, however, gives reason to pre
sume they play similar parts to the chlorides.
ACTION OF WATER ON IRON.  259

  If20. malleable iron or steel have been subjected to the sol

vency of sea water, carbon and sometimes silicon are deposited
in small quantities ; but when cast iron is acted on more re
markable results follow. After it has remained for a length of
time immersed, the metal is found wholly removed, and in its
place a pseudomorph of its original size remains, as first observed
by Priestley, consisting of a carbonaceous substance, analogous
to plumbago, mixed with oxides of iron, and which frequently,
but not invariably, possesses the property of heating or in
flaming spontaneously when exposed to air. There have been
unfortunately, as yet, but few cases of this remarkable change,
which requires the lapse of time to take place, carefully ob
served ; and it is as yet by no means clear how it is produced,
what is its precise composition, or to what is owing the rise in
its temperature on exposure to air.

   21. It is remarkable, that not cast iron alone is subject to

this change ; under circumstances but little understood as yet,
the purest malleable iron is alike converted into what we shall
for brevity call plumbago.

    Karsten mentions, that when iron, whether wrought or cast,
has been long exposed to water holding in solution alkaline or
earthy salts, it is at length dissolved ; that when hard bar iron
had remained some centuries in sea water it was altogether dis
solved, and a mass of carbonaceous matter remained, as though
it had been submitted to the prolonged action of a diluted acid.
This change, he says, is generally attributed to the decomposi
tion of the carbonic acid contained in the sea water; but it is
much more likely that, in the long run, the sulphates and chlo
rides contained in the sea water are decomposed likewise by
the iron.

    The writer possesses a portion of an ancient anchor taken up
in the port of Liverpool, the iron that remained of which was
of remarkable purity, and which was converted into plumbago
of unusual hardness and brilliancy to the depth of half an inch.
This plumbago did not heat on exposure. Its specific gravity is
1*773. Thisfactmilitatesagainst an observation made by Hatchet,
and repeated by Becquerel, that anchors and other objects of
forged iron sustain no alteration in sea water but oxidation,
from which we must suppose that the contact of iron and plum
bago in the cast iron produces a voltaic current, which accele
rates the action of the latter.

    Berzelius' opinion is, that the carbonic acid contained in the
water dissolves and removes the iron. He quotes an instance
of the guns of a vessel which had foundered off Carlscrona,
which, when taken up fifty years afterwards, were found nearly

    Hatchet examined a specimen of plumbago which remained

a little chloride of iron, and that it was composed of

   Dr. M'Culloch made several experiments upon the artificial
formation of this plumbago by the action of diluted acids ; he
found it bore in quantity no definite relation to the species of
cast iron from which it was obtained.

   Pig iron produced more than that cast into guns or shot ; of

the latter the blackest varieties, as might be expected, produced
the most.

   This author mentions a case of its production from the action
of London porter on iron, and also of the recovering of some of
the iron guns of the Armada off the coast of Mull, which be
came so hot on being weighed, that they could not be touched.
He found that the produce of plumbago from the blackest cast
iron, dissolved in dilute acetic acid, equalled the bulk of the
iron, and was not pulverulent, but coherent, so as to be cut
with a knife.

   In some cases the plumbago heated, and in some it did not;
in the latter he presumes oxygenation to have taken place du
ring solution.

   From his experiments Dr. M'Culloch drew the rather singu
lar conclusion, that the plumbago was the oxide of a peculiar
metal, the oxygenation of which produced the heating.

   Dr. Thompson, in commenting upon this paper, observes,
that M'Culloch appears ignorant of the existence of silicon in
cast iron, and of Daniell's experiments upon the subject.

   22. Mr. Daniell has given some interesting experiments on

this subject in a paper, on the structure of iron developed by

solution, in the Journal of the Royal Institution. In this, after
describing the formation of this plumbago by the action of di
lute acids, and its properties, he gives an analysis of the sub.

hotter, absorbing either the residue, after absorption of oxy

that the plumbaginous compound consists of carburet of iron

protoxides without separation from the carbon.

  23. Dr. William Henry has given, in Thomson's Annals for
January 1815, an interesting account of his examination of this
substance produced from cast iron in coal-pit shaft near New

of the chlorides, and instances their capability of removing the
iron from ink. He also adds case of conversion of cast iron

into plumbago by the action of steam and powdered charcoal
on it.

    24. Dr. Thomson gives in his Annals for 1817 case of like
change, produced, with unusual rapidity, by the action of sour
paste, or weavers'        "dressing" to cast-iron rollers.   The change
was so rapid as to        oblige the substitution of wood
                                                            for iron. It

is  not stated whether the rollers were heated by steam or

otherwise, or were at the atmospheric temperature. In the

iron of 3 inches broad by 1 inch thick, which formed protectors
to the copper of a vessel, to the amount of about T^5 of its sur
face, were, in a voyage of not quite five months, to Jamaica and
back, converted into plumbago to the depth of half an inch ; it
heated on being scraped and exposed to the air when the ship

first went into dock. Mr. Brande, in the Quarterly Journal,
vol. xii., describes an iron gun which had long lain            in water as
converted into plumbago to the depth of an inch.
                                                                I have also
been favoured by my friend, Mr. Firmston of Glasgow, with a
piece of similarly changed cast iron from the false keel of the
John Bull, East Indiaman. In four years this piece of 1^ inch
Iby 4 inches was completely altered through. Its specific gra

composition of this specimen, or that from the wrought iron
before alluded to.
   25. Mr. Pepys found cast iron similarly changed by the ac

Ition of pyroligneous acid (Gill's Tech. Rep., vol. iii.); and

have myself obtained specimens so produced by this acid in a
state of vapour. The same change is produced by the vapour
disengaged in the roasting of coffee ; and a curious case of simi
lar action of sherry wine on wrought iron and steel is to be

found in Thomson's Annals. It is also well known that the
cast-iron plates at first used in the interior of Coffey's Patent
Still, were rapidly converted into plumbago by the action of
the low wines and proof spirits. Much more lately cannon
shot have been found immersed in the sea, near the site of the
battle of La Hogue, converted to the depth of an inch into plum
bago, or, according to another statement, all through. The
battle of La Hogue took place in May 1 692 ; henee these shots
have lain in the sea for a period of about 145 years; it is pro

iron, plays during its solution.

   It is established that carbon exists in cast iron, steel, &c.
in two states : as graphite or crystallized carbon, disseminated
in its mass, giving it brilliancy of fracture, softness, porosity,
and fluidity in fusion ; and as a definite carburet, combined with
a portion of the iron chemically, and mixed mechanically with
the remainder.
   Now, in the decomposition of iron so circumstanced by air
and water, whether in presence of an acid or not, besides the
combination of oxygen furnished both by the air and water with
the metal, other reactions take place. Nitrogen and hydrogen
are both set free, but they may or may not be both evolved. The
nitrogen combines with part of the hydrogen to form ammonia,
which, according to circumstances, is evolved, or combines with
the oxides of iron produced.
   But it is probable, from the experiments of The'nard and
Despretz, that an azoturet of the undissolved metal may also be
formed. Iron at a higher temperature is unquestionably capable
of decomposing ammonia and combining with azote, so as to aug
ment its weight by 0'12. But in addition, as the combined car
bon is set free from the iron in a nascent state, it seizes upon
a portion of the evolved hydrogen, and forms a highly volatile
and odorous oily hydrocarbon, while some of the uncombined
or suspended graphite, also set free in a highly divided state,
combines with another portion    of the                            with oxy
gen, and produces an extractive  matter  --hyadproothgeemn eanodf  Berzelius,

and which differs little from ulmic acid in its reactions. This
latter deposits as a brown substance, soluble in alkalis, &c,
and combined with all the magnesia and silica dne to the
amount of their bases, which the iron may have contained, if
any. The volatile oily hydrocarbon is partly dissipated with the
hydrogen evolved, partly swims upon the surface of the fluid,
rendering it irridescent, and is partly held absorbed by the
porous mass of oxides, carbon, and ulmic acid resulting from
the whole reaction. Hence we see that the simple decomposi
      of  cast iron by air and water may give rise to
tion      result than the following formula indicates  no          less  com

I27. Now to the presence of these hydrocarbons conceive we
are to look for the phenomenon of the spontaneous heating of
                                 many cases of the production of
the plumbaginous matter,     so  appears to be owing to their fur
which have been adduced.
                             It
ther oxidation, on exposure to air, presenting a great surface to
absorption as existing in the porous mass of plumbago, and to
be a strict analogue of the cases of spontaneous combustion
produced by various fat oils, &c. exposed to air, in contact with

cotton, linen, &c. &c, or other carbonaceous bodies exposing
a large surface to absorption. The fact that cast iron, which

will produce spontaneously-heatingplumbago, when decomposed
by air and water, or by hydrochloric acid, when dissolved in
nitric acid, gives a plumbago which will not heat spontaneously,
favours this view of the subject; the nitric acid supplying the
oxygen in the first instance.
   This is at present but an hypothesis used in directing experi

ments now in progress to determine the ultimate constitution of
these hydrocarbonous compounds, which have not yet been ana
lyzed, or collected even in sufficient quantity to admit of ana
lysis by others, and to discover the nature of the changes which
they suffer in presence of air or oxygen.
28. The analogy of this substance with the carburets pro
duced by the destructive distillation of the iron salts of the or
ganic oxacids and cyanogene compounds, is obvious. These,
Berzelius is of opinion, are true carburets, while other chemists
conclude them to be mere mixtures of finely-divided carbon
Iwith the base of the salt.

       cannot, however, but coincide in the view of Boucharlat,
whose experiments lead him to believe them mixtures of car
Ifbon, with one or more definite carburets of iron whose pro
perties he has described. .      thus, they are analogous to the
conditions in which carbon exists in cast iron itself.

  29. It also bears a striking resemblance to the powders de
scribed by Messrs. Stodart and Faraday, as obtained by the so
lution of some of their alloys of steel in sulphuric and hydro
chloric acids : these were not acted on by water, but oxidated in
air, and burnt like pyrophorus when heated to 300° or 400°
Fahr., leaving protoxide of iron and the alloying metal. They
conclude, that during the action of the acid, hydrogen entered
into combination with the metal and charcoal, and formed an

inflammable compound, as they found these powders sometimes
burnt with flame. By the action of nitric acid on these powders

Ithey obtained some fulminating compounds.

joint action of charcoal and platina with heat, a boruret of pla

tina is formed, which, on subsequent digestion in nitric acid,
becomes powerfully explosive ; boron here apparently playing

the part of the carbon in Mr. Faraday's compounds.

   30. The inflammable powders produced by Magnus, by reduc
tion of the difficultly fusible metals by hydrogen, also connect
themselves with the subject. To complete our knowledge of all
these remarkable substances, with reference to the immediate
subject of this report, will need a careful and extensive series of

experiments.
31. There have been but few observations made as to the
variations in composition of cast and wrought iron as regards
their  acceleration or retardation of the action of
upon                                                 solvent agents
       it. It is not known at this moment with       certainty what

properties should be chosen, in either cast or wrought iron,
that its corrosion may be the least possible, under given cir
cumstances, when used in construction.

    32. Faraday found the alloys of most of the metals he tried
with steel much less acted on by moist air than steel unalloyed;
but he also discovered the remarkable circumstance, that a very
minute quantity of an alloying metal produced an increased ac
tion of sulphuric acid on steel, within certain limits
of platina greatly increased the action of the acid     ; thus,   T£w
                                                        on the   steel

with   whicli it  was  alloyed ;  with from ^5 to T^CT it was power
ful ;  with 10    per  cent, of
                                  platina there was a feeble action ;
with 50 per cent, of platina the action was the same as with
unalloyed steel ; and an alloy of 90 platina and 20 steel was not
touched by the acid. In these cases eveu acids of very weak
combining power, as oxalic, tartaric, and acetic, rapidly dis

solved the steel. Of three possible modes of accounting for
this suggested by Sir H. Davy, Mr. Faraday justly chooses
that which supposes the platina in part forming a definite alloy,
and the remainder diffused through the substance of the steel ;
thus forming an indefinite number of voltaic elements. On the
first action of the acid some of the particles of platina are de
nuded, and being strongly negative with respect to the rest of
the compound, aid its solution. Upon this ground the action of
the excess of platina, in reducing the action, is obviously de
pendent upon the whole alloy becoming definite again. Solu
tions of chloride of sodium did not act more rapidly on these

alloys than on steel alone.

  33. It has been long observed how little liable to tarnish or
rust native and meteoric iron arc, which contain often as much
as 9#5 per cent, of nickel, and variable proportions of chrome
and cobalt. The following tables embody perhaps the whole of

ever, that this gives us very defective information, as Faraday's
case of the platina alloy shows that mere difference in propor
tion may wholly change the properties of the alloy in this re
spect. An analogue to the peculiar action of the platina in this
case found in the epigene crystals of native oxide of iron,
which are generally auriferous, and have the form of the bisul-
phuret of iron, %vhos» decomposition the electric agency of the
noble metal seems to have facilitated, though present in such
minute quantity in an uncombined state.

   34. Dr. Faraday also found that the alloys of pure iron were

less acted on by moist air than those of steel. It also ex

ceedingly remarkable, that in respect of corrodibility, the alloys
of steel follow totally different order to those of wrought iron.
In the following table the first column shows the order of cor
rodibility of various alloys with steel, compared with steel alone,
commencing with the less corrodible and the second column

It is obvious that each of these must be considered, not as a

binary alloy, but as a ternary compound of two metals with
carbon, or of one metal with a carburet of iron. These tables
point out a wide field for experiment of great interest.

to enter its pores, and actually saturate the metal like sponge.

the internal part of the cast-iron cylinder. It was of             such

tenuity as to take fire and hum at a candle like tinder.           It is

here obvious that the iron and copper cylinders were heated
alike, but the latter expanded much more than the former, and
hence, on cooling, compressed the tin (still fluid, probably, about
the centre of the length of the cylinder, although cold at its
ends), and forced it out through the pores of the iron. The
limit of force here was only that of the cohesion of the copper

cylinder.

Iness, which formed, believe, part of a furnace for decomposi
tion of sea salt ; it contains throughout its mass a minute
quantity of chloride of sodium, and a great deal of sulphur.

as being produced in the Bristol Zinc Works ; and as alloys of
cast iron with arsenic, antimony, and lead have been formed.
These observations arc intended to show the importance of se
lecting close-grained cast irons for works designed to resist
longest the action of air and water.
39. Of the relative rates of corrosion of the various com
mercial "makes," or specimens of wrought and cast iron,
             anything is    known, and that of a
scarcely                     that the blackest cast  very general   cha
racter.      It is certain                            irons, viz.  those

which contain the largest quantity of uncombined carbon or
graphite in a mere state of mixture, are acted on by air and
water the most rapidly. This has probably partly an electro
chemical cause, and partly a mechanical one, from defects of

hardness, and open and porous grain. There can be little doubt
but that the suspended graphite in this kind of iron forms the
negative element of innumerable voltaic couples which aid the
process of oxidation.
The gray or mottled iron most used for castings of ma
chinery and engineering purposes in general, as containing a
\ \less quantity of uncombined carbon, and having a denser

structure, is less acted upon ; and the varieties of iron which
present scarcely any symptoms of a crystalline texture at all,
but still are grained or mottled, and can barely be touched by
the file, turned, or bored, are those which, while they are still
capable of being used for almost every purpose to which cast
iron is applicable, are the least susceptible of alteration or decay.
   40. The officers of the French artillery, amongst whom M.
Born has been most conspicuous, have made a number of expe
riments on this branch of our subject. They have found that
the corrosion of iron by air and water is greater in proportion
to the purity or goodness of the coke with which the iron is
made, and that it is altered less when made with charcoal than
with coke. In the former case, it is probable this arises from
the iron containing the largest dose of uncoinbined carbon or
graphite ; and in the latter, namely, in that made with charcoal,
it seems to arise from the less quantity of silicium contained in
this cast iron. Various careful analyses made by Berzelius,
Karsten, Berthier, and others, show that, while coke-made iron
contains from 0"025 to 0"045 of silicium, that made with char
coal only contains from 0"002 to 0-013 ; and it is certain that
the presence of silicium disposes iron to corrode, although in
dissolving in menstrua it may sometimes act as a mechanical
protector, covering it with a coat of silex.
   41. M. Born has also observed that iron cast in "dry sand,"

or "in loam" moulds faced with charcoal, oxidates much less
speedily than when cast in green sand; and that "chilled" cast
iron, or that cast in iron moulds, is the least  of  all
of this change. -- (Comptes Mendus, 1837.)                susceptible

42. Becquerel, in remarking upon these statements, observes,
that cannon which are cast of close gray iron, and in "dry sand,"
sustain little alteration further than a single coat of rust, or
browning like a gun-barrel, which seerns to suspend further
action. This he attributes to the charcoal facing of the mould;
and adds, that if it were possible to carburate the surfaces of ob
jects cast in iron in the operation of moulding, this alone would
preserve them from further oxidation. There appears, how
ever, here to be a serious mistake ; the presence of a carbona
ceous coat on the surface of cast iron, unless impervious to air
and water, cannot preserve it from rust, however uniformly
spread. That it should do so, would be at variance not only
with the observed facts, and with the circumstance that the coat
of plumbago formed by the action of sea-water on iron does not
preserve the remainder, but is at variance with an experiment
of Becquerel himself, in which he shows that the application of
a piece of common charcoal to the surface of iron in a solution
270                          BIGHTH REPORT 1838.

of sea salt and sub-carbonate of soda greatly promotes its
oxidation. Unless, then, it were impervious to the fluid agent,
it could never prevent the oxidation, however uniform.

44. "Chilled" cast iron, or that whose substance, to a greater
or less depth, has suffered an alteriition of crystalline arrange
ment by having been cast in a cold iron mould, is unquestionably
that which suffers least change, in a given time, in water
charged with air, whether fresh or salt ; and this from two di
stinct causes : first, from its greatly increased density and hard
ness ; and, secondly, from the fact that a very large portion of
uncombined carbon is pressed or squeezed out by the expansion
of the   cI ryhsatvaelsproefseirnotnedattothethemComheemnticoafl  consolidation.

of chilled cast iron, in which, by a little management, this phe
nomenon has been rendered very apparent. On these the sus
pended or uncombined carbon is seen exuded in the form of a
metalline dew, and adherent to the surface in drops of various

sizes.

These specimens are interesting in another point of view, as
affording decisive instances of the expansion of iron in con

Isolidating.

      have also in my possession a piece of an unusually dense and

white "chilled" iron, of large dimensions, whose entire substance
is filled with interspersed octahedral crystals of apparently
pure carbon. They are nearly all of equal size, the principal
axis of the crystal being about one twentieth of an inch in
length. They are hard enough to scratch quartz, and are ex
ceedingly obvious and striking from their dark colour, compared
with the iron in which they are imbedded, the grain of which
also is brilliant and highly crystalline.

46. It has been considered by most authors that "chilled" or
white cast iron contains less combined carbon than the black
or gray varieties ; this, however, appears to be a mistake ; yet
it is undoubtedly true that it does contain much less carbon or
graphite in a suspended or uncombined state, and that the latter

takes fire,  unless the     whole   be

{Ann. de Chim. vol. xiii. p. 110.)
47. By two remarkable properties may the whole of the
metals be divided into as many classes, namely, those which
pass from the fluid state of fusion instantaneously to the solid ;
and those which assume the latter state by passing through an
intermediate condition of pastiness.
   The former property is exemplified in all the metals which

crystallize best, as bismuth, zinc, arsenic, &c; and the latter in

potassium, sodium, iron, platina, &c. The power of being
welded is entirely due to this latter condition of intermediate
pastiness between fluidity and solidity, and hence it is properly
not confined merely to metals, for wax, tallow, resins, camphor,
caoutchouc, glass, and most vitrifactions, have strictly the

welding property.
   But it results from this that those bodies which can be
welded can scarcely ever be crystallized by fusion and slow
cooling, because that pasty and viscid condition they assume
before solidification forbids the freedom of motion to their

molecules, which is essential to their crystalline arrangement.

  But in "chilling" cast iron by sudden cooling, time is not
given it to assume the viscid or pasty state ; its particles are
compelled to pass per saltum from a liquid to a crystalline solid,
snd, e converso, by continued cementation at a temperature ap

proaching its fusing point, "chilled" cast iron may be brought
back again to the ordinary grain of common cast iron. By this

instantaneous change, the crystals of iron in forming, in obe
dience to the general law, reject and throw out the uncombined
carbon as heterogeneous, which itself also assumes the cry
272 KIGHTH REPORT 1838.

stalline form. We see here, also, the close analogy to the pheno
mena and properties of unannealed glass, that is, of silicates
which have been compelled suddenly to pass from the semi-fluid
state to that of solidity, without passing through the pasty con

dition. In these the crystalline arrangement is distinctly pro
duced, as Sir David Brewster has determined by the optical
examination of Prince Rupert's Drops, and yet these, by being
annealed, are brought back to the state of ordinary glass.
   48. Hence, then, the superior hardness and greater specific
gravity of chilled cast iron. But while it accrues, from the
chilling of cast iron, that it corrodes less rapidly, a singular
and in some cases disadvantageous circumstance occurs in the
manner of its corrosion, which needs further consideration, as it

may sometimes happen to be of much greater practical im
portance than any amount of mere decay of substance.
49. When a piece of cast iron moulded in sand is exposed to
corrosion, this takes place with somewhat variable, but yet with
very considerable uniformity over its entire exposed surface.
Not so, however, with chilled castings ; in these, each nucleus
of exudation of its uncombined carbon forms with the iron in its

immediate vicinity a voltaic couple ; and its results are, that,

in place of the uniform action as before, the largest portion of
the surface remains unchanged, and corrosion is nearly wholly
confined to these spots, as so many local centres of actiou. The
oxides of iron are formed as usual ; but, from the texture of the

casting, and its constitutional carbon being all in a state of
combination, little or no carbonaceous or plumbaginous matter
is produced ; hence, as the spots of carbon form, with the rest
of the casting, so many voltaic couples, the oxides formed are
rapidly transferred to these points, and gradually produce large
tubercular concretions, which, M. Pay en states, always consist
of (F  e O) + (F ea Oa + F                          owrehicthhusinacrotiufricseialolyf

time   contain crystals of  the   octohedral iron

   50. M. Payen has presented several memoirs to the Academy
of Sciences on the subject of these local actions on iron, and has
applied to their explanation the facts he had previously disco
vered, as to the effects of alkaline and saline solutions in retard
ing or accelerating the corrosive action of water on iron. The
                                                                   b--y
principal facts he has established  are the following,   as given
the Commission of the Institute,    in reporting on his  memoir.
"(Comptes Rendus, Feb. 1837, No. VI.)

      He has found solutions, containing an alkali and sea salt in
such proportions, that, in place of being at all preserved, iron

placed therein was rapidly attacked.

What is more remarkable in this mode of alteration is, that

all points of the surface of the metal are not equally attacked ;
the action commences where there are breaks of continuity, or
where foreign bodies are deposited, which constitute, by their
contact with the iron and the liquid, a voltaic couple : all the
      of the surface preserves    its metallic lustre.

     M. Payen has determined the proportions of sea salt and

sub-carbonate of soda which accelerate the formation of tuber

diluted with 75 times its volume of Seine water, produced,
in less than a minute, on cast and wrought iron, a commence

We see, then, that solutions which have a feeble alkaline re
action possess the property, in presence of air and sea salt, of
producing on cast and wrought iron, which they moisten, local
concretions which preserve the remainder of the surface from all
change ; and that these effects vary according to the proportion
of the different salts, breaks of continuity, and the foreign bodies

      It may be concluded      (they                                  the observed

facts, that whenever there is a want of homogeneity in cast-iron
pipes, which convey water slightly alkaline and saline, tubercles

will be formed at the points where heterogeneity exists. M.
Payen has studied the circumstances in which, as regards the
formation of tubercles, white cast iron produces the same effect
as gray or black;" having diluted one volume of a solution of
carbonate of soda and of chloride of sodium, saturated at a
temperature of 15° Cent., with from 100 to 200 volumes of
distilled water, he has found that all the solutions between

these limits produce on white cast iron oxidations evidently
more tubercular and better localized than on the other kinds of

cast iron. These last afford more points of easy attack, and
            more numerous tubercles, and      hence less distinct.
pro"duWcee  see, then, that white cast iron,  as being less oxidizable

by certain mineral waters, appears to merit the preference over
gray iron for water-pipes."
   The reporters further add,  " We   are     not obliged             to say that

the constitution and composition of the artificial tubercles are
the same as those of the pipes at Grenoble, which would tend to
prove that both depend on like causes."
   51. This local action, in many cases, is of small importance,

and indeed might be more advantageous than that deep removal
of metal which takes place in softer irons ; but in the case of
pipes or similar receptacles for the containing or conveying of
water, the accumulation of these tubercular excrescences gradu

ally chokes the passages at numberless places, and obliges the
removal of the whole conduit. Nor does this evil solely apply
to chilled cast iron ; all hard cast iron which has been rapidly
or unequally cooled is pro tanto liable to the same.

   52. M. Vicat, in the Comptes Rendus, vol. iii. 1836, p. 181,
gives an account of the formation of these tubercles on the pipes
which supply Grenoble with water, in which they had increased
to such an extent as seriously to reduce the delivery of water,
and engaged the attention of the authorities. He proposed as
a remedy the coating    mofiltlhime epteiprse,s--inisnidfeacwt,ittho  hydraulic mortar
                                                                      brush them over

inside with Roman cement. This mode would no doubt for a
time diminish corrosive action, but it is much to be feared that

it could have but little permanence when the current was rapid ;
and, should the water contain much earthy matter, the tendency

of this to deposit and adhere to the pipes must be fatally
increased.
53. The Academy appends a note to M. Vicat's communi
cation, in which an opinion is expressed, that the tubercles of
Grenoble have attained their largest size, and are stationary ;

and it is questioned, Will they always remain so ? It must be
                  that the               rate of increment of these must be a
obvious, indeed,                         not perceive anything to set a limit to
decreasing one ;  but I do
their accretion, except the stoppage of corrosive action.

   54. In the same volume of the Comptes Rendus, p. 462, a
letter is published, from M. Prunelle, stating a case in which
tubercles had formed in conduit pipes where the water passing
was found not to contain a trace of iron. He did not chemically
examine the tubercles, which were friable, and as large as eggs.
From this it would seem to be the author's view that these

masses originate from iron contained in the water ; that this,
however, is not the nature of their formation, has been already
shown, and is evidenced by the fact, that no tubercles are found
in any of the                                        waters of Grenoble except

55. The explanation of the phenomena of tubercular cor
rosion given by M. Payen and the reporters to the Academy,
seems to lose clearness in proving too much. Mere want of
homogeneity of structure or of surface is alone sufficient ground
to explain the results ; and that the peculiar preservative action

of alkaline solutions is not a necessary adjunct, I have lately
had an opportunity of proving. In experimenting on the action
of very dilute                                                 and cast iron
tially coated   whityhdrozcinhclo, riIc   acid,  on wrought   a time, local   par
                                         found   that, after                  con

cretions or tubercles were formed at the points of contact of the
zinc and iron ; thus the effect is produced indifferently in acid
and in alkaline solutions. And I have since found tubercles

formed in iron pipes at Curraghmore, the seat of the Marquis of
Waterford, by water, which appears free from alkaline or earthy
matter. The peculiar effect, too, is confined to chilled or un
equally-cooled cast iron, to mottled cast iron, and to damasked
wrought iron, or that of mixed constitution, and in all appears
to result from heterogeneity of composition ; it is therefore un
necessary to call in to the aid of the explanation the distinct
and curious phenomena of the preservative action of alkaline

solutions.

         A letter is found in         the Comptes Rendus
from Sir John Herschel, stating that the pipes supplying Cape
Town with water had become tubercular ; and that, at his re

commendation, the engineer, Mr. Chisholm, had remedied this
by coating the pipes internally with Roman cement. The
ancient pipes in the streets of Dublin are likewise much affected
in this way ; and some fragments of the tubercles, and a piece
of the cast iron, which is of the white variety, were presented
to the chemical section at Newcastle.

   58. Another method for preventing tubercular concretions

has been employed successfully by M. Juncker, at Huelgoat
mine, in France, viz. that of impregnating the cast iron of
which the pipes are made with linseed oil, rendered drying by
litharge, and caused to penetrate the pores of the iron by great
pI rehsasvuerem. adeT,hiass  fact is  confirmatory of a preceding observation
                             to the   permeability of cast iron to many sub

stances, and seems to offer a new field of investigation, as u
method of protecting cast iron from the action of corroding
agents. We know that it has been long usefully applied to
other hard and crystallized substances, as stone, marble, &c.
59. Another method, wholly mechanical, is described in the
Mining Review as in nse in Cornwall for the preservation of
iron pipes, and must be eminently useful in many cases.
Each length of pipe is lined with a thin tube of wood, con
sisting of staves of pine, of equal length with the pipe, driven
in from the end, and to which the iron pipe forms, as it were,
one elongated hoop. The pine staves are driven in when very

dry. On being wet, they expand, and force themselves up so
close to the interior of the pipe, and at their joints, that the
whole cast-iron pipe becomes staunchly lined with a casing of
wood, which cuts off all communication with the corroding

agents.
60. The difference in the rate of action of air and water, but
still more of acids, on different specimens of cast iron, contain

hardest kinds of malleable iron generally appear to oxidize
slowest, but this is not universally true, as Swedish iron is acted
on by air and water with great rapidity.

Steel appears less corrodible than any variety of wrought iron ;
but of none of these is there any precise knowledge on our sub
ject, or that approaches numerical results, which alone are of
practical use in directing the engineer, or indeed the physicien.
Neither is our actual knowledge more advanced as to the variable
effects of corrosive action on the same iron, of different waters,

clear water, strongly saline, or merely brackish, calcareous, al
kaline, or chalybeate, holding much or little carbonic acid, acts
most powerfully in producing rust, that is, produces the largest
quantity in a given time from any one specimen, or in what re
lative degree. This statement is made exclusively, of course, of
the better-understood cases of mine-waters, such as solutions of

sulphate of copper, &c, whose action on iron belongs to another
branch of our subject.
64. There are some cases of local action on wrought iron,
however, which appear remarkable, and need investigation.
The very purest and finest specimens of wrought iron, when ex
         with turned or bored              surfaces, to fresh water, frequently
posed,     entirely locally, by
corrode                                    deep and destructive pitting. A

         of a turned wrought iron valve was presented, acted on
finortthioisn way, in about two months, by a remarkably pure stream
of fresh water, holding nothing but air and a trace of carbonate
of lime and iron in solution. This sort of reaction appears the
converse of M. Payen's tubercles, and its explanation would
seem to lie in the iron so affected possessing a damasked
structure, that is, in fact, being composed of two sorts of iron
chemically different, and united by welding. This is unavoidably
the case with all "scrapped" wrought iron, or that forged or
rolled from scraps of various sorts. Now these differently-con
stituted irons, being in different electrical relations, give rise to
a voltaic circuit, in which the most positive is corroded fastest ;
but as all the surface is in some degree affected, the oxides
formed cannot adhere, and hence, while pitting goes on in some
places, tubercles are formed in none. This view suggests the
importance of having large bars, which require to be formed
    trhoellisnagmseev"ermalaksem,"alliefr   ones together, formed from   iron all
by                                         for any important purpose as  regards
of

durability.
  It shows     that rolled bars,                  being more uniform, are pre
              the same reason,             toas"  scrapped" or hammered iron j

and it points out that the practice adopted in some cases of
making railway bars by rolling together two bars of different
sorts of iron, the one hard and rigid, to give a durable upper or
working face to the bar, and the other tough and soft, to resist
                                                   the duration of
extension, is highly objectionable as regards     -- eminently so,       the

cause the lower segment of the rail, viz. the extended part, will
corrode the fastest, thus losing strength where it is most wanted.

wrought iron found at the bottom of a very deep well in a

20 feet of water for nearly eleven years.

   The bar lay approximately due north and south, horizontally.
When taken up it was found powerfully magnetic, with polarity;
and though the bar was throughout equally exposed, corrosion
had alone taken place at its two extremities. The ends were
injudiciously cut off, by which its magnetism was almost de
            This   curious subject needs further elucidation.    It is
stroyed.           authentic instance has yet been given in
doubtful   if any                                              which

magnetism appeared directly to play a chemical part. And the
question is one of considerable importance as regards our sub
ject ; for, as it is well known that bars of iron, by long standing
in the vertical or certain
                             other  positions, acquire magnetic pro
perties ; if it should be   found   that magnetic polarity exercises
any direct effect upon chemical agencies, then it may result
that the duration of a structure in iron may in some degree de
pend upon the position of its parts with respect to the magnetic
poles of the earth.
Long since, Professor Maschmann, of Christiana, published
some curious experiments, which were confirmed by Hansteen,
on the effects of a magnet on the crystallization of the Arbor
Dianre, in a U-shaped tube of glass, beneath or above which it
                  (Quarterly Journal  obf yScsioemncee,Brviotils. hxvcihi.emp.ist1s58a.)t
was   placed.
      results,  however, were denied
His

the time.
66. Since that time, the investigation of this influence, which

has been repeatedly asserted and denied, has been undertaken in
a very careful and particular manner by Professor Erdmann.
He first points out the number of delicate perturbing causes
which may, and have occasionally led to mistakes, pointing out

and magnets which he had occasion to use were very powerful,
some of them competent to lift 80 pounds.

         In experiments on the reduction of metals by the humid
process, as in the Arbor Dianae, no influence of terrestrial mag

both branches of the syphon tube, and without reference to
their direction.

of a ver)' large magnet, its poles proved not to have the slightest
power over the formation or disposition of the crystal within.

placed over the poles of magnets, with every care that their
power as conductors of heat should not interfere. The mag

" Insulation, or free communication with the substance of

acquired by the iron placed vertically ; and, to try if in fact it

Ihad any influence on the decomposition of the salt, plunged,
in this position (viz. vertically), a bar of soft iron in a tube of
glass containing a neutral solution of sulphate of copper, and

Icorked it. As scarcely any disengagement of gas agitated the

liquid, saw that decomposition began towards the two ex

tremities of the bar, advancing progressively towards its middle
point ; the two extremities and this point acting meanwhile on
a magnetic needle, as the two poles and the neutral point of a
magnet, and the poles changing by reversal in the usual manner.
The effect of this magnetization appeared then to augment che
mical action, and hence to diminish the quantity of copper de
posited on the platina."
Are we to conclude from this that magnetism modifies che
mical action, or that chemical action is capable, under certain
conditions, of conferring magnetism on iron ?
The subject is obviously in need of much further experiment,
Itand is one of interest in a general, as also in our particular view.
   68. will be now necessary to state the nature and extent of
the experiments upon the large scale which have been instituted
at the desire of the Association, and aided by its funds. On the
very first consideration, it appeared important that those expe
riments in which time was an element should be first of all put
m progress ; and of these the most important seemed to be,
1st. To obtain experimentally a set of numerical results of
      the relative rates of corrosion of all the different most im
      portant makes of British cast iron, exposed under the same
      circumstances to sea water, and unprotected, except from
      mechanical abrasion ; and a like set for fresh water, va
      rying the conditions in both cases as far as might occur in

      practice.
With this view complete sets of authenticated specimens of
      iron from most of the principal   iron-works in Britain have
cast                                   very considerable delay ne
been   written for and obtained. A

about two months since that it was found practicable to com

specimens.

   These specimens were then all fused, at the works with
which the writer is connected, separately in crucibles, to avoid

change of composition by contact with the fuel, and cast in
green-sand moulds into the form of parallelopipeds, of 5 inches

Jby 5 inches x 1 inch thick, and of 5 inches by 5 inches x
inch thick, respectively ; and at the same time a bar of 1 inch
square and 12 inches long was cast of each description of iron.
The whole of these specimens, whose surfaces are as nearly
equal as possible, were then weighed each to a single grain, or
within about 55,555 of the weight of the piece, and                                        in the
external frame of the box (fig. 1, as shown in Plate                             inclosed  No. .

                                                                                 XVII.),
This box is so contrived as to permit free access of air and sea
water at all sides, and while the specimens of iron are held fast
at four of their angles, they are freely exposed to the action of
these agents ; but each in a separate cell, for a reason to be here
after mentioned. As any mode of numbering these specimens

would be inadmissible, if not impracticable, they arc to be re
cognised when reexamined solely by their place in the box.
The series commences at A. fig. 1, and reads from left to right,
going upwards, as more particularly described in the notes at
tached to the tables. No iron used in the construction of the

box enters its interior, and the specimens, with the frame in
which they are arranged, can be lifted out at any time for in
spection, without disturbance of their position or touching their
surfaces. This box, like the others to be described, is of stout
oak kyanized, which, although the researches of Lassaigne upon
this subject, showing that the combination of albumine and bi
chloride of mercury is soluble in alkaline chlorides, renders it
probably of less service in sea water, yet is not likely to inter
fere in any way with the results of these experiments.

the same temperature, (the crucibles having been heated in
draught furnaces,) and all permitted to cool at the same rate.

bis structures, and enabling us, by analysis of the least and
most corrodible, to see on what these properties depend. Hot
and cold blast iron are included in this box, and also specimens
of the same cast iron chilled, and cast in loam, dry sand and
green sand, cooled rapidly and slowly, and some with protected
surfaces, (not electro-chemically protected however,) as will be
again alluded to. This box was sunk and moored in Kings
town harbour in 3 4 fathom water, at half tide, at the second
mooring buoy in from the western pier head, at one o'clock, on
the 3rd of August (1838), on a bottom of clean sharp sand;

temperature of the water, 58° Fahr. It is proposed being
weighed and examined once every six months if possible, and

at the expiration of a year the specimens weighed accurately
and again put down, and so weighed year by year for at least
four years. By this, not only the actual amount, but the rate
of progress of corrosion on every specimen will be determined.

   71. The object of casting the inch-square bars 12 in. long, of
each sort of iron, at the same time with those exposed to the
sea and fresh water, is in order to have specimens, comparable
in all respects with these as to constitution and texture, whose
specific gravities have been, or are in progress of being, taken,
and whose chemical or physical properties can be in future de
termined, should the progress of the experiments on the exposed

pieces render Buch desirable.
    There is the utmost variability of structure and composition

amongst these specimens, as will be observed by referring to
the column of observations in the table, but can only be fully
perceived by inspection of the castings, when fresh broken.
As an accurate knowledge of the specific gravities of these spe
cimens was of some importance in several respects, and chiefly
as being a check upon the weighings, and upon the soundness
and dimension of the rectangular pieces of iron, submitted to
experiment, some pains were taken in arriving at the best and
most expeditious mode of proceeding.

   The common mode of taking the specific gravity of solids by
weighing in air, and then suspending from a silk fibre or hair in
water, is subject to many inconveniences and sources of error,
as the variable quantity of the suspending thread wetted and
 immersed, its capillarity and the resistance of the fluid to free
vibration of the beam, &c. &c, a modification was therefore
 adopted of the plan of weighing the solid in air and immersed
 in a given volume of water, which is weighed along with it.

    But as the cast irons, if broken into fragments sufficiently
 small to go into a common specific-gravity bottle, would be
 likely to involve air bubbles hard to be extricated, each speci

cube was weighed in air at a temperature
glass cylinder was provided capable of being closed air tight at
its open end by a circular disk of thin Bohemian plate glass,
equal in diameter to its exterior. The size of the cylinder was
such as just to admit, without contact at the angles, a cube of
the above size, and its weight with the plate-glass cover, was
under 100 grains when empty. Its weight was then accurately
determined from the mean of a number of weighings, when
quite full of distilled water, free from air, at 60° Fahr. The
filling is easily accomplished by pouring in the water after
having been boiled in vacuo and cooled, until its surface rose a
little above the          or top  of the cylinder,, and then  sliding on
the glass plate.  edAge  number    of the iron cubes having   now been

weighed in air were thrown into a considerable volume of di
stilled water at 60°, and placed under the exhausted receiver
of the air pump, and agitated until all air bubbles had escaped.
The glass cylinder being filled as before, each cube was taken
out of the water by forceps and placed in the cylinder, from
which it of course expelled its own bulk of water ; the cylinder
was now closed, dried rapidly in bibulous paper with gloved
hands, and weighed, the temperature of the apartment being
preserved carefully at 60° Fahr.

   It is sufficiently obvious from these data that we get the spe
cific gravity from the formula
                                     ^,
                         S        =   w

--where S is the specific gravity of cast iron, iv -- the weight of
a cube of distilled water =0*75 of an inch, A = the specific gra

vity of water, and W the weight of the cube of cast iron,
equal in volume to the cube of water.
This method possesses several advantages in rapidity and ease
of execution, and in precision of result, besides involving a check
upon any serious error of experiment in every instance ; for as
each cube is weighed in air, and the weight of a cubic inch of
distilled water at 60° Fahr. is well determined, the specific gra
vity of each cube is at once known within the limit of error in
the gauged dimensions to which the cast iron cube is filed.
There was found to be no difficulty in drying the outside of the
cylinder, so that it did not change its weight in the balance, i. e.
perfectly, and no sensible evaporation took place from under
the plate-glass disk, after remaining in the balance for forty-
eight hours.

I have entered rather at length upon the mode of taking these
specific gravities, because the method in its details will be found
useful in other researches, as in taking the specific gravity of
small mineral specimens, &c, and because the precise determi
nation of the maximum and minimum specific gravity of cast and
wrought iron is of importance to the iron founder and engineer,
as giving the data upon which the weight of castings are esti
mated, and which, as usually stated by authors, are an unsafe
guide, inasmuch as the specific gravity of cast iron varies with
its composition, the way in which it is cast, the rate of its cool
ing, and the depth of the mould, to an extent not generally
kno72w.n.I was favoured by my friend Mr. William Fairbairn, of
Manchester, with a few specimens of the same hot and cold-

blast irons, on which he and Mr. E. Hodgkinson experimented
as to their cohesion, so that not only the physical properties of
these will be known from the experiments of these gentlemen,
but their durability from the present.
   73. Some specimens of Irish iron from the Arigna works,

county Leitrim, are also included, and some experiments, made
by Messrs. Bramah, of London, upon its strength are given, on
the authority of the agent of the works, as an appendix to the

will not be deemed irrelevant.
74. Four other similar boxes have been prepared, which all
contain a selection of specimens coordinating with those in
No. 1. The second box, No. 2, is sunk and moored in the

foul and putrid sea water at the mouth of the Kingstown town
sewer, where it debouches into the sea.
The water here is 2 feet deep at ebb, and from 8 to 12 feet at
flood tide, and a constant succession of bubbles of sulphuretted
hydrogen and marsh gas pass through it from the deep deposit
of mud which forms the bottom.

   75. The box, No. 3, containing a similar set of specimens
with No. 2, has been deposited, by permission of the Dublin
and Kingstown Railway Company, in the hot-water cistern of

their baths at Salt Hill, in clear sea water, maintained con
stantly at a temperature varying from 110° to 125° Fahr. The
object of this experiment is to determine the change of cor
rosive action produced by increased temperature in sea water
containing but little combined air, and the differences of this
action on various kinds of iron.
   76. Van Beek and Dr. John Davy appear to be of opinion,
that sea water, after it has been boiled, is incapable of decom
posing iron from containing no air ; at the temperature of 125°
Fahr. decomposition is however most rapid, as the action of the
sea water on the iron cisterns of these baths demonstrate ; and

yet the water contains little air at that temperature.
   The results of my own experiments also show me, that after

all the air is expelled that can be from sea water by boiling, it
is still capable, at its boiling temperature, of decomposing iron,
and that with a rapidity as great as at ordinary temperatures,
however highly charged with air. In addition to which, there
is no longer any reason to doubt the fact, that under such cir
cumstances the alkaline chlorides are in part decomposed by
the iron as well as the other salts contained in sea water.
   77- Indeed Scoresby's experiments appear to prove that it is
impossible to deprive water, whether salt or fresh, of all its air,
by any amount of even alternate boiling and freezing. He found
that, on boiling briskly some sea water in a phial, and then
corking the latter and exposing it to cold, as the water froze
air bubbles began to appeac moving upwards in the fluid, and
the ice produced was full of microscopic air bubbles. Hence
he concludes it probable, either that water is not entirely freed
from air by boiling, or that some of the water is decomposed
during the progress of the freezing process : of the latter there
is no likelihood.
Boussingault also states that he found 16 per cent, of oxy

                                                 It is to be remarked, however,

that, as has been observed to be the case with lead and some

other metals, so iron seems to be corroded much more rapidly
by air and distilled water at a high temperature, than by water
holding any alkaline or earthy salts in solution. The destruc
tive effects of a small leakage of steam producing a trickle of
distilled water to steam boilers have often been observed by

engineers.
78. The experiments of Dr. Faraday on the order of deposi

tion by boiling of the saline contents of sea water, and the re
spective temperatures at which each salt deposits, showing that
they fall in the order of their respective insolubilities, indicate
that important differences in the corrosive action of sea water,
when boiling, may result from its degree of saline concentra
tion, and to this, the resulting boiling point, the electro-con
ducting power of the fluid, as well as the nature of the salts
deposited and remaining in solution, are conditions. And, fur
ther, as means have been devised (although with increased ex
penditure of fuel) of preserving sea water in marine steam
boilers, (or others using salt water,) at a constant degree of sa
turation, it becomes important to discover when this is such as
to produce a minimum corrosion, whether before or after the
deposition of the sulphate lime, or of the chloride, sodium or

magnesium.
79. The next box, No. 4, has been moored by permission and
assistance of the Ballast Corporation of the port of Dublin, in
the foulest water of the river Liffey, in the mid stream, opposite
the mouth of          the Poddle    river,  at this place a tributary of cor
rupted water.                       water   4 feet deep at ebb, and from 15
                        It lies in
to 20 feet at flood tides. The water is very brackish at full
tide, and at the other periods fresh ; its temperature, when the
box was sunk, was 61° Fahr. The specimens in this are the
same as in Nos. 2 and 3, as may be seen by the tables. Its ob
ject will be to determine the relative effects of foul river water,
alternately brackish and fresh, and this will again compare with
the results to be obtained from the last box, No. 5.

   80. It has been sunk in the clear, unpolluted fresh water of
the Liffey above Island-bridge, and within the premises of the

Royal Military Hospital. It lies in water varying at times from
3 feet to 6 feet in depth ; its temperature varies with the season.
   Specimens of water have been taken from these five localities
for examination, and will be again taken and examined from
time to time. The highest and lowest temperatures of each
will also be observed.
   81. In each of these boxes have been included a number of
                      coated with various

                                             by a fact of importance commu
nicated to the writer by Thomas Rhodes, Esq., civil engineer,
whose experience in the construction of great works in iron is
well known. He mentioned, that when engaged on the locks
of the Caledonian canal, certain cast-iron sluices were put down
and exposed to the ocean water, having been coated over with
common Swedish tar, with the exception of their faces,
which were ground together, and were removed in about four
288 EIGHTH REPORT-- 1838.

years afterwards : every part of the iron still covered with the
tar was found sound and untouched as when put down ; but the
ground faces, which had not been tarred, were softened and con
verted into plumbago to the depth of £ of an inch.

   This interesting and important observation shows that, where
abrasion does not interfere, if we could get any coating to ad
here to the iron which would be impervious to air and water,
the preservation of the metal would be effected in the best and
simplest manner. Unfortunately, many difficulties oppose this,
and few, if any, varnishes can be obtained which will spread
over the iron without leaving uncovered spaces or microscopic

pores.
   Professor Lampadius long ago directed his attention to this

point, and, in the Annates des Arts et Manufactures, published
the composition of a paint or varnish for the preservation of
iron from rust, the basis of which is sulphate of lead and sul

phate of zinc ground with plumbago and oil. It is difficult,
however, to see the precise point aimed at by this composition.
82. The paints and varnishes which have been placed in pro
cess of experiment in the above five various conditions are seve
ral of those most ordinarily in use, with the view, that as no
thing certain is known upon this branch of the subject, the fate
of these coverings, many of whose other properties are well
known, may afford leading indications as to the direction in

which improvement may be sought.
83. As yet it has been impossible to arrange any experiments
upon a large scale upon wrought iron, nor indeed to collect suf
ficient specimens j but there has been included in each of those
five boxes a single parallelopiped, all of equal size, and cut from
the same bar ; it is of what is called common Welsh bar iron,
or No.

precisely similar to the rest of the specimens,

take the action of the sea and fresh water upon as unity, and
refer their action upon all the other specimens to this, by which
means not only will this whole series of present and projected
experiments on wrought and cast irons be numerically compa
rable most conveniently by the engineer, but any future experi
menters upon novel makes of iron, or upon foreign ones, can,
by reference to the standard bar in possession of the Associa
tion, make their experiments comparable with these.
ACTION OF WATER ON IRON.  289

   Without this precaution the present experiments, although
correct, would stand isolated, and be scarcely capable of being
even brought into comparison with future ones. Nor could it
be hereafter determined what change as to corrodibility, future,
and now perhaps unthought of, revolutions in the manufacture
of iron may produce in the metal to be made in years yet to
come.

   84. The writer's experiments also lead to the expectation,
that with the same bar of iron, or the same casting, a simple and
closely approximate estimate may be formed of its destructi-
bility in water or in solutions of the alkaline or earthy chlorides ;
by the rate of its solution in other agents ; and with this view
experiments are in progress upon the standard bar and other
iron, and in the event of their results being found as here stated,
it is obvious that upon the basis of the present prolonged ex
periments in sea water, the durability, under similar circum
stances, of all other or future irons may be determined in a few
hours by the aid of this new method of examination.

    85. The subject now leads us to consider briefly the various
modes of protection which have been proposed for the purpose
of preventing, as far as possible, those actions of water and air
on iron, the rate and nature of which our experiments have been
directed to determine ; and these, with the exception of mere
superficial coverings, as already alluded to, have all been of the
electro-chemical class, and more or less directly derived from
Sir Humphry Davy's original discovery and proposal of the

protection of the copper sheathing of vessels. In that paper the

great principle was developed of counteracting chemical by
electrical forces ; his successors have only, with greater or less
perfection, developed and applied his brilliant idea to particular
cases, while in doing so, it must be confessed, they have cor
rected some small errors into which this great philosopher fell.

In Sir H. Davy's original papers on the preservation of copper

sheathing, he distinctly states, that it follows from his principles
then developed, that cast or wrought iron may be preserved
from chemical action by suitable protectors of zinc or tin.

   But my friend Professor Edmund Davy has unquestionably
the merit of having been the first to conduct a series of well-
devised and careful experiments upon the subject on the large
scale, which he did partly in connexion with the preservation
of the iron work of the mooring chains and buoys in Kingstown
harbour, under the auspices of the Board of Public Works.
The results of these have been already communicated by him to
the Association, at its meeting in Dublin, and published in its
reports.
290 EIGHTH REPORT 1838.

The results of these investigations show that zinc is fully ca
pable of protecting cast or wrought iron in sea or fresh water,
when applied in a massive form, at least for a time. They also
put in a forcible point of view the important part which the
contact of air plays in the corrosion of iron.

   86. It would seem, however, to be doubtful how far this pro
tecting power even of zinc is completely permanent, for as a
portion of the oxide of zinc is transferred to the surface of the
iron, as Professor Edmund Davy has observed, it would seem
      the preserving power of the zinc is  diminished.

Miller, of Cambridge, to the curious fact, that the surface of the
iron covered in places with microscopic crystals of calc spar;
these he was kind enough to examine for me with the gonio
meter, and although under very disadvantageous circumstances,
succeeded in verifying their form as that of the common calc
spar rhomb. This fact interesting, as a new instance of the
production of an insoluble crystallized mineral by galvanic curis

rents of low tension.

   87. Pepys long since proposed to preserve polished instru
ments of iron and steel from rust in air by zinc protectors. This
seems to have been unsuccessful, and was found to be so by
Professor Edmund Davy.
   88. Very lately company has arisen in London, under the
name of the "British Galvanization of Metals Company," based

this, that, as was to be expected, the zinc preserved the iron, in
dilute acids, until the whole of was dissolved. In the sped

mens furnished us, the iron, which is all wrought, (and its ap
plication to the more carbonaceous cast irons must be more
difficult,) is zincked or, if the expression may be used, tinned
with zinc ; the coating is excessively thin, and from its peculiar
greasy feel, leads to the presumption that it has been slightly

Iamalgamated also.

   89. was enabled to detach from one spot a few grains of
zinc, which, on                                            to be as pure as it is
usually found in         ecoxmammienraceti.on,I  appeared  to have found it alloyed

with lead ; of this it contains a trace, and a good deal of iron,
probably taken up in part from the bar. No mercury could be
detected in it.

  90. A very few minutes are sufficient to dissolve off the whole
of the zinc from the surface of the iron when immersed in hy
drochloric acid, diluted with 40 volumes of water.
   91. Oxide of zinc is rapidly deposited in sea water or a solu
tion of common salt, when acting on it.
92. When a bar of the zincked iron is placed in hydrochloric
acid, diluted with 20 volumes of water, the zinc having been
completely removed by the file from one half of its surface, hy
drogen is given off both from the zinc and iron surfaces from
the first moment ; and after the whole of the zinc is dissolved,

this gas is much more copiously evolved from the surface that
had been zincked, than from that from which it was filed off.
This circumstance appears to be connected with the strength of
the acid ; it does not occur in that which is very dilute.
93. There can be no doubt of the power of this combination
to protect iron for a time, or while the thin coat of zinc lasts
perhaps, and in some practical points of view it would seem to
offer advantages over zinc protectors, as proposed being ap
plied by Edmund Davy. But it seems to be forgotten by the
advocates of this attenuated application of the preserving metal,
that for every particle of iron protected, an equivalent of zinc
must be destroyed, and that hence, unless a sufficient mass of
the electro-positive metal is provided to allow for degradation,
its 9e4f.ficaItcyismnuostt  soon be null.
                            intended, however,   to pronounce any decisive

opinion as to the advantages or disadvantages of this peculiar
mode of applying zinc protectors until we have had time to make
other and careful experiments upon it;                     meanwhile, in  justice

the arrogation of original discovery to M. Sorel, the patentee
of this                      which some          of the French scientific journals
make.    pIrtocdeosess,     seem strange         how any pretension to originality

publications of Sir H. Davy, Pepys, and Edmund Davy ; and still
more, how a French patent is to be maintained for a process
which, although its principle was doubtless then not under
stood, was, with little variation, before patented on the 26th of
September, 1791> by Madame Leroi de Jaucourt, for preserving

the method of zincking over the surface of iron as a preserver
so far back as 1834.

  95. M. Sorel's patent is described as capable of being ap
plied in three ways, viz. 1st, by covering the surface with fluid
zinc; 2nd, by the application of a paint made from zinc; 3rd,
by covering with a powder made from zinc. Unless the second
mean a paint made from ground metallic zinc, it is similar to

Lapadius' varnish, before described ; and if the former, then it
does not differ from the third mode described, apparently. We
have, however, not been furnished with specimens of either of
these modes, which would seem beforehand not likely to answer
their intended purpose, from a want of that continuity of me
tallic connexion which appears essential to preservation in this

way.

   96. Sir H. Davy erroneously supposed that tin also possessed
the property of preserving iron in sea water. This opinion has
been controverted by the experiments of M. Van Beek, of Utrecht,
and of M. Mulder, of Rotterdam, and more recently by Profes
sor E. Davy, in a paper communicated to this Association, in
which he shows that iron, on the contrary, will preserve tin, but
that zinc will preserve both.

   Sir H. Davy, and his brother Dr. John Davy, who has
defended his opinion, appear both to have been led astray by

merely considering and experimenting upon the galvanometri-

cal relations of tin to iron ivhen first placed in contact. But
Van Beek, in the paper alluded to [Edin. New Phil. Journal
for October 1837.) has cleared this up by the discovery of the
remarkable and anomalous fact, that although it is certain that
tin is to iron in a positive relation in atmospheric air, yet when
both are plunged into sea water, after a period, never greater
than half an hour, has elapsed, the astatic needles of the galva
nometer, which had before indicated the above relation, gradu
ally return to zero, and pass through it to the opposite side,
and indicate that the iron has become positive with respect to
the tin, thus showing the singular fact apparently, that metals
retain for a longer or shorter time the electrical condition they
have once acquired.

   97. By decisive and direct experiments also, M. Mulder, of

                                           A plate of iron
was placed in a glass vessel containing one litre (= 6] -028 cub.
in.) of sea water, during 20 days, at the temperature of the
month of November 1836 (at Rotterdam namely). After the
experiment the weight of the iron was found to be = 32726
grains, loss by oxidation = 0"181 grain.

  2nd. A similar plate of iron, exactly of the same weight of
32-907 grains, but on whose surface was fixed a small piece of
tin weighing 8-140 grains, was in the same manner exposed for
20 days in one litre of sea water : the weight of the iron, after
the experiment, was found to be = 32-674, that of the tin
8- 139 grains; hence loss by oxidation of the iron = 0-233
grain, and loss by oxidation of the tin = 0001 grain. These
results show that the iron, when exposed to sea water as above,
alone lost by oxidation 0-052 grain less than when in contact
with the tin.
Van Beek, in recording these experiments, observes, that the
action on the tin must have taken place at the first moment of

   99. We have now to consider the subject of communication
made at the last meeting of this Association, at Liverpool, by

Mr. John B. Hartley of that town, upon the power of brass to
preserve cast and wrought iron in sea water. Mr. Hartley

reported to have stated in the Chemical Section, that certain
iron sluices having brass in connexion with some of their parts,
had on examination been found perfectly sound and uncorroded
in the neighbourhood of the brass, after an exposure of twenty-
five years, but were corroded elsewhere and that in couse-
quence of this discovery, all the iron work below the tidal level
employed in the Liverpool Docks had been placed in connexion

  vol. vii. 1838.

with brass in some way, and that its preservation had fol
lowed.

    100. The statement created considerable discussion and atten -
tion at the time, and at first seemed to Professor Davy and myself
an important element in the subject of investigation with which
we had been entrusted by the Association. Accordingly, very

soon after the meeting, Professor Davy addressed Mr. Hartley

upon the subject, detailing the results of his previous experi
ments, and expressing his conviction of the non-protective pow
er of brass to iron, and assigning another and sufficient cause
wholly unconnected with electro-chemical protection to the phe

nomena described by Mr. Hartley. A copy of his letter is an

nexed, as published in Saunders' News-letter of Oct. 24, 18.17-

          "To John B. Hartley, Esq., Liverpool.

" You will I am sure excuse the liberty I take in addressing
you, on an interesting and important subject on which you have

regret that the state of my health prevented me from taking an
active part in the proceedings of the Chemical Section at the

of my experience, that brass will not protect cast or wrought

on the contrary, these metals will protect brass from corrosion

                                     there is little difficulty in accounting for

iron is stated to be 'an iron pin working in a brass socket,
which was again inclosed in an iron case ; all the iron in con
nexion with the brass was in excellent preservation, whilst that

"removed from it was corroded.'

      Now it seems clear to me that the preservation of the iron,
under the circumstances here enumerated, was an effect due to

the mere condition in which the metal was placed, which was
such as precluded (almost entirely) the access of air, on which
its corrosion, both    in salt and fresh water, depends.                                                                         Under

the common brass of commerce ; but on learning that its com

position was different, he instituted experiments with Mr. Hart

Robert Mallet. On trying the effects of this brass on iron in
salt water, it had no more protecting power than the glass ves
sel in which the experiments were made. When the two metals
were in close contact, the iron preserved its original brightness,
as was also the case where the iron was in contact with the

bottom of the glass vessel ; but all the other exposed surfaces

of the iron were corroded just as readily as if common brass
were used with the iron."

   We hence were precluded from any information or assistance
from Mr. Hartley, and were about giving up all hope of expe
rimenting on the identical brass stated to have been used at
Liverpool for protection, when we were unexpectedly favoured
by Professor Kane with a piece of this brass weighing about
two pounds, which he stated had been personally handed to him
by Mr. Jesse Hartley ; with these the following selection of
experiments made by the writer, from amongst many others
made by Professor Davy and himself, may be stated with their
results.

    103. When a piece of cast iron was placed in a glass vessel
of sea water with a piece of this brass laid in close contact with
its upper side, the iron was rapidly attacked, the brass remain
ing bright, and rust soon deposited in large quantity.

cast iron, and exposed in similar circumstances to sea water
alone, was much less acted upon by it.

   105. Two pieces of wrought iron similarly treated produced
similar results.

    106. Specimens of cast iron and of wrought iron similarly
treated, with and without the presence of the brass, produced
similar results, as above, hi fresh water, but more slowly.

    107. Where the surfaces of the brass and iron were in close
contact, the iron remained nearly bright ; but it did so likewise
when a piece of plate-glass was substituted for the brass, or
ACTION OF WATER ON IRON.  299

when wood, mica, paper, or another piece of the same iron took
its place.

    108. The larger was the proportion of the brass present to
the quantity of iron exposed, the faster the latter corroded.

    109. When the brass was attached by solder to the iron,
whether cast or wrought, the action was the same, with in
creased energy, provided the solder (composed of lead and tin)
was not immersed in the fluid. When it was, so the results
were anomalous, corrosion being retarded at first, and after
wards accelerated, apparently from a change of electric relation
between the metals, as in Van Beck's experiments before
noticed.

    110. When a cylinder of brass, in composition the same as

Mr. Hartley's, was cast round a turned cylinder of wrought iron

at its fusing temperature, the iron on exposure to sea water was
rapidly acted upon, and carbonates of lime and magnesia were
deposited upon the brass, which remained bright.

    111. Corrosion in all cases commenced at the moment of
immersion, and continued without change for periods of nearly
two months.

    112. When cast or wrought iron was exposed to sea water or
fresh in the same vessel with a surface of this brass, but without
contact, but each communicating by a gold-soldered platina wire
outside the fluid, corrosion took place of the iron more rapidly
than when similar pieces were exposed without the presence of

the brass.

    113. No modification of alloy in the brass within the limits
of brass or gun metal seemed to produce any very remarkable
change in the increased rate of corrosion of iron by its presence,
nor did the results differ materially whether brass proper, viz.
zinc and copper, were used, or Mr. Hartley's brass, which is,
in fact, impure gun metal, or copper and tin.

    1 14. As the proportion of zinc, however, in the brass in

creased, a tendency to preservation should be manifested, and
conversely as the copper predominated, increased corrosion

would be expected. This view has suggested a very curious
branch of investigation now in progress, as to the changes of
electrical relations to a third metal of definite atomic alloys of
two other metals, whereof one is in a positive, and the other in
a negative electrical relation to the former.

    115. These results are sufficient to prove incontestably, that
brass or gun metal have no protective power over iron what
ever, but, on the contrary, greatly promote its corrosion in sea
or fresh water, and, as we also found, in diluted acids.

    116. But as practical instances often come more home to the

the Dublin Docks of cast iron deeply acted on and corroded in
a period of eighteen years, though in close contact with brass.
This is a portion of a sluice, situated                                         and low
                                         between high

and lately obliged to be removed and replaced with a new one,
in company with several others, from the deep corrosion and
softening it had undergone.
The brass was here a facing riveted to the cast-iron sluice all
round, to make it water tight. The composition of this brass
differs from Mr. Hartley's only in containing some more zinc,
of which his contains but a very small quantity, which by ana
logy and according to Mr. Hartley's own view is all in its fa
vour. Here, then, is an experiment of eighteen years' duration,
which results in showing that brass has had no protective power
in the tidal water of the River Liffey.

   117- It appeared worth while to make a quantitative analysis
of Mr. Hartley's brass and of this from the Dublin Docks, both
for the purpose of comparison, and to see if they were atomic
compounds or mere accidental mixtures with approximations to

It is hence obvious that all these brasses are chance mixtures,

and that the Dublin Dock brass contains the most zinc, and
comes nearest to atomic constitution; and hence might have

fectually preserved the iron it was in contact with. It is still
more remarkable, however, how great the discrepancy in consti
tution of the two specimens of Liverpool brass is, the latter
containing an enormous proportion of lead.

   121. It is not difficult to imagine that the mistake of Mr.
Hartley has arisen from neglect in observing that which Pro
fessor E. Davy has first pointed out, namely, that iron, or other
metals, in its relation to water are preserved from corrosion by

appear to be a case of slow or retarded chemical action by the
opposition of capillary forces of the same class as slow action,

   122. Indeed, Mr. Hartley be reported rightly, he stated
to have mentioned that "soil," mud suppose, lay on the sluices
said to have been preserved, and which had to be removed prior
to their examination               there little wonder                     should
                       ;      so,                                    they

take, may have been the supposed preservative surfaces being
often smeared with oil or grease, which, for considerable time,

And Dumas has proposed the employment of caoutchouc in so

found useless after short period.
   125. During the experiments already detailed seemed just
possible that Mr. Hartley's might be yet concealed case of
Professor Schoenbein's anomaly of passive iron, or of Dr. An
drew's inactive bismuth, and the writer was just about com
mencing some experiments with view of elucidating this, when

he received the Bibliotheque Universelle, published in February

last, containing an article by Professor Schoenbein on the very
subject. In this he shows, as indeed he had previously done in a
letter to Dr. Faraday in the Lond. & Edinb. Philosophical Maga
zine for December last, that he, Schoenbein, "had already demon
strated, 1st. That iron only comports itself passively as the anode
in relation to the oxygen disengaged by the current in aqueous
solutions, which  &cocn;ta2innda.loTnheaotxtyhgeenstiazteedocfocmhpeomuincdasl ,inads ioffxearecindcse,

of iron can only be obtained with respect to oxygen ; and, 3rd.
That this metal acts in its ordinary way when it is plunged as an
anode into aqueous solutions of the hydracids of the chlorides,
bromides, iodides, fluorides, or sulphurets ; in fact, in solutions
of combinations whose negative element has a great affinity to
iron. In these cases the oxygen resulting from the electro-che
mical decomposition of the water combines with the iron in the
same way as  Htheenccehl,o"ricnoentoinr uieosdiSncehodeinsbeenigna, ge"d
cumstances.                                                               as  under like cir

which are in solution in sea water are for the most part electro
lytes which do not contain oxygen as a constituent, it is impos
sible, after the facts above stated, that iron as an anode can be
indifferent chemically, in relation to sea water ; but, on the con
trary, this metal must combine with the oxygen, chlorine, &c.
disengaged by the current."
Schoenbein then states the result of an experiment he made
directly with sea water, by plunging an iron wire connected with
                             it,

                                                                         ;

                                                             it
                                                                                             ;
the positive pole of a pile into thereby closing the circuit no
oxygen was evolved at the iron, which was oxidized, in strict
accordance with his general principle. He then proceeds to
show, that assuming Mr. Hartley's view to be right, involves
an initial absurdity or contradiction in principle and finally
concludes, that the observation of Mr. Hartley must be con
sidered as doubly anomalous, namely, in relation to common
and acknowledged electro-chemical laws, and also to those spe
cial ones developed by himself.
    126. The anomaly, however, may now be considered simply
as an error, but one of very serious character, apparently from

        is127. To recur again for moment to the subject of the boxes

of specimens of cast iron sunk for experiment, was stated
that they were divided into separate cells for each kind of iron
by veneers of varnished oak. The reason of this arrangement,
and deduction which has grown out of and likely to prove
important as affording mode of protecting cast and wrought

iron, remain to be stated. It having been early remarked that

the harder irons, whether cast or wrought, were acted on much
more slowly than the softer and more carbonaceous ones,
appeared not impossible that several different sorts were in
closed in electrical continuity in the same box, grave errors
might be introduced into our results by the iron least acted on
standing in negative relation to those more rapidly corroded,
and increasing the action of the sea or other water upon them,aa
and at the same time being themselves preserved to certain
                               a

of any two different irons, the harder was always in negative
relation to the softer, which was positive to      and hence the

separation of every specimen became necessary in order to eli

it oscillated about 2° ; but when one half of each of the two
original pieces, i e. the black and the gray, were immersed, the
needles deviated at once from 78° to 80°, and on adding a single

drop of hydrochloric acid, flew round.
    131. This action in common water or sea water always showed
the softer iron positive to the other, and continued constant and
unchanged in an experiment continued for some days.
    132. When two pieces of cast iron, such as the above, were
immersed in dilute hydrochloric acid, tied together and in con
tact, the harder one remained quite bright and untouched be
fore and after the acid was saturated, while the softer was rapidly
blackened and dissolved ; neither was any gas evolved from the
negative piece, unless the acid was concentrated.
133. The subject is not in a state to do more now than state
the principle in view, and that so far as experiments have yet
gone, it is likely to add a new if not a better mode of protecting
iron to those already known ; if successful, its application to
engineering structures will afford many facilities of execution,
and be attended with much greater economy than any process
in which zinc is used possibly can.

   134. It already suggests to the engineer the importance of
preserving uniformity of texture and of chemical composition
in all parts of  his structures of  iron, in order  that one
not accelerate    the destruction   of the other.              part  may
                                                     It also  shows   the

necessity, when wrought iron (which is negative to all but chilled
cast iron) is applied in contact with cast iron, of allowing extra
substance in the latter to meet the increased corrosion produced
by the wrought iron at the points of contact, and it explains
why the vital injury is so often sustained in works in cast iron
of this metal being first eaten away round the bolt holes, as for
instance, in the air-pumps and condensers of marine engines,
where the parts of the work are secured together ; and it further
suggests, that where the sides of these bolt holes in the cast
iron can be chilled or cast on an iron core, as is often practica
ble in such cases, while the bolt will slightly suffer, the cast

iron round it will be preserved. On a future occasion I hope

to lay the results of this branch of the investigation before the
Association.
135. M. Payen's observations as to the power of alkaline
waters to protect iron from rust, though seldom applicable, are
worthy of   further
rationale.           investigation, and an attempt to  discover their
             It has  very long been known that lime    in powder, or

limewater, possesses a decided power of this sort, and both are
in use amongst workmen.
Cases may be found in practice where solutions of an alkali
306                    EIGHTH REPORT 1838.

or alkaline earth would be admissible and valuable if found
effective preservers of iron ; for instance, lime-water might
readily replace the bilge-water in steamers, whose action is at
present so destructive to the holding-down bolts, blow-off pipes

and cocks, boiler bottoms, coal bunkers, &c, and to the de

composition of which in a great degree the peculiarly offensive
smell of the bilge- water of steamers is owing. There is no rea
son to assume that dilute lime-water would have any injurious
action on the timbers of the ship.
   136. Dr. Andrews' and Schcenbein's experiments, however,
in which a metal becomes capable of rendering passive or of
protecting in certain cases another, although itself not acted
on, give hope that protectors of this kind may yet be found and
practically applied to iron ; and hence it is in this direction that
our efforts should be bent with most energy in seeking to pre
serve metals from oxidation, namely, to obtain a mode of elec

tro-chemical protection, such that, while the metal shall be
preserved, the protector shall not be chemically acted on, and

Iwhose protection shall be invariable.

When the gold and iron wires were placed in communication

Thus, when the iron in contact with the alkaline water, the
                          a is
metal takes by degrees charge of negative electricity, and the
water charge of positive electricity, as there had been a
chemical reaction between them. (De la Rive in fact considers
that     due to chemical action, though excessively slow.)

These two electricities, notwithstanding their reciprocal attrac
tion, remain in equilibrium at the surface of contact, which they
are not able to break, and they only rccoinbine when we esta
blish the communication between the iron and the solution by
means of a wire of gold or platina. Hence it results that the
iron rendered constantly negative is found in the least favoura
ble state for combining with the oxygen of the air present in
the solution.
   It is unnecessary here to pursue

    138. The subject, of which I have thus given I fear a very
imperfect sketch, is a wide and important one, and many care
ful experiments are wanting to complete our knowledge of it.
The following especially are desiderata immediately applicable
to  the                     and  also to the chemist.
    1st.  eAngisneereier s   of  experiments to determine

gression of corrosion in sea water and fresh, at increasing
depths, from 0 to say 10 fathoms.

                                                                                     by M.

Biot to
    4th. A set of comparative experiments on the action of sea
water, diluted with various known proportions of fresh, as at
the mouths of tidal rivers.
    5th. Experiments are wanting as to the effects of the pre
sence of animal matters in a state of putrid fermentation in sea
and river water, in modifying their action on iron, as in rivers,
&c. receiving the sewerage of cities.
    6th. Determinations of the amount and nature of the plum
bago produced from various makes of iron, its precise compo
sition, and the conditions of its heating or not spontaneously,
with the results of this action.

  A careful repetition of many of the experiments on the action
of pure water, and of air and water on iron, is also needed, the
results of former experiments being neither satisfactory nor
uniform.
    A paper of some novelty on this subject has just appeared in
308      EIGHTH REPORT 1838.

the Bibliotheque Universelle for June and July, 1838, by Profes
sor Bonsdorf of Helsingfors. In this the author studies in ge
neral the action of various metals on air and water, under the
following conditions : --

   1st. In air perfectly dry and free from carbonic acid.
   2nd. In air saturated with vapour of water, but free from
         carbonic acid.
3rd. In air containing both the latter.
4th. In contact with liquid water and air, both free from, and
         also containing carbonic acid.
He states that in the first condition no metal oxidates but po
tassium and sodium. That in the second case no metal oxidates

but arsenic and lead ; in particular, that zinc, iron, and bismuth

do not oxidate, and that a gentle heat increases the action on
the first two. The author also brings forward some new views
on the subject of the deposit of moisture on metallic surfaces in
certain conditions, which, however, do not seem quite correct.
7th. Experiments would also be desirable as to whether mag
netism affects the rate or form of corrosion of iron, and hence,

whether position as to meridian has any thing to do with the
durability of engineering works in iron.
8th. Experiments upon the suitability of various protecting
paints and varnishes, and the modes of their application to works
exposed to air and moisture, would be very valuable, giving pre
ference to those which, with other obvious properties, dry soon
est after rain, and, under given circumstances, cause the least
deposit of dew. Upon this point Bonsdorf 's paper above alluded
to may   be consulted.
   9th.                  set of experiments would be useful also
         A comparative
showing, under like circumstances, the effect of corrosion of sea
water, and of its mechanical abrasion by this fluid in motion, or
of the difference of action on iron in still sea water and in a tide

way.

   10th. It would be exceedingly important also, as an element
of this investigation, as well as useful to the mechanic, to obtain

a correct measure of the resistance to abrasion of various makes

of iron. This has been attempted by Mr. Fairbairn, unsuccess
fully, by means of grinding on a stone a piece of weighed iron,
of given surface and under a given pressure, for a known time,
and noting the loss of weight. The most likely means of ar
riving at this will probably be by making wheels of the various

irons to be tried, turned on the face and fitted on to steel axles,
suspending these in a swinging frame, and causing them to re
volve for a length of time against the faces of other turned

wheels, all of one sort of iron, say tyred with No. I Welsh bar

The loss of weight sustained by the wheels would then indicate
their respective ratios of abrasion, the loose axles being, pre
viously to weighing, taken out so as to eliminate their wear from
that of the face of the wheel.
This method and the probability of its giving correct results
have been suggested to me by the uniformity with which the
wheels of railway carriages wear when tyred with the same iron.
Railway experience also shows that the resistance to abrasion
in rails of wrought iron is to that of cast iron as 15:4.

   Since the foregoing report was sent to press it has been con
sidered unnecessary to print the tables of experiments on the
great scale referred to therein at length in this volume, in as
much as at present they necessarily consist more of data than
of results, the latter demanding                       the lapse of          time for their col
lection. It has been therefore                         determined            at present merely
to give a synoptic view of those tables of experiments in

progress.

The original object of these experiments has been to try how
far it is possible to form many mineral substances which we
either have not formed in the laboratory, or which have only
hitherto been produced by the dry method.
Many circumstances concur with the few scattered experi
ments which have been made on this subject in causing us to
suppose that this may frequently be effected by the long-con
tinued action of boiling water or steam, or both, on the consti
tuents of the mineral to be formed.
These may be presented to the action of these agents either
in a nascent state, as in silex and earths, or oxides recently pre
cipitated, without    bceoinnsgtitdurtieedaangdivemnixemdinienratlheifactoommicbinperdo;poor r

the mineral may be formed by the mutual decomposition and
recombination of other bodies, more or less difficultly soluble
in boiling water. Attention has been directed to both methods,
and indications are                            to give hopes of success in
                                not wanting    some time known, that chal

temperature upon gelatinized
it can be equally well formed      by the decomposition of certain
kinds of glass by the same means as remarked by the late Dr.
Turner. Indeed, the extreme facility with which almost every
kind of glass decomposes, under the continued action of boil
ing water, has greatly retarded these experiments. None has
been found to answer the purpose but the hard Bohemian

             glass ;
The minerals as yet chosen for experiment have been chiefly
hydrates, of which the following may serve as a type; the
production of these has been attempted by direct combination
of their constituents with excess of water.

Various uniaxal and biaxal micas, and some metallic sulphurets
and sulpho-salts, have also been attempted by way of double

decomposition.
The substances to be tried, when mixed and covered with
water, are sealed in Bohemian glass tubes, numbered and ex
posed to steam in a box between two low-pressure boilers, in
one or the other of which steam is always up.
Specimens of peat, of lignin, of coal, and other analogous
organic bodies, have also been exposed in various ways, in the
expectation that some light may be thrown upon the formation
of coal and bitumens ; and various supposed insoluble crystal
lized native minerals have also been exposed immersed in boiling

water, in order to determine what its action, if any, may be on
their crystals, and what effect may result from the dissolved mat
ter. Various woods have been placed in contact with gelatinized
silex and its solutions, in the hope of slowly forming silieifica-
tions similar to those from Antigua, &c.
These experiments, it is conceived, will connect themselves
in a very interesting point of view with those in progress under
Mr. Vernon Harcourt's superintendence upon the action of a
much higher but indefinite temperature upon mineral bodies.
There is every probability that very many of the minerals in
the crust of the earth, especially the crystallized ones, have
been formed at a comparatively low temperature. Quartz is

Malachite has been found in a similar state. Vauquelin found

one containing a liquid with a piece of coal floating in it ; and
Mr. Haig found hard crystals of quartz in a bottle of Saratoga
water, which had stood many years,    (Quart. Jour. xv.). The

basalt, serpentine, greenstone, mica, and many other minerals

discovered by Mr. Knox (Phil. Jour.), and of fire damp in the
vesicles of sal gem by Dumas ; all these indicate the compa
rative low temperature at which the formation of many mine
rals has probably proceeded.
Coal too has been found in Scotland converted into plumbago
by the proximity of a dyke, yet at such a distance that its com
municated heat must have been extremely low. On the other
hand, facts are not wanting to indicate the powerful effects of
water and a moderate heat in decomposing and changing or
ganic or organized bodies, as, for instance, the changes re
marked by Perkins in the oil of his high-pressure steam engine,
and very many similar known to the organic chemist.

of Al6 + Mg, or colourless spinell, as remarked by Chenevix.
   These scattered facts are sufficient to show that the experi
ments here indicated, while they belong to chemistry and mi
neralogy, abound in interest to the geologist. The experiments
have not been sufficiently long in operation to yield definite re
sults.

   Mr. Baily reported that the reduction of the stars intended to
form the enlarged Catalogue of the Royal Astronomical Society
was in progress ; that a small portion only of the original sum

the sum appropriated had at present been expended ; but that
about half the amount would be required.

the Secretary of the Bureau des Longitudes for the corrected
copy of the Histoire Celeste gratuitously offered by that Board
for the use of the computers ; but that he had not yet received
any answer to such applications.

several two-necked bottles filled with liquids fitted to combine
with and detain the gases sought, as lime-water for carbonic
acid, &c. The same gasometer registers the quantity of air
thus deprived of the accidental and variable gas, while the
quantity of gas separated is found by calculation from the pre

Ireport was printed, should on every account have rejoiced to
Ihave embodied it in the report : and am anxious to avail my
self of this opportunity of doing what may yet be done to sup
ply the omission. Captain Duperrey 's observations were made
with a horizontal needle, which, from accidental circumstances,
was not observed with prior to his departure from France.
The usual test of the permanency of the magnetism of the
needle, viz. its vibration at the same station, at the commence
ment and at the close of the series, was, therefore, omitted in
this case. In the absence of this, which is the most conclusive
test, Captain Duperrey has estimated the loss which his needle
       VARIATIONS OF THE MAGNETIC INTENSITY.                               319

may have sustained, by comparing its rate of vibration at Paris
on his return, with its rate at a station in Peru, in the line of
no dip, in which comparison he has assumed the relation of the
force at that station to the force at Paris to be as 1 to 1*3483.
The loss of magnetism sustained by the needle on this estima
tion was altogether inconsiderable. The times of vibration at
four other stations at which this needle was employed, cor
rected for temperature and arc, give the following values of
the total intensity.

great care, and with every necessary precaution. These re

  I may take this opportunity also of adverting to the observa

tions of Professor Bache and other gentlemen of the United
States, which were not included in my report. These obser
vations were made at New York, and in the adjoining states ;
and Mr. Bache is now engaged in connecting them with Eu
rope, and, consequently, with the general body of the intensity
observations. Until this comparison is complete, which it will
not be until Mr. Bache returns to the United States, the ob

servations referred to serve to determine the value of the mag
netic force at the stations at which they are made, relatively to
each other, but not relatively to other parts of the globe ; and
they were not, therefore, available for my report. The Ame
rican observations were made with magnetic needles inclosed
in a vacuum apparatus, which Mr. Bache had devised, with the
view of avoiding some of the anomalies occasionally experienced
by other observers. They were made with extreme care, and
were remarkable for minute attention to all those circumstances
which conduce to the accuracy of the results.

On a General Geometric Method. By Charles Graves, F.T.C.D.

Mr. Graves was led to the views he was about to explain, from ob

serving the use  in   the  "doHcitsrtioniere    de la Geom6trie,"   viz.,  theorem given
by M. Chasles,        his                                                   that "the en

M. Chasles, to mean the ratio of Sin. (a, d), Sin. (b, e) to Sin. (a, o)
Sin. (c, d); a, b, c, andrf, being right lines diverging from the same point.
He insisted on the importance of M. Chasles's theorem, as a kind of
geometrical characteristic of the conic sections, defining them like an
equation ; and showed how it might be advantageously applied in the
determination of loci, and also in the invention, proof, and generaliza
tion of theorems relating to the conic sections. In ascertaining whether
the plane curve described by a point, subject to a certain condition, is
a curve of the second degree or not, the general method that suggests
        is,                         positions of                                 draw from

monic relation of these four lines be invariable, the curve will be
conic section, and not otherwise. Among several exemplifications of
this method, Mr. Graves discussed the problem of finding the locus of

the centres of all the conic sections passing through four given points.
The middle points of the sides of the quadrilateral, at whose angles are

the given points, being evidently situated on the locus, was sufficient
to show that the enharmonic relation of lines drawn from them to any

other point in it was constant; and this follows immediately from a
theorem announced by Mr. Graves, viz., that "the enJiarmonic relation
of four diameters  of a central conic section, is the same as that of their
four conjugates."   In order to connect this mode of investigation with
the ordinary algebraic method, Mr. Graves formed the equation of a
conic section passing through the four points (x1, o), (--x", o), (p,y')t
(o,--y"), (the axes of the co-ordinates being made to pass through the
points,) and finding only the co-efficient of xy to remain indeterminate,
he establishes the following equation between this co-efficient B, and (r)
the enharmonic relation of four lines drawn from any point in the locus

to the four given  points,  r  =  xx-f''~vy",'++x"xy'W"----+  B-.  From this Mr. Graves

deduced some elegant consequences, and pointed out the readiness with
which M. Chasles's theorem serves to group together, and to prove
other very general ones ; such, for instance, as that of Pascal, relating
to irregular hexagons, inscribed in conic sections, of which it furnishes
by far the shortest and most elegant proof yet obtained. He concluded
with the expression of a wish, that mathematicians would not disdain
to employ the resources of geometry combined with analytic methods
in the treatment of conic sections, many valuable properties of which
have been lost sight of by those who seem to consider the study use
ful only as- an exercise in the application of algebra to geometry.

But, in order that this law may agree with the phenomena, it is es

of the distances between them.     For if we suppose     rf(r)  =                            r  ~ 3, and
                  == r~3,f (r) =  -- 3 r -- *, we shall

and by extending the summation to particles, distant by several times
the length of an undulation from the particle which they are supposed
to attract, these sums (13.) become extremely large, and the terms of
                  diverge very rapidly at first, though they    always finish
the series (11.)
by converging.     In fact, if we conceive a sphere, whose      radius = n X

the combined effect of the actions of all the particles within this sphere,
we may, as a good approximation, convert each sum (13.) into a triple
definite integral, and thus obtain, for the general term of the series

But -- expresses the time of oscillation of any one vibrating particle ;

this time would therefore be nearly constant, if the particles attracted
each other according to the law of the inverse square of the distance ;
and consequently this law is inadmissible, as being incompatible with
the law of dispersion. It had appeared to Sir William Hamilton im
portant to reproduce these results, though he remarked that they
agree substantially with those of Cauchy, because the law of the in

verse square was one which naturally offered itself to the mind, and
had, in fact, been proposed by at least one mathematician of high
talent. There was, however, another law which had great claims on
the attention of mathematicians, as having been proposed by Cauchy
to represent the phenomena of the propagation of the light in vacuo,
namely, the law of a repulsive action, proportional inversely to the

fourth power, or to the square of the square of the distance. M.

Cauchy had, indeed, supposed that this law might hold good only for
small distances, but in examining into its admissibility, it appeared
fair to treat it as extending to all the neighbouring particles which act
on any one. But against this law also, Sir William Hamilton brought
forward objections, which were founded partly on algebraical, and
partly on numerical calculations, and which appeared to him decisive.

    The spirit of these objections consisted in showing that the law in
question would give too great a preponderance to the effect of the
immediately adjacent particles, and would thereby produce irregu
larities which are not observed to exist. In particular, if it be supposed
that

            S.r'Ax* = S.r'Ajf8= S.r'Az*,
            S.r' Ax* = S.r< Ay* = S.r* Az*,

On the Propagation  ofHLaigmhitltoinn,  Crystals.  By Prof. Sir W. R.

                                         F.R.S.

   By continuing to modify the analysis of M. Cauchy in the manner
already explained, he had succeeded in deducing, more satisfactorily
than had in his opinion been done before, from dynamical principles,
a large and important class of the phenomena of light in crystals ;
though much still remained to be done before it could be said that a
perfect theory of light was obtained. He had employed, for the pur
poses of calculation, the supposition that the arrangement of the parti
cles of the ether in a crystal differs from an exactly cubical arrangement
only by very small displacements, caused by the action of the particles of
the crystalline body ; and had attended only to those indirect or reflex
effects of the latter particles which are owing to the disturbances which
they produce in the arrangement of the former particles : but he did
not mean to assert that he had established any strong physical pro
bability for this being the true modus operartdi in crystals, though
he thought the hypothesis had explained so much already that it de
served to be still further developed.

On  some  Points  connected with the    Theory     of Light.                    By Professor

                              Powell,   F.R.S.

   At the last meeting, the author dwelt on the importance of extending

observations on the refractive indices for the standard rays to more
highly dispersive media. In prosecuting these inquiries, he has to re
               TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTION'S.                                          7

port that a prism of cliromate of lead, owing to the nature of the sub
stance, will not enable him to determine the indices, as the whole spec
trum is confused, no lines visible, and the violet end totally absorbed.

    In the identification of certain of the standard rays of Fraunhofer

some discrepancy appeared to exist between different representations.
The author's attention is now directed to this point, among others
connected with a more accurate repetition of his former approximate
determinations of refractive indices, on which he is now engaged.

    He wishes also to draw attention to questions connected with the
application of photometry to the theory ; especially to that referring to
the power of the eye to judge of the equalization of lights, and the in
fluence which the illumination of one space has upon that of another in
juxtaposition. To show how great the uncertainty is, the following
very simple experiment may be referred to. On receiving the rays of
a candle on a white screen, and intercepting a portion of them by a
clear plate of glass, the eye can recognise no difference in the illumi
nation of the covered part. Yet, from both the first and second sur
faces of the glass, there is a copious reflection.

    With regard to the mathematical theory, he alludes to the important
researches of Mr. Tovey, especially those on elliptic polarization. All
the preceding investigations for integrating the differential equations for
waves, including the dispersion, have proceeded on the supposition that
certain terms vanish. This appears essential to the general solution.

Mr. Tovey has, however, shown, that if those terms do not vanish, we

have still a particular solution : and this applies to the case of light
elliptically polarized. This case is absolutely excluded in the former
investigations, which are therefore imperfect. The author has endea
voured to clear up some points connected with this inquiry. Upon the
evanescence or non-evanescence of these terms simply depends the el
liptic, circular, or rectilinear character of the vibrations. Corresponding
to these mathematical conditions, are those of the arrangement of the
aetherial molecules in the medium, or part of the medium, where the
polarization is communicated. He has pointed out the connexion be
tween these views and the investigations of Prof. Maccullagh, in which
that gentleman connects with certain equations of hiotion the elliptic
polarization in quartz, by which Mr. Airy had explained the results
and laws of M. Biot.

object could be seen in any other direction than that of a line perpen
dicular to the curvature of the retina, at the point where it is really ex
cited. He then proceeds to investigate mathematically how the ap
parent magnitudes of objects would be affected, on the two suppositions,
that the line of visible direction coincided with the refracted ray, or

with a line perpendicular to the retina, at the point where the refracted
ray fell upon it. On the first supposition, he finds that the apparent
magnitude of small objects would be increased about 1-- 13th or l-16th,
if the anterior surface of the crystalline is supposed to have a radius of
six lines in place of four. On the second supposition, namely, that
of Porterfield and Reid, he finds that the apparent magnitude of objects
would be increased nearly one-third, which, as he remarks, being con

which are not placed in the optic axis ? This is a point which it ap
pears very difficult to determine exactly and rigorously. However, as
experience proves that objects of small extent, which are within the
range of our eyes, do not appear sensibly greater than they are in
reality, it follows, that the visible point, which sends a ray to the cornea,
is seen sensibly in its place, and, consequently, this visible point is seen

D'Alembert has deduced the preceding results. He takes for granted
the dimensions of the eye as given by Petit and Jurin ; and he assumes
Jurin's Index of Refraction for the human crystalline lens, though it is
almost exactly the same as that of an ox, as given by Hawksbee. These,
indeed, were the best data he could procure; but he should have inquired

if the most probable law of visible direction was compatible with any
other dimensions of the eye, and any other refractive powers of the hu
mours, which were within the limits of probability; and, above all, he
ought to have examined experimentally the truth of his fundamental
assumption, that visible points are really seen in their true places when
                         in the  axis of vision. In submitting this assumption to
tehxepyeriamreentn, otI  had no  difficulty in ascertaining that there exists an ocular

parallax, and that this parallax is the measure of the deviation of the
visible from the real direction of objects. It is nothing in the axis of
the eye, and increases as the visible point is more and more distant from
that axis ; and hence it follows, that during the motion of the eye, when
the head is immoveable, visible objects do not appear absolutely fixed,
and have an apparent magnitude greater than their real magnitude.
We are, consequently, not entitled to reject any law of visible direction,
on the ground of its giving a position to visible points, and a magnitude

upon which D'Alembert reasoned. According to the anatomy of the
eye which he adopted, the centre of curvature of the retina, which he

supposes to be spherical, (as he does the eye-ball,) is equidistant from
the extremity of the axis, or the foramen ovale, and the centre of the
crystalline lens. This, however, is far from being the case. M. Dutour,

M. Maurice, a recent and able writer on vision, and, which is of more
consequence, Dr. Thomas Young, have all made the centre of curva
ture of the retina, at the bottom of the eye, coincident with the centre
of the spherical surface of the cornea ; and this centre, in place of being
almost half way between the apex of the posterior surface of the lens

results conformable with those of Dr. Young ; and almost all these
authors regard the human eye as a spheroid. When we add to these
considerations the fact that the refractive power of the crystalline lens
assumed by D'Alembert is nearly triple of what it really is, we have no
scruple in concluding that the results of his calculations are inadmissible.

Assuming, then, the most correct anatomy of the eye, namely, that
according to which the cornea and the bottom of the retina have the

same centre of curvature, it is very clear that if there was no crystalline
lens, pencils incident perpendicularly upon the cornea will pass through
this common centre, and fall perpendicularly upon the retina. Hence,
in this case, the line of visible direction will coincide with the line of
real direction, and also with the incident and refracted ray, and will
likewise pass through the centre of curvature of the retina. Now, the
refractions at the surfaces of the crystalline are exceedingly small, and

at moderate inclinations to the axis the deviations from the preceding
law are very minute. At an inclination of 30°, a line perpendicular to
the point of impression on the retina passes through the common centre
already referred to, and does not deviate from the line of real visible
direction more than half a degree, a quantity too small to interfere with

the purposes of vision. At greater inclinations to the axis of the eye,
the deviation of course increases ; but as there is no such thing as di
stinct vision out of the axis, and as the indistinctness increases with the
inclination of the incident ray, it is impossible to ascertain by ordinary
observation that such a deviation exists. Hence, the mechanical prin
Ifciple of D'Alembert, and the law of Dr. R'eid, are substantially true.

    the retina is spheroidal, the centre of visible direction will shift its
place along the axis of vision, and will correspond to the points where
lines perpendicular to the surface of the spheroid cut its lesser axis.
As the Almighty has not made the eye achromatic, because it was un
necessary, so he has, in the same wise economy of his power, not given
it the property of seeing visible points in their real directions.

On  a  New  Phenomenon            Boyf  Colour in certain specimens  of Fluor          Spar.
                                        Sir D. Brewster.

Mineralogists have long ago observed, in certain varieties of fluor
spar, a beautiful blue colour, different from that which is seen by trans
mitted light. Hatiy noticed this property in some of the fluor spars
from Derbyshire. Succeeding mineralogists, however, have confounded
this colour with the ordinary tints of the spar, and, so far as the author
knows, its nature and origin have not been successfully investigated. In
describing a species of dichroism, noticed by Dr. Prout* in the purpu-
       olfigahmt mtoon"iasoamned            Sir John Herschelt ascribes
rates                             potash,   conformation of the green     the reflected
green                             peculiar                               surfaces, pro

ducing what may be best termed a superficial colour, or one analogous
taoddtsh--e c"olAourreomfatrhkianblpelateexsa, mapnlde  striated or dotted surfaces."   And he
                                                         of such superficial colour,   differing
from the transmitted tints, is met with in the green fluor of Alston
Moor, which on its surfaces, whether natural or artificial, exhibits, in

certain lights, a deep blue tint, not to be removed by any polishing."
As the phenomenon which Sir D. Brewster had studied in the Derby
shire fluors was clearly one of internal structure, he was led to sup
pose that the superficial colour seen by Sir John Herschel on the
Alston Moor specimens, belonged to another class of phenomena; but
having attempted in vain to communicate the blue colour of the Alston
Moor crystals to wax or isinglass, he is disposed to believe that the
two phenomena are identical. In the fluors from Derbyshire, which
consist of differently coloured strata parallel to the faces of the cube,
the blue colour is most powerfully developed in the purplish brown or
bluish brown strata, in a less degree in the greenish strata, and scarcely,

if at all, in those layers which are colourless by transmitted light. In

the first of these cases, the blue colour may be distinctly seen emanating

from the interior of the crystal, when it is held in the common light of
day. In the sun's light the colour is still more brilliant; but the effect

may be greatly increased by covering the greater part of the crystal
with black wax, or by immersing it in a trough of glass covered ex
Ifternally with wax, and containing an oil of nearly the same refractive
power as the spar.                there are fissures within the crystal, they will
greatly influence the effect of the experiment, by reflecting to the eye
the transmitted light. In order, however, to witness this experiment
in all its beauty, and to have ocular evidence of its nature and charac
ter, a beam of condensed solar light should be transmitted through the
l lcrystal, as shown in the annexed figure, where
                                                        is the condensing
flens, its focus, and M n the system of differently coloured layers, tra
versed by the cone of refracted rays. The first layer of spar reflects
in all directions an intensely blue light; the two adjacent layers (sepa
rated by a thin layer which reflects blue light) reflect a light nearly
white ; the next layer gives a blue of exceeding brilliancy ; and so on
with the other layers, till the cone reaches the brown central nucleus,

which also reflects a rich blue tint, though inferior to that of one of

the preceding layers. In the green fluor of Alston Moor there are
also different layers, some of which are pink, and some of different
shades of green ; but the different shades of bine which they give out
under exposure to strong light, are not so strikingly contrasted as in
the Derbyshire specimens. As the blue colour now described is re
flected from surfaces within the spar, and as it does not occur in all

specimens, nor in every part of the same crystal, it must be produced
by extraneous matter of a different refractive power from the spar, in
troduced between the molecules of the crystal during its formation.
That the blue colour is not produced by shallow cavities or minute
pores, as in some of the opals, is inferred from the perfect transparency
of the specimens in which it occurs, and from the fact that the same
reflected tints are found in fluids, particularly the juices of plants ex
tracted by alcohol, and in several artificial glasses, particularly in those
of a. pink and orange colour, the former of which give a blue and the
latter a green colour. Having found that some of the dichroitic colours
in doubly refracting crystals were discharged by heat, it occurred to the
author that the blue tints in fluor spar might suffer a similar change,
and might even be connected with the phosphorescence of the mineral.
He therefore exposed two pieces, one of the Derbyshire and one of the
Alston Moor fluor, to a considerable heat. Both of them gave out a
blue phosphorescence, similar to that of the reflected tint, and much of
the natural colour of the fragments was discharged by the heat. In
both specimens the blue reflected tint was greatly diminished. In an
other specimen of the Alston Moor fluor, it appeared to be wholly re
moved ; but in a third, taken from the solid angle of the cube, the
blue tint still appeared, though with an impaired brilliancy. It is pos-

                                                                              *

sible, that a very intense heat might discharge the blue tint altogether,
but it is difficult to obtain satisfactory results with a mineral which de
crepitates by the action of heat, and thus prevents the observer from
comparing the tints under circumstances exactly the same.

An  Account   of  certain New Phenomena  of Diffraction.

                  By Sir D. Brewster.

    The phenomena of the inflexion or the diffraction of light observed
by Sir Isaac Newton, Fresnel, and others, were those which are visible
at a greater or less distance behind the diffracting body, and according
to the undulatory theory they are produced by the secondary waves
which fall converging on the points where the fringes appear within and
without the geometrical shadow. These fringes are all calculable by a
formula given by Fresnel, depending on the relation of the two quan
tities a and b, a being the distance of the place where the fringes are
formed from the diffracting body, and b the distance of the diffracting
body from the point from which the beam of light diverges. In the
phenomena hitherto studied, the quantity a is always positive. The
new phenomena discovered and described by Sir David Brewster are
those in which a is negative ; and they may be represented by a formula
differing from Fresnel's only in the sign of a. These new phenomena
are rendered visible by bringing lenses of different foci in contact with
the diffracting body, and the fringes seen in any case are those belong
ing to a value of-- a equal to the focal distance of the lens. The fringes
are in this case produced by the secondary waves, which proceed
diverging from the main wave, from a point between the diffracting body
and the luminous centre, whose distance from the former is a. When

--a is equal to b, the fringes are formed in parallel rays ; and when the
diffracting body is placed between the lens and the eye, they are formed
in converging rays. Hence, in studying these phenomena, we may use
a telescope with a micrometer, and obtain accurate measures. These

phenomena were illustrated by diagrams.

D. Brewster.

    These phenomena, when carefully produced by the various methods

which he explained, exhibited a series of splendidly coloured bands of

light, sometimes perfectly symmetrical and sometimes unsymmetrical,
accordingly as the diffracting body was regular or irregular in its section ;
and the author remarked, that an instrument could thus be constructed
for giving new patterns of ribands of all forms and colours. The theory
of the phenomena he considered quite simple and obvious, but he stated
that a comparison of the results of theory and experiment would be

difficult, from the difficulty of ascertaining the exact form of the dif

fracting body. (

    The phenomena described in this paper, discovered by the author,
were altogether new and of a very remarkable description. The spectra,
produced by the methods which were explained to the meeting, were
covered with bands like those produced by the action of nitrous gas
upon the spectrum, and the phenomena varied with the distance of the
grooves, with the relation of the dark and luminous intervals, and with
the inclination of the incident ray. Sir David Brewster described
analogous phenomena and others of a remarkable character when the
grooves were made in transparent surfaces ; and he explained to the
Section the manner in which he conceived the phenomena were pro
duced, on the principles of interference.

At the last meeting of the Association Sir D. Brewster communi
cated an account of a new property of light, which did not admit of

any explanation. Since that time he has had occasion to repeat and
vary the experiments; and having found the same property exhibited
in a series of analogous though different phenomena, he has no hesi
tation in considering this property of light as indicating a new species
of polarity in the simple elements of light, whether polarized or unpo-
larized. In the original experiment, two pencils of perfectly ho
mogeneous light, emanating from the same part of a well-formed
spectrum, interfered after one of them had been retarded by trans
mission through a thin plate of glass. The fringes were exceedingly
black, but no phenomena of colour were visible. He was anxious to

observe what would take place when the retarded pencil passed through
the edges of various plates differing very little in thickness, so that dif
ferent parts of it suffered different degrees of retardation, for the pre
ceding experiment entitled him to expect a series of overlapping bands
and lines of different sizes. In making such an experiment, however,
he encountered great difficulties, and he failed in every attempt to com
bine such a series of thin edges. He had recourse therefore to lami

their character by the slightest inclinations of the plate. But what sur
prised me most was to perceive that the spectrum exhibited the same

phenomena as if it had been acted upon by absorbing media, so that
we have here dark lines and the effects of local absorptions produced

periment. We have seen that the effects of interference are distinctly
developed in a certain position of the retarding plates. This position,
when the effects are most distinct, is that in which the edges of the
Ifplates are turned towards the red end of the spectrum and are parallel
to its fixed lines.                we give the plates a motion of rotation in their
own plane, the bands and lines and the phenomena of absorption be
come less and less distinct as the angle between the edges of the plates
and the lines of the spectrum increases. When this angle is 90° the
bands disappear altogether, and during the next 90° of rotation they
continue invisible. At 270° of azimuth they begin to reappear, and

attain their maximum distinctness at 360°, when they have returned to
their original position. Here then we have certain phenomena of in
terference, and also of absorption, distinctly exhibited when the least
refrangible side of the retarded ray is towards the most refrangible
side of the spectrum, or towards the most refrangible side of the unre-

tarded ray ; while the same phenomena disappear altogether when the
most refrangible side of the retarded ray is towards the least refrangible

Iside of the unretarded ray ; and between these two opposite positions

we have phenomena of an intermediate character. Hence conclude,
that the different sides of the rays of homogeneous light have different
properties when they                                                                 refraction or by the

ferent distances of the lens from the retina different diameters of it will
be placed in the axis of vision. As the diameters of a sphere are all
equal and similar, Mr. Clay Wallace considered that vision would be
equally perfect along the different diameters of the lens, brought by
rotation into the axis of vision. Sir David Brewster, however, remarked

that he had never found among his numerous examinations of the lenses
of fishes any which are perfectly spherical, as they were all either
oblate or prolate spheroids, so that along the different diameters of the
solid lens the vision would not be similarly performed.                      But, inde
pendent of this circumstance, he stated that in every solid lens there
was only one line or axis in which vision could be perfectly distinct,
namely, the axis of the optical figure, or series of positive and negative
luminous sectors, which are seen by the analysis of polarized light.
Along every other diameter the optical action of the lens is not sym
metrical. When the lens is not a sphere, but lenticular, as in the
human eye or in the eyes of most quadrupeds, Mr. Clay Wallace con
siders that the apparatus for adjustment is the ciliary processes, to
which this office had been previously ascribed, though not on the same
scientific grounds as those discovered by Mr. Wallace. One of the
most important results of Mr. Wallace's dissections is the discovery of
Jibres in the retina. These fibres may be rendered distinctly visible.
 They diverge from the base of the optic nerve, and surround the fora
 men ovale of Soemmerring at the extremity of the eye. Sir John Her-
schel had supposed such fibres to be requisite in the explanation of
the theory of vision, and it is therefore doubly interesting to find that

J.Sir Herschel states, that while crossing the Atlantic on his return
from the Cape, a shark was caught in lat. 2° N. and long, about 20° W.
Having procured the eyes, which were very large, and extracted the
crystalline lenses, the vitreous humour of each, in its capsule, presented
the usual appearance of a very clear, transparent, gelatinous mass, of
little consistency, but yet forming, very distinctly, a connected and
continuous body, easily separable from every other part. Wishing to
examine it more narrowly, it was laid to drain on blotting-paper ; and,
as this grew saturated, more was applied, till it became apparent that
the supply of watery liquid  was much                                  be accounted for

dantly, as to lead me to conclude that the gelatinous appearance of thin
humour, in its natural state, is a mere illusion, and that, in fact, it con
sisted of a liquid no way gelatinous, inclosed in a structure of trans
parent and, consequently, invisible cells. The vitreous humour of the
other eye, insulated as far as possible, was therefore placed in a saucer,
and beaten up with a fork, in the manner of an egg beaten up for culi
nary purposes. By this operation, the whole was resolved into a clear
watery liquid, in which delicate membranous flocks could be perceived,
and drawn out from the water in thready filaments, on the end of the
fork. From this experiment, it is clear that the vitreous humour (so
called) of this  fish is no jelly, but simply  a clear liquid, inclosed in some
close cellular   structure of transparent      membranous bags, which, by

their obstruction to the free movements of the contained liquid, imitate

the gelatinous state."

On  Binocular Vision ; and on     the Stereoscope,  an instrument  for  illus
          trating its phenomena.
                                   By Professor     Wheatstone.

    Professor Wheatstone stated that, at the last meeting of the Royal
Society, he had presented the first of a series of papers on the phe
nomena of vision, in the investigation of which subject he had been
for some years engaged. On the present occasion he proposed merety
to state so much as would enable him to explain the experiments which
the apparatus on the table was intended to exhibit. This apparatus he
called a Stereoscope, from its property of presenting to the mind the
perfect resemblances of solid objects. To understand the principles on
which it was constructed, he explained the circumstances which enable
us to distinguish an object in relief from its representation on a plane
surface ; he showed that when a solid object, a cube for instance, was
placed at a short distance before the eyes, its projections on the two
retinae form two dissimilar pictures, which in some cases are so different,
that even the eye of an artist would with difficulty recognise them as
representations of the same object ; notwithstanding this dissimilarity
of the two pictures, the object is seen single ; and hence it is evident
that the mind perceives the object in relief, in consequence of the
simultaneous perception of the two monocular pictures. He next
showed, that if the object were thus drawn, first as it appears to the
right eye, and then as it appears to the left eye, and those two pictures
be presented one to each retina, in such manner that they fall on the
parts as the projections from the object itself would, the mind perceives
a form in relief, which is the perfect counterpart of the object from
which the drawings have been taken : the illusion is so perfect, that no
effort of the imagination can induce the observer to suppose it to be a
picture on a plane surface. Professor Wheatstone described various

modes by which the two monocular pictures might be made to fall on
similar parts of the two retinae ; but he gave the preference to a method
which may be understood by the annexed diagram.

                 e e are the two eyes of the observer placed before two
                 plane mirrors, inclined to each other at an angle of
                 pp90°; the axes of the eyes converge to a point c; the
                 pictures  are so placed on sliding panels, that

                 their reflected images may be adjusted to appear at
                 the place of convergence of the optic axis ; it is ob-
            P vious, then, that the pictures on the retina? will be
precisely the same as if they proceeded from a real object placed at c.
In this manner may solid geometrical forms, crystals, flowers, busts,
architectural models, &c. be represented with perfect fidelity, as if the
objects themselves were before the eyes. The law of visible direction,
which is universally true, for all cases of monocular vision, may, Pro
fessor Wheatstone stated, be extended to binocular vision, by the
following rule : That every point of an object of three dimensions is
seen at the intersection of the two lines of visible direction, in which

that point is seen by each eye singly.

       By Sir John F. W.

   The notice of these observations laid before the Section reduced
itself to the following heads :

   Reduced Observations of 1232 Nebula? and clusters of Stars, made
in the years 1834, 5, 6, 7, 8, at the Cape of Good Hope, with the
twenty-feet Reflector.

   Reduced Observations of 1192 Double Stars of the Southern He

misphere.

Achromatic Equatorial Telescope.

   A List of the Approximate Places of fifteen Planetary and Annular
Nebulae of the Southern Hemisphere, discovered with the twenty-feet
Reflector.

principal Nebulae in the Southern Hemisphere.
   The observations in the first two of these communications form parts
of two catalogues of southern nebula? and double stars respectively,
which comprehend the chief results of the author's astronomical obser

vations at the Cape. They are complete only as far as the first nine
hours in right ascension. In the other hours, only a few of the objects
which occur are added, being the results of a partial and very incom
plete reduction of the observations in those hours. Sir John Herschel
considered it probable, that when the reduction of his observations
shall enable him to complete these catalogues, the total number of ob
jects contained in them will be nearly doubled. The first catalogue
contains all the nebulas and clusters comprised in the two Magellanic
clouds, which are very numerous. Each reduced observation ex

the third paper were taken with the same achromatic and micrometer,
and are arranged in precisely the same manner as the former similar
observations made by the author, which have been printed in the Trans

may be particularized a Centauri, ft Hydrae, y Coronae, and ir Lupi.
In the case of a Centauri, the diminution of distance, even within the
comparatively short period of observation, is remarkable ; and the
author stated verbally, that on examining the "catalogue of the Astro
nomical Society, that of Captain Johnson, and the Paramatta Cata
logue, in all which the places of the two stars are given separately,
he finds this diminution of distance fully borne out, and regularly pro
gressive ; from which he is led to conclude, that in no great number
of years from the present time (fifteen or twenty), the stars may be
expected to appear in contact, or to be actually occulted one by the
other, as has recently been observed to happen to y Virginis. The

blue colour, and being particularly                    well defined, has exactly the aspect
of a blue planet. No. 4 is a very bright and considerably large elliptic
disc of uniform light, on which, but excentric, is placed a pretty large
star. Several are very small; No. 15, in particular, is not more than
3" or 4" in diameter. Many of them occur in crowded parts of the

from the voluminous tables of the manner of registering the observa

tions respecting each star, double star, clusters, and nebulae ; he also
explained how, by the contrivance of a small achromatic collimator
placed inside of his great sweeping telescope, he was able to obtain

observatories : although, from the ropes and wooden frame with which

it was mounted, it was subjected to great hygrometic and pyroinetric
changes of form and position. These changes, however, by equally
affecting the cross of the collimator, and the object itself, were readily

detected and corrected.

passage on the night of the 25th of January. Mr. Maclear saw it on
the 24th. From this time we both observed it regularly. Its appear
ance was that of a round, well-defined disk, having near its centre a
very small bright object exactly like a small comet, and surrounded by
a faint nebula. This nebula in two or three more nights was absorbed
into the disc, and disappeared entirely. Meanwhile, the disc itself di

intersection with  the              axis, I was led, at  the time, to this very singular

conclusion, viz. that on the 21st of January, at 2h. p.m., the disc must
have been a point-- or ought to have had no magnitude at all ! in other
words, at that precise epoch some very remarkable change in the phy
sical condition of the comet must have commenced. So far all was
speculation. But in entire harmony with it is the following fact

communicated  I  to me no longer ago than last month by                  the venerable
Olbers, whom      visited in my passage through Bremen,                  and who was

so good as to show me a letter he had just received from M. Bogus-
lawski, Professor of Astronomy at Breslau, in which he states that he
had actually procured an observation of that comet on the night of the
2m1asgtnoitfuJdaenu--aray.brigInht  that observation        it appeared  as a star of the  sixth
                                      concentrated       point, which                      with
                                                                         showed no disc,

a magnifying power of 140 ! And that it actually was the comet, and
no star, he satisfied himself, by turning his telescope the next night on
that point where he had seen it. It was gone ! Moreover, he had
taken care to secure, by actual observation, the place of the star he
Iobserved ; that place agreed to exact precision with his computation ;

that star was the comet, in short. Now, think this observation every
way remarkable. First, it is remarkable for the fact, that M. Bogus-
lawski was able to observe it at all on the 21st. This could not have

been done, had he not been able to direct his telescope point blank on
the spot, by calculation, since it would have been impossible in any
other way to have known it from a star. And, in fact, it was this
very thing which caused Mr. Maclear
                                                         and myself      to miss procuring
earlier observations. I am sure that I                   must often      have swept, with a

night-glass, over the very spot whore it stood in the mornings before

sunrise ; and never was astonishment greater than mine at seeing it

riding high in the sky, broadly visible to the naked eye, when pointed
out to me by a notice from Mr. Maclear, who saw it with no less
amazement on the 24-th. The next remarkable feature is the enor
mously rapid rate of dilatation of the disc and the absorption into it of
all trace of the surrounding nebula. Another, is the interior cometic
nucleus. All these phenomena, while they contradict every other hy

    Having observed the surprising accuracy with which the difference
of longitudes of London and Paris had been obtained by Mr. Dent's
chronometers, Sir Thomas Brisbane applied to that gentleman, who,
with great liberality, furnished for the purpose of the experiments
twelve of his valuable chronometers. With these, the differences of
longitude of London, Edinburgh, and Mukerstoun were taken ; and by
a mean of all the observations taken in going to the latter station and
in returning, they were found to differ only by five one-hundredths of
a second. He exhibited to the Section the following table.

station was (speaking generally) complete ; the extreme of deviation,
which formerly exceeded 100°, did not, with the corrector, exceed 1°.

IAt the other stations I had not leisure to adjust the apparatus : but
fully expect to-morrow to produce the same accordance at them. This
result is, I should think, important in a practical sense. Some theo

retical results which I did not anticipate are also obtained. At the stern

position, the disturbance is produced almost entirely by the permanent

magnetism, the inductive magnetism producing only fe of the whole
effect. Going towards the head, the effect of the permanent magnetism
diminishes, and that of the inductive magnetism increases, till the latter
produces about y of the whole effect. The resolved part of the per
manent magnetism transverse to the ship varies little (increasing
somewhat towards the head): the part longitudinal to the ship decreases

great hurricane of that year, which, in the short space of seven hours,
killed upwards of 1400 persons on that island alone. He was for two
years and a half daily employed as an engineer officer, amidst the
ruined buildings, and was thus naturally led to the consideration of the
phenomena of hurricanes, and earnestly sought for every species of
information which could give a clue to explain them.

    The first reasonable explanation met with was given in a small
pamphlet, extracted from the American Journal of Science, written by
W. C. Redfield, of New York.

   The gradual progress made in our acquaintance with the subject of
storms is not uninteresting. The north-cast storms on the coast of

America had attracted the attention of Franklin. One of these storms
preventing his observing an eclipse of the moon in Philadelphia, he
was much surprised to find that the eclipse had been visible at Boston,
which town is north-east of Philadelphia : this was a circumstance not
to be lost on such an inquiring mind as Franklin's. By examination
he ascertained that this north-cast storm came from the south-west ; but
he died before he had made the next step in this investigation.

    Colonel Capper, of the East India Company's Service, after having
studied meteorological subjects for twenty years in the Madras terri
tory, wrote a work on the winds and monsoons in 1801. He states his
belief that hurricanes will be found to be great whirlwinds, and that
the place of a ship in these whirlwinds may be ascertained ; for, the
nearer to the vortex, the faster will the wind veer; and subsequent
inquiries prove that Colonel Capper was right in this opinion.

    Mr. Redfield, following up the observations of Franklin, probably
without knowing those of Colonel Capper, ascertained that whilst the
north-east storms were blowing on the shore of America, the wind,
with equal violence, was blowing a south-west storm in the Atlantic.
Tracking Franklin's storms from the southward, he found throughout
their course that the wind on opposite sides blew in opposite directions ;
and that, in fact, they were progressive whirlwinds, their manner of re
volving being always in the same direction. By combining observations
on the barometer with the progressive movement of storms, Mr. Red-
field appears to have given the first satisfactory explanation of its rise
and fall in stormy weather, and Colonel Heid's observations confirm his

views.

   The first step taken by the author, in furtherance of this inquiry,
was to project maps on a large scale, in order to lay down Mr. Red-
field's observations, and thus to be better able to form a judgment on
the mode of action of the atmosphere.

    These maps, which have now been engraved for publication in a
separate work, were laid before the Association. The wind is marked
on them by arrows. On the right-hand side of the circles the arrows
will be observed to be flying from the south ; on the left-hand, coming
back from the north.

   The field of inquiry which this opens can be but merely indicated
here ; to proceed in a satisfactory manner with the inquiry, the study
being a new one, requires that the proofs be exhibited step by step.

The inferences drawn from the facts appear very important, and the
further pursuit of the investigation well deserving attention.
    The manner in which Colonel Reid has followed it up has been by-
procuring the actual log-books of ships, and combining their inform
ation with what could be obtained  on land,
neous observations over extended   tracts.   so  as to  cVomIIp. awreeresimreuplrtea

sented thirty-five ships in the same storm, the tracks of several cross
ing the storm's path, and the wind as reported by the ships corroborated
by the reports from the land.
   The observations of ships possess this great advantage for meteoro

logical research, that merchant log-books report the weather every two
hours, and ships of war have hourly observations always kept up.

   Alter tracing a variety of storms in north latitudes, the author was
struck with the apparent regularity with which they appear to pass to
the North Pole ; and was thence led to suppose, from analogy, that
storms in south latitude would be found to revolve in a precisely con
trary direction to that which they take in the northern hemisphere.

Earnestly seeking for facts to ascertain if this were really the case, he
had obtained much information to confirm the truth of the opinion
before he was at all aware that Mr. Redtield had conjectured the same
thing, without, however, having    himself traced
                                   the course of a  any storms in south
latitude. Chart VIII. represents                    storm productive of
very disastrous consequences, encountered by the East India fleet, under

Ifconvoy, in 1809, and it is strikingly illustrative of this important fact.

        storms obey fixed laws, and we can ascertain what those laws are,
the knowledge of them must be highly useful to navigation ; but to
apply the principles practically, requires that seamen should study and
understand them. The problem so long desired to be solved, viz. on
which side to lay to a ship in a storm, Colonel Iteid trusts is now ex

plained.
   By watching the mode of veering of the wind, the portion of a storm
into which a ship is falling may be ascertained. The object required
is, that the wind, in veering, shall veer aft instead of ahead ; and that
a vessel shall come up instead of having to break off. To accomplish
this the ship must be laid on opposite tacks, on opposite sides of a
storm ; but the limits of this notice render it impossible to attempt an

explanation in detail.
   The researches which have been carried into the southern hemi
sphere afford a very interesting explanation of the observations of
Capt. King, in his sailing directions for the southern extremity of Ame
rica, namely, that the rise and fall of the barometer in storms corre
spond with the rise and fall in high northern latitudes ; east and west
remaining the same, but north and south changing places.
Five connected storms which occurred in 1837, and followed each
other in close succession, possess an interest altogether new, for they
give us a clue to explain tlie variable winds. Since these whirlwinds
revolve by an invariable law, and always in the same direction, every
new storm changes the wind.   Thus           hurricane of the middle of
August 1837, traced on Chart         the     hardly passed towards the

The storms expanding in size, and diminishing in force, as they pro

ceed towards the poles, and the meridians at the same time approaching

each other, gales become huddled together; and hence, apparently,
the true cause of the very complicated nature of the winds in the lati
tude of our own country.
    Since great storms in high latitudes often extend over a circular
space of 1000 miles, the length and breadth of the British Islands afford
far too limited sphere for their study. Nations should unite to study
the laws of atmospheric changes. By exchanging the observations
Ifmade at the light-houses of different countries, reports would be ob
tained along the coasts of the whole civilized world.                    the merchant

log-books, instead of being destroyed, which often the case at pre
sent, were preserved in depots, each great commercial port keeping
its own, they would greatly assist in giving information, by simulta
neous observations on the sea and along the coast. The meteorolo
gical reports within the interior of different countries should, after the

same manner, be exchanged, and we should then soon be enabled to
trace the tracks of storms over almost the entire surface of the globe.
   (The author then alluded to certain electro-magnetic phenomena,
which offer close analogies to the phenomena of revolving storms.)

   During his investigation of the law of storms Colonel Reid endea
voured also to ascertain the laws by which water-spouts revolve. After
many fruitless researches, he obtained at length two satisfactory in

stances, one of which from Captain Beechey. It remarkable, that

in these two instances, which occur in opposite hemispheres, the revo
lutions are in opposite directions, but both in the contrary direction
to great storms. The double cones in water-spouts, one pointing up
wards from the sea, the other downwards from the clouds, peculiarly
mark these phenomena, and we ought to observe whether the cloud
above, and the sea below, revolve in the same directions with each other.
To ascertain their electrical state would be also highly interesting, and
this perhaps may not be impracticable, for the great hydrographer and
navigator Horsburgh actually put his ship through small phenomena of
this description, in order to examine them.
   Colonel Reid notices the apparent accordance of the force of storms
with the law of magnetic intensity, as exhibited by Major Sabine's re
port to the Association. It frequently remarked, with astonishment,
that no storms occur at St. Helena the degree of magnetic intensity

isodynamic lines to express less than unity are only marked there, and
they appear, as were, to mark the true Pacific Ocean of the world.
The lines of greatest intensity, on the contrary, seem to correspond
with the localities of typhoons and hurricanes, for we find the meridian
of the American Magnetic Pole passing not far from the Caribbean
Sea, and that of the Siberian pole through the China Sea.

Philadelphia.

   The experiments referred to grew out of a report made at the request
of the British Association, on the quantity of rain collected at different
heights, which was presented at the Cambridge meeting of the Associa
tion by Professor Phillips and Mr. William Gray, jun. Professor Rogers
was then present, and at his instance the author commenced a series of
observations about the close of the year 1833. Philadelphia, from the
extent of the plain on which it stands, is a good locality for such a pur
pose. The observations were at first made by gauges placed at three
different heights. One of these stations was the top of a tower for
merly used for making shot. The height of the tower is 162 feet. A
second was near the ground within the inclosure about the tower, and
the intermediate one was the roof of the university. The author's at
tention was ultimately fixed upon the fact that the effect of eddy winds
upon the phenomena observed, was by no means a secondary one in
amount, and that he could not hope to deduce a law, nor to throw any
light on the nature of the phenomena, until this disturbing action was
got rid of. He has therefore thought that it might be useful to those
who may undertake similar experiments, to submit some of the evi
dence of the effects which he attributes to deflected currents of air.
The observations on this point were chiefly made at the upper station,
on the top of the tower. The tower is square in its section, and the
alternate sides are nearly parallel and perpendicular to the meridian.
At the roof the horizontal section is about twelve feet on a side, and a
parapet wall, cut like a battlement, surrounds it. At first, one gauge
was placed at the N.W. angle of the tower, rising about six inches
above the parapet wall ; subsequently, a gauge for collecting snow was
placed at the S.W. angle ; and ultimately, four gauges, besides the ori
ginal one, were placed at the four corners of the tower, upon the para
pet wall, above which they rose about ten inches. The rain gauges
consisted of an inverted cone, with a cylindrical rim, about five inches
 in diameter, attached to the base, and a small aperture near the vertex;
 this fastened tightly upon a vessel serving as a reservoir. The snow
 gauges wove frustums of upright cones, the upper section being nearly
2C EIGHTH REPORT 1838.

four inches in diameter. The water was measured in a glass tube, iu
which one-thousandth of an inch of rain fallen was measurable. When
the snow gauges became useless, they were used as rain gauges, by at
taching a funnel to them, or were finally replaced by rain gauges simi
lar to those described. The quantity of water collected was measured
after each rain, and the direction of the wind during the rain was fre
quently noted. To illustrate the effects which are attributed to cur
rents of air deflected by the tower, Professor Bache has taken from the
journal of the latter months of observation the records of the quanti
ties of rain collected by four similar gauges, placed at the four angles
of the tower, under different circumstances as to the direction of the
wind. These are selected so as to present, as far as possible, a case of
rain with each principal direction of the wind.

   On this table the author remarks, -- 1. That it illustrates the very
great differences between the quantities of rain collected at the different
angles of the tower. In one extreme case the quantity collected at the
S.E. angle was 2^ times that at ^he N.W. angle. 2. That, in general,

the gauges to leeward received more rain than those to windward.
Thus, with a north wind, the gauges at the S.E. and S.W. angles re
ceived more rain than those at the N.E. and N.W. angles. With a
N.E. wind the gauge at the S.W. corner of the tower received the most
rain. In the case given in the table, the ratio of the quantities is nearly
2-1 to 1. With an easterly wind the N.E. and S.E. gauges received
less than the N.W. and S.W. With a south-easterly wind the S.E.
gauge received the least, and the N.W. the greatest quantity of rain,
and so on, nearly in tiie order stated in the general remark. 3. As the
more considerable rains accompany certain winds, it is not to be ex
pected that averages of any number of observations exposed to such
errors will lead to an accurate result of the quantity of rain falling at
a certain height above the surface. In fact, the averages from a period
of nine months do not agree nearly so well as those from the selected
specimens in the table. These give ratios of 1, 1*19, 1*24, and 1*20,
                TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                          27

for the quantities at the different angles ; while the former-mentioned
averages at the N.E. and S.W. angles are nearly as one to one and a half.

on the top of York Minster. The differences that appeared in this case
were very trifling indeed : thus, on the 26th of August, when the N.E.
and S.W. gauges upon the parapet wall gave quantities in the ratio of
1 to 1*68, those six feet above the parapet gave 1 to P08 ; with a more
moderate wind the qualities were more nearly the same."
The author proposes to resume this inquiry with reference to the ge
                  on his return to              America.     (See Reports of the

    Effects so very local, as shown by rain-gauges, at short distances
apart in our own island, must arise, Dr. Smith imagines, from local
causes. The general remark, that much less rain falls on the eastern
than on the western side of England, stands confirmed by the tables ;
and as at Edinburgh there fall only 22 inches, and in Dublin 22-2, it
seems likely to hold in other parts. The local variations in the quan
tities of rain in England are, however, very great ; and in a short table
of sixteen local averages, from 67 inches at Keswick, down to 22'7
at South Lambeth, the half of them on the western side of England
are by far the highest ; but the comparatively small quantities of rain
at Bristol and Chatsworth not according with this generalization, and one

place on the eastern coast being even higher than these, and higher than
Liverpool, this generalization, Dr. Smith conceived, required to be
modified. More local causes seemed requisite to account for the ob
served facts ; and Dr. Smith imagined that they are to be found in the
nature of the surrounding country, that in the physical differences of
the vicinity of each place, and not altogether in the track of the most
rainy winds.

   In confirmation of this opinion, meteorological registers were quoted
to show that, although westerly and southerly winds blow at London
101 days more than the drier easterly or northerly winds, yet London

    the least rainy place in Britain, except Edinburgh, which averages
seven tenths lower than South Lambeth. The cause of much rain de
pends not, therefore, he conceived, wholly on the prevalence of westerly
is
                                                                                  is,

winds ; but, in part at least, on the humidity of the neighbouring re
gions. The westerly winds, before they reach London, pass over a great
extent of high and dry land ; and, consequently, there is, at the level of
the chalk hills (600 to 800 feet high), a dry atmosphere over London.
Bristol, having 5'2 inches less rain than Liverpool, and nearly seven
inches less than Manchester, is surrounded by high and dry hills of
limestone ; and Chatsworth, having 4 inches less than Bristol, is also,
except on the eastern side, surrounded by very high and dry hills. Dr.
Smith illustrated this part of his argument by reference to other places.
Manchester, having 36*1 inches, is not far west of the high and damp
hills of millstone grit, which here form the summit ridge of England ;
but about Lancaster, the width of wet-topped hills increases, so that
vapour from these, the southern swampy shore, and of the tides and
sands of Morecambe bay, may account for 39"7 at Lancaster. Townly,
high, and in the vicinity of bog-topped hills, has 41*5; Grisdale, West
morland, 52*3 ; and Kendal 53-9 ; the latter, perhaps, partly from the
hills, and partly from Lancaster sands and adjacent marshes ; but Kes
wick averages 67 inches. This, perhaps, is the greatest quantity of rain
which falls at any one place in England, and is perhaps to be accounted
for by the peculiar situation of Keswick, at the meeting of four valleys,
whicli intersect a group of very high mountains, and near to swampy
ground, and large pieces of water, on which the winds have great in
fluence in raising vapour, which the cold sides of the mountains rapidly
condense. These hill tops, as well as those of millstone grit, have a
covering of peat, which holds water like a sponge.

count *. It is a brine spring, having 3 per cent, of salt, rising in a bore,
325 Bavarian feet deep, in red sandstone ; but the author understands
that the water flows at about 200 feet in depth. Its temperature is never
            65°; the    mean temperature of springs near being only 50° to
less  than  discharges    carbonic acid gas in volumes almost unexampled,

keeping the water, in a shaft eight feet diameter, in a state resembling
turbulent ebullition. The enormous supply of gas has led to its use in
Itgas baths, for which purpose it is carried off by a tube connected with
a huge inverted funnel, which rests upon the water.    contains scarcely
a trace of nitrogen. It is conducted into chambers properly prepared,
and thence into baths, in which it lies by its weight, and is used as water
would be. But the most remarkable feature still remains to be noticed.
About five or six times a day the discharge of gas suddenly stops ; in a
few seconds the surface of the well is calm. The flow of water, amount-

observations recorded at Fort Diamond, above Quebec.

30 EIGHTH REPORT 1838.

It would be interesting to find out, whether this reduction of tem
perature indicated a permanent change in the climate of Canada, or
whether the years noticed constitute the coldest portion of a cycle of
longer duration, and consquently give a result below the actual mean.
Dr. Daubeny remarks, that the position selected for meteorological
observations at Quebec is so elevated and exposed that it does not
fairly represent the mean temperature of the neighbourhood. In the
United States the best observations made are those carried on at the
several academies in the state of New York, under the direction of the
state government. The author has quoted a sufficient number of
                          notion  of the           of that  portion of the Union,
these to  "coAnnvneuyala  Report  of the  climate   of the  University of the State
and the                                   Regents

of New York" for the remainder. The mean temperature of Phila

delphia cannot yet be regarded as settled, though good observations
have been carried on for the last three years by Captain Mordecai.
J.These have been quoted in preference to others of longer date
reported by Mr.           Young, stated by him to have been deduced from

twenty years observations, as the mean obtained by the latter (58'i) is
so much above that of places lying to the south (Washington and
Richmond for instance), that we are driven to suppose that the spot

selected must have been an unsuitable one.

On the Helm Wind of Cross/ell. By the liev. J. Watson.

Helm Wind is a local name of uncertain origin, but generally sup
posed to be derived from the cloud that, like a cap or helmet, is often

seen on the tops of the mountains. It is specially applied to a very violent

wind, blowing frequently from some easterly point of the compass, but
mostly due east, at the west side of the mountains known by the name
of the Crossfell range, and confined both in length and breadth to the

space contained between the Helm and Helm Bar, hereafter described.
Along the top ridge of the mountains, and extending from three or
four to sixteen or eighteen miles each way, north and south, from the
highest point, is often seen a large long roll of clouds ; the western
front clearly defined and quite separated from any other cloud on that
side ; it is at times above the mountain, sometimes rests on its top, but

most frequently descends a considerable way down its side ; this is called
the Helm. In opposition to this, and at a variable distance towards
the west, is another cloud with its eastern edge as clearly defined as

the Helm, and at the same height : this is called the JBar or Uurr; the
space between the Helm and the Bar is the limit of the wind. The

distance between the Helm and Bar varies as the Bar advances or
recedes from the Helm; this is sometimes not more than half a mile,

sometimes three or four miles, and occasionally the Bar seems to
coincide with the horizon, or it disperses and there is no Bar, and then

there is a general east wind extending over all the country westward.
However violent the wind be between the Helm and the Bar, it extends
no farther; on the west side of the Bar there is either no wind or it

blows in a contrary direction, that is, from the west, or from various
points in sudden and strong gusts, when the Bar advances so far as to

unite with the Helm ; if the Bar disperses, the wind ceases. Neither the

Helm nor Bar are separate or detached clouds, but may be rather said
to be the bold, clearly denned fronts of bodies of clouds extending east
ward behind the Helm, and westward from the Bar. The clouds forming
the Helm and Bar cannot perhaps strictly be said to be parallel ; the
open space between them may rather be called a very flat ellipse,
in which the transverse diameter varies from eight or ten to twenty-five
or thirty miles, and the conjugate from half a mile to four or five miles :

they appear always united at the ends.

   This wind is very irregular, but most frequent from the end of Sep
tember to the month of May; it seldom occurs in the summer months ;
there was one this year, 1838, on the 2nd of July, and there have been
more in the last two years than in the preceding six. Sometimes,
when the atmosphere is quite settled, not a breath of wind stirring,
and hardly a cloud to   be seen, a small but    well-known   tchleou"d

overthrow stacks of grain, throw a person from his horse, or overturn
a horse and cart. The Helm at times seems violently agitated, and on
ascending the fell and entering it there is little wind, and this some
times not in the direction of the wind below : one may, in fact, be in

the Helm for a whole day without being aware of the wind on the west.
The Helm appears sometimes to run or pour off from the highest
part, each way towards the north and south points of the junction of
the Helm and Bar, and there to be piled up in great masses ; occa

sionally a Helm forms and goes off without a blast. The open space
between the Helm and Bar is clear of clouds, with the exception of small

pieces breaking off now and then from the Helm and driving rapidly
over to the Bar ; through this open space is often seen a higher stratum
of clouds quite at rest.

Most mountainous countries, particularly where the mountains ter
minate abruptly, seem liable to sudden gusts of wind, such as occur at
the Cape of Good Hope, in Switzerland, and among the lakes in our
own country ; but the Helm wind differs from all in respect to the Bar,
and that within the space described it blows continually ; it has been

known to blow for nine days together, the Bar advancing or receding,
or continuing stationary for a day. When heard and felt for the first
time it does not seem so very extraordinary ; but when we find it
blowing and roaring morning, noon, and night, for days together, it

makes a strong impression on the mind, and we are compelled to ac
knowledge that it is one of the most singular phenomena of meteorology.
Its sound is peculiar, and when once known is easily distinguished from
that of ordinary winds ; it cannot be heard more than three or four
miles beyond its limit, but by persons who have stood within the wind

The subjects contained in Mr. Dent's paper may be arranged under

three heads.
1st. The continuation of an inquiry into the compound effect of
      variable temperature upon the regulating machinery of Time
      keepers, the commencement of which had been laid before the

       Association some years before.

2nd. A description of improvements in mercurial pendulums, princi
      pally with a view of making them portable.

3rd. Improvements in the suspension of pendulums in general ; and
         incidental remarks connected with the subject.
   In all estimates of the effect of variable temperature upon the regu
lating part of timekeepers, made for the purpose of ascertaining the
necessary amount of compensation, it had generally been assumed
that the effect was confined to an alteration of length in a part of the
regulator. Mr. Dent, having long felt that this view of the subject was
insufficient to account for facts which his daily practice brought be
fore him, at length commenced a series of experiments with a view to
a more complete and consistent explanation of them; and, in 1833, at
the meeting of the Association in Cambridge, he endeavoured to show
that the effect of variable temperature upon the balance-springs of
chronometers might be resolved into two distinct portions : viz. the
one, long known, which produces the variation of length ; and an-
ot/ier, which had hitherto escaped attention, affecting the elasticity of the

spring.
Mr. Dent afterwards extended the inquiry to the pendulums of clocks,
and succeeded in separating and determining the respective amounts of
effect which changes of temperature produce upon the elasticity of the
spring and the length of the rod. The details of this subsequent in
quiry, with descriptions of the apparatus invented and used for the pur

A clock provided with a spring-pendulum, and adjusted to keep cor
rect time at an ordinary temperature, was found, when the temperature
was maintained at 48° Fahr. higher, to lose twelve seconds in twenty-
four hours.
   Mr. Dent attempts to demonstrate by experiment that eight parts
and a half only of this difference belong to the effect of elongation in
the rod, and the remaining one and a half are produced by a decrease
of elasticity in the spring.
   From the epoch of the introduction of the mercurial cistern to the

present time, this admirable modification of the pendulum has remained
nearly in the state in which it was left by its inventor.

   The mercurial pendulum cannot even now be filled and transported

quently in the case of the transport of clocks with this description of
pendulum to great distances, either this part of the machine (which re
gulates the whole) must be placed in inexperienced hands, to be filled
with mercury and to have the column adjusted to the exact length re
quired for compensation, or a workman must accompany the clock and
set it in action. The expense of the latter process constitutes, gene

rally, a very serious objection.
    The pendulum cistern being made of glass, is liable to fracture, and,
on account of the risk which attends the boiling the mercury within

it, to drive off the air, this process is never attempted. It is very pos
sible to give to a glass vessel, externally, a form mathematically correct,
but the case is very different when similar accuracy is required for the
interior. The glass cistern, therefore, never receives a perfect figure,
and the mercurial column it contains cannot be a regular cylinder. This
condition, combined with the irregularity of expansion which glass is pe
culiarly liable to from its compound nature, renders measurement and
calculation with regard to the column, so vague and deceptive that they

are never employed.
    In order to meet these serious obstacles to the satisfactory and ex
tensive use of this valuable instrument Mr. Dent has recommended the

substitution of cast-iron for glass in the cistern.

    Mercury and cast-iron are quite as little disposed to amalgamate as
mercury and glass ; and iron is a material, compared with glass, which

is more simple in its nature, and more obedient to the workman. It is

susceptible of the most perfect forms, which it will maintain with very
little liability to alteration, and is quite proof against numerous acci
dents that would be fatal to glass. The expansion of iron by heat being
also uniform and well known, it is evident that, in the cast-iron cistern,

ifwe may have a vessel of a known, regular, and permanent figure, or,

not strictly permanent, one whose changes and their laws we are acquaint
ed with. Calculation may, therefore, be used in anticipating results, with

justment so perfect that may be instantly attached to the wheel-work
by any workman capable of setting the clock upon its supports. If, at

   subsequent period, minute portions of air have, from any cause, again
mingled with the mercury, and rendered the pendulum susceptible of
barometric changes, the air may be again driven off with the greatest
facility, by repeating the process of boiling, without removing the mer
cury from the cistern.
   Mr. Dent has accompanied the introduction of cast-iron in the cistern
with several other alterations which have all the same intention of im
proving this kind of pendulum. Among others, he has removed en
tirely the metal stirrup, or frame, which carried the cistern, and has at
          the latter to                    ;--he has

   All strain or warp of the spring, in the final suspension of the pendu

lum, can be avoided. The pendulum being first suspended freely, id
left until, by the cessation of its action, it arrives at its own line of rest
in every direction, particularly in that which passes through the plane of
the spring. The fixing-piece is then brought to it and the whole per
manently attached together.

   The line of the flexure of the spring can be determined and preserved.
Usually, the exact position of this line is, within certain limits, left to
accident, and is, from several causes, continually changing its position ;
consequently, the pendulum is simultaneously varying in length. Er
rors in rate, often attributed to other causes, are the necessary conse

quence.

   The instrument is a glass tube about 0"25 of an inch in diameter,
and about 14 inches long, with a small bulb like that of a thermometer
blown on the upper end. The stem of the tube has been graduated by
divisions made experimentally by the instrument-maker in the follow
ing manner. On a day when the barometer stood at 30 inches, and
the temperature of the air was 62°, it was placed in the receiver of an
air-pump, and when the rarefaction allowed the barometer of the
pump to fall to 29 inches, the instrument was lowered until the open
end of the tube became immersed in a cup of water, over which it had
been suspended by a thread and wire passing through a stuffing-box.
On allowing the atmosphere to enter the receiver, the water was pressed
up the tube until the density of the air corresponding to 30 inches
was restored, and the height of the fluid was carefully marked. The
instrument was a second time suspended in the air-pump receiver, and
the exhaustion was repeated until the barometer gauge indicated 28
inches, the immersion in the cup having been made as formerly ; the
air rushed in, and the graduation of the tube corresponding to 28
inches was accomplished. By continuing this process, the graduation
of the stem was carried on as far as was thought requisite, (the inter
mediate divisions having been made in a similar manner,) when the in
strument became ready for use.

   It is obvious, that in this manner a traveller arriving at a station in
the midst of mountains, and having with him a number of such tubes,

would only require to send messengers to their summits with one or
more of these tubes and a tin case containing water, for the purpose of
giving him the means of determining their heights with considerable
accuracy. Each messenger, carrying with him the empty glass tubes,
is to be instructed to insert their open ends in his flask of water when
he sludl have reached the summit, and to bring them down again.
38 EIGHTH REPORT -- 1838.

Having done so, the air in the bulb and tube having become rarified
to the tension of that on the top of the mountain, is compressed by the
water which the increased pressure of the atmosphere as he descends

forces into the tube, so that when he returns to the place where the
barometer is at 30 inches, the height of the fluid will indicate the
Ifheight at which the barometer would have stood on the summit of the
elevation.  the barometer be not exactly at that height, a correction

Ifmay be applied.

       the temperature and degree of moisture of the air in the tube on
the mountain and at the lower station were alike, no further correction
would be requisite : but just as in the case of the barometer so with
this instrument ; for minute accuracy, a thermometer and hygrometer

should accompany   and be simultaneously observed, so as to permit

the application of the usual corrections.
   In many cases precisely equal temperatures may be obtained at the

upper and lower stations by keeping the tin case supplied with water,
melting snow, or ice.
   In a general and rapid survey of               country, such instruments would

possess value from their portability and cheapness.

explosion of the gaseous elements of water, any gaseous or volatile in
flammatory matter be present, instead of condensing there will be a
permanent gas, formed by the union of the nascent water with the in
flammable matter. Thus, two volumes of oxygen with four of hydro
gen and one of olefiant gas, give six volumes of permanent gas, which
burns like light carburetted hydrogen. The same quantity of the pure
hydrogen and oxygen with half a volume of hydric ether, give, on the
average the same residue. One volume of the new ether, under like

The great difference which exists between different specimens of
iron generally known. The best Swedish iron when compared with
British iron, even of the best quality, in point of strength as to 3.

A Swedish wire of a diameter of about Tjth of an inch supports a
weight of 450 lbs. without breaking, while the utmost weight that a
wire of British iron of the same diameter can bear 350 lbs. Iron
from the mine of Dannemora in Sweden makes excellent steel; while
British iron so ill adapted for the purpose that
                                                                                          hardly ever con
verted into steel, and never into good steel. Dr. Thomson thought
likely that their differences were owring to something in the British
iron which injured its quality and which was wanting in Swedish iron.
The results of some analyses made by Dr. Thomson do not entirely
clear up the question but they present some important information
on the peculiarities of iron. The following the statement of the ex;

tha"n  To analyze Dannemora iron                   I  dissolved  100 grains of it in muriatic

acid, evaporated the solution to dryness in a gentle heat, and redis-
solved the residue in water slightly acidulated with muriatic acid.
There remained undissolved a gray-coloured matter, which was tho

roughly washed, and dried at a temperature of 300°. It weighed 0-32
gr. or very nearly one-third of a grain. Being ignited in a platinum cru
cible, the weight was reduced to 0-06 gr. of a gray matter, which,
examined before the blow-pipe, proved to be silica very slightly tinged
with iron. The 0-26 gr. lost by ignition was probablv carbon ; for a
temperature of 300° was doubtless sufficient to drive off all the water

several hours in a flask, to peroxidize the iron. When cold, the excess of
acid was neutralized as exactly as possible by carbonate of soda, taking

care that no precipitate fell. It was then raised to the boiling point
and thrown upon a filter. The whole peroxide of iron which it con
tains is retained upon the filter, and must be well washed with hot wa

ter. At first the water passes through the filter quite colourless ; but
when most of the common salt is washed out the oxide of iron begins
to pass also. To prevent this we must wash it with water containing
sal ammoniac dissolved in it : this salt not only prevents the oxide of
iron from passing, but the solution of it speedily replaces the common
salt in the oxide, and thus enables us to wash it much more speedily
and completely than we otherwise could do. The oxide being washed,

dried, and ignited, weighed 142*23 grains, equivalent to 99-56 grains
of "iroTnh.e solution thus freed from iron was evaporated to dryness by a
gentle heat: the residue redissolved completely in water, showing the
absence of phosphate or arseniate of iron. The solution being mixed
with carbonate of soda, a white powder fell, weighing alter ignition
0O7 grains. It was brownish red, and being fused with carbonate of
soda it exhibited the well-known characters of red oxide of manganese.

It was equivalent to 0 0.5 grain of manganese. According to this
analysis, the constituents of Dannemora iron are

" Thus almost the only foreign matter in Dannemora iron is carbon,
which cannot be injurious as far as steel-making is concerned ; for the

striking difference in the specific gravity of these three irons. I rather

ascribe this difference to a mechanical cause ; the Dannemora iron has
Ifprobably been exposed to longer hammering or rolling than either of
the British specimens.       this be so, it will in some measure explain
its greater strength, for the strength of iron, cateris paribus, is well
known to increase with the degree of hammering to which it has been

subjected."

   " Though the existence of sugar in the urine of persons labouring

under the disease called diabetes mellitus, has been known for more
than a century and a half, having been discovered by Dr. Willis, who
died in the year 1678, and though it has been frequently extracted
from such urine and exhibited in a state of purity, the author was not
aware that experiments requisite to determine its nature had been
made. After noticing the statement of Dr. Prout (Phil. Trans. 1827),
that such sugar contained gr. 36 to 4-0 per cent, of carbon, and gr. 60
to 64 per cent, water ; Dr. Thomson described the results of some ex
periments which he had recently undertaken to remove the uncertainty
which appeared to involve the subject."

    By evaporation, and subsequent digestion in alcohol, the sugar was
obtained white, and by re-solution in boiling alcohol and slow cooling,
acicular crystals were obtained. Specific gravity, when simply dried

without limit in boiling water, and at 62° in its own bulk of water.

   By analysis with oxide of copper, the constitution of this sugar was
found to be

differing from diabetic sugar by an additional atom of water.

Pure crystallized sugar, according to the analysis of Liebig in 1834,
is composed of

By uniting the diabetic sugar with oxide of lead, it was found to
have combined with three atoms of oxide of lead, and to have lost three
atoms of water, constituting a trisaccharate of lead, composed of
                Carbon ....

    In this combination the diabetic sugar is therefore exactly isomeric
with common sugar, in its combination with two atoms of oxide of lead,
as determined by Berzelius.

    From the yellowish-brown solution which had yielded the trisaccha
rate of lead the addition of alcohol caused a flocky precipitate to fall,

which appeared, on analysis of a small quantity, to be disaccharate of

lead, containing

and Dr. Thomson supposes from sonic trials he made that the sugar in
this combination had lost two atoms of water, so as to be composed of

but the analysis requires repetition on a larger scale before any definite
conclusion on this particular subject can be drawn.

   It appears from the facts stated in this paper that there are three
species of sugar distinguished from each other by the quantity of wa

ter which they retain when heated to as high a temperature as they
can bear without decomposition ; viz. common sugar, which may be
deprived of one atom of water by combining with oxide of lead ; dia
betic sugar, which may in like manner be deprived of three atoms of
water ; and starch sugar, which by analogy may be presumed to be
capable of losing four atoms : so that all the species would, under

Ifthc3e conditions, become isomeric with anhydrous common sugar.

        these views have any solidity, it would appear that sugar, like
phosphoric acid, has in all cases the same constitution, and that the
three states of it depend upon the quantity of water and probably of
other bases with which it is disposed to combine.

    Common sugar combines with one atom of water, diabetic sugar

with three, and starch sugar with four. There is doubtless a fourth
variety of sugar, not yet discovered, capable of uniting with two atoms
of water.
    All the three species are capable of undergoing fermentation .and of
being resolved into 4 atoms carbonic acid and two atoms alcohol.

   Starch sugar has an excess of 2 atoms of water and diabetes sugar
of 1 atom ; while common sugar requires an atom of water to undergo

the decomposition.
   Dr. Thomson had previously mentioned that 39 65 grains of diabetes
sugar dried in vacuo over sulphuric acid, when exposed for 24 hours
to the heat of a steam-bath, lost 3-35 grains of moisture, and were of

course reduced to 36"3 grains.

But 36-3 : 3-35 : : 23-625 : 2-18.
It follows from this, that diabetes sugar dried over sulphuric acid is
deprived of two atoms of water when exposed to the heat of a steam-
bath or to 212°. The diabetes sugar, therefore, when in crystals, is
composed of
                                    = 9-
             12 atoms carbon

So that the atomic weight of the crystals of this sugar is 25*875, and
it can be deprived of 5 atoms of water by combining it with oxide of

lead.

   Dr. Thomson then noticed a. crystallized sugar obtained from diabetic
urine by Mr. Macgregor of Glasgow, by AmbrosianS and Maitland
from the serum of blood in diabetps, and by himself in urine in a case
of diabetes, 1827. This sugar was in 4-sided prisms of 110° and 70°,
white, translucent, sweetish, soluble in alcohol. This is believed by
Dr. Thomson to be a fourth kind of sugar, but having been interrupted
in his experiments upon it he recommends the subject to the attention
of chemists.

On Galactin. By Thomas Thomson, M.D., F.R.S., Professor of

This is a substance which constitutes the principal ingredient in the
sap of the Cow-tree, or Galactodendron utile of South America, which
is used as a substitute for cream. The sap, on standing, throws up a
white matter, soluble in boiling alcohol, but deposited as that liquid
cools. When well washed and dried, in vacuo, over sulphuric acid, it
constitutes galactin. It is yellow, translucent, brittle, has a resinous
aspect, and is tasteless. It is insoluble in water, but becomes white
and soft by imbibing that liquid. It is soluble in alcohol and ether.
This white compound becomes soft and ductile at 60°; at 117° it is
still solid, but at 137° it is liquid. Abundance of aqueous vapour is
driven off, but the galactin does not become translucent and yellow till
kept some time at 1 70°. The specific gravity of pure galactin is 0"969.

Notice  respecting the  native Diarseniate  of Lead. By Thomas                          Thom

         son, M.D.,     F.R.S., Professor

   During the last meeting of the British Association at Liverpool, a
mineral dealer from Cumberland exposed a collection of North of

England minerals for sale. Among others there was one labeled vana-
                                                                                    Dr. Thomson
diate of lead, from Caldbeck fell. On examining
            it

thought that differed too much, both in its colour and lustre, from
the true vanadiate of lead, of which he had been in possession for
some years, to be that mineral and, upon comparing with the vana

diate in his cabinet, this suspicion was confirmed.
             TRANSACTION'S OF THE SECTIONS.    -1/

    The Caldbeck fell mineral was in botryoidal concretions, upon
quartz. When examined by the microscope many of the nodules had
the aspect of cylinders.

   Colour honey yellow, similar to that of the Cornish arseniate of lead,
first described and analyzed by Mr. Gregor, but lighter, and much less
translucent.

    The lustre is resinous, and it has much greater brilliancy than speci
mens of vanadiate of lead.

The hardness is not easily determined, from the shape of the no
dules. Calcareous spar was not scratched by rubbing them against it
while selenite was scratched by them with great facility. The specific
gravity by two different trials was 7*272. This specific gravity is
decisive that the mineral is not vanadiate of lead, for the specific gra
vity of native crystals of vanadiate is only 6*663. The specific gravity
of Cornish arseniate of lead is still lower, being 6*41 .
   When exposed to a red heat on platinum foil it undergoes no altera
tion, except becoming a shade lighter in colour. Before the blow-pipe
on platinum it melts into a transparent globule, which assumes nearly
its original appearance on cooling, and does not crystallize like phos
phate of lead. On charcoal it gives out abundance of arsenical fumes,
when acted on by the blow -pipe, and a globule of metallic lead is ob

tained.

   It was analyzed twice in Dr. Thomson's laboratory, with every at
tention to accuracy, by Mr. Stenhouse. During the first analysis he
suspected the presence of a minute quantity of phosphoric acid ; but
he did not succeed in separating it from the arsenic, and of course the
actual existence of this acid in the mineral is still problematical. The

quantity is certainly very minute, and cannot amount to so much as
....half per cent., otherwise it would have been separable from the arsenic

acid.

    The two analyses were very similar : the following are the consti
tuents as determined by the second analysis, which Mr. Stenhouse
considers as most to be depended on :

The moisture and peroxide of iron are obviously accidental impuri
ties. The chloride of lead in 100 grains of the mineral amounts to
Ifabout half an atom, the arsenic acid to 2-J- atoms, and the oxide of lead
to 5 atoms.  we abstract the chloride of lead, which exists in nearly
the same proportion in phosphate of lead, vanadiate of lead, and arse
niate of lead, as in this mineral, the constituents are 1 atom arsenic acid,
and 2 atoms protoxide of lead. It is therefore a diarseniate of lead,
constituting a new species of lead ore, which has been met with

cimen of this mineral exhibits a deposit of yellow phosphate of lead
upon another side of the mass of quartz, upon which the diarseniate
has been deposited.

       On Emulsin. By Dr. T. Thomson and T. Richardson.

    Some years ago Robiquet and Boutron Charlard showed that volatile
oils of bitter almonds and prussic acid, which are obtained by the di
stillation of bitter almonds, do not exist naturally in almonds but re
sult from the process. They further ascertained that when milk of
bitter almonds, formed by triturating almonds with water in a mortar,
is treated with strong boiling alcohol, white crystals are deposited, on
cooling, which separate in larger quantity by concentration. To this
substance they gave the name of Amygdalin. Liebig and Wohler have
determined this body to be an amide of amygdalic acid, represented
by the following formula :

                           NsCwHH0M+H404

Subsequently, the investigation was continued by Wohler and Liebig,
who observed that when a solution of amygdalin is brought in contact
with a milk of sweet almonds, a most remarkable and peculiar action
takes place; prussic acid and oil of bitter almonds are formed, as in
the instance already mentioned. When milk of bitter almonds is distilled
without the artificial addition of amygdalin, besides prussic acid and
oil of bitter almonds, there is also formed sugar, which may be de
composed by fermentation. The solution after the termination of the
fermenting process affords a strong acid reaction which is not produced
by acetic acid or any other volatile acid. When alcohol is added and
the solution concentrated, thick white flocks are precipitated which
obviously contain no emulsin, because when dissolved in water they
have no action upon amygdalin. From these properties the flocks
would appear to be gum.

    The phenomena exhibited in the reaction described, which have
been termed Catalytic by Berzelius, resemble in a great measure those
which take place in fermentation ; and their investigation promises to
throw great light upon some of the most important processes of the
vegetable and animal ceconomy. With the view of assisting in the
elucidation of the subject, the authors have commenced with the ex
amination of the essential ingredient of the milk of sweet almonds which
has been termed emulsin.

    The process by which this substance was obtained was as follows.
Sweet almonds were triturated in a mortar and small portions of water
were gradually added until a milky fluid was obtained. This fluid was
mixed with four times its volume of ether and frequently agitated so

as to effect an intimate mixture. A clear fluid gradually separated at
the bottom of the stoppered bottle in which the experiment was made,
which in the course of three weeks was drawn off by means of a syphon.
This fluid was passed through n filter, and to one-half of the clear so

lution a large quantity of alcohol was added ; a copious precipitation
of white flocks ensued ; these were emulsin. From the other half the
emulsin was separated by bringing the solution to the boiling point,
when it precipitated in flocky coagula. The emulsin precipitated by
alcohol was carefully washed with alcohol, and then dried over sulphu
ric acid in the vacuum of an air-pump, to avoid the effects of heat. In
this state it possessed the following characters : it is a white powder,
destitute of taste and smell, soluble in water, insoluble in alcohol and

ether. When submitted to analysis in the usual way, the following
results were obtained :

   The fact of the existence of the substance operated on in the almonds

appears to be established by its acting on amygdalin in the same man
ner as the milk of almonds in the case alluded to in the commencement
of the paper. After numerous trials with various re-agents, its most
distinguished character was elicited by the phenomena exhibited when
boiled with barytes. During the whole of the boiling, which was con
tinued for above six hours, ammonia was slowly and continuously dis
engaged. Through the solution a current of carbonic acid was passed
and the whole filtered ; the clear solution was evaporated to dryness,
and the residual salt, which contained a large quantity of barytes, pos
sessed a strongly bitter taste, leading to the conclusion that emulsin
is an amide, and that the salt formed by the action of barytes is a com
pound of barytes with an acid which it is proposed to term emulsic
acid. From this fact the authors are inclined to infer that fibrin, ge

latin, casein, &c, are all amides.

        On a Neio ProcessBfyorHt.heL.ExPtaratcttiinosnono.f Silver from Lead.
    The object of this communication was to lay before the Association
an account of a discovery made by the author some time ago, the ap
plication of which to practice constitutes a new process in the arts, and

J.forms an important improvement in the extraction of silver from lead.

    Adopting the estimate of Mr. Taylor, in 1 828*, that the quantity
of lead raised annually in England and Wales amounts to 45,500 tons,
the author states that it all contains silver, in variable proportions, but
with so much of constancy in the proportion of silver in the lead ore of
each vein, that it is easy to arrive at a tolerably accurate knowledge of
the quantity of silver contained in the lead of each district.

   Of 22,000 tons of lead yielded in the district of Alston Moor, it is
believed that 16,000 tons contain silver at the rate of from 6 to 12 oz.
per ton, and 6000 from 3£ to 6 oz. per ton -- the average being about 5.

After observing this phenomenon once or twice, he began to conceive
that possibly some difference might be found in the proportions of sil

Accordingly, he divided a small quantity of lead into two portions,
by melting in crucible, and allowing to cool very slowly with con

   The lead used in the original experiment was what is considered rich
in silver; it contained 40 oz. 15 dwts. 8 grs. per ton, and was divided
into a crystallized portion, found to contain 25 oz. 4 dwts. 21 grs., and a
fluid portion, holding 79 oz. 1 1 dwts. 12 grs. per ton ; the latter being ne
cessarily much smaller than the former in quantity. The experiment
was repeated a great number of times upon lead of every variety as to
proportion of silver, with the same general result ; but being always per
formed in a crucible upon small quantities of lead, which of necessity
cooled quickly, the crystallized portion was never entirely deprived of
its silver, nor indeed reduced below two or three ounces per ton.

   It was not until the spring of the year 1833 that the author was con

veniently circumstanced to proceed in applying to practice the principle
he had developed ; but at that time his attention was again directed to
the subject, and he began by providing large pots of cast iron, in each

of which he could melt together and crystallize several tons of lead. All
the phenomena of crystallization in the large way were speedily observed,
which, with the mode of conducting the operation adopted then and since
continued without alteration, may be thus briefly described. Four or
five tons of lead being melted in one of the pots, the metal was carefully

freed, by skimming, from all dirt or oxide, and its surface made quite
clean ; it was then suffered to cool very slowly, care being taken to
break off and mix with the fluid mass, from time to time, any portion
that might congeal on the sides of the pot : when the temperature had
fallen sufficiently, small solid particles or crystals began to form, princi

pally upon the surface of the melted mass. These, if suffered to remain,

would have cohered together and formed a solid crust ; but being con
tinually struck, and the whole body of metal kept in motion by constant
stirring, they sunk down to the bottom of the pan, and soon appeared
in considerable quantity. By means of a perforated iron ladle, the cry-
stab were taken out of the pan from time to time as they formed, and
placed in another pot, the liquid lead being drained out of them as much
as possible, and suffered to flow back into the original pot. In this way
the operation was conducted until two-thirds or three-fourths of the ori
ginal lead was crystallized and withdrawn from the pot. The author
now found, as before, that the crystals always contained much less silver
than the lead from which they were formed ; but still he did not succeed
by one or even by two crystallizations, when operating with lead con
taining eight ounces of silver per ton, in making them sufficiently poor :
for instance, a pot filled with 8 ounce lead would yield at first crystals
holding from 1 to 2 ounces of silver ; in a little time, as the lead in
the pot became richer by receiving silver from the previously formed
crystals, it yielded crystals of 2 to 3 ounces ; and the crystals became
progressively richer, until, in the end, the original lead was divided into
three parts of crystalized lead holding about 4 ounces, and one part li
quid lead holding about 20 ounces per ton. Upon the lead of 4 ounces,
as well as upon the lead of 20 ounces, the operation might evidently be
repeated without limit, until the crystals became nearly free from silver
on the one hand, and the liquid lead exceedingly rich on the other ; but
this seemed to involve so much labour and delay, that the author was
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  53

most desirous of finding a mode by which the object could be accom

ifplished at once. Conceiving that the crystals would be rendered poorer

   more thoroughly drained from the liquid lead, he adopted the plan of
exposing them, after removal from ^he pot to a cautiously regulated
heat in the chamber of a reverberatory furnace, so as to melt out from
among them a further portion of liquid lead ; and in this way he suc
ceeded in obtaining at one operation from original lead holding 12
ounces of silver per ton, four parts of poor lead containing not more than
^ of an ounce per ton, and one part of rich lead containing 50 ounces
per ton, or thereabouts. This was effected at a moderate expense, and
with a very inconsiderable loss of lead ; and the new process thus ar
rived at, which he called the process of separation, was immediately
adopted and carried on in this way for some time at different lead-works
in the kingdom.

    The exposure of the crystals a second time to heat, required, how
ever, a peculiar and rather expensive apparatus, and was found somewhat
difficult to get managed properly, for the workmen could not always keep
the furnace in which it was performed at the exact temperature neces
sary for the operation ; and it often happened that, by the application
of too much heat, the crystals were melted entirely without being drained
of their richer lead ; besides, the lead exposed to heat in its crystallized
state was oxidized rapidly, and the subsequent reduction of the oxide
occasioned some loss of metal. These objections to the draining pro
cess induced the author to recommend in preference the simple plan of
repeated crystallization, which has been everywhere adopted, and now
constitutes the process of separation ; experience and practice have gra
dually rendered it easy and perfect, and it has become an established
operation among the arts of this country.

    The apparatus required for the separating process is exceedingly sim
ple, and consists merely of a number of nearly hemispherical iron pots,
each capable of holding about five tons of lead, the size for which is about
4 ft. diameter and 2 ft. 3 in. deep ; one or two smaller pots, 18 in. diameter
by 2 ft. deep, are required for the purpose of holding melted lead, in
which the perforated iron ladles are to be occasionally dipped to keep
them hot; and another pot, about 2 ft. 10 in. diameter by 1 ft. 10 in.
deep, for melting the ultimate poor lead to be cast into pieces. These,
with a few perforated iron ladles 15 in. diameter, and 5 in. deep, and
one or two whole ladles of lesser size for casting the melted lead
 into pigs, are the principal articles required. The large pots are to be
placed side by side in a line, each with a separate fire-place, (upon
which there must be an ash-pit door as well as a fire door,) and also with
 a separate flue and damper, so that the draught under each pot can be
entirely stopped by closing the flue with its damper, and the heat of the
 fire-place in some measure retained by shutting the ash-pit door. Above
the centre of this line of pots, at the height of six or eight feet, it is con
 venient to have a small iron railway, with a frame or carriage on four
 wheels to move backwards and forwards the whole length of the range
 of pots, from which is to depend a chain, terminated by a hook at the
 bottom, and reaching to nearly the top of the pots. This is for the
54 EIGHTH REPORT 1838.

purpose of more easily conveying the ladles filled with crystals from

pot to pot.

   All this being provided, one of the large pots is filled with lead, con

taining silver, say 10 oz. per ton, and after it is melted and skimmed,
the fire is withdrawn, the damper put down, and the ash-pit door

closed, when it cools and crystallizes as already described. Crystals,
as they are formed, are laded out into the second pot until about three-
quarters of the whole have been removed, which will contain about 5
ounces of silver per ton : upon this the operation is repeated, giving lead
2 ounces ; and by a third crystallization, there is obtained from this,
poor lead, holding not more than 10 to 15 dwts. of silver per ton,
which is cast into pieces for sale as separated lead. The rich lead, on
the other hand, is collected and repeatedly crystallized, until it is made
to contain 200 or 300 ounces per ton, after which the silver is extracted
by cupellation. In working, the different pots at each stage are filled
up always with lead of the same content of silver before beginning to
crystallize, and a greater or less amount of crystals taken out, as the
operator may think fit, in which respect the practice differs almost at
every establishment ; but the process is so very simple and the mode
of proceeding so obvious, that it is unnecessary to give a more minute
detail.

   By operating in the way described, it is evident that but a very small
portion of lead is made to undergo the process of cupellation, not more
than one twentieth part, when 10 ounces of lead is enriched to 200

ounces by repeated crystallization ; and as the loss by separation has
not been found to exceed a 250th part of the whole lead, the loss by

lation, so that by the reduction of expense and the reduction of loss of
lead, the extraction of silver is so far economized that 3 ounces per
ton will now fully cover the whole charge.
   By this reduction of the cost of extracting the silver, all the lead of

Alston Moor (22,000 tons), Devon, Cornwall, and West Cumberland
(2000), and the lead of North Wales (12,000), making a total of
36,000 tons per annum, can now be made to yield up its silver with ad
vantage, so that on the very low average of 6 ounces per ton, at least
54,000 ounces of silver per annum are gained by the arts. There may
also be safely estimated a reduction of the loss of lead on the 18,000
tons generally refined by cupellation of at least 300 tons. The lead
obtained by separation is much improved in quality, being more soft
and ductile than ordinary lead.
It only remains to consider, how it happens that lead in the act of
consolidation gives up a portion of its silver to the surrounding and
still fluid lead ; and the most simple view of the matter undoubtedly,

This reasoning the author endeavoured to confirm by illustrationsaa

ascertain the degree in which, by cautiously regulated heat, silver
may be separated from lead by the process of eliquation. Pieces of
lead were most cautiously heated till a few drops of fused metal oozed
out from their pores this was found to be slightly richer in silver than

Becquerel has proved that a homogeneous metallic surface exposed
to the action of a given fluid will assume a state of electric tension,
provided that the fluid in which it is immersed is of different degrees
of concentration in two different layers, so that the plate may become
unequally acted upon at two different points. The crystallization of
protoxide of copper by the immersion of a plate of that metal in a so
lution of its nitrate, some of the black oxide being placed in the lower
part of the                               example of this circumstance. But
              vessel, affords a familiar  quoad its degree of concentration,
if the fluid   remains homogeneous,

no action, so far as electricity is concerned, ensues, unless one portion
of the metallic surface immersed is in a condition which enables it to be

more readily acted on than the other. This may be effected by partial
and superficial oxidation, by roughening or burnishing part of the me
tallic surface, or by the induction of that peculiar passive state which

Schonbein has shown to exist in some metals under certain circum

stances.

  If a plate of metallic copper is made the negative electrode of a single

pair, acting on a solution of copper, crystallization of the latter metal,
often in delicate, rosette-like patches, if the current is weak, ensues.
This deposition generally takes place at the lower part of the metallic
plate, leaving the upper onp smooth and free from crystals. A plate
thus prepared is in a condition to assume two different electric states
on immersion in a homogeneous fluid, in consequence of the delicate
crystals of metallic copper undergoing oxidation more readily than the
smooth part of the plate. Such a piece of metal was immersed in a so
lution of common salt during three months in a dark closet ; on ex
amining the plate at the end of that time, the smooth portion, on which
no metallic crystals had been deposited, was found tarnished and covered
with blackish patches, without any perceptible roughening of the sur
face. The lower portion of the same plate on which the copper had
crystallized had undergone a very interesting change, the metallic
crystals having become replaced by an infinite number of hemispheri

cal patches from a mere point to the size of a large pin's head, of a rich
green colour, of a somewhat velvety or satiny lustre. On breaking
some of the crystals they were found to be radiated like zoolite, without
any metallic nucleus, and firmly adhering to the copper on which they
were deposited. The crystals were insoluble in water, did not effervesce
with sulphuric or nitric acids, in which they were with difficulty solu
ble, the solution being at first brownish, and readily becoming green by
exposure to the air : their solution, in dilute nitric acid, precipitated
nitrate of silver. These hemispheric-radiated crystals are therefore re
garded by Dr. Bird as a basic chloride, probably resembling the native
tribasic chloride. This, however, he has not yet had an opportunity of
proving by direct analysis.

   The theory of the formation of these crystals appears to be very
simple. On immersing the copper plate into the brine, its electricity
became disturbed, and two states of electric tension were assumed, the

smooth and polished part becoming the negative, and the rough and
crystalline portion the positive electrode of a simple voltaic circle. The
chloride of sodium becoming decomposed, the chlorine uniting with
the crystalline surface of the positive electrode, the soda being at first
set free, although probably almost immediately after re-acting on the
newly-formed copper salt, and thus reducing it to the state of basic
chloride, the crystalline deposition resulted from the slowness of the
action, as in Becquerel's experiments.

By    Golding Bird,

   At the last meeting of the Association Dr. Bird presented some re
marks on the possibility of reducing metallic bases on surfaces not in

contact with the electrode*. During the past year he has varied his
experiments, chiefly with a view to the prevention of any source of
fallacy connected with accidental metallic contact; and, although
he has repeatedly succeeded in reducing metals on, or in the cen
tre of masses of earthy substances, as plaster of Paris or clay, he
has never yet obtained metallic deposits in a fluid intermediate be
tween electrodes when these substances were absent. An interesting
modification of the apparatus, described at Liverpool, has been con
trived by Mr. Sandall, chemical assistant at St. Thomas's hospital,
whilst engaged in constructing a voltaic battery on Prof. Daniell's ar
rangement, but in which the membranes should be replaced by cylin
ders of sulphate of lime. This gentleman carried on his experiments
during this summer, and Dr. Golding Bird requested him to break up
the masses of plaster that had been used in his arrangement, for the
purpose of ascertaining whether any deposition of metallic' copper had
taken place at any part not in connexion with the metallic surfaces, as

                          * See vol. vi., p. 45.

he considered these results would go far to support or refute the opi
nions he had hazarded on this subject.
   The results of these experiments were uniform ; they differed from
Dr. Bird's in one remarkable circumstance, viz. that the copper, instead
of being deposited in a crystalline form, was in nodular or tubercular
                        exhibited                     When the plaster of
masses (a specimen was  of course  to the Section).
Paris diaphragm, which             was vertical, was  carefully made, and

one side of a jar thus divided was filled with water, and the other with
a solution of sulphate of copper, no intermixture of fluids was evident
even at the end of a month. On placing in the solution of sulphate
of copper, at a certain distance from the vertical partition, a mass of
copper pyrites, connected by a copper ribbon with a piece of zinc im
mersed in the water in the other cell, voltaic action slowly commenced.

At the end of a few days the water in the zinc cell became acid, bub

bles of hydrogen gradually appeared, and were slowly evolved, whilst
the copper pyrites slowly assumed the iridescent appearance of peacock-
ore described by Mr. Fox : in a month the apparatus was dismounted ;
no trace of sulphate of copper was found in the water cell, and neither
the zinc nor the mass of pyrites had touched the plaster diaphragm.
On removing the latter, a copious deposition of firmly adherent me
tallic copper, in a nodular or almost stalagmitic form, was found on that
surface which had been exposed to the metallic solution ; and, on
breaking the mass of plaster transversely, numerous delicate veins of
copper appeared permeating it in every direction. This experiment is
considered by Dr. Bird to be less liable to sources of fallacy, and
much less exceptionable than those described by him last year ; for,
not only is all metallic contact with the plaster diaphragm carefully
avoided, but the very form of the reduced copper would afford an ar
gument against its being furnished by portions shooting off from the
negative electrode, on the beautifully iridescent surface of which,
moreover, no trace of reduced copper had appeared.

before, while the oxy chloride of antimony, re-dissolved in hydrochloric
acid, gave scarcely any blue tint whatever ; and the slight one which
it did yield was evidently owing to the adhesion of a small portion of
peroxide of iron precipitated with it ; for, again precipitating with water

were rendered perfectly colourless by half an ounce of water, while
three ounces of colourless hydrochloric acid acquired a considerable

   The author of this paper has examined chemically a large number
of specimens of commercial caustic potass, with a view to determine
the reality of the cause usually assigned to the deep green colour
of its aqueous solutions, namely, the presence of manganese, in the
state of manganesiate of potass. The colour of these solutions gra

meleon. On careful analysis, however, the author has assured himself
that manganese does not occur as a constituent of caustic potass, and
that its aqueous solutions owe their colour, and the change of their
colour, to the presence of protoxide and proto-chloride of iron in solu
tion ; the former being held so by the presence of chloride of potas
sium. These, by taking up oxygen (probably from the air combined
with the water), become further oxydized and gradually precipitate in
combination, leaving the solution colourless, and giving rise to a new
compound of sesquioxide and sesquichloride of iron, consisting, by the
author's analysis, of 10 atoms of the former and one of the latter body,
or

                            (Fe, Cl3) + 10 (Fe4 0,).

It is anhydrous. Having observed that these changes took place
at very different rates in bottles of variously coloured glass, the
author commenced a series of experiments on the relative effects of

light transmitted to the solution through various media, and has found
and recorded in ruled sheets, by curves, the results of observations
made every two hours. In these curves, the ordinates represent time,
and the abscissae the rate of chemical change, as marked by certain
changes of colour.

   Means were taken to prevent inequality of temperature, or of inten

 The rate of progressive decoloration for different rays at different pe

     The result as to green glass agrees with Mrs. Somerville's experi
ments. Ink, which Sir John Herchel found transmitted white light
unaltered, was used to reduce all the coloured media to the same illu

minating power, and immersion in water to preserve the temperature
constant.

    The author conceives that this is the first attempt that has been
made to reduce the phenomena of the chemical action of light to nu

upon which so little was known, and in which the observed cases were
so few.

   Having occasion some months ago to make a quantity of the " So
lution of Sesquicarbonate of Ammonia," of the London Pharmacopoeia,
the author found, (without knowing that Dr. Dalton had done so be
fore,) by pouring successively small portions of pure water on large
quantities of the salt, that saturated solutions were obtained, success
ively decreasing in specific gravity, and smelling less and less of
ammonia, till all the salt was dissolved. He agrees with Dr. Dalton
in opinion, that the commercial carbonate of ammonia is not a homo
geneous salt, not a sesquicarbonate of ammonia, but a mixture of car
bonate and bicarbonate, of which the former is first dissolved by the
water. The irregular masses of salt which remain still retain, almost
exactly, their original form and dimensions -- they are, in point of fact,
skeletons of the original mass, but consist solely of a congeries of cry
stals of bicarbonate of ammonia, from the interstices of which carbo
nate of ammonia has   been removed by the solvent power of the water,
                      so far as to dissolve all. What takes place here,
if we do not proceed
may be likened, in some measure, to the case in which the gelatin is
removed from bone by water, leaving the phosphate of lime. Inde
pendently of showing the true nature of the salt, this is of some im
portance, as it affords us a very ready mode of preparing bicarbonate
of ammonia without the waste, which occurs by exposure of the com
mercial salt in powder to the air, or without the trouble of transmitting
a current of carbonic acid gas through its solution, as directed by the
Dublin Pharmacopoeia. Indeed, the latter method is both troublesome
and wasteful, for it is difficult to evaporate a solution of bicarbonate of
ammonia without decomposition. Mr. Scanlan has found that water at
90° or 100° decomposes bicarbonate of ammonia, setting carbonic acid

at liberty.

On the Blackening of Nitrate of Silver by Light. By Mr. Scanlan.

water contain a trace of organic matter, it will become blackened.
Mr. Fergusson, some years ago, when he had the management of the

chemical laboratory belonging to the Dublin Apothecaries Company,
informed Mr. Scanlan, that perfectly pure nitrate of silver is not
blackened by long exposure to direct sunlight, but it is believed that
he never gave further publicity to this fact than mentioning it to his
chemical friends in Dublin at the time. In consequence of some
observations upon the blackening of this salt, made by Dr. Aldridge,
of Dublin, in his review of Mr. Phillips's translation of the London

nitrate of silver, immediately they were cast, from the mould, and
wrapped one of them in paper, in the usual way that this substance is
found in the shops; the other cylinder was transferred to a glass tube,
and sealed up hermetically, by means of the blow-pipe, without being

ofsuffered to come in contact with organic bodies : it was pushed from

the mould into the tube by means of a glass rod. After a lapse
three days, the paper was removed from the first, and it was then
sealed up in a tube, in a similar manner to the other. The two tubes
were now exposed to the direct rays of the sun, and in half an hour the
nitrate of silver that had laiu in contact with paper was blackened, while

that in the other tube was not altered by six weeks constant exposure.
The whole amount of blackening of the cylinder that had been papered
was produced in the half hour. Nitrate of silver, free from organized
matter, is sometimes blackened by exposure to the air; but this may be
owing to the presence perhaps of sulphuretted hydrogen, accidentally
       ;                                 perhaps, seldom free from organic

theory of physics on questions relating to the combination of atoms,
which he classes according to their supposed absolute forces and rela

construction of a general table of specific gravities for chemical com
pounds in the gaseous form. Taking the specific gravity of air as

         bodies which still remain. By

   Mr. Exley points out in this paper the application of his theory to
the explanation of those cases in chemistry where powerful affinities
between bodies are brought into activity by means of other substances
which are present and continue to exercise the same energies. Berze-

lius attributes this to a peculiar force, which he calls catalytic, and Mr.

Exley takes four examples to show how these phenomena receive an ex
planation in conformity with his general view of atomic centres of force.
   The first case is that of the combination  o"f
effected by the presence of clean platinum.        hydrogen and oxygen,
                                                   Since metals are simple

bodies and dense solids, the theory recognises their atoms as having
small spheres of repulsion, and those of platinum must     abtemovseprhyersemaollf
because of the great density of the metal : hence, the

ethereal matter belonging to this metal is very dense, being more dense
as the square of the radius of the sphere of repulsion is less and as the
atomic weight is greater. For this reason the oxygen can approach ex
tremely near to the atoms of platinum, and yet not combine with thein
by reason of that dense atmosphere ; and the hydrogen being drawn
close on them the reunion in question occurs, the generated steam
escapes, heat is evolved, and the process advances till ignition is pro

duced."

The author examines in succession three other cases of supposed

peculiar actions, and explains them on the principles of his theory :
       The conversion of starch into sugar by the action of a weak solu

   tion of sulphuric acid.
    The conversion of sugar into alcohol by the action of barm.
    The conversion of alcohol into ether by the action of sulphuric

acid.

On an Improvement in the Manufacture of Iron,      by the  JAophpnlicaStaiomnueolf
Gas obtained from the  decomposition   of Water.
Dawes, of Bromford     and Oldbtiry   Ironworks,     By    Birmingham.

                                                    near

   Mr. Dawes has attempted to obtain a heating effect approaching in
intensity to that which is produced by the oxy-hydrogen blow-pipe, but
upon a scale sufficiently large to be available in the smelting of iron.

    Hydrogen gas, in addition to its great inflammability, exhibits, when
applied to the above purpose, a purifying property in a high degree, so
that the most sulphurous materials may be used with advantage, and

metal of good quality be produced. There can be little doubt (Mr.
Dawes thinks) as to the value of hydrogen thus applied ; the question

would rather be, Can the gas be obtained at a sufficiently cheap rate so
as to make the use of it profitable ? This, he thinks, may now be con
fidently answered in the affirmative. The method of proceeding is as
follows. Jet< of steam are made to pass through red-hot cast-iron
pipes filled with small coke or charcoal ; (the riddlings from the coke
hearth answer the purpose, and are of little value ;) decomposition

immediately takes place. The carbon of the coke combines with the
oxygen of the steam, forming, in the first instance, carbonic acid,
which, by passing on through a further portion of the red-hot carbon,
is converted into carbonic oxide ; the hydrogen gas, together with the
oxide before-mentioned, is applied to the furnace by means of a jet
inserted within the blast-pipe tongue ; the pressure upon the gas, of
course, being equal to that upon the blast. The pipes require to be
replenished with the brays about every twelve hours, which is con
veniently effected by means of a plug fitted to the top of each of them.
At first some diffnculty arose from destruction of the pipes ; but as
the melting point of cast-iron is so much higher than the temperature
required to decompose water, it was evident that the cause of the mis
chief lay in the construction of the heating furnace. This has been
remedied, and the apparatus seems now to be very durable. The pre

sent one at Oldbury has been in operation for some months, and the
pipes are apparently little the worse for wear. The quantity of fuel
required to keep them hot is from twelve to fifteen cwt. of small coal
for twelve hours ; and as the steam is obtained from the engine-boilers,
and the fireman of the hot-air apparatus has time enough to attend to
it,  the expense, with the exception of wear and tear, a mere trifle.
                                                is
The wear and tear, in every probability, will be very moderate, andit

Mr. Dawes has sufficient reason to conclude that the cost will not be
more than three or four shillings for every hundred thousand feet of
gas, every foot of which is, of course, equivalent to a certain quantity
of fuel. Various experiments have now shown not only that the qua
lity of the iron very much improved by this process, but that the
     is

producing power of the furnace, at the same time, has greatly increased.
In conclusion, Mr. Dawes observes, that any advantages
                                                                   may be

     On the Influence  of  Voltaic Combination on Chemical Action.

                           By Dr. Andrews.

   In dilute sulphuric acid, composed of one atom of the dry acid andaais
eight atoms of water, the solution of distilled zinc permanently acceitisis
lerated, by connecting with plate of platina, immersed in the same
liquid, so as to form voltaic combination. In acid, containing sevena
atoms of water, the ordinary action at first increased, and afterwards
rather diminished by contact with platina. But when zinc heated in
acid, containing less than this quantity of water, the connexion with
platina transfers the evolution of gas, from the surface of the positive
to that of the negative metal, and at the same time diminishes its
quantity, and consequently retards the rate of solution of the zinc.
The formation of a galvanic circle exerts, therefore, reverse effect on
the solution of zinc in sulphuric acid containing more or less than
seven atoms of water. The principal circumstances which influence
these results are the adhesion of the hydrogen gas to the surface of the
   70 EIGHTH REPORT -- 1838.

   zinc ; the formation of sulphate of zinc, which is greatly facilitated by
   the presence of seven atoms of water in union with each atom of acid
                           the number of atoms of     water of crystallization contained
   (that  being            lastly, the proper action  of the voltaic circle, which tends

                          ;
   to diminish the solution of the zinc. In dilute acid, the first circum

   stance retards the action on the zinc alone, and the second facilitates

   its solution then the platina surface enables the hydrogen to escape.
   But in the stronger acid, the voltaic association impedes the solution
   of the zinc, partly from the evolution of gas being transferred to the
   platina, and thus the saturated liquid being allowed to accumulate
   around the zinc plate, and partly from the real effect of the galvanic

   nish the chemical action of the solution on the electro-positive metal,

   the author endeavoured to show, from the consideration, that in or

   dinary solution the electricities thus developed have only an indefi
   nitely small portion of liquid to traverse, while in voltaic solution their
   reunion can only be effected by passing across column of variable ex
   tent, and composed of an imperfectly conducting substance. And, as
   the action greater the nearer the plates are to each other, that action
          of

              is

                              of
   ought to attain a maximum when the distance between the plates

   vanishes, provided this condition could actually be realized.

        On a New Process for Tanning. By William Herapath.

   The author, after noticing the impediments to a perfect accomplish
ment of the three great objects of the tanner, viz. to make the skins of

animals insoluble, imputrescible, and impermeable to water, describes a
new process, by which these objects are accomplished at a less cost
than that of the old methods. In the ordinary process, the harder

fibres of the skin are perfectly tanned ; but the gelatine, which, if re
tained, would be of the greatest value in rendering leather imperme
able to water, disappears from the product, or is seen as an injurious
yellow coat on the surface. In reasoning on the difficulties experienced
by tanners, Mr. Herapath was brought to the conclusion that they were
occasioned by the force of capillary attraction ; and finding that the or
dinary modes of applying pressure, handling, &c. were expensive and in
sufficient, he determined to try the effect of rolling the hides, connected

rollers, and then returned again into the pit for a fresh supply
of tanning liquor; such liquor becomes exhausted, about two degrees
of the barktrometer, in twenty-four hours, when it is pumped to
the next pit backwards of the series ; and, by the time it arrives at the
last pit, (eight days,) it will have lost from 16 to 20 degrees by the
same instrument. The eight pairs of rollers require one-horse power
to work them, and two boys of 2s. 6d. a week each to superintend
them ; when two bands or one hundred hides will be taken off weekly,
as one month is sufficient for them to be on the rollers. They are now
              strong solutions for another month, when they

    On some New Salts of Mercury. By William West, Leeds.

   This paper describes the composition and properties of some salts,
composed of bicyanide of mercury, with the haloid salts of potassium.

   As these salts had, without Mr. West's knowledge, been previously
formed by other chemists, it is unnecessary to detail his experiments,
which confirm former researches as to their composition. The author
observed that the pearly lustre of some of these crystals, especially those
from the bromide, was such that they might probably be employed in
place of the scales of the Bleak, for the manufacture of artificial pearls.

On a New Compound of Carbon and Hydrogen. By William

   Maugham, Lecturer on Chemistry at the Royal Gallery of Practi
   cal Science, London.

   The compound in question is produced when the electrodes of a vol
taic battery are armed with charcoal points, and these points introduced
into a vessel of distilled water. The points should be attached to the
copper-wire electrodes by means of platinum wires. On bringing the
charcoal points together under the water, so as to produce the elec
trical spark with as little interruption as possible, the water undergoes
decomposition, carbonic oxide is produced, and a compound, not pre
viously noticed, consisting of carbon and hydrogen, is at the same time
formed. Neither hydrogen nor oxygen gases are obtained as happens
when the action is electrolytic.

   The compound under consideration is of an oily nature ; it imparts
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                        73

a very peculiar and unpleasant odour to the water, which becomes im
pregnated with it as it is formed ; when kept for some time the liquid
loses its odour, and there is a precipitate of carbonaceous matter. This
spontaneous change takes place whether the liquid be exposed to the
air or kept in a stoppered phial.

an Attempt to liquefy  BHyydWroiglelinamandMaOuxgygheanm,GaLseecst,urwerithonaccCohme
panying Apparatus.
mistry, Royal Gallery of Practical Science, London.

   The apparatus consists of a strong glass tube, bent in the form of the
letter U, having a platinum wire attached to a brass cap passing into each
leg. The glass tube is ground at each end, and the ground surface of
the brass cap is held down by means of screws, a collar of leather being
interposed to make the whole air-tight. Water being introduced into

the tube, and the tube closed, the wires are to be attached to the elec

trodes of a sustaining battery. The water theu undergoes decomposi
tion, and the oxygen and hydrogen gases evolved are retained in the
tube, the pressure on the gases being increased in proportion to the
time the action is going on.

    The pressure thus obtained may be carried to such an extent as to
burst the strongest glass tubes that have yet been employed in the ex

periment.

   By making the experiment with the assistance of cold, the author of
the paper anticipates that both hydrogen and oxygen may be liquefied.

    The tube is not to be completely filled with water, and it will be ne
cessary to have the water slightly acidulated with sulphuric acid.

    Should we not be able to succeed in liquefying hydrogen, oxygen,
&c, we have, nevertheless, a mode of obtaining increased gaseous press
ure, which, with a slight modification of the apparatus, that will readily
suggest itself to those experienced in manipulation, will enable us to
liquefy those bodies which pass from the aeriform to the liquid state at
comparatively low pressures. The same process may also be rendered
available for other purposes, where increased pressure becomes re

quisite.

   On the Water of the Dead Sea. By John Murray, F.L.S. fyc.
   Having had an opportunity of examining chemically the waters of the

Dead Sea, the author discovered several substances which he supposes
to have escaped the attention of those chemists who have already sub
mitted them to analysis. He described the effect of many re-agents in
testing the constitution of the water, which exhibited, after repose,
strong signs of sulphuretted hydrogen. There was no trace of iron. In
addition to lime, magnesia, sulphur, &c, the substances which the au
thor supposes himself to have been the first to detect in this celebrated

water are, iodine, boracic acid, ammonia, silica, selenium, lie also
found bromine. The waters of the Jordan are strongly contrasted with
those of the Dead Sea ; for they yielded to Mr. Murray only minute
traces of lime and magnesia and muriate of soda.

   In this communication Lieut. Morrison repeats the assurance that in
the instrument of his invention the magnet deflects to the east when
the air is positively electrified, and to the west when negatively elec
trified.

   He also states the results of some examinations of the action of the
instrument, made to determine the validity of an opinion which had
been advanced, that the deflections in this instrument depend on the
hygrometric state of the suspending string. The author declares that
the same phenomena happen when a fine silver wire is used instead of
the string.

On t/te Production of Crystals of Silver. By Thos. E. Blackwall.

    Having observed nearly two years since in his writing-desk, some
small crystals of silver which were firmly fixed upon a green substance
like malachite, the author inferred, from seeing also a piece of brass in
his desk, which fitted to the green mass, that there had been galvanic
action generated by the zinc and copper of the brass, and that by its
influence the nitrate of silver had been decomposed, and thus the silver
crystals formed.

   He describes experiments which he had instituted to test the truth
of this view, and mentions the production of very similar crystals by
the aid of corresponding metallic combinations.

            been  found impracticable, without the aid of engravings from

these beautiful and valuable drawings, to convey any proper notion,
within moderate limits, of the mass of curious facts made known by
this communication. It appears, indeed, the less necessary to attempt
an analysis of Mr. Buddie's Essay, since it is understood that the
author proposes to communicate it to the Natural History Society of
Northumberland, Durham, and Newcastle on-Tyne, to whose Trans
actions he has previously consigned several important sections of the
strata of the Newcastle coal-field. The following passages are ex
trac"teOdn  from the first section  of the memoir.
            referring to the line   of the crop of the  coal,  and  the  line  of the
axis of the general dip of the strata, it would appear that this field of
coal, so far as it has hitherto been explored, although traversed by
various undulations and large faults, forms only a portion of an im
mense trough or basin, the south-western, western, and northern mar
gins of which we have yet only been able to trace. But as the strata,
so far as they have yet been explored, in the line of the dip under the

magnesian limestone, are conformable, there is reason to conclude that
                   of coal
the seams                   extend  far   under the German Ocean         before   they,

            great    many seams of coal   are   found in  this extensive
                                                                          district,

but they differ in number, character, quality, and thickness, in its
several portions, and it is seldom that more than five of workable
thickness co-exist, and it frequently     happens that not more, than one
or two occur in the same locality.
                                            In Monkwearmouth colliery, for
example, we find 31 seams of coal sunk through in a depth of 264'
fathoms 4- feet 9 inches, containing an aggregate thickness of 47 feet
2 inches of coal, (including the foreign substances with which the
several seams are interstratified,) only one of which has yet been found
of workable thickness and merchantable quality. Those seams vary
in thickness from an inch and a half to 6 feet 2 inches and a half. In

Backworth Colliery 283 beds have been sunk and bored through within
a depth of 206 fathoms 0 feet 1 1 inches from the surface, comprising
45 seams of coal, of the aggregate thickness of 60 feet 1 inch, inclu

ding the foreign substances with which the coal is interstratified. Of

these seams. only two or three can be considered of workable thickness

at the present era."
    It appears that the coal seams of the Newcastle district are very

about N. 80° E. by compass. From Felling Colliery, towards the
N. E., it traverses Walker, Hebbarn, Bewick, Percy Main, and Colling-
wood collieries, to the outcrop of the seam near North Shields ; and in
the S.W. direction from Felling Colliery, it passes through Sheriff

                     band first  shows

   rally at about 10 inches above the Black-band, which is incidental to
   the seam. By almost imperceptible degrees it goes on increasing till
   it reaches the thickness of 3 inches, and becomes a confirmed slate
   band of a dark gray colour. A little before it attains this thickness, a
   three-inch layer of coarse ' brassy coal,' (coal mixed with iron pyrites),
   appears at the bottom of the under division of the seam, separating it
   from the bottom coal; and it is worthy of remark, that this layer of
   ' brassy ' coal almost invariably accompanies the Heworth Band. From

   3 inches in thickness the band goes on thickening more rapidly to 12
   inches, alter which it goes on in a still more rapid ratio to 10 and 12
                                                         it goes southward."
   fee"t  ; finally dividing and destroying the seam as  12 inches, it changes
          When the band approaches the thickness of

   to a much lighter hue, and increases in hardness ; and as it goes on
   thickening it becomes arenaceous, and finally passes into a stratum of
   sandstone, 7 fathoms thick, in one of the pits of Washington Colliery,
   while in another of the pits of the same, colliery, it forms a variety of
   beds of sandstone and gray and black metal stone."
   Considering the extent of the Newcastle coal-field, but few whin
   dykes occur, as only three or four of any considerable magnitude have
   yet been discovered. These are the Coaly Hill, the Hamsterly Com
   mon or HettDyke, the Cockfield Fell Dyke, and the Acklington Dyke.
   The first of these dykes is the subject of a notice of Mr. Buddie in the
   Transactions of the Natural History Society of Northumberland, Dur
   ham, and Newcastle on Tyne, (vol. i.,) and it is remarkable for its
   undulatory character and its limited vertical depth. In fact, levels
   have been driven across the presumed plane of its fissure, both above
   and below the really existing vertical mass of whin-rock ; of this Mr.
   Buddie furnishes ample proof from colliery workings, which also dis
   close the curious vertical divisions which exist in the dyke.
      The dislocations of the strata called ' slip dykes,' or ' faults,' are
   infinitely more numerous than whin dykes in the great coal-fields of
   the Tyne and Wear. All the principal faults and whin dykes were
   represented by Mr. Buddie on a map, and minutely described in the
   paper from documents of the most undoubted accuracy. Accurate
   sections illustrating these phenomena, were drawn on a magnificent
   scale, and have been copied in a reduced form for publication along
   with the original memoir, which is expected to appear in the Newcastle
   Transactions, already rich in contributions to the geology of the coal
   formation of the Tyne and Wear, from the stores gathered in Mr. Bud

   die's extensive mining experience.

TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  77

sandstones, limestones, coal, and the strata usually existing in all coal
fields. They underlie the millstone grit rocks which crop out at Ale-
mouth, and they overlie thick beds of a red conglomerate, accompanied
by slaty red sandstones, which rest on the Lammermuir Hills towards
the north, and on the Cheviot towards the west. There are altogether
fourteen beds of workable coal, the thickest of which contain about six
feet of pure coal. There are seven beds of marine limestone, each on
an average fifteen feet thick. This coal field is intersected by four
greenstone dykes, all of which run in a direction E. and W., and all of
which become thinner towards the west ; two of them run severally
about eight miles. The Kyloe hills consist of greenstone, which is
stratified, and forms part of the whin sill that runs through Northum
berland. The strata are in the form of a basin, having been elevated
on two sides by the porphyry of Lamberton and Cheviot hills. But the
phenomena of the district afford clear evidence that there have been
two' periods when the porphyry was ejected, one of these periods being
before the deposition of the stratified rocks, and the other after the de
position. This evidence is afforded by the conglomerate under the coal-

amnedasCurheesv, iowthpicohrpihnyrmieasn,y--palancdesbyctohnetavinesrticfraalgilymeonftstheosfethceoaLl a-mmebaesrutroens

in other places where they are in contact with the porphyry. The
slips or dislocations caused by these convulsions were pointed out and
described, with reference to a map and sections. The direction of these
slips was stated to be generally coincident with the dip and rise of the
strata, so that where the strata dip the same way continuously over a
great extent of country, they are all parallel ; and where they are in the
form of a basin, they converge to the trough of it.

  It was mentioned, that organic remains of various kinds were found

in the strata of the district. Remains of fish, and of the same species
that occur in the Lothian coal fields, viz. the Megalichthys and the
Gyracanthus, occur in an impure limestone that forms the roof of the
lowest workable coal, which limestone contains also terrestrial plants

and bivalve shells, resembling the Sanguinolaria. Lower down in the
series, and near what was probably the shore of the sea in which these
strata were deposited, the shales and sandstones exhibit broken frag
ments of Coniferse and other plants having Serpulce and Modiolte at
tached to them. The workable beds of limestone are filled with all the

marine shells usually characteristic of the carboniferous limestones.
   The superficial deposits consist of bowlder clay which immediately

covers the rocks, and is filled with blocks of grauwacke, basalt, and
granite, clearly showing that it has come from the westward. This
bowlder clay is covered by sand, which in some places is sixty feet deep
and is continuous for many miles. Over this lies fine brick clay ; and
above the sand is a covering of gravel. It would appear from this,
that a sea had probably existed in the district, at the bottom of which
the bowlder clay, by some violent cause, had been spread, that a long
period of tranquillity thereafter prevailed, when at length the sea re
tired, whereby gravel was spread over its bottom, and the existing
valleys (which are all east and west in direction) were scooped out.

On the Red Sandstone  of  tlie Tweed and  Carlisle.      By Nicholas

                          Wood, F.G.S.

   The author, referring to his memoir in the Transactions of the Natural
History Society of Newcastle, described the inclined beds of red sand
stone which rise out from under the mountain-limestone series on the
sea coast, about a mile south of the Tweed. He stated his belief that
these beds flatten towards the west, so as to form the great deposit of red
sandstone of the Tweed, and supported this opinion by a section from
Berwick to the porphyritic hills of the Cheviot range near Barmouth.
In the line of this section the relation of the red sandstone in ques
tion to subjacent coal-beds and overlying shales of the limestone series
is clearly seen, and the flattening of the strata previously alluded to is
witnessed at many points. The most conclusive evidence on this subject
is obtained at the coal-workings on the south side of the Tweed. Near
                      the porphyritic rocks south of Barmouth,

sandstones assume

all his inquiries Mr. Wood infers that the beds of red sandstone of the

Tweed are referable to the series lying immediately below the moun
tain limestone and reposing upon the old red sandstone.
         second part of the paper
   The   north side of the ' (Jreat  was illustrated  by a section   on the line
of the                               Dyke ' from the   sea-side at  Cullercoats
near Newcastle to Croglin-fell in Cumberland, showing the position of
the detached western coal-fields of Stublick, Hartley Burn, Midge-
holme, &c. From Midgeholme the strata rise rapidly west, so that the

limestone rocks come to the day, and one included coal seam is worked
in Tindal-fell, and at Talkin, and crops out on the escarpment of Crog
lin-fell. Below this coal-bed appears a series of limestones, the ' whin
sill,' a second layer of basalt, limestones and sandstones, and, in some
of the deep ravines, beds of red sandstone lying underneath the lime

stones.

The author compares with this mighty escarpment of the carboniferous

limestone, thus based on red sandstone, the analogous and probably con
temporaneous section of Tweeddale, and further declares his conviction
that the vale of the Eden as well as the vale of the Tweed rests on red
sandstones, which rise from beneath the escarpments of limestone. In
support of this opinion he states that the red sandstones of Cumber
land and the Tweed are very similar, and that they occupy precisely
the same relative geographical position to the series of neighbouring

mountain limestones.

The coal of Sanquhar and Cannoby was noticed in connexion with

this subject ; and regarding the latter, the author affirms it to be worked

under limestones and red sandstones, and that extensive beds of red

sandstone overlie this coal formation, and stretch from thence to the
Solway Firth, while the coal strata are cut off on the north against the
transition rocks. Mr. Wood entertains little doubt that the coal series
of Dumfrics-shire is to be placed on the same parallel as that of Ber

wickshire.

   Specimens of rolled stones, and a fragment of quartz, were exhibited
and Mr. Witham stated them to have been found in the main coal seam
of Cockfield-fell colliery, in a portion of which they are of frequent oc
currence. This portion is comprised in about 3 acres on the north side
of the trap dyke, which does not seem to have influenced the position
of the stones, as these are found in many instances at a distance of 400
yards from and occasionally at greater distances. Similar specimens
have been also met with on the south of the dyke as far as the outcrop
of the coal. In the coal which altered by the dyke for about 25 yards
on each side, only one solitary specimen has been found, though they
are abundant in the solid coal adjacent. A specimen has been also
found at St. Helen's Colliery, two miles to the north-east.

above. The memoir includes also a description of the Pottery coal
field, which fills a long trough from Biddulph to Lane End, on a syn
clinal axis from north to south.
   After a minute  examination of many cases
the author states                                     of disturbed stratification,
                   that, upon the most general
                                                      view of the position of the
carboniferous system, in this district, it is perceived to be one great
arched elevation on an axis from north to south, having also a gradual
slope to the south. This great elevation is made up of many minor
undulation;, the higher parts of the middle of the arch being stripped
off, and the inferior beds exposed to view. On every side, as soon as
the beds descend to a sufficiently low level, they are masked from fur
ther observation by beds of the new red sandstone.

   Mr. Jukes describes minutely the proofs of the gradual attenuation
of the magnesian limestone in its course to the South near Nottingham,
till it dwindles to one yard in thickness, and is lost under the westward
range of red and white sandstone which borders the Nottinghamshire

and Derbyshire coal-field on its south side.
   Connected with this superposition of the red sandstones on eoal,

(themselves covered by the red and white clays which constitute the
upper part -of the red formation) is a point of great practical import
ance, viz. the extent to which coal may be reasonably looked for be
neath these red rocks.

   Among other evidence bearing on this question Mr. Jukes describes
the narrow extensions and peculiar aspect of the red sandstone in the vi
cinity of Ashbourne ; notices the physical configuration of the country
along the junction line of the red formation and the coal strata, which
in places indicates a great depression of the latter, and the production
of valleys in it anterior to the deposition of new red sandstone. He
states, finally, that it is probable that a large part of South Derbyshire
and the adjacent district is composed of the rocks belonging to the
lower part of the carboniferous system, covered by the new red sand
stone ; that the north point of the Leicestershire coal-field must be
looked upon as the connecting link between the coal-fields of Derby
shire on the one hand, and of the north of Staffordshire on the other;

that the present break between them was caused in part by denuding

forces acting before the new red sandstone period ; and, consequently,
that any mining operations in the south of Derbyshire in search of coal
are unlikely to be attended with success.

                                                      F.G.S.

Mr. Griffith exhibited his new Geological Map of Ireland, which had
been constructed at the Ordnance Survey Office, Dublin, by Lieute
nant Larcom, under the direction of Colonel Colby, of the lloyal

Engineers.
   Having briefly alluded to the geology of Ireland generally, and the
principle which had been adopted in colouring the map, Mr. Griffith
proceeded to illustrate the geological structure of the southern counties
by the description of the sections, one of which commenced in the
granite district of Mount Leinster in the county of Carlow, and ex
tended in a line nearly parallel to the south-east coast through the
counties of Kilkenny, Waterford, and Cork, crossing the valley of the
river Suir, at Carrick-on-Suir, passing over the summit of the Mona-
vullagh mountains in the county of Waterford, crossing the valleys of
the river Blackwater at Lismore, the Bride at Tallow, and the Lee at
Cork Harbour, and terminated at Cork Head on the south coast of
the county of Cork.
   The second section extended from Brandon Head in the county of
Kerry in a south-eastern direction, crossing the summits of Cahirconree
and Carrawntoohil mountains, the valleys of Keninare and Bantry, and
terminated at Gaily Head, also on the south coast of the county of

Cork.
According to Mr. Griffith's views, the structure of the south-east of
Ireland, commencing at Mount Leinster in the county of Carlow, and
following the order of superposition, consists of a base of granite, on
which rest strata of a rock intermediate between mica slate and clay
slate. To the south and west of Killeen Hill, clay slate extends to the
base of the conglomerate ridge of the county of Kilkenny, where at
Coolnahay Hill, in the line of section, beds of coarse-grained red con
glomerate, composed of rounded fragments of quartz, cemented by a
brown or reddish brown arenaceous paste' are observed to rest uncon
formable on the clay slate, which dips to the south at an angle of about
60° from the horizon, while the conglomerate beds dip nearly to the
same point at an angle of about 20° from the horizon. These conglo
merate beds are identical in position and composition with those which
underlie the carboniferous limestone to the north of Hook Head, and
in other parts of the county of Wexford, which are universally admitted
to belong to the old red sandstone series, and, like those of Coolnahay
Hill, rest unconformably on old clay slate.

   The thickness of the conglomerate at Coolnahay may be about 300
feet. It is succeeded by beds of coarse-grained quartzose slate, and
occasionally of red quartz rock.

    The same succession may be tracec as far as the river Suir, where
the red beds are succeeded in a coniormable position by strata of yel
lowish white arenaceous quartz rock, and these again by beds of greenish
gray imperfect clay slate, which latter rock alternates witli the lower
beds of the carboniferous limestone of the valley of the river Suir.
VOL. vn. 1838.
                     C
82 EIGHTH REPORT 1838.

   In this valley the strata of the carboniferous limestone form a syn
clinal depression, the beds to the north of the river dipping south, and
those lying south of it dipping to the north.

   On the south side of the Suir, the strata which have already been
described are observed resting in the same order of succession on the
extensive clay-slate district of the county of Waterford, in which are
situated the important slate quarries of Glenpatrick and other localities.

   Proceeding to the southward from the clay-slate district of Water-
ford, the line of section crosses the summit of the Monavullagh moun
tains, which consist of a vast accumulation of conglomerate similar to

that already described, and forming an escarpment nearly perpen
dicular for an elevation of about 500 feet ; the strata dip to the south
at an angle of 10° from the horizon. As in the cases mentioned lie-

fore, this conglomerate is succeeded by coarse red slate and quartz
rock, but in descending towards the river Blackwater, near to Lismore,
we find beds of roofing slate interstratified with the quartz rock, and it
is to be observed generally, that the roofing slate occurs only in the
upper portion of the red slate series.
    Approaching the Blackwater, the clay slate is succeeded in a con
formable position by yellowish white sandstone and sandstone slate,
which in many localities is found to contain casts of Calatnites, and
apparently of some varieties of Stigmaria, and these again, as in the
valley of the river Suir, by the greenish gray imperfect clay slate,
which alternates with the limestone of the valley of the river Black-
water. This valley, like that of the Suir, is connected with the ad
mitted carboniferous limestone district of the counties of Cork, Tippe-

rary, &c.
The whole of the limestone beds of the river Blackwater at Lismore,

dip to the south, but not at equal angles from the horizon ; on the
north side of the valley the angle of inclination does not exceed 20°,
while in the middle and southern side it amounts to 80° or 85°, but
still the inclination is to the south.

Proceeding to the southward beyond the limestone boundary, we
find greenish gray clay slate and yellowish sandstone similar to those
already described on the north side, inclining to the south at an angle
of about 85° from the horizon. Judging frorn the position of the strata
alone, these schistose and arenaceous beds might be supposed to be
superior, instead of inferior to the limestone. But arguing from the
analogy afforded by other localities in the south of Ireland, there can

be no hesitation in admitting that the strata are here contorted.
    Contortions are frequently observable on the sea coast and in many
precipices and quarries in the interior of the country, and although,

when seen at the surface, the strata everywhere dip towards the south,
still these strata present a series of convolutions, frequently on a small
scale, both sides of which incline to the southward, though usually at
different angles. This peculiarity is general throughout the southern
counties, and is  alike observable in the transition
series and the                                           slate, the   limestone
                  culmiferous strata, -- a circumstance     which    shows the
necessity of extreme caution in making calculations as to the probable
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  83

thickness of any formation, founded solely on the persistence of the
dip of the strata towards any particular point.

    To the south of Lismore a low ridge intervenes between the valleys
of the river Blackwater and the river Bride at Tallow. This ridge is
composed of coarse red slate, and occasionally rather fine-grained
greenish gray clay slate. The strata for the most part dip to the
south, but in the centre of the ridge they form an anticlinal axis.
Approaching the valley of the Bride at Tallow, we again meet with
yellowish white sandstone beds containing Catamites similar to those of
the valley of the Blackwater, and also greenish gray imperfect slate,
which, as before, is succeeded by the limestone ; here the calcareous
strata form a regular trough, those on the north side dipping to the
south, and on the south side to the north, beyond which we have the
usual succession of strata which are interposed between the red schistose

beds and the limestone.

   Proceeding to the southward, the section crosses the barony of
Barrymore in the county of Cork, which forms the base of the lime
stone trough of the valley of Middleton and Youghal, and thence con
tinues to its southern termination at Cork Head. Within this space
a succession of strata similar to that already described, is repeated
three times ; first we have the red quartzose slate ridge of the barony
of Barrymore, succeeded by the limestone trough of the valley of Mid
dleton and Youghal ; next the low red quartzose ridge of Great Island
in the harbour of Cork, succeeded by the limestone of that harbour,
Carrigaline, &c. ; and lastly, the red quartzose ridge of Hoddersfield,
which is succeeded on the south side by the blackish gray carboni
ferous slate which forms so characteristic a feature along the south
coast of the county of Cork. This blackish gray slate appears to be
similar to the greenish gray slate of the valleys of the Suir, the Black-
water, and the Bride ; it underlies the limestone of the valleys of Mid
dleton and of Cork Harbour, where it contains small Orthocerata in great
abundance, and in some localities it contains Catamites. Approaching
the limestone of Cork Harbour at Rosslillan, Renniskeddy, &c. the
slate assumes a gray colour, is interstratified with limestone, and con
tains numerous fossils belonging to the carboniferous series, identical
with those which occur in a similar position at Killinamack, in the
county of Waterford, close to Knocklofty Bridge, over the river Suir.
On the evidence of the sections thus briefly described, Mr. Griffith
grounds his conclusion, that the limestones of the valley of the Bride,
Cork Harbour, &c. belong to the same geological series as those of the
Blackwater and the Suir, which are connected with the great car
boniferous limestone field of Ireland, and this inference from the ob
served position of the rocks is stated to be confirmed by the evidence

at present collected from organic remains.
    In respect to the section of the strata near the western coast of the

counties of Kerry and Cork, already mentioned, which was also exhi
bited by Mr. Griffith, similar proofs respecting the order of super
position of the strata were brought forward to show that the limestone
of Killarney, Kenmare, and Bantgry2 belongs to the carboniferous, and
84 EIGHTH REPORT -- 1838.

not to the transition series ; and also that the red conglomerate beds
of Cahirconree, and Carrantoohill mountains, together with the coarse
red slate of which Tornies and Glena mountains at Killarney are com
posed, belong to the old red sandstone series.

   It is to be observed, that the schistose strata belonging to the se
condary formations of the south of Ireland are much more compact than
those of the northern districts, and hence we find the quartzy slates
and sandstones of the old red sandstone series have assumed the form
of coarse clay slates and quartzy rocks ; and also the dark gray car
boniferous slates of the south of the county of Cork, which contain
 Ortltocerata, Calamites, &c, have assumed the character and fissile struc
ture of ordinary roofing clay slate ; and several extensive slate quarries
have been opened in different parts of the district, but these slates are

not found to be of a durable nature.

On  a  small  Tract  of  Silurian Rocks in  the County  of  Tyrone.  By

                         Captain Portlock,  F.G.S.

   Captain Portlock remarked that he first recorded the existence in
the County of Tyrone of rocks of the Silurian system, in the 1st volume
of the Ordnance Survey Memoir of the County of Derry, and that he
considers this to be the first authenticated case of their occurrence in

Ireland, though there is little doubt that they also exist in Kerry and
other counties. The tract in question is small, extending only over a
few miles of surface in the eastern portion of Tyrone ; it rests upon
granitic and other primary crystalline rocks, and is succeeded by rocks
partly belonging to the old red sandstone, and partly to the carbonife
rous system, by which it is completely detached from other rocks of a
similar epoch. Apparently it has been raised up from its original level
by the intrusion or eruption of the granitic mass, a movement which
must have occurred prior to the deposition of the more recent rocks, as
they exhibit no appearance of disturbance. The portion of the Silu
rian system, here exhibited, appears capable of sub-division. The lower
or gritty slate is manifestly a fragmentary rock, and remarkable for
containing great numbers of a brachiopodous bivalve, which is either
identical with, or very similar to, Orthis grandis of Murchison. Above
this is a black, smooth schist, occasionally slightly calcareous, and some
times thinly laminated by calcareous spar. This is the depository of the
Graptolites (Lomatoceras, Bronn), which are abundant.

    The upper part of the Silurian district is a more decided slate, and
abounds in Trilobites of the genera, Calymene, Asaphus, Cryptolithus,
(Green,) Trinucleus, (Llwyd and Murchison). IlUenus? perovalis,

Memoir, and these and other fossils, such as Orthocerata, Bellerophon,

Lingula, etc. figured.

communicated by tlte Natural History  Society          of Liverpool,       through
Dr. Buckland.

These footsteps were first noticed, in June last, by Mr. Cunningham
and Mr. Tomkinson, who have taken means to preserve specimens in
the Museum of the Natural History Society of Liverpool. Dr. Buck-
land having visited the quarries last week, confirmed the accuracy of
the statements contained in the present communication. He found
nearly all the circumstances identical with those attending the footsteps
of similar animals discovered at Hildberghausen in Saxony, three years
ago, in a bed of white stone belonging to the new red sandstone forma
tion. The most remarkable of these footsteps are those of the hind- feet
of the Cheirotherium, which nearly resemble the form of a large man's
hand ; the fore-feet of this animal have made much smaller impres
sions : other footsteps of four or five smaller animals are found on the
same slabs with those of the Cheirotherium ; they are apparently the
tracks of small aquatic and land tortoises. (A further account has
--been communicated to the Geological Society since the meeting at
Newcastle   See Geological Proceedings, vol. iii. No. 59.)

   Dr. Buckland exhibited and explained enlarged sections copied from
Cotta's recently published sections, showing granite and syenite over
lying strata of the chalk formation at Hohnstein, Oberau, and Wein-
bohla in Saxony ; and laid on the table Mr. Cotta's Memoir in which

they are described.

   Dr. Buckland stated the object of this plan to be the rendering these
substances available for economical purposes, by moulding them into
the form of bricks ; and stated the results of trials made by Mr. Oram,
at Woolwich, to test the efficiency of this substance, when it appeared
that in working a 10-horse pumping engine, 750lbs. of this prepared
fuel were equivalent to 11281bs. of Wylam Main coal.

                                  10461bs. of large Welsh coal.

Description of a Cave at Cheddar, Somersetshire,       in which Human      as

                                                        By Mr. Long.

   After noticing the circumstances which led to the discovery of the
bones, the author describes the cave.
86 EIGHTH REPORT -- 1838.

The cave is situated on the summit of the range of the Mendip, in
limestone rock, and the entrance to it is from the flat surface, not from
any broken chasm in the declivity of the rocks. This is generally the
case with the other bone caves hitherto discovered in these hills, all of
which are in the like strata of rock. The fissure of rock by which the
cave was entered is about thirty feet in depth, a perpendicular descent

thence bearing to the west, is the opening which leads into the cave
from general appearances, and from what was afterwards discovered
this does not appear to have been the original entrance to the cave,
and most likely was made for the purpose of admitting light and air.
On entering the cave from this opening, the visitor finds himself in a
lofty but not very large chamber, about sixty or seventy feet in height
from this cave there is an arched way into another smaller chamber,
and from thence an ascending path leads towards the plain surface of

the rock ; this passage was undoubtedly the original entrance.
The bones were found in a detritus of soft mud or diluvium, as is the
case in all the other ossiferous caves of this district, and so circum
stanced as to be defended from the pressure of soil above, and excluded

from the air. The human bones were found beneath the animal bones,
so far as the cave has hitherto been searched ; a few remains of foxes
and sheep were found at the head of the cave, but the bones to which

attention was particularly drawn, were found in a mass, in quite a sepa
"Irate position, and easily distinguished from those of a more recent date.
"In searching in the cave," says Mr. Long,    found some bones im

bedded in stalactite,     as also one almost  forming part (as it might be
termed) of a rocky                            the work of many hours to

together, with a large quantity of human bones, and with them were
the bones of bear, deer, ox, and horse. By comparison with the bones
in Mr. Beard's extraordinary collection at Banwell, they are exactly
similar and apparently of the same era. Some of the bones and sculls
fell to pieces and crumbled to dust on being exposed to the air."

   Mr. Trimmer's attention being drawn to the investigation of diluvial
phenomena in North Wales by the discovery of marine shells of exist
ing species near the summit of Mael Tryfan in Caernarvonshire, which
is 1392 feet above the sea, he has become impressed with a growing
conviction that the detrital deposits of North Wales were suddenly
spread over pre-existing land, and not gradually accumulated beneath
the sea. The evidence on this subject he has presented to the Geolo
gical Society, Dublin. In the present communication he describes the
                 TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                       87

occurrence of marine remains covering the bones of land animals in
Cefn Cave, in Denbighshire, on which he has also presented a memoir

to the same society.

    The principal deposit of bones lies beloto the level of the entrance,
and beneath one if not more than one crust of stalagmite. The bones
in this lower deposit are accompanied by rounded pebbles of grauwacke,
slate, and limestone. The surface of the upper mass of marl, with an
gular pieces of limestone and bones, is covered by a deposit of sand,
divided by a few inches of finely laminated marl, and in this sand, the
total thickness of which, including the marl, does not exceed 18 inches,
are fragments of marine shells. These fragments are small and not
very numerous, but they are not smaller than a considerable portion of
the fragments dispersed through the northern drift which covers the
surface of the neighbouring country. At the extremity of the exca
vations in the cave, this sand is covered by a thin film of stalagmite.
No marine remains were found in any other part of the cave, nor were
any perforations of lithodomous shells seen on the sides.

On  the  Shells  of the  Newer Pleiocene Deposits.  By James Smith,

                          F.G.S., of Jordan Hill.

   The author communicated the result of a comparison made by him
between the marine shells found in elevated stratified deposits belong
ing to the newer pleiocene tertiary formation of the British Islands,
with those now existing in the adjoining seas. Out of 176 species, 92
per cent, were recent, and 8 per cent, extinct or unknown.

On  Vertical   Lines of Flint,  BtyravCe. rLsiyngellH, oFri.zRo.nSt.a,l  Strata  of  Chalk,
              near Norwich.                                              G.S.

   It has long been known that near Norwich the horizontal beds of

flint nodules in the white chalk are crossed by perpendicular rows
of much larger flints, often several yards in height. These larger and
vertical flints are provincially called potstones, and are the same as
those which occur in the chalk of Ireland, and are described by Dr.

Buckland under the name ofparamoudra. At a place called the Grove's
End House, near Horsted, about six miles from Norwich, an excava

tion has been made, from 15 to 20 yards wide, and nearly half a mile
in length, through 26 feet of white chalk, covered by strata of sand,
loam, and shelly gravel, about 20 feet thick. In the chalk thus in
tersected, the rows of potstones are remarkable for their number and
continuity ; it is affirmed by those who for more than twenty years
have superintended the cutting of the canal, that every row of upright
flints has been found to extend from the top to the bottom of the
chalk, so far as the excavation has been carried downwards. The
rows occur at irregular distances from each other, usually from 20 to
88 EIGHTH REPORT -- 1838.

30 feet apart, and they are not portions of continuous siliceous beds
in a vertical position, but piles of single flints running through the
chalk, like so many wooden stakes driven into mud. Few of the sepa
                                           are pear-shaped. They are very
rate flints are symmetrical, but some      to three feet in their longest dia
unequal in size -- usually from a foot
meter. At the point of intersection between a row of potstones and
one of the horizontal beds of flints, there is no mutual interruption
or shifting, but they are united as if both were formed at one time.
Each potstone is not siliceous throughout, like the nodules of flint in
the horizontal beds, but contains invariably within it a cylindrical
nucleus of chalk, which, when deprived of its siliceous envelope, has
the form and smooth surface of a tree when stripped of its bark. This
internal mass of chalk is much harder than the ordinary chalk sur
rounding the flints, and does not fall to pieces when exposed to frost:
                                                           of each
it  penetrates the flinty covering at the  top and bottom  in one   potstone.
     ventriculite was observed in the      chalky nucleus           instance.
A

The author concluded by inviting those geologists who resided near

Norwich to examine these phenomena more minutely ; and adverting
to the late discoveries of Ehrenberg, declared his expectation that the
origin both of the vertical and horizontal masses of flint would be

found to be intimately connected with the fossil remains of Infusoria,
sponges, and other organic beings.

          On t/ie Stratification of Rocks. By John Leithaht.

   The strata in Alston Moor, to which Mr. Leithart's personal obser
vations have been chiefly confined, consist of numerous alternations of
limestone, argillaceous shale or 'plate,' and sandstone. The definite
order in which these rocks succeed one another, the variety of inclina
tions which they present, the phenomena of faults which interrupt the
continuity of the strata, and other facts, appeared to the author inex
plicable as the result of deposition from water, followed by elevatory
action or the influence of heat.

   Being engaged in the study of galvanism, he remarked that many
other substances besides metals would, when piled in alternate layers,
develop electrical action, and became impressed w ith the opinion that
the stratified rocks might be likened to a galvanic battery, and that the
peculiar appearances above noticed might receive an explanation upon
this supposition, provided there was a communication across the enor
mous 'pile' of rock : such a communication is made, the author thinks,
by mineral veins.

    Upon this hypothesis he proceeds to show the probability that mixed
sediments would be re-arranged by the electrical action into alternating
distinct zones or strata, and confirms his reasoning by the result of
direct experiments. In the first of these, a battery of 28 cylindrical
plates of copper and zinc was used, but the author finds 18 or 20 pairs
answer better. The copper plates had about 9 and the zinc plates
about 6 square inches of surface. They were placed in jars, containing
              TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                89

a mixture of 59 parts water and 1 part muriatic acid. The substances
submitted to experiment were limestone and sandstone, mixed and re
duced to fine powder and made into a paste with water. This mixture
was put in a glass tube half an inch in diameter; the ends of the tubes
were closed by metallic discs united to the connecting wires of the
battery ; and thus the mixed sediment was interposed in the line of
the electrical currents. The result was a decided appearance of stra
tification, and a strong cementation of the mass.

   In all the subsequent experiments the author endeavoured to imitate
nature by a more slow electrical action, and employed only spring water
as an exciting fluid.

   In a mixture of limestone and shale the former was invariably re
arranged on the zinc or negative end of the battery, and the shale on
the other. In a mixture of limestone, sandstone, and shale, the same

result occurred, the sandstone grains remaining in the middle, and
being of the three the most consolidated. By adding to the small battery
by whicli limestone and shale had been stratified the influence of
another of equal force, the stratification became waved; by adding a
greater electrical force, the materials collected at the upper end were
seen to be displaced and carried irregularly through the other parts of
the mass in thin veniform portions. The author considers these ex
periments strongly confirmatory of his hypothesis.

    Several tubes filled with the substances named, and answering in the
arrangement of them to the description given by Mr. Leithart, were
exhibited to the geological section, and the author was prepared to re
peat his experiments for the satisfaction of the members. He remarks
that discs of tin and silver answer best for closing the glass tubes.

On Faults, and Anticlinal and Synclinal Axes. By Johs Leithart.

It is the opinion of the author, that these remarkable interruptions
to the symmetrical arrangement of the earth's strata are not to be ex
plained as the consequence of real changes in level of the surface of
the earth, but as the result of electro-dynamic agency in the interior,
operating through the mass of the rocks. The truth of this opinion
he attempts to demonstrate by comparing the real phenomena of faults
and axes of displacement   of the strata, with the effects     of electrical
action predicted upon the  following suppositions : --

1   --  That  electrical currents circulate in the earth;  by  which  the  elec
        That  faults, veins, &c. are the chief channels
2.
        trical equilibrium between the surface and interior of the earth

         is maintained ;
3.-- That the stratification of the rocks forming the earth's crust is

        the result of the electro-polar action of these currents ;
4.--That each stratum possesses its own peculiar electric condition

        and currents.

On  the  Production of a   AHgoernizcoyn. taBl yVeRinoboefrtCaWrbeonraeteFoox.f  Zinc  by
         means of Voltaic

    In this experiment a quantity of finely pulverised slate was mixed up
in an earthenware vessel with a strong solution of common salt, and
allowed to subside and form a bed, resting on a plate of zinc, which
had been previously placed at the bottom of the vessel. A plate of
copper, connected by a wire of the same metal with the zinc, was then
placed horizontally on the bed, which was about l£ inch in thickness ;
the whole being covered by salt water. On taking out the contents of
the vessel, several months afterwards, a well-defined vein of carbonate
of zinc, about ^jth of an inch thick, was found in the bed, in nearly a

Ithorizontal position. This vein occurred rather nearer to the copper

than the zinc plate, and extended over several inches of surface.
was sufficiently hard to admit of its being taken out of the bed in
plates, and many parts of it would scratch glass, in consequence of mi
nute portions of quartz having been inclosed therein. The carbonic
acid was doubtless derived from the atmosphere, and the flat or hori
zontal position of the vein may be ascribed to the perpendicular direc
tion of the voltaic action ; because, in other experiments, in which si
milarly moistened clay was placed between vertical plates of copper and
zinc, similar veins were formed in & perpendicular direction. The veins
were of different kinds when different metallic solutions were employed,
and the effect was generally most satisfactory when a constant battery
of several pairs was used.

   In many instances, when copper was present in the solution, the car
bonates of zinc and copper were found in the mass of clay, occurring
together in the same vein, not mixed, but in parallel plates, side by side,
the copper being on the side of the vein nearest tlie zinc plate, and the
zinc on the side nearest Hie copper plate. This definite arrangement is
too constant to be referred to any other cause than voltaic agency, and
its resemblance to some of the phenomena of mineral veins is very
striking. The most marked of these results have been obtained by
T. Jordan, of Falmouth, by the long-continued action of a constant
battery of several pairs of cylinders on clay moistened by a solution of
sulphate of copper.

    The fossil teeth to which this notice refers were found imbedded in
coal from Inverkeithing, in the county of Fife. They were deeply
fluted at the base, but had no hollow cone within, like those figured by
Dr. Buckland, in his Bridgewater Treatise, and discovered by Dr.
Ilibbert in the limestone of Burdie-house.

   In all the teeth which Sir D. Brewster has examined, the interior was
filled up with a yellowish brown mineralized substance, having in the
centre of the section or the axis of the tooth a white substance of the
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                             91

same character. The surface of fracture was partially covered with a
number of small and exceedingly thin scales, almost perfectly transpa
rent. They adhered to the brown matter with such tenacity that it was
difficult to detach them for the purpose of examination by the micro
scope. Within the fluted base of one of the teeth, the white and brown
substances are united together very irregularly, and in some places are
combined with a third substance of a coaly nature, which burns without
flame or smell, upon a heated iron. The enamel is in many places
finely preserved. It has a yellowish transparency, and exhibits a sort

of ramified structure both by reflected and transmitted light, the re
flected tints having in some places a sort of nacreous lustre.
    During the examination of the brown substance by which the cavity

of the tooth is filled, the author noticed something like a veined struc
ture ; and upon a narrower inspection succeeded in tracing a regular
structure in every part of  exactly similar to that of nodule of
aagate. The brown substance, which consists of bituminous and calca
reous matter, seems to have been deposited and indurated in successive
                                        of it,layers concentric with one mould of enamel, by which they were in

idea of this structure, which Sir D. Brewster found more or less di
stinctly developed in every tooth. Upon subsequently examining the
fossil teeth of Burdie-house, deposited by Dr. Hibbert in the Museum
of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the author perceived distinct traces
of the same structure in one or two which presented fractures capable
of displaying it.

    Both these groups lie at a distance one from the other of about 3
miles, in a valley running nearly N. and S., which occurs exactly at the
part at which Professor Rogers, of Virginia, has placed the anticlinal
axis of this part of the Alleghany chain. The same series of rocks is
in fact repeated immediately to the east and west of the Springs, and
assumes a nearly vertical position in both cases.

   2nd. In the state of New York, at Lebanon, west of Albany, is a
thermal spring, possessing the temperature of 73°, and emitting bub
bles of gas which consisted of nitrogen 89"4, oxygen 10"6, without a
trace of carbonic acid. It occurs near the junction of talcose slate
with highly inclined beds of limestone, belonging to the Transition or
Silurian system, and there are traces of a fault near it.

    The carbonated springs of Ballston and Saratoga are not in general
regarded as thermal, but the temperature of one of those of Ballston
was found to be 50"5, of the other 49\5 ; whilst at Saratoga, the New
Congress Spring and Hamilton Spring both had a temperature of 49£,
and Congress Spring one of 51°. Now the mean temperature of Sche
nectady, the nearest point to these springs at which a meteorological
register has been kept, is stated to be only 46"20. The gas given out
by both these groups of springs was of the same quality, consisting
chiefly of carbonic acid, but containing also a small residuary portion
of air, in which nitrogen existed in larger quantity than in the atmo

sphere.

    3rd. In the state of Arkansas, near the river Wachita, between the
34th and 35th parallels of latitude, and 16 degrees of longitude west of
Washington, occurs a group of thermal springs, varying in temperature
from 148° to 118° of Fahr., and emitting bubbles of gas which were
found to consist of carbonic acid 4, nitrogen 92'4, oxygen 7'6. They
gush out from the junction of clay slate with quartz rock, both belong
ing to the primary chain of the Ozark mountains.

    The professor concluded by pointing out the correspondence between
the phenomena of these springs, both as regards the composition of the
gases emitted, and their position amongst rocks that had been sub.
jected to violent action in their immediate neighbourhood, with those
which he had deduced in his report on mineral waters, published in the
Transactions of the British Association for 1836, from a survey of the
mineral waters existing in various parts of Europe.

                                      Austen, F.G.S.

The object of this communication was to examine the soundness and
applicability of certain geological inferences, regarding the ancient
land and sea, which have been freely adopted, sometimes in a general
sense, upon local                    loimf ietxeidstidnagtan, aitnusruef.ficiTehntelysucbojmecptasreddisc(utshseedauwtheroer

                               areas over which particular mineral characters extend,
and the degree in which the conformity of such characters is to be
esteemed evidence of contemporaneous deposition; the succession of
organic life in the ancient land and sea, and the contemporaneity of
identical species in unconnected deposits and distant quarters of the
globe ; and ancient climate.                The investigation does                        o: f--con

          viz. that contemporaneous deposits, in situations removed from

          wall have been deposited at high angles.

                 On Lunar Volcanos. By T. W. Webb.

   The author, after showing the inadequacy of some of the grounds
upon which the activity of lunar volcanos is often maintained, states
the result of particular observations which appear to him to support

the"  conclusion.              he    observes,  "that  either the formation of new craters,

      It is obvious,"

or the enlargement of those previously existing, would afford convincing
proof of the continuance of explosive or eruptive action : and having

                 of the
one and the other of these changes have taken place since the observa
tions of Schroter at the close of the last century."
The general result                   is,  that craters apparently of recent origin, and

not to be found in Schroter's plates, are now equally conspicuous with
   94 EIGHTH REPORT 1838.

   those which he has delineated, and in situations where it is hardly con
   ceivable that he could have overlooked them ; and that in other places
   those which he has represented now exhibit a difference in magnitude
   which cannot well be explained by any supposition of accidental haste
   or inaccuracy. The charts of Lohrmann unfortunately do not contain
   those portions of the lunar surface in which Mr. Webb conceives these
   alterations to have taken place; but he had the pleasure of finding
   several of his observations confirmed by the beautiful Mappa Seleno-
   graphica of Messrs. Beer and Madler ; and he expresses a hope that a
   more extended and accurate investigation may, in the course of a few
   years, not only bring to light the progress of many interesting changes,
   but may even enable us to form some inferences as to the nature and
   mode of action of that power which has produced such extensive and
   multiplied revolutions upon the lunar surface.

   On the  Construction  of  Geological Models.  By Thomas Sopwith,

                                    F.G.S.

   Next to the actual inspection of any object, a model is the most per
   fect means of conveying a clear idea of the general appearance and
   construction of the object which it represents ; and in some cases a

   model exhibits and explains details which either cannot be grasped at
   once by the eye in the real object, or which are hidden from actual in
   spection, as in the case of the geological structure of the earth, or the
   interior of mines.
   Some difficulty, however, has been found in conveying to ordinary
   workmen such a knowledge of geological or mining details, as shall
   enable them to execute a work of so much intricacy as these subjects
   usually present. The following method was pursued in the construc
   tion of a model of Dean Forest, and it is equally applicable to any geo
   logical model of a district.
   Being in possession of an accurate plan and sections of the district,
   derived from surveys which he had made for the Commissioners of
   Woods and Forests in 1834*, Mr. Sopwitli divided the tract of country,
   comprehending about thirty-six square miles, by two series of parallel
   lines intersecting each other at the distance of a mile from each other.

   A vertical section was then prepared, corresponding with each of these
   lines. These several sections were drawn upon thin pieces of wood,
   which were united together    by being what workmen term
   forming a skeleton model of  vertical sections. After having  half  lapped,
                                                                       united,
                                                                 been

   the sections were taken separately, and cut into portions corresponding
   with the contour of the several layers of strata to be represented, the
   corresponding points of intersection having been previously marked
   with figures. These respective portions are again united, to form the
   exterior boundary or vertical edge of a square mile of rocks. The in
   terior of each of these squares is filled with wood, and carved so as to

*
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  95

coincide with its boundary edges. Any intermediate portion of the
square may be ascertained by inserting a slip of wood cut to any known
section ; and in this manner the dislocations of strata, or any other phe
nomena, may be at once delineated, so as to enable the workmen to
execute it in the model. By this means a connexion is at once esta
blished between the scientific drawings of the geologist and the opera
tions of a common workman.

    The contour of the surface is obtained partly by the upper edge of
the section or slips of wood already described, and partly by the use of
a gauge or graduated pencil sliding in a frame, and acting in the same
manner as the gauge used by sculptors in transferring dimensions from
a cast to a block of marble.

    This method of constructing geological models was illustrated by

several examples.

On the Antiquity of Organic Remains. By the Rev. G. Young, D.D.
   In this communication Mr. Young opposed the inferences generally

admitted among geologists, as to the high antiquity of the stratified
rocks, and the successive eras of existence of the organic remains of
plants and animals imbedded in them. He endeavoured to show that
the production of the phenomena observed was possible in less time,
and with fewer changes in the condition of the globe, than modern
writers commonly admit.

                  On Peat Bogs. By G. H. Adams, M.D.

   From a microscopic observation of the substance of fresh and old
peat, the author described the gradual growth of the vegetable mass,
and its conversion into condensed peat. To render peat bogs fit for
agricultural purposes, the author proposes to take oft' the upper part,
and to burn it in large smouldering heaps, using the ashes as manure
for the subjacent peat surface. He also notices the practice of sprin
kling diluted sulphuric acid over and through heaps of the surface-cut
peat, thus ' souring ' the peat and rendering it of considerable value as

manure.

Esq. President of the Royal Geographical Society of London.

   It may be remembered that M. Baer has on a former occasion de
scribed a well, nearly 400 feet deep, at Yakutsk in Siberia, in which
the temperature of the soil at the bottom was found to be about the
freezing point ;-- and the object of the present communication is to ex
plain the measures taken by the Imperial Academy of Sciences at St.
Petersburgh fully to investigate this point, to ascertain precisely, uot
only the law which regulates the temperature of the ground to the
depth which is affected by the periodical change of summer and winter,
but also the influence of the external air in penetrating into the sides
of the well or shaft at Yakutsk ; and, finally, to ascertain the depth
which the summer heats generally reach.
    The experiments recommended for this purpose are, to introduce

pairs of self-registering thermometers into the side of the well at the
several depths of 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 150, &c. to 350 feet; the
thermometers to remain a whole year, and to be examined daily. M.
Baer also points out the importance for physical geography, to ascer
tain the. thickness of perpetually frozen ground in countries whose mean
temperature is considerably below the freezing point ; for                           ;
                                                                                             as at
Yakutsk, the ground never thaws at depth of from 300 to 400 feet,                       if,

all the small streams where superficial waters only are kept in a fluidis
state in the summer, must be in the winter entirely waterless and vice
versd, we may conclude, that all rivers which do not come from the

south, and whose course entirely within those countries which pre
serve perpetual ground-ice, and yet do not cease to flow in the winter,a
must receive their waters from greater depths than those which remainis
in frozen state. This circumstance                     not devoid of interest in the

tensive possessions in North America afford so ample                                 field for

Sketch  of   the recent Russian Expeditions to Novaia Zemlia. -- By
                                 Professor Baer.

    The object of this sketch was briefly to enumerate the different ex
peditions sent out by the Russian government, in order to illustrate
map of Novaia Zemlia, in which the outline of the islands marked as
represented in our most modern maps, and its actual outline as
now known to exist whence appears that more than half the eastern
portion of the land must be obliterated from our maps.

    Many curious details also were given with respect to the vegetation
and climate of these regions, whose mean temperature appears to be
that of the freezing point.

    Gambia, in Western Africa.

   Although the special object of our inquiries, as geographers, is the
surface of the earth we inhabit, yet, observes the author of this notice,
it may be permitted to pause for a moment in our more ordinary re
searches for the purpose of contemplating a native of one of the little-
known regions of western Africa, and to mark the vicissitudes in the
life of a Mandingo, who in his native village had been in company
with Mungo Park, one of the first and best of our African travellers,
and successively to notice him as a slave, a soldier in the British army,
a freeman, and, finally as about to return to the house of his fathers,
and to impart to his countrymen some few of the blessings of civiliza
tion which he may have acquired during an absence of more than a
quarter of a century from the land of his birth.

   It were needless here to enter into any detail of the life of Mo-
hamed-u SiseT ; suffice it to observe, that the chief points of geographi
cal interest are, that we have been enabled to obtain from him some
itineraries in the country of Senegambia, noting places not to be
found in our maps, but more especially a vocabulary of more than

2000 words and phrases in the Mandingo tongue ; and when we con
sider how extensively diffused is this language, perhaps the most so
of any of the thirty-six families of language into which authors have
classified the 115 languages (not dialects) of Africa, and that hitherto
a vocabulary of about 100 words is all that we possessed of

perhaps be admitted that this native of the Gambia has not offered anit
unprofitable subject of geographical inquiry.

ing those spots which theory pointed out as the positions where, with
any degree of probability, the southern magnetic poles will be found.
The paper also mentioned the expedition to the South Seas, which has
just left this country, fitted out by several merchants, but chiefly under
the direction of that spirited individual, Mr. Endcrby, whose orders
were to proceed in search of southern land, and to endeavour to attain as
high a south latitude as practicable ; and concluded with an earnest
appeal to the British Association, that the glorious work of discovery
begun by our distinguished countryman, Cook, might not be left in
complete. Europe, the author observed, looks to this country to solve

--the problem of Terrestrial Magnetism in the southern hemisphere,

and unanimously points to that individual who has already planted the
"red cross of England" on one of the northern magnetic poles, as
the officer best fitted to be the leader of an expedition sent out for
such a service.

   The author of this paper first gave a rapid but comprehensive sketch
of the physical geography of India, noting its coast line, its elevated
table lands, and the mountainous region of the Himalaya; he then
drew attention to the origin, in 1759, and to the progress, of the mea
surement of the great meridional arc of 1320 geographical miles in
length, extending from Cape Comorin on the south, to the foot of the
Himulaya, and effected by Colonels Lnmbtoii and Everest ; and con
cluded by an appeal to the British Association, that through their
recommendation the future progress of that survey should be conducted
in accordance with the present state of science, in this country, and in
a manner worthy of the munificent liberality of the East India Com
pany, by whose orders this great national work has been undertaken
and carried into execution.

      In this paper, the author gave a summary of the reasons, derived
   from Arabic as well as modern authorities, and from his own personal
   experience on the river Quorra, as to the possibility if not probability
   of the course of the river Tchadda having been mistaken ; and that in
   stead of flowing from west to east, as represented by Denham, that it
   flows from east to west and joins the rivers Shary and Quorra, thereby
   affording water communication to the interior of central Africa.

   west longitude, differing full 45 miles from its position in our present

      This letter, dated Hit, June 1, 1838, described the facility with
   which the steamer had ascended the river from Basrah to that place.
   Between Hillah and Hit, it speaks of a broad, deep, and beautiful
   stream, in some of the bends nearly a mile wide ; the country extremely
   fertile ; the crops of corn abundant, and just reaped ; the population of
   Arabs along the banks extensive, and apparently happy, welcoming
   the approach of the steamer with shouting and dancing, and supplying
   their want of fuel with great readiness and cordiality. The produc
   tions of the country, as wool, naphtha, bitumen, glii (or butter), tallow,
   corn in abundance, and horses of the finest breed, are mentioned as

   easy to be obtained, and in large quantities ; and the letter concludes
   with an expression of the writer's conviction that a profitable trade
   might easily be established ; and, after the experience he has had of the
   river, that there are no physical obstacles to its free navigation with
   properly constructed vessels.

      An explanation was then given of maps which were exhibited, and
   particularly of that showing the line of levels carried between the
   Mediterranean at Iskenderfin, and the river Euphrates at Birehjik,
   whence it appears that the city of Antioch is situated 300 feet above the
   sea; the town of Birehjik, 628 feet ; and the highest point between the

   sea and the river rises 1720 feet above the Mediterranean.

On the Wild Cattle of Chillingliam Park. By J. Hindmarsh, of

                                          Alnwick.

The author stated that he had been obligingly assisted in his present
attempt to give an account of the wild cattle of Chillingham, by the
following communication from their noble proprietor :

I" Sir, -- Some time since          " Grobvenor Square, 8M June, 1838.
                            promised to put down upon paper what
ever I knew as to the origin, or thought most deserving of notice, in
Irespect to the habits and peculiarities of the wild cattle at Chillingham.
   now  proceed to    redeem my promise, begging pardon       for the   delay.
        first place,                                          to their  origin
In the                I must premise that our information as

is very scanty; all that we know and believe in respect to it rests in
great measure on conjecture, supported, however, by certain facts and
reasonings, which lead us to believe in their ancient origin, not so much
Ifrom any direct evidence, as from the improbability of any hypothesis
ascribing to them a more recent date.  remember an old gardener of
the name of Moscrop, who died about thirty years ago, at the age of
perhaps eighty, who used to tell of what his father had told him as hap
pening to him, when a boy, relative to these wild cattle, which were
then spoken of as wild cattle, and with the same sort of curiosity as
exists with regard to them at the present day. In my father's and grand
father's time we know that the same obscurity as to their origin pre

vailed ; and if we suppose (as was no doubt the case) that there were
old persons in their time capable of carrying back their recollections
to the conversation still antecedent to them, this enables us at once to

look back to a very considerable period, during which no greater know

Iledge existed as to their origin than at the present time. It is fair,

however, to say, that know of no document in which they are men
tioned at any past period. Any reasoning, however, that might be
built on their not being so noticed, would equally apply to the want
of evidence   of that which would be more easily remembered or recol
lected --the  fact of their recent introduction. The probability is, that

they were the ancient breed of the island, inclosed long since within
the boundary of the park. Sir Walter Scott rather particularly sup
poses that they are the descendants of those which inhabited the Great
Caledonian Forest, extending from the Tweed to Glasgow, at the two
extremities of which, namely, Chillingham and Hamilton, they are

Ifou"nd.must observe, however, that those of Hamilton, if ever they were

of the same breed, have much degenerated.
   "The park of Chillingham is a very ancient one. By a copy of the

endowment of the vicarage, extracted from the records of Durham,
and referring to a period certainly as early as the reign of King John,
about which time, viz. 1220, the church of Chillingham was built, the

vicar of Chillingham was, by an agreement with Robert de Muschamp,
to be allowed as much timber as he wanted for repairs, of the best oak
out of the Great Wood of Chillingham, the remains of which were ex
tant in the time of my grandfather. The more ancient part of the
                                to have been built in the next reign,    that of
cIIaIs.t,lesinaclseo  appears   has been held, without interruption,     by the     Henry
                      which it                                                      family
of Grey. At what period, or by what process, the park became in
closed, it is impossible to say; but it was closely bounded by the do
mains of the Percies on the one side, and by the Hibburnes on the
other, the latter of whom had been seated there since the time of King
John ; and as the chief branch of the Greys always made Chillingham
their principal residence, until it passed into the hands of Lord Ossul-
ston, by his marriage with the daughter and heiress of Ford Lord Grey,
it is reasonable              to suppose that, in order to secure their cattle, wild and
tame, they had                recourse to an inclosure probably at an early period.         '
                             are some other places in which a similar breed is found :
It is said there
Lyme Park, in Cheshire ; Hamilton, as I before mentioned ; and Chart-

                             different colour,                    every   respect.   Those

at Hamilton, or rather Chatclherault, have seen, and they in no de
gree resemble those at Chillingham. They have no beauty, no marks
of high breeding,              no wild habits,  being kept, when I saw them, in a
sort of paddock;
                             and I could hear   no history or tradition about them,

which entitled them to be called wild cattle. Those at Chartley Park,

on the contrary, closely resemble ours in every particular ; in their

learn more from Cole, who has now been park-keeper at Chillingham
for many years, than from any information can give. can mention,
however, some particulars. They have, in the first place, pre-emi
nently, all the characteristics of wild animals, with some peculiarities
that are sometimes very curious and amusing. They hide their young,
feed in the night, basking or sleeping during the day; they arc fierce

when pressed, but, generally speaking, very timorous, moving off on
the appearance of any one, even at great distance. Yet this varies
                                                     a

very much in different seasons of the year, according to the manner
in which they are approached. In summer,                          have been for several

weeks at time without getting a sight of them, they, on the slightest

sanctuary. On the other hand, in winter, when coming down for food
into the inner park, and being in contact with the people, they will let

you almost come among them, particularly on horseback. But thenif
they have also thousand peculiarities. They will be feeding some

times quietly, when,            any one appear suddenly near them, particu

larly coming down the wind, they will be struck with a sudden panic,
and gallop off, running one after another, and never stopping till they
get into their sanctuary. It is observable of them as of red deer, that
they have a peculiar faculty of taking advantage of the irregularities
of the ground,                    disturbed, they may traverse the whole
park, and yet   so that on being
                you hardly get    a sight of them. Their usual mode of
retreat is to get up slowly, set off in a walk, then a trot, and seldom

Ibegin to gallop till they have put the ground between you and them

in the manner that have described. In form, they are beautifully
shaped, short legs, straight back, horns of very fine texture, thin skin,
so that some of the bulls appear of a cream colour ; and they have a
peculiar cry, more like that of a wild beast than that of ordinary cattle.
With all the marks of high breeding, they have also some of its defects.

They are bad breeders, and are much subject to the rush, a complaint
common to animals bred in and in, which is unquestionably the case

with these as long as we have any account of them. When they come
down into the lower part of the park, which they do at stated hours,
they move like a regiment of cavalry in single files, the bulls leading
the van, as in retreat it is the bulls that bring up the rear. Lord Os-

sulston was witness to a curious way in which they took possession, as

it were, of some new pasture recently laid open to them. It was in
the evening about sunset. They began by lining the front of a small
wood, which seemed quite alive with them, when all of a sudden they
made a dash forward altogether in a line, and charging close by him

across the plain, they then spread out, and after a little time began

feeding. Of their tenacity of life the following is an instance. An old
bull being to be killed, one of the keepers had proceeded to separate
him from the rest of the herd, which were feeding in the outer park.
This the bull resenting, and having been frustrated in several attempts
to join them by the keeper's interposing, (the latter doing it incautious
ly,) the bull made a rush at him and got him down ; he then tossed
him three several times, and afterwards knelt down upon him, and
broke several of his ribs. There being no other person present but a
boy, the only assistance that could be given him was, by letting loose
a deer-hound belonging to Lord Ossulston, which immediately attacked
the bull, and by biting his heels drew him off the man and eventually
saved his life. The bull, however, never left the keeper, but kept con

tinually watching and returning to him, giving him a toss from time to
time. In this state of things, and while the dog with singular sagacity
and courage was holding the bull at bay, a messenger came up to the
castle, when all the gentlemen came out with their rifles, and com

menced a fire upon the bull, principally by a steady good marksman
from behind a fence at the distance of twenty-five yards ; but it was
not till six or seven balls had actually entered the head of the animal,
(one of them passing in at the eye,) that he at last fell. During the
whole time he never flinched nor changed his ground, merely shaking
his head as he received the several shots. Many more stories might
be told of hair-breadth escapes, accidents of sundry kinds, and an end
less variety of peculiar habits observable in these animals, as more or

In addition to this letter, Mr. Hindmarsh communicated some inaa
formation collected from Mr. Cole, the keeper, and from his own ob
servation. There are about eighty in the herd, comprising twenty-fiveaa
bulls, forty cows, and fifteen steers, of various ages. The eyes, eye
lashes, and tips of the horns alone are black, the muzzle                    brown,
the inside of the cars red or brown, and all the rest of the animal

white. Even the bulls have no manes, but little coarse hair on their
neck. They fight for supremacy, until few of the most powerful
subdue the others, and the mastery no longer disputed. When two
bulls are separated by accident, they fight when they meet, althoughis
friendly before, and do so till they become friends again. The cows

they conceal their calves for a week or ten days after they are born,
suckling them two or three times day. The late Mr. Bailey, of Chil-
                                        a

lingham, found calf, two or three days old, very poor and weak. On
                 retired few paces, and then bolted at him with all its

force he stepped out of its way, and fell down, when the whole flock
                                                    it

came to its rescue, and forced him to retreat. They do not often die

and became as tame as the domestic ox, and thrived as well as any
short-horned steer could do, and, in its prime, was computed to weigh
65 stone. They are shy in summer, but tame in winter, and will eat
hay from a fold, although they will not taste turnips. When one of
the herd becomes weak or feeble, the rest set upon and gore to

Constable, Yorkshire, and at Dunnlary, in Dumfries-shire, but these
are now extinct.
The author quoted passage from Boetius, which, allowing for
little colouring, described these animals very well, except in the non
existence of mane. The cattle at Dunnlary had black ears, but in
all other points resembled those of Chillingham and this may be ac
counted for by statement of Bewick, that about forty years ago some;
of the animals had black ears at Chillingham, and were shot           ;      by

On  a  rare  Animal from  South America.  By Lieut.- Colonel Sykes,

                                 F.R.S.

The animal in question was described by Azara as Cam's jubalus ;
but the description given by Azara himself led the author to suppose

it ought not to be placed in that genus. It differed from the dog tribe
in its nocturnal and solitary habits : it had a long mane, its tail was
Ifthicker and more bushy, the head flatter, the eyes smaller, the nose
sharper, and the whole animal more bulky than the dog tribe.            it

differed from the dog, it differed more from the fox and wolf; and he pro
posed to refer it to the genus hyaena, or, if this could not be admitted, he
would make it a distinct genus, which would then be the representative
of the hyaena tribe in America, which we must suppose possessed some
analogue of that tribe in the old world. Colonel Sykes also exhibited
the skin of a European Felis, which Temminck names Felis pardina,
and states is known as the lynx of Portugal : it is not, however, known
by this name amongst London furriers.

    On certain Species of Sorex. By Rev. L. Jenyns, F.L.S.

The Hev.L. Jenyns exhibited a series of specimens of the square-tailed
shrew (Sorex tctragomirus, Herm.) and pointed out the distinguishing
characters between it and the common shrew (S. rus/icus, Jen.). He
also exhibited a specimen of the chestnut shrew (S. casianeus, Jen.)
which he had formerly considered as a mere variety of the S. tetrago-
7iurus, but of which he had now seen three individuals, and which he
was satisfied deserved to rank as a distinct species. It is principally
characterized by the bright chestnut colour of the upper parts, though
there are other differences in the tail and in the form of the cranium.
It was observed generally that the characters of the cranium were
found    of great assistance in determining the several species  of this ge
         Mr. Jenyns also exhibited two undescribed species of     the genus

Cimex as restricted by entomologists of the present day. One of these,
which has been alluded to by Latreille, though never characterized,
was found inhabiting in great numbers the nests of the common house

martin. The other was taken from a Pipistrelle I3at. It was proposed
to call these two species C. hirundinis and C.pipistrelli. At the same
time the peculiar characters were pointed out, by which each was di
stinguished from the other, as well as from the C. lecttdarius of authors,
or common Bed-bug.

            On Marsupiala. By Professor Owen, F.R.S., fyc.

   Mr. Owen briefly stated the results he had come to in the course of
his investigation of these animals, under the three following heads:
first, the zoology of Marsupiata ; secondly, their relation to other
Mammalia; and, thirdly, the peculiarities of their reproductive econo
my. 1. With regard to their zoological characters, they present as
many forms, and as varied habits, as all the Carnivora put together.
In their kind of food they are very various. Some are entirely car
nivorous, as those of New Holland. Some are insectivorous, like the
Orycteropus and Myrniecophaga, among the other Mammalia. A spe
cies of these is described by Captain King, as having a divided hoof like
the Huminantia. Some of them are arboreous, as the Didelphes and
Perameles. Many of the Marsupiata are strictly herbivorous, as the
kangaroo-rat, &c. Mr. Owen thought, however, with all the varieties
of character and habit presented by these animals that they had been
too largely subdivided by zoologists. 2. In regard to their relation to
other animals, he was of opinion, that they ought to be considered
as one group; for although they differed greatly in some respects,
still they agreed in so many remarkable points, that they could not be
consistently separated. Of these points the most remarkable were the
development of the hind legs ; the existence of the marsupial bag ; the
circulatory apparatus being less perfect than in the rest of Mammalia,
the blood being returned to the heart by two veins, as in the hearts of
reptiles and birds ; and in the hemispheres of the brain, which are not
united by a corpus callosum. In this last respect, they are like the
oviparous division of vertebrate animals, a fact first pointed out by
Mr.Owen ; having the same relation to Mammalia, that the Batrachians
have to the Ophidian, Saurian, and Chelonian divisions of reptiles. 3.
The reproductive economy of these animals was slightly touched upon.

It had been supposed, that the young were produced by budding from

the marsupial pouch ; but this was now proved to be erroneous, and the
first stages of their uterine growth were known to be like that of other
Mammalia.

    Mr.Owen then entered into some geological account of these animals.
 Dr. Buckland had found the jaw of an animal in the Stonesfield strata,
 which, from a peculiar mark only seen in the jaw of Marsupiata, could
 be well identified, and proved to be analogous to the present genus
 Opossum, or Didelphis. Major Mitchell has in his collection a large
 number of bones belonging to extinct genera of Marsupiata. From the
jaw of one of these animals, there is reason to conclude, that its pos
 sessor must have been double the size of any species of kangaroo ex
 isting at the present time.

Remarks on the Greenland and Iceland Falcons. By John Hancock.

On the question of the specific identity or difference of these birds,
Mr. Hancock, in opposition to some English writers, has arrived at the
conclusion that they are truly distinct. This opinion he has formed
from an examination of many individuals of the Iceland and Greenland
birds, his attention having been first awakened to the subject by a sight
of two individuals brought from Iceland in 1833 by Mr. G. C. Atkinson.
Besides various other specimens, minutely described by Mr. Hancock,
he was fortunate enough to be furnished, by the exertions of Mr. VV.
Procter, who visited Iceland last year, with an opportunity of inspecting
a ' brood ' of five Iceland falcons, viz. the parents and three young
ones, which Mr. Procter shot on the same crag.
On comparing the male, female, and young of these gray Iceland
birds with the corresponding white falcons of Greenland, the differences
became manifest, and Mr. Hancock endeavoured to show, by an investi
gation of other allied species, that the supposition of continual change
of plumage, after maturity, by which it has been attempted to account
for these differences, is not tenable. Mr. Hancock does not admit a

white variety of the Iceland falcon, and thinks it doubtful whether this
bird inhabits Greenland ; while the white bird of Greenland is rare in
Iceland, except during winter and on the northern parts of the island.
The author concluded his communication by a minute comparative

late years in more cases than one. The first instance was twelve or
thirteen years ago: a bird of this species was seen for some weeks about
Hornsea Moor in the East Riding of Yorkshire ; it was some time after
presented to the author, in whose collection it is at present, in perfect
preservation. Another, in full summer plumage, was killed by a la
bourer in the fields of James Hall, Esq., of Scorborough, near Beverley,
about three years ago, and is now ill the possession of that gentleman.
Another specimen of this bird is in the collection of Mr. Foljambe, of
Osberton, with a label on the case, stating it to have been killed near

that place. A careful examination of these specimens will, Mr. Strick

land has no doubt, prove that this bird is properly separated from the
large egret of North America, which has been frequently placed in our
collections for the British species.

On a species of Scyllium,  taken on the Yorkshire Coast.                    By Arthur

   The author's attention was directed to this subject by Dr. Riley, of
Bristol, who had stated at one of the meetings of the British Association,
that he had found the rudiments of a third toe in the ostrich. Neither
in the specimens which he has placed in the Museum at York, nor in
one that he obtained lately, for the express purpose of looking for this
rudimentary toe, has he been able to discover any thing like this third
member of the foot. He further stated, that Cuvier had given the
number of the phalanges of the toes wrong in the following birds. In
the cassowary, which has three toes, the real numbers of the phalanges
are three, four, and five. In the ostrich, four and five. The Capri-
inulgus has the outer and middle toe, having four phalanges each. The
swift has only three phalanges, except in the hallux. The humming
bird has the full number of phalanges in all its toes.

On Tetrao Rakelhahn. By Edward Charlton, M.D.

Dr. Charlton, in this communication, described the appearance of two
individuals of the species or variety of Tetrao above named, and assigned
the reasons which induce him to believe that it is a hybrid between the
Tetrao urogallus and Tetrao tetrix. In favour of this opinion he
quotes Bechstein and Nillson, though on the other side Temminck de
scribes the bird as a distinct species. Mr. Charlton stated that he found

Notice of the  Annual    Appearance on the Durham Coast                   of  some  oftAe
                Leslris
                         tribe. By Edward Backhouse.

   The author stated, from observations made during a series of years,
while occasionally residing in the neighbourhood of the Tees' mouth,
that the Lestris Richardsonii is the earliest of the genus in its appear
ance on these shores when on its southern migration.

   The young birds seem usually to arrive in the beginning of Septem
ber, and in the middle of the same month the adults, accompanied by
the young of the Lestris Pomarinus, make their appearance, generally-
continuing for about three weeks, when they are succeeded in the mid
dle of October by the mature Pomarine Skuas; these, as far as Mr.
Backhouse has been able to discover, continue for the like space of

three weeks and then disappear.

   He last year met with Lestris Pomarinus in its mature state in con
siderable abundance off Hartlepool and the Tees' mouth.

   Early in the autumn of 1836, while at the same place, he obtained
one of the Lestris tribe which materially differed from any he had be
fore met with.

    This specimen is in the immature plumage, very much resembling

in its markings the young of L. Pomarinus. In size and proportions
it nearly approaches L. parasiticus ; and having recently compared it
with a nearly mature specimen of L. parasiticus, also shot on the coast
of Durham, now in the collection of Mr. John Hancock of Newcastle,
he is induced to conclude it to be the young of that bird.

    Its admeasurements are as under, viz. :--

Length from bill to tail                                              17 inches.

Expanded wings                                                        32

He also stated that L. cataraclcs was met with, though rarely, on
this coast.

The paper was accompanied with drawings and stuffed specimens of
the various species.

   In the month of November, 183Y, Mr. Yarrell received from W.
Ewing, Esq., of St. Vincent Street, Glasgow, a specimen of a smelt,
which was at the first glance so obviously different from our well-known
and esteemed favourite, as at once to claim for it the title of a distinct

species ; and the specimen was the more interesting from the circum
stance that this fish is not only new to our own country, but is also
entirely new to ichthyology, no second species of the genus Osmeras
having hitherto been made known.

   The gentleman just named passed part of the summer of 1837 near

Rothsay in the isle of Bute, and the fish in question was brought to
him by a fisherman, who stated that he caught it on a hand-line in the
bay of Rothsay about 200 yards from the shore, in twelve-fathom wa
ter ; that it was, though well known, but rarely seen ; that specimens
varied from 6i to 8 inches in length ; that they were full of roe in
June, and when first caught the cucumber-like smell was very apparent.
   Mr. Yarrell thus              the characters of this       species of Osme-
riis, for comparison  describes  common smelt : -- In    new  new fish the jaws

teeth upon the tongue ; the eye very large ; the upper surface of the head
convex ; the form of the operculum circular ; the dorsal fin commencing
half-way between the point of the nose and the anterior edge of the adi
pose fin ; the anterior edge of the adipose fin is at the end of the second
third of the space between the dorsal fin and the end of the fleshy por
tion of the tail, while the ventral fins, which are in the middle of the
whole length of the head and body in both species, are, by the proxi
mity of the first dor.ial fin to the head in the new smelt, brought in a
vertical line underneath the posterior edge of the first dorsal fin ; the

The form of the body is elongated and slender ; the lateral line straight ;
above it the colour of the body is of a pale yellowish green ; below it
is a broad longitudinal stripe of bright silvery white, passing, by a shade
of yellowish olive, to an iridescent silvery white on the belly.

The author exhibited a large collection of British fishes, and read

notes upon their specific characters and synonymy, which he proposed
to embody in a work devoted to the Natural History of Fishes*. The
species most copiously illustrated by Dr. Parnell's observations, were
Motella cimbria of Linnaeus, Payelhis acarine, Raia chagrinea, hitherto
seen by very few naturalists, and Raia intermedia, which he thinks has
not been previously described.
Besides various other interesting fishes, Dr. Parnell exhibited to the

   After giving a sketch of the history of this family, and especially of
the genus Sternoptix, Dr. Handyside entered into a minute description
of a new species, which he proposed to call S. catlebes, distinguishing it
from S. Hertnani and S. Olfersii, to which it most nearly approached.
He considered these three fishes to form a distinct group or sub- fauiily

On a Fish with Four Eyes. By W. H. Clarke and John Mortimer.

In this communication the authors state, that at Fort Amsterdam
(Surinam) shoals of small fishes appear periodically, having four di
stinct organs of vision. They observed that the water of the river, or
rather estuary, on which the fort is built, was blackened for miles along its
margin by innumerable multitudes of these fishes, which were followed
by scarlet flamingos. The description given of these fishes agrees in
several points with the character of the Anableps*, the only fish known
to naturalists which, by the double pupils of its eyes, may deserve the
title of tessaropJuhalmoid, proposed by the authors for the little fishes
they observed. It

    On a new British Shell. By E. Gray, F.R.S., fyc.

to make of  new genus, which he would call Neara, and which

would be peculiar for the slender produced form of the under edge,
and the large size of the lateral teeth. He stated, that he knew

two species belonging to the same genus, one from China figured by

   The annular marks, and those in the direction of the growth of the
shell, and in the substance of the shell itself, are easily explained by
the increased or diminished degree of activity of the secreting surface
of the mantle. But the coloured angular lines are not so easily ex
plained. Mr. Gray supposed that the colouring of the shell was the
consequence of glandular secretion ; that, as the shell increased in size,
there was a tendency to divergence in the glands. He stated, that it
frequently happened in the progress of growth, that these glands were
obliterated, and the immediate consequence of this obliteration was the
production of a new gland : this gland was double, and, as it had a
tendency to diverge, it formed two angular lines which proceeded to a
certain distance, when it met with a gland formed in a similar way to
itself, and, on meeting, it became obliterated : after this obliteration, a
new double gland was formed, which proceeded in the same mode as
the first, and thus produced the angular coloured lines apparent on so

many shells.

        Notice of the Wombat. By J. E. Gray, F.R.S., §c.

   Mr. Gray stated, that in the Museum of the Natural History Society,
was the wombat which was sent by Bass to Bewick, and from which
he took his original description : from a misprint, this specimen was
said to have more teeth than it really has ; and, on this account, Illiger
having seen a specimen of the wombat, supposed this must be another
genus, and named this one in his work, Amblotis wombattus. The con
dition, too, of this specimen assisted in the mistake, for, having been
originally kept in spirit, it had lost its true colour.

      On the Boring of Pholades. By J. E. Gray, F.R.S., %c.

   A difference of opinion prevails as to whether the action of these

animals in excavating the rocks in which they are found is chemical
or mechanical. At one time Mr. Gray was inclined to think it M'as
the former ; however, he had lately an opportunity of remarking the
action of these animals in the chalk at Brighton, and he now believed
it to be mechanical. He then exhibited several specimens of chalk
which had been bored by the pholas, and pointed out some circular
grooves which were made in their interior by spines on the outside of
the shell, as well as a central impression produced by an elongation of
the shell to a point at its inferior surface. He slated that the animal
did not occupy the whole of the cavity it made, but the upper part
only. Why he had formerly supposed the action of these animals on
112 EIGHTH REPORT -- 1838.

the rocks to be chemical was, that the patella was known to bore ; and
this would be impossible by the action of its flat shell. There was a
little annelide, called Diplotis, which made elongated cavities in rocks.
Now this animal had no shell, and its action must of course be
chemical.

                        By

   For the purpose of stimulating zoologists to the investigation of the
distribution of the terrestrial and fluviatile Mollusca in Great Britain,
and the collection of data for that object, Mr. Forbes presented a

terials are few for such an investigation, and most of the published ca
talogues are almost unavailable from the authors not having guarded
against certain sources of fallacy." These Mr. Forbes points out in
order that they may be avoided in future.
   Instead of the political and artificial divisions for which European

local catalogues are published, the author proposes to consider the dis
tribution of terrestrial Mollusca according to natural districts, and pre

sents the following classification as suited to Europe :
   1st district. The greater part of Scandinavia, Iceland, the north of
Russia, Scotland, probably Ireland, and the greater part of England.

   2nd district. Germany (except Austria), the south of Sweden and
Denmark, the south of England, northern and central France, the chief
part of Switzerland.
   3rd district. The peninsula of Spain and Portugal, the south of
France, the west of Italy, the western Mediterranean Isles, Africa, Bar-

bary States, the Canaries.
4'th district. Dalmatia, Wallachia, Turkey, Greece, the eastern Me
diterranean Isles, Asia Minor, Syria.
5th district. Southern and eastern Russia, as far as Caucasus, ex

tending into Asia in Georgia.

peculiar conchologieal products, to be in this point of view a separate

own ; in some certain genera prevail, in others certain species ; these
divisions may be regarded as climates, and the Flora of each will be

found to correspond in its distribution with the Fauna."
   The author pointed out certain defects in the ordinary form of local

catalogues, and suggested the introduction of notices of the soil, rock,
frequency of occurrence, influences on distribution, variations of form,
&c, and proposed a series of queries relating to Mollusca in furtherance
of his general object.

   Mr. Hope described the Aphides as unusually destructive to various
species of plants. An insect named Tipula Tritici has appeared in
great abundance in some parts of the counties of Hereford, Worcester,
Gloucester, and Salop. From an examination of various samples of
wheat submitted to Mr. Hope, it appears that the damage clone by the
Tipula is less than in previous years.

The author stated, that as great differences of opinion existed amongst
zoologists as to the nature of the gemmiform bodies and vermiform
appendages of Actiniae, he had undertaken their investigation. Some
general remarks on the structure of Actinia; were premised, the author
pointing out, by means of a large diagram, the various directions of tiie
muscular septa, some lining the cavity and supporting the stomach of

the animal, whilst others more delicate terminated in a mesentery, sup
porting the gemmiferous bodies, or what has been erroneously called
the ovary. The division of the stomach into two lateral parts, giving
to the whole animal a bilateral symmetry, was pointed out.
   The Gemmiferous bodies are    about 200    in number, and    appear as
elongated masses attached along   the inner  border of most of   the leaf
lets. Each is composed of several horizontal folds or plaits, which,
when carefully unfolded, may, by the assistance of a lens, be seen to
consist of two delicate layers of membrane, enveloping one closely
compacted layer of gemmules. After enveloping the gemmules, the
membranous layers become placed in opposition, and form the mesen
tery, by which the gemmiferous body is attached to the leaflet. The
gemmules are round, except in an advanced stage of development,
when their outline becomes interrupted by the pressure of neighbour

ing gemmules. A well-marked central depression may also be seen
indicating the situation of the oral aperture, but without tentacula ;
when of large size, they form considerable depressions in the gem-

miform bodies, protruding before them their delicate investing mem

brane. In this state, they are readily detached by the point of a
needle. Their size is nearly uniform, except a few small ones, scat

tered very generally amongst the whole. There is no gradation in size

amongst them, as if they successively arrived at maturity, as imagined
by Dr. Spix. Some of the gemmules are, however, less developed than
others ; and at the same season of the year, it is not uncommon to find
individuals with the gemmules in very different stages of development,

miferous body; they are formed of numerous convolutions extending
from the superior to the inferior part of the gemmiferous body. They
are of a milk-white colour, about as thick as a horse-hair, extremely
soft, yielding readily to pressure with a needle. Superiorly, the fila
ments are very minute, so that their origin cannot be detected. In-
feriorly, they are of larger size and less convoluted, passing in a simple
wavy line to the stomach, where they terminate. During life, these
filaments exhibit a distinct vermicular motion, even after removal from

the animal. Ob removing some from the animal, and placing them in

sea-water, they exhibited considerable locomotive power, which lasted
for some time, when their outline became obscured, and in twenty-four
hours nothing remained but a whitish flocculent substance. This struc
ture is best seen in its living state. In fresh water it decomposes in
half an hour, but in proof spirit less rapidly. The author has succeeded
in preserving it best by spreading the filament and its mesentery
upon glass, upon which they may be dried. The function of these
filaments is involved in obscurity. By many, they have been regarded
as oviducts, but this the author thinks is very improbable, both from
the minuteness of their terminations, the size of the gemmules, and the
fact of ova never having been detected in them. In fact, the repro
duction of Actiniae must be looked upon as a strictly internal genimi-

parous process, in which the gemmules, when sufficiently matured, burst
their envelope, and become lodged in the interseptal spaces, where they
are exposed to the access and continued supplies of sea-water, the grand
stimulus to their future development. In the absence of any direct
evidence as to the nature of the vermiform filaments, the author sus
pects that they are elongated follicular glands, analogous to the sali
vary, pancreatic, and hepatic follicles of animals a little higher in the
scale of organization, supplying secretions subservient to the digestive

process.

of Ascaris, discovered by Dr. Bellingham, which he called A. aJata.

On certain           Monstrosities of the   Genus Encrinus.  By G. B.

                                            F.L.S.

Mr. Sowerby s immediate object was to point out certain monstrosi
ties to which the Encrinus
fect the anas. The plates   moniliformis    is subject, which  chiefly                               af
                            of the pelvis   (Miller) are also  affected                               in

number and somewhat in form.
   The radiaria are usually divided by five, i. e. the normal number of
plates of the pelvis is five ; though there are not wanting instances of
genera whose pelvis consists of only three plates : we shall, however,
find that even these return to the normal number (Pentatrematites), for
they have five scapulars, ten intercostals, &c. In Encrinus the normal
number of pelvic plates is five, the costals five, and the scapulars five ;
these are then usually divided, so that there are usually ten arms setting
off from the five scapulars. One of the monstrosities in question has
only nine arms, though it has five plates to the pelvis, five costals, and
five scapulars ; in this instance one of the scapulars only has produced
one arm, the other four having produced the usual number. Another
of the monstrosities has eleven arms, though this also has only the nor
mal number of pelvic plates, costals, and scapulars ; one of these last
sends off three arms. Another has eleven arms, arising from an in
creased number of pelvic, costal, and scapular plates, one of the scapu
lars sending off only one arm, the remaining five sending off two each.
Another specimen has twelve arms, arising from six pelvic plates, six
costals, and six scapulars ; in this instance, though each scapular sends

off two arms, one pair of pelvic plates, costals, and scapulars is uni
formly smaller than the other three pairs. Another individual, the last
instance mentioned of monstrosities in the number of arms, has thirteen,

which arise from six pelvic plates, six costals, and six scapulars, one of

these latter sending off three arms.

                   This cannot be taken as positive proof of their having been soft, but
                       may nevertheless be regarded as confirming Miller's opinion.

                    Notice of Microscopical Discoveries. By Professor Ehrexberg.

                         In this extemporaneous address the learned Professor stated, that lie

                     been able to effect of his great work on microscopic forms of life, a
                        work which, he observed, he should never complete, as the subject -was
                     inexhaustible, but that he should continue to extend it, as far as oppor
                     tunity would allow. After explaining many of the subjects represented
                     in the engravings, he submitted to the inspection of the members pre
                     sent a bottle of the material, collected in considerable quantity in the

                     the district give the name of Bergmehl, or mountain meal. This earth,
                     which resembles fine flour, has long been celebrated for its nutritious

                  qualities, and was found, on examination, to be entirely composed of

                     the. shells of microscopic animalcules. The Professor also explained

                      On the Production of Vanilla in Europe. By Professor Morren,

                                                                 of Liege.
                            The Professor commenced by stating, that some difficulty at present
                      existed in determining the species from which the vanilla of commerce
                      was produced, but the Vanilla planifolia would produce it. This plant
                        does not naturally produce odoriferous fruit ; but Mons. Morren had
                        succeeded in obtaining, for two years running, fruits as large and odo
                      riferous as those of commerce. The author remarked, that the culti
                      vation of this plant might be now attempted in our intertropical colo
                      nies, with the application of the principles of modern botanical science,

and that this substance might be obtained at a much lower price than
at present. The author thought the cultivation of the vanilla plant
could not take place in the British isles. In order to obtain good fruit,
the plant should be allowed to grow five or six years ; the fruit is not

in proportion to the flowers ; and the older, the larger, and the more

branches the plant possessed, the better is its fruit. Exposure to the
sun is not necessary for the maturation of the fruit ; shade, heat, and
humidity being the three conditions necessary for the flowers. The
stigma of the plant is supplied with a peculiar appendage, which covers
over the stigmatic surface in the form of a veil, and this requires to be
lifted up before the artificial impregnation of the plant can take place.
The author went into several particulars necessary to be attended to for
the successful cultivation of the plant.

   In this communication the author mentioned the discovery of the
following eight plants in these islands in addition to those noticed at

of Pinus and Abies had been lately introduced into this country. The
distribution of these throughout the world he divided into five groups :
-- 1. Those of Old America, which included the United States, the

Mississippi and Canada, with Labrador. 2. Those growing between
the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, in the district known by the name of

t"hDe oRuogclaksy  Mountains, and which might appropriately be  called the
                   Group." 3. The uplands of Mexico. 4. The     Himalaya
Mountains. 5. Europe. The first group contains about twenty spe
cies, none of which can be said to produce more than second-rate
timber. They are fine trees in their native forests, but degenerate in
Europe. 2. The "Douglas Group." Of these there are about fifteen
species, possessing all the qualifications for good timber, at the same
time that they are evergreens, and grow quickly; and from the pre
sent condition of the young plants in England, the most sanguine an
ticipations of their successful culture in this country may be enter
tained. At present, however, little positive information had been ob
tained with regard to this group. 3. The species from Mexico are at

   sessed   to warrant any             conjectures    as to their worth. 4.              Those

   Himalaya range are also few, and for the most part little known. Some
   of them may probably become naturalized in this country. The Abies
   Webbiana is a gigantic tree, but has not perfectly stood the last winter.
   Abies Morinda stood the winter very well. Both species are propagated
   by cuttings. .5. The European series is the most valuable. In this group
                                           as nearly as possible, in a direct ratio to
   the quality of the species              is,

   European series assigned to the Pinus cembra and P. uncinate, both
   of which grow in their respective Alpine and Pyrenean forests, above

   the P. sylvestris, or Scotch fir, and both excel in the quality of the
   timber. The Pinus sylvestris next, and its range from the Arctic
                                                is              it

   series may be considered P. Laricio, which grows in the mountains of
   Corsica, at rather higher elevation, and in lat. 43°, and does not de

   The species of Abies do not admit of the same extended observation,

 it at present ; as also Pimis taurica, which grows in the Crimea. The
cultivation of the hardier and more valuable species of these genera
was strongly recommended from the results of the experiments of the
Duke of Athol, who had found that timber of sufficiently good quality
for the ordinary consumption of the navy might be grown at 1-1 10th
the expense of oak, taking into consideration the rental of the land,
and the ground occupied, besides the vast value given to the land by the
fertilizing properties of the larch. The author estimated that 100,000
acres of waste, taken from the Grampian hills, for the growth of larch,
would, in two generations, not only supply all the ordinary wants of
the country, but enable us to export the timber. In the west and

south of England the Pinus Laricio and P. Hispanica would proba

bly succeed best ; the cedar of Lebanon might also be tried in these
districts. He also recommended the larch to be cultivated by the
proprietors of cold clay land in the nortli of England, as a means of
improving the land by the deposition of its spicules, the trees being
kept open for the admission of sheep for fifteen or twenty years, when
the trees being gradually thinned, open woodland would be formed,
the soil of which would be good. No other species of tree should be
mixed, as the larch is recommended merely as a fructifier or amelior
ator of the soil.

          On. Lycopodium Lepidophyllum. By G. B. Sowerby, F.L.S.

    Upon instituting a comparison between specimens in his posses
sion and the description and figures of Hooker, in his Icones Planta-
rum, t. 162, 163, Mr. Sowerby found them to agree so nearly that he
has no doubt these specimens belong to Lycopodium lepidophyllum : but
there are some points of difference.
    The first point of difference is in the disposition of the stalks, as
                                     oLfycthoep.stlaelkpidaos piht yallpupmea,rs"  in Mr. Sowerby 's

plant ;   for Hooker    says of his
caespitosis, stellatim dispositis ;" whereas in Mr. Sowerby 's plant the
stalk is spiral and very much branched.
    The next point of difference, and this must indeed be regarded as a
                                   form of the stipules, which                     Hooker

figure they appear to be more pointed than the leaves.                             of the fructifying

celebrity, from its remarkable hygrometric property, that specimens
form an article of commerce between Mexico and Peru. Like the
Anastatica Hierochuntica, or famous Rose of Jericho, in a dried state,

the stems and branches are incurved, so that the whole plant forms an

elastic ball ; on being moistened, the stems and branches spread out ho

rizontally, and this experiment may be repeatedly performed."

      One of Mr. Sowerby's specimens was presented to him by Mr.

    Cuming, who gave an equal weight in gold tor the specimen which he
    furnished to Sir VV. Jackson Hooker.

          On Vegetable Monstrosities. By tfie Rev. W. Hikcks.

    The author made some introductory remarks on the importance of
          sfitvuedyclaosfsems:o--nstr1o. sCitaiesse,s  and concluded by a distribution of them
    the                                                of coherence and adherence of parts not
    into
    usually united, or of separation of those which are ordinarily connected.
    2. Anomalies depending on the comparative development of parts of
    one circle. 3. Anomalous transformations of organs. 4. Monstrous
    exuberances of growth, by which the number of parts is altered, inde
    pendently of transformation, the number of circles of parts is increased,
    or the axis irregularly extended. 5. Anomalous abortions or suppres
    sions of parts usually present in the species. Among the monstrosities
    produced belonging to the first class, were a specimen of Convallaria
    multiflora, in which the two lowermost leaves cohered by their edges
    into a sort of bag, whicli considerably obstructed the growth of the
    stern ; a specimen of Tulipa Gesneriana, in which the leaf on the
    stem, folding round it, had cohered by its edges, so as completely to
    inclose the flower-bud, which, as it enlarged, carried up the upper part
    of the leaf, like the calyptra of a moss, or the calyx of Escholzia, and
    some adherent flowers, of which a specimen of Salpiglossis straminca
    was remarkable for the complete union of two flowers, so as to have
    but one calyx and corolla each, with a double number of parts. In
    the third class, a specimen was exhibited of Campanula rapunculus,
    with the bell-shaped corolla transformed into five additional stamens ;
    and one of Lilium longiflorum, with the stamens partially transformed
    into pistils, a stigma being produced at the extremity of each, whilst
    an imperfect anther was borne lower on the filament. Various other
    examples were produced in the several classes, which cannot be parti

    cularly noticed.

progress.
The following information was communicated to Dr. Bowring, by a
physician of long experience, in answer to a series of direct queries.

On the Origin and subsequent Development                                 the Human Teeth. By

                                 Mr. Goodsiii.

   The author has observed dentition commence by the formation of
what he denominates the primitive dental groove, on the floor of which
the rudiments of the pulps of the milk teeth appear as globular or co
nical papilla; septa afterwards pass from the outer to the inner side of
the groove, betweeu the papillae, and thus each of the latter becomes
situated in an open-mouthed follicle, which the primitive condition of
the future sac. After the formation of the milk follicles, the lips of the
groove still remain prominent and when in this condition Mr. Goodsir
is                                                                       is

denominates the secondary groove. The rudiments of the ten anterior
permanent teeth appear as little depressions in the secondary groove,
internal to the mouths of the milk follicles. The papillae of the milk
teeth now begin to be moulded into the form of pulps, change which

   synchronous with the closure of the mouths of the follicles by two or
more laminae, which agree in number, shape, and position with the cut
ting edges and tubercles of the future teeth. The lips and walls of the

secondary groove now adhere, except in the situations of the ten de
pressions for the permanent teeth, and for a small extent posteriorly on
each side, where a portion of the primitive dental groove remains in
its original condition. In this portion the papillae and follicle of the
first large molar tooth appear, and, after closes over, the lips of the
                                                                         it

in this situation a cavity which produces the sacs of the two posterior
permanent molars. The first large grinder may, therefore, be con
sidered in some measure milk tooth. The author observes, that den

tition begins, and always in advance, in the upper jaw, except in the
case of the incisive teeth, which, although they appear first, are later
in coming to perfection. This he explains by the tardy development
of the lateral elements of the intermaxillary system. The author di
vides dentition into three stages. The first one with which the au
thor states anatomists have hitherto been unacquainted, -- viz. the folliis
cular. The second and third they are familiar with -- the saccular and

the eruptive. From his researches, he concludes that the human teeth
122 EIGHTH REPORT 1838.

originate from mucous membrane, that the permanent teeth have no
connexion with the deciduous set, and that the sac and pulps must be
referred to the class of organs denominated bulbs.                          He      anticipates the
discovery of the follicular stage in the dentition of                       all

so, that it will explain the varying and complicated forms of the pulp

which takes place in the superior respiratory passages, and which has
been termed by M. Beau the "guttural" respiratory sound. In supa it
port of the first theory, was observed, that the best and almost the
only experiment was that of Magendie, in which air was blown into
the lungs by means of pair of bellows, and sounds, resembling
the respiratory murmur, were perceived from which M. Magendie
drew the conclusion, that because air passed to and from the lungs;

   From a great number of experiments upon the effects of division of

the nervus vagus, it was observed that no dyspnoea was induced, if a

sufficient quantity of air reached the lungs, and that the only constant
and invariable effect of division of both vagi nerves was a great dimi

nution in the frequency of the respiratory movements. Though the

believes that all the morbid changes observed in the lungs after death
are to be explained by the effects of the diminished frequency of re

spiration.

    Several experiments were related to prove that digestion not neces
sarily arrested after division of the vagi. These appeared satisfactory
to Drs. Alison, Knox, and others who witnessed them.

Experiments were related to prove that narcotic poisons produce
their deleterious effects as rapidly when injected into the stomach after
the division of the vagi as when these nerves are left entire.
Experiments were brought forward to show that division of the vagi
nerves previous to the introduction of poisonous dose of arsenic into

   The author maintains that in various diseases, and more especially in
severe neuralgic complaints, characterised by acute paroxysms of suf
fering of a periodic character, the efficacy of this method of employing
mercury is found strikingly beneficial.

   Two cases of this description of disease were adduced by the author
in proof of the correctness of his views.

On  the  Functions   of the  Rete Mucosvm    and Pigmentum Nigrum,  in  the
               Dark
                     Races   of Mankind.   By R. M. Glover.

   The paper of Sir Everard Home, published in the Philosophical
Transactions for 1821, is the first attempt to investigate the subject ex
perimentally. This author attributed the power of resisting the solar
heat, manifested by the dark races, to a property possessed by dark
surfaces of destroying the scorching and blistering effects of the solar
rays on the skin. Thus, according to him, were a black and a white
skin exposed to the same degree of solar heat, the former should rise

to the higher temperature, yet inflame the least.
   Mr. Glover endeavoured to prove, that the experiments of Sir Eve

rard Home are incorrect ; and that a black surface does not only rise to
a higher temperature than a white one under the sun's rays, but also
scorches and blisters the skin in a greater degree. He further attempts
to show experimentally that the scorching and blistering effects of white
and black surfaces are precisely in the ratio of their powers of absorb
ing heat, a conclusion which is entirely opposed to the opinion of Sir
Everard Home, who supposed that the rays of luminous caloric can
blister the skin in a degree greater than what is accounted for by the
quantity of heat contained in them.

    But although the skin of the black may absorb more heat than the
skin of the white man, and although we are unable to explain the su
perior tolerance of heat by the possessor of the former in the mode
adopted by Sir Everard Home, yet it is established that the organiza
tion of the inhabitant of the tropic, and especially of the negro, is pe
culiarly fitted to enable him to perspire freely on the application to him
of the stimulus of heat ; while in the adaptation of his system to respond
to this stimulus, and in the cooling effects of perspiration, which are

shown by many experiments, must be sought the mode in which he is
protected from the heat.

    The dark-coloured skin, the author is also of opinion, must radiate
at night very freely ; this agrees with the well-known fact that negroes
are exceedingly chilly in the nights of the tropics.

    The author related his experiments on four specimens of the fluid
procured from different individuals, all drawn off at 7^ months of utero-
gestation. The specific gravities varied from 1*0070 to 1*0086, the
proportion of solid contents being much the same in each specimen :
the solid ingredients varied, however, in relative proportion. Urea was
found in all the specimens, the other ingredients being albumen, fatty
matter, lactates, alkaline chloride, traces of sulphate, carbonate, and
phosphate of lime, with oxide of iron.

On Mr. Farr's Law of Recovery and Mortality in Cholera. By Robert
                                 D. Thomson, M.D.

    The principal facts elicited are the following :
    1. The probability of recovery can be determined at every stage of
disease by a simple tabular construction.
    2. The mean future duration can be determined at any given point.

   3. The rate of mortality, deduced day by day, shows that the fatality

increases up to a given point, then becomes stationary, and afterwards
decreases, according to a determined law. The rate of mortality attains
its maximum at different periods in different diseases : in cholera it is
at its maximum in twenty-two hours (eighteen to twenty-four hours) ;
in small-pox in ten to fifteen days; in phthisis pulmonalis in six to nine
months. When the disease has attained its acme and begins to decline,
the rate of mortality on any day being given, the rate of mortality on
any future day can be calculated, and vice versa. In cholera the rate
of mortality declines nearly 12 per cent, daily, from the 4-th to the 30th
day : in its course the diagram describes a regular curve, which will
represent in space what takes place in time. The rate of decrease va
ries in small-pox, but the variation is regulated by a certain law.

    4. The mortality no doubt increases according to a determined rate ;
but in cholera it attains its maximum so rapidly, that the law of in-
crease cannot yet be determined. The rate must be determined at four
or five equal periods in succession before the law of its changes can be
ascertained : this has not yet been done in any disease.

   5. The rate of recovery, like the rate of mortality, follows a pre
scribed rule : it increases according to a determined law, which has to
a certain extent been determined in cholera and small-pox.

   For the purpose of this investigation, the cases of each disease should
be recorded in the following form :

   Care should be taken to fix distinctly the time of invasion and the
time of recovery, whether it imply the time when the patient can first
digest food, or resume his ordinary occupation. The time of death is
easily determined. The cases of small-pox and cholera comprehend all
the diseases to which they give rise, or which follow in the same unin
terrupted series of morbid phenomena. The nature of the consecutive
diseases should be recorded. The author is anxious to impress strongly
upon every practitioner the utility of this simple registry of diseases, fol
lowing them from the beginning to the end of their course. The results
already obtained prove that the harvest will be rich : they show the ad
vantage too of extended observations, carried on by numerous obser
vers, on a uniform plan. No one person could have observed 900 cases
of cholera, and the law could not have been deduced from a small num
ber of observations.

    Several practical inferences are suggested by this investigation.

   1 . It demonstrates the important fact, that pathological phenomena

are as regular in their course as physical phenomena observed in inor
ganic matter; and that the instruments of physical investigation are
applicable to medicine : for, after due allowance has been made for
errors of observation and the limited number of cases, it will be found

that the facts can be as exactly expressed by formulae, as any facts in
the province of natural philosophy.

   2. A new field will be opened to the mathematician, and many inter

esting problems will arise for solution when accurate observations have

been collected. If the abstract sciences are every day descending to

practical applications, the empirical arts are also rapidly rising into the
region of knowledge.

On Sleep, and an ApparaJotuhsnfoDr aplrzomieolt,ingM.DA.rtificial Respiration. By

   In an essay on sleep drawn up in 1833, which constitutes the first
part of this communication, the author directed particular attention to
the dependence of this state on the feeling of fatigue in the muscles of
respiration. The effects which follow this feeling are, diminished ac
tion of the organs and function of respiration ; diminished action of the
organs and function of circulation ; diminished supply of arterial blood
in a given time to the brain ; and, finally, sleep as an immediate conse
quence of the latter condition. In the subsequent part of the paper,
128 EIGHTH REPORT -- 1838.

Dr. Dalziel describes an apparatus for ascertaining the practicability
of promoting artificial respiration, as a remedial means in certain states
of the system.

    Some time ago it occurred to the author, that certain diseases, accom
panied with depression, might be mitigated, and other depressed states
of the system effectually remedied, by immersing the limbs and trunk
of the body in air which should be alternately rarefied and recon-

densed, at the same time allowing the patient to inhale the air of the

external atmosphere ; the rarefaction and recondensation to correspond
with the motions of inspiration and expiration respectively. By this
means, it was expected the function of respiration might be directly sup
ported and the general system invigorated. Inspiration being assumed
to be the more laborious part of the process of respiration, and expira
tion to require little or no effort, it is the former part of the process that
in depressing affections requires assistance.

    The degree of assistance which might in these cases be afforded, could.
Dr. Dalziel supposed, be tested by experiments on persons in health,
with apparatus of very simple construction. That which he made use
of consisted of an air-tight box, large enough to contain the person to
be experimented on (the head and neck excepted,) in a sitting posture,
and a pair of circular bellows inside, which were used as a forcing air-
pump. The bellows were worked from without, by a piston rod, and
the air which at every stroke they discharged was prevented by a valve
from returning. In the side of the box were two small convex windows;
one for the admission of light, the other for allowing an attendant to
inspect the surface of the body during the experiment.

   When, by this apparatus, the pressure of the air was, to a certain extent,
removed from the parietes of the chest, the feelings of exertion and re
pose attending respectively on inspiration and expiration were completely
interchanged. The comparatively heavy air of the external atmosphere,,
which the person breathed, rushed along the air-passages and distended
the chest without effort. There was a prevailing disposition to inspire.
When the respiratory muscles were relaxed, the chest remained jienna-
nently distended, and a sensation of fulness of this cavity was distinctly
experienced. Expiration on the other hand became difficult and labo
rious. The feeling in the chest attendant on the effort was analogous
to that which is experienced in ordinary circumstances during inspira
tion, while supporting with the hands a heavy weight upon the breast,
and attempting to elevate it. The voice in the mean time became so
weak as to be almost inaudible.

   In order to produce the results above-stated, the air contained in the
box was rarefied by abstraction of about one-nineteenth of its volume.

   Dr. Dalziel suggested the application of this apparatus in all diseases
and affections of the system in which the functions of respiration and
circulation require to be roused or supported.

   A model of more refined apparatus to perform the same effects, and
several testimonials respecting the period of the invention, (1832,) were

presented to the Section.

                   injected into the Veins.   By J.

   Tha author described a number of experiments with various sub
stances, and their effect on the vascular system, as measured by an in
strument which he termed a Hoemadynameter, formed by a glass tube,
bent at an angle. One limb of this tube being attached to a scale,
allows of measuring the height to which a column of mercury is raised
by the action of the current of blood in the artery, into which the ex
tremity of the other branch is introduced. The substances introduced,
in solution, into the veins, were divided into three classes according to
their effects. In the first were those which produced death, by directly
acting on the contractility of the heart, amongst which were nitrate of
potassa, arseniate of potassa, sub-carbonate of soda, biniodide of arsenic,
oxalic acid, and solution of galls ; all these acted locally on the heart,
and agreed in effecting a change in the colour of the blood, turning it
black, probably by forming definite combinations with its constituents.
A remarkable difference was observable in the effects produced by the
same substances when absorbed from the stomach. In the second class

were those substances which acted directly on the nervous system ;
such were strychnia, hydrocyanic acid, and couia. And in the third
were those producing death by affecting the capillary circulation ; such
were tobacco, euphorbium, and digitalis. The last two classes of sub
stances did not produce any change on the composition of the blood.
Several other substances were experimented with, not falling under
the above classes, such as morphia and cantharides, the effects of
which were the same, and nitric acid : when the latter was injected
into the vein, the column of mercury in the instrument fell from seven
inches to one ; and after death, the right side of the heart was distended
with solid blood.

       Case of Anthracosis in a Lead Miner. By Dr. Crawford.

   The attention of the profession was first drawn to the subject of an
thracosis, or black infiltration of the lungs, in 1831, by the late Dr.
James C. Gregory, and subsequently other cases have been published
in the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal.

   Dr. William Thomson, of Edinburgh, has also published a paper, in
the London Medico-Chirurgical Transactions for 1836, on black ex
pectoration and black matter on the lungs.

   The subjects of all the cases made public have been either coal-
ininers or moulders in iron work, whose occupations have seemed to
give countenance to the opinion that the disease originated either from
the inhalation of coal-dust, gun-powder smoke, lamp smoke, choke
damp, or the impure air of mines, consisting of a mixture of carbonic
acid gas and the atmospheric air. In some of these cases there was,
during life, dark-coloured expectoration with evidence of serious orga
nic disease of the lungs, e.g. phthisis; in others, there was bronchites,
without expectoration of this dark matter; in a third class there were
bronchites and emphyseura of the lungs, likewise without the dark-
coloured matter ; and in the fourth and last class there was found, after
death, the black matter, no symptom nor sign of chest affection of any
kind having been present during life.

   The author presented a short report of a ease which disproved the
opinion that this deposit is found only in coal miners and moulders in
iron work. The individual was William Ritson, set. 77, many years
inmate of the Tynemouth Union Workhouse. He had been employed
from an early period of life as a lead miner, continuing at the employ
ment till within ten or twelve years of his death. During the middle
period of his life he had been at sea for five years.

On the Amount of Air required for Respiration. By Dr. D. B. Reid.

   From a very extensive series of experiments made upon the respira
tion of upwards of a hundred individuals, who placed themselves suc

cessively in an apparatus for this purpose; from trials made upon greater
numbers varying from 3 to 234, in apartments specially constructed
for the purpose ; and from observations made under his direction in the
House of Commons every day that Parliament had met during the
last two sessions ; Dr. Reid contended that the amount of air usually
allowed for respiration, in public buildings and private dwelling-houses,
was far below the standard required for sustaining either the bodily or
intellectual faculties in health and vigour. He remarked that great
errors in estimates        this point had          from a variety of causes ;
                     upon                  arisen
more especially --
1. From the extreme difficulty of calculating and regulating pre
cisely the supply of air in apartments constructed in the usual manner.
2. From the supply of air having been determined hitherto not by
precise experiments upon the person, but from calculations, which,
from the state of science, are at present necessarily imperfect.
3. From the amount of air required to sustain the functions of the
skin, and to facilitate by gaseous diffusion the removal of the matter of
insensible perspiration having been in a great measure overlooked.
   4. From neglecting the influence which even an excessively minute
quantity of some gaseous and volatile substances diffused through the

atmosphere may exert in gradually undermining the system.
   Dr. lleid's communication contained a variety of details in reference
to the constitutional peculiarities of different individuals in respect to
air, and he contended that they differed as much in this respect as in
reference to food and drink, exercise, temperature, clothing, &c.
   In adverting to the influence of heat, light, and electricity, he brought

forward a number of instances showing that the effect of light upon
the human constitution is as important in its action as in the power it

is known to possess upon the vegetable kingdom, and referred more
particularly to a case pointed out by Sir James Wylie, in one of the

largest barracks, where there were three cases of disease among the
soldiers whose apartments looked to a dark and dull court, for one

among those who were necessarily exposed to a bright light, the tem

perature, food, clothing, and discipline, being precisely the same.
   In concluding, Dr. Reid contended, 1. That the supply of air should

                                       k2
132 EIGHTH REPORT -- 1838.

amount at least to eight or ten cubic feet per minute in an atmosphere
at ordinary temperatures.

   2. That the amount of supply should increase greatly with the
temperature. In the House of Commons he had never given less than
thirty cubic feet for each individual when very crowded, and on one
occasion he had supplied sixty cubic feet for each member for three

weeks successively.

   3. That the same attention should be paid to the moisture in the air
as to the temperature, and that the hygrometer is as indispensable in
providing a proper atmosphere as the thermometer and anemometer :
5000 feet of moist surface were used at the House of Commons.

    4. That the air may be filtered from suspended impurities, and in
many local situations others may be separated with extreme facility.

   5. That from the pernicious effects of minute quantities of impuri
ties acting for a long period, it is desirable in providing artificial light
to exclude hermetically from every apartment all the products of com
bustion.

On  the  Modus Operandi     oBfyNitRraotbe eortf  Silver as a Caustic and  Thera
             peutic Agent.
                                                  D. Thomson, M.D.

   When a solution of animal matter, (for example, a solution of what is
usually termed albumen, obtained from the eggs of birds,) is added to
a solution of nitrate of silver, white coagula are immediately preci
pitated resembling chloride of silver, but differing on closer inspec
tion, as under the microscope, considerably from the latter salt. When
the precipitation is induced in considerable quantity, the upper portion
of the deposit soon begins to turn darker coloured, and gradually as
sumes a brownish appearance. The lower portion of the precipitate,
however, still retains its original aspect with the addition of bands of
dark matter, which traverse it in different directions. In addition to
this we observe, that it becomes matted together and has a stringy
consistence approaching to that observed in the incipient formation of
the mucous membrane. Having added an excess of animal matter to
the nitrate of silver solution, the author threw the precipitate on a filter
and washed it repeatedly with distilled water. On testing the liquid
with a solution of the animal matter no precipitation ensued, demon
strating that nitrate of silver in its original form no longer existed in
the solution, but had been entirely removed, or at least its properties
obscured, in consequence of the addition of the animal matter. To de
termine, however, whether any silver existed in the fluid, the latter was
evaporated on the sand bath. The solution gradually became dark-
coloured, and the evaporating basin in which the experiment was made
was coated at the upper surface of the fluid with a brown deposit. On
the total evaporation of the solution, a brown glazed-looking matter
covered the bottom of the vessel, which, on exposure in the cold, gra
dually absorbed moisture from the atmosphere, and was readily scraped
                 TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                     133

off from the vessel in the form of a moist powder. These experiments
                            compounds of albumen                              of   silver,

an acid and the other a basic compound. The author proceeded to
state the result of his endeavours to ascertain the operation of nitrate
of silver upon the animal economy. After numerous experiments
upon the secretions of the mucous membranes of the oesophagus,

by these              a circumstance which     admits
                                                        of ready explanation, if
we consider these fluids as merely solutions of some modification of al
bumen. The same compounds are formed by bringing the nitrate of
silver in contact with the cutis, which is generally considered to con
sist of gelatin, although it possesses most of the properties of albumen.
Until, however, we know what albumen is and are acquainted more
accurately with the nature of the causes which give rise to its modifi
cations, it will be in vain to attempt to assign any definite composition

to these compounds ; we can only study their physical and chemical
properties ; but this we can do most efficiently so as to render the facts
of great importance in a therapeutic point of view. From the facts
                 the author in respect to            foclolomwpionugndsconocfluasnioimnsa:l--mat

1 . That nitrate of silver acts as a caustic by combining with the ani
mal matter of the textures to which it is applied, probably in definite
proportions. The compounds are partly soluble and partly insoluble in
water, which renders them readily separable from the surface on which
they are produced. Cauterization               therefore, the removal of a por

2. When nitrate of silver taken into the stomach, chemical com

pounds of a similar nature are formed with solid matter dissolved in
the secretions, and with the food contained in that organ. Hence, no
nitrate of silver can ever reach the blood as nitrate of silver.
3. The author pointed out the importance of studying the action of
these compounds upon the constitution, and the fallacy of supposing
that nitrate of silver can act per se upon the animal ceconomy.

   On the occurrenceO.ofB.CrBysetlalilns gi?hi athme ,HuMm.Dan. Intestines.  By

      The author prefaced a description of the circumstances attending a
   case of this nature by a short review of the previous observations of
   Ehrenberg, who found microscopical crystals in the meconium ; Schon-
   bein, who found small crystals in the intestinal discharges of typhus
   patients, and imagined they might be considered as a diagnostic of ty
   phus ; and Miiller, who detected them in persons that died of various

   disorders.

      Dr. Bellingham's case was that of an individual (male), set. about 40,
   who died of pleuropneumonia and gastritis, in St. Vincent's Hospital,
   Dublin, after being admitted only a few days. On examining the in
   testinal canal, the contents of the colon were found to be very fluid,
   and of a lighter colour than usual. Suspended in the contents were
   numerous small hard parts, which proved to be crystals, somewhat less
   than the third of a line in length. Their colour was white (superfici
   ally yellowish), their form a slender four-sided prism, terminated by
   four-sided pyramids. On analysis, Dr. Apjohn found them to be com
   posed of phosphate of ammonia and magnesia, or the triple phosphate.
   They were found only in the colon.

       The author remarks, that the ammoniaco-magnesian phosphate found
   in the urinary bladder is usually formed in short three-sided prisms,
   terminated by three or six-sided pyramids.

      The composition of the crystals found by Schbnbein was very differ
   ent from these, consisting chiefly of phosphate of lime, some sulphate
   of lime, and a salt of soda, and presented the appearance of rhombs or
   rhombic prisms. In one case, however, he found four-sided prisms, and
   Dr. Bellingham remarks, that the triple phosphate has been frequently
   noticed in the intestinal secretions of quadrupeds, as by Fourcroy,
   Vauquelin, and Marcet.

            On Abscess of the Lungs. By Thomas Barnes, M.D.
      Regarding the frequency of this disease, a difference appears between

   the statements of ancient and modern medical authorities, the former
   affirming it to be of common occurrence, the latter uniformly asserting
   its rarity. The formation of an abscess in the lung being now con
   sidered so very rare, Dr. Barnes thought a brief account of two cases
   which lately occurred to himself worthy the attention of the Meeting.

      The first case was of a gentleman 40 years of age ; his disease ori
   ginated in influenza (Feb. 1837). He was of a sound and healthy con
   stitution, without any predisposition to phthisis or pulmonary disease,
   and in Aug. 1838 he had recovered ; but the symptoms he had suffered
   left no doubt in the minds of Dr. Barnes, Dr. Headlam, and Mr. Ed
   monson of the true nature of the disease.

      The second case is that of a stone-mason, aged 45, whose illness
   commenced on the 28th March, 1838, and was attributed by himself to

v

working in warm rooms, and throwing off his clothes when heated.
His disease proved fatal on the 18th May.

   The symptoms of treatment of each case, and the post mortem exa
mination of the latter by Dr. Elliot, were fully described.

   Mr. Owen commenced by showing, that he had availed himself of
the advantage afforded by the British Association, viz. that in the com
munications brought before a sectional committee, a fuller and more
detailed retrospect of the progressive steps which have led to any re
markable discovery, is not only permissible, but peculiarly congenial to
its general views and objects ; and he therefore entered into a full de
tail of the recent investigations, especially those of Purkinje, Miiller,
and Uetzius, on the intimate structure of the teeth, and particularly
dwelt on the discoveries of the latter author, as regarded the structure
of the human tooth. After describing the mode of arrangement of the
particles of the earthy salts, which characterizes true bone, Professor
Owen proceeded to state, that until a very recent period the analogy
of tooth to bone was supposed to extend no further than related to the
chemical composition of the hardening material, while the arrangement
of this earthy constituent, as well as its mode of deposition during the
growth of the entire tooth, were considered to be wholly different from
that of bone, and to agree with the mode of growth of hair, and other
so-called extra vascular parts, with which teeth in general closely cor
respond in their vital properties. He observed, that the supposed
proofs of the laminated structure of teeth, derived from the appear
ances presented by the teeth of growing animals, fed alternately with
madder and ordinary food, and by those which often occur during
the progress of decomposition of certain teeth, which are then resolved
into a series of concentric or superimposed lamina', were equally ap
plicable to true bone, and were quite unavailable in illustrating the
point under consideration ; and that the appearances presented by the
superficies of vertical sections of teeth, viewed with the naked eye or a
low magnifying power, were due, not to the intervals of separate and
superimposed lamella?, but to the different refractions of light, caused
by the parallel undulations or alternations of structure of minute tubes
proceeding in a contrary direction to the supposed lamellae. This ap
parent lamellatcd structure, however, is not constant, nor equally plain
in different teeth ; on the contrary, the fractured surface, or the polished
section of the human and many other teeth, presents a silky or irides
cent lustre, which lias attracted the attention of several anatomists. Pro
fessor Owen observed, that Malpighi, in whose works may be detected
the germs of several important anatomical truths, which have subse
quently been matured and established, conceived that the teeth were
composed of minute fibres reticularly interwoven ; and Leewenhoek, in
136 EIGHTH REPORT -- 1838.

1683, had discovered that the apparent fibres of tooth were, in reality,
minute tubes. The tubular structure of ivory was rediscovered by
Purkinje and Fraenkcl, in 1835, and the disposition of the tubes is ac
curately described and figured by them in the different kinds of human
teeth. In these descriptions the tubes are spoken of according to their
                                      as fibres,  but their true nature is explained in dif
prima   fapcaisesaagpepseaorafntchee   work*.
ferent                                             Purkinje and Fraenkel also added to
Dental Anatomy several new and interesting facts relating to the structure
of the enamel, pointing out more especially the form and characteristic
transverse stria of the component crystals : and, lastly, they determined
the true osseous nature of that distinct layer of substance which had
been previously known to surround the fang in the teeth of man, and
which they once observed to be continued upon the enamel of a hu
man incisor. This observation, Mr. Owen proceeded to state, he had
confirmed, and he exhibited several sections of the simple teeth of the

Mammalia in which both the ivory and enamel were invested by a layer
of osseous substance, identical in its structure with the cement which
enters more abundantly into the composition of the compound teeth of
the Herbivora.
The interesting experiments of Professor Muller, on the nature and
contents of the dental iubuli were then noticed ; and, lastly, a con
densed analysis was given of the laborious and accurate microscopical
observations of Professor Retzius, as related in the original Swedish
memoir of that author on the structure of teeth. Besides confirming
the fact, that the ivory or bony constituent of a human tooth consists of
minute tubes lodged in a transparent medium, disposed in a radiated
arrangement, with the lines proceeding in a direction perpendicular to
the superficies of the tooth, Professor Retzius has more particularly
observed and described the dichotomous branching of the primary
tubes ; the minuter ramuli sent off throughout the course of the main
tubes into the clear interspaces ; the calcigerous cells with which those
fine branches communicate; the terminal ramifications of the tubuli, and
their anastomoses with each other, and witli calcigerous cells at the
superficies of the ivory or bony part of the tooth. Professor Owen also
discussed the opinion advanced by Professor Retzius, as to the function
of this elaborate contexture of branched and anastomosing tubes and
cells, in conveying, by capillary attraction, a slow current of nutritive
or preservative fluid, through the entire substance of the tooth ; which
fluid might be derived either from the superficies of the pulp in the
internal cavity  ocfotrhtiecatloostuhb, stoarncferomorthceamcoernptuusmc,le--s

diating from which corpuscles, the fine terminal tubes of the ivory
anastomose. Professor Owen concluded the critical portion of his com
munication, by explaining the views entertained by Professor Retzius

on the analogy subsisting between tooth and bone, which analogy he
then proceeded to illustrate by his own observations on the structure
of recent and fossil teeth.

    With respect to the component structures of a tooth, Professor Owen
commenced by observing, that in addition to those usually described
and admitted, there were other substances entering into the composi
tion of teeth, and presenting microscopic characters equally distinct
both from ivory, enamel, and cement, and from true bone, and as easily
recognisable.
   One of these substances was characterized by being traversed through

other, and presenting more or fewer dichotomous divisions. The canals
in many cases are surrounded by concentric lamellae, and thus resemble
very closely the Haversian canals of true bone ; but the calcigerous
tubes which everywhere radiate from them are relatively much larger.
The highly-organized tooth-substance just described differs from true
osseous substance, and from the caementum, in the absence of the
Purkingian corpuscles or cells. This structure is exemplified in the
teeth of many fishes and of some of the Edentate Mammalia.

   Another component substance of tooth more closely resembles true

bone and cement, inasmuch as the Purkingian cells are abundantly
scattered through it ; it differs, however, in the greater number and
close parallel arrangement of the medullary canals. This structure is
exhibited in the teeth of the Megatherium, Mylodon, and other extinct
Edentata.

   Mr. Owen then proceeded to describe the modifications of the above-
mentioned dental substances in the teeth of different classes of the ver

tebrate   animals,  oFfiswhehsic.h--tWheithfollroewspiencgt  examples are selected.   the      low

character of true bone, and being in many species fixed by anchylosis
or continuity of substance with the bones supporting them.

   It was in the teeth of fishes that, in recent times, the tubular struc
ture had been first recognised. Cuvier*, e. g. describes them as pre
senting three different structures, of which one kind (Jes composees)
are formed of an infinity of tubes, all united and terminated by a com
mon covering of enamel ; of this kind he instances the tesselated teeth
                                   as those of Hays.

as being composed of hollow fibres f, and he compares these hollow
fibres, or tubes, to those which enter into the composition of the teeth
of the Orycteropus, &c.
The tubes here spoken of, as well as those mentioned by Cuvier, are

sufficiently large to be distinguished by the naked eye ; they do not,
however, form the constituent texture of the teeth instanced, but only
the coarser part of that texture. They contain a vascular medulla,

they are, therefore, analogous to the simple pulp-canal of the human
incisor, which, with its radiating microscopic calcigerous tubes, may be
compared to a single medullary canal with its corresponding microsco

                --A
by a low power of an inch focus, exhibits at its base a coarse network
of large irregular canals, filled with a vascular medullary pulp. From
this network, smaller medullary canals proceed in a slightly-diverging
course, subdividing dichotomously with interspaces equal to six or eight
of their own diameters. In a transverse section of the tooth, seen under
the same power, the area of the medullary canals is seen to present ge
nerally an elliptical form, from which radiating calcigerous tubes are
/aintly perceptible. Each canal and its series of tubes is surrounded
by a line of generally an hexagonal form, and which constitutes the
boundary between contiguous canals and tubes, the whole tooth being
thus composed of an aggregate of simple elongated, commonly six-sided
prismatic teeth, placed vertically to the grinding surface. A section
through the roots of the tooth shows that these parts are occupied by a
network of irregular canals, which anastomose by arched branches
with the network of the contiguous root, and these with the network
of coarser tubes which occupy the basis of the tooth for an extent ex
ceeding the length of the root itself.
   With a higher power, -r^th inch focus, the calcigerous tubes are seen

to radiate in all directions from the medullary canals, and are sent off
throughout the whole course of the canal. The tubes are short, wavy,
richly arborescent, and form numerous anastomoses with each other.
The transverse sections of the tooth show that the area of each medul

lary canal has been filled up or diminished by the deposition of a
series of concentric lamellae.

   The ramification of the tubes in this tooth presents the same general
character as those of Acrodus, but they are shorter, and each group in

the transverse section is separated from the contiguous one by the re

gular boundary lines above-mentioned, which distinguish the teeth of
the Myliobatis from those of the Acrodus, Psammodus, Cestracion, or
any of the shark tribe. The tooth of the Orycteropus is that which
has the nearest resemblance to the tooth of the Myliobatis.

   Acrodus nobilis.--The crushing teeth of this extinct genus are coin-
posed of two substances, viz. a thin external almost colourless layer,
which represents the enamel, and an amber-coloured coarser ivory
composing the body of the tooth, and continuous with and passing into
the coarse cellular bony basis and support of the tooth. Microscopic
sections of this tooth afford the most beautiful appearances, and, per
haps, the most instructive illustration of the relation of ivory to bone.
The body of the tooth consists of groups of beautifully branched and
irregularly wavy medullary canals imbedded in a clear matrix. These

canals are surrounded by concentric strata, and closely resemble the
canals of Havers in true bone. The calcigerous tubes, which radiate

from the medullary canals, have a graceful undulatory course and are

tubes are all directed, as in true ivory, at right angles to the superfi
cies, and thus constitute a regular layer of calcigerous tubes, disposed
so as to offer the greatest resistance to pressure. This layer is equal
in thickness to about one-fifteenth part of the vertical diameter of the
thickest part of the tooth.

  The finest or terminal branches of this peripheral layer of tubes, I
have traced in various places into what at first sight appears to be the
enamel. Under a magnifying power of 400 diameters, however, this out
ermost layer is seen to be composed of extremely minute tubes, -nyW tu °'"
a line in diameter ; they are branched like the coarser tubes of the body of
the tooth ; irregularly wavy in their course ; having a general tendency

to an arrangement at right angles to the superficies, but inextricably
interwoven, and connected anastomotically together, so as to require a

strong light to penetrate even the thinnest section, and render their

structure and arrangement visible. The continuation of these finer

superficial tubes, with the coarser tubes of the body of the tooth, is best
observed by changing the focus, which brings the transitional tubes at
different depths in the section into view. In some parts of the section,
a medullary or Haversian canal is displayed longitudinally ; and the
parallel lines of the surrounding concentric strata on each side are ex
hibited. The canal maintains a general uniform diameter, but slightly
dilates where it divides or sends off a cross branch to communicate

with the adjoining canals. These canals commence from the large cells
of the bone of the base, and pass into the substance of the tooth to

wards its periphery ; communicate by transverse canals, but all ulti

visible, if at all. They are discernible in some situations crossing the
concentric lamellae at right angles to the central canal. The chief dif
ference between the appearance presented by the Haversian canals of
the tooth of Acrodus, and those in true bone, is in the absence of the
cells or corpuscles. These are apparent only at the base of the tooth --
irregular in size and form, very minute, and appearing like simple gra
nules without radiating lines. The character of the main or coarser
canals and calcigerous tubes of the ivory of the tooth of Acrodus, re
poses on their undulating course, their rapid diminution and branclrng,

and the moderately acute angles at which the branches are given off,
except at the circumference of the tooth, where they run nearly parallel
to each other. Iu other parts they closely resemble the branching of
trees. The line of demarcation between the coarser and finer ivory is
formed by a series of small cells of a similar granular appearance to
those at the base, in which many of the finer branches of the course
ivory terminate, and from which the minute tubes of the enamel-like

ivory commence. The superficies of the tooth is slightly punctated,
but the depressions do not correspond with the mouths of tubes, bui
with the interspaces of whole groups of the coarser tubes.

  ifPsammodus A transverse section of the tooth of this genus pre

sents the appearance, under a moderate magnifying power, as it were
composed of close-set coarse tubes, the arose of which were thus ex
posed. Such a section, viewed with a power of 4-00 diameters, shows

that these tubes are surrounded by concentric lamellae, exactly as the
Haversian canals; and that these lamellae, and the clear interspace,
which is generally equal to the thickness of the lamellae, are permeated
by minute irregularly disposed tubes, which anastomose in the clear
interspace, and open into extremely minute cells, scattered in the same

part. A longitudinal section of the same tooth shows the whole course
of the canals ; they run nearly perpendicularly to the convex super

ficies of the tooth, and, consequently, incline outwards at the sides of
the section. They lie nearly parallel with each other, with interspaces
equal to from 6 to 8 times their own diameter, and branch diehoto-
mously once or twice    in their course. Each canal is surrounded
concentric layers of a                                               by
                        dark colour, encroaching upon one-third of  the

interspace, which thus presents two dark streaks and one intermediate
right line: the whole of these interspaces is perforated by the irregular
wavy, branched, anastomosing calcigerous tubes. The tenninations of
the canals near the periphery of the tooth are slightly dilated, and give
off in every direction calcigerous tubes corresponding to those in the
interspace of the canals. The structure of the tooth of Psammodus
differs from that of Acrodus in the greater number and more parallel
course of the canals, their fewer branches, and want of anastomoses,
and in the absence of a distinct external enamel-like layer of very fine

tubes.

   Ptychodus lalissimus. --The structure of this tooth has a close affinity
to that of Psammodus : it is composed of Haversian canals and cal
cigerous tubes proceeding therefrom. The base of the tooth is com

being given off at more open angles, and the terminal ones being larger
in proportion to the trunks. The papillose surface of the tooth is com
posed of the tenninations of the inextricably interwoven fine calci
gerous tubes given off from the terminations of the canals. The inter
spaces of the canals are also occupied by the same minute anastomosing
reticulate tube-work. Numerous minute calcigerous cells are also
present in the interspaces. There is a clear substance coating the
grinding surface of the tooth, in which neither tubes nor any definite
structure could be detected, though, from analogy, such doubtless
exist. The darker substance, forming the concentric lamellae around
the canals, occupies the same proportion of their interspace as in the
Psammodus.

viewed with the naked eye, to be composed of a close-set series of pa
rallel coarse tubes, dividing dichotomously, and united together here
and there by short transverse arches with the convexity towards the
grinding surface. The diameter of the interspaces of these canals is
generally equal to between two and three diameters of their area?.
Viewed by a higher power, the tubes are seen to be immediately
surrounded by a clear amber-coloured substance, analogous to that

Iwhich forms the concentric layers around the canals, which have
compared to those described by Havers in true bone.
Under a power of 4-00, the large canals are seen to send off from
every part of their course numerous minute tubes, generally at right
angles, to the medullary canals ; these tubes run irregularly, ramify,
and anastomose in the interspaces of the medullary canals, and form a
coarse matting or plexus of tubes, the number of which sometimes

quite intercepts the light.
In the teeth of the genus Lamna, a number of medullary canals are
continued from the short and small pulp-cavity at the base of the tooth,
which ramify and anastomose, so as to form a beautiful reticulate
arrangement of tubes, very similar to a network of capillary vessels,
throughout the whole substance of the tooth : they ultimately termi
nate in a flattened sinus, which seems to extend over the whole tooth

at a very short distance from its superficies. The whole of the super
ficial part of the tooth is occupied by minute calcigerous tubes, which

proceed in a wavy course, generally at right angles to the external
surface ; they ramify, and their terminal branches anastomose, and
many of them terminate in a stratum of calcigerous cells, situated be
tween the body of the tooth and what appears to be the outer stratum
of enamel. In this stratum, however, there are evident traces of a
series of much finer tubes, continued from the preceding layer of cells,
which proves that this is not true enamel, but a fine kind of ivory, like
that in the tooth of the sloth and megatherium. The coarse reticulate
canals in the body of the tooth are surrounded by concentric layers,
traversed by the calcigerous tubes which are everywhere given off at
right angles from the larger canals ; these canals are occupied, in the

recent fish, by a sanguineous medulla, closely resembling that which
fills the medullary cells of the coarse bone, to which the base of the
tooth is anchylosed, and with which cells the anastomosing reticulate
canals of the   toMoethgaaJoredodnir.--ectTlyhecocnatlcinigueoruosu.s

this tooth are disposed in groups which, with an insufficient magnifying
power, appear like single coarse tubes, but with a higher power, are
seen to be composed of congeries of parallel tubes, apparently twisted
together. The interspaces arc nearly equal to the diameter of these
curious fasciculi : they are occupied by more scattered tubes, and by
short oblique or transverse anastomosing branches. At one part of a
section of this tooth, the peripheral coarse sinus or canal, which always
runs parallel with the superficies, gave off an infinite number of minute
tubes, which formed a plexus, (or plexiform stratum,) and from the
outer part of this plexus, the tubes above described passed, at right

angles, to the surface. In the longitudinal section of this tooth, the
twisted appearance, above described, of the peripheral calcigerous tubes,
was seen to be due to the number of side branches given off at an
acute angle to the main tube. At the apex the tubes radiate, and sud
denly diverge to proceed transversely to the sides. In the body of the
tooth the main canals are surrounded by concentric lamella?, traversed
by radiating and anastomosing calcigerous tubes, which form a fine net
work in the interspaces.
   Dictyodus, a sphyrenoid         genus. --The  body  of  the  conical  maxillary

teeth of this fossil species presents a beautiful assemblage of medullary
canals, having a general parallel course from the basis to the apex, divi
ding and subdividing as they approach the latter, with interspaces gene
rally equal to three or four of their own diameters, and anastomosing by
short branches crossing the interspaces, and thus intercepting quadran
gular, sub-elliptical, pentagonal, or hexagonal spaces, elongated in the
axis of the tooth, but becoming shorter as they approach the apex,
which presents the appearance of a coarse irregular lace-work. The
interior of some of the larger canals is occupied with a granular matter.

   I have been able to detect the fine calcigerous tubes only at the cir
cumference of the tooth radiating from the peripheral side of the su
perficial canal into the clear enamel-like coating of the tooth. They

immediately begin to ramify at acute angles.
   The larger canals are continued directly from the coarse medullary
cells at the bony base of the tooth : the longitudinal ones are mostly
larger than the transverse or oblique short anastomosing canals. This
tooth resembles in general structure that of the Anarrhichas Lupus.

   The round pharyngeal teeth of the extinct genus Spherrodus are
anchylosed to a bone of a cellular structure. The body of the tooth
consists of coarse tubes, which arise insensibly from the basis, where
they have a diameter of j^^tli of an inch, and proceed directly and
perpendicularly to the surface of the tooth. The characteristics of

these tubes are, first, that they are so closely arranged together, that

only one-fourth of their own diameter intervenes between them at their
origins. Secondly, they present the appearance of a closely-twisted
bundle of smaller tubes, and begin immediately to give off short and

somewhat coarse branches at very acute angles ; these branches increase
in number, and the trunks proportionally diminish, until they have
traversed two-thirds of the vertical diameter of the tooth ; they resolve
themselves into fasciculi of extremely minute twigs, which interlace
together, and in many places dilate into, or communicate with, nu
merous minute calcigerous cells, and form so dense a layer as to inter
cept the light, excepting towards the circumference of the tooth, and
consequently at the two extremities of the section, where only the

structure above described is visible. Several small twigs pass beyond
this plexus into the clear enamel-like outer layer of the tooth, in some
parts of which traces are perceptible of a plexus of still more minute
tubes, or stria, which gradually diminished until they escaped the

genus, e.g. Lepid. Filtoni, correspond so closely in size and form with
those of the preceding genus, (Sph&rodus,) as not to be distinguishable
from them but by a comparison of their microscopic structure. They
are composed of fasciculate tubes continued directly from the cells of
the osseous base, radiating, with a direction vertical to the surface of
the tooth, and giving off branches, at an acute angle, from their very
commencement : thus far the general character of the texture of the

tooth is the same ; but the fine branches into which the fasciculate

tubes resolve themselves, diverge at a much more open angle from the
main trunk, are spread out more widely, have a more wavy course, and
present the appearance of corn beaten down with heavy rain. These
five terminal branches are inextricably interwoven, and present the ap
pearance of numerous anastomoses, but do not form so dense a structure

a large and simple pulp-cavity, presenting a quadrate figure in a ver
tical section of the tooth ; this cavity is immediately continuous with
the large cells and reticulate canals of the bony base. The body of
the tooth consists of close-set minute calcigerous tubes, having a dia
meter of 7^j,th of a line at their origin, radiating in a direct line, but
with a minute and regularly undulating course, and a gradually dimi

nishing diameter to the superficies : the lateral tubes pass horizontally,
those continued from the summit of the pulp-cavity vertically, to the
grinding surface. They give off very regular, but extremely minute
branches, which are lost in the clear and dense enamel-like superficial
layer of the tooth.
    Barbel. Pharyngeal     tooth. -- In this tooth  the structure character

istic of the ivory of the simple mammalian tooth is beautifully dis
played. The cavity of the pulp is single, elongated and narrow, and
the tubes radiate to the surface of the tooth at right angles to that sur
face, and chiefly, therefore at right angles to the axis of the tooth.

The tubes are minute and numerous, beautifully and regularly undu
lating, seldom dividing, and then dichotomously, each branch proceed

ing nearly in the direction of the trunk. A detached fossil pharyngeal
tooth of this kind would be distinguishable from a mammalian carni
vorous tooth of similar form by the circumstance, that in the tooth of
the fish the pulp-cavity becomes directly continuous with the coarse cells
and medullary canals of the bone with which it is anchylosed ; the base
of the tooth is not diminished to a fang, and the calcigerous tubes are
larger and more irregular the closer they are to the base of the tooth.
   The large conical carnivorous teeth of the extinct genera Holopty-
i-lnix and Megalichthys present a similar grade of structure to that of
the pharyngeal tooth above described. The whole body of the tooth is
here composed of minute close-set calcigerous tubes, having a diameter
of -reWth of a line in diameter, with interspaces of nearly twice that
diameter. The calcigerous tubes have a minutely undulated course,
144 EIGHTH REPORT -- 1838.

and pass in nearly a straight line from the internal to the external sur
face of the tooth : the pulp-cavity extends about half-way through the
body of the tooth, and has a narrow elliptic transverse section ; it be
comes gradually smaller at the base of the tooth, and there branches
out into several processes, which are continued into the cylindrical
processes of the dental substance, which are imbedded, like so many
piles, in the coarse osseous texture of the jaw. It is this peculiar mode
of fixation of the tooth to the jaw-bone that would serve at once to

distinguish the tooth of Holoplychiis from that of any saurian or main-
miferous species which it might resemble in external form.

   In not any of the teeth of fishes above described was there an ex
ternal covering of enamel, presenting the characteristic transversely-
striated prismatic crystalline structure which distinguishes the enamel
of the higher Vertebrata. In all cases, where structure could be de
tected in the dense exterior layer representing the enamel, it presented
the organized tubular character, differing from the subjacent ivory
only in the more minute size of the tubes.

   Of the teeth of reptiles, l'rof. Owen described those of several genera,
recent and fossil. In the Sharp-iwscd Alligator (C'rocodilus acutus),
the exposed part of the tooth is covered with true enamel, and that part
which is lodged in the socket is coated with a layer of ccementum. The
tubuli are very fine, not exceeding at the widest part yn'oo*'1 of a line.
With a low magnifying power they appear to radiate in straight lines
from the cavitas pulpi to the superficies of the tooth, proceeding at
right angles to that surface : under a higher power, they are seen to
be slightly undulating, and to have interspaces equal to five times their
own diameters. The main tubes begin to divide soon after their origin,
and the branches diverge from each other ; these send off numerous
finer ramuli, which are generally turned towards the root: these ter
minate or dilate, in many places, into calcigerous cells, which form
numerous layers, generally arranged parallel with the contour of the
cavity of the pulp, and most numerous at the circumference of the
ivory. It is to these layers of calcigerous cells, and to the parallel cur
vatures of the tubes, that the apparent laminated structure is seen to
be due, when sections of these teeth are examined with a low magnifying
power. A thin membrane lines the cavity of the pulp of even the oldest

teeth.

   The fossil teeth of the extinct Reptiles reveal an equally complicated
structure. The fang of the fluted teeth of the Ichthyosaurus is covered
with a thick layer of camentum, which fills the interstices of the
grooves. The tubuli of the ivory-constituent are extremely minute ;
they resemble in their arrangement and ramification those of the cro
codile, but the undulations are more numerous and more marked.

   In the Igitanodon, the ivory is composed of close- set tubes, radiating
in a wavy course from the cavitas pulpi to the superficies : each tube
is also minutely undulating. They are coarser than those of the Ich
thyosaurus ; and the ivory further differs in the presence of large me
dullary canals, which are seen here and there radiating from the cavity
of the pulp, and traversing the dense ivory.

In the class Mammalia the teeth of the animals belonging to the
order called Edentata by Cuvier, present the nearest resemblance to
the vascular and organized structures above described in the teeth of
cartilaginous fishes. The close resemblance, in this respect, between
the teeth of Orycteropus and Myliobatis has already been alluded to,
but their outward form and mode of attachment are widely different.
The teeth of Orycteropus present the form either of a simple cylinder,
or of two joined laterally together. In these, as in the tesselated teeth
of the Rays, Cuvier had recognised a tubular structure ; but the tubes
described by that great anatomist were merely the medullary or pulp-
canals which run parallel with the axis of the tooth, at regular distances
from each other. These visible medullary canals, which are widest at
the base of the tooth, diminish at first rapidly, and afterwards very
gradually in diameter, and some of them divide dichotomously in their
course from the base to the grinding-surface of the tooth. Throughout
their course they send off at right angles and from every part of their
circumference the true calcigerous dental tubes. These tubes, at their
origin are 7^jth of a line in diameter, but quickly diminish, as they pro
ceed in a wavy course to the interspace which divides them from the
contiguous medullary canals and their systems of calcigerous tubes : the
tubes give off numerous branches, which form, near the boundary space,
a moss-like reticulation of extremely fine tubes. Nearly the whole ex
tent of the medullary canal is occupied with a vascular pulp, and its
parietes near the base is likewise surrounded with a thin vascular cap
sule ; the whole tooth is in fact composed of a closely-packed congeries
of slender prismatic elongated miniature simple teeth, each of which is
provided with its pulp and capsule, its medullary cavity, and its radiated
series of calcigerous tubes. The capsule of each component prismatic
tooth becomes ossified at a little distance from the base of the tooth.
A transverse section of the whole compound tooth above this part pre
sents a series of hexagonal, pentagonal, or tetragonal groups of cal
cigerous tubes radiating from an elliptical space occupied by a vascular
pulp, and separated from each other by a thin boundary line of bone
or ccementum, characterized by the presence of Purkingian corpuscles.
The vascular pulp, likewise, becomes ossified near the grinding-surface
of the tooth, and consequently a transverse section taken near this part
presents the centres of the radiation of the calcigerous tubes filled up
with bone or

part of the pulp-cavity, those in the middle proceeding parallel to the
axis of the tooth, those at the circumference curving outwards. These
canals are unequal, presenting partial dilatations, which, however, are
sometimes, though rarely, discernible in the tubuli of human teeth ;
they give off numerous tortuous branches of different sizes, and these

of the large canals of the central substance, and terminated in plexus of

still finer tubes, which at length escape the highest magnifying powers.

tooth of this extinct mammifer have undeceived me with respect to its

conformation ; the thin dense layer between the crusta petrosa and the
internal substance composing the body of the tooth is not enamel, but
a layer of ivory composed, like the dense ivory of the teeth of other
Mammalia, of minute tubes having a parallel course at right angles to

the surface, and minutely undulating in that course, and corresponding
with the thin cylinder of true ivory in the tooth of the sloth. The cen
tral part of the body of the tooth consists of a coarser ivory, much

resembling the teeth of Psammodus or Myliobatis, among fishes. It is
traversed by large medullary canals parallel to each other and to the
finer ivory tubes, having angular interspaces equal to one and a half
diameter of their own area, and generally anastomosing in pairs by a

loop whose convexity is close to the origin of the fine ivory tubes, as if
each pair so joined was composed of one reflected canal. Some, how
ever, are continued across the fine ivory, and anastomose with the corre
sponding canals of the ccementum ; the interspaces of the coarse ivory
tubes appear at first view granular, but they are principally occupied
by reticular branches given off from the canals : some of these anasto
mosing branches are seen coming off from the concavity of the loops,
and retrograding. Numerous minute cells are scattered about the ter
minal loops of the medullary canals of the coarser ivory. The origin
of the fine ivory tubes is from the convexity of the peripheral loops of
the above medullary canals. The ivory tubes are separated by inter
spaces equal to one and a half their own diameter ; they divide and
subdivide, growing smaller and more wavy towards the periphery or
cmrnentum ; here their terminal branches assume a bent direction, and
form anastomoses, dilate into small cells, and many are clearly seen to
become continuous with the radiating fibres or tubes of the corpuscles
of the contiguous ccementum.                         The cement is traversed by large canals

from the coarse ivory in the fewer number of canals, and more espe
cially by the presence of the bone corpuscles or radiated cells in the
interspaces of the canals. The irregular tortuous fine tubes forming a
network in the interspaces, and especially those proceeding from the
convexities of the loops, are much more distinct than the correspond

off generally at right angles. In a few places have distinctly seen
the large canals of the ccementum traversing the substance of the fine
ivory to anastomose with those of the central coarse ivory.
   We have thus, then, in the tooth of the Megatherium, an unequivo

superadded to that which proceeds from the surface of the pulp and
the cavity of the fang in which it is lodged, viz. by a direct communi

with the cells and tubes of the ivory, so that this part can obtain from
without the requisite humours after the central pulp has almost ceased

The views entertained by Cuvier of the affinity of Megatherium to
Bradypus, derive full confirmation from the microscopic investigation

of its teeth. It needs but to compare the preceding description with
that published by Retzius of the structure of the teeth of'the Armadillo,

to perceive how much more closely the Megathere resembles the Sloth
in the structure of its teeth. The Megatherium has ten teeth in the
upper jaw, five on each side ; differing slightly in form and size, but all
presenting the same characteristic vascular structure as above described.
The structure of the coarse central ivory may be compared with that of
which the entire     tooth of the Orycteropus is composed,                                    with   these dif

mosing and communicating with minute calcigerous cells immediately
beneath the enamel.

   The teeth of those orders of Mammalia in which they present the
usual structure of compact ivory, enamel, and camentum, have been
described in several genera with so much accuracy by Professor Retzitts,
that there are few modifications or examples worthy of particular at

tention.

   In the simple teeth of the Marsupial animals, the external layer of
ccementum covering the enamelled crown is thicker in many of the
species than is usually seen. The Phalangers, Koala, and Wonibat,
offer good examples of the superficial layer of cement on the exposed
crown. It possesses the usual high degree of organization, and abounds
in the Purkingian cells.

   In the incisors of the Orang-Utan, the main calcigerous tubes of the
ivory, which radiate from the central cavity of the pulp, are somewhat
larger than those of man ; they present the same primary curvatures,

but less numerous and less strongly -marked secondary undulations*.
In the crown of the tooth of the Orang, the dental tubes are chiefly
branched at their extremities, while towards the apex of the fang the
main tubes are surrounded by exceedingly fine and close-set branches,
which subdivide in their course. The nearer the crown, the larger are
these branches ; they are curved, with the concavity towards the pulp.

   In the summary of this series of observations which Professor Owen
detailed, he observed, that in the human and similarly organized teeth,
the analogy of ivory to bone, as to texture, was only seen in the ex
istence and intercommunication of the minute calcigerous tubes and
cells ; but that there was no trace of medullary or Haversian canals,
with their characteristic concentric laminae, unless the entire tooth
were regarded as analogous to a single enlarged Haversian canal, when
the cavity of the simple pulp would represent the medullary cavity of
the canal ; while the tubes, with the appearance of lamina; occasioned
by their undulations, might be deemed equivalent to the concentric la
mellae and the calcigerous tubes, which, in bone, traverse these lamellae,
and radiate from the Haversian canal. In the teeth of many of the
lower animals, however, and especially that of the extinct Acrodus,
amongst the cartilaginous fishes, the resemblance of the dental tissue
to bone was extended to the existence of the characteristic Haversian
canals in great numbers. The presence of these canals was explained
by the progress of the development of these bone-like teeth, as observed
by Professor Owen in recent cartilaginous fishes. The large pulp, at
the commencement of the formation of the tooth, had exercised its
ordinary function in the secretion of a close-set series of calcigerous

    * The primary curvatures Professor Owen explained to be those which belong to
 the general course of the dental tube, and which are seen with a lower power ; in
 man they resemble the curves of the Greek Zeta (?). The secondary curves are mi
nute undulations in the whole course of the tube, requiring a high power for their
 perception, and affecting both the main trunks and their branches ; these probably
indicate and are due to the movements of the formative pulp during the deposition ot
the ivorv.

tubes, having a general direction perpendicular to the surface of the
tooth, and closely resembling true ivory. The pulp then, instead of
continuing to form similar tubular ivory, by adding to the extremities
of the previously formed tubes, became subdivided, or broken up into
numerous processes, to which those forming the three fangs of a hu
man grinder are analogous. But each process here becomes the centre
of an active formation of similar branched tubes, radiating in all di
rections from that centre, and anastomosing by their peripheral branches
with those from contiguous centres, or communicating with interposed
calcigerous cells. The cavities containing the above subdivisions of the
pulp, like the Haversian canals containing the processes of medulla in
true bone, have had their area diminished in like manner by the suc
cessive formation of a series of concentric lamellae, traversed, as in

true bone, by radiating and minutely ramified calcigerous tubes, com
municating with each other and with the minute cells in the inter
spaces. The resemblance between the pulp canals of the teeth of
Acrodus and of the medullary canals of bones, is further exemplified
in the existence of lateral communications in teeth ; and in function as
well as structure they may be regarded as being identical.
   With reference to the application of the tubular structure of the
teeth to the explanation of their pathology, Professor Owen observed,
that it was a new and fertile field, which would doubtless be replete
with interesting results, and might suggest some good practical im
provements in dental surgery. Ordinary decay of the teeth com
menced, in the majority of instances, immediately beneath the enamel,
in the fine ramifications of the peripheral extremities of the tubes, and
proceeded in the direction of the main tubes, and, consequently, by
the most direct route to the cavity of the pulp. The decayed sub
stance, in some instances, retains the characteristic tubular structure,

which is also observable in the animal basis of healthy teeth after the
artificial removal of the earthy salts. The soft condition of the de
cayed portion of a tooth is well known to all dentists ; it depends upon
the removal of the earthy salts from the containing tubes and cells, in
which process the decay of teeth essentially consists. The main ob
ject of the dentist, in reference to ordinary caries of the teeth, seems,
therefore, to be, to detect those appearances in the enamel which in
dicate the commencement of decay -- to break away the enamel, whose

and fill up the cavity with incorrodible substance. Experience proves,
what could not be intelligibly explained before the true structure of
the dental substance was known, viz. that the progress of the decay is
sometimes thus permanently arrested. Such cases sometimes exhibit
a thin dense layer of ivory in contact with the stopping, apparently re
sulting from an exudation of the calcareous salts from the extremities
of the tubes divided in the operation.
   In conclusion, Professor Owen passed in general review over the
structures which he had described in detail. He particularly pointed
out the important application of the microscopic examination of thin

On  the   Use   of  Wire  Ropes in Deep Mines.  By Count Augustus
                                   Breunner.

There had been introduced into the silver mines of the Hartz Moun
tains, about seven years ago, ropes composed of twisted iron wire, as a
substitute for the flat ropes previously in use. Since that time they
have been adopted throughout the mines of Hungary and most of those
in the Austrian dominions, to the almost total exclusion of flat and
round ropes made of hemp. These iron ropes are of equal strength
with a hempen rope of four times the weight. One has been in use
upwards of two years without any 'perceptible wear, whereas a flat
rope performing similar work would not have lasted much more than a
single year. The diameter of the largest rope in ordinary use in the
deepest mines of Austria is one inch and a half. This rope is com
posed of  iron                         in diameter \five  of these  are braided
          into  wires, each two lines                     twisted   tightly into
together                               these strands are
                strands, and three of
a rope. Great care is requisite in making the rope that the ends of
the wires be set deep in the interior of the rope, and that no two ends
meet near the same part. The strength of these ropes is little less than
that of a solid iron bar of the same diameter. The usual weight lifted
is 1000 lbs. The rope on leaving the shaft must be received on a cy
linder of not less than eight feet diameter, and be kept well coated with
tar. There is a saving of about one-third of the power in one case
mentioned, for four   horses with a wire rope are  doing the same work
                                                    by Count Breunner,
as six horses with a  flat rope. It was suggested
that the substitution of iron ropes for the flat ropes in our deep mines
and coal-pits would be attended with the same, if not greater ad
vantages than have attended their introduction into the mines of the

Austrian dominions.

peculiar ' lamination' of the timber in the arches, by which, along
with other advantages, a decided advantage is gained in strength.is

    With a model upon this principle for a bridge across the Tyne
1 20 feet span, experiments were made in the presence of part of the
managing directors of the railway, and some scientific persons, which
proved highly satisfactory; for a weight of 250 stone was placed
upon without the slightest deflexion of the arch being perceptible.
This, multiplied by 144, according to the scale of the model, gives
34,900 stone, or upwards of 218 tons, as the weight the arch of 120 feet

would bear without being affected. A great surplus strength was

therefore manifest, to cover all contingencies, and make allowances for
the increased span and extra dimensions.

    The plans and elevations of two viaducts at Ouseburn and Willing-
ton Dean were laid before the section. The former, at the eastern
suburb of Newcastle, 920 feet in length and 108 feet in height there
are five arches, of 16 feet span each, and two stone arches, at each end,
of 45 feet span each. These were introduced in order to prevent the
mounds coming too close upon the very steep banks of the ravine.
The latter bridge 1150 feet long, and consists of seven arches, 120
feet span each. The height up to the roadway 82 feet. Stone
arches were not requisite here, as the banks are of a more gradual

thickness. Between every deal layer of brown paper, dipped in boiling

above and below it. Those above are perpendicular to the longitudi
nal beams of the roadway, and those below are radiating to the centre

of the arch.
152 EIGHTH REPORT -- 163S.

   The longitudinal beams under the roadwciy are 14 inches square ;
and transverse joists, 3 feet 6 inches apart, and projecting about 2 feet
on each side, are laid across to receive the 3-inch planking, which
is covered with a composition to form a roadway.

    The rails for the locomotive engine and train are raised above the
planks about 8 inches, on longitudinal beams or sleepers of timber,

about 12 inches by 6. A strong framed railing is then fixed along
each side, the length of the bridge, and completes the structure.

    The spandril framing is connected and bound, both to the roadway
and to the ribs, by means of iron bolts, straps, and keys, in the different
situations shown on the model. One of the radiating struts in each
spandril is carried on from the rib to the longitudinal beams, and con
nected thereto, and to the masonry, by bolts passing through and run
down the piers about 8 feet.

    In this system of timber bridge building, the straight trussing in the
main principle of support is dispensed with ; for the spandril framing
must not be looked upon as such ; it is merely a combination of wood
work, to convey the weight coming upon the roadway on to the sim
ple curved rib ; and all timbers in a state of tension are avoided ; for
when a weight comes upon the roadway, the whole structure under

goes compression.

   Mr. Green has also applied this laminating principle to a more durable
material, viz. iron, and he described the modifications which this appli
cation rendered necessary, and the advantages it offered.

Outline  of  the  PPrientceiprlesNicohf o(hlesoOnb.lique  Arch.

             By

The oblique arch is an invention of comparatively recent date; but
the general use of the locomotive engine rendering it urgent to pre
serve the most direct line for railways, has caused the general adoption
of oblique bridges on all the lines of railway now in progress, and
it has become a matter of importance that the theory of their con
struction should be fully understood.
The principles of the oblique arch which the author proposes for
the guidance of engineers, require that five of the faces of each stone
be prepared in such a manner that four of them shall recede from
the fifth ; and, when the stones are arranged in courses, the surfaces of
the fifth face shall form one continued cylindric surface, which is the
intrados, and the other four surfaces shall form the beds and ends of
the stones on which they join each other. In every course two of the
opposite surfaces of the first stone, two of the opposite surfaces of the
second stone, and so on, shall form two continued surfaces throughout
Ifthe whole length of each course ; and the edge of each of these con
tinued surfaces in the intrados shall be a spiral line.   a straight line
be drawn through any point in one of the spiral lines, perpendicular to
the axis of the cylinder, the straight line shall coincide with that con
tinued surface which is a bed of that course, and the straight line thus
                      TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                          153

drawn shall be perpendicular to a plane which is a tangent to the
curved surface of the cylinder at that point in the spiral line ; there
fore the straight line thus drawn shall be perpendicular to another
straight line which is a tangent to the spiral line at that point.
    When the intrados is developed, the spiral lines which form the edges
of the courses shall be parallel, and their distances shall be equal ; and
the spiral lines which are the edges of the ends of the stones shall be
developed in straight lines perpendicular to those lines which are the
developments of the spirals of the edges of the courses.

   It is evident that each of these spiral lines will have a certain radius
of curvature, and that this radius of curvature, at any point of the spiral
line, will be equal to the radius of curvature at any other point in the
same spiral ; and that the radius of curvature at any two given points
in two spiral lines which have parallel developments, are equal to one

another.
   Therefore, if two points be taken in a spiral line, and if a straight
line be drawn from one of them parallel to the axis, and through the
other, the cylinder be cut by a plane perpendicular to the axis, and if
                                                  ;

                                                                        if,
the surface of the cylinder be developed the development will be a
right angled triangle, of which the quotient arising, by dividing the
product of the square of the hypothenuse and the radius of the cylin
der by the square of the development of the circular arc intercepted
between the spiral and the straight line, will be the radius of curvature

of that spiral.
   By these principles the geometrical construction of an oblique arch

may be easily made for the use of the workmen, or calculations of all the
parts may be expeditiously and accurately performed by the engineer

   The principle of this method consists in making one woodcut, which
represents a plan or projection of any piece of machinery. Several
stereotype plates are then taken from this block, from each of which
various parts of the mechanism are cut out, leaving only such parts as
may be clearly understood together.
   The author illustrated this plan by impressions from several compli
cated woodcuts, intended for the description of his calculating engine.
From one of these originals five stereotype plates had been taken and
properly prepared. By removing certain parts from two of these
plates, two different parts of the machine were shown ; and by taking
two other pairs  doisfsesctteerdeo--typoene  plates, each of these separate  parts was
again shown as                               plate containing nothing but    the fram

ing supporting that part, and the other nothing but its moving parts.
The author suggested the employment of this method for colouring

   Professor Willis described his instrument called the Odontograph,
designed for enabling workmen to find at once the centres from which
the two portions of the tooth arc to be struck, so that the teeth may
work truly together. The position of these centres is pointed out by
theory, and this instrument may be considered as the practical means
of carrying out the theory *. He also described the construction and
use of some scales of measurement invented by Mr. Holtzapfel.

Mr. Sopwith described the improvements made by him in the con

leveling, the face of which is protected by a glass shield. It is hinged
so as to admit of being used in any seam of coal from 3 to 5 feet in

             metrical Projection.

   Mr. Sopwith exhibited several instruments, diagrams, &c, adapted
to facilitate the process of isometrical projection. The first of these is
a set of triangular rulers, the angles of which are coincident with the
angles in the isometrical projection of a cube ; and hence they can be
applied with great ease and rapidity to the delineation of geometrical
forms in isometrical drawings.
    Isometrical squares and circles engraved on drawing-paper are
adapted to facilitate this mode of projection. The circles are gradu
ated; and hence any angles, whether on a horizontal or vertical plane,
can be correctly delineated and subsequently measured. Mr. Sopwith
illustrated the advantages of this method of drawing by several exam
ples of its application to astronomy, to architecture, and to constructive
designs generally. One remarkable property of isometrical drawings
was pointed out, viz. that drawings made on a flat surface may have
other flat surfaces pasted on by an edge, and which will appear in true
projection when turned over upon the edge, and horizontal and vertical
movements may be thus shown in one drawing ; thus forming what may
be appropriately termed a picture model.
   The Isograph is an entirely new instrument, invented by Mr. Sop
with, for transferring plans from orthographical to isometrical projec
tion. This is effected by means of a simple mechanical movement.
The isograph consists of a number of parallel rulers, made of brass or
ivory, the fiducial edges of which are an inch distant. These rulers
are fixed at each end by pivots to two brass bars, the centre of each

pivot exactly coinciding with the line of each fiducial edge. A brass
gauge is used to fix this series of rulers so as to form a true geome

trical square ; and when in this position, the principal lines or points
are marked off upon the respective edges of the rulers. The instru
ment is then moved into a lozenge shape, and a gauge, equal in length
to one side of the square, is fitted so as to form the shorter diagonal.
Hence the opposite angles of the instrument are respectively 60° and
120°, which is the required condition of isometrical projection.

On an Improved Method of constructing large Tables or Writing- Ca-
  bi?iets, adapted to save much time, and to secure a systematic arrange
  mweitnht ,ofFa.Gg.Sre.at number and variety of Papers. By Thomas Sop-

In the arrangements of official business, in literary and professional
pursuits, and in conducting an extensive correspondence, great in
convenience and loss of time   result from the   want of   bmoxeetsh,od&cc,oenasceh
quent on papers being kept in  various drawers,
                                                 closets,

requiring a separate key. The principle on which the improved wri
ting-tables are constructed is intended to obviate this inconvenience.
   Drawings were exhibited, showing various modes of constructing
large writing-tables and cabinets in such a manner that, by means of a
                 whole   of the drawers, closets, &c, are  at once
single key, the  of the  partitions, drawers, &c, can be   reached                   opened,
and the whole                                                                         by any
person writing at the table, without stirring from the seat in front. The
whole, in like manner, is closed by a spring lock ; and the simplicity

and strength of the arrangements are such, that the movements are not
liable to be deranged. One of the drawings represented a writing-ca
binet in Mr. Sopwith's office, in the upper part of which there are one
hundred divisions for papers to be assorted, besides drawers for writing
and drawing materials, and small shelves for colours and mathematical
instruments. An upright door, hinged at the bottom, falls, when un

locked, upon a flat table, and forms a writing-desk ; and any papers
left upon it at the time of its being shut up, are of course ready to be re
sumed the moment it is opened again. This door is rebated on its three
edges, so as to overlap the adjoining doors ; and the shutting of this
door also forces in an iron bar, which fastens the drawers in the lower
part of the table by a very strong and simple mechanical movement.
   There is also an apparatus for hanging keys upon, so that when any

key is removed, a slip of wood, with the name of the key upon it, falls
down so as to prevent the door from being closed ; and the person
using the desk is therefore reminded of having forgotten to replace the
key. The facility of reference and arrangement admits of many short
periods of time being devoted to study or business which, but for such
an arrangement, would be totally lost

             Mining  Records. By

   The commercial prosperity of Great Britain mainly depends on its
mineral productions. Whatever tends to promote economy in the
working of mines, and to afford increased facilities for the discovery of
mineral treasures, eminently deserves the attention of every enlightened
statesman who regards the future as well as the present welfare of the
country.

    The great value of, and increasing necessity which exists for, a re
gular system of preserving mining records, has been repeatedly urged

by the most eminent and experienced geologists and miners. No such
system has yet been pursued in this country ; and the importance of
the subject renders it deserving of the attention of the British Associa
tion during its meeting in the midst of the mining districts of the north
of England.

   Mr. Sopwith's paper proceeds to point out the inconveniences and
serious loss of capital, and even of human life, resulting from the pre
servation of mining records being neglected, and to explain several
practical details connected with the subject.

          On Improvements in Ship Building. By Mr. Lang.

   Mr. Lang described and exhibited some models illustrative of the
safety keel, which had been introduced with great success ; and men
tioned instances in which vessels fitted with these keels had struck and
come off without sustaining material injury. He then entered into
some details respecting the proper construction of merchantmen, and
exhibited some models of the bottoms of merchantmen *. He also ex
hibited a method of securing a round-headed rudder, and a model of a
tube-scuttle to admit light between decks, and which had been used
with great success.

                 On an Improved Method of constructing Railways. By J. Price.

                        This method consists in fixing rails on a continuous stone base, a
                       groove having been made in the stone to receive a flange or projection
                    of the lower side of the rail. The stones and rails are to break joint
                      with each other, and the chair by which the rails are to be secured is
                    to be made fast to the rail by a bolt, not riveted, but slipped in. The
                    chair is to be sunk until the top is level with the top of the stone, and
                    fastened to it by two small wooden pins. Any sinking of the road is
                      to be obviated by driving wedges of wood underneath the stone until
                      it is raised to the required height. The chairs are to be fixed at about
                  four feet apart, and to weigh, if of malleable iron, 14 pounds ; but if
                    of cast iron, 20 pounds : the rail to weigh 50 pounds per yard.

               Machine for raising Water by an Hydraulic Belt. By Mr. Hall.

                       In this machine, an endless double woollen band, passing over a roller
                    at the surface of the earth, or at the level to which the water is to be
                      raised, and under a roller at the lower level, or in the water, is driven
                      with a velocity of not less than 1000 feet per minute. The water con
                    tained betwixt the two surfaces of the band is carried up on one side
                    and discharged at the top roller by the pressure of the band on the
                    roller, and by centrifugal force. This method has been in practice for
                  some time in raising water from a well 140 feet deep in Portman Mar
                    ket, and produces an effect equal to 75 per cent, of the power expend
                    ed, which is 15 per cent, above that of ordinary pumps. This method
                      would be exceedingly convenient in deep shafts, as the only limit is the
                   length of the band, and many different lifts may be provided.

                                On Cliff's Dry Gas Meter. By Mr. Samuda.
                       This instrument consists of a pulse glass, that is, two thin glass globes

                      united by a tube. These globes are partially filled with alcohol, and

                  hermetically sealed when all the air is expelled from their interior. In
                   this state, the application of a very slight degree of heat to one of the

                      globes will cause the alcohol to rise into the other. The pulse glass is
                     fixed on an axis, having a balance-weight projected from and the
                   axis works in bearings on the sides of chamber through which the
                     gas to be measured made to pass the gasometer in two currents, one
                   of which heated and the other cold. The hot gas made to enter

                   the cold gas blows upon the other. The difference of temperature thus
                     established between the globes causes the alcohol to rise into the upper
                     one, and the glass turns over on its axis, thus varying its position, and
                   bringing the full globe opposite to the hot stream of gas. This stream,

top globe, repeats the operation, and the speed at which the globes
oscillate will be precisely in proportion to the quantity of gas which
has been blown upon them, provided a uniform difference of tempera
ture is always maintained between the two streams of gas. The dif
ference of temperature is established and rendered uniform by a small
flame of gas, which heats a chamber through which the lower current
of gas has to pass, and the arrangements for securing an equality in
the difference of temperature are very ingenious. The instrument is
first tested by making a given quantity of gas pass through and ob
serving the number of oscillations of the pulse-glass. This once esta
blished, the instrument registers the quantity passed with extreme
accuracy.
                                                                     it,
   Sir John Robison mentioned a circumstance which he considered ofa;               a
peculiar importance to the lower orders. Mr. Strutt, of Derby, to:
whom the country owed so much, had some years ago expressed to him'
an opinion, that coal-gas would be found by the lower orders the
cheapest fuel for cooking. This he had applied and the whole appa
ratus, which might be considered as the converse of the Davy safety-
lamp, consisted in fixing piece of wire-gauze at the extremity of
gas-pipe of about six inches in diameter. He referred to the account
in Loudon's Encyclopsedia of Cottage Architecture,' for some valuable
remarks and directions on this subject. The wire-gauze was liable to
be destroyed under a long-continued intense heat this, however, was
obviated by sprinkling a small quantity of sand upon it. Bulk for
bulk, gas was more expensive than coal, but the former was more eco
nomical and convenient for occasional use and the smaller operations
in cooking.

   Sir John Robison explained a model of the bucket of pump in usea
in Sweden, the peculiar feature of which was, that the pressure of the
sides of the bucket outwards against the pipe exactly proportionalis
to the load to be raised. This bucket peculiarly applicable for rai
sing foul water.is

                         gine.

Professor Willis described the method recently introduced by Mr.
Hawthorn, for working the valves of a locomotive without the usual

eccentrics. The motion is derived at once from the connecting rod,
by means of a pin placed at the centre of the connecting rod, and giv
ing to a frame a reciprocating motion in a vertical direction at every
revolution of the crank. To this frame are attached arms, by which

motion is communicated to the slides. It is necessary that the slide
should be open for the admission of the steam into the cylinder, a
                                                                        which is techni
little  before  the piston has completed the stroke ; this,             with great care,
cally   termed   the lead of the slide, must be provided for
so as to correspond with the various speeds of the piston ; this arrange
ment cannot be made where eccentrics are used without considerable
difficulty ; but this is provided for in Mr. Hawthorn's method by sim
ply changing the angle at which the frame is set, an operation which

can be performed by adjusting a screw.

On the Application of Machinery to the Manufacture of Steam-Engine
Boilers, and ot/ter  VFesasierlsbaoifrnW.rought  Iron               or  Copper,  subject  to

Pressure. By Wm.

Having described the usual process of hand-riveting, and the im
perfections to which it is subject, the author adverts to the riveting
machine, which obviates these defects, and produces sound and perfect
work. As the time occupied in the process of hand-riveting, allowing

the rivet to cool, and thus destroying its ductility, is the chief cause of
all the defects, it is evident that an instrument having a force to com
press the rivet within an indefinitely short period must obviate or en
tirely remedy these evils. The commencement of the process is the
same in both methods. In a circular boiler, such as is represented at
a, in the annexed figure, the plates having been first bent to the circular
form, with all the requisite holes punched in them, two rings of plates
are put together by temporary bolts, and suspended over the machine,
by three chains, from blocks over the centre of the boiler. These blocks
are arranged to move backwards and forwards for circular boilers, to
suit any diameter, and are also made to move crossways for plain flat
l,work. Having now placed       the boiler so as to                          tchirecu"lahroldpeorr-

From this description it will appear evident that no time is lost ; that
no hammering of the rivet takes place after it is cooled, to render it
brittle : but the action is completed so rapidly, as to leave it in a per
fectly sound and ductile state. This is a point of the utmost import
ance, as the joint
contraction of the  is so   firmly united by   the subsequent   coofol"incgaualnkd

ing" almost unnecessary. Caulking is an operation universally adopted
to prevent leakage, by setting up the edge of the plates upon the seam
or joint with a hammer and a square-ended tool of cast steel.
By the use of the machine much time and labour is saved, by the
substitution of instantaneous compression instead of a long series of
impacts. It is applicable to all kinds of circular tubes and boilers, and
also to every description of flat and square work. It fixes and coni-

        On a Steam-engine Boiler. By J. Price.

   The author exhibited a model of a steam-engine boiler of 18 horse
power which is at work daily at the Durham Glass-works, Gateshead,
and described its peculiar construction and advantages in regard to

safety and cheapness.

   He states, that by the construction of the flues the whole of the

heat is rendered available. Owing to the draught, the dust that accu

mulates in the flues is only ten pounds per week.
   There are two cocks in the laggings of the furnace, and three along
the bottom of the boiler to let off water and sediment when required;

   A steam safety-valve is applied in the form of a ball in a cup which

rises from its seat and allows the steam to escape so soon as it comes to
within one pound of the safety pressure ; it is covered with a cap, which
is secured by nuts within the boiler, and cannot be removed or
weighted without cooling the boiler: consequently it is beyond the
reach of the working engineer, who has his own valve to regulate as he

likes.

                   Remarks on the Construction of Steam-Boilers. By W. Greener.
                       Mr. Greener stated his opinion, that the accidents which happen to

                    steam-boilers are principally due to defect in Ihe material of which
                      thev are constructed. He detailed several experiments made on slips
                    of iron cut from plates of different quality. He found that slips cut
                      latitudinally from a plate sustained less pressure by 30 per cent, than
                    slips of the same dimensions cut longitudinally ; in some cases the dif
                    ference was much greater. He also had immersed plates in a mixture
                    of sulphuric acid and water, and found that the injury done in twenty-
                    four hours varied from 6^ to 15 per cent, of the original strength.

       On Methods of Filtering Water. By J. T. Hawkins.

    In this paper the author detailed the various essentials for a durable
and simple filter for obtaining pure water. The charcoal must be per
fectly well burnt, and kept from exposure to the atmosphere. A test of
       is,

good charcoal that when pulverized, sinks rapidly in water. The
charcoal must be supported on an indestructible material, as a plate of
burnt clay perforated with holes. The filter may consist of a common
garden-pot, or similar vessel, with holes at the bottom the lower part
may be filled with round pebbles, then some smaller pebbles, then some
coarse sand, and finally stratum of pounded charcoal, of about three
or four inches in thickness. It
                                 great mistake to put any material,
as sand, above the charcoal, with the view of arresting the grosser par
ticles of impurity,  as the sand will quickly stop up,
                     thus prepared will render water    and be impervious
to water. A filter                                      perfectly clear and

On the  Water-workFs.Ro.Sf .N,etMcc.aIsmtlet.-oCn.-ETy.,neS.fC  By   Joseph  Glynn,

   In the month of April 1833, Mr. Glynn was requested, by a body of
gentlemen in Newcastle, to report to them the best means of supplying
the dense and increasing population of the town with water, the want
of which was daily becoming more urgent.

   A water company already in existence, incorporated by an act or
charter of ancient date, claimed a right to all the springs which had
been or might be discovered for the supply of the town. But as all the
higher portions of land have been perforated by coal works and quar

ries, and the town stands on a hill sloping rapidly to the Tyne, it was
obvious that from natural springs or from wells an adequate supply
could not be obtained. In a long course of years the shares of the
ancient company had fallen into the hands of a few persons not dis
posed to invest their money in new and extensive works; their pipes
were chiefly of wood, with a small portion of leaden pipes, none exceed
ing six inches in diameter, and all incapable of bearing much pressure.

It was therefore necessary to have recourse at once to the river Tyne.
Recent experiments on the largest scale had shown that the water of

rivers flowing past populous towns might be applied with advantage to
the purposes of domestic uses, after being rendered free from impurity

iby artificial filtration. For the lower or filtering station Mr. Glynn

fixed on a field at the river-side, near Elswick, 51 feet above low-
water mark, this elevation lessening the great height to which it was
requisite to force the filtered water. The upper reservoir, near the
Quarry House on the west turnpike road, being at its lowest part 237
feet above low-water mark, or about 1 86 feet above the level of the
works at Elswick. The bottom of this reservoir is level with the arches
of the crown on the tower of St. Nicholas church above the statues on

the corner pinnacles.
    As the town then contained a population, by the latest estimate,

amounting to 54,000, and about 3500 houses of 10/. and upwards of
annual value, the number of which was fast, increasing, it was recom
mended that the new works should be capable of supplying at least
4-00,000 gallons per day of filtered water, and that the upper reservoir
should contain not less than four days' water at that rate of consump
tion. As the flood-tide brings up a portion of salt water, it is neces
sary that the supply should be raised when the tide is down, and to
pump it in a short time. A steam-engine, having a cylinder 54 inches
in diameter, with a stroke of 8 feet, was therefore erected at the works
at Elswick, with three boilers, any two of which are capable of working

the engine.
                  TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                        165

The engine works two pumps of different sizes ; one of them raises
the daily supply from the river in three hours, and the other forces it
in eight hours to the upper reservoir, through a main pipe of 14 inches

diameter and 1700 yards in length.                         into " subsidiary
   The water when raised from the river is received
tanks" of brickwork set in Roman cement, of which there are two, each
of them containing a day's supply ; by this means it will take 24 hours
to settle and deposit the earthly particles suspended in it before it be
suffered to run upon the filtering apparatus, which is a large brick tank,
containing a series of beds or strata of sand and gravel, resting upon
brick tunnels set in Roman cement, the uppermost bed being of fine
sand, the lowest of pebbles. The area of the filter bed is 10,000 square
feet; the water filters by descent, and is received into the tunnels,
whence it is forced by the steam-engine through the main pipes a di
stance of 1700 yards, to a height of 200 feet to the high reservoir, and
is thence distributed in cast-iron pipes of various diameter over the
whole of the town. These works have been completely successful.
The ancient company have disposed of their charter and their wooden
pipes to the directors of the Subscription Water Company, who, during
the meeting at Newcastle, opened their works for the inspection of the
members of the British Association.

From this paper it appears, that of a population of 64,000, and of

16,000 children   whole, apparently receiving   15, there are  7761    or 48^

nominal, in schools. In a district of the town, every place of abode
in which was visited, and the number of children from 3 to 15 years of
age found to be contained 4352, it appears 44^ per cent were found
able to read and write : of 736 persons who registered births and
deaths in all the parishes, 513 could not write, or 41 per cent: of 1264

persons committed to prison, chiefly for grave offences, during 18 months,

only 30 could read and write well. A large proportion of the schools
for the poor were found totally inadequate for the purposes of real edu
cation, and the teachers often as ignorant as the scholars. That the inhabi

highway-robbery with violence, burglary, and shop-burglary, and 12
of these offences were by strangers. Of the rest of the offences, 325
were for assault, and 617 being drunk and disturbing the public peace,
and 283 lying insensibly drunk in the streets : so that nearly one-half
of the offences were for drunkenness.               The committals, to the popula

many accounts considered preferable to an arbitrary system of typo

In the course of his attention to the internal economy of institutions,
the author has found, that although it is very practicable to teach those
born blind to read, yet it is a truly difficult task to teach them to think
accurately. In every passage where a visible image is introduced to

A  Series of Statistical Illustrations  tohfethReepvr.inHc.ipLa.l  JUonnieves,rsiMtie.As .of  Great

   These illustrations consisted principally of tables, in which Mr. Jones
calculated the amount of income derived from the ancient endow
ments of the colleges, and from various other sources of revenue,
the degrees conferred in the Universities, and the number of members
qualified by their degrees to take a part in the government of the

Universities.

   At the present time, it appears that the total number of members in
each of the two great English Universities, of Oxford and Cambridge,
exceeds 5000, and that the number of resident members in each of these

Universities is about 1600.
   Mr. Jones states that the total annual expenditure of 1600 members

amounts to about 480,000/. per annum in Oxford, and about 400,000/.
per annum in Cambridge.

   It appears that the average annual number of fires during this period
was 4-95, the number of alarms from chimneys on fire 108, and the
number of false alarms 68.

   Of the total number of fires, nearly one third occasion serious damages,
and in 6 out of 100 instances the buildings were wholly consumed. In

13 instances, 2 buildings were destroyed by a single fire ; in 4 instances,
3 buildings ; in 6 instances, 4 ; in 2 instances, 5 ; and in 1 instance, 8.

   The number of fires is on the increase, but probably not out of pro
portion to the great increase of buildings.

   The number of fires accompanied by loss of human life was 41 ; the
number of lives lost was 51.

   It appears that although the greatest number of fires have occurred in

December, yet the number from May to October slightly exceeds that
from October to May.

   Private houses and the dwelling parts of other houses furnished
nearly one half of the whole number of fires. Next in frequency were
sale-shops or offices, victuallers, carpenters, bakers, oil- and colour-
men, stables, cabinet-makers, tinmen, booksellers, warehouses, hat-
makers, &c. The number of fires in the houses of lucifer match-makers

was considerable.

   The causes of fires have been discovered in four-fifths of the cases.
Of these causes accidents from candles form by far the largest class, or
3 in 10 cases; and of these 43 per cent, arose from the setting on fire of
bed-curtains ; 22 per cent, from the setting on fire of window-curtains,
and 35 per cent, from oth.er accidents. The next most frequent cause is
the defective construction or imperfect cleansing of flues, chimneys, and
stoves, amounting to 22 per cent, of the whole number. The number
of accidents from gas was 7-£ per cent., from fire-heat applied to various
                 TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                  171

processes 7 per cent., and from linen hung before the fire 8 per cent.
These are the principal causes. The number of wilful fires was small,
only 1 in 64 fires.

    As regards insurance, two-fifths of the houses were wholly uninsured;
one-third were insured for both building and contents ; 1 1 per cent,
were insured for the building only, and 17 per cent, for the contents

only.
    During the five years under review only 5 large fires have occurred

at which property to the extent of more than 20,000/. has been de
stroyed. These were the Houses of Parliament, in October, 1834; a
fire in Silver-street, Golden-square, in March 1835; that at the Western
Exchange, in March 1836; that at Fenning's Wharf, in August of the
same year; the fire at Davies' Wharf, in December 1837. The only
large fire this year was at the Royal Exchange, on the 10th of January.

Abstract  ofllie  Report of the Railway Commissioners  in Ireland.
                           By W. R. Rawson.

The Commissioners of Railways for Ireland have founded their re
commendations upon the distribution and employment of the population,
the commerce, traffic, and number of passengers in the various districts,
the facilities which the geological features of the country present, and
the comparative power of the several districts to avail themselves of

railway communication.

   It appears that the population is most dense in the northern counties;
next in order are the midland counties, east of the Shannon ; and then
the southern counties of Tipperary, Limerick, and parts of Cork and
Waterford. The population in the north is in the best condition, then
that in the south ; the midland districts nearly resemble the southern,
but the western is far inferior to either.
The order of the principal towns as regards the amount of their
traffic, is as follows : Dublin, Cork, Belfast, Limerick, Waterford,
Galway, &c. Their order as regards the value of imports and exports
is the following: Belfast, Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Londonderry,
Newry, Limerick, &c. The returns of the amount of passengers,
traffic, of postage collected, and of banks, confirm the preponderance
of Dublin, Cork, Belfast, Limerick, and Waterford. The efforts there
fore of the commissioners have been directed to lay down lines of rail
way between these towns. The geological features of the country offer
peculiar facilities for effecting this object, the principal part of the pro
posed lines being carried through a country of carboniferous limestone,
the most level and easy formation for such works.
The commissioners propose two main lines, one to the south from
Dublin to Cork, throwing off branches to Kilkenny and Limerick, the

expense of which they estimate at 2,329,000/., and the annual profit
at 3£ per cent,  upon that sum.     Connected with this line
from Limerick    to Waterford, the  cost of which is estimated  is a branch
                                                                at 400,000/.,

and the annual dividend at 3f per cent.
172 EIGHTH REPORT -- 1838.

The proposed lines in the north are, from Dublin to Cavan, and
thence two branches, one to Armagh, to join the line already com
Ifmenced to Belfast, and the other in a north westerly direction to Ennis-
killen. The cost of these two lines is estimated at 2,015,000/.            this
line, which will be more expensive than the south, cost 11,000/. a mile,

the annual return    will be 4£ per cent.               to enter more      fully into
                     upon the present occasion

belong to probably 40 others. These houses are good and substantial

show the excellent influence and effects of wise and economic principles
and management upon the happiness of the workpeople and the com

A Short Account of the Barton CoUeries' Club. By T. Wilson, F.S.S.

    The Society  thus designated must be considered purely as an            expe
riment -- as an  attempt to ascertain, in certain                           what
terms a miner    might insure to himself and his    circumstances,     on"
                                                                            relief

during any illness that might arise from any accident happening to
them while at work."

The Club was established in February 1833 at Silkstone Colliery,
near Barnsley, and has since been adopted at the Darton Colleries. The
subscriptions are deducted from the wages of the men, the allowances
have been paid and the accounts kept by the owner of the mine, and
the meetings have been held at the Colliery ; so that all expenses have

been avoided, and the funds may be considered as wholly applicable to
the purposes of relief.

   A member whose wages are less than 7*. a week, pays 6d. on entrance,
and one halfpenny per week, and receives when ill 3*. 6d. a week so
long as the illness continues ; all whose wages exceed 7*., pay 1*. on
entrance, and one penny per week, and receive when ill 7*. a week.

   The data from which the reports of the French Mining Engineers
are drawn are collected under the authority of a law passed by the Le
gislative Chambers in 1833; and Mr. Porter draws attention to the
fact, that the productiveness of mining industry in France has increased
in a greatly accelerated ratio since that time as compared with previous
                                                                                in part at least, attribu

out the desirableness of adopting some system for the collection of
similar data in this country. The value of the coal, iron, lead, anti

France, has been increased from 4,230,000/. in 1832 to 6,170,000/. in

quantity was raised in 1825. In 1832, before the plan of inspection

 On an Outline for Subjects for Statistical Inquiries. By Mr. Hare,
                   President of the Leeds Statistical Society.

    The author observed how much the importance and value of statistical
societies would be augmented by a strict attention, so far as is practi
cable, to uniformity in the designs they have in view, by a general agree
ment in reference to the principles on which they are based, the terms
and numerals employed in their investigations, and the documents ne
cessary to their elucidation.

   With a view to the attainment of these desirable objects, Mr. Hare
has sketched an outline of the subjects of inquiry, comprising a series
of tables, intended to be filled up by different societies.

   From such tables, of which there are upwards of 120, each town
where a society is established may have the number and description of
papers which its peculiar locality may require.

Criminal Returns of the Empire. By Jeffries Kings ley.

The author presented, in this communication, a summary of criminal
returns according to the system of fiscal and criminal statistics as pro
             himself in the Standard County    Book for the treasurers
pounded by   The subjects were arranged under
of Ireland.                                    the following heads :--
Statistical references. Population census, 1831. Number of souls to
the square mile, English. Comparative standard : Carlow, least popu
lous county, rated as one crime. Counties in the order of population.
Offences against the person. Offences against property with violence.

Offences against property without violence. Offences (malicious)
against property. Offences and forgery against the currency. Offences
not included in the foregoing. Total of all offences. Deaths. Free
pardon. Executed. Petty Sessions' courts. General Sessions' courts.
Assize courts.

The return to these several heads was collected from the Prison

Reports, Ireland, for 1836 ; but, seeking to establish a principle, the
author did not hold himself responsible for the accuracy of the parti
culars which were stated in the return.

    EXHIBITION OF MODELS, PHILOSOPHICAL INSTRUMENTS, AND PRODUCTS
                                           OF NATIONAL INDUSTRY.

    It is a subject of regret to many that the facilities afforded by the

Meetings of the British Association for the Exhibitions of Models, &c.
have not hitherto been generally known or properly appreciated. The
general Committee of the Association appointed for this purpose, in
conjunction with the Local Committee in Newcastle, beg leave, there
fore, to call your attention to the opportunity afforded by the meeting
together of the most eminent men of science, from all paits of the
kingdom, for making known the merits of inventions, the excellence of
instruments, and the value of the products of industry in general, and
to invite you to avail yourself of this opportunity.

    Philosophical instruments --models of inventions, of improvements in
machinery, of new applications of the mechanical powers, of workings
in mines, &c.--products of national industry, new, rare, remarkable in

any respect, or exhibiting the progress of any department of the arts, or
of the application of scientific principles to  their improvement -- illus
trations of the rise of new arts from new       discoveries in science--re

markable natural and artificial productions, especially such as are likely

to be of use in the arts -- interesting geological sections, &c, are amsng

the objects it is desirable to exhibit. An accurate description, pointing

                                                   if,

              PLAN OF THE EXHIBITION.;
                a
        THE EXHIBITION WILL CONSIST OF TWO PARTS.

       -- Specimen.* connected with the Arts and the Dcvelopcmcnl of

                                         National Industry.

A. Local. -- Articles manufactured in the district, showing the nature
        of the products of local industry -- the present state of the manu
        factures -- Specimens illustrating the improvement or progress

         of the several branches.

B. General. -- Products of industry from all parts of the kingdom --

         Specimens illustrating the different steps from the raw material
         to the finished article.
     Raw materials of less common kind, which are or may be applied
        to useful purposes in the arts -- which are used or abundantly pro
          duced, or may be so, either at home or abroad, and are susceptible
          of beneficial application to industrial purposes.

                  II.--Mechanical and Philosophical.

A.-- Models of Machines, or parts of Machines -- 'old, new, or im

          proved or illustrating the gradual progress of invention.
      Models of workings in mines.
B. -- Philosophical instruments --new, nicely adjusted, or for the pur

         pose of comparison.

C. -- Remarkable Minerals --interesting Geological Sections-- Fossils --
        rare or curious Specimens in any of the branches of Natural

          History.

     N.B. The Exhibition will be open to all Members of the Associ
ation and their families, and to all other persons who may have trans

mitted any article considered worthy of a place in the collection.

     Mr. Grainger, to whose liberality the Association is in other re
spects so much indebted, having placed an elegant and spacious room
at the disposal of the local Committee for the purposes of the Exhibi
tion ; the objects of interest contained in the following catalogue were
arranged in it, and access given to the members of the Association on
 Tuesday the 21st of August.

      In future, it would be very desirable to insist on the models, &c.
 being sent in at least one week before the day of meeting of the As
 sociation, that the Exhibition may be opened before the arrival of the
 strangers. The aid of wood cuts or other illustrations should also be
 employed in order that the list of articles contained in the Exhibition
 may be made as much of a catalogue raisonnee as possible. The delays
 and inconveniences attending the reception and arrangement of the
 specimens in the present Exhibition have prevented the catalogue from
 appearing so soon, or in so complete a form, as on future occasions may

  reasonably be expected.

 PHILOSOPHICAL INSTRUMENTS, &c

             MECHANICAL INVENTIONS.

     1. The Pendulous Printing Press. --By Thomas Edmonson,
Milton Station. --This instrument has been invented for the pur
pose of dating the tickets given to passengers on the Newcastle
and Carlisle Railway with facility and despatch. Upwards of
ten thousand tickets can be printed by it with one supply of ink.
This is accomplished by means of a ribbon saturated with a pecu
liar inking composition, attached to two small rollers, and shift
ed by the pressure of the finger against the instrument. The

impression, which is dry and permanent, is obtained by simply
putting the ticket into a space left for it in the centre of the press.

    2. Model of a Chair and Rail, with Guard, to prevent Car
riages running off Railways, with drawings of a steam boiler, &c.
By Ralph Rewcastle.

from the syphon. An intermitting fountain is formed by closing

the tube T of the cup, (which when filled with water forms the
valve at the foot of the syphon.) Upon opening T, the water

flows without intermission.

scending scale upon the staff,are fixed at one height (5 feet) above

the ground, and the difference of level of the respective sites of

the staff and stand is at once ascertained from one or the other

scale, upon directing the telescope (when adjusted) to the staff.

   5. Safety Coal Gin.-- J. G. Wright, Wakefield.

    6. Specimens illustrating the Process of manufacturing
Needles by Patent Machinery. --Invented by Mr. Samuel

Cocker, Porter Works, Sheffield.

No. 1.-- Soft steel wire in lengths for 2 needles.
      2. -- Do. pointed on conical files, making 10,000 revolutions per

          minute.

3. -- Do. grooved with an indentation for the eye.
4. -- Do. do. and eyed.
5. -- Do. filed, headed, and eyed, by punching.
6. --Do. filed, headed, drilled, and countersunk.

7.--Needles made according to the old mode.
8.-- Finished needles (sharps) made by patent machinery.

9. --Do.           (betweens)                    do.

The value of labour from the wire No. 1 to No. 7 (inclusive) would

be Is. Id. per thousand. The expence by patent machinery from No.

1 to No. 5 or 6, inclusive, Id. per thousand.

     100 patent machines, which would occupy four rooms, each about
25 yards by 10, will, by the power of a six horse steam engine, be suf

ficient to produce 14,000,000 needles per week.

The fush, made in grooving, is filed off" by circular cutters, in the last

operation of the machine, leaving the needle in the state of No. 5 or 6.

      7.  A Specimen of Flooring Deals with Hoop Iron
          Holmes, Newcastle. --The advantages of which
Wm.
ness in the floor, more security against depredation, the iron

presenting an additional obstruction to the floor being sawn
through, and the preservation of the strength of the deals in a

greater degree than by the ordinary wood sliffers.

    8. Sling Fracture Bed. --By T. M. Greenhow, Esq. New
castle. The sling fracture bed consists of two parts. 1. The
first part is of the nature of a splint to which the injured limb
is fixed ; and the several portions of which admit of extension
by means of screws to accommodate them to the case under
treatment. 2. The second part is a support by means of which
the former part of the instrument is slung in an easy position.
The mode of application will be easily understood on inspection
of the instrument. The advantages of this plan of treatment
arc case and security to the patient, the power of moving to a
certain degree without hazard of displacement, and facility of
dressing wounds in cases of compound fractures.

    9. Splint for Fractures of the Lower Extremities. --By J.

Baird, Newcastle.
     10. A Cultivator. -- By Anthony Hall, Prudhoe. -- Model

one-fourth the working size. With this instrument a man can
dig one-fifth of an acre per day.

     11. Improved Colliery Bow and Hook, for the prevention of

accidents, in coal mines, occasioned by corves (in which the coals
are brought up from the pit) falling from the hooks affixed at
the end of the rope or chain. The improvement of the Bow con
sists in the under surface of it being lozenge shaped, so that not

having a flat surface, as is usually the case, the bow cannot rest
on the point of the hook, and must either slip into the bend of
the hook at once, or fall off altogether, in either of which cases

no accident can happen.

     12. Union Joint for Fire Engine Pipes. --By John Gardner,
Gun-maker, Newcastle-upon-Tyne. -- When the joint is put to

gether the bolt is pressed with the thumb, and the self-acting

spring prevents the bolt from shifting by any action whatever,

and when the joint is to be taken asunder the bolt head is pressed

with the finger and thumb and drawn at the same time, and then
                                                       10

giving the joint a quarter turn it will come asunder. The put
ting together and taking asunder will not take more than a very
few seconds. It is perfectly tight to air and steam.

    18. Model of a new method of Working the Valves of a Loco
motive Engine, by R. and W. Hawthorn, Newcastle-upon-Tyne.

                                              BOILER.

A Centre of Slide Rod.  B. -- Centre of Cylinder.

     The slider a is attached by a pin to the centre of the con
necting rod, working in the frame b b, which gives to the frame

a reciprocating motion vertically from the connecting rod at
every revolution of the cranked axle. The upper arm of the
frame b b is conected with the arm d, fixed on the same weigh-
bar as the double arm c, by which the motion is communicated
to the slide valve by the change rod e. g is the reversing weigh-

bar, having three arms, hi n fixed upon it. The arm h is moved

by the rod k, communicating with the reversing handle or lever
worked by the engineman. I is connected to the change rod e,
by the bar m, which by moving the reversing handle or lever
can be changed from one of those pins to the other at the ends
of the double arm c, and the engine made to go in either di

rection required.
     The arm n has a box with a set screw for adjusting its

length, by which any angle in a few minutes can be given to the
frame h b, which is a very important part in this arrange-
                                                      11

nient ; as the readiness and simplicity with which the lead can
be given to the slide valves, to correspond with the various speeds
and loads the engine may be put to, is a desideratum which
could not be obtained by eccentrics, without much labour and

time in loosening and resetting the eccentric wheels.

By this Telagraph, either spelling as in short hand or a vocabu

lary as in the common Telegraph may be employed ; and by
attaching to it a powerful lamp, it may be rendered as service
able by night as by day. The introduction of spelling will
permit communications to be interchanged in regard to all sub

   instrument by which he may ascertain the time for rating his
   clocks with far greater accuracy than by the ordinary means of

   the sun-dial and meridian line-- the instrument may be con
   structed at a verv trifling cost and made to serve the purposes of

   a level also.

       40. Eye Piece with Cavallo's Pearl Micrometer. --By the Rev.
   N. S. Heineken. This is intended to obviate the objections to

   the application of this simple micrometer to the reflecting

                              is to be about half full of quicksilver to support

                              the spirit in the long tube; upon the quicksilver at

                              G is a float supporting the wire C, which wire lias a

                              knee or bend in it with a small eye, which runs upon

                              the fixed wire D, carrying an index or pointer ; E is

                              the scale which must be made experimentally. The
                              Ifaction of the instrument is obvious.
                                                                      any change

                              takes place in the bulk of the spirit the quicksilver

   is also affected, and with the silver the ivory float G carrying

   the index or pointer, which shews at once the degree of tempera

   ture upon the scale ; this is the simple action of the thermo

   meter. To make it register, the two light indexes or pointers F

   move upon the wire D, their own friction keeping them where-

   ever they are placed. To set it the pointer F below the thermo
   meter's index must be pushed close up to it, and the pointer F

   above, pushed down it ; and it is evident that if any change of

   temperature takes place the thermometer's index will move the

   registering index either above or below, and leave it there,

   thereby shewing the extreme rise and fall of the thermometer in

   any given time. The action of the air upon the quicksilver is

   also provided against.

     42. An improved Marine and Mountain Barometer. --By
Sir David Milne.

     The construction of this instrument allows it to be used as a Marine
Barometer. In the middle of the tube, or half way down, the bore is

reduced to the size of an ordinary thermometer bore, in consequence of

which the mercury is prevented from flowing rapidly and violently into
the upper part of the tube, when the instrument swings about. The

open end of the tube through which the atmosphere acts on the mer

cury, is so constructed, that the mercury does not ran out or escape
when the instrument is upset.

     50. HaWs Patent Hydraulic Belt for raising Water.
     A woollen belt is passed over a roller at the top of the shaft and under

one at the bottom, and by giving the belt a velocity of about 1000 feet

per minute, the water adheres to the belt, and is brought up and dis
charged into a trough by the centrifugal force in passing over the top

roller. It possesses most important advantages over the pump, and is

particularly applicable to coal pits, mines, &c. &c.

v       54. Model of Lindleys Patent Bellows, working in an up
   right frame, by means of a rack staff, axle, rod, SfC.

       It consists of four boards, the second and fourth arc fixed and kept a

   certain distance from each other (according to the length of the stroke
   required) by means nf pieces of iron, the upper board rises and falls, the
                                                       17

third plays between the second and fourth (or bottom board). Between
the boards are frames of wood to support the leather. Three" of the boards
are so furnished with valves and other apparatus that the machine, when
covered with leather and fitted up, works like a double acting steam
cylinder, the space between the two upper boards forming the common
chamber, whence the air is conveyed through the pipe to the fire.
Upon the third board going down the air will rush in and fill the space
between the second and third boards ; upon the same board going up
the air will rush in and fill the space between the third and fourth
boards ; when the rack staff is pulled down the air is forced from be
tween the second and third boards into the chamber between the first

and second boards ; when the staff returns the air is driven from be
tween the third and fourth boards into the same chamber ; thus, when

the staff rises 01 falls the air is forced into the common chamber, by

which means a middle pipe is supported, and a constant and steady, as
well as powerful blast is obtained, capable of fusing a bar of iron when
one end of it is made red hot.

ARCHITECTURE, BRIDGES, &c.

     90. Timber Bridge -- 200 feet span, which is the largest span
in timber that has been attempted in this country. -- Each curved
under bearer forms an abutment for each pair of struts which

support the upper bearers, both the upper and under bearers

are so connected together by the struts and suspending pieces,

that the framing forms a solid rib, upon which the joists for

supporting the roadway are sustained, and the whole weight

of the bridge itself and the weights passing along
                                is                     ultimately
                                                  it,
rest upon the abutments. This bridge intended for turnpike-

road traffic, but the principle may be applied to any other kind

of traffic, such as railway traffic, with heavy locomotive engines
passing at rapid rates. A bridge of two arches, each similar to

the above,  is   now about to be erected over the Tweed at

Norham. --J. Blackmore, Esq. engineer, Newcastle.of
   91. Model of Piers for a Suspension Bridge. By J. Green,

Tyne above Scotswood. This arch on the same principle as

the immense viaducts now in progress on the Newcastle and

North Shields Railway.
     95. Model of a Timber Arch, on a new construction. By

Messrs. Green, Architects. -- In this arch the ribs are put together
with Dantzic deals, in lengths of from 21 feet to 45 feet, 11

inches broad, and 3$ inches thick, fixed together with oak tree
nails. The experiments tried have sufficiently proved the strength
                                                      22

of such arches, and the durability they possess over other
wooden bridges arises from the simplicity of their construction.

            The model is on a scale of half an inch to the foot.

   A viaduct of 5 arches on this principle is in progress of con
struction over Ouseburn, and another at Willington Dean, of

7 arches, the span of these arches being from 116 to 118 feet,

and the height of the bridges from 82 to 108 feet. The plans

undertaking
desirous of making them not merely a vehicle for original communi
cations pertaining to the entire subject of Natural History, but a
means of enabling their readers to keep pace with the progress of
the science in every stage of its advancement.
Memoirs on Descriptive Zoology ; Monographs ; characters of
                                      of the habits, instinctive faculties,
new  Genera and    Species;  notices   already known, -- as also Zooto-
and  geographical  range of  animals

mical communications, in so far as they serve to correct or confirm
the systematical station of species or entire groups, will occupy
a due share of this Journal.
With regard to the Vegetable Kingdom, besides the space which
will be devoted to Monographs and to Descriptive Botany, atten
tion will also be given to Vegetable Physiology and Phytotomy.
To all Naturalists, even to those who do not make Botany their
peculiar study, these subjects must be interesting, and indeed in
dispensable for the acquirement of a general proficiency in Natural
History. A portion of our pages, therefore, will be especially de
voted to them, as well as to all that pertains to the accurate charac
ters of Families, their geographical range, their uses in the arts,
and in medicine.
The investigation of Fossil Organic Remains stands in such in
timate connection with Zoology and Botany, that the claim of this
subject to a place in this Journal can hardly be questioned. Due
attention will therefore be given to those departments of descriptive
Geology that come within the province of Natural Hijtory.
Biographical sketches of illustrious Naturalists, and those who
have travelled for the sake of advancing science, will be occasion
ally introduced ; and the Editors also hope to be enabled to furnish
the reader with matter of popular and general interest supplied
by the correspondence of Naturalists who are engaged in voyages
of discovery.
Reviews of new works, and Notices of the most important British
and Foreign Publications connected with any of these subjects, will
be regularly brought before our readers.
From the Foreign sources of intelligence, which in Natural Hi-

                                           ASSOCIATE OF THE LINN.EAN SOCIETY.

   As it is the object of this Report to give the substance of all the important
Works and Memoirs on this interesting branch of Botanical Science, many of
which, especially those of Germany, are little if at all known in this country,
it has been thought that a translation of it will be acceptable to British Na

turalists.
