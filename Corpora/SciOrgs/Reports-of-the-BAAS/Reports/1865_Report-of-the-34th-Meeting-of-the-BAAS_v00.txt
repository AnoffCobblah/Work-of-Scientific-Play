REPORT OF THE KEW COMMITTEE.  XXXI

    Report of the Council of the British Association, presented to the
            General Committee, Wednesday, September 14, 1864.

   1. The Council have receiyed the Eeport of the Kew Committee for the

past year, which will be laid before the General Committee on Monday.
   2. The Report of the Parliamentary Committee has been received, and the

CouncU recommend the adoption of this Eeport by the General Committee.
   3. The Council have added to the list of Corresponding Members the names

of the following Poreign Men of Science, who have been present at Meetings

of the Association :

   Dr. Torell, Dr. Buys Ballot, M. Des Cloizeaux, and Prof. Adolph Steen.
   4. The CouncU have received invitations to hold the next Meeting of the

Association at Birmingham, and another to hold it at Nottingham. An in-

vitation has also been received from Dundee for the year 1867.

     Report of the Keiv Committee of the British Association for' the
                      Advancement of Science for 1863-1864.

  The Committee of the Kew Observatory submit to the Association the fol-

lowing statement of their proceedings during the past year :

  A set of SeK-recording Magnetographs, of the same pattern as those at

Kew, have been ordered by the Italian Government for Professor Donati
of Florence ; these have been completed by Adie of London, and despatched

to their destination.

   General Sabine has received letters from Mr. Meldrum, Director of the
Mauritius Observatory, and from Mr. EUery, Director of that at Melbourne,
from which there seems to be a good prospect that at no distant date Self-

recording Magnetographs may be in operation in these locahties. This

would be a result of very great scientific importance, since there are as yet
none of these instruments established in the southern hemisphere.

   The Committee have lost with regret the valuable services of Mr. Cham-
bers, who left the Observatory about the middle of November last for an

appointment in India. His place as Magnetical Assistant has been supplied

by Mr. George Whipple, who has given vaxxch. satisfaction in his new office.
   The sum of =£.50 has been received from the Government Grant Pund of

the Royal Society for the purpose of obtaining printed copies of magnetic
curves. This has been spent in procuring photolithographic copies of a

number of the most interesting traces simultaneously produced by the Mag-

netographs at Kew and Lisbon. These have been published by the Kew and
Lisbon Observatories, and distributed to scientific men likely to take an in-

terest in the subject.

   A Unifilar and Dip Cii'cle have been verified at Kew and forwarded to the

Lisbon Observatory, and a Self-recording Electrometer, on Professor W.

Thomson's principle, has also been despatched to that institution.

   Two Unifilars and two Dip Circles have likewise been ordered by Colonel

"Walker, Director of the Trigonometrical Sui'vey of India, and they are at

present in the hands of the opticians.
    The usual monthly absolute determinations of the magnetic elements

continue to be made at Kew, and the Self-recording Magnetographs are in
constant operation as heretofore, under the superintendence of Mr. Whipple,

Magnetical Assistant.
    Advantage has again been, taken of these automatic records of the earth's

magnetism by the Committee engaged in tlie preparation of electrical stand-

ards, who have found it desirable, for some of their experiments, to ascer-

tain the contemporaneous readings of the Declination Magnetograph.

   The following papers ha\iug reference to Kew Observatory have been

communicated to the Eoyal Society by Major- General Sabine, President of

that body :

1. Results of hourly Observations of the Magnetic Declination made by

Sir Francis Leopold M'^Clintock, li.N., and the Officers of the Yacht ' Fox,'

at Port Kennedy in the Arctic Sea, in the Winter of 1858-59 ; and a Com-

parison of these Results with those obtained by Captain Maguire, R.N. and

the Officers of H.M.S. ' Plover,' in 1852, 1853, and 1854, at Point Barrow.

A2. Comparison of the most notable Disturbances of the Magnetic Declina-

tion  in  1858 and 1859 at  Kew  and  Ncrtschinsk                                                     preceded by a brief Retro-
                                                                                                   ;

spective View of the Progress of the Investigation into the Laws and Causes

of the Magnetic Disturbances.

  A Table of the Mean Declination of the Magnet in each Decade from

January 1858 to December 1863, derived from the Observations made at
the Magnetic Observatory at Lisbon, has been dra-wn up by Senhor da Sil-

veira. Director of that Observatory.

   This Table exhibits the semiannual inequality to which that element is

subject at Lisbon, and which is of the same nature as that derived from the

Kew photographs by General Sabine.
   Mr. Stewart, Superintendent of the Kew Observatory, in conjunction

with Senhor CapeUo of the Lisbon Observatory, has communicated to the
Royal Societj' a paper, entitled " Results of a Comparison of certain Traces

produced simultaneously by the Self-recording Magnctographs at Kew and at

Lisbon, especially of those which record the Magnetic Disturbance of July 15,

1863."

   Mr. Stewart has likewise communicated to the same Society two short

papers, one " On the Sudden Squalls of 30th October and 21st ]S"ovember
1863," and another, entitled " Remarks on Sun-Spots." He has also com-

municated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh a paper on " Sun-Spots, and

their Connexion with Planetary Configurations."

Mr. A. H. Burgess, M.A., being desirous to obtain magnetical instruction,

is at present visiting the Observatory for the purpose of acquainting himself

with our method of observation.

   The Meteorological work of the Observatory is now performed by Mr.
Thomas Baker, who likewise takes charge of the photographic department

connected with the self-recording instruments, and executes botli offices very

satisfactorily.

                 During the past year 97 Barometers
                      ,, ,, ,, 389 Thermometers

have been verified, and five Standard Thermometers have been supplied to

Amen of science and opticians.        set of weights, a standai'd scale, and a

measure of capacity have likewise been verified. The Self-recording Baro-

graph continues in constant operation. Through an ingenious suggestion of

Mr. Beckley traces in duplicate have been obtained, and one of these has been

regularly forwarded to Admiral FitzRoy.

   The Self-recording Electrometer of Professor W. Thomson has continued in
constant operation until the beginning of August, when it was sent to the

optician for repairs.

The arrangements at the Observatory for testing Sextants remain as before.
                    REPORT OF THE KEW COMMITTEE.        XXXIU

During the past year eight Sextants, two Quadrants, and one Transit-

instrument have been verified.

The sun-spots continue to be observed, after the method of Hofrath

Schwabe, of Dessau.

  The Kew Heliograph in charge of Mi-. De la Rue has been continuously

worked by a qualified assistant, under the immediate supervision of Mr.

Beckley, who has proved of mucli service to the Committee in this as well as

in other matters. During the past year 175 negatives have been taken, and

four sets of positives have beeu printed from each, one of which has been

presented to the Eoyal Society. The negatives are being reduced under the
superintendence of Mr. De la Eue, and by means of an instrument of his

construction. Mr. B. Loe^v}% formerly assistant in the Flagstaff Observatory,

Melbourne, has been engaged in this reduction, which he is executing very
satisfactorily at Kew.

Mr. De la Eue is also having an arrangement made, by means of which

the proportion of the sun's disk obscured by spots may be conveniently

measured.

   At Mr. De la Rue's request Mr. Loewy is now examining all pictm-es
preserved at Kew, with reference to distribution of faculae and general ap-

pearance, and it seems that, out of more than 500 groups hitherto examined,

about 250 show a nearly equal distribution of faculous matter round the

penumbra, while of the rest more than 200 have the faculoe decidedly,

cither entirely or mostly, on the left side. After concluding the examination,

which will extend over more than 1000 spots, Mr. Loewy will submit the
result to Mr. De la Rue.

The Spectroscope belonging to the Chairman has been supplemented with

a set of eleven sulphuret-of-carbon prisms, made by Mr. Browning, and

giving the very great angular separation of more than 3' between the two

lines D. The Chairman has communicated a short description of these prisms,

and of the appearance of the two lines obtained by this arrangement, to the

Royal Society.

  That portion of the spectrum between D and E is now being mapped,

and all the measurements have already been made. The results obtained

show that the position of any line can be determined with very great accu-

racy. Mr. Loewy has been the principal observer, and he seems well quali-

fied for the work.

Preliminaiy arrangements have been made, under the superintendence of

Professor Stokes, for experiments on the retardation of the pendulum in

different gases.

At the request of the Secretary of State for India, received tkrough the

Royal Society, arrangements have been made for the preparation of appa-

ratus to be used for the vibration of i^endulums in vacuo at the different

stations of the Trigonometrical Survey in India ; and the request has also

been made that the officer who may conduct this experimental investigation

should receive instructions at this Observatory.

The instrument constructed by Mr. Broun for the purpose of estimating the

magnetic dip by means of soft iron remains at present at the Observatory.
   The balance of the ^40 granted by the British Association in 1861, for an

additional photographic assistant, has been expended under the superin-

tendence of Mr. De la Rue, along with fiu'ther sums which have been defrayed

by Royal Society grants received by that gentleman.

The Superintendent has likewise received grants from the Royal Society

for special experiments to be made at Kew, and when these are completed

1S64.                                                c

an account will be rendered to that Society. It wiU thus be seen that other

experiments and observations of a nature to further science are made at Kew

besides those which form the constant work of the Observatory, and of these

the Spectroscope measurements at present in progress may be mentioned as

an example ; it will also be noticed that the British Association do not bear

the expense of these experiments, but this is defrayed by those who bring them

before the Committee.

   Prom the financial statement which accompanies this Eeport, it will be

seen that the adverse balance of last year ha.s been considerably reduced,
but there is stiU a balance against this Observatory amounting to £4-5 17s. 9d.

The Committee recommend that a sum of JGOO should be granted for the

expenditure of the current year.

  A correspondence, which is appended to this Report, has taken place be-

tween the Astronomer Royal and the Chairman, relative to a paragraph con-
tained in the Report of the former to the Visitors of the Royal Observato7y,

    The Astronomer Royal has further suggested that certain experiments
should be made in this Observatory :

    1st. Eor the purpose of investigating the discordances which he has found

in his observations of the dipping-needle.

    2nd. For the purpose of investigating the displacements which occur in the

trace of his vertical -force photograph.

   3rd. On the temperature corrections of the force of a magnet made by

heating it in hot air instead of by hot water.
    The Committee, for the reasons contained in the letter of the Superinten-

dent (No. VII. Correspondence), considerd that it was not advisable to imder-
take the experiments suggested by the Astronomer Royal, as one of these

would necessarily involve the displacement of the Kew vertical-force magneto-

graph, while the others refer to points which, in the opinion of the Committee,

have been already decided by previous observations and experiments.

 --Mt dear Sib, The attention of the Kew Committee has been drawn to

the following paragraph in your Report to the Visitors of the Royal Ob-

servatory :

    " I consider it certain that the small probable errors which have been

attributed to ordinary needles are a pure delusion. I know no instrumental

determination in which, without any breach of faith, the wish for uniformity
of results wiU be so certainly followed by uniformity of results as in the
determination of dip."

   It having been suggested that the preceding paragraph may possibly be
considered to refer to other observations than those made at Greenwich, I
am requested by the Committee to inquire whether it is intended in any
measure to refer to dip-observations made at this Observatory, and published

in the publications of the Royal Society ; the object of the Committee being

                                                   Eoyal Observatory, Greenwich, S.E., 28tli June, 1864.

 --Mr DEAR SiE, I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 27th

inst., in which you state that the attention of the Kew Committee has been

drawn to a paragraph in my Eeport to the Visitors of the Royal Observatory,
wherein I express my opinion on the inaccuracy of the small probable errors

which have been attributed to ordinary dipping-needles ; and in which you

fm-ther remai'k that the cited paragraph may be considered to refer to other

observations than those made at Greenwich, and therefore, on the part of

the Xew Observatory Committee, you inquire whether the paragraph in

question is intended in any measure to refer to dip-observations made at the

Kew Observatory, and published in the publications of the Eoyal Society

the object of the Committee being that, in the interest of Magnetical Science,

the precise value of dip-observations made in the Kew Observatory should

be definitely ascertained.

It gives me great pleasure to enter fully upon any matter to which you may

myinvite  attention, and particularly so when the object is such as is charac-

terized in the last paragraph of yoiir letter.

The inquiiies in your letter are in fact two ;

First. Whether the paragraph of my Report refers to other observations

than those made at Greenwich ?
   To this I reply that it necessaiily refers to other observations. I have

never succeeded in producing the agreement of results which is implied by
the smaUness of the probable errors, except by unfair selection among the

discordant primaiy elements of obsei-vation on. which the result is founded.

myT have stated this repeatedly in  Reports to the Board of Visitors (the

whole series of which, I believe, are lodged in the Kew Observatory), and

I have in one at least particularly remarked that the discordance stiU

exists with the very fine instrument now in use at the Royal Observatory.
   Second. Whether the paragraph of my Report is intended in any measure

to apply to dip-observations made at the Kew Observatory, and published in

the publications of the Royal Society ?

   To this I reply that it is intended so to apply, inasmuch as the degree of

accuracy, to which I do not give my assent as real or weU founded, is claimed
for the dip-observations made at the Kew Observatory. In support of my

statement of that claim, I wiU refer to a pamphlet by General Sabine, which

I am unwilling farther to describe, but which, as I am aware, has been

forced on your attention and on that of the other members of the Committee

--of Recommendations of the British Association. In it wiU be found the fol-

lowing sentences: "The probable error of a single observation of the dip

+with reliable instruments of easy procurement is known to be V-5. It

has been shown to be so by a series of 282 observations made at Kew, em-

ploying 12 circles and 24 needles, all of the pattern which has been in use

at Kew for several years past. The observations were made by seven different

observers : the results are published in the ' Proceedings of the Royal Society,'

March 1861, from entries in the Kew Observatoiy books, not a single ob-
                                                                                       c2
XXXVi                           --REPORT 1864.

+serviition having been omitted. The probable error l'-5 ma}? be regarded

as including constant errors, considering the number of different circles and

needles which were emploj^ed, as well as the peculiarities of different ob-

servers, of whom there Averc seven." (The italics are General Sabine's.)

These are the probable en-ors which I cannot accept as accurate.

   It may not be superfluous to add that I have conversed -with several
foreign observers (one of whom has very lately quitted me), and that all

have found discordances comparable to those which I have myself observed.

I have therefore no novelty to claim, except the suggestion (made by mo

some years ago) of instabihty in the position of the magnetic axis, and the
construction (mthin little more than a year) of an instrument whose results

appear to support that suggestion.

   I should be much gratified if the powers of the Kcw Observatoiy could bo

devoted to the examination of this and analogous instrumental difficulties.

These experimental inquiries are not well suited to the system of the esta-

blishment over which 1 preside. And, speaking as a member of the British

Association, I think that the Xew Observatory would be better employed in

that way than in the course which now absorbs so ranch of its strength. It
was originally intended, and in my opinion wisely intended, for the verifica-

tion and improvement of instruments, and not for continuous observations.

If the examination which I propose should be taken up, I shall be happy to

mycooperate, by repetition of observations (as  opportunities might serve),

and by communication of my results.

                                     I am, my dear Sir,

                                                Yours very truly,

Chairman of the Kew Observatory Committee.

                                                                    III.

                                                                        Clapham Common, June 30, 1864.

 My --dear Sib, I have to acknowledge receipt of yours of 2Sth inst.,

wherein you state that the paragraph in your recent report " was intended

to apply to the dip-observations made at Kew, and published in the publica-

tions of the Eoyal Society, inasmuch as the degree of accuracy, to which you

do not give your assent as real or well founded, is claimed for these ob-

servations."

   I have forwarded your letter to Mr. Stewart, the director of the Ob-
servatory, under whose immediate directions the observations were made,
and I hope yon will find that the explanation he will offer will satisfy you

as to the entire truthfulness of the results he obtained, and to the reliability

that should be placed thereon.

    I have always understood, that to the continued magnetical observations

which have been made at Kew Observatory has been mainly due the esta-
blishment of so many magnetical observatories abroad ; it woiild, however,
ill become me to offer to you any opinion as to their value, although I cannot

but regret that they do not appear to have met your approval.

   I am sure it would afford Mr. Stewart, as well as the Members of the

Committee, much pleasure to follow out any experimental iuquiiies which
you may at any time suggest.

                                      Believe me, my dear Sir,

                                                Yours most truly.

                                                 Kew Observatory, Richmond, July 4t,h, 1864:*.

 Mr --DEAR Sre, I have perused Mr. Ally's letter to you, in which he states

that the passage in his lieport to the Board of Visitors, about which you

wrote to him as Chairman of the Kew Committee, was intended to refer to
the dip-obseiTations made at the Kew Observatory, and published in the

publications of the Koyal Society. I have likewise perused your reply, and

now, in accordance with your request, I shall describe the mode of dip-
observation at Kew, in order that you may see that Mr. Airy's remark is

inapplicable to our determinations.

   But before doing so it may be well to state that the list of dip-observa-

tions recorded in the publication to which Mr. Airj- refers is a faithful and

Mycomplete catalogue of those which have been made at this Observatory.

connexion with the publication referred to is therefore this : I look upon it

simply as an authorized and compendious catalogue of the dip-observations

which have been made at Kew; and regarding the method in which tlieso

have been discussed in the publications of the Eoyal Society as not falling

within the scope of my reply, I shall confine myself-to the question of mental

bias, and endeavour to show you that our dip-observations are quite free

from any such source of error.

KewIn the first place, the circles used at         are all of the same pattern

this being one which combines the united experience of several eminent

magneticians, and which they were several years in bringing to perfection.

The circles and needles are all likewise made by the same optician (Mr. Henrj^

Barrow), who has devoted very great pains to the construction of these instni-

ments. I mention this latter circumstance, because in this observation it is

absolutely essential to have a needle constructed with the greatest care.

Before commencing the observation, the fine hard axle of the needle is

gently inserted into a piece of soft cork, in order that it may be thoroughly

cleansed, and the agate knife-edges upon which it is to rest are likewise

rubbed with cork The needle itself has been previously magnetized by being

rubbed ten times on each side from centre to pole by a pair of bar magnets.

After the plane of the magnetic meridian has been determined in the usual

way, the circle is placed in this plane, and the needle is observed in the four

following positions :

I Face of needle to face of instrument .... Face of instrument East.

II. ,,                 ,,       »                  ,,            West.
                                                   ,,
III. Face of needle reversed                 ....      ..

                                                       ,, West.

IV. ,,                 ,,                                         East.

                                                       ..

The poles of the needle are then reversed by ten strokes of the bar magnets
on each side, and the same set of observations is repeated, the mean of the

Avhole eight positions giving the dip.

Both extremities of the needle are in each case successively viewed by

microscopes attached to an arm, which also carries the verniers by means of

which the position is read.     Before making an observation, the needle is
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           _

gently raised frorii its support and lowered again by means of a lifter twice

or thrice, after which its position is noted. I ought likewise to remark that

in magnetizing the needle it is always placed in a wooden frame in such a

manner that the magnets are obliged to pass symmetrically over it.

In this process it appears to me that the only possible effect a mental

xxxviii        REPORT 1864.

bias can be imagined to have is to induce the observer to continue lifting
the needle before reading, until it has come into what he considers the
proper position ; but even this is totally precluded by the method of observa-

tion, for the vernier is not read, and the observer does not know the position

of his needle until it is at rest and the lifting process at an end. Besides,

if the obseiwer did know the position of his needle it would avail him little ;
for while the mean of the eigJit positions is nearly the same for different
instruments, yet the reading of any one position of the needle may be, and

usually is, very different from the true or hnally deduced dip.

   Prom all this it will be seen how little scope there is in the dip-observa-
tions for the operation of mental bias ; but the observers who are supposed

to have worked our instruments with an unconscious predetermination to
produce certain results must have had still more formidable difficulties than
even these to contend with. Por, in order that mental bias should have

operated in the case under discussion, the preconceived idea of uniformity
with which the observer approached the instrument must have varied in such
a measure from season to season and from year to year as to produce in the
results obtained an annual variation, as well as a secular change, and these
of such a nature as to conform with the results of other observatories. Mr.
Airy must acknowledge that the uniformity to which he alludes, and the wish
for which he supposes has created a mental bias, is that which remains after

the annual and secular variations have been allowed for.

   Next, with regard to obsei-vers ; we have frequently at Kew gentlemen

connected with foreign obsei-vatories, who come to receive a magnetical

equipment. Their desire is to obtain the best possible instruments, but at

the same time they view those presented to them with a very critical eye.
One of these was Dr. Bergsma, who spent nearly a month in thoroughly ex-
amining the dip-circle and in suggesting refinements, but who went away

convinced of its accuracy. Seuhor da Soiiza of Coimbra, and Senhor Capello
of Lisbon, have likewise made dip-obsei-vations at Kew, and with the same

object, namely, to satisfy themselves by their own practical experience as to

the best dip-circle with which to furnish their respective observatories.
   I shall only allude to one observer more, who, though he only made a

single observation, has frequently expressed his wish to make a series, but
has hitherto been prevented by his numerous engagements. I speak of Mr.

Glaisher, of Greenwich Observatorj-, who, on 21st October last, obtained

with Circle No. 40 a dip of 63° 12' -2, whHe with Circle No. 33 Mr. Chambers

on 19th and 20th October obtained 68° 12'-3.

  I have thus endeavoured to show that in the Kew dip-observations there

is absolutely no opportunity for mental bias to act, and that even if there

were, many of our observers are not likely to have been the subjects of such

an influence.

myIn thus fidfilliug your request, it is -^dthin  province to notice the

second part of Mr. Airy's letter only in as far as this is connected with the

subject of discussion. You will, therefore, perhaps permit me to refer you

--to the following paragraph of his letter, which 1 shall now quote : ' I

have therefore no novelty to claim, except the suggestion (made by me some

years ago) of instability in the position of the magnetic axis, and the con-

stniction (within little more than a year) of an instrument whose results

appear to support that suggestion. 1 should be much gratified if the powers

of the Kew Observatory could be devoted to the examination of this and
analogous instrumental difficulties. These experimental inquiries are not weU

suited to the system of the estabhshment over which I preside. And, speak-
                      REPORT OF THE KEW COMMITTEE.       XXXIX

ing as a member of the British Association, I think that the Ke-w Observatory-
would be better employed in that way than in the course which now absorbs

so much of its strength. It was originally intended, and in my opinion

wisely intended, for the verification and improvement of instruments, and

not for continuous observations. If the examination which I propose should

be taken up, I should bo happy to cooperate, by repetition of observations

(as my opportunities might serve), and by communication of my results."

These words, while they imply a request which has been courteously

acknowledged by you in your reply, appear also to convey the idea that the

Kew Observatory has left the biu-den of an experimental iuquiiy regarding

dip-circles to the Greenwich establishment, which is not well suited to un-

dertake such a task.

   I think that, whatever opinion be entertained regarding the functions of

the Kew Observatory, it may be shown that it has fulfilled its duties as

respects the dip-circle. I give you the following short sketch of our con-

nexion as an obseiwatory with this problem.

  The Kew Committee, being desirous to promote the construction and em-

ployment of improved magnetical instruments, procured a dip-circle which

was too little known, but which they had reason to think was a good practical

instrument. In making monthly determinations of the dip with this instru-

ment at Kew, and in bringing these before the notice of men of science, the

Committee have given the most convincing experimental proof which it was

in their power to afford of the excellence of this instnmient, and they have

the satisfaction to think that their work has not been in vain, for the

directors of many foreign observatories have supplied themselves with these

circles, and as many as could do it have personally inspected them at Kew.
Mr. Airy appears to have adopted a different course ; as far as I am aware,

he has not yet honoured us with a visit to Kew, in order to inspect our dip-

circle and become personally acquainted with oirr method of observation.

On the other hand, he has instituted experiments of his own, but has not

succeeded in producing a good instrument, and the results which he has thus

obtained have induced him to beUeve that the Kew determinations (although

made with a different instrument, which is also handled in a somewhat

different manner) are not correct.

  The Kew Committee have combated this conclusion, and are not shaken

in their belief that they have obtained a nearly perfect dip-circle. They

may be right or wrong in this opinion ; but while they retain it they cannot

surely be justly reproached with having left to the Greenwich Observatory

the burden of an experimental inquiry which they can only regard as super-

fluous and self-imposed.

 --Mt dear Sir, You were so good as to hold out to me the expectation

that probably the Kew Observatory Committee might be able to assist this

of which two have been before me for several years, and the third has lately
come before me with great force.

1st. You are in some measure aware of the discordances which I have

found in observations of the dipping-needle, made Avith the smallest con-

ceivable change in the circumstances of bearing, or even (as in some experi-

ments which I have lately transmitted to Prof. Stokes) without lifting the

needle at all. I am sure the Kew Observatory would do well in thoroughly

investigating this matter by experiment.
   2nd. I have been troubled for many years with small displacements in

the trace of the vertical-force photograph. I should bo glad to have these

investigated at the Kew Observatory ; but it wiU be necessary for this pur-

pose to modify the adjustments of the vertical-force instrument at Kew,

which at present is incompetent to exhibit such displacements, and masks

all that may ever have occurred.

3rd. I should be very glad indeed to have a set of experiments on the

temperature con-ections of the force of a magnet, made by heating it in liot

Myair instead of by hot water.       own experiments leave us in most distress-

ing doubts.

   It win give me great pleasm-e to cooperate as far as possible with the Kew

Committee in these matters ; any record of our experiments and any ap-

paratus that we can possibly spare wiU be at their command.

ments in relation to magnetic instruments, which I Avill lay before the Kew

Committee at its next meeting.

          dhar Sir, I have i^erused Mr. Airy's letter, addressed to yourself as

Chairman of the Kew Committee, in which he suggests that certain experi-
ments should be made at the Kew Observatory, and I now reply to your

request that I should report concerning this letter for the information of the
Committee.

   From the correspondence which has passed between Mr. Airy and yourself,

--I have little difficulty in finding the proper basis for this report ; the ques-

tion resolves itself into the following: Is it expedient in the interest of
magnetical science that the Committee should undertake these experiments ?

   If the suggestions of Mr. Airy refer to points which have not been settled,
the Committee are surely indebted to him for bringing these before them
but if, on the other hand, it be the opinion of the Committee that these
points have already been discussed and finally disposed of, Mr. Airy cannot
blame them if they decline making the experiments which he suggests.
REPORT OF THE KEW COMMITTEE.  xli

    I -will take these rcqiiests in succession,

   1. His first relates to dip experiments and observations. Abont tAVcnty-
five years ago, a few magneticians, including General Sabine and the late ISir
J ; C. Ross, M'ho were zealous for the advance of magnetical science, set them-
selves to vrork to improve the dip-circle. In this problem they had the ad-
vantage of the cooperation of the late Mr. Robinson, an excellent mecha-

nician, who had also the subject very much at heart, and whose attention
was especially directed to the a.vle of the needle with remarkable success.
On his premature death, his process was continued by Mr. H. Barrow. Other

improvements were afterwards made, and the Kew Observatory having in

the mean time been estabHshed, that institution was not slow to recognize
the practical excellence of this circle, and the Committee felt themselves

able to recommend its general adoption. In order to justify their preference,
they instituted a series of monthly obsei-vations, the result of which, in their
opinion, as weU as in that of very many scientific men, has been to demon-
strate the practical goodness of this instrument. Not fewer than forty-two
of these instruments have been made by Mr. Barrow, and these are, for the

most part, in use in different parts of the globe. Many directors of foreign
observatories who were previously acquainted with other dip-circles, suspect-

ing these to be inferior to that at Kew, have repaired to our observatory for
the purpose of convincing themselves by their own experience that the per-

formance of the Kew circle was not exaggerated. I believe that, Avithout

exception, they have been satisfied with our results ; but I need not dwell
on this topic, as I have akeady in a previous letter endeavoured to show that

our observations arc quite trustworthy.

   It was the wish of General Sabine, who had taken such an active part in
dip-observations, as well as in the construction of the new circle, to exhibit in

a scientific manner the probable error of a complete observation of the dip with

any Kew instrument ; and for this purpose he requested me to furnish him
with a complete Hst of the results obtained at Kew since 1857, omitting none.

    These observations were printed in the publications of the Royal Society,

and I may be admitted to express my belief that, in the method of reduc-

tion employed, the observations were coinbined in the manner most approved
by physicists. I may likewise mention that the probable error therein ob-
tained, small as it is, must not be regarded as wholly due to instrumental

inaccuracy, but in part at least to the occurrence of disturbances during

some of the observations, a source of error which cannot be avoided. If

Mr. Airy will refer to the results of the Kew observations in the Philosophical

Transactions for 1863, art. 12, he wiU see an example of the advantage of
employing an inclinometer with the small probable error of that of Kew, in
problems of much theoretical importance.

   It would thus appear that the Kew Committee have already obtained an

almost perfect dip-ciixle, so that it is not easy to conceive what advantage
is to be derived from the experiments proposed by Mr. Airy, especially since,
in order to obtain the result which he desires, he has only to become per-
sonally acquainted with the working of our instrument, as has been done by

--those scientific men who have already visited Kew for this pm-pose.
   2. Mr. Airy states, " I have been troubled for many years with small

displacements in the trace of the vertical-force photograph. I should be

glad to have these investigated at the Kew Observatory ; but it wiU be neces-

sary for this purpose to modify the adjustments of the vertical-force instru-

ment at Kew, which at present is incompetent to exhibit such displacements,
and masks aU that may ever have occurred."

--xlii REPORT 1864.

    I shall take this request in connexion with the following paragraph from
Mr. Airy's last Report to the Board of Visitors of Greenwich Observatory:

   " The vertical-force magnetometer stUl exhibits sometimes the dislocations
in the photographic trace. There is no evidence, I believe, that these dis-

locations do not exist in the curves of every vertical-force instrument, for
they are always accompanied with vibration ; and no vertical-force instru-
ment, I beUcvo, except that of Greenwich, gives a trace strong enough to
exliibit vibrations, and the dislocations, therefore, with any other instriunent
would appear merely as interruptions of the trace, and would not attract

much attention"*.
    Before discussing Mr. Airy's request, I shall endeavour to show that our

vertical-force instrument is free from objection. In the first place I am able

to state, from having examined our vertical-force ciu'ves in conjunction with

my assistant, that when cause of disturbance takes place the vibrations of

our needle are impressed upon the photographic paper. Whenever a change
takes place in the direction of the forces acting upon a freely suspended
magnet, the impulse is followed, and the magnet, after an interval, which
may be longer or shorter according to its time of vibration, assumes the
new direction. If the changes of force succeed each other more rapidly than
will admit of the magnet becoming stationary between their occurrence, it
does not cease to vibrate until the intervals between the changes become long
enough to permit it to do sof. This state of vibration is quite perceptible

in the photographic records at Kew ; but when the time of vibration is so
small as in the Kew instrument, where it is seven seconds only, the mean

place corresponding to a desired instant is almost always obtainable from the

trace. It may suffice that in the six months from July 1 to December 31,
1863 (the records of which are now imder reduction), and in which there
should be 4416 equidistant hourly positions, there are only five wanting by

reason of failures from all causes whatever. In one of these the disturb-
ance was so excessive that the trace ran off the recording paper ; in the

other four the vibrations corresponding to the fluctuations in the directions
of the disturbing force were too rapid to permit the trace to be sufficiently
distinct for measurement. Should it be hereafter desii-able to investigate

more particularly the phenomena of the changes thus rapidlj" succeeding each

other, a shorter, not a longer, magnet than the one in use at Kew woidd be

 required, having a shorter time of vibration than seven seconds ; but in the

mean time, and for the present wants of science, there is, I think, every
 reason to believe that Mr. Welsh exercised a sound judgment in deter-

mining the dimensions, shape, and weight of the Kew vertical-force magnet.
The self-recording instruments at Kew are now in the seventh year of their

 performance, and the curves of each magnetograph, including those of the
 vertical force, have been carefully examined preparatorj- to reducing them,
 with the view of eliminating everything of the nature of displacements,
 whether due to instrumental defects or to the approach of magnetic matter.
 The curves of the vertical force under this very severe scnitiny have proved
 themselves as perfect as those of the other magnetometers, that is to say,
 they are practically faultless as far as one can judge by this means.

     General Sabine has kindly iiudertaken the reduction of the traces afforded
 by eur magnetographs, and tinds that the vertical-force magnet is capable

    * As far as I am aware, Mr. Airy has not seen any original negative from our vertical-

 force magnetograph.

    f It has already been recognized by Gauss as a law, that no magnet can correctly record
 those changes of which the period is not considerably more than that of its own vibration.
REPORT or THE KEW COMMITTEE.  xliii

of being applied in conjunction with the horizontal force to several important
problems in which the theoretical bearings of the variations of the dip and
total force are concerned, which will be shown as soon as the reductions,
already far advanced, are completed; meanwhile instruments of the same

pattern have been ordered by the directors of several foreign observatories,

who have themselves personally examined the Kew instruments and the

records of their performance, and have expressed their intention of working

in concert with Kew.
   The displacements and dislocations which have occasioned Mr. Aiiy so

much trouble for several years past in the Greenwich vertical-force instru-

ments are obviously due to a cause or causes very different from that which

has been noticed above. From his own description of them, we learn that

the results in one sheet cannot be compared with those in another, and that
in 1859 the vertical-force magnet exhibited for the daily magnetic curve a

form approaching much more nearly to a straight line than it had usually
given. The imperfection of such an instrument is sufficiently manifest,

and it would not be difficult, perhaps, to assign its probable cause or causes;
but as it is no longer designed to be used by Mr. Airy himself, I submit
that it would be inexpedient to employ the time of the observatory in in-

vestigating how much the defect of an instrument which is given up by its

employer may bo due to one cause and how much to another. The Kew

instrument has no such defect ; in other words, it is, to use Mr. Airy's

 expression, " incompetent to exhibit the displacements " (or dislocations)

 which take place in the Greenwich instrument.
    Again, in order to investigate these dislocations experimentally, it would

be necessary that the Committee should dismount our present insti-ument and
mount one similar to that which Mr. Airy has discarded, if not that very
 mag-net itself, and Mr. Airy in his request intimates that some such change
would be necessary. To dismount an instrument so usefully employed as that
 at Kew, and with the performance of which for the purposes for which it was

 devised we have reason to be fully satisfied, for the chance of^ constructing

 one of a different form, which might probably not give us equal satisfaction,

would seem to be a species of treason to the branch of science which we
 are endeavoimng to advance, as well as to ourselves, and to those who have
 provided themselves with similar instruments to work in concert with us.

    3. Mr. Airy's third request is that we should make experiments in order

 to determine if there be any difference in the temperature correction as de-

 rived when the magnet employed is placed in hot and cold air instead of in

 water, as is usually the case.

    Let me first of all direct your attention to the principle on which the Kew

 Committee have proceeded for several years past in reference to the subject

 of temperature corrections. This principle has been to avoid, as far as
jjossible, the occasion for such corrections, and the Committee will be glad to
 learn that Mr. Airy has latterly expressed his intention of adoptiog the same

 principle. At the Kew Obseiwatory the variation of temperatm-e to which

 the magnetographs are exposed is ouly half a degree Fahr. in twenty-four
 hours. In like manner, in the instniment for absolute determinations, by

 making the deflections and vibrations sufficiently near to one another in
 point of time, the correction for temperatiu-e is reduced to a minimum.

     But in former days a number of experiments were made on the temperature
 correction, some with the purpose of proving that magnetic changes are not
 caused by the varying temperature of the aii-, and others which exactly cor-
 respond to the point referred to by Mr. Airy, and these lead to the belief that
Xliv                         REPORT 18G4'.

temperature corrections determined by hot and cold water experiments arc

almost identical with those determined by hot and cold air.

I find that at Toronto the temperature change of the vertical-force magnet

found by comparing together days of different natural temperature was

·00011 for 1° Fahr., while the same dctei-mined by hot and cold water

experiments was -00009. At Makerstoun, also, the temperature correction

of the balance magnet, as determined by hot and cold days, was -000071),

while that determined by hot and cold water experiments was -000073.

These agreements are very near, and the first had induced General f?abinc

to remark that the hot and cold water method was sufficiently correct; while

the same conclusion was also arrived at by Mr. Broun of Makerstoun, and,

as far as I am aware, has been generally received.

It is impossible for me, after such evidence that both methods give very

nearly the same corrections, to doubt that Mr. Airy's vcrij great difference

must have been occasioned by error of experiment.

As a principle, Mr. Aiiy will, I think, allow that in such an experiment

it is better to have the hot and cold air filling a whole room than filling

only a copper box ; while at the same time it may be extremely difficult to

indicate the precise source of error in his arrangement. I do not think

that the Kew Committee are called upon to undertake this task, especially

since (as has been shown) the comparison of corrections derived from heated

air and heated water Ims already received due attention, the result of which

has been to set that matter at rest in the minds of other magneticians ; and

also since the temperature corrections which will be hereafter required at

Greenwich will not be of such magnitude as heretofore, and therefore are not

likely to occasion Mi'. Airy the same distressing doubts as those spoken of

by him.

The two following letters, although of later date than the Kew Report, have

          been attached to this correspondence by order of the Council.

                                                Eoyal Observatory, Greenwich, S.E., 1864, October 19th.

 --Mt dear Sir, I have to thank you for your kindness in transmitting for

my inspection the Kew Vertical-Force Photograms for the months of June,

July, and August 1863. They shall be returned by hand at an early oppor-
tunity. I have examined them with much interest, and take leave to com-
municate to you the following remarks on them.

   1. The curves are traced more strongly than those which I had previously
seen. I think this change a great improvement.

 --2. The sheets are very neat, uniform, and distinct more uniform than the

Greenwich sheets have been to the end of 1^03, but, I think, not more
uniform than the Greenwich sheets are now. This change in the Greenwich
sheets, I beheve, is to be attributed entirely to our gain of nearly uniform
temperature, every part of our chemical process being the same as formerly.

 --3. The small perturbations are recorded with great delicacy more clearly

than in the former Greenwich sheets (though I believe that nearly all can

be traced in our curves), but not more clearly than in our new sheets. I
make the latter statement from examination of the general character of both,

as I have not been able to compare corresponding sheets.

4. The vibrations of the magnet arc not well shown. The largest are those

of June 9'^ 2" 10'" (some doubt about this), June 20'' 14'^ 1 7'", and July 30" 0'' 8"^;

all these are really small, yet they are exhibited very feebly. It seems pro-

bable that a larger vibration would leave no visible trace.

5. I conclude from this that very violent and rapid changes of magnetism

could not be shown.

6. In this respect the process used at Greenwich (fully detailed in the

" Magnetical and Meteorological Eesults," 1862), which appears to be more

sensitive to rax)id movements, seems preferable to that used at Kew. I do

not propose to make any change for our magnetic instruments ; although for

our exposed thermometers, in which the changes are not sudden, is yet under

consideration whether a process hkc that of Kew shoidd be introduced.
   7. I find upon close inspection that the Kew curves are not free from dis-

locations ; these are, however, smaller than those of the Greenwich curves.

A few of them have caught tlie attention of the Kew observer, and are in-

dicated by dots of red ink. Among these, I think, are June 17" 23'' 50",

and June 19" 22'' 40'". But there are many others (all small), as Jime

23" 23" 40"\ June 29" 23" 0'", July 1" 21" 30TM, July 3" 22" 50'", 23" 30'",

23'' 35'", &e. etc. ; July 13" 5" 0'" (which I note as occurring at a different hour

of the day), &c. These are imimportant as affecting the readings of the

curves, but not unimportant as affecting the possible explanation.

8. The comparison of the readings at Greenwich and at Kew, on days when

tlie dislocations at Greenwich are sensible, entirely supports the view which

I have entertained for many years, that the dislocations are transient phe-

nomena, in no wise affecting the zero-measurement, and whose effects can by

judicious attention be entirely remedied.

                                             I am, my dear Sir,

                                        Eoyal Observatory, Greenwich, S.E., 18G4, November 15th.

 --My dear Sir, You are aware, perhaps, that Mr. Glaisher has visited

the Kew Observatory, and that Mr. B. Stewart and Mr. "Whipple have

visited this Observatory, and that two of the Kew Dip iustniments have

been transported backwards and forwards ; and that observations have been

made \nih. them by all the gentlemen Avhom I have mentioned, at Green-

wich  and  at  Kew                      and that during these operations I have myself carefully
                                     ;

examined the principal parts of the instruments, though I have not made

any complete observations with them. The result of these operations is as

follows :

1. As far as depends on the mechanical construction, of the instruments

including the needles, the workmanship of the instruments (I am not now

speaking of the extent of applicability but of the workmanship of the important

parts) is very good, of the same class as ours ; I think ours better in some

respects, but they may be considered as the same class.

2. As regards the results of observations, those made with the Kew instru-

ments are consistent to a degree which I never saw before. And in the

experiment which, as made with our needles, has perplexed me most, namely,

that of rotating the instrument in azimuth Avithout touching or lifting the

needles, and remarking the change in their indications, the Kew needles

appear to be nearly or entirely free from such change.

REPORT OF THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE.                 xlvii

The results for Dip obtainable with the Kew Dip instruments are un-

doubtedly more consistent and more certain than I had supposed them to be.

In considering the possible cause of this difference in the phenomena of

the two sets of needles, I am led to the strong belief that it is not in any way
mechanical. The mechanical structure and treatment is the same. I am

inclined to suppose that it depends on the original quality and the subsequent

tempering of the steel. I am not aware that the Kew Committee have

published anything on this point.

                                   I am, my dear Sir,

                                   Yours very truly,

John P. Gassiot, Esq.,             (Signed)            G. B. Airy.

Chairman of the Kew Committee.

Report of the Parliamentary Committee to the Meeting of the British
                          Association at Bath, September 186-1.

   The Parliamentary Committee have the honour to report as foUows :
   The Dukes of Devonshire and Argyll, the Earls of Harrowby and Ennis-
killen, and Sir John Pakingtou, have vacated their seats, but youi* Committee
recommend their re-election.
   Your Committee recommend that the Vacancy in the House of Commons'
List be supplied by the election of Mr. Goschen.
   Your Committee suggest that they should be permitted to propose for
Election Members of either House of Parliament, in addition to the thirteen
Members now constituting their Committee, whenever such addition may

appear desirable.

   These additional Members might be considered as Supernumerary, and any
Vacancy ia the Supernumerary List supplied, or not, as may be thought ex-
pedient, when the Vacancy occurs.

   Your Committee also recommend that a Resolution, passed at Liverpool in
1854, be rescinded, and the following substituted :

   " That any Member of the Parliamentary .(Committee, who shall not attend

any one of four consecutive Meetings of that Committee, shall be considered
as having resigned, but shall be eligible for re-election."

   No subject was referred to your Committee at Newcastle, but several of its
Members have supported, or signified their intention to support, the valuable

suggestion of the Royal Commissioners, that the study of Natural Science
should be introduced into certain Public Schools, and likewise the Bill for
legalizing the use of the Metric System of "Weights and Measures.

    In thus acting, the Committee conceive that they are properly fulfilling the
important duty imposed upon them of " Watching over the interests of

Science."

                                                                               Weotteslet, Chairman.

                                                         BY

SIR CHARLES LYELL, Bart., LL.D., D.C.L., F.R.S., &c.

--Gentlemen of the British Association, The place where we have been

invited this year to hold our Thirty-fourth Meeting is one of no ordinary
interest to the cultivators of physical science. It might have been selected

by my feUow-labourers in geology as a central point of observation, from

which, by short excursions to the east and west, they might examine those

rocks wMch constitute, on the one side, the more modem, and on the other

the more ancient records of the past, while around them and at their feet lie
monuments of the middle period of the earth's history. But there are other
sites in England which might successfully compete with Bath as good sur-

veying stations for the geologist. What renders Bath a peculiar point of

attraction to the student of natural phenomena is its thermal and mineral
waters, to the sanatory powers of which the city has owed its origin and
celebrity. The great volume and high temperature of these waters render
them not only unique in our island, but perhaps without a parallel in the rest

of Europe, when we duly take into account their distance from the nearest
region of violent earthquakes or of active or extinct volcanos. The spot
where they issue, as we learn from the researches of the historian and anti-
quary, was lonely and desert when the Romans first landed in this island,

but in a few years it was converted into one of the chief cities of the newly

conquered province. On the site of the hot springs was a large morass from

which clouds of white vapour rose into the air ; and there first was the
spacious bath-room built, in a highly ornamental style of architecture, and

decorated with colimms, pUasters, and tessellated pavements. By its side
was erected a splendid temple dedicated to Minerva, of which some statues

and altars with their inscriptions, and ornate pillars are still to be seen in

the Museum of this place. To these edifices the quarters of the garrison, and
in the course of time the dweUings of new settlers, were added ; and they

were all encircled by a massive wall, the solid foundations of which still

remain.

   A dense mass of soil and rubbish, from 10 to 20 feet thick, now separates

the level on which the present city stands from the level of the ancient
Aquae SoHs of the Eomans. Digging through this mass of heterogeneous
materials, coins and coffins of the Saxon period have been found ; and lower
down, beginning at the depth of fi'om 12 to 15 feet from the surface, coins
have been disinterred of Imperial Rome, bearing dates from the reign of
Claudius to that of Maximus in the fifth century. Beneath the whole are
occasionally seen tessellated pavements stiU retaining their bright colours,
one of which, on the site of the Mineral-water Hospital, is still carefully pre-
served, affording us an opportimity of gauging the difference of level of ancient

and modem Bath.
ADDRESS.  Ixi

   On the slopes and summits of the picturesque hills in the neighbourhood
rose many a Koman villa, to trace the boundaries of which, and to bring to

light the treasures of art concealed in them, are tasks which have of late years
amply rewarded the researches of Mr. Scarth and other learned antiquaries.

No wonder that on this favoured spot we should meet with so many memo-
rials of former greatness, when we reflect on the length of time during which

the imperial troops and rich colonists of a highly civilized people sojourned

here, having held undisturbed possession of the coimtry for as many years as
have elapsed from the first discovery of America to our own times.

   One of our former Presidents, Dr. Daubeny, has remarked that nearly aU
the most celebrated hot springs of Europe, such as those of Aix-la-Chapelle,
Baden-Baden, Naples, Auvergne, and the Pyrenees, have not declined in
temperature since the days of the Romans; for many of them stUl retain as
great a heat as is tolerable to the human body, and yet when employed by the
ancients they do not seem to have required to be first cooled down by arti-
ficial means. This uniformity of temperature, maintained in some places for
more than 2000 years, together with the constancy in the volume of the
water, which never varies with the seasons, as in ordinary springs, the

identity also of the mineral ingredients which, century after century, are held
by each spring in solution, are striking facts, and they tempt us irresistibly
to speculate on the deep subterranean sources both of the heat and mineral

matter. How long has this uniformity prevailed? Are the springs really

ancient in reference to the earth's history, or, like the course of the present

rivers and the actual shape of our hiUs and valleys, are they only of high

antiquity when contrasted with the brief space of human annals ? May they

not be like Vesuvius and Etna, which, although Ihey have been adding to

their flanks, in the course of the last 2000 years many a stream of lava and
shower of ashes, were still mountains very much the same as they now are
in height and dimensions from the earliest times to which we can trace back

their existence ? Yet although their foundations are tens of thousands of

years old, they were laid at an era when the Mediterranean was already
inhabited by the same species of marine shells as those with which it is now
peopled ; so that these volcanos must be regarded as things of yesterday in

the geological calendar.

    Notwithstanding the general persistency in character of mineral waters

and hot springs ever since they were first known to us, we find on inquiry

that some few of them, even in historical times, have been subject to great
changes. These have happened during earthquakes which have been violent
enough to disturb the subterranean drainage and alter the shape of the
fissures up which the waters ascend. Thus during the great earthquake at

Lisbon in 1755, the temperature of the spring called La Source de la Eeine
at Bagneres de Luchon, in the Pyrenees, was suddenly raised as much as
75° F., or changed from a cold spring to one of 122° F., a heat which it has

since retained. It is also recorded that the hot springs at Bagneres de
Bigorre, in the same mountain-chain, became suddenly cold during a great

earthquake which, in 1660, threw down several houses in that town.
   It has been ascertained that the hot springs of the Pyrenees, the Alps, and

many other regions are situated in lines along which the rocks have been

rent, and usually where they have been displaced or "faulted." Similar

dislocations in the solid crust of the earth are generally supposed to have
determined the spots where active and extinct volcanos have burst forth ; for
several of these often affect a linear arrangement, their position seeming to
have been determined by great lines of fissure. Another connecting link

REPORT 1864.

between the volcano and tlie hot spring is recognizable in the great abundance
of hot springs in regions where volcanic eruptions stiU occur from time to
time. It is also in the same districts that the waters occasionally attain the
boiliug-temperature, while some of the associated stufas emit steam consider-

ably above the boiling-point. 13ut in proportion as we recede from the great
centres of igneous activity, we find the thermal waters decreasing in fre-
quency and in their average heat, while at the same time they are most con-

spicuous in those territories where, as in Central France or the Eifcl in
Germany, there are cones and craters stiU so perfect in their form, and
streams of lava bearing such a relation to the depth and shape of the existing
valleys, as to indicate that the internal fires have become dormant in com-
paratively recent times. If there be exceptions to this rule, it is where
hot springs are met with in parts of the Alps and Pyrenees which have been
violently convulsed by modern earthquakes.

   To pursue still further our comparison between the hot spring and the
volcano, we may regard the water of the spring as representing those vast
clouds of aqueous vapour which are copiously evolved for days, sometimes for
weeks, in succession from craters during an eruption. But we shall perhaps
be asked whether, when we contrast the work done by the two agents in

--question, there is not a marked failure of analogy in one respect namely a

want, in the case of the hot spring, of power to raise from great depths in the
earth voluminous masses of solid matter corresponding to the heaps of scoritE

and streams of lava which the volcano pours out on the surface. To one who
urges such an objection it may be said that the quantity of solid as well

as gaseous matter transferred by springs from the interior of the earth to its
surface is far more considerable than is commonly imagined. The thermal
waters of Bath are far from being conspicuous among European hot springs
for the quantity of mineral matter contained in them in proportion to the
water which acts as a solvent ; yet Professor Eamsay has calculated that if
the sulphates of lime and of soda, and the chlorides of sodium and magnesium,
and the other mineral ingredients which they contain, were solidified, they
would form in one year a square column 9 feet in diameter, and no less than

140 feet in height. All this matter is now quietly conveyed by a stream of
limpid water, in an invisible form, to the Avon, and by the Avon to the sea

but if, instead of being thus removed, it were deposited around the orifice of
eruption, like the siliceous layers which encrust the circidar basin of an

Icelandic geyser, we should soon see a considerable cone biiilt up, with a crater

in the middle ; and if the action of the spring were intermittent, so that ten

or twenty years should elapse between the periods when solid matter was

emitted, or (say) an interval of three centuries, as in the case of Vesuvius

between 1306 and 1631, the discharge would be on so grand a scale as to
afford no mean object of comparison with the intermittent outpourings of a

volcano.

   Dr. Daubeny, after devoting a month to the analysis of the Bath waters

in 1833, ascertained that the daily evolution of nitrogen gas amounted to no
less than 250 cubic feet in volume. This gas, he remarks, is not only cha-
racteristic of hot springs, but is largely disengaged from volcanic craters

during eruptions. In both cases he suggests that the nitrogen may be

derived from atmospheric air, which is always dissolved in rain-water, and

which, when this water penetrates the earth's crust, must be carried down
to great depths, so as to reach the heated interior. When there, it may

be subjected to deoxidating processes, so that the nitrogen, being left in a

free state, may be driven upwards by the expansive force of heat and steam, or
ADDRESS.  Ixiii

by hydrostatic pressure. This theory has been very generally adopted, as best
accounting for the constant disengagement of large bodies of nitrogen, even
where the rocks through which the spriug rises are crystalline and unfossili-

ferous. It %vill, however, of coiirse be admitted, as Professor Bischoff has
pointed out, that in some places organic matter has supplied a large part

of the nitrogen evolved.

    Carbonic-acid gas is another of the volatilized substances discharged by

the Bath waters. Dr. Gustav Bischoff, in the new edition of his valuable
work on chemical and physical geology, when speaking of the exhalations

of this gas, remarks that they are of universal occurrence, and that they

originate at great depths, becoming more abundant the deeper we penetrate.
He also observes that, when the silicates which enter so largely into the

composition of the oldest rocks are percolated by this gas, they must be con-
tinually decomposed, and the carbonates formed by the new combinations
thence arising must often augment the volume of the altered rocks. This
increase of bulk, he says, must sometimes give rise to a mechanical force of

expansion capable of uplifting the incumbent crust of the earth ; and the

same force may act laterally so as to compress, dislocate, and tilt the strata
on each side of a mass in which the new chemical changes are developed.
The calciilations made by this eminent German chemist of the exact amount
of distention which the origin of new mineral products may cause, by adding

to the volume of the rocks, deserve the attention of geologists, as affording

--them aid in explaining those reiterated oscillations of level those risings

--and sinkings of land which have occurred on so grand a scale at successive

periods of the past. There are probably many distinct causes of such
upward, downward, and lateral movements, and any new suggestion on this

head is most welcome ; but I believe the expansion and contraction of solid
rocks, when they are alternately heated and cooled, and the fusion and sub-

sequent consolidation of mineral masses, will continue to rank, as heretofore,

as the most influential causes of such movements.
    The temperature of the Bath waters varies in the different springs

from 117° to 120° F. This, as before stated, is exceptionally high, when we

 duly allow for the great distance of Bath from the nearest region of active
or recently extinct volcanos and of violent earthquakes. The hot springs of

Aix-la-Chapelle have a much higher temperature, viz. 135° F., but they are

 situated within forty miles of those cones and lava-streams of the Eifel

 which, though they may have spent their force ages before the earliest

 records of history, belong, nevertheless, to the most modern geological period.

--Bath is about 400 miles distant from the same part of Germany, and 440 from

 Auvergne another volcanic region, the latest eruptions of which were geolo-

gically coeval Avith those of the Eifel. When these two regions in France
 and Germany were the theatres of frequent convulsions, we may well suppose
 that England was often more rudely shaken than now ; and such shocks as

 that of October last, the sound and rocking motion of which caused so great
 a sensation as it traversed the southern part of the island, and seems to have

 been particularly violent in Herefordshire, may be only a languid reminder

 to us of a force of which the energy has been gradually dying oiit.

    If you consult the geological map of the environs of this city, coloured by

 the Government surveyors, you will perceive that numerous lines of fault or
 displacement of the rocks are there laid down, and one of these has shifted
 the strata vertically as much as 200 feet. Mr. Charles Moore pointed oiit to

 me last spring, when I had the advantage of examining the geology of this

 district under his guidance, that there are other lines of displacement not yet
--Ixiv
REPORT 1864.

  laid down on the Ordnance Map, the existence of which must be inferred from
  the different levels at which the same formations crop out on the flanks of the
  hills to the north and south of the city. I have therefore httle doubt that
  the Bath springs, like most other thermal waters, mark the site of some great
  convulsion and fracture which took place in the crust of the earth at some

 --former period perhaps not a very remote one, geologically speaking. The

  uppermost part of the rent through which the hot water rises is situated in

  horizontal strata of Lias and Trias, 300 feet thick; and this may be more

  modern than the lower part, which passes through the inclined and broken
   strata of the subjacent coal-measures, which are unconformable to the Trias.
  The nature and succession of these rocks penetrated by the Bath waters was
I first made out by the late "WiUiam Smith in 1817, when a shaft was sunk in
  the vicinity in search for coal. The shock which opened a communication
  through the upper rocks may have been of a much later date than that which
  fractured the older and underlying strata ; for there is a tendency in the
  earth's crust to jdeld most readily along hues of ancient fracture, which con-
  stitute the points of least resistance to a force acting from below.

     If we adopt the theory already alluded to, that the nitrogen is derived
  from the deoxidation of atmospheric air carried down by rain-water, we
  may imagine the supply of this water to be furnished by some mountainous

  region, possibly a distant one, and that it descends through rents or porous
  rocks tiU it encounters some mass of heated matter by which it is converted
  into steam, and then driven upwards through a fissure. In its downward

  passage the water may derive its sulphate of lime, chloride of calcium, and

  other substances from the decomposition of the gypseous, saline, calcareous,
  and other constituents of the rocks which it permeates. The greater part of

  the ingredients are common to sea-water, and might suggest the theory of a
  marine origin ; but the analysis of the Bath springs by Merck and Galloway

  shows that the relative proportion of the solid matter is far from agreeing
  with that of the sea, the chloride of magnesium being absolutely in excess, that

  is, 14 grains of it per gallon for 12 of common salt ; whereas in sea-water
  there are 27 grains of salt, or chloride of sodium, to 4 of the chloride of mag-
  nesium. That some mineral springs, however, may derive an inexhaustible

   supply, through rents and porous rocks, from the leaky bed of the ocean, is

  by no means an unreasonable theory, especially if we believe that the con-

  tiguity of nearly all the active volcanos to the sea is connected with the

   access of salt water to the subterranean foci of volcanic heat.

      Professor Roscoe, of Manchester, has been lately engaged in making a
  careful analysis of the Bath waters, and has discovered in them three metals

 --which they were not previously known to contain namely copper, stron-

   tium, and lithium ; but he has searched in vain for caesium and rubidium,

  those new metals, the existence of which has been revealed to us in the
  course of the last few years by what is called spectrum analysis. By this
  new method the presence of infinitesimal quantities, such as would have
  wholly escaped detection by ordinaiy tests, are made known to the eye by

   the agency of light. Thus, for example, a solid substance such as the

   residue obtained by evaporation from a mineral water is introduced on a
  platinum wii'e into a colourless gas-flame. The substance thus volatilized
  imparts its colour to the flame, and the light, being then made to pass

   through a prism, is viewed through a small telescope or spectroscope, as it is

   called, by the aid of which one or more bright lines or bands are seen in the

   spectrum, which, according to their position, number, and colour, indicate the

  presence of different elementary bodies.

of this new test to the hot waters of Baden-Baden and of Diirkheini in
the Palatinate. He observed in the spectrum some coloured lines of which

he could not interpret the meaning, and was determined not to rest till ho

had found out what they meant. This was no easy task, for it was neces-

sary to evaporate fifty tons of water to obtain 200 grains of what proved to

be two new metals. Taken together, their proportion to the water was only
as one to three million. He named the first cfesium, from the blnish-grey lines

which it presented in the spectrum ; and the second rubidium, from its two

red lines. Since these successful exi)erimcnts were made, thallium, so called

from its green line, was discovered in 1861 by Mr. Crookes ; and a foiu-th

metal named indium, from its indigo-coloured band, was detected by Pro-

fessor Eichter, of Freiberg, in Saxony in a zinc ore of the Hartz. It is

impossible not to suspect that the wonderful efficacy of some mineral springs,

both cold and thermal, in ciuing diseases, which no artificially prepared

waters have as yet been able to rival, may bo connected vdth the presence

of one or more of these elementary bodies previously unknown ; and some of

the newly found ingredients, when procured in larger quantities, may furnish

medical science with means of combating diseases which have hitherto baffled

aU himian skill.

  "While I was pursuing my inquiries respecting the Bath waters, I learned

casually that a hot spring had been discovered at a great depth in a copper-

mine near Ecdruth in Cornwall, having about as high a temperature as that of

the Bath waters, and of which, strange to say, no account has yet been

published. It seems that, in the year 1839, a level was driven from an old

shaft so as to intersect a rich copper-mine at the depth of 1350 feet from

the surface. This lode or metalhferous fissure occurred in what were for-

merly called the United Mines, and which have since been named the Clif-

ford Amalgamated Mines. Through the contents of the lode a powerful

spring of hot water was observed to rise, which has continued to flow with

undiminished strength ever since. At my request, Mr. Horton Davey, of

Redruth, had the kindness to send up to London many gallons of this water,

which have been analyzed by Professor WiUiam Allen Miller, F.R.S., who

finds that the quantity of solid matter is so great as to exceed by more than

four times the proportion of that yielded by the Bath waters. Its compo-

sition is also in many respects very different ; for it contains but little sul-

phate of lime, and is almost free from tlie salts of magnesium. It is rich in

the chlorides of calcium and sodiiim, and it contains one of the new metals-

caesium, never before detected in any mineral spring in England: but its

peculiar characteristic is the extraordinary abundance of lithium, of which a

mere trace had been found by Professor Roscoe in the Bath waters ; whereas

in this Cornish hot spring this metal constitutes no less than a twenty-sixth

part of the whole of the solid contents, which, as before stated, are so volu-

minous. "When Professor Miller exposed some of these contents to the test of

spectrum analysis, he gave mc an opportunity of seeing the beautiful bright

crimson line which the lithium produces in the spectrum.

Lithium was first made known in 1817 by Arfvedsen, who extracted it

from petalite ; and it was believed to be extremely rare, until Bunsen and

Kii-chhoff, in 1860, by means of spectnim analysis, showed that it was a most

widely diffused substance, existing in minute quantities in almost all mineral

waters and in the sea, as well as in milk, human blood, and the ashes of some

plants. It has already been used in medicine, and we may therefore hope
that, now that it is obtainable in large quantities, and at a much cheaper rate

than before the Wheal- Clifford hot spring was analyzed, it may become of
high value. According to a rough estimate which has been sent to me by Mr.

Davey, the Wheal-Clifford spring yields no less than 250 gallons per minute,
which is almost equal to the discharge of the King's Bath or chief spring of

--this city. As to the gases emitted, they are the same as those of the Bath

water namely carbonic acid, oxygen, and nitrogen.
   Mr. Wartngton Smyth, who had already visited the Wheal-Clififord lode

in 1855, re-examined it in July last, chiefly with the view of replying to

several queries which I had put to him ; and, in spite of the stifling heat,
ascertained the geological structure of the lode and the exact temperature of
the water. This last he foimd to be 122° Fahr. at the depth of 1350 feet
but he scarcely doubts that the thermometer would stand two or three
degrees higher at a distance of 200 feet to the eastward, where the water is
known to gush up more freely. The Wheal-Clifford lode is a fissure varying
in width from 6 to 12 feet, one wall consisting of elvan or porphyritic
granite, and the other of kiUas or clay-slate. Along the line of the rent,
which runs east and west, there has been a slight throw or shift of the rocks.
The vein-stuff is chiefly formed of cellular pyrites of copper and iron, the
porous nature of which allows the hot water to percolate freely through it.
It seems, however, that in the continuation upwards of the same fissure
little or no metalliferous ore was deposited, but, in its place, quartz and other

impermeable substances, which obstructed the coui'se of the hot spring, so as
to prevent its flowing out on the sui-face of the countiy. It has been always
a favourite theory of the miners that the high temperatm-e of this Cornish
spring is due to the oxidation of the sulphurets of copper and iron, which are

decomposed when air is admitted. That such oxidation must have some

slight effect is undeniable ; but that it materially influences the temperature
of so large a body of water is out of the question. Its effect must be almost
insensible ; for Professor MUler has scarcely been able to detect any
sulphuric acid in the water, and a minute trace only of iron and copper in

solution.

   When we compare the temperatm-o of the Bath springs, which issue at a

level of less than 100 feet above the sea, with the Wheal-Clifford spring found

at a depth of 1350 feet from the surface, we must of course make allowance for
the increase of heat always experienced when we descend into the interior
of the earth. The difference would amount to about 20° Fahr., if we adopt

the estimate deduced by Mr. Hopkins from an accurate series of observations
made in the Monkwearmouth shaft, near Durham, and in the Dukinfield
shaft, near Manchester, each of them 2000 feet in depth. In these shafts
the temperatiu-e was found to rise at the rate of only 1° Fahi-. for fiyerj
increase of depth of from 65 to 70 feet. But if the Wlieal-Clifford spring,

instead of being arrested in its upward course, had continued to rise freely
through porous and loose materials so as to reach the sm-face, it would
probably not have lost anything approaching to 20° Fahr., since the re-
newed heat derived fi-om below would have warmed the waUs and contents
of the lode, so as to raise their temperature above that which would naturally
belong to the rocks at corresponding levels on each side of the lode. The
almost entire absence of magnesium raises an obvious objection to the hypo-

thesis of this spring deriving its waters from the sea ; or if such a soui'ce be

suggested for the salt and other marine products, we should be under the
necessity of supposing the magnesium to be left behind in combination with

some of the elements of the decomposed and altered rocks through which the

thermal waters may have passed.

ADDRESS.  Ixvii

   Hot springs are, for the most part, charged with alkaline and other highly-

soluble substances, and, as a rule, are barren of the precious metals, gold,

silver, and copper, as weU as of tin, platinum, lead, and many others, a

slight trace of copper in the Bath waters being exceptional. Never-
theless there is a strong presumption that there exists some relation-
ship between the action of thermal waters and the fiUing of rents with
metallic ores. The component elements of these ores may, in the first
instance, rise from great depths in a state of sublimation or of solution

in intensely heated water, and may then be precipitated on the walls of a

fissure as soon as the ascending vapours or fluids begin to part with some of
their heat. Almost everything, save the alkaline metals, silica, and cer-

tain gases, may thus be left behind long before the spring reaches the earth's

surface. If this theory be adopted, it wiU foUow that the metalliferous por-
tion of a iissure, originally thousands of feet or fathoms deep, wiU never be
exposed in regions accessible to the miner until it has been upheaved by a long
series of convulsions, and until the higher parts of the same rent, together
with its contents and the rocks which it had traversed, have been removed
by aqueous denudation. Ages before such changes are accomplished ther-
mal and mineral springs will have ceased to act ; so that the want of identity
between the mineral ingredients of hot spiings and the contents of metal-

liferous veins, instead of militating against their intimate relationship,

is in favour of both being the complementary results of one and the same

natural operation.

    But there are other characters in the structure of the earth's crust more
mysterious in their nature than the phenomena of metalliferous veins, on

--which the study of hot springs has thrown light I allude to the metamor-

phism of sedimentary rocks. Strata of various ages, many of them once

full of organic remains, have been rendered partially or wholly crystal-
line. It is admitted on aU hands that heat has been instrumental in

bringing about this re-arrangement of particles, which, when the meta-
morphism has been carried out to its fullest extent, obliterates all trace
of the imbedded fossils. But as mountain-masses many miles in length and

breadth, and several thousands of feet in height, have undergone such
alteration, it has always been difficult to explain in what manner an amount
of heat capable of so entirely changing the molecular condition of sedimen-
tary masses could have come into play without utterly annihilating every

 sign of stratification, as well as of organic structure.

    Various experiments have led to the conclusion that the minerals which
 enter most largely into the composition of the metamorphic rocks have not
been formed by crystallizing from a state of fusion, or in the dry way, but

--that they have been derived from liquid solutions, or in the wet way

 jirocess requiring a far less intense degree of heat. Thermal springs, charged
with carbonic acid and with hydrofluoric acid (which last is often present in
 smaU quantities), are powerful causes of decomposition and chemical reaction
 in rocks through which they percolate. If, therefore, large bodies of hot water

permeate moimtain-masses at great depths, they may in the course of ages

 superinduce in them a crystalline structure ; and in some cases strata in a

 lower position and of older date may be comparatively unaltered, retaining

 their fossU remains imdefaced, while newer rocks are rendered metamorphic.

 This may happen where the waters, after passing upwards for thousands of

 feet, meet with some obstruction, as in the case of the Wheal-Clifibrd spring,
 causing the same to be laterally diverted so as to percolate the surrounding
 rocks. The efficacy of such hydrothermal action has been admirablv iUus-

                                                                                     e2

trated of late years by the experiments and observations of Scnarmont,
Daubree, Delesse, Schcerer, Sorby, 8tcrry Hunt, aod others.

   The changes which Daubree lias shov.^u to have been produced by the
alkaline waters of Plombieres, in the Vosges, are more especially instructive.
These thermal waters have a temperature of 160° F., and were conveyed by
the llomans to Ijaths through long conduits or aqueducts. The foundations
of some of their works consisted of a bed of concrete made of lime, frag-
ments of brick, and sandstone. Through this and other masonry the hot
waters have been percolating for centuries, and have given rise to various

--zeolites apophyllite and chabazite among others ; also to calcareous spar,

arragonite, and iluor spar, together with siliceous minerals, such as opal,

all found in the interspaces of the bricks and mortar, or constituting part of

their rearranged materials. The quantity of heat brought into action in this
instance in the course of 2000 years has, no doubt, been enormous, although
the intensity of it developed at any one moment has been always incon-

siderable.

    The study, of late years, of the constituent parts of granite has in like
manner led to the conclusion that their consolidation has taken place at
temperatures far below those formerly supposed to be indispensable. Gustav

Eose has pointed out that the quartz of granite has the specific gravity

of 2-6, which characteriz;cs silica when it is precipitated from a liquid
solvent, and not that inferior density, namely 2-3, which belongs to it when

it cools and solidifies in the dry way from a state of fusion.
   But some geologists, when made aware of the intervention on a large

scale, of water, in the formation of the component minerals of the granitic

and volcanic rocks, appear of late years to have been too much disposed to
dispense with intense heat when accounting for the formation of the crystal-

line and unstratified roclcs. As water in a state of solid combination enters
largely into the aluminous and some other minerals, and therefore plays no
smaU part in the composition of the earth's crust, it follows that, when rocks
are melted, water must be present, independently of the supplies of rain-
water and sea-water which find their way into the regions of siibterranean
heat. But the existence of water under great pressure affords no argument
against our attributing an excessively high temperature to the mass with
which it is mixed up. StiU less does the point to which the melted matter

must be cooled down before it consolidates or crystallizes into lava or granite
afford any test of the degree of heat which the same matter must have
acquired when it was melted and made to fonn lakes and seas in the interior

of the earth's crust.

We learn from Bunsen's experiments on the Great Geyser in Iceland, that

at the depth of only seventy-four feet, at the bottom of the tube, a column of

water may be in a state of rest, and yet possess a heat of 120° Centigrade, or

248° F. What, then, may not the temperature of such water be at the depth

of a few thousand feet ?  It  might  soon  attain  a white  heat  under pressure
                                                                                                                                              ;

and as to lava, they who have beheld it issue, as I did in 1858, from the

south-western flanks of Yesuvius, with a sm-face white and glowing like

that of the sun, and who have felt the scorching heat which it radiates, will

form a high conception of the intense temperature of the same lava at the

bottom of a vertical column several miles high, and communicating with a

great reservoir of fused matter, which, if it were to begin at once to cool

down, and were never to receive future accessions of heat, might require a

whole geological period before it solidified. Of such slow refrigeration hot

springs may be among the most effective instruments, abstracting slowly
                                                                     --

from tlic subterranean molten mass that heat which clouds of vapour are

seen to carry off in a latent form from a volcanic crater during an eruption,

or from a lava-stream dimng its solidification. It is more than forty years

since Mr. Scrope, in his work on volcanos, insisted on the important part
whicli water plays in an eruption, when intimately mixed up with the com-

ponent materials of lava, aiding, as he supposed, in giving mobility to the

more solid materials of the fluid mass. But when advocating this igneo-

aqueous theory, ho never dreamt of impugning the Huttonian doctrine as to

the intensity of heat which the production of the unstratified rocks, those

of the plutonic class especially, implies.

   The exact nature of the chemical changes which hydrothcrmal action may

effect in the earth's interior will long remain obscure to us, because the

regions where they take place are inaccessible to man ; but the manner in

which volcanos have shifted their position throughout a vast series of geolo-

--gical epochs becoming extinct in one region and breaking out in another

may, perhaps, explain the increase of heat as we descend towards the interior,

without the necessity of our appealing to an original central heat or the

igneous fluidity of the earth's nucleus.

   I hinted, at the beginning of this Address, that the hot springs of Bath

--may be of no high antiquity, geologically speaking, not that I can establish

this opinion by any positive proofs, but I infer it from the mighty changes
which this region has undergone since tlie time when the British seas,

rivers, and lakes were inhabited by the existing species of Testacea. It is

already more than a quarter of a century since Sir Eoderick Murchison

first spoke of the Malvern Straits, meaning thereby a channel of the sea

which once separated Wales from England. That such marine straits really

extended, at a modern period, between what are now the estuaries of the

Severn and the Dee has been lately confirmed in a satisfactory manner by

the discovery of marine shells of recent species in drift covering the water-

shed which di%'ides those estuaries. At the time when these shells were

living, the Cotswold Hills, at the foot of which this city is built, formed one

of the numerous islands of an archipelago into which England, Ireland,

and Scotland were then divided. The amount of vertical movement which
would be necessary to restore such a state of the surface as prevailed when

the position of land and sea were so different would be very great.

Nowhere in the world, according to oiu- present information, is the

evidence of upheaval, as manifested by upraised marine shells, so striking as

in "Wales. In that country ilr. Trimmer first pointed out, in 1831, the

occurrence of fossil shells in stratified drift, at the top of a hill called Moel

Tryfacn, near the Menai Straits, and not far from the base of Snowdon.

I visited the spot last year, in company with my friend Mr. Symonds, and we

collected there not a few of the marine Testacea. Mr. Darbishire has obtained

from the same drift no less than fiftj'-four fossil species, all of them now

living either in high northern or British seas, and eleven of them being

exclusively arctic. The whole fauna bears testimony to a climate colder
than that now experienced in these latitudes, though not to such extreme

cold as that implied by the fauna of some of the glacial drift of Scotland.

The shells alluded to were procm-ed at the extraordinary licight of 1360 feet

above the sea-level, and they demonstrate an upheaval of the bed of the sea

Ato that amount in the time of the living Testacea.  considerable part of

what is called the glacial epoch had already elapsed before the shelly strata

in question were deposited on Moel Tryfaen, as we may infer from the

polished and striated siu-faces of rocks on which the drift rests, and the occur-
IXx REPORT 1864.

ronce of erratic blocks smoothed and scratched, at the bottom of the same

drift.

   The evidence of a period of great cold in England and Iforth America, in
the times referred to, is now so universally admitted by geologists, that I

shall take it for granted in this Address, and briefly consider what may have

been the probable causes of the refrigeration of central Europe at the era in
question. One of these causes, first suggested eleven years ago by a celebrated
Swiss geologist, has not, I think, received the attention which it well deserved.

When I proposed, in 183.3, the theory that alterations in physical geography

might have given rise to those revolutions in climate which the earth's surface

has experienced at successive epochs, it was objected by many that the signs

of upheaval and depression were too local to account for such general changes

of temperature. This objection was thought to be of peculiar weight when

applied to the glacial period, because of the shortness of the time, geologically

speaking, which has since transpired. But the more we examine the monu-

ments of the ages which preceded the historical, the more decided become the
proofs of a general alteration in the position, depth, and height of seas, con-
tinents, and mountain -chains since the commencement of the glacial period.

The meteorologist also has been learning of late years that the quantity of ice
and snow in certain latitudes depends not merely on the height of mountain-
chains, but also on the distribution of the surrounding sea and land even to

considerable distances.

   M. Escher von der Linth gave it as his opinion in 1852, that if it were
true, as Ritter had suggested, that the groat African desert, or Sahara, was
submerged within the modern or jiost-tertiary period, that same submergence

might explain ^why the Alpine glaciers had attained so recently those colossal
dimensions which, reasoning on geological data, Venetz and Charpentier had

assigned to them. Since Escher fh'st threw out this hint, the fact that the
Sahara was reaUy covered by the sea at no distant period has been confirmed

by many new proofs. The distinguished Swiss geologist himself has just

returned from an exploring expedition through the eastern part of the

Algerian desert, in which he was accompanied by M. Desor, of Neuchatel,

and Professor Martins, of Mont]^)eUier. These three experienced observers

satisfied themselves, during the last winter, that the Sahara was under water

Wediuing the period of the living species of Testacea.  had already learnt in

1856, from a memoir by M. Charles Laurent, that sands identical with those

of the nearest shores of the Mediterranean, and containing, among other

recent shells, the common cockle {Cardium edule), extend over a vast space

from west to east in the desert, being not only found on the surface, but
also brought .up from depths of more than 20 feet by the Artesian auger.
These shells have been met with at heights of more than 900 feet above the
sea-level, and on ground sunk 300 feet below it; for there are in Africa, as
in Western Asia, depressions of land below the level of the sea. The same
cockle has been observed still living in several salt-lakes in the Sahara ; and

superficial incrustations of salt in many places seem to point to the drying

\\]) by evaporation of several inland seas in certain districts.

   Mr. Tristram, in his travels in 1859, traced for many miles along the

southern borders of the French possessions in Africa lines of inland sea-

cliffs, with caves at their bases, and old sea-beaches forming successive
terraces, in which recent shells and the casts of them were agglutinated
together with sand and pebbles, the whole having the form of a conglomerate.

The ancient sea appears once to have stretched frorCi the GuK of Cabes, in

several hundred (perhaps where greatest, according to Mr. Tristram, 800)
miles. The high lands of Barbary, including Morocco, Algeria, and Tunis,
must have been separated at this period from the rest of Africa by a sea. All

that we have learnt from zoologists and botanists in regard to the present fauna
and flora of Barbary favours this hypothesis, and seems at the same time

to point to a former connexion of that country with Spain, Sicily, and South

Italy.

   ^Tien speculating on these changes, we may call to mind that certain
deposits, full of marine shells of living species, have long been known as
fringing the borders of the Red Sea, and rising several huudi-ed feet above its

shores. Evidence has also been obtained that Egypt, placed between the

Eed Sea and the Sahara, participated in these great continental movements.
This may be inferred from the old river-terraces, lately described by Messrs.
Adams and Murie, which skirt the modern alluvial plains of the Nile, and rise
above them to various heights, from 30 to 100 feet and upwards. In what-
ever direction, therefore, we look, we see grounds for assuming that a map
of Africa in the glacial period would no more resemble our present maps of
that continent than Europe now resembles North America. If, then, argues
Escher, the Sahara was a sea in post-tertiary times, we may understand why
the Alpine glaciers formerly attained such gigantic dimensions, and why they

have left moraines of such magnitude on the plains of northern Italy and the

lower country of Switzerland. The Swiss peasants have a saying, when they

talk of the melting of the snow, that the sun could do nothing without the

Eohn, a name which they give to the well-known sirocco. This wind, after

sweeping over a wide expanse of parched and burning sand in Africa, blows
 occasionally for days in succession across the Mediterranean, carrying with it
the scorching heat"of the Sahara to melt the snows of the Apennines and

 Alps.

    M. Denzler, in a memoir on this subject, observes that the Fohn blew
 tempestuously at Algiers on the 17th of July 1841, and then crossing the
 Mediterranean, reached Marseilles in six hours. In five more hours it was

 at Geneva and the Valais, throwing down a large extent of forest in the
 latter district, while in the cantons of Zurich and the Grisons it suddenly
 turned the leaves of many trees from green to yeUow. In a few hours new-

 mown grass was dried and ready for the haystack ; for although in passing

 over the Alpine snows, the sirocco absorbs much moisture, it is stUl far

 below the point of saturation when it reaches the sub-Alpine country to the

 north of the great chain. MM. Escher and Denzler have both of them

 observed on different occasions that a thickness of one foot of snow has dis-

 appeared in four hours during the prevalence of this wind. No wonder,
 therefore, that the Eohn is much dreaded for the sudden inundations which

 it sometimes causes. The snow-line of the Alps was seen by Mr. Irscher,

 the astronomer, from his observatory at Neuchatel, by aid of the telescope,
 to rise sensibly every day wlule this wind was blowing. Its influence is^ by

 no means confined to the summer season, for in the winter of 1852 it visited
 Zurich at Christmas, and in a few days all the suiTounding country was

 stripped of its snow, even in the shadiest places and on the crests of high
 ridges. I feel the better able to appreciate the power of this wind from

 having myself witnessed in Sicily, in 1828, its effect in dissolving, in the

 month of November, the snows which then covered the summit and higher

 parts of Mount Etna. I had been told that I should be unable to ascend to

 the top of the highest cone tiU the following spring ; but in thirty-six hours

 the hot breath of the sirocco stripped off from the mountain its white mantle

  of snow, and I ascended without difficulty.
                                                                           ;!

Ixxii  --REPORT 1861'.

It is well known that the number of days during which particular winds

prevail, from year to year, varies considerabl}'. Between the years 1812 and

1820 the Fohn was less felt in Switzerland than usual; and what was the

consequence? All the glaciers, during those eight or nine years, iacreased in

height, and crept down bolow their former limits in their respective valleys.

Many similar examples might be cited of the seasitiveness of the ice to slight

variations of temperature. Captain Godwin-Austen has lately given us a

description of the gigantic glaciers of the western Himalaya in those vallej-s

where the sources of the Indus rise, between the latitudes 35° and 3G° N.

The highest peaks of the Karakorum range attain in that region an elevation

of 28,000 feet above the sea. The glaciers, says Captain Austen, have been

advancing, within the memory of the living inhabitants, so as greatly to

encroach on the cultivated lands, and have so altered the climate of the

adjoining valleys immediately below, that only one crop a year can now be

reaped from fields which formerly yielded two crops. If such changes can

be experienced in less than a century, without any perceptible modification

in the physical geography of that part of Asia, what mighty effects may we

not imagine the submergence of the Sahara to have produced in adding to

the size of the Alpine glaciers ? If, between the years 1812 and 1820, a mere

diminution of the number of days during which the sirocco blew could so

miich promote the growth and onward movement of the ice, how much

mndgreater a change would result fi-om the total cessation of the same

But this would give no idea of what must have happened in the glacial

period ; for we cannot suppose the action of the south wind to have been sus-
pended: it was not in abeyance, but its character was entirely different, and

of an opposite nature, under the altered geographical conditions above con-

templated. First, instead of passing over a parched and scorching desert,

between the twentieth and thii-ty-fifth parallels of latitude, it woidd plenti-

fully absorb moisture from a sea many hundreds of miles wide. K^ext, in its

course over the Mediterranean, it would take up still more aqueous vapour

and when, after complete saturation, it struck the Alps, it would be diivcn

up into the higher and more rarefied regions of the atmosphere. There the

aerial current, as fast as it was cooled, would discharge its aqueous burden

in the form of snow, so that the same wind which is now called " the

devoiu'er of ice " would become its ])rincipal feeder.

If we thus embrace Escher's theory, as accounting in no small degree for

the vast size of the extinct glaciers of Switzerland and Northern Italy, we

are by no means debarred from accc2)ting at the same time Charpentier's

suggestion, that the Alps in the glacial period were 2000 or 3000 feet higher

than they are now. Such a difference in altitude may have been an auxiliary

cause of the extreme cold, and seems the more probable now that we have

obtained unequivocal proofs of such great oscillations of level in Wales within

Wethe period under consideration.  may also avail ourselves of another

source of refrigeration which may have coincided in time with the submer-

gence of the Sahara, namelj', the diversion of the Gulf-stream from its j^resent

course. The shape of Europe and North America, or the boundaries of sea

and land, depai-ted so widely in the glacial j^eriod from those now established,

that we cannot suppose the Gulf-stream to have taken at that period its

l^resent north-eastern course across the Atlantic. If it took some other

direction, the climate of the north of Scotland would, according to the calcu-

lations of ilr. Hopkins, suiter a diminution in its average annual temperature

liilion in climate as might go far to account for the excessive cold which was
(lc^'eloped at so modern a period in the earth's history. But even when we
assume all three of them to have been simultaneouslj- in action, we have by
no means exhausted all the resources which a difference in the geographical
condition of the globe might supply. Thus, for example, to name only one of
them, we might suppose that the height and quantity of land near the north
pole was greater at the era in qiiestion than it is now.

   The vast mechanical force that ice exerted in the glacial period has been
thought by some to demonstrate a want of imiformity in the amount of

energy which the same natural cause may put forth at two successive epochs.
But we must be careful, when thus reasoning, to bear in mind that the power

of ice is here substituted for that of running water. The one becomes a
mighty agent in transporting huge erratics, and in scoring, abrading, and
polishing rocks ; but meanwhile the other is in abeyance. When, for example,
the ancient lihone glacier conveyed its moraines from the upper to the lower
end of the Lake of Geneva, there was no great river, as there now is, forming
a delta many miles in extent, and several hundred feet in depth, at the

iipper end of the lake.

    The more we study and comprehend the geographical changes of the glacial

period, and the migrations of animals and plants to which it gave rise, the

 higher our conceptions are raised of the duration of that subdivision of time,

 which, though vast when measm-ed by the succession of events comjirised in it,
was brief, if estimated by the ordinary rules of geological classification. The
glacial period was, in fact, a mere episode in one of the great epochs of the

earth's history ; for the inhabitants of the lands and seas, before and after the

grand development of snow and ice, were nearly the same. As yet we have no
satisfactory proof that man existed in Europe or elsewhere during the period

of extreme cold ; but our investigations on this head are still in their infancy.

In an early portion of the postglacial period it has been ascertained that man

flourished in Europe ; and in tracing the signs of his existence, from the
historical ages to those immediately antecedent, and so backward into more

ancient times, we gradually approach a dissimilar geographical state of
things, when the climate was colder, and when the configuration of the
surface departed considerably from that which now prevails.

    Archaeologists are satisfied that in central Eiirope the age of bronze weapons

preceded the Roman invasion of Switzerland ; and prior to the Swiss-lake

dwellings of the bronze age were those in which stone weapons alone were
used. The Danish kitchen-middens seem to have been of about the same
date ; but what M. Lartet has called the reindeer period of the South of
France was probably anterior, and connected with a somewhat colder climate.
Of still higher antiquity was that age of inider implements of stone such as were
buried in the fluviatile drift of Amiens and Abbeville, and which were mingled
in the same gravel with the bones of extinct quadrupeds, such as the elephant,
rhinoceros, bear, tiger, and hyaena. Between the present era and that of
those earliest vestiges yet discovered of our race, valleys have been deepened
 and widened, the course of subterranean rivers which once flowed through

caverns has been changed, and many species of wild quadrupeds have dis-

 appeared. The bed of the sea, moreover, has in the same ages been lifted up,
in many places hundreds of feet, above its former level, and the outlines of

many a coast entirely altered.

   MM. de Yerneuil and Louis Lartet have recently found, near Madrid, fossil

 teeth of the African elephant, in old valley-drift, containing flint imijlements

 of the same antique type as those of Amiens and Abbeville. Proof of the

same elephant having inhabited Sicily in the Postpliocene and probably

within the Human period had previously been brought to light by Baron
WeAnca, dming his exploration of the bone-caves of Palermo.
                                                                   have

now, therefore, evidence of man having co-existed in Europe vrith three
species of elephant, two of them extinct (namely, the mammoth and the

Elephas antiquus), and a third the same as that which still survives in

-- --Africa. As to the first of these the mammoth I am aware that some

writers contend that it could not have died out many tens of thousands

of years before our time, because its flesh has been found preserved ia
ice, in Siberia, in so fresh a state as to serve as food for dogs, bears, and

wolves ; but this argument seems to me fallacious. Middendorf, in 1843,
after digging through some tliickness of frozen soil in Siberia, came down
upon an icy mass, in which the carcase of a mammoth was imbedded, so

perfect that, among other parts, the pupil of its eye was taken out, and is
now preserved in the Museuiu of ^Moscow. Xo one will deny that this
elephant had lain for several thousand years in its icy envelope ; and if it had

been left undisturbed, and the cold had gone on increasing, for myriads of

centuries, we might reasonably expect that the frozen flesh might contiuue

undecayed until a second glacial period had passed away.

When speciilations on the long series of events which occurred in the glacial

and postglacial periods are indulged iu, the imagination is apt to take alarm
at the immensity of the time required to interpret the monuments of these

ages, all referable to the era of existing species. In order to abridge the

number of centuries which would otherwise be indispensable, a disposition

is shown by many to magnify the rate of change in prehistoric times, by

investing the causes which have modified the animate and inanimate world

witli extraordinary and excessive energy. It is related of a great Irish orator

of our day, that when he was about to contribute somewhat parsimoniously
towards a public charity, he was persuaded by a friend to make a more liberal

donation. In doing so he apologized for his first apparent want of generosity,

by saying that his early hfe had been a constant struggle ivith scanty means,

and that " they who are born to afiluence cannot easily imagine how long a

time it takes to get the chill of poverty out of one's bones." In like manner,

we of the living generation, when called upon to make grants of thousands of
centuries in order to explain the events of what is called the modem

period, shrink natui-ally at fii'st from making what seems so lavish an
expenditure of past time. Throughout our early education we have been

accustomed to such strict economy in all that relates to the chronology of the

earth and its inhabitants in remote ages, so fettered have we been by old
traditional beliefs, that even when our reason is convinced, and we are per-
suaded that we ought to make more liberal grants of time to the geologist, we

feel how hard it is to get the chill of poverty out of our bones.

I wiU now briefly allude, in conclusion, to two points on which a gradual

change of opinion has been taking place among geologists of late years. First,

as to whether there has been a continuous succession of events in the organic

and inorganic worlds, uninterrupted by violent and general catastrophes ; and

secondly, whether clear e\-idence can be obtained of a period antecedent to the

creation of organic beings on the earth. I am old enough to remember when

geologists dogmatized on both these questions in a manner very different from

that in which they would now venture to indulge. I beUeve that by far the

greater number now inchne to opposite views from those which were once

most commonly entertained. On the first point it is worthy of remark that

although a belief in sudden and general convulsions has been losing ground,
                   ADDRESS.                                          IXXV

as also the doctrine of abrupt transitions from one set of species of animals

and plants to another of a very diiferent type, yet the whole series of the

records which have been handed down to us are now more than ever regarded

as fragmentary. They ought to be looked upon as more perfect, because

numerous gaps have been filled up, and in the formations newly intercalated

in the series we have foimd many missing Unks and various intermediate

gradations between the nearest allied forms previously known in the animal
and vegetable worlds. Yet the whole body of monuments which we arc

endeavouring to decipher appears more defective than before. Tor my own

part, I agree with Mr. Darwin in considering them as a mere fraction of

those which have once existed, while no approach to a perfect series was

ever formed originally, it having never been part of the plan of Nature to

leave a complete record of all her works and operations for the enlightenment

of rational beings who might study them in after- ages.

In reference to the other great question, or the earliest date of vital

phenomena on this planet, the late discoveries in Canada have at least demon-

strated that certain theories founded in Europe on mere negative evidence

were altogether delusive. In the course of a geological survey, carried

on under the able direction of Sir WiUiam E. Logan, it has been shown that

northward of the river St. Lawrence there is a vast series of stratified and

crystalline rocks of gneiss, mica-schist, quartzite, and hmestone, about

40,000 feet in thickness, which have been called Laiirentian. They are more

ancient than the oldest fossihferous strata of Europe, or those to which the

term primordial had been rashly assigned. In the first place, the newest part

of this great crystalline series is unconformable to the ancient fossiliferous

or so-caUed primordial rocks which overlie it ; so that it must have undergone

disturbing movements before the latter or primordial set were formed. Then

again, the older half of the Laurentian series is unconformable to the newer

portion of the same. It is in this lowest and most ancient system of crystal-

line strata that a limestone, about a thousand feet thick, has been observed,

containing organic remarus. These fossils have been examined by Dr.

Dawson, of Montreal, and he has detected in them, by aid of the micro-

scope, the distinct structure of a large species of Rhizopod. Fine specimens

of this fossil, called Eozoon Caiutdense, have been brought to 15ath by Sir

WeWilliam Logan, to be exhibited to the members of the Association.  have

every reason to suppose that the rocks in which these animal remains are

included are of as old a date as any of the formations named azoic in Europe,

if not older, so that they preceded in date rocks once supposed to have been

formed before any organic beings had been created.

   But I wiU not venture on speculations respecting " the signs of a begin-

--ning," or " the prospects of an end," of our terrestrial system that wide

ocean of scientific conjecture on which so many theorists before my time have

suffered shipwreck. Without trespassing longer on your time, I will conclude

by expressing to you my thanks for the honour you have done me in asking

me to preside over this Meeting. I have every reason to hope, from the
many members and distinguished strangers whom I already see assembled

here, that it will not be inferior in interest to any of the gatherings which

have preceded it.

Report on Observations of Luminous Meteors, 1 863-Gl'. By a Committee,

   consisting of James Glaishek, F.R.S., of the Royal Observatory,

    Greenivich, Secretary to the British Meteorological Society, ^c.

   Robert P. Greg, F.G.S., S^-c. ; E. W. Bkayley, F.R.S., ^c. ; and

   Alexander S. Herschel,·^} B.A.

In presenting this Eeport, the Committee have the satisfaction to point out
among the observations of luminous meteors contributed by Members of the
Association and by others during the past year, an unusual number of the
larger class, or fireballs. The largest of these, seen upon the 5th of December,
1863, produced the vivid impression of lightning over the whole area of the
British isles. The magnitudes of three fireballs seen at Paris on the 6th
of June, and 6th and 9th of August 1864, are therefore greatly underrated,
because the fii-st of these, recorded of the fii'st class, is rated only six times
brighter than Yenus. The light of full-moon is, on the contrary, at least
1300 times greater than the light of Venus.

   Many of the observations in the present Catalogue refer particularly to the

radiant-points of meteors. This inquiry should be promoted with the aid of

maps especially provided for the pm-pose. Essential service may be rendered

by obsei-vations recorded ui^on maps, because these accumulate from year to
year until the observations appeal together to the eye, more correctly than a
meteoric shower would do observed without their aid.

   Radiant-points were determined on the 30th November, 12th December
(1863), and on the 2nd January, 10th, 13th, and 20th April (1864), with plane
perspective maps, which it is feared would otherwise have escaped attention.
The number of radiant- points that yet remain to be determined appears to be
strictly measured by the zeal of the observers. Mr. R. P. Greg indicates be-
tween twenty and thirty radiant-points as giving rise to the greater propor-
tion of shooting-stai's observed throughout the year (see Appendix), and

Professor Heis, of Miinster, has supplied a similar list for the use of observers,

in the Monthly Notices of the Astronomical Society*. That a radiant-point

 should not, "before the present Eeport, have been assigned to the meteors of
the 10th of April, appears the more remarkahle, as this date was noticed in
his Catalogue of fireballs by Baumhauer in 1845, and by Wolf in 1856 ; and

astronomers have been aware for more than thirty years, that when meteors

are periodical, they invariably take their directions from a fixed perspective

       vember display of meteors in 1866 (see Appendix), makes it desirable that

       astronomers should note the radiant-points of shootiag-stars, in order that,
       if any exists (from distant latitudes and longitudes), the parallax should be

       detected, and meteors may thus be referred to their true causes.

  A shooting-star of long flight, leaving a long train ; observed at Ports-

mouth and Hawkhurst (see Catalogue). Path, 142 miles in 2-8 seconds.
Velocity, forty-nine miles per second. Du-ection, from azimuth "W. from S.
264°, altitude 30°. Uegan 141 miles above the north of France (N. lat.

50° 20', long. 3° 3' E.) ; disappeared seventy-one miles above the English
Channel (N. lat. 50° 9', long. 0° 15' W.).

                       (2.) Fireball ; 1863, August 10th, 8'^ 30" p.m.

   Described by Dr. Bianconi (Report for 1863, pp. 274, 335), and observed
at Venice by Herr v. Wiillerstorf (Proc. Vienna Acad. vol. xlviii., 8th Oct.
1863). The streaks extended from near Corona to the stars of Scorpius.
Although, from the motion of the streak, the meteor appeared to be in the
region of the winds, the two observations, with a base hue of eighty-hve mUes
from Venice to the Sumoggia, indicate a considerable elevation. The first
appearance took place at a height of sixty miles, in lat. 45° 18' N., long.
11° 22' E., between Padua and Mantua. The meteor disappeared at a height
of twenty miles, between Parma and Carrara, in lat. 44° 25' N., long.
10° 12' E. Path, eighty miles. Direction, from the weU-known radiant-
point between Perseus and Cassiopeia.

                (9.) Fireball; 1863, December 27th, 6" 55" p.m.

   Observations, at East Harptree and at Dulverton in Somersetshire (see
Catalogue), agree with a path of eighty miles in 4 seconds. Direction, from

azimuth W. from S. 277°, altitude 45°. Began eighty miles above the

Channel (N. lat. 50° 37', long. 0° 42' W.) ; disappeared twenty-five miles
above Poole, in Dorsetshire (N. lat. 50° 43', long. 2° 0' W.). The fireball
agrees with an aerolitic date.

   South of the Cornish coast ; observed at Weston-super-Mare and Dul-
verton, in Somersetshire (see Catalogue). The overcast state of the sky
appears to have precluded more general observations.

                          (14.) EirebaU ; 1864, July 4th, 10'> 0"' p.m.

   Observed at Llanrwst (N. Wales) and at Wolverhampton, by Mr. T. M.
Simkiss (see Catalog-ue), who concludes the path to have been from fifty miles
above Stafford to thirty miles above Llandovery (in Wales). The meteor
observed through clouds at Greemvich (see Catalogue) is perhaps identical

with this.

                      (15.) EirebaU; 1864, August 6th, 10" 20"" p.m.

   Observed at Wrotham (Kent) and at Paris (see Catalogue). It also
attracted attention in Germany. Erom observations at Miinster, Essen, and
Kempen, Professor Hcis concludes its path to have been directed from a
considerable height above the North Sea, north-west of HoUand, to thii-ty or

thii-ty-five miles above the sea, due north of Holland. It feU with a steep
incKue from S.W. towards N.E.

   The annual display was less abundant than in 1863, and the meteors of
the 9th and 10th of August did not exceed the ordinary scale of the phe-
nomenon, either in numbers, brilliancy, or uniformity of direction. One
meteor only was simultaneously observed at Greenwich Observatory and at
Hawkhurst.

IV. ' N'ovEMBER Star-showers,' by Professor Newton.

(Am. Journ. Sci. vol. xxxvii. p. 377, and vol. xxxviii. p. 53.)

Comparing together the dates of thirteen historic star-showers, from Oc-

tober 13th, 902, to November 13th, 1833, the existence of a common meteoric

shotver becomes apparent. The node of the ring has an annual ^»-o-cession of

l'-711 (reckoned from mean equinox), or of 52"-56 reckoned from a fixed

equinox along the ecliptic. By this amount the date of the return has been

delayed one day in every 34 years since the first appearance of the shower

and the narratives are in accordance with a single meteoric phenomenon, of

which the yearly period is 365-271 days, returning with especial intensity

Afour times in every 133 years.  want of punctuality of one, two, or even

three years in the return of the display may be accounted for by the revo-

lution of the earth on its axis, by which observers were deprived of a view

of the spectacle during a part of its existence. The explanation of the

periodicity depends, not iipon the perturbations of the eartli or of the ring,

but upon the true periodical time of revolution of the cloud. Its displace-

ment yI^ parts of a revolution from the node per annum may be accom-

panied with 0, 1, or 2 complete revolutions round the sun, but with no frac-

tional i^art of a revolution, because the cloud has been encountered at the

node with almost equal intensity on two successive years (1832 and 1833).

The displacement cannot be accompanied vrith any greater intee/ral number

of revolutions than two, on account of its distance from the sun. As, more-

over, the true motion of the November meteors is sensibly perpendicular to

a radius-vector from the sun, probability must be held to decide in favour

of the nearly circular orbit, with li-j-fi? revolution per annum, and with a
velocity nearly equal to that of the earth, but in a retrograde direction. The

inclination observed corresponds to nearly 17° with the echptic.

   Should more than one revolution be performed in one year by the meteoric
cloud, the two or three successive encounters which compose one principal
meteoric epoch must fall earlier in the year, and vice versa. Sufficient mate-
                                                                              --

       A CATALOGUE OF OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS.       97

rials do in fact exist for preferring this alternative. In this case the period
from node to node is 354-621 days, with a probable error not exceeding
16 minutes. The orbit is nearly circular, with a semi-major axis 0-9805, a
velocity of arrival iu the atmosphere (allowing for the attraction of the earth)
20-17 miles, and a velocity of passage through the atmosphere 38-7 miles, or

nearly forty miles per second.

  A maximum display on the morning of the 14th November, 1866, is

expected to be chiefly visible on the western Atlantic.

17 inches into the ground. It is entirely covered by a thin black crust, and

    Dr. Haidinger, of Vienna, concludes a paper on the physical connexion of

--meteorites with fireballs and shooting-stars by the following remarks (vol. xlix.

p. 16) : " One of the conclusions which appear to be established by recent

observations is, that the three classes of meteorites, fireballs, and shooting-

Astars are assemblages of fragments, finer or coarser.  study of the fused

surfaces of the meteorites of Stannern shows that these, at least occasionally,

enter the atmosphere in a crowd. Dr. Schmidt observed a similar structure,
by aid of the telescope, in the case of a detonating fireball, on the 19th October,

1863. Mr. Alexander Herschel also arrives at the same conclusion, on in-
dependent grounds, vpith respect to shooting-stars, and supposes them to
consist of dust, more or less arenaceous in its form." The fireball observed
by Dr. Schmidt, the Researches on Metoerites, and those on Shooting-stars,

referred to in this paragraph, are described in former papers of the Academy.

       (3.) 1863, December 7th, 11'^ a.m.

ATourinnes la Grosse, Tirlemont, near "Waterloo in Flanders.  baU of

white-hot matter shot suddenly from S.E. to N.W. across the sky, which was

cloudy. Shortly afterwards a crash was heard, followed by a whistUng noise.

Two aerolites were precipitated, 14 lbs. and 15 lbs. in weight, and distant two

miles from one another, one of which broke the trunk of a fir-tree 12 inches

in circumference, and buried itself 6 inches in the earth. The second, falling

on a footway in the village of Tourinnes la Grosse, splintered a flagstone, and

broke into 25 or 30 fragments, severely burning the fingers of those who

Aattempted to collect them.  thii-d stone of 2| lbs. weight, which feU

without injury from branch to branch of a tree, is preserved in the Museum

of Natural History at Paris. Daubree and Haidinger conclude that meteorites

reach the earth -with a velocity less than that of a cannon-ball. The de-

tonations are a proof of the violence with which their planetary velocity is

destroyed by the resistance of the air. The Tourinnes stones are Ught grey,

and, from the presence of spherules, chondritic. Chladnite (nickeliferous

iron) and troilite (magnetic iron-pyrites) are disseminated through the stones

    Showers of meteors are of comparatively frequent occurrence, and, since the
display of November 1833, it is well kuo'mi that the meteoric tracks on these
occasions take their directions fi-om a point (termed the radiant- jioint of the

shower) which retains its apparent place imchanged among the stars during
the continuance of the shower. The following observations were expressly
condiicted for the purpose of determining the radiant-points of meteors on

particular dates, since the last Eeport :

hour and place, is a strong aVgument for the astronomical uatiu'e of periodical

Ameteors.     radiant-point near a Lyra; was observed in America, by the

Clate E. Hen-ick, on the morning of the 19th April, 1839, a qiuirter of a

century before the observation recorded in this list. Eelying upon the gene-

ral stability of meteoric phenomena, it is possible to determine the radiant-
points of sjjoradic meteors (if these exist), in the same manner as the radiant-

points of periodical shooting-stars, from observations of a long series of years.

 The Eeports of the British Association, Coulvier Gravier's Catalogues, and
· other less extensive observations atford more than sufficient materials for the
 purpose. The centres of excursion of sjioradic meteors continue for weeks,

 or even months, in one position, until theii' epochs overlap. Two or more

centres of excursions then coexist for a time, and afterwards give place to

other radiant-points. The following list of general radiant-points of shootings

by the corresponding list of radiant-points contributed by Dr. Heis, in the
' Monthly Notices' of the Astronomical Society (vol. xxiv. p. 213).

tions are calculated to add to the precision -with which, it will in future be

desirable to fix the epochs and positions of these radiant-poiiits. When the

epochs and positions of the different general radiant-points of shooting-stars

are more exactly circumscribed, it may be reasonably expected that fireballs
and meteorites wiU be shown to belong, hke shooting- stars, to meteoric

showers.

   The results arrived at independently by Professor Heis, of Miinster, are in
general strongly corroborative of those obtained by Mr. Greg, of Manchester,
though in certain cases the latter exhibits radiants not given by the former,
and vice versa. Professor Heis, however, has somewhat arbitrarily divided
his meteor-showers and radiants into bi-monthly divisions, and has thus
occasionally presented the same shower with a number of radiants more or

less closely aUied to each other.

Mr. Greg has endeavoured to give as nearly as possible the precise dura-

tion and limit of each shower, as well as the average position of its connected

radiant.

   The general results may be thus summed up, with a tolerable degree of

certainty, as regards the meteor-sliowers.

They appear to endure for almost any period, from twenty-four hours to

eight or possibly ten weeks, differing from one another in richness or intensity

of display. In some there appears to be a tendency to maximum display

on particular days, as for example xlvii., lasting from November 26th to De-

cember 30th ; but the most abundant display occurs from December 9th to

13th. In others no such maximum can be perceived. Their number, of
fully fifty as yet ascertained, will probably not be much exceeded, unless

by short-lived showers, and by others whose radiants culminate just before

dawn. There is no confusion or chance in their return, but, on the contrary,

the showers arc very regularly reciu'rent every year, and, allowing a radiant-

region of 10° to 15° in diameter for each, the so-called " sporadic" meteors

wiU become extremely scarce, now that the principal showers and their

Aradiants have been pointed out.   well-marked instance of long persistence,

and remarkable for having its radiant very small and fixed, is the shower of
August 6th to September 10th, no. xxix. The great majority have, at the

present time, been as clearly defined (as regards the time of their occurrence,

duration, and positions of their radiants) as is the case with the older and

better-knowia showers of August and Ifovember, On the average of many

years, the radiant-regions of a few are, however, still very extensive. In all,

a plane, oval, or double-headed region of radiation appears to represent the
conditions of the showers more correctly than a point. This elongation of
the radiant-region is in most cases perpendicular to the ecliptic, or parallel

to the via lacfea, in or near which the greater number of the radiants in the
latter half of the year are placed. The meteors of particular showers vary

in their distinctive characters, some being larger and brighter than others,
some whiter, some more ruddy than others ; some swifter, and drawing after
them more persistent trains than those of other showers. Their connexion
with the epochs and directions of large meteors stUl remains to be esta-

blished.

   Frederick Purdy*.

Foe a uniformity of weights and measures with reference to the interests
of science, the Committee recommend to the British Association the follow-

ing resolutions :

    1, That it is desirable, in the interests of science, to adopt a decimal system
of Aveights and measures.

    2. That in furtherance of this proposal, it is desirable, from its scientific
capabilities, to adopt the metric system f.

    o. That as the weights and measures of this country are gradually under-
going a process of decimaUzation, it would be more advantageous, instead of
drifting by degrees into a heterogeneous variety of systems, to change at
once to a really convenient system.

    4. That it be recommended to the Government, in all cases in which
statistical documents issued by them relate to questions of international
interest, to give the metric equivalents to English weights and measures.

    5. That in communications respecting weights and measures, presented to
foreign countries wliich have adopted the metric sj'stem, equivalents in the
metric system be given for the ordinary English expressions for length,
capacity, bulk, and weight.

    6. That it be recommended to the authors of scientific communications, in
all cases where the expense or labour involved would not be too great, to
give the metric equivalents of the weights and measures mentioned.

    7. That the influence of the British Association would be beneficially
exerted in obtaining from Paris an authorized set of metric weights and
measures, to be placed in some pubhc and fre(iuented bi;ilding in London.

    8. That advantage will be derived from the recent publication of metric
tables, by C. H. Dowling, C.E., in which British standard weights and
measures are compared Avith those of the metric system J. That treatises
 explaining the metric system, with diagrams, should be forthwith laid before
the public. That works on arithmetic should contain metric tables of weights
 and measures, with suitable exercises on those tables ; and that inspectors of
 schools should examine candidates for pupil-teachers in the metric system.

    9. On the subject of temperature, it is recommended that the authors of

 Reports to be presented to the British Association, relative to temperature,

be requested to give the degrees of heat or cold according to both the
Centigrade and Fahrenheit's thermometers.

    10. It is recommended that the scales of thermometers constructed for sci-
entific purposes be divided both according to the Centigrade and Fahrenheit

scales ; and that barometric scales be divided into fractions of the metre, as
well as into those of the foot and inch.

    11. That a committee on uniformity of weights and measures be re-
appointed, with a grant of £20.

   Prince Talleyrand, in 1790, distributed among the members of the Consti-
tuent Assembly of France a proposal, founded upon the excessive diversity
and confusion of the weights aud measures then prevailing all over that

country, for the reformation of the system, or rather for the foundation of a

new system upon the principle of a single and universal standard*.

  A Committee of the Academy of Sciences, consisting of five of the most

--eminent mathematicians of Europe Borda, Lagrange, Laplace, Monge, and
--Condorcet were subse(]uently appointed, under a decree of the Constituent

Assembly, to report upon the selection of a natural standard ; and the Com-

mittee proposed in their Report that the ten-millionth part of the quarter of
the meridian of Dunkirk should be taken as the standard unit of linear

measure.
    Delambro and Mechain were appointed to measure an are of the meridian

between Dunkirk and Barcelona. They commenced their labours at the most
agitated period of the French revolution. At every station of their progress
in the field-survey they were arrested by the suspicions and alarms of the
people, who took them for spies or engineers of the invading enemies of
France. The result was a very wonderful approximation to the true length,
and one in the highest degree " creditable to the French astronomers and
geometricians, who carried on their operations, under every difficulty and at

the hazard of their lives, in the midst of the greatest political convulsion of
modern times" t.

   By means of the arc of the meridian measured between Dunkirk and Bar-
celona, and of the arc measiu-ed in Peru, in 1736, by Bougner and La Con-

damine, the length of the quarter of the meridian, or the distance from the pole
to the equator, was calculated. This length was partitioned into ten millions
of equal parts, and one of these parts was taken for the unit of length, and
called a metre X, from the Greek word nerpov {a measure).

    If the arc of the meridian be calculated from the result of French researches,
the metre itself is equal, in English measirrement, to 39-37079 inches ; and
m\xltiplying this length by 10,000,000, the length of the quadrant of the

meridlian, when converted into feet, will be, 32,808,992 feet. Sir John

 Herschel estimates the length of the quadrant of the meridian at 32,813,000
feet ; so that, according to his calculation, there is a diiference between the

French and the new estimate of the quadrant, of 4008 feet, and therefore the

French length of the quadrant is g-pVr^^ too short, aud the metre is ^J-^th
 of an inch less than the length of the ten-miUiouth part of the quadrant.

   An error of ^J^-th of an inch in the determination of the metre is

 more than counterbalanced by the extreme simplicity, symmetry, and con-

 venience of the metric system. Professor Bessol observed with respect to

 the metre, that, " in the measurement of a length hetween two points on
 the surface of the earth, there is no advantage at all in proving the relation
 of the measured distance to a quadi-ant of the meridian"*. Professor Miller,

of Cambridge, who quotes this remark, deems the error in the relation of the

 metre to the quadrant of the meridian to be of no consequence ; and he
 mentions another slight error in the metric system, discovered by recent
research, and relating to the density of water, which he gives in the following
words of Bessel t:

    " The kilogramme (1000 grammes) is not exactly the weight of a cubic

decimetre of water. Many of the late weighings show that water at its maxi-

mum density has a diiferent density from that which was assumed by the

Erench philosophers who prepared the original standard of the kilogramme
but nobody wishes to alter the value of the gramme on that account."

    M. Chevalier stated to the Committee of the House of Commons on Weights

and Measui'es, in 1862, that, in calcidation, the metric system spares both
time and labour, exactly as a good machine would do for spinning or
weaving.

    The metric system is considered by Sir William Armstrong to be " the only
one which has any chance of becoming universal."

   Two important principles form the basis of the metric system.

    1. That the unit of linear measure, applied to matter, in its three forms of
extension, viz. length, breadth, and thickness, should be the standard of all
measures of length, sui'face, and solidity.

    2. That the cubic contents of the linear measure, in distilled water, at a
temperature of great contraction, should furnish at once the standard weight
and measure of capacity.

   Scientific advisers were summoned to the counsels of King Louis Philippe,
on his accession to the French throne, and that monarch has the credit of
having enforced the metric system in France. The opposition to the metric
system, among the French, had not arisen from the requirements of com-
merce ; the Department of the Bridges and High Roads and the officials of
the naval arsenals had, with the consent of the French government, aheady
adopted the metric system, and the new system came into general operation

in 1840.

   The Department of Commerce in France superintends the proper observance
of weights and measures. Standards made for the course of trade are very

numerous.

   " If you have been walking about Paris," says M. ChevaHer, " you may
have seen the metre in the streets, fixed in the wall of many a pubhc build-
ing. It is made by public authority. Any buyer, who is afraid that he has

been cheated, can go to some street at a short distance, and there he finds the
measurement of the metre, fixed by authority for the use of the people : besides,

he has a process more simple, to know whether he has been dealt with fairly
he has his own metre in his pocket."

    Verifiers of weights and measures are appointed in every district (arron-

dissement) of France, and each verifier has his own set of these instruments.
Measures are made very cheap in Pai'is : balances furnished with smaU weights
may be purchased at a small expense ; and in the larger weights, the principal

expense is in the metal.

   Gutch's 'Literary and Scientific Eegister' for 1864* contains a useful
comparison of metric and English, measures, compiled by Mr. "Warren De
la Eue, F.R.S., in which the different quantities of the metric system are
expressed in their English equivalents, and the value of several important
English weights and measures is given in the terms of the metric system.

    Until comparative tables of the English and metric systems had been
published, the labour of converting English weights and measures into the

metric system was so excessive, that when communications to scientific

societies were published in England, with merely British weights and
measures, such papers were frequently not translated in foreign countries, and
the labours of the Englishman of science were consequently not appreciated
beyond the limits of Anglo-Saxon dominions.

   Practical inconvenience was felt, during the negotiation of the commereia
treaty between Erance and England, on accoiuit of the English inch not being
at that time usually divided, except into quarters and eighths.

   Mr. Ogilvie, Surveyor General of the Custom House in London, who assisted

Mr. Cobden in the Erench treaty, found the advantage of the minute subdi-
visions of Erench measui-es, such as the millimetre, which is one-third less than
one-sixteenth of an inch, and is the one-thousandth part of the metre.

   Erench workmen are familiar with the millimetre as a unit of width, and

as especially useful with reference to plates of iron or other materials. Duties
had to be calculated for the treaty on rolled iron, in cases where the work of
rolling increased the value of the iron, and where a slight diminution of width
was of great importance.

   The following diagram, from Glitch's ' Scientific Eegister,' wUl show the
minute subdivision of the millimetre, and will also exhibit the near approxi-
mation of 100 miUimetres to 4 inches.

if the metric system were to take the place of the existing tables of weights
and measures in England.

   The English workmen engaged in building-trades, such as cai-penters,
masons, and bricklayers, Professor Donaldson considers to be generally very
intelligent ; and whatever would afford to them facility in calculation would
be acceptable as soon as it had been explained to them.

   In railway operations a civU engineer ascertains weight by computation
of measure : he cannot take scales and beams, and weigh pieces of ii'on
of twenty tons and upwards ; he knows the specific gravity of the iron,
and he ascertains by measurement the weight of a given quantity of
that metal. The metric system aids in aU calculations relating to specific

gravity.

   Mr. W. Crosley, C.E., stated to the Committee of the House of Commons

on Weights and Measures that he believes the decimal system is extending
itself very much, especially for scientific purposes and amongst professional
men. " It is extending itself among them very considerably, without any
law whatever."

    Chemists, pursuing important researches, employ generally metric weights
and measures. Thus, in the Eoyal Institution of Great Britain, in Albemarle
Street, the operations of the laboratoiy arc carried on with the aid of the
metric system ; and Dr. Frankland, one of the chemists of that Society, finds
the metric weights and measures particularly valuable in his experimental
investigations respecting gases. The gramme, with its multiples and minute
subdivisions, is a popular weight with chemists.

   In the practical business of a di-uggist the metric system of weights and
measures, if generally adopted, would, in the opinion of Mr. Squire, save a
great deal of labour to the rising generation. In the metric system, Mr.
Squire observes, as the divisions and multiplications are all bytcn, the
subject and the calculations would bo much simplified *.

  A meeting, held in June 1863, of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great

Britain, adopted a petition to the House of Commons, in which they recom-
mended an assimilation of the weights and measures of all nations, as likely
" to tend greatly to the convenience of pharmaceutists f and the safety of

the public."

   The Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain felt assured that a " very few
years would famUiarize both prescribers and dispensers with the new
weights and measures, and that the easy multiplication or division of them

by the decimal system, universally applied, woiild afford such facilities of

computation as to recommend it strongly to the adoption of medical men

and chemists ; and they are strengthened in this opinion by the invariable
practice of English and all other analytical chemists already to state the

results of their investigations in decimals."

    Some metric measures and weights approach very nearly to corresponding
EngHsh quantities : thus, in liquid measure, five litres are nearly equal to

lyLj gallon, or 1 gallon 0-402 of a quart.

  A half-lvilogramme, or weight of 500 grammes, is equivalent to 1 lb. 1 oz.

10-191 drams avoirdupois.

   The following brief table, by Mr. Samuel Brown, condenses the systcou of

similar arrangement with regard to measures of length and measures of

capacity.

In HoUand the law requii-es the use of the metric system in aU things,

except weighing medicines. The old Dutch names, such as " elle " and

"palm," are preserved in the metric tables ; the "eUe" is the metre (3-2809

Afeet), and the "palm" the decimetre (or 3-937 inches).   "kan" in

Holland is the name for a litre, or 1-760 pint. In weights, the " ons " is

the Dutch name for a hectogramme*, or 3-527 ounces; and a "pond"

corresponds to the kilogramme (=2-205 lbs.).

In Spain the government has purchased 600 sets of metric weights and

measures, and it intends to buy more, so that it may supply each important

town with standards for comparison. On the Spanish railways, distances are

measured by kilometres, and weights by kilogrammes. Tables are published

containing the equivalents of the old Spanish weights and measiu'es in metric

quantities, and calciilated in each case from 1 to 1000.

Official tables are published in Portugal, containing Portuguese measure-

ments in metrical quantities, and vice versa. Inspectors of schools, appointed
by the general superintendents of weights and measures, have inspected 2720

pubhc and private schools, and schools are established under the same super-

Aintendence to explain the new system f. great number of elementary works

have been published in Portugal on metrical weights and measures for the use

of schools, as well as for the public.

   In the United States of America a committee has been appointed by Con-
gress to consider the subject of metric weights and measures. The Confede-

rate States of North America have also expressed a wish to introduce into

tlieir republic the metric system of weights and measures ; and the same

system has been adopted in Mexico, ChiU, Pertf, New Granada, Bolivia,

Venezuela, and French and Dutch Guiana.

   Mr. Samuel Brown, in his evidence, in 1862, before the Committee of the
House of Commons on AVeights and Measui-es, states, that in 1859, of the total

trade of Great Britain, including 79,405 vessels, there were 47,393 vessels

going to or from countries using the kilogramme, or about 60 per cent, of

the total niunber of vessels; and of 19,332,174 tons, there were 7,726,148

tons carried to or from countries using the kilogramme, or about 40 per cent,

of the total tonnage.

Postal arrangements between Great Britain and France are complicated by

the French weight for letters being somewhat heavier than the English foreign

weight.

   An English ounce weighs 28-349 grammes ; and the quarter of an ounce,

or English foreign weight, weighs 7-087 grammes.

In France the postal weight for single letters from England is 7-5

grammes; so that the French allow an excess of weight of -413 of a
gramme, or more than -i-rd of a gramme more than the English.

   If a letter be prepaid by stamps, the advance is 4cZ. in England for every
quarter of an ounce, and 40 centimes in France for every weight of 7| grammes.

   The postal treaty between the two countries declares that " no letter, of
which the postage is paid by stamps, is to be treated as an insufficiently paid

letter, unless the value of the stamps be less than the amount required for its
payment, according to the weight allowed, not only by the English, but by

the French scale of weight, of which 7|- grammes is the unit."
   In practice the postal officials in London weigh letters going to France, and

paid by stamps, with French weights. Sir Eowlaud Hill informed the House
of Commons Committee, that if the prepaid letter does not exceed the French
allowance, no additional charge is levied ; if it does exceed that allowance, it
is marked as insufficiently paid.

    Local letters in France are charged hy a scale similar to that of England.
It begins at 15 gTammes, then it advances to 30, then to 60, and then to 90
grammes, and so on.

   Ten grammes are equal to nearly ird of an ounce, 15 grammes are a little
more than g an ounce, an ounce being 28"349 grammes.

   The use of metric weights and measures has recently been legalized in
Great Britain ; and the Act on this subject has been passed in 1864, " for the
promotion and extension of our internal as well as our foreign trade, and for
the advancement of science."

    Mr. William Ewart, M.P., has ably conducted this measure through the

House of Commons ; Earl Fortescuc has had the successfid charge of it in the
House of Lords ; and the BILL has been also supported by the International
Decimal Association, in whose labours Mr. James Yates has taken an
active and leading part. The investigations of the Committee of the House
of Commons on Weights and Measiu'cs, in 1862, have assisted in forming

an influential parliamentaiy party in its favour.

   Various recommendations were made, in 1862, by the House of Commons
Committee, at the close of their Eeport, among which were the following :

    " That a Department of Weights and Measures be estabUshed in connexion
with the Board of Trade.

   " The metric system should form one of the subjects of examination in the

competitive examinations of the civil service.

   " The qramme should be used as a weight for foreign letters and books at

the Post Office.

   " The Committee of Council on Education should require the metric system

to be taught (as may easily be done, by means of tables and diagrams) in all

schools receiving grants of public money.
    " The Committee further suggest that, in the public statistics of the

country, quantities should be expressed in terms of the metric system, in
juxtaposition with those of our o'mi, as suggested by the International
Statistical Congress."

    It will be satisfactory to notice that, in a Beport in 1862, by Mr. J. Ball,
published by the British Association for the Advancement of Science,
" On Thermometric Observations in the Alps," the temperatures are given
according to the Centigrade scale, the corresponding temperatures according
to Falironhcit being frequently added in brackets.

    Sometimes the observations in this Beport merely record the fluctuations of
the mercury in the Centigrade thermometer.

    Observations vany, in like manner, be easily registered, both according to
the English and French scales of temperature, and the fluctuations of the

barometer may also be noted so as to be intelligible both in France and Great

Britain.

    At the end of Mr. Dowling's " Metric Tables," a comparison of the scales
of Fahrenheit's, the Centigrade, and Beaumur's thermometers is given, as
well as a comparison of the British and metric barometers, the latter con-
taining the equivalents, from 27 inches to 30*98 inches, in linear inches and

millimetres.

University of Loudon, candidates are frequently asked, among other ques-

lions, to convert a given number of degrees of Fahrenheit into the corre-

sponding degrees of a Reaumur or a Centigrade thermometer.

Sir William Armstrong remarked, at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, in his address

to the British Association in 1863, that our thermometric scale had been

originally founded in error : he regarded it as most inconvenient in division,

and advised that the Centigrade scale should be recognized by the numerous

men of science composing the British Association.

The distinguished President of the British Association stated his regret

that two standards of measure, so nearly alike as the English yard and the

WeFrench metre, should not be made absolutely identical.          in England,

observed Sir William, have no alternative biit to confonn with France, if we
desire general Uniformity. He was convinced that the adoption of the deci-

mal division of the French scale would be attended with great convenience,

both in science and commerce. He could speak, fi-om personal experience,

of the superiority of decimal measurement in all cases where acciu'acy is

required in mechanical constiiiction. In the Elswick works, as well as in

some other large establishmeuts of the same descri^jtion, the inch is adopted

as the unit, and aU fractional parts are expressed in decimals. " No diffi-

culty has been experienced in habituating the workmen to the use of this

method, and it has greatly contributed to the precision of workmanship.

The inch, however, is too small a unit, and it would be advantageous to

substitute the metre, if general concurrence could be obtained."

Report of Experiments respecting the Development and Migrations of

   the Entozoa. By T. Spencer Cobbold, M.D., F.R.S., F.L.S.,

Lecturer on Comparative Anatomy at the Middlesex Hospital.

At the Cambridge Meeting of this Association in 1862, I offered a brief
resume of the principal facts then known in relation to the origin and mode
of development of the Entozoa Uable to infest the human body ; but, not-

withstanding the very interesting discoveries which Contiaen'tal observers
had made on this subject, it stiU appeared that there was room for further
inquiry. In this view I proposed to institute a series of experiments, partly

for the pui'pose of verifying previously recorded statements, but more par-

ticularly with the intention of adding to our stock of hehninthological facts.

The General Committee, in approval, sanctioned and encouraged this pro-

position                           and  I  therefore proceed  to  explain the nature of the experiments
                                J

adopted. Though the results arrived at exhibit, for the most part, a nega-

tive aspect, yet in some instances the reverse of this is the case, whilst,

under any circumstances, the facts are calculated to prove more or less

instructive, and all of them tend to advance a department of science in the

progress of which our present and future social welfare is deeply concerned.

   I have not, indeed, limited my inquuics to particular human parasites,

but have employed all such helminthic forms as I have been able to procure

in a satisfactory condition for experiment. In this couutiy, and especially in

London, great difficulties are placed in the way of any one engaged in

biological pursuits involving the keeping of dogs and other animals ; and, last

year (1863), these obstructions were, I fear, somewhat enhanced by certain

misguided individuals who seem to entertain the idea that phj-'siologists

delight in the practice of cruelty. The destruction of game by the sports-

man, the capture of fish by the hook, and the slaughter of domestic animals
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

for food are attended with far more inconvenience and misery to the
creatures thus destroyed than obtains, in the majority of cases, where
animals are sacrificed on the altar of science ; for, in the latter case, not
only are the experimental animals generally destroyed suddenly, but, in
those instances where the act of life-departure is more prolonged, the
employment of anaesthetics is frequently made use of. Believing, however,
that it is not necessary to offer any further apology in favour of the experi-

mental methods commonly adopted in our biological inquiries, I now proceed
to notice the several species of Entozoa which have been made the subject

--of investigation.
   1. Tcenia ecJiinococcus. Of all the mischievous parasites known to infest
the human body, none are capable of producing such dire resiolts as those

affected by the larvae of this very minute tapeworm. I will merely add,
that it is not only the cause of the formidable Echinococcus-endemic in

Iceland, but that it also in this country destroys many persons annually.
   On the 30th September, 1862, I fed a house-dog with several hundred

Echinococcus-heads (scolices), obtained from the body of a youug person

who had been destroyed by this parasite. On the 28th of November of the

same year I killed the dog, but could discover no trace of the Tcenice to which
these larvae are believed to be referable.

   On the 14th January, 1863, I administered five small Echinococcus-

vesicles to a dog which ate them greedily. Similar administrations were
also made on the 2-J:th of the same month, and again on the 6th of February.
To the results likely to be obtained from these experiments I looked forward
with considerable interest ; but, on the evening previous to the day I had
appointed for the dog's destruction, some person liberated the animal.
Should the experiments in this case happen to have been successful, the
freedom of the dog could only serve to spread abroad the very formidable
disease which it is the object of these experiments to check. Those, there-

fore, who are hostile to our researches should bear in mind that interference
with our pursuits may be attended with results seriously affecting the welfare

of the community.

   On the 2nd of February, 1863, I fed another dog with several Echino-

coccus-vesicles taken from the lungs of a sheep ; and, on the 6th of the

same month, I repeated the dose with veiy fresh cysts. On the 25th

of February I also destroyed this dog, but found no examples of the cha-
racteristic Tcenio'. The animal would not have been destroyed thus early,
only I feared losing it altogether from the cause above mentioned.

   On the 6th of February, 1863, I gave about fifty Echinococcus-scolices to

a puppy. This animal was destroyed on the 10th of March, 1863; but, so
far as the Echinococci were concerned, the result was entirely negative.

   On the 28th of March, 1863, I administered to another dog scrapings

from the interior of a large Echinococcus-cyst, which, associated with several
other vesicles, had caused the death of a second person. The first patient
came under the medical care of Dr. Greenhow, while this case belonged to

Dr. Murchison. On the 9th of AprU following the animal was destroyed
but I had not succeeded in rearing the Tcenia ecJiinococcus. Had the para-

sites been present in this or any other of the dogs thus carefully examined, I

am confident they would not have escaped my notice, especially since the
possession of specimens of the adiilt tapeworm kindly sent me by Professor

--Leuckart, of Giessen, had rendered me familiar with its characters.
    2. Tcenia serrata. This well-known species infests the dog in its adult
 stage, the larvae being, beyond all dispute, the well-known pea-shaped
                                                                             ;

ox THE DEVELOPMENT AND MIGRATIONS OF THE ENTOZOA. 113

hydatids {Ciisticercus pisiformis) commonly found in rabbits. I offer the fol-

lowiiij? facts, therefore, partly in confirmation of previously ascertained results.

   On the 21st November, 1862, I administered to a dog one immature

Cysticercus-vesicle taken from the abdominal cavity of a rabbit ; and to the
same dog I also gave, on the 24th of the same month, four mature

examples of Ci/sticercus piisiformis taken from the mesentery of another

rabbit, one of the larvae being injured. On the 28th of November the dog
was destroyed; and the result gave three examples of immature Tcenia

serrata, each measuring about half an inch in length. Their size indicated

clearly whence they were derived, whilst the non-development of the

injui-ed Cysticercus, as weU as that of the imperfectly developed larva, is

mysufficiently accounted for, and accords with  previous experience.

On the 19th January, 1803, on the 6th of Pebruary, and again on the

23rd of the latter month, I administered several mature examples of 0.

pkifonnis to the dog, wliich was subsecpently liberated, without my being
able to ascertain the result of my worm-feedings.

On the 20th February, 1863, I gave to another dog eight immature larva)

taken from the abdomen of a rabbit ; and again, on the 6th of March suc-

ceeding, two mature larva) (C. pisiformis) were given to the same dog.

This animal was destroyed on the ISth of March, and the result was entirety

satisfactory. There were two examples of Taniia serrata, each aboiit four inches

in length, none of the migrating or immature larvte having continued their

development.

On the 27th May, four fresh Cysticerci from a rabbit were given to

another dog, which, on being destroyed on the 3rd of the following June,

was found to contain four examples of Tcenia serrata. In this instance, I

believe, only one of the Cysticerci had developed into its strobila-form, one

being about three inches in length : the others were upwards of a foot

long, and could not, I presume, be referable to the three other larvae. This

--experiment, therefore, was partially negative.
   3. Tcenia marginata. On the 5th November, 1862, I fed a monkey with

eggs of this worm ; but he swallowed only a very small portion of the

potato in which I had placed them. The destruction of the animal on the

--5th of February, 1863, only yielded a negative result.
   4. Tcenia cucumerina. On the 8rd November, 1862, I fed several cock-

roaches (Blcttta orientalis') with mature proglottides of Tcenia cucumerina.

Subsequent careful dissections of these insects, at various intervals, failed

to reveal the existence of Cysticerci within their tissues.

   On the 7th of November, 1863, and again on the 12th, I fed other Blattce

with proglottides and eggs, mixed vrith sugar, treacle, potatoes, and bread

but these administrations only gave negative results.

On the 2Uth January, 1864, I removed a proglottis of the so-caUed Tcenia

elliptica (in the act of migrating) from the external surface of the body of a

cat. I placed it on glass, and noticed that it discharged eggs during its

movements. The proglottis was subsequently broken up and mixed with

paste. Five or six Blattce were next captured ; and, on being brought in

contact with the food, they very soon devoured the paste and all the

enclosed fragments of the proglottis, including the eggs. Forty-two hours

afterwards I dissected one of the larger cocki'oaches, and found at least one

hundred tapeworm eggs in its stomach. Each egg contained a six-hooked

embryo. There were one or two empty shells ; but I did not succeed in

finding a free embryo. Here the experiment ended ; for the other Blattce

successfully made their escape a few days afterwards.

114 REPORT 1864.

  --5. Disfoma liepaticum. On the 6th of Januaiy, 1863, numerous eggs

from the uterine tubes of one dozen flukes were placed in a jar of fresh

water containiag living vegetable matter (Anacharis). An examination of

the contents of the glass, on the 16th of March, revealed the presence of

many empty egg-sheUs, and others with immature embryos in their interior.
On the 13th AprU following, aU the embryos had apparently escaped ; but

they were not found in the water. Possibly they had been devoured by

Entomostraca.

   On the 6th January, 1863, a quantity of flukes' eggs were administered

to a frog ; but a subsequent examination of the reptile, after death, only gave

a negative result.

   6. Ascaris osculata.-- On the 11th October, 1862, sections of two female
nematodes, taken from a seal, were given to a dog. The seal had recently

died, its stomach containiag upwards of 200 ascarides. 'None of the eggs in
these worms contaiaed embryos ; but the yelk was undergoing segmentation.

Subsequently, eggs of this parasite, containing embryos, were also given to

the same dog, and likewise, at a stUl later date, several free embryos. On

destroying the dog, November 28, 1862, no young nematodes could be

detected in its intestines.

   On the 31st October, 1862, numerous eggs containing embryos were given
to a dace (Lei(ciscvs rutUus) and to a goldfish (^Cyprinus anratus). On the
3rd November following, the dace was killed, without my finding any trace

of the ova ; but on the day following (Nov. 4) I destroyed the gold-carp,
and found in its intestinal canal numerous empty egg-shells of Ascaris

osculata. In the large tank, however, I sought in vain for these minute

embryos.

   On the 29th October, and on the 4th November, 1862, many eggs con-
taining embryos were administered to frogs. Two of these Batrachians were
subsequently examined (Nov. 10), without my finding either ova or embiyos

in their interior; but the water of the large glass vase which had imprisoned
the frogs was found to contain a number of empty egg-shells of Ascaris

osculata, as weU as numerous living embryos, apparently referable to

these ova.

   On the 4th November, 1862, eggs with embryos were given to several

freshwater fishes (gudgeon, carp, and dace) ; but the subsequent destruction
and examination of some of these fishes only yielded a negative result.

   On April 13th, 1863, several free embryos of A. osculata were adminis-
tered to a dog, which was after^vards destroyed on the 3rd of June. No

young ascarides, however, could be detected.

   On the 11th October, 1862, when I first procured the adult ascarides from

the seal, some of the ova were placed in a glass jar of fresh water containing

Chara, others in jars of salt water supplied with Zostera. On the 15th of

the same month, none of the ova appeared to have undergone any material

change. On the 29th (18 days) the majority of those placed in the fresh

water had developed into embryos within theii' shells, and not a few had
escaped free into the water. At the same date, however, the eggs placed
LU the salt water had made comparatively little progress. Their yelk-seg-
mentation had certainly advanced ; but no embryos could be seen. One

sohtary empty shell was found in the salt water ; but this may have resulted
from injury. On the 7th November, some of the free embryos in the fresh

water were found to display signs of growth, and one of them showed a

tolerably well-developed digestive apparatus. On the 2nd of the following
December, a largo number of the embryos in the fresh water had either
                                                                                                           .;

         ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND MIGRATIONS OF THE ENTOZOA. 115

perished or had been devoured by Entomostraca present in the jar ; others
were found at the bottom of the vessel inactive, stretched out, and apparently
dead. By this time (December 2nd, 1862), the development of the salt-

water ova had much more advanced ; the yelk had, in many instances,

become transformed into embryos more or less complete, and several of

the latter had quitted their shells. On the 13th of April these embryos

had acquired well-marked digestive organs, and I thought I could discern

the rudiments of an internal reproductive apparatus. They now exhibited
a condition corresponding with that which the freshwater embiyos had

obtained at so early a period as the 7th of November. In other words, the
freshwater embryos at one month (after immersion of the ova^ were as far
advanced as the salt-water embryos at six months. I do not attempt to

explain this ; I can only speak to the facts as they were presented. On the

16th of July, 1863, all the freshwater embryos had disappeared ; a few dead
ova, with dark granular contents, lay at the bottom of the jar ; and there
were a great number of empty shells, with parasitic algoids growing from
their outer surfaces. In the salt water, on the 23rd September, 1863, there

were stiU many eggs containing segmented yelks, and others -with fully formed

embryos, these being likewise associated with mmaerous free living embryos.

   On the 2.5th of April, 1864, I still found some embryos aUve in the salt

water ; but I could not discover any traces of the original eggs. The move-
ments of the young worms were tolerably free, the largest specimen
measuring about -^^ of an inch in length.

  A careful search, made on the 21st of July last, failed to reveal any

evidence of their existence ; but as it is quite possible that one or two may

stiU. be living, I have retained the contents of the jar for subsequent final
examination.

  --7. Ascaris marginata. On the 25th February, 1863, a quantity of eggs

were taken from the uterus of a full-grown female, and placed in fresh

water supplied vjii^i Anacharis. On the 16th of Jiily following, most of the

ova appeared to contain embryos, which were moving freely within their

shells ; but none were foimd to have escaped. On the 23rd September, 1863,

similar facts presented themselves ; and although I detected no free embryos,
there were, nevertheless, several empty egg-shells at the bottom of the
vessel. The same conditions were still observed on the 20th April, 1864

but when I last examined the water (July 21, 1864), one or two embryos

were found free.

 --8. Ascaris lumhricoides. On the 8th December, 1862, a large number of

ova were placed in a jar containing fresh water. By the 13th of March
many of them appeared to have reached an early stage of embryonic forma-

tion, and then to have perished.

 --9. Ascaris megalocephala On the 24th of April, 1863, several thousand

eggs, in some of which yelk-segmentation had commenced, were placed in

two jars containing fresh water and Anacharis. On the 17th of the follow-

ing July, a large proportion of the eggs were found to inclose well-developed

embryos ; but none were observed free. On the 23rd of September, not only

were there a quantity of empty shells in both vessels, but also a correspond-
ing number of free embryos, some of which appeared to have grown con-

siderably since quitting the egg.

   On the 18th of July, 1863, some of the immature eggs, as well as eggs
containing embryos, were placed in a small vessel containing pond-mud
(thin clay). On the 23rd September following, I found the mud to contain
many eggs still undergoing yelk-segmentation, others with immature em-

                                                                                      i2
IIG REPORT--18u 4.

bryos, sonic few empty shells, and several highly active embryos adhering-

by their finely pointed tails to the glass slide on which the mud was spread

out. The whole aspect and behaviour of these embryo nematodes differed
very markedly fi'om those of Ascaris osculata, and also from the young

Anguillulce. The digestive organs were well developed in several ; but at

least one specimen was dead and disintegrated internally. I could not

satisfy myself as to the existence of any rudiments of a reproductive

apparatus.

   On the 18th of July, 1863, I also placed some of the above advanced eggs
in muddy pond-water, to which I added some cowdung. This was also
examined on the 23rd September, when a few empty shells were seen, their

former occupants not being visible. Most of the eggs contained segmented

yelks and young embryos. On the 2oth of April, 1864, the same conditions

were still observed : none of the embiyos had escaped. At the above-men-
tioned date (July 18), ova were also put into another jar of pond-water,
with horse-dung added. In this case (September 23) a few living embryos
were detected, free and active. On the 25th of April, 18G4, I found the

eggs still segmenting, a few with embryos ; but none of the latter were
observed free. At the same period (July 18) other eggs were deposited in
simple horse-dung ; and here also (September 23) a few embryos had freed

themselves of their egg-covering, and were still living. On the 25th April,
1864, I found numerous embryos free, active, and much grown.

   On the 23rd December, 1863, I still found the majority of the eggs in

the fresh water (of April 24th), with theu* embryos coiled in the interior
and aUve. One free embryo was particulaiiy active, and there were several

empty shells. On the 25th April, 1864, they still seemed to have under-

gone no material change, and I did not on this occasion observe any free

embryos.

   As the free embryos of A. megalocephcda, reared in horse-dung, had, on

the 4th of January, 1864, attained considerable size, and likewise exhibited

traces of the sexual organs, I washed them out of the excreta ; and, after

straining through muslin, they were placed in a large jar with the water

Myemployed in separating them.  next object was to administer part of

them to a horse, with the view of rearing the sexually matiu-e woim. This

was done on the 26th of April, 1864 ; but here again I was prevented

ascertaining the result. The horse, becoming violent and vicious (from other

causes), was slaughtered on the seventh day after the worm-feeding ; and,

by another mischance, I was also prevented from examining the intestines.

   When I last examined the ova first placed in fresh water on the 24th of
April, 1863, many of them still displayed living embryos in their interior,

whilst hundreds of embiyos were found free ; the latter, however, showed
no further advance in growth, and were by no means so active and healthy-

looking as those contained in the jar of impure water. I satisfied myself,

moreover, that these last were a trijfie more advanced in development.

   10. Oxyuris vermicularis.-- On the 22nd December, 1862, numerous eggs

were deposited in the substance of the pulp of two partially rotten pears

and one decayed apple. I had not noticed embryos in cmy of the eggs at
the time of their lodgment within the parent oviducts ; but, on examining

the fruits ten days later (January 1st, 1863), I found many of the ova to
contain the characteristic tadpole-hke embryos of Oxyuris. On the 13th of

March following, none of the embryos appeared to have escaped their shells ;
but when I again examined these pears and the apple, on the 17th and 18th

of the succeechng July, I found multitudes of minute nematodes which, at
          ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND MIGRATIONS OP THE ENTOZOA. 117

 the time, I referred to the ova and embryos in question. To add strength to
 that conclusion, I noticed a number of empty egg-shells of Ox-}/iiris amongst
 the loose and decayed vegetable parenchyma. These little nematodes mea-

^sured about of an inch in length, but their form did not correspond vnth

 the shape of the Oxi/uris-emhrjo. The contents of one of the pears and the
aj^ple were subsequently employed in new experiments ; but the other pear,
which had now become thoroughly rotten and of a blackish-brown colour,

Avas retained for the purpose of preserving these j'oimg nematodes. On the

23rd of September, 1863, I again examined this pear, and found a consider-
able number of the nematodes which had scarcely advanced in length or

breadth. On the day following (24th) I had an opportunity of showing
them to Professor Leuckart, of Giessen, who considered it possible that they

might be the young of Oxyuris, notwithstanding their little resemblance to

the tadpole-like condition of the embryo as it exists in ova. He suggested

the jn'obability, however, of their being AnguUhilce, and was resolved to

satisfy his doubt on this score by repeating my experiment. It is known

that AnguilJuJa may suddenly make their aj^pearance in decaying vegetable

matter under similar conditions to those here recorded : but it seemed rather

singiilar that they should appear in such remarkable abundance in the three

specimens of fruit specially selected for my experiment. The fact that

empty egg-shells were found in the pear, associated with the equally im-

])ortant fact that, before I introduced the eggs, I took the precaution to

examine the partially decayed pulp of these fruits, and ascertained that no
AncfuiUiilce or other nematodes existed in them, appeared at the time to
warrant the conelusion that the nematodes in question could only be refer-

able to Oxyiu-ls verniicuJaris. I have, however, since satisfied myself that
they were true Anguillules {A. pyri, T.S.C.)*.

   On the 18th July, 1863, a portion of decayed pear, containing the Anguil-

hiles, was placed in cowdung. This mass, though inclosed in a jar, became
very diy at the surface ; but on the 23rd September, when it was carefully
examined, several of the young nematodes were still alive, though very little
advanced in size. One, which appeared dead and rather smaller than the
others, still measured only the ^^ of an inch.

    At the same date (July 18) others were placed in the same material, with
water added, and here also I subseqiiently (September 23) found a few
inactive individuals. One appeared to be quite dead, its parenchyma having
degenerated into a mass of large fat-globules.

   At the same date (July 18), several Anguillules were placed, with portions
of the pear, in a small jar of pond-water. Niimbers of these were after-
wards found (Sept. 23) at the bottom of the vessel, stretched out and
exhibiting very few signs of vitality. They displayed traces of a phaiynx,
but the intestinal canal had not devekped. Their bodies only contained a

quantity of fine granules.

   At the same date (July 18) a considerable number of the Anguillules were

   * Having recently forwarded specimens to Mr. Henry Charlton Bastian, F.L.S., that
gentleman (who has specially and most successfully devoted his attention to the free
nematoids) has informed me (December 30th, 1864) that he recognizes two distinct spe-
cies from the pear. They belong to his genera ApheleucTms and Flectus respectively,

" two out of the foiu" genera whose members possess extraordinarj' tenacity of life." He

proposes to call the one AplielevcJms pyri, leaving the other at present imdescribed. The
portions of pear which I forwarded were perfectly dry and brittle ; and in confirmation of

--my statements rcppccting tlic vitahty of the nematodes, Mr. Bastian remarks, in a letter

to me, as follows : " Alter soaking I'or a few hours in water they resumed all their acti-
vity, as you had obseiTed."--Jan. 21st, 1865.
118 REPOET--18G4.

mixed with simple moist horse-dung, which Avas also examined (September

--23), with the following result : Many were found alive, one or two being

active, but most of them closely coiled upora themselves in various ways.

Those that were stretched out and apparently hfeless were afterwards seen

to move slowly their slightly curved tails. In one example the digestive
tube, from mouth to anus, seemed well developed and complete, and in none

of them did there appear to be any traces of decomposition.

On the 5th of October, 1863, I re-examined the AnguiUules in the pear

and found them still aUve. The longest measured ^L-".

   On the 28th October, 1863, I commenced a new series of experiments

(ten in number), with the view of verifying the previous results. I again

procured a considerable number of perfectly fresh eggs, containing embryos,
and placed them in portions of decayed apples and pears ; and in aU cases I

examined these fruits with high magnifying powers, previous to my employ-

ing them for experiment. In no single instance could I detect the presence
of AnguiUulce, or any other kind of animal parasite, within their parenchyma.

   On the 30th December, 1863, T re-examined the apples and pears, which

had all become mouldy. In none could I find any free embryos ; and the
contents of the eggs appeared to have perished, the eggs themselves having

turned to a yellow-brown colour'. I strained off the pulp in water, for sub-

sequent examination, before finally abandoning this series of experiments.

   On the 4th Januaiy, 1864, I commenced another series of experiments,

with the view of again testing the results above mentioned. I procured two

partially decayed pears and one apple, and (having by careful microscopic
examination satisfied myself that they contained no animal parasites of any

kind) I inserted several entire female Oxyurides, and also a few loose ova,

Ainto each.  very large proportion of the eggs contained the characteristic

tadpole-like embryos. On examiaing the decayed fruits, on the 20th April,

1864, I could find no trace of the embryonic Oxyurides ; neither were there

any AnguiUules.

These several sets of experiments appeared sufficient to establish the fact

that we cannot rear the eggs of embryos of O.vyuris either in fresh or in de-

caying vegetable matters.

The presence of AnguUlules in the original experiment must be regarded

' as accidental ; but as their development is not without interest, I may,
  before dismissing the subject, further observe that, on the 30th December,

1863, I reexamined one of the pears, which was first employed for experi-
ment more than a year previously (December 22nd, 1862). In the pulp

(which was perfectly free from mould, though stiU in a loosely closed vessel)

I found large numbers of Anguillides in every conceivable stage of develop-

ment, from the early free embryo, measuiing -^~', to the sexually mature

condition, measuring -^J'. Some of , them contained a single egg. There

were also a few discoloured Oxyurls-eggs, with dead granular contents, and a

considerable number of free AnguiUuline ova. These latter were pale, almost

colourless, and contained actively moving embryos in their interior, totally

unlike those of Oxyuris. On the 20th April, 1864, hundreds of the Anguil-

lules were stiU living. They were still living on the 21st of July last, and,

I have no doubt, are yet in the enjoyment of an active vitality.
   Eggs of Oxyuris, containing embryos, placed in water on the 22nd Decem-

ber, 1862, and others again on the 4th of January, 1864, failed either to

develope further or to set free their embryonic contents.

On the 5th October, 1863, I placed some fuU-grown female Oxyurides in

pure fresh water. On examining the water (December 23, 1863), I found
ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND MIGRATIONS OF THE ENTOZOA. 119

that a largo number of the eggs had escaped (probably by the bursting of the
worms), some of which contained the characteristic tadpole-like embryos. I
could not, however, find one single embryo, although there were hundreds
of empty eggs and broken-up egg-shells. One embryo presented an appear-

--ance of central division the only instance I had seen up to the date in

question.

   From a subsequent and final examination, it was clear that the yelk and

embryonic contents of all the ova had disiategrated, sometimes causing the

shell to burst.

   On the 2nd of January, 1863, I fed a monkey (Maeacus) with numerous
eggs of Oxyuris, containing living embrj'os. On the 11th of Pcbruary this

animal was destroyed ; but there were no young Oxyuiides discoverable in its
intestinal canal. At one time 1 almost looked for a positive result, as the
monkey displayed marked signs of anal iiTitation after the worm-feeding.

   On the 10th and on the 14th of January, 1863, fresh eggs of Oxyuns, in

which the characteristic embryos were well developed, were admiaistered

to a large goat. This animal was destroyed on the 21st of January, without

--furnishing any other than a negative result.
   11. Strowjylus armatus. On the 9th of March, 1863, I placed a quantity

of the eggs of this species in a jar of fresh water, without any vegetable

matter. On examining the contents of the jar, on the 16th of the folio wing-

July, I could find no embryos, ova, or entire egg-shells ; but there was a

--quantity of granular debris at the bottom of the vessel.
   12. Prosthecosacter injlexus. Through the kindness of 3Ir. Kiel, I received,
on the 19th of October, 1863, the lujags of a porpoise which had just died
at the Zoological Society, Eegent's Park. The hmgs were quite fresh, and

plugged throughout by the presence of multitudes of this parasite. After

examining the ova very carefully, I placed a quantity of them, afready con-
taining incompletely developed embryos, in salt water ; and I also mixed
some of the bronchial mucus of the porpoise (which, besides eggs, contained

several free embryos) with salt water in a separate vessel.

   On the 23rd December, 1883, I carefuUy examined the contents of both

jars. In the jar originally containing eggs only, I found one egg with an

embryo stiU coiled within it, many of the other eggs having apparently dis-

appeared, leaving a very small quantity of debris, partly consisting of sheU-

fragments. Two living embryos were detected, severally measuring about

yij" and -Jy".  They  displayed    a  tolerably  complete  digestive apparatus
                                                                                                                                                 ;

but there were no certain traces of sexual organs. There were a few speci-

mens of Euplotes traveUing about.

The jar containing eggs and yoxmg displayed, at the same date of exami-

nation, several active embryos in all respects resembling those above men-

tioned, and also an astonishing number of animalcules (Euplotes). But

there were also several larval nematodes of much larger size, and yet possi-

bly belonging to the same species. There were, it is tme, some slight
diiferences, possibly due to their more advanced growth. They measured
about Jy".

   On 25th April, 1864, I found both jars to contain living embryos, those
mixed with frothy mucus from the bronchi being more niuuerous and much

more largely developed. The longest specimen, developed from the ova,

measured no more than ^" in length.

   "When I last examined the contents of these jars (July 21, 1864), both
still contained living worms, the larger specimens reared from the egg still

measuring only -^L of an inch. The largest embryo from the jar containing

the frothy mucus measured, as before, about -^-fj", and displayed, moreover,
rudimentary traces of male reproductive organs.

           Report on the Physiological Action of Nitrite of Amyl.

               By Benjamin W. Richardson, M.A.,M.D.

The Eeport which I have the honour to lay before the Physiological Section

springs out of a short paper read at the Newcastle Meeting last year, entitled

" On the Physiological Action of the Nitrite of Amyl." In that paper I

stated a few preliminary facts, to one or two of which I would again briefly

direct attention, in order that the present audience may be enabled to follow

the subject, connectively, from its commencement.
    The nitrite of amyl is a fluid of amber colour, and having a flavoiu- and

odour of over-ripe pears. It approaches, in fact, in matter of flavour the

acetate of oxide of amyl, the substance commonly sold under the name of

essence of pears. The composition of the nitrite is 0,^11^; NOg+HO. It

--is made by the action of nitrous acid gas on fusel oil amylic alcohol. The

fluid, when pure, has a specific gravity of 913, and it boils at lS2'^rahr. It

is soluble in equal parts of chloroform, pure alcohol, and ether.
    Diffused through the air in a chamber or jar, the vapour of nitrite of

amyl extinguishes flame unless it be largely diluted with air, or unless the
flame be introduced slowly. Under the latter circumstances the vapour ex-
plodes in a sharp puff".

    Placed so as to diffiise through a closed bottle or jar with phosphorus, it

prevents the oxidation of the phosphorus.

   Placed in a closed jar with animal or vegetable substances, it acts like am-
monia, ether, chloroform, and alcohol in preventing decomposition. As an
antiseptic it is equal to ammonia, but is less active in this respect than chlo-

roform, ether, and alcohol. It also is objectionable in that it destroys the

colour of both vegetable and ainmal structures, turning the vegetable reds
brown, and giving to the muscular tissues of animals, fii'st a pale white, and
afterwards a dirty brown appearance.

Physical Effect on Dead Organic Matters.

I have made a large number of experiments to determine the antiseptic

--power of the nitrite, of which I may give a few illustrations.
    Observations. Series 1. Pive minims of nitrite of amyl were placed in a

Aglass jar capable of receiving 40 cubic inches of common air.  rose with

leaves attached to the stalk was next placed in the jar, and the stopper was

inserted. In a few minutes the green coloiu- of the rose was turned of a

dirty brown, and the red colour, moving at first to violet, lapsed also after a

time into brown. After the colour was in this way destroyed no further

change followed, and the flower remained in the jar for nine months without

undergoing the slightest decomposition. This experiment was repeated with

mignonette, calceolarias, leaves of camellias, and other plants ; the results

were the same.

  --Observations. Series 2. The %-iscera of animals and portions of the mus-

cular structiu'e were placed in jars capable of receiving 100 cubic inches of

air. Into each jar was then poured half a drachm of the nitrite of amyl,

and the jar was closed. The efltct in every case was to change the animal
ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION OF NITRITE OF AMYL.  121

 tissue of a whitey -brown colour, which in time became dark or dirty looking.

 Decomposition of the tissue was, however, arrested, and I have several speci-
 mens of a pathological character which have been thus preserved for six

 months.

     In the extreme heat of the past summer, I placed in jars of equal size
 two frogs that had recently died ; the jars were lightly covered with cloth

 substance, and each one was covered to the same extent. Into one jar was
 poured ten minims of the nitrite ; the other was left imtouched. The frog in
 the jar that contained common air only was rapidly decomposing in six hours,
 and on the following day was putrid. The frog in the jar through which the
 nitrite was diffused in vapour was quite fresh three days after, and remained
 fresh so long as the smell of the nitrite could be detected, showing that it had

not entirely evaporated. When the odour could no longer be perceived,

 signs of putrefaction were observed in the animal, and these gradually ad-

 vanced, but the change was very slow, and the body dried up at last rather
 than putrefied.

  --Ohservations. Series 3. Si)ecimens of blood were drawn into open glass

 vessels, containing proportions of nitrite varying from one to fifteen per cent,
in respect of the blood drawn. The blood thus charged coagulated in the
usual manner and in the natural space of time ; it became, however, of a dirty
red colour. Set aside in the open air, serum escaped from the clot ; but the
upper surface of the blood, instead of soon becoming of a bright red from the
absorption of oxygen, remained long dark. In proportion to the time of escape
of the nitrite the blood remained free from decomposition, and the i^eriod of
change in each vessel (five vessels were used) varied precisely according to
the degree with which the blood, while in the fluid state, was charged with
the nitrite. So long as there was distinct odour of the amyl-compound
there was no change. The tu-st sign of change, which even in the specimens
containing the lowest chiti-ge was never observed before six hours, consisted
in reddening of the upper surface of the clot ; then softening followed, decom-

position, and fluidity. In the heat of summer I found blood containing
fifteen per cent, of the nitrite remain unchanged for five days. The same
observations were made on simple albuminous fluids, on fluids from animal
cysts, and on saliva and certain other of the excretions.

  We gather from these experiments that nitrite of amyl, like chloroform,

alcohol, or other bodies to which reference has been made, arrests by its pre-
sence the change known as decomposition, preventing by catalysis the com-
bination of oxygen. That the nitrite itself remains tmdecomposed admits of
ready proof, because it can be re-collected ; and that it does not combine with
the structures or parts of the structures which it preserves, is shown by the
fact that the process of decomposition is set up only as the nitrite makes its
escape by evolution.

                                          Effects on the Skin.

  --Ohservations. Series 4. When nitrite of amyl is applied to the cuta-

neous human surface and held in close contact with it by being placed under

oiled silk or tinfoil, it produces after a brief period some injection of the vessels,
and a slight tingling sensation with heat. If the skin be prc^dously moist-
ened with water for a long time, the efi'eet of the nitrite is somewhat increased

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

but at no time is the action so rapid and marked as is that of chloroform or
turpentine. To test the relative poAvers of the nitrite and of chloroform, I
122  REPORT 186J;.

placed a pledget of bibulous paper an inch square, and saturated with nitrite,

on one of my arms, and covered the paper with thin metal. On the other

arm I placed a similar pledget saturated with chloroform, and covered it in
the same manner. The nitrite, retained on until it was quite dry, produced

 only pale redness and slight irritation : the chloroform caused great pain,
so that I had some difficulty to keep it on, intense iujection and redness, and
some excoriation of skin.

    At the same time I may observe that the nitrite is undoubtedly absorbed

by the skin. To prove this, I applied it to the skin of a frog by immersiug
the hinder limbs of the animal in a solution of it. In a few minutes the
symptoms which markedly characterize the action of the substance, viz.,
violent circulatory action followed by prostration, were developed. I also

applied some of the substance to my own skin, carefully retaining it in con-

tact over a six-inch surface : during the application the pulse rose, sensa-

tion of fullness in the head followed, and other signs which will be more

fully described in the sequel.

  --Observations. Series 5. Administered by the mouth the nitrite is com-

paratively slow in its action, but very decisive. Administered to rabbits in
doses of five, ten, fifteen and tweuty minims, and in more potent doses, its

effects are striking. It admits of being readily given in tincture diluted

with water. In five-minim doses it produces on these animals temporary
excitement. The circulation is quickened, the breathing is quickened, the
pupil is dilated, and the animal is restless ; the symptoms subside in from five

to ten mimites, and no harm seems to have been done. In doses of ten
minims the symptoms are the same, but more marked. In doses of twenty
minims, after the stage of excitement has passed away, depression follows,
and continues several minutes, and there may be feeble convulsive action,
but the animal recovers. There is no indication of vomiting.

   In drachm doses the nitrite is often fatal to dogs, cats, and rabbits. The
symptoms induced are violent action of the heart, rapid breathing, -v^-ide
dilatation of the pupil, con\'nlsions, not clonic but quick, and after an inter-
val of a few minutes rapid collapse and paralysis of motion. The heart falls
in its beats to a minimum, and the breathing may be reduced to one re-
spiration in two or even four minutes. To appearance, in fact, the animal is
nearly dead. It lies hke an animal profoimdly narcotized with chloroform,

but still it feels. When it is touched at any part or hghtly pinched, it Avinces

instantly if it has the power to move. The period of death is usually pro-
longed ; and often when the animal seems so nearly dead that recovery
appears hopeless, it continues still to breathe, it throws off the nitrite by the

--lungs, and ultimately recovers.
    Observations. Series 6. Administered by inhalation, the effects of the
nitrite are elicited with remarkable precision and quickness, and the pheno-
mena are amongst the most striking, perhaps are the most striking of any I

have seen in all my large physiological experience. If a piece of bibulous paper

be formed into a tube, and if an expanded end of the tube be made to absorb
two or at most three minims of the nitrite, a surface sufficiently charged for
inhalation even by the human subject is obtained. If the tube, charged as
directed, be held about two inches from the nose, and respiration be carried
on in the usual manner, the following symptoms rapidly show themselves.
The action of the heart is suddenly and greatly increased, so that in one
minute I have counted it rising eighty beats ; the breathing also becomes

quickened ; the face becomes deeply suffused with blood, the suffusion extend-

ing over the whole face, down the neck, and in persons who are bald, more or
ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION OF NITRITE OF AMYL.  123

less over the head. The eyes are also injected, aud occasionally fill with tears ;
the pupil slightly dilates, and over the suffused surface there is sensation of
heat, described by some as bixrning heat, and by others as mere tingling.

When these symptoms are at their height, a peculiar sensation is felt in the

head, a sensation of tightness across the forehead, of fullness, giddiness, and
prostration, but with no acute pain. The agent being taken away, the effects

cease rapidly.

   I have now witnessed these effects on more than two hundred occasions,
and have experienced them myseK forty times : I can pronounce them abso-
lute and valid phenomena, in no way dependent on mental exciteinent or
fancied excitement. They are nevertheless developed differently in intensity

in different persons, and they even slightly differ in the same person on
different occasions. I wUl give briefly two examples.

   On Mr. Kempton, a friend who has inhaled the vapour many times, the

effect on the heart is so rapid that it can be felt after the first three inhala-

tions. His pulse wiU rise from 72 to 105 in ten seconds, and he is conscious
of pulsation in every large artery in his body. His face becomes as red as
vermUion, and is not only subjectively but objectively heated.

   On Dr. Gibb, after inhalation a quarter of a miuute, the pulse rises during

the followiag quarter minute eight beats, and during the next quarter twenty
beats ; rising successively from 68 beats per minute to 76 and 88 ; the face
meantime becomes gTcatly siiffused, and giddiness is experienced. In both
the gentlemen named, the liiilse comes down to the natm-al standard in twQ

minutes after cessation of the inhaling process. On myself the symptoms

are almost identical with those presented by Dr. Gibb.
    In one instance I was so unhappy as to see the inhalation carried to the

extreme of danger. An incredulous friend seeing a bottle of the nitrite on
my library mantelshelf, during a minute in which I was absent from the
room, opened the bottle and commenced inhaling from the mouth. When I

returned I found him walking the library still inhaling, his face and neck red
as raw beef. In spite of all I could do, he would continue, till as he said he
felt some effect. While I was using forcible efforts to get the bottle from

him, he suddenly gave it me himself, and became speechless. I shall never
forget the gallop of that man's heart. As he leaned against a table, the
table vibrated and recorded visibly the pulsations. He panted for breath as
one who has run to the extremity : I could not get him to move reasonably,

and had the greatest difficulty in leading him into the open air. In a little
time the excitement declined, and was succeeded by depression and partial
loss of power ; but fortunately he slowly recovered, and I do not think he
was any worse for his misadventure : although, being a stout middle-aged
man, I feared that during the excitement some paischief might have happened

to the vessels of the brain.

   In the anxiety of looking after this gentleman, I did not count minute by
miuute the pulsations of the heart ; but the action was at one time IciO per
minute, and the violence was extreme : both sounds were lost, or rather they
occurred so qvdckly that the ear coidd not distinguish them, and the rapid
motion communicated a peculiar synchronous tremor to the upper limbs.

   My friend explained to me afterwards that his first sensation was that of

burning in the face, but that he thought this arose from laughing ; that the
next thing he felt, and which at length alarmed him, was the hearing the

pulsations of his own body very loudly and painfully. Then he felt a pecu-

liar powerlessness which could not be described ; but at no time did he lose

either sensation or consciousness. I estimated, from the loss in the bottle.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

12'i REPORT-- 1864.

that this gentleman had been exposed to the vajjour derived from the escape

of twenty minima of the nitrite, much of which necessarily was lost by dis-

tribution in the air.

    In a long series of experiments I have submitted animals to the inhalation
of the nitrite, and with the most interesting results. I must, at the risk of

being tedious, give the salient points of observation.
    Into a jar capable of receiving 200 cubic inches of air, a large healthy

frog was placed, and ten minims of the nitrite were sloAvly introduced.
The animal, after exhibiting violent vascular action with reddening of the
feet, sank into a condition which so closely resembled death, that I thought
it was dead. At 11 o'clock at night it remained the same (the experi-
ment was made at 8 p.m.), and I laid it aside as dead; but I was struck
with one fact, that the eyelid was not contracted, as is common in these ani-
mals after dissolution : on the following morning, upon going into the labo-
ratory, I found the animal alive and as active as though nothing had happened

to it.

   Tliis observation led me natiu-ally to make many inquiries as to the con-

dition of frogs during this state of suspended animation ; and I found little
difficulty in obtaining a repetition of the phenomenon. The experiment
usually succeeds well, and the suspension of animation may, under proper
supervision, be sustained even for days. In one case an animal came back
to consciousness after nine days. The experimentalist miist, however, be
prepared for some failiu'es. Thus, if the frogs are not fresh and strong, if
they have been kept in confinement for some weeks, and are thin and feeble,
the experiment will fail ; or if after the cessation of motion the animal is left
too dry, so that he loses water, the experiment will not succeed ; or if the

amount of am yl -vapour given is too great, the experiment may not succeed.
   In six cases where the animals recovered, I made numerous observations.

Examining the web of the foot, T found that there was no sign of circulation
there. Laying open the thigh muscles and exposing them to continuoiis

galvanic current as well as to the induction-current, and to shocks from the
positive conductor of the friction-machine, I found no evidence of irritability.

Exposing the muscles to water warmed to various degrees, from 70° to 120°
Pahr., there was no evidence of irritability. The only circumstance that
would lead an observer to infer that death had not actually taken place, was
that the limbs remained flaccid. In cases where rhjor mortis came on,
although the animals would lie for many hours without undergoing decom-
position, they never afterwards showed signs of irritability, but idtimately
became flaccid and decomposed.

   On warm-blooded animals the nitrite produces conditions similar, but not

so extreme in character. Administered gradually by inhalation to a strong
rabbit until complete prostration was induced, I laid the animal on a (able
and found that the respirations were reduced to one per minute. The limbs

were flaccid and motionless ; and when they were moved and were laid in any
Bgiven position, there they remained. The pupils were widely dilated, and
the red portions of the body, as the mucous membranes of the moiith and

eyelids, were absolutely white ; the action of the heart could not be felt, nor
was it certain that the motion could be heard with the stethoscope. Cer-
tainly the two sounds were lost. In this condition, breathing softly but
sharply once in sixty or eighty seconds, the animal continued for two hours
then the breathing gradually rose. In throe hours and a quarter the action
of the heart could be felt by the hand ; in three liours there Avas movement
of the limbs, and in five hours the animal had recovered so as to be able to
ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION OF NITRITE OF AMYL.  125

 move. The animal, whenever he had the power, winced on being touched,

 and showed signs of consciousnes.s.
    In an experiment performed by Dr. Gibb and myself, a cat was rapidly

 struck down by being placed in a thousand cubic inch jar through which the

 vapour from one fluid-drachm of the nitrite had been diffused from a surface
 of bibulous paper. Death took place in two minutes. The animal was re-
 moved and was watched with great care, but the breathing had ceased. The

pupils were dilated to their fullest extent. After a time we laid open the
 chest. On exposure to the air, the heart was found contracting most vigo-
 rously, and soon the muscles of respiration also commenced spontaneously to
 contract, moving the ribs, and disturbing the abdominal viscera. The dia-
phragm contracted very steadily, and a muscle of the thigh, on being laid

 bare, did the same. These contractions actually continued spontaneously
from twenty-four minutes past twelve until forty-eight minutes past one in

--the day a phenomenon which has I believe never before been observed after

 death in any of the muscles of warm-blooded animals except the heart.
     Eespecting the heart itself, in this case it continued contracting on the

right side when all the other muscles were at rest. To observe the local
action of the nitrite on the heart, we gradually instilled three minims of it on
 the right auricle. The muscular structure soon became of a dirty white, but
 the contractions continued. At seven in the evening the amicle, with a seg-
 ment of the ventricle, was still contracting five times in the minute ; at ten
 o'clock it was contracting in the same way, although the lower limbs of the
 animal were rigid from rigor mortis ; at twelve (midnight) it was contracting
at the rate of two per minute ; at one it was reported by Dr. Henry as con-
tracting strongly from one to two beats per minute ; at five a.m. I found it
myself contracting three times in a minute and a half, and at eight it made a
contraction on being touched with a needle. Eor many hours before this all
the other muscles of the body were rigid. Thus there was witnessed the

strange phenomenon of muscular contractility in the heart while all the other

muscles were rigid ; and of muscular contractility of the heart for nearly

eighteen hours after what would technically be considered the death of the

 animal.

  --Observations. Series 7. If instead of administering the nitrite of amyl

through the skin, by the mouth, or by the lungs, it be injected under the skin
with a hollow needle, it exerts its influence in the same way, and leads,

though more slowly, to the same symptoms. From an injection of twenty
minims decided symptoms are induced in such animals as rabbits, cats, and
dogs, but after a time they recover. In the case of a yonng cat. Dr. Gibb
and I slowly instilled twenty minims of the nitrite under the skin, and when
the first symptoms had subsided we instilled twenty more. The result was

that the animal feU into a powerless condition, but continued to breathe.

Four hours after the last instillation it was the same, and was breathing six
times in the minute. Eight hoirrs afterwards, the upper and lower limbs
and the muscles of the neck being rigid, it was breathing once in two minutes,
and the respiratory motion did not absolutely cease for two hours later.

  --Observations. Series 8. Local effects of the nitrite. I have made some

very minute observations on the effect of the nitrite upon the capillary vessels

Aof the web of the frog's foot. The results are very uniform and decisive.

few seconds after the web is treated with the nitrite, the capillary vessels arc
seen to dilate to more than twice their natural calibre, and the rate of motion

of blood is immensely quickened. After an interval of fifty or sixty seconds,
the vessels become tortuous as from irregular contraction of their walls ; then
126 REPORT--1864.

there follo'ws a decided narro\\dng of the vessel at its minutest part, which
continues until at last the vessel becomes indistinct, and all motion of blood
is lost, except a faint oscillation in vessels which are running transversely
into a main current. These experiments were confirmed by observations

made by my friends Dr. Henry and Mr. Yeats.

  --Observations. Series 9. On the Hood. The blood of animals destroyed

by the nitrite may always be smelt as charged with the substance. On a

large animal that had been killed by the injection of forty minims, I drew off
an ounce of blood from the right side of the heart into a flask, and on inha-
ling from the flask, absorbed suiRcient of the nitrite vapour to induce the
specific signs of its action. The fluid, however, in no way interferes with
coagulation, but, as I have said before, it arrests oxidation and decomposition.

On the corpuscles it exerts a powerful osmotic action. It has no effect on
them in the way of dissolution, nor does it, when added to them, destroy their

form or modify the central depression, but it reduces them to half their ordi-
nary size, leaving them well defined and capable of running together in the
ordinary and natural way.

   From these narrations of experiments we may learn, in brief, the following

facts in reference to the physiological action of the nitrite of amyl.

 --1. It is absorbed by the bodies of animals however introduced into the

organism by the skin, by the stomach, by the lungs, by the cellular tissue.
    2. After its absorption its effects are seen immediately on the heart and

circulation ; there is in the first instance violent action of the heart with
dilatation of the capillaries, followed by diminished but not extingiiished
power of the heart, and contraction of the extreme vessels. As an excitant

of vascular action, the nitrite of amyl may be considered the most powerful

agent as yet physiologically discovered.

   3. On animals, such as frogs, whose bodies admit of its removal sponta-

neously, and whose circulatory and respiratory systems are simple, the nitrite

suspends animation, and when the animals are placed under favourable con-
ditions for the process of recovery, they may recover after considerable periods
of time. There is no other known substance that suspends animation in
these animals for so long a period. On warm-blooded animals, which are
clothed in thick and less penetrable skin, and in whose bodies the circulatory
and respiratory systems are more complicated, the nitiite cannot actually
stop the movements of respiration and circidation without destroying life.
Eut even in these animals it can without destroying life reduce the forces of

respiration and circulation so extremely, that a condition precisely analogous

to what is known as trance or catalepsy in the human subject, can be brought
on and sustained for many hoiu's.

   4. The nitrite of amyl is not an ana>sthetic. By it consciousness is

never destroyed, unless a condition approaching to death be produced.

   5. The effects of the nitrite on the organism are directed to the motive
force, which it first wdldly excites and then subdues.

   6. The modus operandi of the nitrite appears to be by arresting the pro-

cess of oxidation in the tissues.
    7. Physically the nitrite holds a place between the volatile bodies, such

as chloroform, and the soUd bodies, such as opium and woorali. Hence its
effects are less evanescent than those of the very volatile substances, and less
certainly destructive than the solid substances. In this lies the secret of its

prolonged action.
ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION OF NITRITE OF AMYL.                                                                                                                                          127

                     Pathological Effects of the Nitrite of Amtl.

   In cases where the nitrite of amyl is carried to its extrcmest effects,
the appearances of the internal organs present some modifications. The
appearances are not the same in every instance, hut vary according to the
mode in which the suhstance is administered. If it be administered very
quickly, the lungs and all the other organs are found blanched and free of
blood, the right side of the heart is engorged with blood, and the left side is
empty, the brain being free of congestion. If the substance be administered
slowly, the lungs are congested, the brain is congested, and blood is found
both on the right and left sides of the heart. The organs of the body are
also of a dirty reddish-brown colour, and the blood is similarly discoloured,
]io distinction in colour existing between the arterial and venous bloods.
Notwithstanding the violent action of the heart, I have never seen rupture of
any vessel nor extravasation of blood. The inner lining of the blood-vessels
is unchanged, and the valvular mechanism of the heart maintains its integrity.
It is to be remembered that these observations have all been made on healthy

animals.

COMFAEISON' OF EfFECTS OF THE NlTEITE WITH OTHER AlITL-COMPOirNDS

AND OTHER BoDIES.

--Observations. Series 10. I have compared the action of nitrite of amyl

with certain other of the amyl-compouuds, but I have not had sufficient time

to complete this line of research, each new compound opening up for itself a
new field of observation rich in varietj-. As yet I have only tried the com-

parison vtith amylene and acetate of amyl. Amylene differs fi-om the ni-

trite in that it acts as an anaesthetic                                                                                                                                                  but it resembles the nitrite in exciting
                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

the circulation in a minor degree and in causing redness of the skin. The

symptoms produced by amylene are, however, very transitory as compared

with those following the use of nitrite ; there is this in common, that neither
of them entirely destroy consciousness, but amylene destroys sensibility, which

the nitrite does not. T once saw Dr. Snow give amylene to a boy who was

being subjected to an operation, and who was playing with a ball the whole
time. The acetate of amyl, in comparison with the nitrite, seems to me to
produce a more marked local and a less severe general effect. It causes on

inhalation, not only redness of the face, but swelling and soreness of the

mucous surfaces, without any violent excitation of the heart. Erom chloro-

form the nitrite differs in that it does not produce anaesthesia ; and the same
remark applies to ether, the monochlorm-etted chloride of ethyle, nitrous

oxide gas, Dutch hquid, turpentine, and ammonia, although it resembles all

these in that it excites the cii'culation in the early stages of its action. The
only substance which approaches the nitrite in action is woorah, a vegetable
compound which is much the same in its elementary composition. Woorali
produces less preliminary excitement of the circulation, it paralyzes more

determinately all the muscles except the heart, and being a solid substance,
possessing no means of escaping from the body except in solution, it is more
slowly eliminated. Woorali and the nitrite have, however, this in common,
they produce paralysis of the extreme filaments of nerves before they influence
the centi-al portions of the nervous circuit.

     Cause of the EAProiTY of the CiRctrLATioN under Nitrite of Ajitl.

  Why the nitrite of amyl should produce such suddenly increased action of

the heart is a point of great physiological interest. I thought at first that
/28 REPORT--18G4.

r

\liis must be an effect primarily manifested on the blood, then on the heart,

and through the increased impetus of the heart, on the capillary circulation.

It was, however, soon apparent that the injection of the capillary sj'stem was

too quickly developed to be a sequence of mere overaction of the pulsatoiy
power of the central organ of the circulation, and the experiments on the web

of the frog's foot settled the question, I think, absolutely. It is possible

that the action of the nitrite is exerted immediately upon the extreme fila-

ments of the vaso-motor nerves, and that the heart beats quickly, because

the resistance to its force is taken off by the dilatation of the minute vessels

which it supplies with blood. At the same time the vascular currents of the

heart itself are quickened, and its movement is intensified proportionately.

 --On the facts so far presented in this Report, two questions call for a mo-

ment's consideration. The first is: Whether we ought dogmatically to
deny the possibihty of placing the human body in such a condition that it may

for some hours, or even some days, assume the appearance of temporary

Wedeath ?  are conversant of rare cases of disease, called cases of trance or

catalepsy, in which life, seeming for an interval suspended, is restored : we

have heard of other cases in which it is said that certain natives of India who

are called Fakirs, produce, by some secret art, an imitation of death so de-

terminate that the most iateUigent are deceived. I cannot but feel, after

what I have seen in the experiments on which the present inquiry is based,

that the explanation of the cataleptic state admits of a better solution than

ever before it chd, and that the validity of the Fakir experiment is rendered,

at the least, probable. I doubt not that in catalepsy there is formed in the
body itself a chemical substance which, without actually stopping the motions

of the heart and of respiration, suspends them so nearly that passive life only

is carried on, and that this condition is contimied ixntil such time as the sub-
stance is removed from the cii'culation. I conceive it is also qiiite reasonable

to presume that the Fakir holds in his hand some substance derived from the
vegetable world, which, more effective than the agent that has been before

us this day, possesses the power, when introduced into the body, of suspend-
ing the common signs of animation for a certain number of hours, and that
" in this borrowed likeness of slu'unk death " the facts of the phenomena are

--presented and explained.
   The second question is : Whether, from what we have learned in this in-

quiry, any knowledge may be gathered relative to the application of the nitrite

of amyl as a remedy in disease ? I have been too closely and intently occu-

pied in the task of obtaining elementary facts, to devote time to the practical
elucidation of this important point. Eut, subject to further and better ex-
perience, I should infer that in cases where in a healthy organism sudden
death is apprehended from failure of the heart, as for example in syncope
from severe pain, fright, or inhalation of chloroform, the cautious administra-
tion of the nitrite by inhalation might call into action the faihng organ and
give it time to recover from the shock to which it has been subjected. Again,
I believe that in tetanus the nitrite might be employed with advantage.
Paralyzing the extreme filaments of nerves, and reducing the muscidar power

of all the voluntary muscles in the same manner as does woorali, the nitrite

possesses advantages over woorali which the man of science wiU at once

recognize. It is more easily administered ; it does not necessarily destroy

the power of the muscles of respiration, and it is much more easily removed

from the organism by excretion. It might therefore in tetanus, for which

there is now no remedy, be employed to suspend the violent spasm, and give

the system time to 1-.: j-,7 off the primary evil. Physiologists have long felt

that in tetanus this is tlie direction in which to move, and practice has shown

that whenever recovery does take place from tetanus, it has been in rare cases

where time has been gained, in cases, that is to say, where the sufferer has

lived through the acute stage of the terrible ordeal to which he has been

subjected.

As regards the mode of administration of tlie nitrite. It may be given by

direct inhalation ; it may be given by inhalation in combination with chloro-

form and ether                                                                  or it may be given by the mouth as an alcoholic tincture in
                                                                             ;

doses of three, five, or ten minims, or even in larger doses, according to the

effects produced. It would of course be the safest jilan to iise it in small

doses at first, and to keep up the effect by frequent and cautious repetition.

   In the course of prej)aring this lleport, many new lines of inquiry have
suggested themselves, and many temptations to leave the immediate subject
and to explore new paths and promising fields of discovery have been offered.
The examination of the whole of the amyl series of bodies in a physiological

point of view is particularly important. In this series there is probably to

be found another and safer anaesthetic than chloroform : in the same series

we may hope to find bodies analogous in their action to quinine ; and other

bodies more potent in suspending animation than the one to which I have

invited attention to-day. But I had one object before me, and that itself has

demanded undivided work. Should the labours thus far carried out be con-

sidered by this learned body of sufficient importance to call for further and

more extended research, I need only add that I shall feel myself the debtor

of the Section in being again its servant.

Report on Tidal Observations made on the Humber and Rivers Trent
   and Ouse, 1864. By a Committee, consisting of James Oldham^
    C.E.; J. F. Bateman, C.E., F.R.S.; John Scott Russell, C.E,,

    r.R.S. ; and Thomas Thompson.

Tour Committee for the above purpose, after reporting a series of tidal obser-
vatioris made at Hull, ISTew Holland, and Goole, at the Meeting of the British

Association at Cambridge in 1862, were reappointed for more extended ob-

servations, to be reported upon at Newcastle last year, but, owing to circum-

stances over which we had no control, we were unable then to comply with

the resolution of the Association ; but as the question of the tides of the

Humber and some of its tributaries was considered of importance in a scien-

tific point of view, the request was again repeated, and we your Committee

reappointed, with a grant of .£50 at their disposal for the expenses attending
our observations.

   Your Committee have now therefore to report to the Association that they
have obtained tidal observations at HuE, at Gainsborough on the Trent, and

at Goole and N"aburn Lock on the Yorkshire Ouse. Those at Hull were
obtained by your Committee from the Dock Company's gaiigc at that place
those at Goole from that of the Aire and Calder Navigation Company ; for
those at Naburn Lock permission was kindly given to your Committee by the
Commissioners of the Eiver Ouse Navigation to use their tide-gauge ; those
at Gainsborough were made at a point on the town side of the river about

300 yards below the bridge, from a gauge which we procured and erected.
The observations at each station were made at intervals of 15 minutes, and

extended over fifty-four tides, commencing at 12 o'clock at noon on the 9th of

    1864.
--130 REPORT 1864.

May, and ceasing at 12 o'clock at noon on the 6th of June of the present year.
The books in which the whole of the observations were entered are herewith

presented to the Association.

    In order, however, to give a more readily comprehended explanation of the
results of our labours, the entire sets of observations have been drawn in sec-

tion by contour lines, as will be seen by the accompanjdng drawings, also now
presented to the Association. The vertical lines give the hours and minutes

of the observed time of the tides in rising and faUing, and the horizontal lines
or divisions give in feet and inches the observed height of such rise and fall.
The red line running through each section represents the datum line of the
mean rise of the sea at Livei-pool, as given by the Ordnance Survey Board,
in the published work entitled " Abstracts of the principal lines of Spirit
Levelling in England and Wales, by Colonel Sir Henry James, E.E., F.R.S.,
&c." The zero of the tide-gauge in each case is represented by a dotted

line on the section above or below the red line, as the case may be : that of
Naburn Lock is 1-680 feet above the said line; Goole is 3-823 feet below;

Gainsborough 3-140 feet above ; and HuU 14-707 feet below. The tidal

wave is represented by the blue contour lines.
   During the whole of the time the observations were being made the

weather was not undily influenced by either rain or wind, and therefore the
tides were natui'al and of a regular character.

   The phenomenon as to the time of high water above a certain point of the
Hull Dock gauge, referred to in the last Eeport, is again verified, i. e. when
the tide has reached the 16-feet mark of the tide-gauge above the dock-sill,
or 1-293 feet above the mean rise of the sea at Liverpool, it then, in every
tide, wants exactly three hours to high water.

   water after the tide has reached the 8-feet mark, by Mr. Thomas Kendall,

    The fact exists ; but the immediate cause of this occurrence your Com-
mittee are still unable to determine, and must therefore leave the solutioa
for further light and knowledge to be brouglit to bear upon it.

   The nearest approximation to this fixed law occurs at Goole, where we
find that when the tide has reached the 8-feet mark of the tide-gauge, or
4-177 feet above the mean rise of the sea at Live -pool, the average time to

high water, as observed over twenty-seven tides aud recorded in the following

Tables, is 2 hours and 6 minutes, but the extreme variation is found to ex-
tend from 1 hour and 35 minutes to 2 hours and 25 minutes.

DREDGING ON THE COASTS OF NORTHUMBERLAND AND DURHAM. 189

Deep-sea Dredging on the Coasts of Northumberland and Durham,
                 in 1864. Reported by George S. Brady.

The following Heport is intended to embrace notices only of the more inter-
esting captures of the present year. Next year wo hope to be able to lay

before the section a general account of the results which have been obtained

during the three years in which our dredging has been assisted by the grants

of the British Association.

   In the course of the summer, eight days have been spent in dredging hvo

of these on the Durham coast, and six off the northern shores of Northumber-

land. The weather, on the whole, was good, or at least such as not to put a
stop to our operations, except during the two days spent on the Durham
coast, on both of which we were unfortunately driven into harboui' by violent

gales rising suddenly and unespectedlj\

   The Mollusca obtained this year are very poor, and afford little to remark
upon, the only species new to the district being Chiton alius, L., of which a

single specimen was dredged off Holy Island. Some of the sand-covered

Ascidians taken on the Durham coast require further examination. Two fine

examples of Stylifer Turtoni were dredged off Holy Island, adherent to an

Echinus pictus. With reference to this species, it maybe mentioned that,
though the dredges were put down, as we thought, on the very spot where we

obtained, last year, abundance oi Echinus neglect as (in some cases with Stylifers

attached), this time not one specimen of the Echinus came up. There must

have been plenty of it within a few yards of the dredge ; for the nature of

the locality, almost close beneath the cliffs of one of the Parne Islands,

precluded the possibility of any great error in this respect.

Amongst stalk-eyedCmstacea the followingdeservenotice: Atelecyclus hete-

roclon, Pagurus cuanensis, P.Hgndmanni, and P. ferrugineus, C'rangon AJlmani

C'.S2)inosus,C. nanus, and C'.fasciatus. Pagurusferrugineiis andCrangonfascia-

--tus are new to the district. The most important Amphipoda are the following
   Lysianassa Gostce, Anonyx Solbdllii, IJaploops tuhicola, Monocuiocles cari-

natus, Westwoodilla ccecula, Protomedeia Whitei, GEdiceros parvimanus, Urothoe

marinus, Dexamine vedlomensis, Ccdliope hidentata (undescribed), Eusirus Uel-

vetice, Heiscladus longieaudatus, Cheirocratus Mantis and Unciolaplanipes, the

two last named being new species, descriptions of which, by the Eev. A. M.

Norman, are appended to this Report. Of Ostracoda, besides Cythere contortcc
and C. avena, the following new species, also described by Mr. Norman, were

taken : Cythere latissima, C. guttata, C. multifora, C. Icevata, C. declivis, C.

ABradii, Cythereis dunelmensis, and C. limicola.  new Pycnogon, Nymphon

ruber, Hodge, was got on the Durham coast, and is described in the Appen-

dix. Thirty-two species of Echinodermata were obtained, and amongst them

several species of great interest. Off Dunstanbro' were taken three speci-

mens oi Antedon rosaceus, a very rarely noticed inhabitant of our district, and

Aseveral remarkably fine examples of Ophiopholis aculeata.     small Echinus

exhibited by Mr. Norman at the Manchester Meeting of the British Associ-

ation, and called by him E. neglectus, var. /3, was taken abundantly. This,

however, has claims to be regarded as a distinct species, and will be described

by Mr. Norman from his Shetland specimens under the name of Echinus

Apictus.  single fine specimen of Evhinocardiimi pennatijidum, Norman*,

was dredged off Holy Island. This is the more interesting as the specimen

   * This is the sjiecies described by the late Mr. Barrett from Shetland under the name
of Amphidetus gihhosus, Agassiz (Ann. & Mag. Nat. Hist. 2nd ser. vol. six. p. 33, pi. 7.

fig. 2). It is not, however, Agassiz's species.

taken by Mr. Barrett, in Shetland, from which alone the species has been

recognized as British, appears to have been lost. Three or four specimens of

Psolus squarnutas 'were taken off Holy Island.

Amongst Polyzoa, Mr. Alder reports the following as being new to the

  coast :                     Lepralia annulata and TuhuJipora hhidata.   Bugida Murrayana was

.

abundant, and appears to be pretty nearly confined to the east coast.

Among Hydrozoa the most interesting captm-es were Tahiclava cornucopia} (a

new species lately described by Mr. Norman from specimens taken in Shetland),

Plumularia mt/riophyllum, a rare species new to this coast, and Halicium

labrosum.

   Several fine Sponges were obtained off Dunstanbro', but these and the Fora-
miuifera have not yet been examined.

An Account of Meteorological and Physical Observations in Nine

   Balloon Ascents made in the years 1863 and 1864 (in continuation of
   thirteen made in the year 1862 and first part of 1863), under the
   auspices of the Committee of the British Association for the Advance-
   ment of Science, by James Glaisher, F.R.S., at the request of the
   Committee, consisting of Colonel Sykes, the Astronomer Royal, Lord

   Wrottesley, Sir D. Brewster, Sir J. Herschel, Dr. Lloyd, Admiral

   FitzRoy, Dr. Lee, Dr. Robinson, Mr. Gassiot, Mr. Glaisher, Prof.
   Tyndall, Dr. Fairbairn, and Dr. W. A. Miller.

The Committee on Balloon Experiments was appointed last year for the

following purposes :

1st. To examine the electrical condition of the air at different heights.

2nd. To verify the law of the decrease of temperature, and to compare the

constants in different states of the atmosphere.

With respect to the first of these objects, no progress whatever has been

1864.                                                                                                                                                                            Q
--194 REPORT 1864.

made in the past year, with the exception of preparing an instrument and

apparatus for the investigation.

   At the request of the Committee Mr. Flecming Jenkin kindly undertook

to superintend the construction of the instrument best adapted for the purpose,
but it unfortunately happens that no flame or fire of any kind can be admitted
into the car of the balloon for fear of igniting the gas, and this instrument,

Avhich was furnished a little before the end of the year 1863, was constructed
to be used with fire. It therefore had to be altered so that it covild be used
with water, but is not yet quite in a state for observation.

    It happens unfortunately that electrical experiments in balloons necessitate
the use of one constant flow of water, and occasionally of two flowing at the

same time, just below the car of the balloon.
    The Committee felt that the presence of water but little removed from

the instruments, if exercising no influence when the balloon was rising,

might exercise such an influence on the balloon falling and passing through
the just moistened atmosphere as to throw a very considerable doubt on
some of the experiments, particularly on those relating to the hxmiidity of
the air (a primary object of research), that I was requested to defer taking
them, that no doubt might rest on the results, till our knowledge on this

subject was much increased.
    The Committee consider that the general laws on the humidity of the air

have now so advanced, that electrical experiments may now be included,
providing that such observations can be made with safety to ourselves.

    With respect to the second of these objects, viz. verifying the law of the
 decrease of temperature in different states of the atmosphere. The Committee
 considered that this would be best attained by taking as many observations
 as possible, at times in the year and at times in the day at which no experi-
 ments had been made, for the purpose of determining whether the laivs which
 hold good at one time in the year, hold good at other times in the year, and
 also to determine whether the laws which hold good at noon, apply equally

 well at all other times in the day.

    The Committee at all times have pressed on me the importance of magnetic

 observations in the higher regions of the atmosphere, the Astronomer Eoyal
 suggesting the use of a horizontal magnet, and taking the times of its vibra-
 tion at different elevations, a method which is seldom practicable, owing to

 the balloon almost constantly revolving on its own axis. To obviate the

 effect of this, Dr. Lloyd suggested the use of a dipping-needle placed

 horizontal when on the ground by means of a magnet adjustible above it, so
 that when in the balloon the deviation from horizontality might be readily

 noticed, and which deviation would be independent of the revolving motion
 of the balloon, and could thus be noticed at any instant.

     I have been unable to attempt the latter method, as Dr. Lloyd wished some
 experiments to be made before the instrument should be constructed.

     At Newcastle a very general wish was expressed by the Members of
 the Council that I should not ascend to heights exceeding 4 or 5 miles. To
 this I readily consented, because for the most part, from the preceding experi-
 ments, aU the observations above 5 miles could have been inferred from those
 made below 5 miles ; and there was another reason, that the balloon, after
 the many rough descents, had become, in Mr. CoxweU's opinion, too unsafe

  for exti'eme high ascents.
     I have therefore no report to give upon any extreme high elevation

 attained during the past year, yet new facts and new physical conditions
 have become known in some of the nine ascents upon which I have to speak.
                                                                                                                                            --;

on nine balloon ascents in 1863 and 1864.                                                                                                   195

                                 § 1. Insteuminxs and Apparatus.

   The instruments used were for the most part the same in construction with
those of the two preceding years, consisting of mercurial and aneroid baro-

meters ; Daniell's and Eegnaidt's hygrometers ; maximum and minimum ther-

--mometers, blackened bulb thermometers,, both fi-ee and enclosed in vacuum

tubes ; Herschel's actinomcter ; all these instruments have been frequently

in the hands of Mr. Zambra, who superintended their replacement when

broken, and their perfect order at all times ; two spectroscopes, one lent by
the Astronomer Eoyal, the other by Mr. Simms ; a magnet for horizontal
vibration ; large caoutchouc bags, furnished by Professor Tyndall, for collect-

ing air at high elevations, ozone-papers, &c.
   In all the highest ascents both a mercurial and an aneroid barometer (the

one which was used on the ascent of September 5, 1862), and which was
found to read in close accordance with the merciu'ial barometer to very low
readings, were used; in the ascents to moderate elevatioiLs, the same aneroid
was used alone, it being examined both before and after the ascents, with
the mercurial barometer, and occasionally with the mercurial barometer when
placed ia an exhausted receiver under an aii--pump.

                                 § 2. Observing Aeeangements

Were precisely similar to those in previous years ; viz. in the high ascents,
a board was placed across the car which carried the several instruments, so

placed as to be readily read by myself, seated at one end of the ear, with my

face towards Mr. Coxwcll ; in the other ascents, when a smaller number of

iiistruments were used, they were placed upon a board projecting beyond the

car, casUy read by myself standing at one end, with my back to Mr. Coxwell.

Circumstances of the Ascents, and General Observations,

The ascents to April 6 were made by the same balloon as all the preceding

ascents ; those on June 13, 20, and 27 by a new and larger balloon, and that

on August 29 by the old balloon.

 --Ascent from NeivcastJe, Aur/ust 31, 1863. The situation of Newcastle, as

regards the Tyne and the sea, is such as to cause anxiety in respect to any

balloon ascent from there.

   The balloon left the earth at 6'' 12" p.m. ; the wind was North ; in 4
minutes we were over the High-Level Bridge, at an elevation of 1800 feet

we passed over Gateshead at 6^ 21"', being ] mile from the earth, and in

10 minutes afterwards the height of If mile was reached.
   "We continued nearly at this level for some little time, and then began our

downward journey                                                                        passed  into  cloud at 6^ 54" at the height of  1600 feet,
                                                                                     ;

out of it at 1800 feet, in cloud again at 2000 feet, then turned to descend,

passing again through clouds at 1900 feet. At 6'' 57"" we saw Durham

Cathedral, and reached the ground at 5 minutes past seven at Pittingtou,

near Durham.

The colours of the clouds observed in this ascent are very remarkable :

   At 6'^ 32" 30", at 7912 feet high, the colours of the clouds in the east oppo-

site to the sun were as foUows : the upper layer brown ; next below bluish

black, then a darker bluish black ; lower stUl, a thin layer of white cumulo-

stratus, next a greenish brown resting on uniform white rocky clouds.
   At 6" 35" 30", at 7329 feet, the colours of the clouds in the west, or under

--the sun, were as foUows : the upper layer was brown, the second dark blue,

                                                                                                                                        o2

·under which was a whitish-greyish black resting on uniform white rocky

cumuhis clouds.
   At 6^ 37" 10% at the height of 6981 feet, the colours of the clouds in the

--south were : the top layer brown, under which was bluish brown, then

rocky-brown cumulostratus, below bluish black resting on a base of rocky

cumulus.

At 6'' 43'", peaks after peaks, apparently rising up to our level, and clearly

defined against the sky ; cloud with a little red in it not opposite to the sun.

   At 6" 54TM 10% at the height of 1580 feet, colours of clouds were as follows :

--top layer deep greenish blue ; next bluish black, below green rocky clouds,

then slightly rocky cumulus clouds.

 --Ascent from Woherham^jfon, Septemher 29, 1863. The gas used on this

occasion was specially prepared in the mouth of July, as a high ascent was

arranged to have taken place before the Meeting of the Association last year,

but circumstances prevented it, and the Directors of the Gas Works had most
obligingly devoted a gasometer to our use from July to September, much to

their own inconvenience.

The balloon was filled the preceduig day, and watched all night. On

leaving. Lord Wrottesley quietly said, " Beware of the Wash," at the same

time pressing my hand, and repeating, " Beware of the Wash ; I fear that is

Weyour direction."  left the earth at 7'' 43TM a.m. with a cloudy sky and a

south-west wind. At 7'' 5>2"', at the height of 3000 feet, the sun's disk was

seen, and the earth was obscured by mist.

   At S** 4TM, at the height of 6000 feet, clouds were situated both above and
below; at 8'' 18TM, at the height of 8200 feet, there were two layers of clouds

below us, and very dense clouds stiU far above.

  When at 11,000 feet clouds were stiU a mile higher; there was a beau-
tiful sea of cloud below mth a blue tinge over its surface, and the peeps of

the earth as seen through the breaks in the clouds were beautiful, having a

purple hue ; when at 13,000 feet, clouds were still at a higher elevation, and

after this they began to dissipate ; and at 9'' 38TM, at 14,000 feet, the sun shone

brightly, and we thought we might gradually approach a height of 5 miles,

and remain in the higher regions tiU after noon, so that I might make a series

of actinometer and blackened bulb observations ; but, to our deep regret, at
gh 48^ -^e found ourselves moving directly for the Wash, as seen through a

break in the lower clouds, at an estimated distance of 10 mUes only, and we

were compelled to begin om- descent ; at 10'' 19TM, at the height of 3000 feet,

we saw by the benrling of the trees that a gale of wind from the south was
blowing on the earth, and we had a rough descent, being drawn over hedges,

across fields and ditches ; indeed so strong was the wind that the balloon was
torn from top to bottom, and was very much injured, but it was only by the

almost destruction of the balloon that its course was stopped ; we ourselves                          I

escaped with slight injuries.

 --Ascent from the Crt/stal Palace, October 9, 1863. The balloon left the

Crystal Palace at 4" 29TM p.m. ; in 4 minutes it was 2500 feet high ; at 4'' 46"

was 7300 feet, and directly over London Bridge, at which height with one

glance the vast number of buildings comprising the whole of London covdd be

seen, some so plainly that the plans of their inner courts could have easily been

drawn ; in this situation it was difficult to persuade oneself that that small
building directly imder us was the Cathedral of fit. Paul's ; we then gradually
descended to 2300 feet at 5" 15TM, ascended to 3600 feet by 5'' 24TM, and de-

scended again  to  1500 feet by  5'' 36'"                      ascended  to  8600  feet  by 6'', and

and Bedford.

 --Ascent from WoolwicJi Arsenal, Januarij 12, 1864. The Secretary of

State for War, the Right Hon. Earl de Grey and Eipon, having kindly granted

permission to the Committee of the British Association to avail themselves of

the facilities afforded in the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, for future balloon

ascents for scientific purposes, the ascent took place from there. The ascent

was intended to have been made on December 21, the day of the winter

solstice, and from this time to the end of the year the balloon was frequently

partially inflated                                                                      on December 30 it was fiUed, but its completion was at too

wind arose at night, and it was driven against a gasometer, and so injured as

to require repairing, and it was not tiU January 12 that we succeeded.

    The balloon on this day left the earth at 2'' 7"" p.m. ; in 3 minutes the

height of 1.500 feet was attained                                                                                                                                       at 2" 14TM we crossed the Tilbury Railway

3000 feet was reached ; the first mile was passed at 2'> 32TM, the second at
3" 24TM, and the height of 12,000 feet was attained by S^ 31TM. The balloon

then began to descend and touched the ground at 4'' 10TM, at Lakenheath
Warren, near Brandon, the descent not having taken one-half the time of

ascent.

    On the earth the wind was S.E. ; at the height of 1300 feet we entered a

strong S.W. cm-rent ; we continued in this current tiU we reached a height

of 4000 feet, when the wind changed to the south                                                                                                                                                                                                               and after some little time

we determined upon ascending. At the height of 8000 feet the wind changed

to  S.S.W.                                 at  the                                      height  of   4000                                                               feet  the  wind                                                                        changed  to  S.S.E. ;  at
                                        ;

11,000 feet we met with fine granular snow; passed through snow on de-

scending till we were within 8000 feet of the earth ; entered clouds at 7000

feet, and passed out of them at about 6000 feet into mist.

   Ascent from Woohuicji Arsenal, April 6, 1864.--This ascent was intended
to be made as near March 21 as possible; but although frequent attempts
were made, it was not till April 6 that we succeeded.

    The balloon left Woolwich on this day at 4^ 7TM p.m., with a south-east

wind                      in  9            minutes, when                                    at  the height of                                                                 3000 feet, we                                                                    crossed  over the  River
                       ;

Thames, ascending very evenly at the j-ate of 1000 feet in little more than 3

minutes, till 11,000 feet was attained at 4^ 37TM, and descended at about the
same rate tiU within 1500 feet of the earth, when the rapidity of the descent
was checked, reaching the ground at 5^ 25TM, on the outskirts of a pine plan-

tation in Wilderness Park, near Sevenoaks, in Kent.

   Our course in this ascent was most remarkable ; having first passed over the
River Thames into Essex, we must have repassed and moved in a directly

opposite direction, and continued thus till we approached the earth, when we

again moved in the same direction as at first.

   After the great injuiy to the balloon on September 29, in addition to the

numbers of repairs that it had previously needed, it was not, when again

repaired, in such a condition as (in Mr. CoxweU's opinion) to be quite safe

to ourselves for extreme high ascents; and after those of January 12 and

April 6, having been made at a time of year that any balloon would be most

severely tested, Mr. Coxwell determined, before venturing again with myself

to any great elevation, to build a new balloon.

   This he did, and one of a capacity capable of containing 10,000 cubic feet
more than the old one, so that, if need be, two observers could ascend to-

gether to the height of 5 miles.

  A new balloon, however, needs trying in low ascents till it proves to be          I

gas-tight, before it can be used for great elevations.

  --Ascent from the Crystal Palace, June 13, 1864. On this ascent the balloon

left the grounds of tJae Crystal Palace at 7 o'clock. The sky was cloudless,
and the air perfectly clear, excepting in the dii-ection of London.

   An elevation of 1000 feet was reached in 1^ minute; 3000 feet was at-

tained at T** 8TM, when the balloon turned to desceud, and passed down to 2300
feet by T*" 13'" ; on reascending, 3400 feet was gained at 7^ 20TM ; after taking
a slight dip, it again ascended to 3550 feet (the highest point) by 7*" 28" ; then
descended to 2500 feet, and after several small ascents, began the downward
journey at 7'' 50" from the height of 2800 feet, reaching the ground at East

--Horndon, 5 miles fi-om Brentwood, at S"" 14".
    Ascent from Derhi/, Jane 20, 1864. The balloon left Derby at 17 minutes
past 6"^ p.m. ; at G" 30" the height of 1000 feet was reached, the next 1000 feet
being passed in half a minute ; then ascended less rapidly ; cloud was entered
at 6" 26", 3600 feet being gained, and 4000 feet at 6'' 30" ; descended to
2700 feet by 6** 36", being over Ilkeston ; Ifottingham^ and its race-course
were visible at 6*^ 41" ; we then reascended to 4300 feet at G^ 50" ; on de-
scending, passed over Southwell at O"" 56", and touched the groimd at 7'' 16"

on a farm at Norwell Woodhouse, near K^ewark.

  --Ascent from the Cri/stal Palace, June 27, 1864. The balloon left the

grounds of the Crystal Palace at 6"^ 33|" ; the sky was cloudy, and the wind

was blowing from the West.

   At 6^" 38", when 1000 feet fi-om the earth, we crossed over Penge, reached
1500 feet high at 6'' 43", descended to 800 feet by 6"^ 48", being over Short-
lands ; ascended to 1200 feet by 6'' 52", being over Hayes Common ; remained

at about this elevation for 8 minutes, descended about 300 feet, and then as-
cended to 4200 feet by 7^ 16" ; descended 1000 feet slowly, and reascended.
to the height of 5000 feet by 7^ 42" ; began to descend, passing over the Ictt

of Tonbridge, near the village of Hudlow, and over the Medway on reaching
2400 feet at S^ 8" ; we then ascended 1200 feet, andTaegan to descend again
at 8^ 15", passing between Hawkhurst and Cranbrook ; were within 600 feet
of the earth at 8'' 55", being nearly over Teuterden ; we then reascended,

and in 13 minutes had attained an elevation of 6000 feet, and reached the
earth at 9"^ 21" in llomney Marsh, about half a mile fi'om Cheyne Court,

4 miles from Lydd, and 5 miles from the coast.
    These several trial trips of the new balloon were made, and it had gradu-

ally become gas-tight, and capable of any work reqidred, when at Leicester,
 I regret to say, it was destroyed with all its appurtenances.

    One would scarcely beheve it possible that such an act could take place in
the centre of England in the present day, but it was so destroyed, and eflect-
ually stopped all the preaiTanged experiments. The Mayor of Leicester has

presided over meetings for the purpose of collecting subscriptions to assist

Mr. Coxwell to rebuild a new balloon, which I hope will help to remove the
stigma now resting upon Leicester ; and I trust the Foresters will also help
to remove the stain now resting upon them ; for if not the act of the Foresters

 themselves, it was at one of their gatherings, under their supeiintendence,
 and the destruction of the balloon was not, so far as I can learn, attempted

to be stopped by those Foresters present.
    !Mr. Coxwell then had recourse fb the old balloon, which he had repaiix'd as

 best he could, and the next and last ascent of which I have to speak took place.

  --Ascent from the Crystal Palace, August 29, 1864. At 4' 6" 30' the balloon

 rose from the Crystal Palace, passing the first 3000 feet in 4 minutes, after

                                           § 3. Description of the Table of Observations.

    All the meteorological observations taken during the ascents axe contained
in Table I.

   Column 1 contains the times at which the observations were made. Column
2 contains observations of the siphon barometer corrected for temperature and
index error. Column 3 contains the readings of the thermometer attached
to the barometer. Column 4 contains the readings of an aneroid barometer.
Column 5 contains the height above the level of the sea, as reduced from the
barometric readings in column 2 on the days the siphon barometer was used,
and from column 4 on other days, by the formula of Baily, checked at inter-
vals by that of Laplace, which is as follows :

where Z is the height required, and h, h', t and t' the height of the barometer

corrected for temperature, and the temperature of the air at the lower and

Lupper stations respectively, the latitude. The temperature of the air for the

position of the balloon has been derived from the readings in column 10,
when such have been taken, otherwise from column 6. Columns 6 to 9

contain the observations with the dry- and wet-bulb thermometers free,

and the deduced dew-point. Column 10 contains the readmgs of a

gridiron thermometer. Columns 11 to 14 contain the observations with

the diy- and wet-bidb thermometers aspii-ated, and the deduced dew-

point. Columns 15 and 16 contain the direct dew-point observations mth

DanieU's and Regnault's hygrometers. When mmabers are entered in

columns 15 and 16 with " no dew" affixed to them, it is meant that the

temperature of the hygrometer has been lowered to the degree stated, but that

no dew has been deposited. Column 17 contains the readings of a very deli-

cate blackened bulb thermometer fully exposed to the sun's rays.

The Astronomer Eoyal had observations made every 10 minutes at the

Eoyal Obsei-vatorj^, Greenwich, on five days of ascents ; Lord Wrottesley had

observations made by Mr. Hough at Wrottesley Observatory on the ascent

from Wolverhampton ; E. J. Lowe, Esq., had observations made at Beeston

Observatory for the ascents at Wolverhampton and Derby                                                                                                                                                                                                           and observations

were made at my house at Blackheath by Messrs. Yair and Howe on June 27

and August 29.

   In calculating the height of the balloon, the observations made at the Philo-
sophical Society's Rooms, Ifewcastle, have been employed for August 31 ·
those at Wrottesley for September 29 ; those at the Eoyal Observatory for
October 9, 1863, January 12, April 6, June 13, and June 27, 1864 j those
at Nottingham for June 20 ; and those at Blackheath for August 29, 1864.

   The height of Greenwich above the mean sea-level= 159 -feet.

   The height of Wrottesley above the mean sea-level=531 feet.

   The height of Newcastle above the mean sea-level=121 feet.

  The height of Nottingham above the mean sea-level =174 feet.

   The height of Blackheath above the mean sca-level=160 feet.

     § 4. Adopted Temperatures of the Air and Dew-Point, with Height,
              IN THE Fourteenth to the Twenty-second Balloon Ascents,

      From all the observations of the temperatm*e and of the dew-point in the preceding
   Tables, a determination was made of both elements, with the corresponding readings of the
   barometer and heights. Some of the numbers in the column for heights have been interpo-
   lated when either of these elements have been observed without a correspionding observation
   of the barometer. The numbers thus found are within brackets. The results are contained

    in the following Tables.

wet-bulb thermometer, have been adopted, without combination with similar

results otherwise derived, excepting only when the wet-bulb failed to act
either at times when the temperature of the air liad just descended below the
freezing-point, or just ascended above it, and when I have had occasion to

apply water to the wet-bulb at such times the dew-point as found from
either DanieU's or Kcgnault's hygrometer has been used.

             § 5. Vaeiation- of Tempeeature of the Ate with Height.

   Every reading of temperature in the preceding Tables, or the means of
smaU groups of readings when observations have been taken in quick succes-
sion, at about the same altitude, was laid down on a diagram ; all these
points were joined, and a curved line was drawn passing through or near
them, giving an e(]ual weight to every point, and such that the area of the
spaces between the original and adopted lines on one side of the adopted line
was equal to that of the spaces on the other side of the line. The curves
thus formed, for the most part, in the previous experiments have shown a
gradual decrease of temperature with increase of elevation, and a gradual in-
crease of temperature with decrease of elevation ; biit this was not the case
this year, and I have not been able to adopt any curves for January 12 and

April 6.

   On the other days of experiments, a curve of assumed normal temperatui-e

has been adopted, and by comparison between the results as read from this
curve, and the observations at the same elevations, the places and amount of
disturbances are shown in the following Tables.

   The numbers in the first column show the height in feet, beginning at the
ground and increasing upwards ; the numbers in the second column show the
interval of time in ascending to the highest point; the notes in the third column
show the circumstances of the observations ; the niimbers in the fourth and
fifth columns the observations and the approximate normal temperatures of the
air ; and those in the next column the difference between the two preceding
columns, or the most probable efl^'ect of the presence of cloud or mist on the

temperature, or of other disturbing causes in operation.

   The next group of columns is arranged similarly for the descent, and the
other groups for succeeding ascents and descents.

the temperature then gradually increased to 40° at 1000 feet; at 860 feet it
was 49°-8, and on descending to nearly 800 feet it was 50|° ; on reaseending

to 1000 feet it increased to 51°, but decreased to 50° at 2000 feet. The

balloon then turned to descend, the temperature increasing to 51° on passing

downwards to 1000 feet, the same temperature as in the last ascension, and

to 53|° on the ground.

of temperature after this was very slight, but it became too dark to read the

reached, or during the descent to the earth.

which it decreased pretty gradually to 33° when 4300 feet was reached ; a

warm cm-rent was then entered, and the temperature increased till 7500 feet

was attained, being of the same temperatui-e as has been experienced at
1500 feet high, viz. 40°, then decreased to 34° at 8800 feet, and then in-
creased slowly to 36|° at 11,000 feet, a temperature which had been ex-
perienced at the height of 2170 feet in ascending.

   On descending the temperature increased about 5° in the first 1000 feet

remained at about that temperature till within 7000 feet of the earth, then
gradually decreased to 40° at 3000 feet, remained at about this point tiU
1500 feet of the earth, and then increased to nearly 46° on the ground. The
observed temperatures on this day are so remarkable that no adopted tem-
peratures have been made.

decreased more rapidly in the next 600 feet, and remained nearl}' stationarj^
during the following 900 feet, it being at 5000 feet rather more than 42°.

   On descending it slightly dedined in the first 300 feet, then increased slowly
till 2000 feet, after which it was nearly stationary till within 400 feet of the
earth, where it was 49°.

   On reascending it declined very slowly till 4000 feet was attained, it being

then 46°, after which it became too dark to read the thermometers ; this was
a matter of great regret, for the balloon passed above 6000 feet ; the tempera-
tare was found to be 46g° on the ground.

It is very clear from the numbers in the following Table, that they differ

very much from those in previous years, and that they cannot be combined, or

all used in deducing general laws. The ascent on August 31 was made in

the evening with a partially clear sky, and the results are somewhat abnormal.

+Some of the numbers in January 12 and April 6 are affected by signs,

circumstances never before met with ; on June 13, at sunset, no difference was

found within 2000 feet of the earth ; and those of Juue 20, made a Uttle before

sunset, and those of June 27, made a little before and after sunset, aU seem

to differ from the general laws as found by experiments made when the sun

is situated at a good altitude.

The only experiments this year which can be combined with previous re-

sults are those of September 29 with a cloudy sky, those of October 9 and

August 29, mostly with clear skies.

It is certain from the numbers in this Table that there are at times, in the

higher regions of the earth's atmosphere, spaces subjected to great cold, and

others to considerable heat ; and from the notes made at the time of passing

through clouds, that there exist some clouds of very low temperature, and

some, as those of January 12, of high temperature.

The presence of such either cold or hot currents passing over the country

must play an important part in aU our meteorological phenomena, and must

exert a great influence upon our climate.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      .
   The numbers in columns 24 and 26 show the mean results from the experi-

ments of the year, the former when the sky was cloudy, September 29, and
the latter when clear or mostly clear, on October 9 and August 29.

The numbers in column 25 show the number of experiments upon which

each result in column 24 is based ; at heights up to 5000 feet these vary from

13 to 22, at 6000 feet and 7000 feet to 5 and 7, and to heights exceeding

7000 feet to 4, these having been made on two days only, viz. June 26 and

September 29, 1863, on which days the balloon was frequently enveloped in

fog and clouds to the height of 3 and 4 miles.

The numbers in column 32 show the total number of experiments upon

which the numbers in column 31 are based ; they vary from 7 to 17 up to the

height of 23,000 feet, and there can be but little doubt that the numbers in

column 31 are very nearly true, and approximate closely to the general law.
Above 24,000 feet the number of experiments are too few to speak confi-
dently upon them, but they are in accordance with the series below this ele-

vation.

The numbers in column 28 show the decrease of temperature at each 1000

feet increase of elevation with a cloudy sky, they differ from those in column

31, showing the decrease for the same space with a clear sky, the former being

smaller, the latter up to the usual height of the cloud plane, and are nearly

alike above that plane, but the observations of cloudy skies at heights exceed-

ing 5000 and 6000 feet, are too few to place great confidence in them.

In forming the last six columns of the following Table, no use has been

made of the observations taken on July 17, 1862, Aug-ust 31, 1863, January

12, April 6, June 13, 20, and 27 of the year 1864. The results on all those

days are abnormal                                                                    I defer studying the results on these days till I can com-
                                                                                  ;

pare them with some confidence with the general laws, which may be found

to hold good at times of the year at which they were made ; their study then

will be profitable, and probably fruitful in yielding valuable results.
   The numbei-s in column 30 show the average increase of elevation at every

1000 feet for a decrease of 1° with a cloudy sky ; from these we see that

up to 1000 feet the average space is 223, the space for each 1000 feet in-

creasing, till at 22,000 feet it requires more than 1000 feet for a change of

1° of temperature.

   Ill the liist column of Table IV. the same results are sliowu for clear, or
nearly clear skies, and tlie}- sliow that a change of 1° takes place for an average
increase of 162 feet ; this space gradually increasing to 1000 feet at 23,000

feet.

   By comparing the numbers in columns 30 and 33 together, the different

spaces required to be passed through for a decline of 1° of temperature in the
two states of the sky wiU be readily seen : up to 23,000 feet it is necessary

to pass through a much larger change of elevation with a cloudy sky for a

decline of 1° of temperature than with a clear sky.

the whole decrease of temperature from the earth to the different elevations ;
the results with a cloudy sky are as follows :

These results, showing the whole decrease of temperature of the air from

the earth up to 23,000 feet, differ very considerably from those with a clear

sky, to be spoken of presently. Tlie numbers in the last column show the

average increment of height for a decline of 1°, as found by using the tempe-

ratures of the extremities of the column above. To 1000 feet high the average

is 1° in 223 feet, increasing gradually to 1° in 445 feet at 23,000 feet.

These results, showing the whole decrease of temperature from the ground

to 30,000 feet, differ greatly, as just mentioned, from those with a cloudy sky.
   The numbers in the last column, showing the average increase of height for

a decline of 1° of temperature from the ground to that elevation, are all smaller

than those with a cloudy sky at the same elevation. Each result is based
upon at least seven experiments, taken at different times of tlie year, and up
to this height considerable confidence may be placed in the results ; they show
that a change takes place in the first 1000 feet of 1° on an average of 102

feet, increasing to about 300 feet at 10,000 feet ; in the year 1802 this space
of 300 feet was at 14,000 feet high, and in 1863 at 12,000 feet high, there-

fore the changes of temperature haTe been less in 1863 than those in 1862, and
also less in 1864 than in 1863 ; but the experiments have all been taken at

different times of the year.

   Without exception the fall of 1° has always taken place in the smallest

space when near the earth. To determine this space, and also the law of de-

crease near the earth, all the observations of temperature of the air up to 5000
feet were laid down on large diagrams, and a line was made to pass tlnough

them, giving equal weight to every observation ; the result at every 200 feet

was then read out, and in this way the next series of Tables were formed.

   The mimbers in the following Table differ very much from those in Table VI.

in the Reports for the year 1862 and ISG'6 ; in these the largest numbers were
those at the bottom of the column, and the smaller at higher elevations,
and a decrease of temperature with elevation was shown Avithout exception.

    In the following Table there are instances of departure from both those in-
dications, and other particulars which present aU the above numbers to be

combined with previous results.
    In the first remarks on Table III. at page 2G6, the decrease of temperature

as observed in the first 200 feet was no less than S° ; by the adopted curves
passing nearly through the observed temperatures, it gives 2^° decline in

each 100 feet near the earth ; these results seem doubtful ; they differ so much

from all others, that it seems likely that the readings were affected by the

presence of many persons near the car of the balloon before starting, or that

I have read the instruments Avrongly by 5° before leaving the earth.

   On January 12 (the only winter ascent in the series) the numbers are for
the first time affected by the sign--, showing an increase of temperature

with increase of elevation, and the numbers near the earth are smaller than

those at higher elevations.

   On April 6 the numbers are also anomalous as compared with those

previously obtained ; near the earth there was no change, and then a large

--change, and higher still some numbers are affected with the sign.

   On June 13, on descending at the time of sunset, it wUl be seen that there

was scarcely any change of temperature for 1500 feet.
   On June 20, on descending a little before sunset, the change was very

small, and very different from corresponding changes on the ascent an hour

before.

   On June 27 there seemed scarcely any change in temperature up to

3000 feet, at readings taken after sunset, and till it was too dark to read the

instruments.

   The results on none of these days can be used in deducing general laws.
The endeavour has been in the past year to take obseiwations at times in
the day and times in the year at which no observations had previously been
made, resulting in these very different results.

   The only days this year available for general combination are September 29,
from observations made between 8^ a.m. and 10*" a.m., with a chiefly cloudy
sky ; and the numbers in column 28 show the mean values at the different
elevations, and October 9 and August 29 for clear skies, and these results
are shown in column 30.

   The numbers in column 32 show the general mean from aU the observa-
tions with cloudy skies, as based upon the number of experiments as shown
in column 33 at each elevation, and these vary from 19 to 29.

   The numbers in column 35 show the results for clear or nearly clear skies,
as based on the number of experiments as shown in the column 36, varying
in number from 8 to 12.

   In column 34 the space in feet is shown for an increase of 1° with cloudy
skies, varying from 167 feet near the earth to 334 at heights exceeding 3000

feet.

   In column 37 the same results are shown for clear skies, being 143 feet
near the earth, gradually increasing to 334 feet at heights exceeding 1600

feet.

    All the adopted readings of the temperature of the dew-point in. Section 4

were laid down on diagrams, and joined bylines drawn from one to the other.
In the case of the temperature of the air, when thus joined, a curved line can

be di-awn through them, giving equal weight to every observation, but tliis
cannot be done with respect to the temperature of the dew-point, it being far
more variable than the temperature of the air, and the numbers in the fol-

being 17°, "which nearly gradually declined to 13° by the time 3000 feet 'was

gained. On descending the temperature was found to be nearly the same at
2300 feet as it was at 3000 feet ; the difference at the lower of these eleva-

   The numbers In this Table show, as in all the previous experiments, that
the moisture of the air at the same elevation is very different at diiferent
times ; and that on the same day the moisture is very differently distributed,
there having been on some of the days of experiments several successive "wet
and diy strata placed one above the other.

   The numbers in the last columns show the average results at the different
elevations, in the two states of cloudy and clear skies, and the number of ex-
periments upon which each result is based.

   By combining those with a cloudy sky with those previously obtained,
according to the number of observations upon which each value was based,

the followiag results were obtained :

   The law of moisture here shown is a slight increase from the earth to the
height of 3000 feet, and then a slight decrease to 6000 feet, the degree of
humidity being at this elevation nearly of the same value as on the ground.
From 6000 to 7000 feet there is a large decrease, and then an almost uni-
form decrease to 11,000 feet; it increases from 12,000 to 16,000 feet, and
then decreases. The number of experiments up to 11,000 feet vary from 10
to 35, and I think great confidence may be placed in the results to this ele-
vation ; but at heights from 12,000 feet the number of experiments are evi-
dently too small to speak -with any confidence in respect to the results.

   By treating the results with a clear or a nearly clear sky in the same way,

the following results were obtained.

   The law of moisture here shown is a slight increase to 1000 feet, a con-
siderable increase between 1000 and 2000 feet, a nearly constant degree of
humidity from 2000 to 5000 feet, and a gradual decrease afterwards to 12,000
feet ; at greater heights the numbers are less regular. The results wp to
11,000 feet are based upon experiments varying from 10 to 23, and are most
likely very nearly true normal values ; at heights exceeding 12,000 feet the
n\unber of experiments have varied from 1 to 8, and no great confidence can
be placed in them.

   By comparing the results from the two states of the sky, the degree of
humidity of the air up to 1000 feet high is 15 less with a clear sky than with

a cloudy ; from 2000 to 5000 feet it is from 4 to 6 less ; at 6000 feet the air
with a clear sky is much drier than at 5000, but with a cloudy sky it is
nearly of the same degree of humidity, so that the difference between the two
states is large, amounting to no less than 11 ; tliis difference decreases to
at 9000 feet, but increases to 4 at 11,000 feet ; at heights exceeding 11,000
feet the air with clear skies generally becomes veiy dry, but with cloudy skies
frequently becomes more humid, as was to be expected from the fact of the
presence of clouds at heights exceeding 3 and 4 miles.

   In both states of the sky at extreme elevations the air becomes very dry,

but, so far as my experiments go, is never free from water.

enable us to speak -witli confideuce ; the results are that the temperatures of
the dew-point, as found by the use of the dry- and wet-bulb thermometers

and my Hygrometrical Tables, are worthy of full confidence up to this

point. At heights exceeding 7000 feet, the three years' experiences do not
yield a sufficient number of experiments to give satisfactory results. Before
we can speak with certainty _at these elevations more experiments must

be made.

On September 29 the balloon left Wolverhampton at 7"" 43TM a.m., and fell

near Sleaford, a point 95 miles from the place of ascent, at 10'' 30"' a.m.

During this time the horizontal movement of the air was 38 miles as regis-

tered at Wrottesley Observatory.

On October 9 the balloon left the Crystal Palace at 4" 29"' p.m., and de-

scended at Pirton Grange, a point 35 miles from the place of ascent, at 6'' 30°'

p.m. Robinson's anemometer during this time registered 8 miles at the Royal

Observatory, Greenwich, as the horizontal movement of the air.

On January 12 the balloon left the Royal Arsenal, "Woolwich, at 2'' 8" p.m.,

and descended at Lakeuheath, a point 70 mUes from the place of ascent, at

this time the motion of the air was 6 miles only.

On April 6 the balloon left the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, at 4'' 8"' p.m.

Its correct path is not known, as it entered several different currents of air,

the earth being invisible owing to the mist ; it descended at Sevenoaks, in

Kent, at 5'' 17'" p.m., a point 15 miles from the place of ascent. 5 miles was

registered during this time by Robinson's anemometer at the Royal Observa-

tory, Greenwich.

On June 13 the balloon left the Crystal Palace at 7'' 0"^p.m., and descended

at East Hornden, a point 20 miles from the place of ascent, at 8'' 15°' p.m.

Robinson's anemometer during this time registered 17 mUcs at the Royal

Observatory, Greenwich.

On August 29 the baUoon left the Crystal Palace at 4'' 6" p.m., and de-

            DREDGING ON THE COAST OF SHETLAND,                                                                                       327

            Further Report on Shetland Dredgings.

                 By J. GwYN Jeffreys^ F.R.S.

AThe dredging-expedition this year occupied nearly three months.                                                                     relation

lent me his yacht, and I had every reason to be satisfied with the master and

crew, who did all in their power to promote the object of the expedition.

The master had beeia my dredger on the last occasion ; and I this time en-

gaged in that capacity Archibald MclN^ab, of Inverary, who had formerly been

employed by the late Mr. Barlee and myself in dredging on the west coast of

Scotland and that part of Shetland which we now visited. McNab c\-idently

took a great interest in the work, and I cannot speak too highly of his conduct.

I had also extra hands to assist in dredging. Mr. Waller and Mr. Peach

were my companions ; and both most ably and zealously cooperated with me

in this last investigation of the marine invertebrate fauna of the Shetland

Isles. The cost of the expedition (exclusive of travelling and personal ex-

penses) was about ^220, towards which .£75 was granted by the Association,

WeBut the weather was, as usual, unpropitious.                                                                                       found, to our disappoint-

ment, that in this year the beginning of May was fine, and that time we just

missed. The rest of May and all June were more or less stormy. The second

week in July was more favourable than any other part of the season. The

variability of the weather in this district is very great, and no year is aUke

in that respect. The fishermen say that they never could depend on any

particular month in previous years as the finest or best suited for their

work ; and they told me that this season was the worst they had experi-

enced for the last twenty years. However, we continued to get some

dredging (on an average one or two days in each week) ; and altogether we
were not unsuccessful, owing in a great measure to having so much time

at our disposal. The stations which we revisited this year, and made our

head-quarters, were the ^\Tialsey Skerries and Balta, both exceedingly well

adapted for the exploration of the eastern side of the Shetland sea-bed. It

would of course be desirable to explore also the western side, although that

has partially been done by Mr. McAndrew. Perhaps he, or some other zoolo-

gist, wUl at a future time complete this part of the investigation.

The most interesting species of MoUusca obtained on this occasion were

Kellia cycladia, Trochus amabilis, Margarita ehgantula, Rissoa Sarsi, R. Jef-
fregai, Eidima stenostoma, Ceritliiopsis costidata, Nassa haliaeti, Mangelia niva-

lis, Cylichna alba, a new species of Amphisphyra (which I propose to call

expansa and will presently describe), Clio retusa, and C. infundibulum. The

JYassa haliiieti is described and figured in Hornes's valuable monograph on the

miocene shells of the Vienna Basin, under the name of Columbella corrugata,

Bonelli, who seems to have considered it the same as the Buccinum corruga-

tuni of Brocchi. I do not know Bonelli's work ; but the Buccinum corrugatum

of Brocchi (' Conchiologia fossile Subapennina,' tom. ii. p. 652, tab. 15.

fig. 16) is certainly not our shell. Brocchi refers his species to the

Buccinum stolatum of Renier, an Adriatic shell, which the latter mistook for

the species of that name described by Gmelin, and which is a native of Tran-

quebar. Our species does not belong to the genus Cithara of Schumacher,

as I had at first supposed ; but it is remarkably interesting as being identical

with a miocene species, which has not reappeared or been detected in the

pliocene formation, and therefore might naturally be supposed to have become

extinct. I lately took an opportunity of showing both the recent and fossil

shells  to  Mr. Henry Adams                                                                                                and  his  skilful and practised eye could not detect
                                                                                                                        ;

any difference between them.
328 REPORT--1864.

   Isocardia cor, Natlca monilifera, N. sordida, and Defrancia gracilis occurred
in a living state. These have been usually regarded as southern forms ; and
the last two are not in Loven's Catalogue. All are conspicuous and well-

known species ; and I havj selected them from many others in the same
category to show the wide range of their distribution. The first (^Isocardia
cor) is not uncommon in the newer glacial deposits near Christiania, and is

associated, with species some of which exist at present only within the arctic

circle.

   In one of my former Eeports I noticed that the marine fauna of Shetland

is in the main Scandinavian. This, indeed, would be the natural inference

from the geographical position of these isles. But it has undoubtedly also

a southern character, and includes many species which inhabit the Mediter-
ranean. Some naturalists, who appear not to have studied the question in

all its bearings, ascribe this southern element to the influence of the Gulf-
stream. I cannot help repeating what I have already urged elsewhere*, that

the eastern coasts of Shetland are, so far as can be ascertained, quite exempt

from the operation and effect of this mighty " river in the ocean." No seeds

of tropical plants, no lanthince, Sjjirula, exotic kinds of Teredo, Velella, or
other pelagic animals which usually accompany the course of the Gulf-stream
have ever bean found on any part of these coasts. The only driftwood which

--has been observed floating in the sea, or cast ashore by the waves and in
--this treeless district every kind of wood is much sought after consists of

Norwegian fir-trees, often with their roots, and drilled by the same species

of Teredo {T. megotara or nana) that attacks piles and fixed wood-work, as

well as boats, equally in the harbours of East Shetland and Norway. Besides,

another consideration must not be lost sight of, viz. that the Mediterranean

fauna is quite independent of the Gulf-stream ; and a glance at Maury's
chart will show that the direction of its course, or of the " drift " which

may have been mistaken for it, off the western coasts of Europe and

Africa (including the entrance to the Straits of Gibraltar) is entirely south-

ward, and forms in fact the return-current. The present distribution of
marine life in the European seas must be traced in some other way, and with

reference to geological conditions. Palaeontologists are well aware that many

kinds of Mollusca which stiU inhabit the Mediterranean, but not our seas,

left their remains on the area that now constitutes the eastern coasts of

England, perhaps at a period long antecedent to the origin of the GuK-stream.

Several species of Mollusca, which may be termed southern forms, likewise

occur on the Dogger Bank and the coasts of Yorkshire and Northumberland

and among them may be enumerated Trochus mlllegranus, t:<calaria Tvrtoni,

Natica sordida, Murex erinaceus, Defrancia brachiistoma, and Pleurotoma teres.

To these may be added a fine Echinoderra lately captured off Scarborough,

which had not before been observed so far north, viz. Echinus melo, var. Sar-

dica.  It is not uncommon in the south  of  Europe                                   but I believe it is only
                                                                                  ;

known as British through Mr. Peach having discovered it, some years ago, on

the Cornish coast.

    Other branches of marine zoologj^, in connexion with the Shetland dredg-

ings, have been worked out by skilful and experienced naturalists ; and when
I mention their names and the departments which they have undertaken, the
members of the Association wiU doubtless be satisfied thnt full justice has
been done to these explorations. Heports or lists wiU be presented by Mr.

Aider as to the Nudibranchs, Tunicata, and Polyzoa, by Mr. Spence Bate

a division of labour has, I think, had the effect of increasing the result, and
making the whole more complete and valuable.

  I have been enabled by means of this expedition to confirm my former ob-

servations, embodied in the last Report, with respect to the nature of the
sea-bed which has been thus explored, and to certain physiological and

geological conditions. To these may be now added some further remarks.
   More quasi-fossil shells were dredged, and for the first time in this district

ALepeta cceca, dead, but apparently as fresh as any Scandinavian specimen.

perfect specimen of Rhijmhonella psittacea was also obtained at a depth of

86 fathoms                                           but it  had two tell-tale associates.    One was Pecten Mandicus,
                                                  ;

and the other Spirorhis granulatus, var. heterostropha, of much larger size

than specimens of the same Annelid fi'om the southern coasts of England ; the

SpirorUs was also dead, and covered both the Rhijnchonella and Pecten. S.

granulatus has not been found in a living state north of the Hebrides, so

far as I have been able to discover. This appears to have been one of the

numerous relics of the glacial or post-glacial epoch ; it is an inhabitant of

shallow water, and affords another confirmatory proof of my hypothesis that

the Shetland sea-bed has sunk considerably during a comparatively recent

period.

It seems to me as if shells belonging to the same species, that are common

to the littoral and deep-water zones, attain a greater size and thickness

in the former than in the latter habitat. Such are Venus gallina, Tellina

fabula, Mactra solkla (compared with its variety elliptka), Tectum virginea,

Rissoa Alderi {E. soluta of Eorbes and Hauley, but not of Philippi), Trochus

zizyphinus, T.cinerarms, T. tumulus, and Buccinum undatum compared with its

variety Zetlandka. Mr. Jordan informs me that he has observed the same

difference with regard to specimens of Pandora incequivalvis and its variety

obtusa, Tectura virginea, and Chiton discrepans, which he has lately taken on

the shore and dredged off the Channel Isles. More extensive observations

are unquestionably desirable, if not necessary, before this proposition can bo

substantiated; but it has been abundantly proved by the researches of Di.
Davy, Porchhammer, and Bischof that the quantity of carbonate of lime held

in solution by sea-water, and from which shells are secreted, occui-s chiefly
along coast-lines, being derived from terrestrial sources, and brought down

to the sea by rivers, streams, and the washings of rain and waves. This
would give a reason for littoral shells being more solid than those from deep

water; and possibly the greater abundance of food in the former than in the

latter case might account for the increase of bulk.

   I noticed in the last Eeport that living Mollusca taken by the dredge
from considerable depths, and placed in a shallow vessel of water di-awn from

the shore, did not appear to be in the slightest degTee affected by the sudden
change of bathymetrical conditions. I wish to qualify this statement, and

at the same time to record a further observation. It is quite true that the

Mollusca in question were lively and active in their new habitat ; but those

which were of the univalve kind exhibited a peculiarity and habits with
which I was much struck. All of them, on being placed in the vessel, tried

to escape from the bottom, and quickly found their way up the sides to the

open  air            some                            floated  with  the  sole  of  the  foot  uppermost,       and the shell
                  ;

downwards. Now it is very certain that in their native habitat, at a depth

of nearly 500 feet, these mollusks, which are ground-dwellers and have no

means of rising to the surface of the sea, could not have floated in this way,

or even had time or an ojijiortunity, since they were taken up from the depths

of the ocean, to acquire such a habit. Was it instinct ? If so, when was

it implanted ? Another fact worthy of notice is the eagerness which they

displayed to escape out of the water and to breathe the open air. One would

have supposed that the water at the bottom of the ocean was much less

aerated or oxygenated than that on the shore, and that the mollusks would

have supplied their gills more copiously in surface-water with the requisite

element. But exactly the contrarj' has been ascertained by some experiments

conducted on board the Prench surveying-ship ' Bonite ' ; and it is now

clearly established that the quantities of atmospheric air increase with the

depth. According to Dr. Wallich, in an admirable chapter of his ' North

Atlantic Sea-bed,' entitled "The Bathymetrical Limits of Life in the Ocean,"

the proi)ortion of gaseous matter taken up bj water is very greatly increased

under an increase of pressure, all gases (especially oxygen and hydrogen)

being easily compressible and becoming fluid iiuder a comparatively slight

Wepressure.   but imperfectly understand the mode in which the solution of

atmospheric air in sea- water is brought about; but the tendency of fluids to

absorb gaseous bodies is constant under all circumstances, and the quantity

which they are capable of appropriating increases with pressure. It therefore

follows that the deeper the stratum of water, the greater mi;st be the amount

of gaseous matter held in solution by it. For a more detailed explanation of

this problem I must refer to the work above cited. I can now understand
why deop-water moUusks do not find in the surface-water the same supply
of atmospheric air as they had been accustomed to, and why they creep out

of it into the open au- to avoid a sensation which we should call stifling or

suffocation.

I ^vill conclude with extracts from the works of two great and pleasant

Wewriters, which relate to the subject-matter of this Report.  wiU first hear

Professor Edward Forbes :
   " I can speak personally as to the pleasure of such explorations, the more

to be esteemed since in these days there are few coimtries so entirely new as
to warrant the traveller's boast that he is the first educated man to visit
them and to discover their wonders. But beneath the waves there are many
dominions yet to be visited, and kingdoms to be discovered ; and he who

venturously brings up from the abyss enough of their inhabitants to display

the physiognomy of the country wiU taste that cup of delight, the sweetness

of whose di-aught those onlj who have made a discovery know." (' The

Natural History of the European Seas,' p. 11.)

   Professor Kingsley comes next and last. He says, with equal truth,

that there is a mysterious delight in the discovery of a new species ; but he

thinks "the pleasure is too gi'eat; that it is morally dangeroiis, for it brings

with it the temptation to look on the thing found as yovu' own possession, aU

--but your own creation ; to pride yourself on it, as if God had not known it

for ages since, as if all the angels in heaven had not been admiring it, long

before you were born or thought of." (' Glaucus,' p. 28.)

Habitat. Shetland, in muddy sand, 82 fathoms, fifty miles S.S.E. of the

Whalsey Skerries ; and on a sandy bottom called the " Haddock groimd,"

43 fathoms, at a distance of about five miles from the shore between the

Skerries and Fetlar Island. One living specimc a was dredged in each of

the",e peaces, and a dead shell also in the former; it appears, therefore, to be

a rare species. The animal is bold and active, and crawls rapidly. It diifers

from that of A. hyaVina in colour ; in the front lobes forming part of the foot

although it was examined in every position in order to detect their existence.

They could not have been subcutaneous, because the tissues of the animal

were nearly transparent, and a high microscopical power was employed, by

which the internal structiu'e was clearly seen. Analogous cases occur in
Eulima distorta and E. stenostoma, as well as in Mangclia nebula and M.

as almost to conceal the whorls. The kindness of Professor Loven in supply-
ing- me with, among other tjpes of his species, a specimen of A. (/lohosa has

enabled me to institute this comparison ; and I have also been favoured

by Professor Lilljeborg with a Norwegian example of the same species.
    With respect to the genus AmpMsjjhyra of Loven, I would take this

opportunity of remarking that Messrs. H. and A. Adams, in their well-known
' Genera of Recent MoUusca,' have substituted the name Diaphana, as having
been given bj' the late Captain Brown befoi'e the publication of Loven's
' Index MoUuseorum Scandinavite ' ; but on referring to the second and latest
edition of Brown'o ' Illustrations of the Eecent Conchology of Great Britain
and Ireland,' which bears the date of 1844, it wiU be seen that he cancelled
or discarded that name, and placed his Dicqihana Candida (our AmpMsphyra
hyalinci) in his new genus Utriculus, along with Cylichna obtusa and a fossil

species of Phil'mc.

    There are four British species of Amphisphyra, viz. A. hyalina, A. expansa,
and two others. One of these last I noticed and figured in the ' Annals and
Magazine of Natural History ' for January 1858, under the name of A. glo-
bosa, erroneously supposing it to be Loven's species. The name of the British

shell may be changed to ventricosa. The other is undescribed, and was found
by Mr. Eobert Dawson in sheU-sand from Haroldswick Bay, in the north of
Shetland ; it may be the Bulla denticulata of Adams.

In the coiu'se of the above mentioned dredging-operations on the coast of

Shetland, which were undertaken last year at the instance of the British

Association, I obtained two full-grown and living specimens of Stilifer

Tvrtonl, adhering to an Echinus Brobachiensis of 0. F. MiiUer, or E. neylectus

of Lamarck. The Echinus was also covered with numerous clusters of egg-

shaped spawn, which apparently had been deposited by one of the Stilifers.

    I will not say, as is too frequently said on such occasions, that nothing or

but little is known on the subject. This is not the case ; but I wiU endeavour

to add something to our knowledge of a curious mollusk, which is especially

interesting in respect to its peculiar structure and habits, as well as of the

diificulty felt by naturalists in assigning to it a correct place in the system of

conchology.

For the discovery of this mollusk science is indebted to the indefatigable

labours of the late Dr. Turton. In the ' Zoological Journal,' for October

1825, an article by him, entitled " Description of some new British Shells,"

comprised one which he named Phasianella sfylifera, and of which he

Wesays, "    found a dozen of these beautiful little shells aUve, and attached

to the spines of the Echinus escidentus, dredged up in Torbay." The reason

which he gives for placing it in Phasianella is singular. It is that, in order

to prevent the excessive multiplication of genera, he combined with that

genus many of the small turbinated shells, such as otherwise answer to

Lamarck's character, whether they have an oxjerculum or not ; and such as

have the margin of the aperture united all roimd he cast into the new genus

Cinr/idus, after Dr. Fleming.

This last-named author, in his ' History of British Animals,' included in

his genus Vclutina Turton's little shell ; but, after showing in what respects

it differed from Phasianella, not less than from Velutina, he suggested that

it should probably constitute a new genus, Stylina. That name, however,

had been pre-engaged twelve years before by Lamarck for a tropical genus

of stony Polypes, which he had originally called Fascicularia. Its adoption

for the Mollusk also would therefore be contrai'j to usage, especially as the
           DREDGING ON THE COASTS OF SHETLAND.                    333

somewhat similar name of StiUfer has no-w been recognized for upwards of
thirty years. I am aware that this is one of the questions of scientitic nomen-

clature upon which naturalists are by no means agreed. I do not pretend to

set myself up as a judge, and my opinion may be taken for what it is worth.

Mr. Broderip was the first to ascertain the zoological nature of the moUusk

now under consideration ; and in the ' Proceedings of the Zoological Society'

for 1832 will be found an admirable communication from him on the subject.

AHe there proposed the generic name which it stiU bears StiUfer.  more

detailed description of the animal from his pen wUl be presently given in

--fuU. The following remarks were appended to Broderip's memoir in the

' Proceedings of the Zoological Society :' " Mr. Owen, to whom Mr. Broderip

acknowledges himself indebted for the anatomical particulars which he had

recorded of StiUfer Astericola, subsequently exhibited a series of drawings of

the animal and of its various parts, so far as he had been able to observe

them in the specimens brought home by Mr. Cuming. He also read a more

detailed description of the peculiarities remarked by him during the dissec-

tion of the individuals which had been entnisted to him for that purpose."

Some such drawings are engraved in Sowerby's ' Genera of Recent and Possil

Shells,' and the different parts are designated by letters ; but, unfortunately,
no reference was published, except to one of the figures.

Soon afterwards appeared one of the jS'umbers of Sowerby's ' Genera ' con-

taining an account of the present genus, with the signature of Mr. Broderip.

The first syllable of the name StiUfer is here spelt (probably omng to a

printer's error) with a // ; in the ' Proceedings of the Zoological Society ' it

is correctly spelt with an i. The generic characters of the animal are as

follows :

   Pallium crnssura, camosum, cyatliiforme, testse anfractus ultimos obtegens.
Proboscis longissima, retractilis. Tentacula rotunda, crassa, subacuminata, ad
basin proboscidis posita. Oculi ad basin tentacidormn sessiles, minimi. Brancbise
stirps solitaria. Animal marinum. Asterife cutem penetrans.

 --After the English version of these characters, a few more particulars are

given, viz. that the mantle is of a green hue, and has a small aperture at
its base, and that on its ventral aspect is the rudiment of a foot. It is like-
wise mentioned that " Mr. Cuming found this elegant parasite burrowed in

different parts of the rays of the oral disk of Asterias Solaris. It is almost
hidden from sight, so deeply does the animal penetrate into the substance

of the Starfish, in which its make a comfortable cyst for itself, wherein it
most probably turns by the aid of its rudimentary foot. All the specimens
infested with StyUferi appeared to be in the best health. Though there is
reason to believe that they feed upon the juices of the Starfish, with that
instinct of self-preservation imparted to aU parasites, whose existence
depends upon that of their nidus, the StijUfer, like the Ichneumon among
insects, appears to avoid the vital parts ; for in no instance did Mr. Cuming
find it imbedded anywhere save in the rays, though some had penetrated at

their base, and very near the pelvis." I must confess that I am not pre-

pared to adopt this teleological mode of reasoning, so far as regards the

StiUfer ; because it does not appear that the Starfish has, in the calcareous

and solid parts inhabited by its so-called parasite, any internal juices or soft
tissue on which the latter can feed. The investing membrane is wholly
external. Although the above description of the animal was undoubtedly
correct and circumstantial, it must not be forgotten that it was drawn up
from specimens which had been preserved for a considerable time in spirits.
The examination of such specimens could not j-icld the same result, in a

scientific point of view, as that of living individuals in their native habitat.
--334 REPORT 1864.

   Our best British malacologist, Mr. Alder, is the only one who has noticed
the animal of S. Turtoni. The specimen which he examined was rather

injured, and in a very sickly state. He says, " It was white, had a rather

large foot, without operculum, and a rounded head with two cylindrical ten-

tacles, and minute eyes at the (external or posterior) base. ITo portion of the

shell was covered by the fleshy parts ; but we are not prepared to say that, in

a state of vigour, the animal has not the power of extending some part of the
mantle or foot over it. The remains of the animal, examined under a micro-

scope, did not show any denticulated tongue." (I may add, by way of paren-

thesis, that Mr. Alder has, within the last few days, examined the soft parts
of two more individuals which I sent him for that pui'pose, but faUed to

detect any traces of a spinous tongue.) He has also observed that "the

otolites are cireula---, with a central dot, that the giU consists of a single
series of triangular kbes, and that the mouth breaks up into squarish angular

fragments, not crystalline, perhaps horny,"

    In 1850, Mr. Arthui- Adams, one of the authors of a work so indispensable
to all students of general conchology (' The Genera of Recent MoUusca '),
published in the * Voyage of the Samarang ' some interesting details with
respect to the animal of another species of StiUfer. This species he named
;S. astericola, erroneously supposing it to be identical with the one described
by Broderip ; but afterwards, finding out his mistake, he substituted ovoideus
as the specific name of his StiUfer. His diagnosis is as follows :

    " Tentacles slender, subulate, simple. Eyes sessile at the outer bases of
            the tentacles. Mantle enclosed. Eoot hnguiform, forming an elon-

            gated anterior lobe, rudimentary behind."

    As will be presently seen, the animal of the European species dififers in
several respects from the above description. Its tentacles are thick, cylin-
drical, and more or less strangulated, instead of " slender, subulate, simple ;
the eyes are not placed " at the outer bases of the tentacles," but behind
them on the neck ; the mantle is always expanded over part of the shell
during the lifetime of the animal, and never " enclosed," nor is it even with-
drawn at its death ; and so far from the foot being " rudimentary behind,"

--it is weU developed, and peculiarly constructed. The animal of S. Turtoni

is, besides, ciliated all over a character which distinguishes it at once from
any species of EuUma, with which it has been iisuaUy associated in works

treating on the classification of the MoUusca. Perhaps this character may

have been hitherto overlooked.

  --Messrs. Adams, in their ' Genera,' added some further information as to

the habits of StiUfer
    " These singular animals are parasitic in the skins of Starfishes, burrowing

beneath the smface, and producing tumours often of a considerable size.

When removed and placed in water, they do not appear to possess much

locomotive power, but extend the tongue-shaped foot, and use it as an

exploring organ."

    The ' Journal de Conchyliologie ' for 18.51 contains a notice by M. Petit
de la Saussaye of the present genus, and a description of a new species, S.

Mittrei. He added nothing to our knowledge of the animal, but attributed

a greater antiquity than had been supposed to the discovery of StiUfer, in a

purely conchological point of view, by identifying HeUv coraUhm of

Chemnitz as the original species. Chemnitz says that he found a dozen
specimens of the shell, which he had thus provisionally named, in the crevices
of Madrepores and other stony corals that had been collected on the shore
of one of the West-India Islands for the purpose of being burnt into lim e
              DREDGING ON THE COASTS OF SHETLAND.  335

and that had formed part of the ballast of a vessel bound to Europe. As the
corals had lain on the beach for a long time, Chemnitz thought the shells

might have been terrestrial, and not marine. Mistakes of a similar kind

--have been made by modern conchologists e. g. Halia Friamus.

   M. Hupe, the able and courteous curator of the natural-history collections

in the Jardin des Plantes (whose knowledge of the recent Echinodermata is
very extensive), published in the ' Eevue et Magasin de Zoologie ' for March

1860 a description of another species, under the name of Stilifer Orlignyamis.

While examining a specimens of Ciduris imperialis, Lam., from New Holland,

he noticed that two of the spines were imusnally enlarged, tumid and irre-

gularly spherical; at their base he observed two small vertical shts, like

Abutton-holes, placed opposite to each other.  section of these spines

showed that in the cavity of one was enclosed an adult Stilifer, and in the

other, two specimens, which were also adult, besides several embryonic

shells. With respect to the mode by which the Stilifer had thus become
enclosed, M. Hupe was of opiuion that the cavities were not made by them,

but that the interposition of some part of the mollusk had prevented its being

completely imprisoned in the spine during the progress of the growth of the

Cidaris, which would otherwise have enveloped and smothered the Stilifer.

He was kind enough to show me the specimens ; and theyseemed to present

an analogous case to that of Stilifer astericola, which I had examined in

Mr. Cuming's collection.

Lastly, I would cite an excellent monograph by Dr. Fischer, which

appeared in the ' Journal de Conchyliologie ' for April last, on the genera

Stylifer and Entoconcha (p. 91 &c.). In this monograph aU the known
species of Stilifer are redescribed, and a new one (/S. Paulv^cice) well

described and figured. According to Fischer, the Entoconcha mirahilis of

J. MiiUer, found in Synaptce at Trieste, is probably the fry of some other

moUusk. At aU events, we want more information about it. It is almost

microscopic.

   But to return to Stilifer. Fischer suspected that it is not a true parasite.

He says that the discovery by M. Hupe proves that, although living like a

parasite on the tegumentary system of the Eehinoderms or their appendages,

the Stilifer does not feed on their substance, as has been supposed. Its

nourishment comes with the sea-water through the openings of the cavity

which it occupies : perhaps its proboscis may be protruded for the purpose of

seeking this noiu-ishment. I need not say that the reputation of Dr. Fischer

as a physiologist, especially with regard to the MoUusca, makes any opinion

of his on such subjects very valuable. I share his incredulity as to Stilifer

being a parasite in the ordinary meaning of the word ; but my impression

is that it feeds on the excretions of Eehinoderms, and not on animalcules

or other organized and living matter with which sea-water abounds. It

has never been found except on Eehinoderms, or imbedded in their rays or

spines. All the specimens of Stilifer Turtoni which I have seen in situ (and

they have been rather numerous) occupied the upper sides of Echini, in the

area of the vent or anal opening. The Echini so infested appeared to be

invariably in perfect health and vigour. The Shetland specimen of E. JDr'6-

bachiensis was carefully watched by me for more than twelve hours. Its

tubular suckers and pedicellarise continued in active although intermittent
motion during aU that period. The Stilifers were nestling or slowly crawling
about among the spines ; but they did not touch any of the suckers of the
Echinus, which, being retractile, could easily have been withdrawn into the

test ; nor could I detect either of the moUusks in the act of feeding on the
336 REPORT--1864.

outer membrane or any other part of the EcJiinus. At the same time it is clear

that there is some connexion between the pecuhar habitat selected by the

Stilifer and its food ; for if it subsisted on any living organisms, it would

hardly confine itself to Echinoderms, but have a more varied range of

habitat. Such shelter as an Echinus or Asterias could afford might be as

easily obtained in crevices of rocks or in the cavities of deserted shells. Con-

sequently, although I do not consider this a case of true parasitism, like

that of the mistletoe among plants, neither would I refer it to epiphytism,

like that of a tropical orchid. It rather reminds one of the scavenger-habits

of dung-beetles.

I have in another place* endeavoured to show that the pretty little bivalve

shell called Montacuta suhstriata, which also infests various Echinoids, is not

really a parasite. This always occupies a different part of the Echinus from

that where the Stilifer take up its abode ; it adheres by its byssus to the

ventral spines near the opening of the mouth on the under side. Here it

probably avails itself of the current or indraught excited by the ciliary action

of the Spatanr/tis or other Echinoid for its own purposes ; and both partake
of the same food in amicable but unconscious relation to each other. As

far as I have been able to observe, the Stilifer does not cause more inconve-

nience than the Montacuta to its not unwilling host.

The suctorial proboscis, as well as the want of a denticulated tongue in

Stilifer Turtoni, strengthens the supposition that its food consists of extremely

soft or semifluid matter, and not of organisms which have any degree of

solidity. Dentalium, which preys on Foraminifera and other minute animals,

has (according to Lacazc-Duthiers) a very complicated lingual apparatus

and even the little liissoa, which feeds on seaweeds, often of the most

delicate and filmy texture, possesses a pair of horny jaws and a tongue armed

with a strong central tooth, which is flanked on each side by a formidable

row of serrated lateral teeth. Stilifer has no jaw or tooth of any kind.

The late Mr. Stewart, of the College of Surgeons (whose untimely death

is still deplored by all who study the Eritish Echinodermata), was of opinion

that Stilifer Turtoni infested Echini for the sole purpose of depositing its

Wespawn.       know, from the observations of Mr. Peach, fhai Lamellctria per-

spicua frequents the shore at Wick, between tide-marks, every siimmer, and

makes a nidus for its spawn in a species of Botryllus. But Lcnnellaria is

not, like Stilifer, restricted to a particular habitat. The former attaches

itself to the iindcrside of loose stones, and is also found generally distributed

over the sea-bed, except perhaps in the spawning-season. The Echini on

which Stilifer Txhrtoni have been taken are very rarely covered with spawn :

and Stilifers of all ages, from one to half-a-dozen, occur on Echini, but

nowhere else.

The fecundity of Stilifer is very great ; and it therefore ought not to be a

rare shell. I counted at least one hundred fry in one of the clusters of spawn

on the back of the Shetland sea-egg ; and as there were 41 of these clusters,

--this would yield a prospective harvest of more than 4000 specimens enough

to supply almost all the conchologists in the world. Moreover one of the

adult Stilifers appeared to be full of spaAvn. As the Echimis probably could

not accommodate more than half-a-dozen Stilifers when they came to matu-

rity, what would have become of the rest, supposing any of them escaped

being the prey of other animals ? Would they migrate, and form colonies

on other Echini ? They have feet and eyes ; and suitable habitations are not

wanting in the same part of the sea-bed where I procured the specimens

which have given rise to the above remarks.

Various have been the positions which conchologists have, from time to

time, assigned to this remarkable mollusk in their systems of classification.

&H. A. Adams as a distinct family between Eulimidce and CeritJiiojJsidce

Clark in Pyramidellidce, between Aclis and Scalaria ; and Gray also in the

same family, between his genus Hyala {Rissoa vitrea) and Entoconcha. I

am inclined to agree with the Messrs. Adams in making Stilifer the type
of a separate family ; but it is much more difficult to say to what other

families it has the nearest affinity. Pyramidellidce, as represented in our

seas by Odostomia, ought not to be far separated from it ; and lanthinidce

have similar relations to it in respect of the nucleus or apex of the sheU.

Homcdogyra has sessUe eyes placed on the neck, as in Stilifer, but has no

tentacles ; and it is also finely cUiated all over.
   The presence or absence of an operculum is evidently not a character of

sufficient value to distinguish one family, or even one genus, from another,

seeing that some species of the same genus (e. g. Ifanyelia) possess an oper-

culum, while their congeners (although closely allied in aU other respects)

have none.

The stiliform character of the spire in this genus, although remarkable,

is not peculiar to it, or to Odostomia, Turbonilla (or Chemnitzia), EidimelJa,

or lanthina. Melampus bidlceo'ides has the apical whorls formed in the same

mamillated fashion ; and in several genera of Bidlida the shell exhibits the

same feature. These, however, may be regarded as cases of analogy rather

than of affinity. The nucleus of the spire, or first-formed whorls, in many

univalves ceases to be occupied by the animal after it has attained a certain

--growth, being too small for its requirements like a householder, who usually

moves, once at least during his life, into a tenement larger than the one he

at first inhabited. In the case of the MoUusca above referred to, the original
and now useless tenement remains fixed to the new one ; but in Bulimus decol-
latus, some species of Clausilia, and in TruncateJla truncatida the topmost story

is knocked off and replaced by a partition wall. Ccecum glahrum and G.

trachea even undergo partial metamorphoses, the shell of each having at first

a regular spire, and, when this is lost, becoming a slightly curved cylinder.

The genera Leptoconchus of Eiippell and Canvpidotus of Guettard {Magihts,

Montfort) also appear to be related to Stilifer in their quasiparasitic habits.

The first-named genus is destitute of an operculum, except in its younger

state ; the other has an operculum at aU ages (Deshayes, ' MoUusques de I'ile

de Reunion').

The conjecture of the late Professor d'Orbigny that Stilifer ought to

merge in Eidima, and that the latter may be also parasitic, has no founda-

tion. It is true that species of Eulima have been found in the stomachs of

Holothurite ; and the "trepang," or dried "beehe de mer," of which the

Japanese are so fond, frequently contains these shells. But this is not a

case of parasitism : the Eulima feeds the Holothuria, instead of feeding

upon it.

Let me say a few words as to the name of this genus and the European

species. Although the Greek orthography is followed in our word style, it

is clear that the Latin word stilus was not spelt with & y : it is from this
338 REPORT--1864.

latter word that SUlifer is derived. Whetlier it is correct to form a generic

name with an adjective may be very questionable ; but use has sanctioned

it in the present instance, as well as in Spirifer, Stiliger, Lohiger, lantliiiw,

Vitrina, and many other such names of general acceptation.

According to some purists, the specific name given by the discoverer, if

subsequently adopted as generic, ought to be retaiaed ; so that the Euro-

pean species would be Stilifer stUifer. Precedents are not wanting for such

a reduplication of the name under similar circumstances, e. g. Volva volva,
Tv/rricula turricida, &g. But it would be very inconvenient to alter the
specific name Turtoni, which is so familiar to aU conchologists, to say

nothing of the inelegance of this system of nomenclature, or of its being

contrary to one of the rules recommended by a committee of the British

Association,

This specific name has been spelt, too, in diiferent ways. "We have

Oaleomma Turtoni, Scalaria Turtonts, and not only Stilifer Turtoni of

Broderip, but S. Turtonii of Lovcn. The termination of the proper name from

which aU these originated is a Greek, and not a Latin, form ; and if it is to

be so declined, the genitive would be -is, with the penultimate syllable short,

as ActcBon, Actceonis; Alcmceon, Alcmceonis, &c.: so Turton, Turtonis. But

lectus of Lamarck to be the same species as the E. Drobacliiensis of MiiUer's

Prodromus to the ' Zoologia Danica,' it may be doubted whether the latter

species is noo the E. Flemingii of Ball. Miiller's description is "hemir-
sphsericus, pallidus, spinis longis, albis," which seems to agree better with
E. Flemingii than with E. neglectus.)

   The shell described bj Professor Macgillivray, in his ' Molluscous Animals
of Aberdeen, Kincardine, and Banff,' as Stylina stylifera, and stated to have
been found by one of his pupUs " adhering to an Actinia brought up by the
lines," was the young of a common West Indian laud shell belonging to the
Oyclophoridce. The habitat alone might have induced a suspicion that this

   Fischer also states that Stillfer Turtoni is not uncommon on Echinus

liviclus, near the mouth-opening ; but he cites no authority for this unusual
habitat. E. liviclus, as is well known, excavates holes in slate and g-neissic
rocks, within tide-marks, and its lower surface is pressed closely to the stone.

    Another instance of the same kind of mollusk infesting different Echinoids
is that of Montacuta suhstriata, which has been found not only on Spatangus
purpureus, but on S. mericlionalis,Amphicletus ovatus, Brissus lyrifer, Echinus
esculentus, and Ciclans hystrix.

   Besides the ahove, may be noticed an undescribed or unnamed species
dredged by Mi-. M'Andrew off the Canary Isles (if it is not S. Turtoni),

--another collected at Guadeloupe by M. Beau, and five more, bearing the

foUowing names, but without description, viz. Stilifer Broderipn, S. Cu~
mingii, S. fastigiatus, and^. soJidus of Adams's 'Genera,' andiS. pyramidcdis

of Mr. Eeeve. In the British Museum is an imnamed Stilifer from Port

Natal, said to have been found attached to the mouth of a Starfish.
   It is not improbable that some of the species enumerated in the 2nd sec-

tion, having an elongated spire, may belong to Eulima or Niso, instead of to

Stilifer.

   I am not aware of any fossil species having been discovered.

   I will now give the result of my examination of the animal of S. Turtoni,      I

from notes made at the time.

Body white, and delicately stippled; the whole of the upper surface is

       covered with microscopical and extremely short cUia, which are in con-
       stant motion ; these cilia are arranged in scale-like bunches, and by
        their action produce a circulating current.
Mantle thickened at its edges, and spread over the lower part of the shell,
        so as to form a disk.

Pallial fold, or branchial opening, on the right-hand side, forming a canal
       which terminates in an oval or roundish hole.

Head-lobes, rounded and flattened, nearly transparent, one on each side a
        little below the snout or mouth.

Snout rather long when extended, but usually folded inwards and trunli-

       like, slightly bUobed, and placed between the tentacles and the foot.
Tentacles club-shaped, somewhat compressed, thick, and rather long, some-

       times expanded at the tips, which are blunt and widely diverging,
       but united at their bases ; they are more or less strangulated or con-
        stricted, usually at about one-fourth of the distance from thcii- bases.
Eyes exceedingly smaU, seated on the neck or back of the head, at some
        distance behind the tentacles.
Foot tongue-shaped and elongated, bulbous and forming a creeping-disk in
       front, somewhat tubular in the middle, and tapering to a fine point
       behind ; the sole, or under part, is slit in the middle for more than
       three-fourths of its length, the opening or commencement of the sUt
       being near the bulbous part and oval.
Male organ spike-shaped, and resembling an auxiliary tentacle.

   Habitat. "^Tialsey Skerries, East Shetland, about 40 mUes from land, in

A80 fathoms, sandy bottom, on an Echinus Drohachiensis. pair of the Stilifer

were attached to the sea-egg on its upper surface, between the spines near
the vent or anal orifice ; and the same part was also covered with about forty
clusters of spawn, which appeared to be in various stages of development.
The adult Stilifers were not firmly attached to the Echinus (Hke the Caligus

to a codfish), but frequently shifted their places by creeping between the
spines. I gently removed one of them with a stiff camel's-hair brush, and
placed it in a glass tube with sea-water. It was at first very sluggish or
timid, and evidently unaccustomed to its new habitat, lying at the bottom of
the tube; but afterwards it recovered itself, and crawled up the side by
           DREDGING ON THE COASTS OF SHETLAND.  341

means of the front part of its foot, very slowly and by an imperceptible

movement ; the other part of the foot was not pressed to the glass, but rested
on the mantle. The foot was occasionally twisted about and contracted, as if

through iineasiness. The animal was never wholly withdrawn into the
shell, although I irritated it with that object. The slit in the foot probably

serves for the admission of water into some tubular cavity or vessels which

permeate this organ ; this would have the effect of enlarging and swelling

the foot, so as to protect the Stilifer from being crushed by the spines of the

AEchinus.  slight leverage or action of this kind at the base of the spines

would, of course, answer the piu'pose far better than a much stronger leverage

or power exerted at the top of the spines. The fry are enveloped in a gela-

tinous case. When detached and examined under a microscope, each had

three lobes, of which the two larger were in front ; these were finely eihated,

the cilia being rather long, and their points sometimes touching the surface

of the glass cell which contained the fry. The fry rapidly whirled them-

selves about by means of the ciha, but occasionally rested. They occupied

nautiloid shells of a single turn.

Oue of the StUifers appeared to be fuU of spawn-masses, which were per-

ceptible with the microscope by reason of the shell being transparent. The

other Stilifer was a male. I afterwards replaced the latter in its old

quarters, where it was evidently more comfortable than in the glass tube

and it soon adhered to the sea-egg by the prehensile lobe of its foot, and
settled down among the spines.

The cUiation of the body of Stilifer is also a characteristic feature of

Homalogyra (perhaps the living representative of Euomphalus), which is a

minute (but not microscopical) moUusk, without tentacles, and forms a

discoidal shell. It is an inhabitant of the European seas, and comprises two

species. Porbes and Hanley called one of these species Skenea nitidissima,

and the other Skenea rota. Dr. Fischer imagined that the first-named

species was the fry of some larger moUusk, because it was ciliated ; but he

must have either overlooked the fact, or else not have been aware, that in

all the species of Trochus, Bissoa, and other genera the tentacles are ciliated,

and also, in some species, other parts of the body. Mr. Clark was not more

happy in his conjecture that Homalogyra rota was the fry of Ccecum trachea,

the natui'al history of which this accomplished malacologist had so success-

fully investigated. I am not aware, indeed, that these shells or their animals
have any character in common ; besides which, it may be observed that the

operculum of Homalogyra is flat and paueispiral, with an excentric nucleus,

while that of Ccecum is more or less conical and multispiral, with a central

nucleus, as in Vermetus. (Since this paper was read, I have received from

the Marquis James Doria specimens of the young of C. trachea, which he

had dredged at Spezzia. The termiaal part or spire is very different from

that of H. rota.)

  The sexes in Stilifer appear to be separate, as may be seen from my

description of the animal of S. Turtoni,

   The shell of this species has been often described ; but I wiU briefly notice
some of its characters, which have not been satisfactorily stated. The spire,

for the fii'st three whorls, is cylindrical and narrow ; it then enlarges sud-
denly and disproportionately, and consists of three or four more whorls,
which are rounded and extremely ventricose or swollen. The apex or

nucleus of the spii-e is not reversed, although often set obliquely ; it projects
like the stump of a flagstaff which had been stuck in a slanting position on a

steep mound. The columellar lip, in adult and perfect specimens, is
3^3 EEPORT-- 1864..

slightly reflected. The lower part of the mouth is semicircular ; it is not
effuse or spread outwards, as iu Eulima or Aclis.

   I cannot conclude without acknowledging my obligations to Mr. Peach
for the diagram which has illustrated this paj^er, and to my old and worthy

friend Mr. Alder for the loan of an exquisite drawing of the animal of

Stilifer Turtoni, made by him a few years ago, and which fully confirms my

account of its organization.

--Report of the Committee on the Distribution of the Organic Remains
   of the North Staffordshire Coal-field. Preliminary Notice. By a
   Committee, consisting of Sir Philip de M. Grey Egerton, Bart.,
   M.P., F.R.S., Professor J. H. Huxley, F.R.S., and William
   MoLYNEux, F.G.S. (Reporter).

The great or Pottery coal-field of North Staftordshire is triangular in form,

the apex resting to the North between ridges of the Millstone-grits of Bid-

dulph Moor and Mow Cop, the base stretching out from Madeley on the
west to "Weston Coyney on the east, bordered by Permian and New Red

Sandstones, a distance of nearly ten miles. With this may be included the de-

tached measures of Cheadle, Chcddleton, "WetleyMoor, and the Roaches, the
whole comprising an area of upwards of eighty square miles. It is difficult to
determine the actual number of workable beds of either coal or ironstone
contained in these fields, in consequence of the lithological difference in the
measures of collieries distant from each other ; but notwith^anding this, it
appears tolerably certain that there are from forty-five to fifty workable
seams of coal 2 feet and upwards in thickness, and about half that number

which may be taken as of little or no commercial value, the whole constituting
a mass of about 180 feet of solid coal. With these are associated about twenty

workable bands of ironstone, and numerous others of inferior quality and
local range, but interesting from the character of the organic remains they
are generally found to contain.

   The base of the series is a somewhat remarkable band of hoematite resting
immediately upon (or separated by an ii-regidar deposit of yellowish clays from)
the Upper Millstone-grits of Ipstones and the Churnet valley. There is a tra-
dition that this ore was worked by the Danes 800 years ago ; and this opinion
is strengthened by the fact of the stone having been extensively worked
along the sides of the Churnet valley at a time (of which no other record
exists) previous to its rediscovery by a Coruish miner, named Bishop, within
the last few years. Many thousands of pounds have been lost in the fruitless

msearch for this stone outside the basin which it appears to be confined, and

efforts are stiU being made to reach it iu the neighbourhood of CeHarhead
and Wetley Moor. From this to the uppermost of the unproductive beds
of the coal-field, the measiu'es represent a thickness of nearly 5700 feet,
and to the work of collecting and tabulating the organic remains of this enor-
mous thickness of strata, grouped over an area of eighty square miles, the
last two years have been principally devoted ; but it will require another
year at least to prepare satisfactory tables of the distribution of the fish and
shells of which the field contains such varied and interesting examples.

   Pre-vious to last year but one instance was known of the occurrence of
marine shells in other than deposits belonging to the lower, or lowest mea-
sures of this field. The exception consists of the discovery, about five years

ago) of Discinge in a nodule of the Priors-field ironstone, which lies near the
NORTH STAFFORDSHIRE COAL-FIELD ORGANIC REMAINS.  343

base of the thick ironstones of the middle measures ; but the circumstance was
overlooked, and such organisms were supposed tobe confined to a certainhorizon,
defined by a bed of what is generally known as Stinking Coal, worked princi-
pally for furnace purposes in the Chiu'net valley, and finding its representative

Ain the little coal of Wetley Moor, and the thin seam of the Roaches, careful

examination, however, of beds exposed by sinkings at Longton, led to the
discovery of fossils in the shales of a thin unworked coal called the Bay Coal,
lying nearly 4000 feet above the Stinking Coal, which corresponded in every

essential degree with the fossUs of that weU known bed in the Churnet vaUey.

It is, however, a remarkable fact that, although some of the organisms of
these widely-separated beds belong to the same type, there is a marked
difference in their mode of occurrence, and in the number and variety of both
the genera and species they represent. The Stinking-Coal MoUusca consist
of immense numbers of compressed Aviculo-pecten, Goniatites, and Posi-
donia, with Lingula and Orthoceras. In the Bay Coal shales Fosidonia
appears, so far as is known, to be absent, but Avicido-pecten is represented
by two species, accompanied by interesting examples of Goniatites, Linr/ida,
and Orthoceras. Here, however, come for the first time in this field, Spirifer,
Ctenodonta, Macrocheilus, Natieopsis, Nautilus, and Loxonema, and with
these are associated at least two species of Biscina. Again, below the Bay

Coal, in the Prior's-field ironstone, Discina is now found to be accompanied

by Linrjula, but hitherto none of the other foi-ms alluded to have been

foimd associated with them. Up to the present moment no instance has

come imder notice of the direct commingling of Anthracosia or its congeners
with either of the shells referred to. In the case of the Bay Coal, there is
immediately above, and in contact with the Lingula shales, a thin band of
ironstone, containing Anfhracomya PMIlipsii ; but the separation of the or-
ganic contents of the two beds is as complete as if hundreds of feet of strata
divided the period of deposition of the one from that of the other. Equally
marked and distinct are the Aviculo-pecten and Goniatite beds of the lowest
measures ; wherever they occur they are found in immense numbers, generally
compressed and confined to a well-marked hne of deposit, never exceeding
16 inches in thickness, and in no case becoming incorporated with the

shales immediately above or below it. This peculiarity is further illustrated
by a thin band of lean ironstone, lying about 50 feet above the Stinking
Coal in the Churnet valley, in which were discovered last year remarkably
fine examples of Avindo-pecten papyraceus. The Froghall hasmatite, in
some instances of thinning out, forms the matrix of Anthracosia acuta, but
beyond this its organic contents are remarkably scanty and obscure. Below
this bed, at the base of what, however, appears to be the shales of the first
grit, occurs another band of haematite, which, in its line of outcrop on the banks
of the river Churnet near Consall, is overlaid by a nodular bed of earthy iron-
stone, containing Goniatites and Posidonia ; and in the shales by which it is
covered, these fossils are accompanied by Aviculo-pecten and Orthoceras.
It is therefore a matter of some interest that the lowest or first fossiliferous

deposit of the true coal-measures of this field is characterized by a moUusk

regarded as of freshwater origin, which, existing dm-ing the deposition of
 the thick intervening chocolate-coloured shales, ultimately gave place to the
marine forms of the Stinking Coal shales, and with its congeners alter-
nated with Avicido-pecten, Goniatites, and Posidonia to the base of the

more productive measures of the great Pottery coal-field. Beyond this, up
to the Prior's-field ironstone, 2500 feet above it, no known break occurs in
the distribution of the inferred freshwater mollusks, but they spread outwards
--344 REPORT 18G4.

mand upwards, varying species and thickness of deposit, occasionally form-

ing compact masses several feet in depth, and affording, independent of their

geological interest, in many well-known cases a reliable key to the miner in

his critical and laborious pursuits.
   The distribution of fish-remains is as a rule more general and uniform than

that of the mollusks ; and although in the presumed marine deposits there
is a specific difference in the case of Palceoniscus, in no other genus met with
is it perceptible. In the haematite bed a fish-scale, and one only, has been
found, and this, the earliest representative of the order appears to be an ex-
ample of DipJopterus. The Stinking-Coal shales contain, intermixed with the
marine fossils enumerated, two or three species of Palceoniscus, large spines,
and a curious palate as yet undescribed ; and it is an interesting fact in con-

nexion with this bed that in no other deposit but the shales of the Bay Coal
have simdar species of Palceoniscus been met with. As far therefore as the
subject has been investigated, two instances occur throughout this enormous

deposit of coal-measures, of the introduction on a definite horizon of animal

life restricted to jjarticular limits, and holding no communion with that by
which it was preceded and followed,

    Palceoniscus is the most widely distributed fish in this field, remains of it
being found in nearly sixty different beds ; it often occurs in a beautiful
state of preservation, especially in the shales of the Deep Mine ironstone at

Longton ; and it may be here remarked as a somewhat significant circum-

stance that, in coal and ironstone shales thickly charged with shells, fish-
remains seldom occur otherwise than as detached scales and teeth ; and even
these as a rule are confined to a bed, lying in the form of a bone-bed, imme-
diately upon the coal or ironstone with which they are associated. The
ironstones of the Knowles and Cockshead coal often contain weU-preserved
fish ; and in the shales of the former, as well as in those of the Brown Mine, are
occasionally found concretionary masses of shells in the form of nodules, but
in no instance has either fish or sheU been detected within the body of coal
itself, although almost every coal-seam contains upon its upper surface a
thin coating as it were of broken and detached organisms, either fish or shell,
or both. It would therefore appear that after the submergence of the coal-

bed, and before the waters had become charged with mud or other extra-
neous matter, subsequently deposited, the fish or moUusk sinking to the

bottom was subjected to the action of currents, by which the disintegrated
parts were carried here and there, and redeposited on the surface of the future
coal-seam, or baud of ironstone.

    Succeeding Palceoniscus in j^oint of numbers and general distribution is a
fish with small cycloid scales, provisionally assigned to the genus Rhizodiis,
but to which in point of fact no satisfactory position has at present been
attributed. There are at least three speceies of it, and. Like Megalichthys, it
occurs in from forty to fifty separate deposits. Occasionally in the Brown

Mine, New and Knowles ironstones, are found portions of jaws of various

sizes, some of which belong undoubtedly to Megaliclithys, but others are as
yet undetermined. It is a circumstance of note, that of the great number of
such fragments of MegalicJithys as show scales in situ, not one has been met
with which could possibly have formed part of a fish less than 18 inches in
length, whereas in the case of the cycloidal-scaled fishes the majority of spe-
cimens range in length from 6 to 8 inches. With the other fish contained
in this field the Report will deal hereafter : as far as can at present be
ascertained, they comprise a list of nearly forty genera, represented by pro-

bably ninety species, many of which are new to science.
                ON STANDARDS OF ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE.            345

     Report of the Committee on Standards of Electrical Resistance.

--The Committee consists of Professor Williamson, Professor Wheatstono,

      Professor W. Thomson, Professor Miller, Dr. A. Matthiessen, Mr.
      rieeming Jenkin, Sir Charles Bright, Professor Maxwell, Mr. C. W.

       Siemens, Mr. Balfour Stewart, Dr. Joule, and Mr. C. F. Varley.

In the present Report it is thought unnecessary again to refer to the objects

with which the Committee was appointed, or to recapitulate the arguments

for and against the vai-ious systems of standards which have been from

time to time proposed. The Committee have seen no reason to alter the

conclusions previously adopted, and now propose briefly to state the progress

made in the practical development of those conclusions, which may be found

expressed at length in the Report for 1863.

That Report announced the adoption by the Committee of the absolute

electromagnetic system of measurement, based on the metre, gramme, and

second, with certain modifications to facilitate the practical construction or

use of the standards ; and it further stated that in 1863 the absolute resist-

ance of a certain German-silver coil had been measured with considerable

accuracy.

No standards based on the 1863 determination were officially issued, in-

asmuch as it was felt that a second determination was absolutely required

before complete dependence could be placed either on the method employed

or on the results obtained. Some coils representing 10 of the British Asso-

ciation units, i. e. 10^ absolute units according to the 1863 determination,

were made by Messrs. Elliott Brothers, and a set from 1 to 10000 was made

from the 1863 determination by Messrs. Siemens and Halske of Berlin. This

last set is intended for Col. Douglas, the Superintendent of the Government

telegraph lines in India ; and a few of Messrs. Elliotts' coils have been bought

by persons who were unwilling to wait for the final experiments by the Com-

mittee. None of these coils have been in any way certified as correct by

the Committee.

In order thoroughly to test the value of the experiments made in 1863, it

was determined that not only every measurement should be made afresh,

but that every element in the experiment should be varied. The experiment

consisted essentially in causing a coil, or rather two coils, of copper wire to

revolve or spin at a certain definite rate, and in observing the deflection of a

magnet, suspended within the coil, by the reflexion of a scale in a mirror

attached to the magnet.

The measurements required in the calculation are the following :

    In the experiments made at King's College in 1864, every part of the
apparatus, except the distance of the mean planes of the two coils from the
axis of rotation, was altered ; so that every measurement was not only made
afresh, but, where susceptible of change, was considerably different in mag-

nitude.

   Pew of the measirrements could be made by the means employed with

greater accuracy than one part in 10000, and some of them were not deter-
mined even with this degree of accuracy. No very perfect agreement be-
tween two entii'ely distinct series of experiments was therefore to be expected
but the Sub-Committee, consisting of Professor Maxwell and Mr. Jenkin,
who this year have undertaken the experiments, are fortunately able to
report a concordance between the determinations of 1863 and 1804 which is
most satisfactory.

   The difference between a standard constructed from the mean result of the
1863 experiments and a standard constructed from the mean resvdt of the
1864 experiments would be only 0*16 per cent. The probable error of the
1863 experiments is 0*24 per cent, if the mean of each day's experiments
be counted as one only; the probable error of the 1864 experiments is O'l
per cent, if the mean of each pau* of experiments with the coU revolving in
two opposite dii'ections be taken as one experiment.

   Taking into account the agreement between the means of the two years,

we may say that the determination of the Sub-Committee does not probably

differ from true absolute measurement by 0-08 per cent.
   The Committee are of opinion that, in the present state of electrical science,

the result now obtained is satisfactory, and wiU justify the immediate con-

struction of final standards of electrical resistance.

   It can hardly be doubted that, wdth the lapse of time and the inevitable
progress of knowledge, stUl better determinations will some day be made
and that even now, with still greater care and by still further multiplpng
the number of experiments, a somewhat more perfect agreement between the
standards and the theoretical absolute measurement could be ensured.

   The Committee had then to consider whether this possibly still more per-
fect agreement would be wortli the veiy great time, the labour, and the
money which would have to be bestowed xipon it. It has never been pro-

posed that the British Association standard should be considered as repre-

senting exactly an absolute measurement ; whatever may be the state of

science, any such pretension could not be well founded, for all that can be
done at any time, by the very greatest care, is to reduce the possible error to
less than a certain amount. The amount of probable error in the present de-

termination is so smaU as to be insignificant for any of the present purposes of

science, and will always remain insignificant for any practical applications.
For these applications it is chiefly important that every copy of the standard,

--whatever that may be, should be accurately made a condition which is quite

unaffected by the greater or less discrepancy between the standard and true
absolute measurement.

    The reproduction of the standard can perhaps be more easily effected, if
ever it be necessary, by a given weight of metal or alloy than by a fresh

absolute determination.

    Meanwhile practical standards of resistance are ui'gently required, and the
Committee are pressed to come to a decision. Defective systems are daily
taking fii-mer root, and the measurement of currents, quantity, capacity, and.

electromotive force caU ui'gently for the attention of youi* Committee.
    Under these circumstances they have decided to rest content with the

results of the experiments now completed, and to commence at once the

construction of standard coils.

   The details of the expeiiments on absolute resistance are given in Ap-

pendix A.

   It may be useful here to mention that the new unit wUl be roughly equal
to 0'0736 times Dr. Matthiessen's mUe of copper wire, and more exactly 1'0456

times Siemens's unit, according to standards which have kindly been sent by
Dr. Siemens to several members of the Committee and others*.

    Th questions of chief importance, after the magnitude of the standard has
been chosen and determined, concern the choice of a suitable form and mate-
rial for the actual construction of the standard, and in this choice the per-
manence of the standard is above all essential.

    Dr. Matthiessen has for two years been endeavouring, at the request of
the Committee, to discover whether the electrical resistance of various metals,
under various conditions, can be considered as constant, or can be proved to
alter. His Eeport for the present year is given in Appendix B, and will be
foimd to confirm, in a great measure, the conclusions arrived at in his Eeport
for 1863.

   No variation has been observed by him in the electrical resistance of an-

nealed wires of silver, copper, gold, platinum, nor in the hard-di'awn wires
of gold, platinum, or of the gold-silver alloy. But a change has been observed

--in the hard-drawn wires of silver and copper a change most rapid in the

first year, but very sensible in the second year ; a somewhat capricious change
has also been observed in certain annealed German-sUver wires, while others
have been proved constant. This result has been independently observed by
other members of the Committee. In the hard-di-awn wires of silver and
copper the direction of the change has been such as to bring the resistance
of hard-drawn wires more nearly to resemble that of annealed wires, dimi-
nishing the resistance ; in other words, it is such a change as would be pro-
duced by partial annealing.

   From these experiments it is clearly itndesirable that silver or copper

should be used for standards even in their annealed state ; and the change in
these metals further indicates that for standards of other metals the partially
annealed is preferable to the hard-drawn condition.

   The experiments on these points must be continued for many years before
much reliance can be placed on the results ; and meanwhile equal standards

use by the Electric and International Company. Mr. Varley has promised that for the
future exact equality shall be aimed at.

 must be constructed of various materials, aud protected in various ways, for
 reference and comparison.

    The precautions taken to prevent chemical action and mechanical injury-
 are given in Appendix B. of the Report for 1SG3. Coils of wire covered with
 silk, baked, and imbedded in solid paraffin, appear, at present, to be the
 most promising form for the unit standards. Authentic copies of the standard
 coils made of platinum-silver aUoj-, which appears likely to be permanent,

 might be issued at about £2 10s. each, and coils prepared from these by
 electrical instrument-makers could be verified at a moderate rate at Kew,
where the original standards will be deposited. No officially authentic

. coil can be issued uutil the standards themselves have been made.
    The reproduction of the standard forms the next point for consideration.

 NotwithstancUng the good results obtained by Professor Thomson's method of
making an absolute measurement, the Sub-Committee do not recommend the

adoption of this process for the reproduction of the standard, which may

 some day become necessary, owing- to the accidental destruction of, or change

in the Kew standards. Dr. Matthiessen, on the other hand, states, with con-
fidence, that a standard may be reproduced by means of metal wires of given

weight aud length, or by means of mercury, within about 0-01 per cent. ; the
report of his investigation on this subject, made conjointly with Mr. C. Hoc-

kin, is contained in Appendix C, and may be summed up as follows. He first
draws a distinction between ordinary care, great care, and absolute care. He

considers that with ordinary care the gold-silver alloy is the most suitable

material (see Eeport, 18G2) for the reproduction ; but when great care is used
lead is recommended as the most suitable material, but any reproduction bj^ one
material should be checked by others, such as mercury. With absolute care
it appears that almost any material might be used. It must be remembered

that Dr. Matthiessen considers that he himself has not taken absolute but
 only great care.

    The following Table shows the number of wires of each material tested,
their maximum discrepancy, and the probable error in a standard reproduced
by similar experiments :

Dr. Matthiessen considers 'No. 4 the tme value, while Dr. Siemens sup-

ports No. 1. The Committee do^ not desii-e to express any opinion on this

subject, but only to draw attention to the great discrepancies which follow

the apparently simple definition of the mercury unit (first proposed by Marie

Davy). Even now it cannot be said that a trustworthy standard, answering

to the definition, exists.

The Committee have little to report concerning the standard instruments

for the measurement of currents, quantity, capacity, or electromotive force.
The drawings for a standard galvanometer and electro-dynamometer have

been begun. An electro-djTiamometer, suitable for general use, has been

constructed by Professor W. Thomson, and experiments are being made Avith it.

   Professor Thomson has also had some fine apparatus made for the measure-

ment of electrostatic phenomena and their comparison with electromagnetic

measurements ; but it will be best to describe the instruments when the ex-

periments have been completed.

Dr. Joule has made some preliminary experiments with the view to rede-

termine the mechanical equivalent of the unit of heat by electrical means.

Thus, although the Committee have not accomplished all that they hoped,

they feel that such progress is being made as will justify their reappointment.

They have received assurances tliat the British Association system of units

will be readily adopted in this kingdom, in India, Australia, and Germany.

They believe that it will be accepted in Ameiica and in many other parts of

the world.

From France no response has yet been obtained.

   The Committee wish to express their sincere regret at the death of one of

their members, Dr. Esselbach. He had made valuable experiments on the

electromotive force of various chemical combinations, and had promised to

communicate them to the Committee ; but theu- record is now probably lost.

Before concluding, the Committee have to thank Mr. Charles Hockin for

the efficient assistance he has afforded, both in the determination of the

resistance unit and in Dr. Matthiessen's researches.

    * This is the mean of the values given by Kopp, Eegnault, and Balfour Stewart. The
discrepancy between the two values is far greater than could be due to any confusion as
to the reference of the specific gravity to water at 0° and at maximum density.

   Pleeming Jbnkin, with the assistance of Mr. Charles Hockin.

The method employed in these experiments has been fully described in Ap-
pendix D. to the Report of 1863. In the new experiments, the elements of
the calculation were varied as much as possible ; fresh wire was wound on
the experimental coils ; observations were made with velocities differing
widely from one another. Fresh measurements were made of all the cor-

rections required, and greater precautions were taken to avoid local disturb-

ances.

    --Appendix B. On the Electrical Permanency of Metals and Alloys.

                              By A. Matthxessen, F.ILS.

In Appendix A. of the Report of your Committee of last year, I gave the
results of some experiments made to test the electrical permanency of some

metals and alloys. On August 5 of this year I re-tested them, and give the

=results in the following Tahle, taking the conductiug-power of No. 15 100-00,

as was done in last year's Report.
--353 REPORT 1864.

    All the values have been reduced to the first observed temperature, assuming
that all pure metals vary in conducting-power alike with temperature. The

correction made was the addition or subtraction of 0'036 for each 0°-l,
which number corresjionds to the correction of conducting-power for tempe-
rature at 20°. No correction has been made in the cases of No. 15 and 16,
for it is so small that it may be neglected, being about 0-006 for each 0°4.

   As stated in last year's Report, the differences may be considered due to

temperature ; for, as there explained, a difference in the temperature of the

wire and the bath might well exist, and we find in most cases a difference

in the conducting-power corresponding to 0°'l to 0°-2.
    It is interesting to find that hard-drawn silver and copper wires become

partially annealed by age, at least the increment in the conducting-power
would indicate such to be the case. In the case of silver, a decided increment
wiU be observed.

    No. 8, copper, annealed, has altered so much, that there can be no doubt
that it was badly soldered.

   With regard to the alteration observed with the German-silver wires, it
may here again be stated that it is not to be assumed that all wires of this

alloy will alter in like manner. An example of this has lately come to my

notice. About two years ago I made a coil of the gold-silver alloy, which
was compared with one of Prof. Thomson's German-silver coils, and having

them stiU in my possession, they have now been re-compared svith the follow-

ing results:

    July 8th, 18C2. Eesistanee of Thomson's coil being 1 at 18°-4, that of
the gold-silver coil was -88445 at 18°-4.

   August 6, 1864. Eesistanee of Thomson's coil being 1 at lS°-4, that of
the gold-silver coil was -88447 at 18°-4.

   It is worthy of remark that the first comparison was made bj' Dr. C. Vogt,
the last by Mr. C. Hockin, and with entirely different apparatus, showing
that different observers with different apparatus obtain absolutely the same
results, when they take great care in making the observations.

   The above proves that the conducting power of aU specimens of German-
silver wire does not alter bj^ age. Further experiments are being made on
this subject, and in the course of a year or so we shall be able to say how
far German silver may be trusted for making resistance coils.

--Appendix C. On tJie Beproduction of Electrical Stmulards hi/ Chemical Means.

   By A. Matthiessen, F.E.S., and C. Hockin, Felloiu of St. Jolm's College,

     Cambridfje.

Having been requested by your Committee to make some experiments with
the view of discovering the best method of reproducing an unit of electrical
resistance by chemical means, we have carried out the research of which we
now propose to give the results.

   The experiments have been made with unusual care. It is important to

point out the degree of precaution that has been taken to insure trustworthy

results. The care taken in these experiments may be called great care as

opposed to ordinary care on the one hand, and thorough care on the other.

By ordinary care is meant the care usually taken in scientific research, where
no extraordinary precautions are had recourse to. The sort of accuracy
obtained when a unit is reproduced with ordinary care may be seen by

reference to former results. For instance, in the determination of the con-
ducting-power of mercury, described in ' Phil. Trans.', results were obtained
I
ON STANDARDS OF ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE.           353

differing in some cases by 1-6 per cent. The same degree of accuracy was

obtained in the determination of the mercury unit by Dr. W. Siemens, de-

scribed in ' Phil. Mag.'

   On the other hand, in the experiments to be described, and in those made

by Mr. Sabine, the results differ by only a few hundredths per cent.
    The results of the determinations of the conducting-power of the gold-

silver alloy, described in the ' Phil. Mag.' Eeb. 1861, differ from each other

by 1-5 per cent., the values now found for the same quantity differ by only
seven-hundredths per cent. No doubt if greater care had been taken and

more perfect instruments used, stiU better results would have been obtained.
   Perhaps the great difference between what is above called great care and

ordinary care lies in the time employed. The experimenter using great care
has to neglect almost all consideration of time, and repeat his experiments at
reasonable intervals, in all cases in which it is possible, that by lapse of time

such error, as at first there is no means of detecting, may increase, and so

become apparent. The meaning of absolute care is clear. AMien absolute

care is taken no precautions are omitted, the best instruments obtained, and
every care taken in the manipulation.

   The apparatus used in the following research will first be described, the
results obtained will be then given, and finally some remarks made on them.

                                   Description of Appabatus.

--Battery. The battery employed was a single Bunsen's cell. The wires

connecting it with the bridge ran parallel to each other the whole of their

length, so that no attraction was exercised on the magnet of the galvano-

--meter by the current traversing them*.
   Balance. For measuring the resistance of the wires a Whcatstone's ba-

Alance, as modified by Kirchhoff, was employed.  plan of it is given at

Plate IV. (fig. 1).

  KL and are two resistance coils acting as the arms of the balance. They
are joined by Athe wire A^, along which the eblock B connected with one end

of the galvanometer coil can be moved.

The wire A A' of the instrument was made of an alloy containing 85 per

cent, of platinum and 15 per cent, of iridium. The advantages of employing

this alloy are that it does not readily oxidize, that it does not change much

in conducting-power with an alteration of temperature, and that it does not

alloy with mercury.

   S is a standard coil immersed in an oU-bath.

     P is the wire to be measured or compared with the standard S, and is

immersed in a large trough of water.

   G is an ordinary galvanometer by which approximate results are first

observed.

   Gj is a very sensitive Thomson's reflecting galvanometer, by which the
final observations are made.

   Mj, Mj &c., wi,, »)(, &(?· are mercury cups used to connect the several parts
of the circuit by thick copper rods and bars, ])lainly shown on the drawing.
The arrangement shown was foimd convenient, as it admitted of adjustment

to various positions and dimensions of conductors to be compared. The

Aposition of B on the wire A' could be observed by a boxwood scale divided

into millimetres and a pointer on the block.

  K is a key used to complete tlie batteiy circuit, and worked by a treadle

   * Tlie batteiy circuit was generally broken, and was closed by pressing down a treadle,
placed under the table, with the foot. The terminals were of platinum.

from beloTv. An enlarged section of the block B is given in fig. 3. a, is a

wooden handle, by \rhich the rod b, Tvith the platinum point d, can be de-

pressed so as to come in contact -with the wire of the bridge. When the pres-

sui-e of the hand is removed the spring e lifts the handle and breaks the con-

tact. The galvanometer wire is screwed in between the metal plates / and g.

A pad of gutta percha between the knob h and the handle prevented any-

sensible thermal current. To the top of the block was fixed a piece of brass

Awith a slit in it to serve as a pointer.  lens also was fastened to the handle

to read fractions of a milhmetre on the scale. The body of the block was of

lead, with a slab of ebonite at the top and bottom. The block ran on a tram-

way parallel to the scale and wire of the balance.

  A section of one of the mercury cups is given at fig. 2. At the bottom of
mthe cylindrical cup I n o is placed an amalgamated copper plate, and

mercury is poui-ed into the cup ; the plate is held down by the wooden

cylinder ^5, and this is kept in its place by the pin r s. This plug fits the
cup closely, and is pierced with two or more holes for the terminals to pass

through. The cups were propped up with wedges, when placed under the

fixed terminals of the balance, that these might press fii-mly against the

metal bottoms of the cups.

  REach of the coils and L had a resistance of about 20 metres of the

wire of the instrument. Careful measures were made of the resistance of

the wire of the bridge at different points in order to find if there were any

Rvery faulty points in it ; this was done by putting the coils and L in their

places, and increasing the resistance of one of them by means of a short

piece of wii-e. The effect of this wire was to shift the zero-point. Two

coUs, differing about one-tenth per cent., were then placed in the centre of the

instrument and the reading taken ; these coils were then reversed and the

reading again taken.

   Suppose 2 I the resistance of the circuit from the point B to B' when

the short vnve is removed, z the change in the zero-point caused by the in-

sertion of the short wire above mentioned, and a: the difference of a pair of

Areadings ; resistances being expressed in millimetres of the wire A', and

lengths expressed in milhmetres of the scale. Then the resistance of a milli-

metre of the wire of the instrument about the zero-point is

                                         a+o X

- is the ratio of the two centre coils.

   The value of this expression was found for different points from one end
to the other of the wire, and did not vary more than two- or thi'ee-tenths
of a milhmetre, an error not considerable enough to aflfect the results obtained

with the instrument.

  EThe value of the coil was thus found. It was placed in the mercury

cups m'j, m\, and the cups n\, m^ were joined by a stout copper bar. Two coils,

the ratio of the resistance of which was Icnown, were placed in the two centre
cups and the reading taken.

Let - be the ratio of two centre coils, re the reading of scale, which

o

E+rwas divided from A' to A,  the resistance of the circuit from B' to the

point of wii-e opposite that end of the scale nearest to E, viz. A', I the corre-

sponding quantity for the other side of the instrument.

The measurements of lengths of wii-es tested M'ere made with a beam

compass. It was furnished with a vernier carrying a telescope. The in

strument was fixed horizontally before a window, the ends being clamped t'
shelves in the wall on either side of the window.

The telescope pointed downwards, and the wires to be measured were laic

on a board fixed below the instrument.

"With this apparatus measurements could be made with the greatest cer-

tainty to j'ijth of a miLlimetre, the telescope being sufficiently jjowerful t(

show much smaller lengths than this.

  We are indebted to Mr. B. Stewart for measuring the values of the divi-

sions of the instrument.

 --Thermometers. Two thermometers were employed. They were made bj

Messrs. Negretti and Zambra. One was divided to 4th of a degree Centi-

grade, the other to single degrees. The large thermometer was found to be

correct by the Kew standard. The zero-points of the thermometers Avere

carefuUy taken.

 --Trou'/h. The wires, the resistance of which were to be determined, were

jilaced in a glass tube immersed in a trough of water.

AThe trough was 1-5 m. long by 0-15 m. square section.      stream of water

Vflowed through it, coming in by the tube (fig. 1) and escaping by the waste-

pipe ^y. This arrangement was adopted because it was found that naphtha

or oil soon acted on the wires and altered their resistance, so that they could

not be immediately exposed to the action of a liquid. The details of the
arrangement wiU be understood by reference to fig. 4.

The wire to be tested, a b, was soldered at its ends to copper bars as a c.

On to each of these bars was slipt a piece of glass tubing, as ef. These tubes

were fastened to the copper bars by india-rubber tiibing. The wire, with

Aits connexions, was then placed in the large glass tube B. The piece of

CEDFtubing ef was then fastened to the bent tube  by india-rubber tubing.

The ends of the terminals a c were beaten out flat and amalgamated.

The bent tubes were nearly filled with morcur^', and the terminal c was con-

nected with the mercury cups m\, in'^ of the instrument by copper rods amal-

gamated at each end.

The resistances of the -wires were compared with those of coils of German

silver, well varnished, immersed in a cup of oU. The temperature of the oil

nexions made. The water was then turned on and alloAved to flow for about

fifteen minutes. The large thermometer was placed in the trough, and the

temperature Avas read off by means of a lens placed so as to avoid all error

of parallax. The small galvanometer was then connected with the electric

balance, and the approximate reading foxmd.

The large galvanometer Avas next connected, and the block handle pressed

down until any thermal current that existed had ceased to cause the needle

of the galvanometer to osciUate. The battery contact was then made for an

instant with the foot. The slight kick given by the spot of light at once

sliowed which Avay the block had to be moved, without its being necessary

to keep the battery on long enough to heat the conductors sensibly.

The obsen'ing-room was kept at a very equable temperature by a screen

before the AvindoAV, also the wire of the balance was protected by a piece of

boarding from the heat radiating from the observer's body.

After every observation the temperature of the coil and the water in the

trough was read off, and if any difference was observed between these read-

ings and those first taken, the observation was rejected and another one

taken.

   Four observations were made on each wire at intervals of from twenty to

forty minutes.

   Before noting dovm the scale-reading all the connectors were moved, and
if no change in resistance was observed the connexions were presumed to be

good.

    All results are given in terms of weight and length, as it is impossible to
measure the diameter of a small wire with the accuracy with which the
weight can be found ; moreover, the cross section of a wire is not generally a

circle, and the mean diameter varies shghtly from point to jjoint however
carefully it may be drawn.

  A great oversight was made in not observing the specific gravity of each

wire, so that the results of the experiments now made could be compared
with former ones. This omission was first made because it was thought

that the results of former experiments could be xised; but after several

measurements had been made it was found that the values of the specific
gravity of wires of the same metal, given by dificrent observers, varied so
much that it was impossible to find the resistance of a wire of a metal of
which the length and sectional area are kno-v\'n, from the resistance of a wire
of which the length and weight are known without taking the specific gravity

of the wire actually experimented on.

Three silver wires were compared.

                       T. From commercially pure nitrate of silver.
                      II. From French coin.
                    III. From English coin.

   The silver was first dissolved in nitric acid and thed diluted with water and

precipitated by hydrochloric acid. The chloride was then weU washed, and

afterwards fused with pure carbonate of sodium. The resulting button of

silver was fused a second time with borax and a little nitrate of potas-

sium ; lastly, before casting, it was fused with a piece of charcoal floating on
the top. The mould was about 35 miUimetrcs long by 4| millimetres dia-

meter. The drawing of the wire was conducted with the utmost care. The

wire was annealed only twice during the process.

In di'awing aU wires the end first entering the hole was reversed at each

successive drawing, after it had been drawn down to about one-half its re-

quired diameter. The wires were twice drawn through each of the smallest

holes, the ends being reversed as before.

To measure the harder wires they were straightened by rolling them

between two smooth boards, and then passed through a thermometer tube of

such a length that the ends just projected fi-om the tube, the long ones being-

cut into two or three lengths for the purpo^se. It was found that the wire

could be pulled out of the tube and reinserted many times without altering

the length by half one-tenth of a millimetre. Some care was necessary in

Asoldering the wires to their connexions.  small lump of hot solder Avas

placed in the terminal, and the end of the wire steadily and slowly pushed

into it until it set. Thus the boimdary between the wire and solder was weU

defined, and the wire could be cut off at exactly the required point. The

wires were weighed and measured after the resistance had been taken.

The care taken in di-awing the silver wires accounts for the close agree-

ment of the resiilts. Another ^\'ire was drawn as rapidly as possible through
the latter holes to harden it, and a difference of 3| per cent, was found in

its conducting power.

   The results are given in the following Table :

   The metal was first dissolved in nitro-hydrochloric acid, the excess of
acid was then evaporated off, and the salt largely diluted with water to
precipitate the chloride of sUver. After filtering the gold was precipitated
by sulphiu-ous acid, the precipitate collected in a small beaker, and washed
four times with hydrochloric and nitric acid alternately. After drying it
was fused with borax and nitrate of potassium and cast. It was again fused,
and finally cast in the mould.

The wires were pressed at a gentle heat, the press being carefully bored and
cleaned beforehand. As the wire came from the press it was received on a
smooth board. It was then at once soldered on to the connexions and placed

m the trough. The solder employed was AVood's cadmium alloy. After

being cut from the connectors the wii"e was straiglitened by rolling between
two boards with great care ; it was then placed on the board beneath the
beam-compass, adjusted to the groove below the line of motion of the cross
wires of the telescope, and carefully measured and then weighed.

   Three tubes were filled with mercury and their resistance taken.
   Tubes Nos. I. and II. with distilled mercury treated with nitric and sul-
phuric acid.
   Tube No. III. with mercury distilled from a specimen which contained a

small quantity of gold.

   The lengths of the column are given below in their order.

        Tube I.
       ON STANDARDS OF ELKCTKICAL RESISTANCE.                        363

To calibrate a tube it was taken and carefully cleaned with pure nitric acid,

and then with a solution of caustic potash. It was then weU rinsed with

distilled water, and dried by passing a current of hot air through a chloride-

Aof-calcium bulb, and then through the tube.         small column of mercury

was put in the tube, and the length of column measui-ed by the beam-com-

pass. Tho column was shifted along the tube by sucking up or blowing-

through an india-rubber tube with a chloride-of-calcium tube inserted be-

tween it and the tube to be calibrated. By this arrangement the column

could be adjiisted with the greatest nicety to the place in the tube required.

The lengths of the column were taken at equal intervals from one end of tube

to the other. The formula for correction used is given below.

Let C be conducting-power of a tube of uniform bore and of length, ca-

Cpacity equal to that of tube considered ;      observed conducting-power.

The ends of the tubes were ground by putting some emery powder and

naphtha on a slate table, holding the tube vertically iipright with the left hand

and with the right hand rubbing the end of the tube in contact with the

table round the circumference of a small circle. Thus the end of the tube

was made slightly convex, the opening being at the apex of the convexity.

To measure the tubes they were placed under the beam-compass, and a stout

pin inserted partially into each end.

Fi'om the shape of the ends of the tube, the point where the pin emerged

from the tube coidd be exactly seen and the measurement made with cer-
tainty. Many measurements were made turning the tube round its axis through

a small angle before each measurement, and the mean of the lengths found

taken for the true length. To find the weight of the tube full of mercury it

was carefully cleaned, filled with mercury, and placed in a long narrow

trough fuU of pure mercury. The tube was held down by iron weights, a

thermometer inserted in the trough, and the apparatus allowed to stand until

the temperature was constant. After the true temperature had been obtained

the tube was taken out of the trough and the contents weighed.

This was managed in the following manner. One operator took hold of

the tube by pressing a finger against each end and lifting from the ti'ough

the httle globules adhering to the outside of the tube were then rapidly re-

moved by two assistants with brushes.

The mercury was then allowed to flow slowly out into a small porcelain

crucible and weighed. In this way pretty consistent results were obtaiued

if the tubes were cleaned before each filliag.

To determine the resistances of the tubes they were placed in the water

trough, with bent pieces of tubing fastened on to the ends with india-rubber

tubing and reaching above the surface of the water.

The terminals were of copper, well amalgamated. They dipped into the

bent tubes and came flat against the ends of the tubes, the resistance of which

was to be determined. In the calculation of the weight of mercury at 0° in

the tube from the observed weight, Regnault's value for the expansion was

used.

                                                                2b2

    Connexions of amalgamated platinum were first used, but did not give
good results. It was found that the amalgamation was imperfect. The mer-
cury adhering to the platinum was rubbed off against the ends of the tube,
and the resistance varied with the height of the mercury in the bent tubes.
The platinum was amalgamated by dipping it into a mixture of mercury and
sodium amalgam. The sodium was then oxidized and chssolved off by dip-
ping the platinum in a little dish of water and hydi'ochloric acid. The ter-
minal was then drawn through a dish of clean mercury, so that the water
floated off. The platinum was then for the time beautifully amalgamated

but the mercury soon drained off when the plate was exposed to the air, and
could be easily rubbed off even when the platinum was immei'scd in mercmy.

   From the foregoing results we may draw these conclusions.
   That with great care an unit may be reproduced with great accuracy by

anj' of the metals or alloys above mentioned.

   Of those tested it appears that lead is the most preferable on account of
its easy purification, and because the presence of impurities, amounting to
several per cent., produce no very disproportionate effect on its conducting-
power. For instance

Conducting-power of lead is                                 7-77

   "With the other metals and alloys tested a much greater difference is found
in the conducting-power when such impurity exists.

  A few examples wiU show this.

The conducting-power of pure copper is                            100
                                                                  65

   The manipulation with lead is rendered easier by its high resistance.
   Mercury is easily purified, and good results are always obtained with

it. It would, however, in reproducing an unit, be necessary to distill the

mercuiy, because traces of such impurities as silver and gold, which may
easily get into it when in use in a laboratory, cannot be removed by treat-

ment wifh nitric acid. The chief labour is in selecting and calibrating the
tubes, and this is vei-y great.

   The results obtained with the gold-silver aUoy, even when prepared by

different persons, supposing great care used, give very accordant results,

and for the easiness with which it can be made may be recommended for re-

producing an unit.
   Electrotype copper would appear a good siibstance. The agreement of

results obtained with commercial electrotype copper with those obtained
with copper prepared from pure salts shows this.

   The maximum difference of the conducting-powers of electrotype copper,

as observed with ordinary care, is 1-6 per cent. Copper is not, however, to
be preferred, as great care and some practice is necessary to draw a good

wire.

    The pirrification and drawing of pure gold and silver would, in the hands
of anyone but a chemist, lead to no good results, iu aU probability. These
facts being considered, we should prefer lead for the reproduction of an unit.
No doubt it would be well to use two or three substances to check the results.
For these auxiliary substances mercury and the gold-silver alloy may be re-
commended. The choice between these two will depend on the appliances of

the indi\ddual observer. When thorough care is taken aU the above means

are equally good.

   On forming an opinion on the difficulty of reproducing an unit by chemical

means it must be remembered that if anything like .accuracy is wished for,
not only expensive and delicate apparatus is required, but also very much time
must be spent, and a great deal of experience in the manipulation is required.

The experiments here described extended over about six months. Any

person wishing to reproduce an unit should bear these considerations in mind,
especially as it is the intention of your Committee to cause coils to be issued

representing a known resistance. That copies of a given resistance can be
made to a much greater acciu'aey than that to be obtained by chemical or
other known means of reproduction, and that coils can be compared by dif-

ferent observers witli different apparatus to almost any degree of accuracy,
although this fact has been brought into question by a former experimenter,
is proved by the following facts.

    The two units whic'h have come into our hands, made by Messrs. Siemens
and Halske from copies of the coil used last year by your Committee for the
determination of the absolute unit, were compared against the standard coU
and found to agree with it within two-hundredths per cent. Again, copies of
Weber's unit, one made of the gold-silver alloy, the other of German silver,
were compared at the interval of two years by different observers with dif-
ferent apparatus, and the results found to agree to one -half a hundi-eth per

 cent.

     It is from the fact that copies can be produced with almost absolute

 accuracy, with a minimum of cost and labour as compared with chemical or
mechanical means of reproduction, that we seem quite justified in recom-
 mending all who wish to obtain a standard to procure a copy of the British
 Association unit, or any other in general use. As copies of the British Asso-
 ciation unit are being sold at a reasonable price by several of the leading in-
 strument-makers, which we are given to understand wiU agree together very
 closely, we confidently recommend the adoption of this unit.

    And in conclusion, we still adhere to the opinion, given in Appendix C of

 the Report of 1862, that the best means of reproducing an unit, for those

 who have not the opportunity of procuring a copy, and who cannot afford the

timfe and expense necessary to reproduce the unit with great care, is to pro-
euro a given length and weight of the gold-silver alloy, such as shall havo
been found equal to the unit adopted. The quantity required being very
nearly 0-5995 of a metre of a wire, one metre in length of which would weigh

a gramme for the British Association imit.

     On the Fall of Rain in the British Isles during the Years 1862
                  nnd 1863. By G. J. Symons, M.B.M.S.

The resolution of the General Committee of this Association having involved

two branches of progress in the collection of rainfall statistics, it appears best
to notice separately what has been done in each.

    To take iirst the grant for additional rain-gauges and its appropriation.
The whole of the existing stations contributing to the tables of rainfall pub-
lished in the British Association Eeport for 1862, together with aU additional
stations subsequently obtained, were laid down on blank maps, a list was
then made of the localities where new stations were most urgently required,
and this list was forwarded (with the following letter) to " The Times."

To the Editor of Tlie Times.

 --SiE, I have on several occasions been indebted to your courtesy for the

rapid circulation of particulars of rainfall ; may I anticipate your assistance

in obtaining a few recniits in rather out-of-the-way districts, some of which
can hardly be reached save by " The Times ?"

   Those of your readers who take an interest in the subject are mostly aware
that the collection of statistics of rainfall which I commenced a few years since,
has extended so much, that there are now nearly 700 stations contributing
theii' observations to a common centre, and receiving in return copies of those
made at aU the others. They will, therefore, probably be at first surprised

to find that the object of this letter is to obtain more stations, and will re-
quire some information before they see the necessity that exists for their

establishment. The fact is, that although there are now probably as many
stations at work as are necessary for most piu-poses, they are not uniformly
distributed throughout the United Kingdom ; and as it is impossible to expect

a gentleman to change his residence because his observations would be more

valuable elsewhere, it is obvious that the only plan is to start fresh gauges
in the districts where observations are required.

   This proposal has been endorsed by the British Association, and funds have

been placed at my disposal " for the purpose of constructing and transmitting

rain-gauges to districts where observations are not at present made."

  My first request is, that any persons who regularly observe the faU of rain,

and have not yet communicated with me, will do so at once, as otherwise I

Mymight be starting gauges unnecessarily close to them.  second request is

that persons residing in or near any of the imdermentioned towns or districts,

having an available open space, and mUiug to take charge of a very simple

gauge, will notify their consent to me. It will save much correspondence if
--368 REPORT 1864.

they also state whether they will purchase a gauge (both Negretti and Zambra,

and Casella now make them accurately, as low as 10s. Gd. each), or prefer

my sending one of the British Association gauges.

The list looks rather extensive, and is so, but the blank places exist, and it

is surely better to acknowledge than to ignore them. It is a good time for

commencing, as a little practice may now be had before the new year begins.

There is no subscription, nor anything of the kind ; for the observers either

receive the publications gratis, or at the cost of printing, paper, and postage
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

    About three hundred replies were received to this letter, and the task of
selecting the most eligible localities and persons was very onerous, not to

mention the correspondence necessarily involved. Eventually, however, Mr

SjTUons was enabled to send the following letter to " The Times," as some
acknowledgment of the service rendered by the insertion of the previous

letter.

           To the Editor of The Times.

--Sir, Many of your readers may feel interested in the result of your in-

myserting  plea for additional obsei-vers of the fall of rain in districts whence

previously returns had not been received.

As letters are still pouring in daily, and the arrangements far from com-

plete, the following list comprises but a portion of the service rendered. I

thought I knew pretty well what assistance I should receive, but am happy

to say that both in quality and quantity my estimate has been siu-passed.

The applications for " Association" gauges from districts to which I should

like to have sent them, have been so much more numerous than was ex-

pected, that a most reluctant refusal has been frequently necessitated, and

individual replies to aU the offers of assistance rendered all but impossible.

The former (financial) difficulty has been much lessened, by the large pro-

portion of my correspondents, who, on learning how matters stood, have

defrayed the cost of their own instrument, as well as undertaken the neces-

sary duties.

   The extent to which this extra kindness has prevailed, will not he the least

pleasant feature in the account of my stewardship, which I shall have to

render at the Bath Meeting of the British Association.

It may be well to correct an erroneous impression which seems rather pre-

valent, viz., that I do not care for observations save from the districts I

named ; that is not the case. I do not for a moment undertake to use any-

--body's observations good, bad, or indifferent ; but in an amateur system, re-

moval and death are constantly thinning the ranks, and hence it becomes

necessary to have a reserve corps ready to fill the vacancies ; besides which,

they act as checks on one another.

   I cannot conclude -w-ithout a special word of thanks for the sister isle,

--whence a most imexpectedly warm rcsjjonse has been received unexpected,

because Ireland had been far behind both England and Scotland, having in

1862 only 24 contributors, against 404 and 160 respectively. Now however,

though stni least in number, they are so well distributed over the countiy, as

to afford safe data for the discussion of its rainfall, save that Killarncy has

not yet sent in a representative.

With many thanks for your assistance, to which science owes so much,

   It may be added that the above list of new stations must be looked upon

simply as the record of stations at work prior to January 1st, 1864, since

which time there has been a steady increase in the numbers.

One most important step has been taken during the present year, namely,

the organization of a series of stations in the north of Wales, especial atten-

tion being paid to the district immediately around Snowdon, the principal

object being to compare the fall in that part of the country with that in the

Lake District of Cumberland and Westmoreland. Owing to tlie previous ex-

penditure of the whole of last year's small grant, the cost of this scries of

stations has fallen on Captain Mathew, of Wern, Carnarvon ; while, owing to
Mr. Symons's illness, the trouble of organizing them and superintending the

erection of the gauges has also fallen on Captain Mathew ; it is, however,

doubtful if it could have been in better hands. The gauges were specially

constructed with regard to their adaptability for the measurement of snow as
well as rain ; how far they will answer remains to be proved ; they were
made by Casella, and tested by Mr. Symons before being despatched to

Captain Mathew. It is proposed that there shall be not less than twenty-

two stations, so as to render the series as complete as possible.

   The following Table gives their heights above Mean Sea-Level, and other

   It cannot bnt be very gratifying to all those who are interested in the im-

portant practical question of the fall of rain in this country to find Captain

Mathew ready to take, single-handed, both the trouble and expense of

organizing this extensive cordon of stations, almost, if not quite as extensive
as those supported for some years in the Lake District by the Eoyal Society

but he, like Colonel Ward and the Rev. J. Chadwick Bates, spare neither

trovible nor expense in working out their several branches of rainfall investi-

gations, so that there is good ground to expect that many questions hitherto

unsolved -vntLI be completely settled in the coiirse of a very few more years.
   Further examination has been made of the gauges actually at work, up-

wards of 100 having been visited and tested in situ, a most important matter
far more so than the examination of gauges before they are sent off into the
country, inasmuch as the former eusui'es the knowledge of the accuracy or
otherwise of the instrument, and also the suitability of its position, while the
latter object is of course only to be attained by actually visiting each station.
Although this requires both laboiu', time, and expense, its paramount impor-
tance demands its speedy accomplishment. In the interim every endeavour
is made to check the erection of any but accurate instruments, upwards of
150 having been tested last year previous to their despatch to various parts
of the United Kingdom, as well as some for foreign countries.

   Details respecttug the fall of rain in 1862-63 can only be given advanta-
geously in tables, whereof are appended to this Report such as will render
evident the variations and particulars most worthy of interest ; but the broad

outlines characterizing the distribution of rain during 1862 and 1863 may be

thus briefly sketched. Taking, first, the whole of the stations in England,

Scotland, and Ireland, we find the average fall in each of the years 1860,

1861, and 1862 about 10 per cent, above the average of the last half-
century*; but on closely examining Table I., it will be found that the ex-

--cess thus shown is apparent rather than real, being due maiuly to the enor-

mous excesses in the Lake District averaging about 30 inches per year.

We find moreover that the fall in the three years 1860, 1861, and 1862 was

nearly equal, the difference in fact being less than half an inch, while 1863,
which was rather drier than the others, differed only by 5 per cent. These
uniform results are very surprising, considering that in some districts the
fluctuation has been nearly 100 per cent. ; for instance, Holkham, 1860, was
35 inches, 1863, was only 18 inches. Torosay Castle, 1860, was 70 inches,

   * See Brit. Assoc. Report, 1862, p. 296, Table II., whence it appears that the rainfall
during the ten years 1850-59 was 5 per cent, below the mean of the .50 years ending 1861.
Therefore the mean value Sl'OS has been i-aised to 36'73 before making these deductions.
--372 REPORT 1864,

--and 1863 was 111 inches a difference in the one case the reverse of the

other; in the one case of 17 inches excess in 1860, the other 41 inches

excess  in  1863                    yet  the  general  average  throughout the country remains
                                 ;

nearly constant ; it is in fact a similar compensation in yearty totals to that

which has prevailed during the drought now so much felt in the south of

England at the very time that the north-west of Scotland has been suffering

from want of dry weather.

It is further evident, from even a cursory examination of the Table of

average fall, that there has been a series of three dry years in the Midland

Counties of England, just as there has been a series of three wet ones in

Ireland and along the west coast of Scotland.

The drought at stations in the North Midland Counties has been even more

felt than is warranted by the small fall in 1863, because the ground lias

had no chance of resuming its normal condition since the partial drought in

1861. The minimum recorded fall is 14-46 in 1863 at SouthAvell, Nottingham-

shire, in which district seven stations return less than 17 inches; on the

other hand the maximum of 1863, 173-84 at Seathwaite, is supported by

173 inches at Drishaig, by Dalmally, and by six other stations with an

annual fall between 100 and 150 inches.

The fall in different districts, and the difference between the fall in the

years 1862 and 1863, are shown by the accompanying map, similar in scale

and design to the one published with the last lieport, and in many respects

evidencing the same equipoise, if it may so be termed, as in the years 1860

and 1861. In this map, as in the previous one, we find the lighter disks

larger than the dark in the greater part of England, Eastern Scotland, and

most parts of Ireland ; that is to say, the earlier year wetter than the later,

1862 wetter than 1863, just as 1860 was wetter than 1861 ; the differences

between the two years (shown by the breadth of the annulus) was less than

in the previous case, and in one instance (Alderbury), vanished entirely.

The English Lakes, North Wales, and "West Scotland had their heaviest fall

in the other year, 1863, just as they had previously in 1861 ; thus, as before

stated, seeming to suggest a species of compensation.

In these Tables the arrangement is primarily into counties, the stations in

each county being in the order of latitude from S. to N. The counties are

grouped similarly with the classification of the Registrars-General of England

and Scotland, as explained on p. 294 of the previous Report. It should be

mentioned that the following Tables do not contain all the observations re-

ceived by Mr. Symons persons requiring]further information should apply to

408 REPORT 1864.

 Preliminary Investigation of the Mechanical Properties of the pro-

  posed Atlantic Cable. By William Fairbairn, LL.D., ^c, F.R.S.

 It appeared essential to the public interest that the second attempt to sub-
 merge a telegraphic cable across the Atlantic should not be left to chance,
 that a close and searching investigation should be entered upon, and that
 nothing should be left undone that could be accomplished to ensure success.
For the satisfactory attainment of this object, it was considered necessary

    Ist. To determine by direct experiment the mechanical properties of every
            cable submitted for submergence in deep water;

    2nd. To ascertain the chemical properties of the insulator, and the best
            means to be adopted for the preservation and duration of the cable ;

              and,

    3rd. To determine the electrical properties and conditions of the cable
          when immersed under pressure at great depths.

   These varied conditions were left to a committee, on whom devolved

the consideration of every qxiestion relating to
the efficiency and ultimate security of the cable.

That of its mechanical properties was left in

my hands ; and I was requested to undertake

the first division of the inquiry, and to deter-
mine, by actual experiment, the strengths, com-
binations, forms, and conditions of every cable
considered of suitable strength and proportion
to cross the Atlantic. To fulfil these condi-
tions and ensure correct results, a laborious series
of experiments were instituted ; and in order to
attain accuracy as regards the resisting powers
of each cable to a tensile strain, they were bi'okcn
by dead weights suspended from a crab or crane a,
by which they could be raised or lowered at
pleasure. The weights were laid on one hundred-
weight at a time, and the elongations were care-
fully taken and recorded in the table as each
alternate fourth hundredweight was placed on the

scale until the cable was broken. By this process
we were enabled to ascertain with great exactitude

--the amount of elongation in 7 ft. 6 in. the length

between the two iron clips screwed round the
cable, near the ends of the loops by which they
were suspended, as shown in the annexed figure
at a, b. The hook and blocks to which the cables
were attached belonged to a travelling crane
that elevated or lowered the platform b, contain-
ing the weights, to heights corresponding with the
stretch as the weights were laid on. Having ad-
justed the apparatus, the experiments proceeded
in the. order shown in the following Tables,

    In this investigation it will not be necessary
to give the experiments in detail, and for the
present a summary of results will suffice.

    In the following table will be found the ultimate strength of nearly all
the differently manufactured cables of Great Britain, and it will be seen that

they vary considerably as regards strength, ductility, &c. Several of these

--cables are of a high order of merit, and well entitled to special notice as they

reached the required point of strength a quality of great importance in cables
for submergence in deep water.

From these considerations it was deemed advi.sable to select a description

of cable containing this clement, and all the requirements to meet the con-

tingent forces to which it might be subjected. With these impressions on

the minds of the Committee, it was found desirable to select that of Messrs.

Glass, Elliott & Co., which stands highest in the order of strength in the

foregoing Table, and from the re.sults in p. 410, deduced from subsequent

experiments on upwards of forty specimens manufactured by the same firm.

In this inquiry it will be observed that upwards of forty specimens of

cables have been tested in their finished state, and this might have been

sufficient for the Committee to determine the best description of cable ; but it
was deemed ad%-isable to investigate still further, not only the cable a.s a

cable, but to test experimentally each separate part, in order that every

security should be afforded as to the strength and quality of the material to

be employed in the construction. The whole of the specimens submitted by

Messrs. Glass, Elliott & Co., were composed of the same sizes of conducting

wire insulated within alternate layers of gutta-percha and Chatterton's com-

pound, which formed the core of each. Surrounding this core, were lapped,

in a spiral direction, nine and in some cases ten wires, of -089 to -098 inch

diameter                                        and each wire was covered      with   Manilla-yarn, or St.         Petersburg
                                             ;

hemp, saturated with tar and other materials. Now, as these covering wires

constituted the principal strength of the cable, it was found desirable to test

them separately, for the purpose of ascertaining their tenacity, ductility,

   From the above, it will be seen that, out of 21 specimens experimented
upon, the maximum of strength rests with Johnson, and the minimum
with Jenkins, HOI & Co., the ratios being as 1950 : 450, or as 4-33 : 1. The
maximum of elongation to that of the minimum varies with a load of 550

lbs. as the numbers -320 for Eyland's and about -014 for Johnson's steel wu-e

in experiment 2, being in the ratio of -320 : -014, or as 22-8 : 1, nearly.

Softness and ductility have always been considered an important element in

the construction ; but this measure of ductility is probably overrated, as the
Ryland wire, with the last weight laid on (50 lbs.), was sufficient to extend

or stretch considerably before it broke. Viewing the subject in this light,

it is obvious that a very high ductility with a low standard of strength is

not what is wanted, but a combination of strength and ductility that will

jjrevent snapping from brittleness, on the one hand, and give the reqtiisite

powers of elongation without material injury to the strength, on the other.

What is therefore wanted in these wires is tenacity united to ductility in

resistance to a tensile strain, without incurring fracture, up to at least seven-

eighths of its ultimate strength.

--412 REPORT 1864.

    From a long series of well-conducted experiments, it has been found that
a good quality of ductile iron improves in strength by elongation, that is, the

whole of its fibres are brought into action by the elongation of those first
subjected to strain, or, in other words, they yield up only part of their strength
until the force reaches the other parts, so as to produce uniformity of action
throughout the whole section of the wire. This is a property of good iron
which requires to be extended to the manufacture of both steel and homo-
geneous wire ; and taking the experiments as they exist in the foregoing series
of results, I find that with proper care in the selection of the material in the
first instance, a judicious system of manipulation in the second, and a rigid
system of inspection and check upon the quidity as delivered, from time to
time, during the manufacture, that wii'c of homogeneous iron, -095 inch
diameter, can be made of strength sufficient to sustain from 900 to 1000

--lbs. with an elongation of -0068 or --i^ per unit of length. This description

of iron appears to be the most suitable for the Atlantic cable, as it combines

strength with ductility, and may be produced at a comparatively moderate

cost. Great care is, however, required to maintain, during the whole process
of manufacture, the full standard adopted at starting, both as regards the
strength and ductility of the wire.

    It was, also, found desii-able to test the separate strands of each cable, as

well as the wires themselves. For this purpose a number of strands similar
to those employed in the manufacture of the diflerent cables were procured,
and the tensile breaking-strain and elongations carefully observed and re-
corded. In order to ascertain whether the length of the lay of the hemp and

Manilla round the strand was of that spiral which produced a maximum

strength, the yarn separated from the strand was also tested, and, compai-ing
the sum of the breaking-strains of the wire and yarn separately with the
whole in combination, this object was approximately gained. The summary of
results of these experiments will be seen in the two following Tables :

fore, that gutta percha is the mo.st desirable material that can be employed

as an insulator, it then resolves itself into the question, What additional cover-
ing, and what additional strength, is necessary to enable the engineer to pay

out of a ship a length of 1600 miles into deep water so as to deposit it with-
out strain at the bottom of the ocean ? This is one of the questions the
Committee was called upon to solve, and for this very important object the
following experiments were instituted :--

wires elongate by tension, and that to a degree highly injurious to the gutta
percha insulator, which contracts the already stretched wires, producing a ten-
dency to force themselves in loops through the covering in which they are
incased. To prevent those injurious effects it is necessary to protect the core
by an outside covering of strong material, to relieve it from severe tension, and
also to protect the gutta percha from injury.

    Regarding this as a circumstance of great importance beai'ing directly
upon the ultimate strength of the cable, the Committee arrived at the con-
clusion that the cable No. 4G, composed of homogeneous wire, calculated to
bear not less than from 850 to 1000 lbs. per wire, with a stretch of f^^ths of
an inch in 50 inches, was the most suitable for the Atlantic Gable.

    Impressed with these views the Committee therefore recommended this
cable, the particulars of which will be seen in the following specification :

                     Sjjecification of No. 46 Cable.

   The conductor consists of a copper strand of seven wires (six laid round
one), each wire gauging '048 (or No. 18 of the Birmingham wire-gauge), the
entire strand gauging -144 inch (or No. 10 Birmingham gauge) and weigh-
ing 300 lbs. per nautical mile, embedded for solidity in the composition known
as " Chatterton's Compound."

   The insulator consists of gutta percha, four layers of which are laid on
alternately with four thin layers of Chatterton's compound, making a dia-
meter of the core of -404 inch and a circumference of l-y92 inch. The

--weight of the entire insulator is 400 lbs. per nautical mile.
    The External Protection. This is in two parts. First the core is sur-
rounded with a padding of soft jute yarn, saturated with a preservative mix-
ture. Next to this padding is the protective covering, which consists of ten
sohd wires of the gauge -095 inch, drawn from homogeneous iron, each wire
surrounded separately with live strands of Manilla yarn saturated with a
preservative compound, the whole of the ten strands thus formed of the hemp
and iron being laid spirally round the padded core.

   The weight of this cable in air is 34 cwt. per nautical mile ; the weight
in water is 14 cwt. per nautical mile. The breaking-strain is 7 tons 15 cwt.,

or equal to 11 times its weight per nautical mile in water, that is to say, if

suspended perpendicularly, it woidd bear its own weight in 11 miles' depth of
water. The deepest water to be encountered between Ireland and Newfound-
land is about 2400 fathoms ; and one mile being equal to 1014 fathoms, there-

fore 1014x11=  ^,^,  =4-64,  the  cable  having  thus  a     strenogth  equal  to
               2400
                                                                            1

4-64 times of its own vertical weight in the deepest water.

   In this report we have not entered upon the process of immersion, either
in tanks or the sea ; we have confined our attention exclusively to the cable

and the quality of the materials of which it should be composed, and the

questions of coiling, shipping, submersion, &c., we have left for future

inquiry.

        On a Formula of M. Chasles relating to the Contact of Conies.

                            By Professor Caxlet, F.B.S.

The author gave an account of the recent investigations of M. Chasles in relation

to the theory of conies, viz., M. Chasles has found that the properties of a system

of conies, containing one arbitrary parameter, depend upon two c[uantiti_es called

by him the characteristics of the system ; these are, /x, the number of conies of the

system which pass through a given point, and, v, the nimiber of conies of the

system  which  touch  a  given  liue ;  or,  say, /j. is  the parametric  order, v the para~
                                                                                                       ^

metric class, of the system. And he exhibited a transformation obtained by him

of a formula of M. Chasles for the number of conies which touch five given

curves, viz., if (M, m) (N, n) (P, p) (Q, q) (E, r) be the orders and classes of the

five given curves respectively, then the number of curves is

               = (1, 2, 4, 4, 2, 1) (M, m) (N, n) (P, p) (Q, q) (R, r),

where the notation stands for 1. ]MNPQR+22mNPQIl+42»wPQR+&c. The

transformed formula in question was commimicated by the author to M. Chasles,
and had appeared in the ' Comptes Rendus j' but it is, in fact, included in a very
beautiful and general theorem given in the same Number by M. Chasles himself.

                On the Prohlem of the In~and-drcumscribed Triangle.

                             By Professor Catlet, F.B.S.

  The general problem of the in-and-circumscribed triangle may be thus stated,

viz., to find a triangle the angles whereof severally lie in, and the sides severally

touch, a given curve or cm-ves ; and we may, in the first instance, inquire as to
the number of such triangles. The first and easiest case is when the curves are

all distinct ; here, if the angles lie in curves of the orders m, n, p, respectively,
and the sides touch curves of the classes Q, R, S, respectively, then the number

of tiiangles is = 2wwpQRS. The number may be obtained for some other cases

but the author has not yet considered the final and most diflicult case, viz. that in
which the angles severally lie in, and the sides severally touch, one and the same

given curve.

        On Stigmatics. By Alexander J. Ellis, F.R.S.

In ordinary analytical geometry, a point M, moving along the axis OM, is con-

j ugated by means of certain equations, with one or more points P, P' . . . so situated

that RIP, MP' ... are all parallel to a given line. In stifimatics the point M, called

the index, maybe situated a7iy2che7-e upon a plane, and the points P, P' . . , called the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               .

stigmata, may be so situated that the angles OMP, OMP' . . . are any whatever con-

sistent with certain conditions. The position and length of MP, MP' . . . , with re-

spect to those of OM, are determined by a certain law for each particular case.

                                                                is a stif/matic patJi. The aggi-egate

of all possible groups of conjugated points forms a stifpnatic. Stigmatics are the

general geometrical representatives of algebraical equations, and comprehend as

particular cases all possible and imaginary results of ordinary algebraical geometry.

H K AIf and be fixed stigmata, having the indices and B, and the triangles

Eof similar figures and of rays (real or imaginary) in involution. If and F be

PMFfixed points, and the triangles EMP,           be similar and similarly situated, then
M Pis the index, and the stigma, of a stigmatic circle, the theory of which com-

prehends that of radical axes, and geometrical involution and homogi'aphy of points

on a plane. The mode of calculating the relations of stigmatics is by means of

clinants. The clinant ah is the operation of timiing the axis of reference, 01, through

the angle (01, AB), and altering its length in the ratio of the length of 01 to that

of AB, so that ABi=rt6 . 01. The clinant --^is the operation of turning the sti-aight

CDline  through the angle (CD, AB), and altering its length in the ratio of that

of CD to that of AB, so that --- . CD=AB. These clinants completely obey the

laws of ordinaiy algebra. The clinant equations to the stigmatic straight line and

-- --.=circle, as just defined, are, therefore, v-- y/-, =; respectively, whence all their

Yproperties may be deduced. If 01, OX,            be radii of a unit circle, then, in ordinary
MPanalytical geometry, if OM,
                                   be th6 abscissa and ordinate of any point, P, re-

On tlie Geometrical Transformation of Plane Curves. B>j Professor Crejioxa,
                 of Bologna. Communimted by T. A. Hirst, F.E.S.

   In a note on the geometrical transformation of plane curves, published in the
' Giomale di Matematiche,' vol. i. p. ?>Qo, several remarkable properties possessed by
a certain system of curves of the rt-th order, situated in the same plane, were con-
sidered. The important one which forms the subject of this note has been more
recently detected, and has reference to the Jacobian of such a system, that is to
say, to the locus of a point whose polar lines, relative to all curve.s of the system,
are concurrent.

   The ciu'ves in question form, in fact, a reseau ; in other words, they satisfy, in com-

--mon, i__Ji:-- 2 conditions in such a manner that through any two assumed points

only one curve passes. Thoy have, moreover, so many fixed (fundamcniar) points
in common that no two curves intersect iu more than one variable point. In short,

if, in general, .r^. denote the number of fundamental points which are multiple

points of the r-th order on every curve of the reseau, the following two equations

are satisfied :

x^-^-^x^+Gx^      n(n-\)^ Z»(»+3) _o

                                                                                                                         ':>

ari-l-4r,-l-9.r3  + (H-l)=.r,,_, = «^-l.

   This being premised, the property alluded to is, that the Jacobian of every such
reseau resolves itself into y^ right lines, y.^ conies, 7/3 cubics, &c., and y,,_i curves

--of the order w 1; where the integers y^, y.^, &c. also satisfy the above equations,

On a Generalization of the Method of Geometrical Inversion.
                      By T. A. HiEST, F.E.8.

It is well known that Steiner, by assuming, instead of a conic, any fimdamental

curve wiiatever, succeeded in generalizing Poncelet's theory of reciprocal polars.

The ordinary method of inversion is susceptible of a generalization of the same

Acharacter, and may then be appropriately termed Quantic Inversim.                                                            fixed origin

o being taken, the radius vector from it to any point p in the plane is, of course,
cut in {m--r) points p' by the ?--th polar oi p, relative to any fixed fundamental

Pcurve of the «i-th order. If p describe a 2>rimitive curve of the M-th order , it

Pcan readily be shown that its corresponding points p' will generate a curve                                                  of

the order mn (independent of ?·) which, amongst other singularities, always possesses

a multiple point at the origin of the order nr. The properties of the series of
(wi-- 1) inverse curves corresponding to any primitive w-ic, and relative to the
same origin and fundamental in-\c, formed the subject of the communication.

   "V\Tien m=2, the fimdamental curve is a conic which is intersected in two, real

or imaginarj', points Oj and o^ by the polar of the origin o. In this ease the first
and sole quadnc inverse of a given H-ic which passes a times through the origin o,
«i times through the point o,, and a.^ times through the point o,, is (if the sides of the

--principal triangle 00^ o^ be excluded) a cm-ve of the order (2n--a--a^ a,J, which
-- -- ----passes (n a^ a,) times through o,(n--a a^) thj-ough o^, and (w --a a.-^) through o^.

As a simple illustration of the utility of this special case of quantic inversion, when
employed as a method of transformation, it may bo rcmarlied that the number of
(double tangents to the quadric inverse curve, as determined by Pliicker's foTmiflfg',
is equal to the number of conies which can be drawn through three fixed points
SO as to have double contact with the primitive cm-ve. The results of quadric in-
version are identical with those obtained by the somewhat more general, but less

easily manipulated, transformations of Steiner and of Mag-nus. "VMien the funda-
mental curve is a circle around the origin, the fundamental poinds Oj, o^ coincide with

                                                                                                     1*

employed. When the fundamental curve is an equilateral h^^erbola, -^^dth its centre

       On Syniholical Expansions. By "W. H. L. Eussell, A.B., F.E.S.

   In this paper the author pointed out the connexion between his own binomial
theorems and the general theorems of symbolical development, given by Professor

Boole a long time ago. He also made some remarks upon the application of the

calculus of symbols to the integration of linear diflerential equations. It would
be interesting to know the real extent of the power of the calculus of symbols as
applied to the latter subject. It is certain that many differential equations known
to be integrable by other methods are solved with gi-eat facility b}' the calculus of
sjTnbols. The author particularly specified Laplace's equation, the well-known
equation occuning in investigations respecting the figure of the earth, and a dif-
ferential equation, integrated by Professor Stokes, relating to the pressure on rail-
way bridges. The most remarkable instance, however, was the equation known
as Pfaff 's equation, which was of considerable generality. In this case, as had
been ascertained by Professor Boole, the calcidus of symbols gave the same con-
ditions of integrability as had been previously ascertained by Pfaffj by an entirely

different process.

              On Methods of Detecting Clianges on the Moon's Surface.
                               By W. E. BiET, F.li.A.S.

   The author commenced by alluding to the theories that had been submitted for
explaining the appearances on the moon's surface. One, he said, had reference to
the fixity of those appearances ; so that how long soever observations might be
continued, no changes would be detected, all volcanic action on the surface (which

--appears to be admitted on aU hands) having long ago ceased the largest lunar

forms having been the result of the most violent outbreaks, the smaller mountains,

especially in the larger craters, indicating the last expiring efibi-ts of this action.

This theory, the author said, would not satisfy all minds ; and accordingly astro-

nomers were not wanting who leaned to the hypothesis that eruptive action still

exists, although in a subdued form.

   In order ultimately to set at rest the question as to whether the surface of the

moon is in a state of quiescence or activity, the author recommended the fonua-

tion of a catalogue of lunar objects, remarking that our existing records were

inadequate to determine the question. He gave instances of lunar craters figured

as far back as 1792, by the astronomer Schroter, which have been entirely over-
looked by Beer and Madler, and consequently omitted in their map, which is the
acknowledged authority in lunar matters. These craters, the author said, he had
himself seen very recently ; and in order to assist in detecting futiu-e changes, should
there be any, he had abeady commenced a catalogue in which 386 objects were
entered, many of them very small.

On tlie Possihillty of constructing Ellipsoidal Lenses.

            By the Eev, Thomas Fuelong.

If a circular disk be put in a convenient position, and a line be supposed pro-

ceeding- from its centre, and pei-pendicular to its plane, an eye placed in that line

vdll see the dislc as a circle. If the plate be made to revolve on one of its dia-

meters through a right angle, it will be seen edgeways as a line ; as the disk so
moves through 90°, the eye will perceive it assimie eveiy form of ellipse, from the
circle, its limit on the one hand, to the right line, its limit on the other. The

elements of those elliptic forms are easily foimd ; for the radius of the disk is
always the semiaxis major, and the uatiu-al cosine of the angle through which

the disk (or the eye) moves midtiplied by the number of inches or feet in the

radius of the disk will be the semiaxis minor, from which, if the focus be given,

the angle of revolution can be foimd, or, if the angle be given, the focus may be

found ; or, easier still, to the tto ^^ ^^ ^^ inch, by measuring off those numbers on

the legs of a right angle on a scale of equal parts. The common slide-rest has

two motions, one parallel to the bed of the lathe, the other at right angles to it

and if a cutting-tool be an-anged as for boring a cylinder, that cutter will produce

a cylindrical groove if the work attached to the slide-rest be moved parallel to the

Nowbed, or a line (like the cut of a circular saw) if moved across the bed.  if

the upper part of the slide-rest be made capable of moving in azimuth 90°, the

cutting point, moving in a circle, can be made to produce grooves corresponding

to the small end of the ellipse, or, by a vertical arrangement to the flatter side, ot

any eccentricity required. Crossed lenses, gTOund and polished in circidar grooves

(the discovery of a French gentleman, he believed), are well known and valued for

flatness of field and good definition. His strong impression is that elliptic lenses

could be produced in the same way. The only point of difference is that, while

the circular groove permits the glass to be worked in it in various positions, the

elliptic groove must have the glass worked in it always in the same plane. The

aper read was not intended for the learned, but for a plain workman, and in the

hiope that some one would try the experiment. The author feels confident that, if

ellipsoidal curves were introduced, gi'eat advantages are likely to arise.

On the possible Connexion hetween the Ellipticity of Mars and the general

   Appearatice of its Surface. By Professor Hennesst, F.It.S., M.B.I.A.

   The physical characters of Mars have attracted considerable notice, on account
of the supposed resemblance of that planet to our earth, and at the same tirne one

of the most prominent of these characters presents a striking contrast with its
terrestrial counterpart, namely, its ellipticity, which is estimated by most astro-
nomers at a higher value than mechanical theory would assign, if the planet had

been originally in a fluid state. In accordance with hydrostatical laws, a planet
similar to Mars, and rotatory around its axis in the same period of time, should

have an ellipticity very nearly approaching to that of our earth. Two observers

of great eminence, Bessel and Johnson, seem to have arrived at a similar con-
clusion. The observations made by the former were fully discussed by M. Oude-
manns in the ' Astronomische Nachrichten,' No. 838, p. 352. After combining
the results of different observed diameters with various angles of position, by the
method of least squares, Oudemanns came to the conclusion that the observations
gave varied and uncertain values for the diameters; and therefore that it was
permissible to regard the planet as approximately spherical. Johnson, in the
Kadcliffe Obsen'ations for 1850 and 1853, discussed the results of measurements
made with the heliometer, and arrived at substantiallj^ the same result. Although

the late M. Arago referred to some of the author's views regarding terrestrial
physics, as probably affording explanation for the anomaly of the large ellipticity

which he assigned to Mars, in his posthumous publication on the structure of the
·B REPORT 1864.

planet, the author had heard the same eminent person express views almost
identical Avith those flo-wdng fi'om the observations of Bessel and Johnson. At the
same time, the simplification which the author endeavoured to introduce into the
theory of the Earth's figm-e will not, if aiDplied to that of Mars, suffice to accoimt
for the usually received high cUipticity oi that body. Abstaining, for the present,
from any attempt at an explanation of this pecidiarity, let ua endeavour to trace
out its consequences ^vith reference to the configuration of that planet. It seems
to he generally admitted that there is, in the neighbourhood of one of the poles of
'Mars, a great mass of brilliant matter, analogous to a mass of terresti-ial snow.
This very sidostance is even supposed, ndth gTeat probability, to seriously inter-
fere with the accm-acy of telescopic observations, owing to the optical disturb-
ances arising from the in-adiation of such an extremely bright object. It is also
manifest that, if this substance should be snow, the vtimng seasons of the planet
would cause its dimensions to vary, and thus the power of the disturbing in-
fluence. These circumstances show that great caution should be used in accepting
any results which are liable to be afffected by the presence of this snowy patch,
and they also necessarily imply the existence of a fluid like water in that part of
the smface of Mars wherever the temperature is above the fi'eezing-point of the
fluid. If this shoidd be so, the geuerallj' assumed large ellipticity of Mars should
be followed by another residt. Several years ago, when controverting and dis-
proA-ing an erroneous theory of the Earth's figm-e, put forward by Plaj-fair, and
which has since acquired some importance by being reproduced by Sir John
Herschel, in support of his general views, and appealed to by Sir Charles Lj-ell,
the author obtained mathematical expressions for the equilibriiun of a fluid like
water spread over an exterior abraded spheroid such as this theory assumed the
Eai'th to be. It follows from these expressions that if the Earth possessed a very
small ellipticity, or were spherical, it woidd consist of two gi-eat circumpolar

continents, with an intermediate belt of equatorial ocean. He has assigned the

dimensions of these continents, supposing the ocean to have its present volume.
It also immediately follows that if the Earth had a very great ellipticity, such,
for example, as that so frequently assumed for Mars, the reverse would take place,
and the diy land would foi-m an equatorial belt, while the poles would be
enveloped in water. The dimensions of these circumpolar oceans, with the
assumed ellipticity of Mars, could be also assigned, and they should exist on its
surface, imless there should be great in-egidarities in the density of the matter
composing the planet. The mechanical theory on which these conclusions are

based is simple, and therefore the attention of obsen-ers may be directed to the

inquiry as to whether, compared with oiu- Earth, a greater predominance of dry
land exists at the equatorial parts of Mars compared to its polar regions. If the
author might venture to draw auy conclusion fi-om the results hitherto obsen-ed,
and especially from the dia'^'ings appended to Mr. Lockj-er's paper, in the
' Memoirs of the Astronomical Society',' he would say that no such predominance
of equatorial land exists on the smfaee of Mars, and therefore if its appearances

are partly due to the presence of a liquid on its surface, we must conclude that ita

ellipticity has been generally exaggerated, and that the results of Bessel and
Johnson's observations are, upon the whole, nearer to the truth than those of

other observers.

Madler, appropriated the term " Montes Hercynii," at the same time transferring
the name " Lichtenberg " to a crater some little distance from this plain. Dr. Lee
illustrated his description of the plain and irs surrounding mountains by copies of

mfoiu- delineations, which, with the one on Lohrmann's map, are all that are exist-

ence--one by Schriitor, made in the year 1792 ; the portion of Beer and Miidler's
map of this legion ; a iino drawing: of the northern part of the plain by Lord llosse ;
and an unpublished drawing by Mr. Birt, executed during tlje present year. In
these drawings. Dr. Lee pointed out the features that were common to them, espe-
cially a large crater on the north part of the west wall, which was very conspicuous
in them all. The west wall Dr. Lee remarked is tlie most i-ateresting of the two
principal ones which bound the plain. This wall is shown by Schioter as being
perforated by fom craters, including the conspicuous one above mentioned. Of
these craters the author said Beer and Miidler have but one on their large map.

LordRosse's drawings of a part of the chain only have the nearest to the large crater,
and Mr. Birt appears to have observed the four given by Schrciter. After alluding
to the confusion likely to arise from the changes in the names before mentioned,
Dr. Lee suggested that in future this large plain should be denominated " Otto

Struve," as "commemorative of the extensive astronomical labours of the asti'ononier
of Pulkova ; and that the crater to which Beer and Madler gave the name " Lich-
tenberg" should still retain it, especially as, according to theGerman selenographers,

it is almost unir[uo in exhibiting on some occasions a red tint.

               Notice of the Physkal Aspect of the Sun.

            By Professor Phillips, M.A., LL.D., F.E.S.

Since the author had been provided with the diagonal sim-glass adjusted to his

equatorial by Mr. Cooke, he had taken many occasions for scrutinizing the aspect

of the sun's disk in regard to spots, faeulre, and the general porosity of the surface.

For tracing the path of a spot across the disk, a Kellner eyepiece was employed,

with five engraved transit lines, the intervals being equal to 10° in the central

part of the sun's circumference. In drawing, negative eyepieces of the ordinary-

kind were sometimes employed ; at others, a pecidiar kind, arranged by himselt,
with powers varying from 75 to SOO, the best performances being usually between

100 and 200; the higher powers, however, being occasionally usefid towards the

limb of the sun. He described the bright streaks or faculte as of diversified form
and distinct outline, either entirely separate or coalescing in various ways into
ridges and network. When the spots became invisible near the limb, the undu-

lated shining ridges and folds still indicated their place, being more remarkable

thereabout than elsewhere on the limb, though almost everywhere traceable in

good observing weather. In a diagram made on the 29th of March last, faculae

are slfown in the most brilliant parts of the sun. They appear of all magnitudes,

from barely discernible, softly gleaming spots a thousand miles long, to continuous,

complicated, and heaped ridges 40,000 and more miles in length, and 1000 to

4000 miles and more broad. They are never regidarly arched, and never found

in straight bands, but always devious and minutely undulated, like clouds in the

evening^sky or very distant ranges of snowy mountains. When minutely studied,
the ridges appear prominent in cusps and depressed into hollows. By the frequent

meeting of the briglit ridges, spaces of the sim's siuface are included of various

magnitudes, and forms somewhat corresponding to the areas and forms of the

irregular spots with penumbraj. Ridges of this kind often embrace and enclose a

spot, though not very closelv, the spot appearing the more conspicuous from the

surrounding brightness ; but sometimes there appeara a broad white platform

round the spot, and from this the white crumpled ridges pass in various directions.

Towards the limb the ridges appear nearly parallel to it ; further off this cha-

racter  is  exchanged  for  indet«i-minate  direction  and  lessened  distinctness                                                       over the

rest of -the siuface they are less conspicuous, but can be traced as an iiTegular net-

work, more or less disg'uised by that structure which has been designated as porosity.

The faculaj preserve their shapes and position, with no visible change, during a
few hours of observation, and probably for much longer periods. They do not

--appear to project beyond the general circular outline of the sun a circumstanc-e

which the author explains, without denying that they actually do rise above the
                                                                                                                             ;

general surface, whether as clouds or mountains, to either of which they may be
truly likened. In respect to porosity, the author had also devoted much time to

a scrutiny of the interspaces between the faculre towards the limb and the general
surface towards the interior of the disk. Towards the interior the ground acquires
more evident lights and shades, a sort of granulation difficult to analyze. Under
favourable conditions for observation, there appears little or none of that tremor

and internal motion described by earlier observers. What is then seen is a com-

plicated surface of interrupted lights and shades, the limits of which appear

arched, or straight, or confused, according to the case; and the indeterminate
union of these produces sometimes faint luminous ridges, the intervals tilled up by
shaded interstices and insulated patches of iUmniuated surface. The best resem-
blance to these complicated small surfaces of light and shade he had been able to
procure was a disk of a particular sort of white paper placed near the eye-end of
the telescope, and seen by transmitted light. Heaps of small fi-agments of white
substances, not so imiform in figure or equal in size as rice-grains, might also be
suggested for comparison.

On a susjyected Change of Bnglitness in the Lunar Si^ot, Werner.

Bij the Rev. T. W. Webb, A.M., F.R.A.S.

The mysterious appearance of the Moon under high illumination, and the want of

accordance between its actual relief and what may be called its local colourimj, have

by no means received a degree of attention corresponding with the present position

and requirements of science, or with the unprecedented optical resources now at

our command. The investigation would no doubt present many difficulties, but
we ought not to be thus deterred from attempting the solution oif so interesting a

question ; and a more persevering and minute examination of the topogi'aphy of

the full Moon could scarcely fail of meeting with its reward in a well-marked ad-

vance in the boimdary of our knowledge. One probable result might be the dis-

covery of variation in the brightness of the lummous markings. No reason can be

given for acquiescing in the general supposition of their permanence, except the

testimony of very inadequate representations. The changes remarked by Schriiter

and Gruithuisen are periodical, and therefore of another character ; but a suspicion
has begim to be entertained of more permanent alteration. Messrs. Birt and Hunter

(the Earl of Rosse's obseiwer), as well as the present wi-iter, have found the interiot

oi Plato different fi-om the representation of Beer and Miidler; and the object of

this paper is to bring forward evidence of another change, in the interior of the

Acrater Werner.  small luminous spot at the foot of the wall on the N.E. side has

been twice referred to by Beer and Madler, in the most distinct and positive man-

ner, as equalling the brightness of Aristarchus, and surpassing in this respect every

other portion of the lunar disk. Such, according to the observations of the present

writer, is no longer the case. In 1855 and 1856 its comparative inferiority was

noticed with two achromatics of  3-7 inches aperture                                                                         and during the present year,
                                                                                                                          ;

a careful investigation with a 5'5-inch object-glass imder very various angles of in-

cident light, with many magnifying powers, and the occasional emplojanent of

coloured screen-glasses, leads to the same conclusion. So far from rivalling the

intensity oi Aristarchm, it never equalled that ot Proclus, Censorinus, or Dionydus,

all which are rated lower by Beer and Madler. From its position it does not seem

likely that other circimistances of libration would influence its apparent brightness

and since Beer and Madler have studied the vicinity with especial minuteness

(much more than they have bestowed on some other regions), it appears highly

probable that the spot has decreased in brilliancy during the lapse of twenty years.

A careful examination of other districts might probably detect similar changes.

For this purpose, in place of vague and arbitrary estimations, a method of sequences

similar to that adopted by Su* J. Herschel in stellar photometry might prove of

great service, and coloured screen-glasses of various depths would be usefid ; but

care must be taken to discriminate between the impressions of extent and intensity,

and to avoid fragmentary comparisons with imequal apertures, as it is probable

that the decrease of differences in apparent brightness with increasing light, which

J8 known to obtain in the case of stars, may find place also in these observations.

   Assuming' tte con-ectness, or at least probability', of Hansen's assertion that tlie

centres of iigm-e and grayity of the Moon are not coincident, and that consequently

a difi'erent condition, both as to surface and atmosphere, might possibly obtain on

its remoter side, an attempt was made to inqiiire whether there is any evidence of

progressive change in proportion as v^-e recede from the centre of the visible hemi-

sphere                             and it was shown that though there are departures of more than one kind
                                ;

towards the limb from the types of form prevailing in the centre of the disk, yet

those variations are not suihciently consistent to lead to any reliable inference ; and

that on the whole it is not possible, from what we see, to form any satisfactory

conclusion as to the condition of the invisible region.

On a New Form of !S])ectroscope, in u'Mch Direct Vision is obtained with a
                          Single Prism. By J. Beowning.

   Some time since it was suggested to the author by Mr. Huggins that a du-ect-
vision spectroscope, more powerfid than Iloffhian's, would be a valuable addition
to the iusti-uments used for spectrum analysis. If made portable for travellers, it
could be used in the manner of a telescope for observing differences in the solar

spectrum at various elevations, for the spectra of flames, the absoi-ption-bands
produced hj different liqiuds ; and, above all, it would be most readily adaptable
to telescopes for examining the spectra of stars. "Whilst the author was engaged

on various contrivances having this end in view, Mr. A. Herschel showed him a
single prism he had contrived, which answered the pui-pose. It was of the form
that has been teiined 3 to 1 right-angled, from the hypothenuse being three times
as large as the base. These proportions are very simple and easy of execution.
In this prism, which was of crovm glass 2'.5 specific gravity, refraction occurs both

in the ray of light entering at the face perpendicidar to the short side, but near
the point, and also on its leaving the prism by the short face, the correction of the

inclination of the ray, so as to make it emerge in the same line as it enters, being
effected by its perfomiing trvo internal reflexions. In making this kind of prism
of very dense flint glass, the author had foimd the task more diflicult than he had
anticipated : the acute angle rec[uii-ed considerable modification, and it became veiy
difficult to keep the path of the ray within the prism. The best residts had been
obtained by throwing the ray to the left of the prism, and correcting this by cement-
ing a small crown-glass prism to the short face. The refractive angle, exercising a

--contrary dispersion, need not be more than 5° scarcely more than a tenth of that

employed by Hoffman in his constniction. The three sm-faces of this prism, being
in use, must be all equally ti-ue, or the definition suflers. After the residt of all the
experiments he had made, the author would wish to express his conviction that
whatever advantages maj^ be gained on the score of portability or convenience in
use, they were more than coimterbalanced by the inferior performance of these
arrangements, when compared "wath plain prisms of the best workmanship. In
connexion with this paper, the author added some remarks on the great difficulty
encountered in workmg plane surfaces on extra-dense glass prisms, and exhibited
two wonderfully delicate instruments for measxmng the irregularities. With the
first, inequalities of o-q J-to of ^^ mch. could be taken by direct reading, and of
 go^oo of an inch by estimation ; with the second, inequalities of the xo owoo- of
an inch were discoverable. The common method is to take the reflexion of a
distant image through a telescope ; but the prisms Mr. Browning has producad
fully justify his choice of du-ect mechanical means for proving the perfection of

their surface-planes.

    On the Connexion between the Form and Optical Properties of Crystals.

                                                    Bij A. Catton.

   It was the object of this paper to give an account of the results of investigations
which have had for their object the discovery of the connexion between the form
and optical properties of ciystals. It is believed that, in the results here given,
some of the principal difficulties of this important proljlem have been overcome.
The first step towards the solution of this problem was made by Su' David Brewster

in 1818. He discovered that crystals belonging to the prismatic, oblique, and

anorthic systems are biaxal ; those belonging to the pyramidal and rhombohedral
systems imiaxal ; while crystals of the cubic system do not possess double refrac-
tion (a fact which had been previously stated by Hauy). Li this paper is con-
sidered iu detail the connexion between the form and optical properties of crystals
belonging to the prismatic system. The investigation of the optical properties of

--ciystals belonging to the oblique system is still in progress. The following is the

method employed in this investigation: Each crystal is referred to three rect-

angular axes, one axis being perpendicidar to the plane of the optic axes, the other

two being the internal and external bisectors of the angle between the optic axes.
The new parameters are calculated by means of formulae investigated in a paper on
the " Rhombohedral system ; " and thence the angle between the optic axes is
found, as if the crjstal belonged to the prismatic sj^stem, by means of the formula)
given in this paper. The angle between the optic axes of one mineral belonging
to the oblique system has been calculated by this process ; and the calcidated has
been found to agTee approximately with the observed angle. If this should prove
to be o'enerally the case, it will not only be a solution of the problem which lorms
the suljject of this note for crystals of the oblique system, but it mil prove that
these crystals are formed according to the same laws of symmetry as crystals of the

prismatic system.

                      Photo-SmJpture. By A. Claudet, F.B.S.

   After having explained the advantages of photography and its progress, tho
author described in what manner it has been applied to sculpture.

   This beautiful application of photography is called Photo- Sculjiture, and is the
invention of M. WiUeme, an eminent French scidptor.

   The story of tho invention may be told in a few words. M. Willome was in the

habit, whenever he could procure photographs of his sitters, of endeavouring to

commimicate to the model the correctness of those unerring types. But how should

he raise the outlines of flat pictm-os into a solid form ?
   Yet these single photographs, such as they were, could serve hira to measure

exactly profile outlines. He could, indeed, by means of one of the points of a

pantograph, follow the outline of tho photograph, while, with the other point
directed on the model, he ascertained and corrected any error which had been

communicated to his work diuing the modelling. What he could do with one

view, or one single photograph of the sitter, he might do also with several other
views, if he had them. This was sufficient to open the inquiry oi an ingenious

mind. He saw at once that if he had photographs of many other profiles of the

sitter, taken at the same moment, by a number of cameras-obscuras placed around,
he might alternately and consecutively correct his model by comparing the pro-
file outline of each photograph with the corresponding- outline of the model. Such
was the origin of this discovery. But it soon naturally occuiTed to him that, in-
stead of correcting his model when nearly completed, he had better work at once
with the pantograph upon the rough block of clay, and cut it out gradually all round
in following one after the other the outline of each of the photographs.

   Now supposing that he had twenty-four photographs, representing the sitter in as

many points of view (all taken at once), he had but to turn the bloclc of clay, after
eveiT operation, -^V^b of the base upon which it is fixed, and to cut out the next
profile, imtil the block had completed its entire revolution, and then the clay was

--transformed into a perfect solid figure of the twenty-four photographs the statue

or bust was made.
   As an illustration of the process, the author has executed a bust of the President

of the Association, Sir Charles Lyell, which was exhibited to the Section.

Oil fJie Adaptation of Bisulijliide-of-Garhon Prisms, and the itse of Telescopes

  of Long Focal Distance, in the Examination of the Sun's Sjiectrum. By

   J. P. Gassiot, F.R.S.

The dispersive power of sulphide of carbon lias caused it to be generally

used for producing the spectrum ; and some time since the author had a battery

of eleven prisms constructed, which has been used at the Kew ObserAatory in ob-
Dserving the spectrum of the sim. By means of this apparatus, the double line

was observed in a very remarkable manner, presenting an angular separation of

3' 6", while at the same time eleven other associated lines were counted which had

not pre-\-iously been detected. But although this great augidar separation is a

proof of the power of the instnuneut, spectrum observations made with sulphide-

of-carbon prisms are attended with dithculties of the most perplexing and often

annoying character. One of these is the necessity of readjusting their positiou

whenever ditlerent portions of the spectrmu have to be examined, the time thus

occupied being often fatal to the seeming of true and faithful residts. Another

and serious difficidty arises from the changes of temperature taking place during the

period of observation. The author had been informed by Mr. Browning that Prof.

Cook, of New York, who had a battery of nine prisms, made by Alvan Clarke,

had found the influence of temperature so great as to render the batteiy unser-

viceable for long-continued and exact investigations. In order to test the effects

of changes of temperature upon Mr. Gassiot's batteiy, a careful observation was

Amade of the lines discovered in the space between the double lines of D.  tin

vessel containing hot water waa placed on the plate in the centre of the battery,

the heat from which soon affected the iluid in the prisms, and the spectral lines

gi-adually became confused and indistinct, travelling at the same time rapidly

across the field of view ; several hours elapsed before the prisms resumed their

nomial state. The fluid prisms are, notwithstanding all diflicidties in using them,

the author considered, an indispensable and most valuable adjunct to a complete

spectroscope, as, by the enormous dispersive povrer of this sulphide, observations

of Imes in the spectrum are obtainable that otherwise would probably entirely

escape notice ; and if, as in the battery which Mr. Browning had constructed

for him, the prisms have surfaces so perfectly plane as, at equable temperatures, to

give such satisfactory definition, they become highly valuable for the purposes of

comparison, and thus of determining in a remarkable manner the coincidence of

certain lines, the acciu-acy of the results not being interfered with, as it is evident

both sets of lines Avould be equally affected. The observers at Kew believe they

have noticed the coincidence of several bright gold lines with corresponding dark

lines in the solar spectrum, fi'om which the presence of that metal may he infeiTed

in the sun's atmosphere. If confirmed by further obsoi-vations, this \nl\ be an im-

portant addition to our present knowledge. In order to increase the power of the

author's unequalled battery of flint-glass prisms, Mr. Browning has recently adapted

a pair of telescopes of three feet focal length, in place of those of two feet, for-

merly used. The improvement thus effected is very striking; and on the only

opportunity for using it, the solar spectrum assumed an appearance f;ir more nearly

resembling that obtained by the batteiy of fluid prJsms. This single observation,

however, has been enough to show that the employment of telescopes of long

focal length may be indispensable for minute and reliable research on the lines

in the solar spectmm.

        On the Transmission of the Red Ray by many Coloured Solutions.
                               By Dr. Gladstone, F.R.S.

   The author has been in the habit of observing the absorption of the different parts
of the prismatic spectrum by coloured liquids, by allowing a line of light to pass
through the varying thicknesses of the liquid contained in a hollow wedge of glass
and analyzing it by a prism. From the diagrams representing the phenomena thus
produced, it was evident that in many cases the extreme red ray was capable of
penetrating very far, while the less refrangible red or orange ray was almost imme-

--diately absorbed. The following instances were given : Solutions of chromium
                                                                                          ;

salts, m-anous salts, permanganates, blue salts of cobalt, ferric sulpbocyanide,

siilphindigotic acid, litmus, azuliue, chinoliue blue, bleu de Paris, ceruleine, acid

nitrosonaphtbaline, cochuieal, chloropliyll, and the pm-jjle colom- produced by the
action of a sidphide on a nitroprasside. These solutions were exhibited ; and two

--of them, litmus and chinoline blue, being placed in the hollow glass wedges,

showed the phenomena of dichromatism that is, the thin part of the wedge of liquid
was blue, the middle part pm-ple, while the thick part was red. This is due to the
fi-ee transmission of the red ray, while the other parts of the spectrum are more
qiuckly absorbed. Several of the other liquids are dichromatic from the same cause
for instance, the salts of chromium, which are either gi-een or red, according to the

quantity seen through. No probable cause was assigned for this double peculiarity

--the very fr-ee transmission of the red ray, and the speedy absoiirtion of the neigh-

bouring nxy ; nor did the author see any chemical relationship between the sub-

stances that exhibit it.

                   On ilie Spectra of some of tJie Heavenhj Bodies.

     By Professor "W. A. Hixiee, V.P.R.S., and W.'Hfggins, F.B.A.S.

The fii-st part of the commimication related to observations on planetaiy spectra.

It was necessary to compare these spectra side by side with that of the sun ; but

liere arose a difficulty, for a planet is not usually visible until simset. Ultimately

the plan adopted was to compare the light of the planet with that of the sim

reflected from the sky in the immediate vicinity of the planet, just after the sim

had sunk below the horizon. The object of this comparison was chiefly to ascertain

whether the sun's light, after being reflected from a planet, and having passed

through a portion of its atmosphere, contains any of those lines of absorption which

are produced in the solar spectrum when the rays of the sun traverse a large extent

of om- earth's atmosphere. This was found to bo the case, and one line in particular

was much more powerfully developed by the atmosphere of Jupiter than by that

of our earth. The colour of the light of Mars was in like manner foimd to be due

to absoi-ption exercised by something in the atmosphere of that planet.

The second part of the communication refen-ed to the spectra of binary stars.

These are most difficult of observation, as the two members of the system are so

very near one another that it is difficvdt to obtain the spectrum of one without the

other. This difficidty was, however, overcome in some cases, where the stars were

not extremely close, by rotating the spectroscope in the tube of the telescope until

the  slit  for  admitting  the  light was at right  angles to the line joining  the  two  stars
                                                                                                              ;

the coloiu-ed appearance presented by some of these interestiag bodies was foimd

to be produced by peculiar absorption of certain parts of the spectinmi, similar to

that which, on a small scale, is produced by the atmosphere of our liuninary.

The third and most remarkable part of this communication was that which re-

fen-ed to the spectra of nebulae ; and the observations in this field were stated to
have been conducted solely by Mr. Huggins. The nebidaj examined were chiefly

those denominated planetary nebulae. It was scarcely expected that the extremely

faint light of these bodies would be sufficient to produce any spectrum at all ; nor

would it have done so had theii- construction been that which has been usually

assigned to them. But to the sui-prise of the observer he beheld, not a continuous

spectrum such as that which proceeds from a solid body interspersed with dark

lines due to atmospheric absoi-ption, but a specti'um consisting of a few bright lines

such as that which proceeds from an intensely heated gas. It was, indeed, the

smallness in number of these component lines that enabled any success to be ob-

tained ; and the result fr-om three or four of these nebulffi revealed the fact that
thev were in each case composed of glowing gas, probably hydrogen and nitrogen,

without any solid nucleus whatever. But what can be the origin of this high

temperature, since, iipon the principle of the conservation of energy, some other form

of motion must be destroyed in order to produce the luminosity ? The origin of the

light of the heavenly bodies thus becomes more pei-plexing than ever, and seems to

point to some law regarding which we are jot in the dark.

   In a letter which appeared in the 'Athenaeum' of September 3, the writer described
the appearance of a splendid solar rainbow, and its " reflected image " in the Lake
of Lucerne. This was an instance, seen imder very favoiu'able circumstances (from
the calmnesa of the water, the low altitude of the sun, and the elevation of the observer
above the siuface of the lake), of that secondary iris, to the rationale of which the
author had drawn the attention of the Section at the Aberdeen Meeting, 1859.

 Description of a Clieap Form of Automatic Regulator for the Electric Light.

                             By Samuel Highlet, F. G.S.

   The principle of this " Pneumatic Electric Eegulator " was suggested to the
author by Mr. Maiden. The instrument is sensitive in action, and, from its
simplicity, little liable to get out of order, and can be arranged for any length of
carbon. The rod supporting the upper carbon is attached to a copper float, which
rests upon a colunm of water, contained in a chamber communicating by an opening
with an air-chamber, from which a pipe, terminated by a flexible tube of vulcanized
rubber, is carried imder a wedge-shaped piece attached to the rod holding the lower
carbon, and which passes through a coil of stout insidated wire. ,"When the carbons
are brought into contact, the current passes through, and the coil becomes magnetic,
pulls down the ii'on core, and separates the carbons, so as to produce the proper
arc of light, at the same time forcing down the wedge upon the flexible tube,
closing it as eflectuaUy as with a stop-cock. As soon as the distance between the
poles becomes too great for the cm-rent to pass freely, the coil ceases to be magnetic,
and the lower rod is raised slightly by means of a lever and countei-poise spring.
Air is thus forced from the chamber by the column of water ; the float sinks,
bringing down the upper carbon into contact with the lower one : the cm'rent is
thus again completed ; the coil becomes magnetic, and pulls down the iron core,
pressing the stop-cock wedge upon the rubber tube. These operations are repeated

sympathetically as the carbon bm-ns away.

On the Retardation of Electrical Signals on Land-Lines.
                     By Pleeming Jenkin-.

The retardation of electrical signals through submarine cables has been studied

closely for some years                                                                                                     but on land-lines,  owing to the difficulty  of the experiment
                                                                                                                        ;

and small influence of the retardation on the signals usually employed, little atten-

tion has been paid to the phenomenon. The invention of automatic instruments,

such as Prof. Wheatstone's transmitting

signals, which succeed one another with

great rapidity, now renders the retardation

an important element of calculation, even

on the common aerial lines. The electi-ic

current is never received at a distant sta-

tion at the very instant of its transmis-

sion ; it arrives gradually, as represented

in the annexed curve, in which the hori-

zontal ordinates represent the times after
the cfrcuit has been completed in terms

of a quantity a ; while the vertical ordi- "

nates represent the relative strengths of the current at each moment : thus on

any circuit the received cm-rent will have reached about 65 per cent, of its whole
strength after a period of 6a. The quantity a varies with the circumstances of each

case, and is equal to -^log^^^gj, where A=the resistance of the conducting wire

per unit of length, in electrostatic absolute measure ; c tlie capacity per unit of

length in the same measure ; and I the total length of the wire ; k is known for all

the ordinary metals, but c has hitherto been undetermined ; and the object of the
paper was to deduce the value of c, from some experiments made by JI. Guillemin,
and fully detailed in the ' Annales de Physique et de Chiniie ' for 1860. These

experiments gave with considerable accuracy the form of the cuiTe for various

lengths ; but the experimenter had not applied his results so as to give the con-
stants required for the mathematical theory. After describing the method employed

by M. Guillemin with high commendation, Mr. Jeukin gave the results of his cal-
culations. The electrostatical capacity per foot of the common No. 8 wire in the

lines used by M. Guillemin must have been from 0-15 to 0-22 in British absolute
electrostatic measure (feet, gi-ains, seconds). This number is nearly three times

that given by pure theory for a wire, stretched horizontally, without supports, at

--a uniform b eight of ten feet from the ground a discrepancy probably to be ac-

counted for by the induction occurring at each post. The form of the curve was

--also modified" by imperfect insulation. The retardation due to the statical charge

the capacity for which is thus determined not oidy delays the signals, but causes
Aconfusion and utter illegibility if they succeed each other too rapidly.
                                                                           limit is

thus put to the perfonnance of signalling-instruments ; and calculations made with

the above value of c show that we must not expect to transmit by the common

Morse instrument more than about twenty words per minute between stations loOO

miles apart ; that the performance of Prof. Wheatstone's beautiful automatic ti-ans-

mitter may be limited to speeds below 120 words per minute when 530 miles fire

exceeded ;" and that the Chevalier Bonelli would have to diminish his speed of 400

words per minute '(with five wires), even on considerably shorter circmts. It must

be remembered that larger wires, fewer posts, and a better form of insulator may

considerably extend these limits.

Description of an Electric-resistance Balance constructed by Prof. W. Thomson.
                                  By FiEBimfG Jenkin.

  The author described an instrument made under the superintendence of Prof. W.

Thomson, of Glasgow, for the purpose of practically carrying out the iniportnnt
improvements in the methods of comparing the electric resistances of short thick
bars of wires of metal, as described in a paper by Prof. Thomson, published in the
' Philosophical Magazine.' The special merits of the method are, that the bars or
wires to be tested do not require to be cut to any definite length, that they do not
require to be soldered or joined by amalgamated terminals to the connexions of
the instrument, and that any resistance due to slightly imperfect connexion between
the bar tested and these connexions does not vitiate the measurements. This im-
portant practical improvement, by which the accuracy of the measurement and the
ease with which it can be effected are alike increased, was explained by reference
to the fine instrument exhibited, which has been constructed for Col. Douglas,
Superintendent of the Telegraphs in India, by Mr. James White, of Glasgow.

vented; certain modifications being introduced to provide against tilting and other
emergencies occurring during the motion of the ship. Tbe distinctive principle of

On the Mechanical TJieory and Application of the Laivs of Magnetic
            Induction and Electricity. Bij J. B. Thompson.

In this paper electricity and magnetism were considered as a force in the same

way as heat and light ; and electi'ic and magnetic induction were treated in corre-

--spondence with mechanics. The summaiy of the author's theories is : That the

phenomena called electricity and magnetism are two forms of force which may

either be in conatus or in act.          If in conatus, they are in                                                            a state  of  tension                                     if in
                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

act, then in a state of fluxion. Electricity is in conatus when in the static form of

excitation, or when the voltaic          circuit  is         not   completed                                                   in  act, when the  matter
                                                                                                                            ;

highly excited is brought in contact with matter less highly excited, or when the

voltaic circuit is completed. Magnetism is in conatus when the magnetic vortical

sphere is held constant by a constant electric cmTent, or by hardened steel or mag-

netic iron ore, so that the earth-magnetism may flow in ; in act, on its electric projec-

tion and recession, or when iron or some other paramagnetic is moved through this

sphere. That electric conduction is by certain molecular movements of particidar por-

tions of matter. Those wherein this movement is easily excited are called conductors,

and those wherein it is with difficulty excited are called insulators. That magnetic

conduction is by the symmetrical an-angement into a vortical sphere of spirals of a

general medium, which pervades all matter, and holds it in that foiin for the time

being. That particular matter wherein the sphere is easily excited is called para-

magnetic, and that wherein it is with more difficidty excited is called diamagnetic.

That this sphere can be fixed by means of hardened steel or magnetic iron ore. That

the magnetic vortical can be excited by means of spiral cuiTcnts of electricity

generally, and even by a tangent to such spiral. Also it can be induced by mag-

netic conduction in paramagnetics. That the magnetic force is only in a state of

fluxion on the projection and recession of this sphere. That this sphere is pro-

jected in the direction of the exciting electi-ic cun-ent, and recedes in the opposite
direction. That the electric force is induced on the projection of the magnetic vor-
tical, and also on its recession. That, consequently, for one inducing current there
are two induced currents ; therefore, it would appear that by induction electric ex-
citation is multiplied. Finally, that these inductions and conversions of force are
in strict accordance with the laws of mechanical motion. In connexion with the
paper an induction machine was exhibited, the chief points of novelty in which ap-

--pear to be these : that it is self-acting ; the current of voltaic electricity which

adjusted that the quantity and intensity of the induced current shall range from
that of 10 DanieU's cells to that of 1000, and this without emplojing more than

three or four cells. These are valuable properties to electricians who are engaged

in experiments with electricity of high or even moderately high tension. Besides,

it is applicable to whatever batteries are, liavmg been used experimentally for tele-
graphy and for electro-depositing. For telegi-aphy through submarine and subter-

raneous cables there appears to have been a great objection to induction machines,

or rather induction coils. The objection was, that these induction coils sent their

electricity through the cables in sudden intense shocks, which injured the insulation

of the cable. In this machine it is apparently a continuous flow, and no spark vdW

jump from one electi'odeto the other, unless first brought in contact, as in batteries.

Meteokologt.

On a New Anemometer. By C. 0. F. Caxok, M.A.

The object of this instrument is to obtain, by tbe wind acting on one suiface

only, a daily curve of its pressure in pounds on an area of a sq[uare foot, and the

number of miles travelled by it iu a horizontal direction in twenty-fom- hours, or

any other given time, and thence its houi-ly velocity. The surface upon which

the wind acts, or the pressm-e-plate, is the base of a cone, the axis of which is

horizontal, and the area of the base equal to one square foot, the object of the

cone being to offer as little resistance as possible that may be due to any air on the

leeward side of the plate, and to neutralize the effect of any vacuum formed behind

it. The pressure-plate is attached to the end of a horizontal bar, and with it is

moved backwards and forwards, the bar resting on friction-rollers ; this is the only

portion of the instrument out-of-doors and exposed to the weather, and is connected

by a chain and steel rod with the rest of the instrument within the biulding on

which the anemometer is fixed. The pressure of the w-ind is measm-ed by two

cm-ved levers of equal length acting against each other, their motion being in a ver-

tical plane. At one end of the upper lever is a fixed weight, and to the opposite

end of the under one is attached the end of the connecting rod. When there is a

calm, the point of contact is at the fixed weight, and as the wind presses against

the pressure-plate it causes the rod to lift up the levers, and then the point of

contact moves along towai-ds the other end, indicating the strength of the gale, and

the levers retmn by their own weight as the pressure of the wind subsides. To the

end of the under lever a cord is attached, can-\ang a pencil to and fro along a cylinder

in the direction of its length, upon which a pencil will trace the pressm-e of the wind

for twenty-fom- hours. The velocity of the -u-ind is shown by a "gaining-clock;"

a second cord attached to the end of the imder lever is connected with the regulator

of this gaining-clock, and is so arranged that as the wind blows more or less strongly

it pulls the regulator more or less towards the fast end, and proportionally accele-
Arates the gaining of the clock.
                                  countei-poise weight brings the regulator back

as the pressure decreases. This gaining-clock also shows the true mean daily pres-

sm-e. This anemometer also registers simultaneously, and on the same paper with

the pressure, a perfect record of the directional variations.

           On the EartJiquahe and Storm in Sussex of 21st August 1864.

                             By the Eev. E. B. Ellmak.

  --In this paper attention was directed to the following facts : For the previous

three months there had been scarceh* a shower, and the wells were consequently
very low, and watercourses dried up, when, towards the end of the week ending
20th August, in certain situations springs broke up, or increased in their supply
of water (a circimistance not imcommon after a long drought, and which is always
considered a prognosticator of approaching rain, but to which public attention is
not known to have been directed). It was full moon on Wednesday the 17th,
and consequently the highest tides were on the 18th and 19th, which are said
to raise the level of the water in certain wells ; but that the tidal pressm-e was not

the only influence on this occasion to increase the supply of spring water was
evident from springs largely increasing their supply, which had never been known
to have been influenced by the tide. At last, on Saturday the 20th, there were
copious showers ; but in the evening it was fine and clear, and so continued, when,

about 1.2.5 on the Sunday morning, the inhabitants of the district for about fifteen
miles around Lewes were aroused by a shock of an earthquake, the wave pro-

ceeding from N.W. to S.E. The -violence of the shock was manifested by bottles
and even heavy stoneware being thrown down and broken, bells rimg, walls
cracked, &c. 'The time of the shock was coincident witli that of high tide on

that part of the Sussex coast, when, of course, the tidal pressure was the gi-eatest.

After the shock had passed, it was perfectly calm and clear for some hom-s ; but

about 8 or 9 a.m. a very heavy storm came fi-om the S.W., the lightning being
very vivid, and the hail coming down in such quantities as to lie on the ground

in some places more than two feet deep. Two -waterspouts were observed, which

biu-st with teiiific violence. The writer stated that these few facts led him to

conclude that changes of weather are produced, not merely by aerial and electrical

causes, but partly by subterranean causes. It was suggested that, if it were
thought sufficiently important to investigate the subject, it would be desirable to

W.--obtain the magnetic disturbances at the time at the KewObsei-vatory, which is within
fifty miles N.  the very direction from which the earthquake-wave proceeded.

The writer's views were supported by an extract from a letter by Dr. Nicholson, of

Framfield, in which, after alluding to this earthquake, he says, "I have frequently

experienced in the West Indies similar shocks after a long drought, and am inclined

to attribute some of them at least to electricity, as propounded by Dr. Stukely in
1749, when an earthquake was felt in London and other parts of England."

Diagram of the Great Storm of December 3, 1863, from the records of the self-

    registering Instruments of 'the Liverpool Observatory. Bij John Hartntjp,

     F.R.A.S., Director of the Observatory.

_ It is scarcely possible, by means of tables of figures, to convey an idea of the way

in which the diflerent meteorological instruments are aftected previous to and during
these destructive gales of wind, and I have therefore endeavoured to make the sub-
.]ect more intelligible by arranging the records under each other in a diagram. See

Plate III.

   As is not unfrequently the case, the heavy storm of the 3rd of December last was
preceded by a light gale on the 2nd, in which the fall and rise of the barometer, the
calm, and the changes in the direction of the wind were somewhat similar to those
which accompanied the heavy gale. The rapid fall of the barometer from midnight
to 6 a.m. on the 3rd, the calm between six and seven, and the sudden shift of wind

from east through south to west are all indications of the approaching storm.

   The barometer-tracing has been taken from the original record produced by
King's self-registering barometer. The strength and direction of the wind and the
rain-fall have been taken from the sheets of Osier's self-registering anemometer and
rain-gauge. The figures at the bottom of the diagram show the readings of the
thermometers as recorded during the storm. The changes of barometric pressure,
the strength and direction of the wind, and the fall of rain are shown on the dia-
gram, ft'om 9 A.M. on the 2nd to 9 a.m. on the 4th of December.

       On the Regression of Temperature during the Month of May.
                 By Professor Hennesst, F.B.S., M.B.I.A.
He referred to the various explanations ofiered with regard to this remarkable
phenomenon. Dry winds from Asia and Eastern Em-ope appear to be the direct

causes of high noctmnal radiation, as well as immediate cooling of the west of
WhyEurope during May.
                                                              these winds should produce these results in a manner

so remarkably periodical is the point requiring explanation. At this time the
isothermals of mean temperature are nearly parallel to the equator in the greater

part of oiu-  continent                                       therefore  easterly winds could  not  directly arise from dif-
                                                           ;

ferences of temperature. These winds might, however, be northeriy currents in

Asia, which the earth's rotation had gradually transformed into easterly winds
on reaching Western Europe. The Russian observatories in Siberia might furnish

facts to verify this conjecture. Another operating influence might also arise from

the diumal variations of wind-force and temperature, both of which are very

remarkable during May. If we conceive the distribution of atmospheric tem-

perature to be represented by a system of synthermal lines, showing the actual

temperature of different places at the same time, it appears from tables calculated by

the author, as well as from a graphical projection, that such lines would deviate
most from equatorial parallelism during May. The paper concluded by reference to

the frequent occurrences of warm dry summers following marked regressions of tem-

perature during the early part of May, and the remarkably cold and wet summer
of 1860 was mentioned as preceded by precisely the opposite phenomenon.

                Tlie Te^nperature and Rainfall at Bath.

                By the Rev. L. Jentns, M.A., F.L.S., F.G.8.

The author stated that no register of the weather at Bath appeared to have been

1864.                                                                                               2

kept for a sufficient length of time to determine the mean j'early temperature of the

town itself. He was enabled, however, from observations of his own, combined

with those of others, to correct a popular en-or respecting the summer temperatui-e.
Strangers often suppose that as Bath is milder than many towns in the midland,
eastern, and south-eastern counties of England in winter, it must necessarily be

hotter in suromer. Several instances were adduced in which, during periods of
very high temperatm-e in most parts of England, the conti-ary was shown to be the
case ; and he stated generally, in reference to both summer and winter, that he
found on an average a difference of 5° between extremes of heat and cold at Bath
and the extremes of heat and cold registered during the same states of weather at

those other places above alluded to. This difference increased as the seasons

became more extreme, and diminished when they were of a more moderate cha-

racter, sometimes being scarcely perceptible.

    The towns in England cooler than Bath in summer were stated to be Liverpool,
Manchester, York, and Scarborough. Those decidedly warmer than Bath in winter
were considered to be Ventnor, Torquay, and Penzance.

   If Bath, notwithstanding its lower mean summer temperature than many other

places, has anything of a relaxing character at that season, as it is often considered
to have, it was thought this might be due to its being situated at the bottom of a
 basin, surrounded nearly on all sides by high hills, which must necessarily check

 the cu'culation of the air, and render the atmosphere in the town, to a certain
extent, oppressive in sultry weather. The same hills probably have an influence in

moderating both the heat of summer and the cold of winter.

    The averao-e yearly rainfall in the town of Bath, calculated from the measiu-e-
 ments of twenty years (1842 to 1861, both inclusive) by a gentleman whose gauge
was on the top of his house, 90 feet above the sea-level, was stated to be 31-97

inches.

   The following Tables give the rain at three other stations in the neighbourhood

of Bath :--

   The first of these stations is Swanswick Cottage, about two miles north of Bath,
the measurements having been made by the Rev. F. Lockey for a period of thirty
years, 1834-1863. Gauge 32 feet above the ground, and at the estimated height of

350 feet above the river at Bath.
   The second station is Radstock, about eight miles south of Bath. Register

kept by the late rector for ten years, 1841-1850, Gauge 250 feet above the sea-

level.

   The third is Batheaston Reservoirs, about three miles north-east of Bath, where
a register was commenced by Mr. Mitchell in 1860, and is still carried on. Gauge
about 2 feet from the ground, and 226 feet above the sea. The fall of rain in this

locality for each month of the four complete years since elapsed, with the addition
of the number of days in each month on which rain fell, is given separate in the

second Table.        --Table I. Average Rainfall in inches.

the species of natural disturbances of the earth's crust. And if the same law of

increase continues up to very high temperatvires, steam would be powerful enough
to cause earthquakes and volcanos. The heat of a common fire is known to be
1141° F., dull red heat 980° (difference 161°) ; and he thought boiler explosions
were often caused by stirring the fire rapidly, and changing the latter temperatm-e

into the former, which would greatly increase the pressure.

                         On the Properties of certain Stream-lines.

            By Professor W. J. Macqxtorn Rankine, LL.D., F.R.8.

   This paper was a summary of an investigation in continuation of one of which an
abstract was read to the British Association in 1863, and which has been published
in fuU in the 'Philosophical Transactions.' The new investigation consists of

three parts. The first part relates to certain exponential stream-lines, suitable for
the "buttock-lines" of ships, and resembling the lines introduced by Mr. Scott
Russell for that purpose. It also shows that, by the action of certain pressures on
the surfaces of water, waves may travel, which begin to break when the two slopes
of their crests meet at right angles*. The second part relates to Lissoneo'ids, that
is, to those forms of stream-lines which are the fullest, consistently with not pro-
ducing unnecessary disturbance in the water: it solves the problem in three
dimensions, which in the previous paper had been solved in two. The third part
relates to stream-line surfaces of revolution. (See Phil. Mag. October 1864: and

January 1865.)

On a Mode of Determining the Velocity of Sound. By Dr. J. Stevellt.

Suppose a piece of clock-work prepared, for instance, to strike single strokes

upon a beU each time the detent is set fi-ee ; the detent to be under the control of

an electro-magnet, which is instantly set in action by an observer, at a measured
distance from the bell or other orio-in of sound, depressing a key, and thus com-

pleting a galvanic circuit. The oDserver, being furnished with a chronometer,

depresses the key ; the instant he hears the stroke of the bell he again depresses

it ; hears a second sound, and so goes on for 100 or 1000 times, carefully noting

Aby the chronometer the instant at which he hears the last sound of the series.

trained observer would not make a probable error of one-tenth of a second in

noting the whole time occupied by the whole series ; and to avoid all chance of

miscounting the number of soimds in the series, the clock may be readily made to

keep count of the number of strokes it makes. The whole time occupied by the

--entn-e series is made up of the following portions : 1st. The time consumed in the

mechanical work of the clock in producing the stroke, and of the key, from the

instant the observer touches it until it has completed the circuit. 2nd. The

personal equation of the obseiwer. 3rd. The time the soimd takes to travel 100

(or 1000) times the measm'ed distance of the origin of the soimd from the observer.

4th. The time the sound takes to travel 100 times (or 1000 times, as the case may

Nowbe) the measured distance.  the first, second, and fourth of these portions

of time can be readily eliminated by repeating the same series of observations

exactly (the clock being wound up at the commencement of each series exactly to

the same extent) ; the observer, on the second occasion, placing himself at one-

half, or one-fourth, or at any determined part of his previous distance from the

origin of sound ; or by placing himself close up to it, using the same wires for the

galvanic cu'cuit On each occasion, in order to eliminate the fourth portion. The

author was not fully aware of the exact mechanism by which Professor Piazzi

Smyth discharges the cannons which he has introduced as time-signals, but he

had no doubt it could be adapted to this method, and thus determine experi-

mentally whether the velocity of sound is affected by the violence of its origina-

--ting cause a question which Mr. Earushaw has from theory decided in the

affirmative. It would, however, involve, the author supposed, the use of two

slopes of the crest meet at right angles belongs to all waves in which " molecular rotation "

at work. This, however, either at Greenwich or Edinburgh could be readily

accomplished.

On the Cohesion-Figures of Liquids. By C. Tojilinson, F. C.S,

   This subject was introduced to the British Association at Manchester, in 1861.

The author now stated the progress which had been made since that time, and
introduced two new sets of figures. The principle of the examination by this me-

thod is to place a drop of a liquid on the surface of clean water in a chemically

clean glass, when a figure is produced which was characteristic of the liquid so
tested, and capable of being used for its identification. The figure fonned is a func-

tion of cohesion, adhesion, and difliisibility. If any one of these forces be varied,

the figure varies. The figures of alcohol, for example, on water, mercury, the fixed

Aoils, melted lard, spennaceti, paraffin, sulphur, &c., are all different.  new set of

figures is produced by allowing the drop to subside in a column of liquid instead of
diffusing over its surface. These last the author calls " submersion figures of

liquids." The figm-e of a drop of oil of lavender in a column of alcohol thus pro-

Aduced is singularly complicated and beautiful.  drop of oil of cloves or of cin-

namon in a column of castor oil also forms a remarkable submersion figure. The

test by cohesion-figures was stated by the author to be so delicate as to readily

distinguish difl[^erences between oils so closely related as the oleines of beef-fat and

mutton-fat.

Address by William Odling, M.B., F.R.S., F.R.C.P., Secretary to the Che'

        mical Society, Lecturer on Chemistry at St. Bartholomew's Hospital.

At the Leeds Meeting of the British Association in 1858, Sir John Herschel, the

then President of the Chemical Section, opened its proceedings with an introductoiy
address of singular interest, and thereby established a precedent which, with a
solitary exception, has been uniformly adopted by successive occupants of the posi-

tion which I have now the honour to hold. Following in his footsteps, Imu/o inter-

vallo, I in my turn now venture upon a few words of introduction to the proper

business that we have in hand. In the first place, I may congi'atulate the Section
upon the presence among us of so many distinguished chemists, including several

of my more immediate predecessors. I need scarcely express the personal gratifi-
cation I feel at meeting them here, nor say how much their presence relieves me

from the feeling of responsibility and self-mistrust with which I undertook the

honourable office so kindly entrusted to me by the General Committee, feeling now

that, upon any occasion of difficulty, I shall have them to apply to for counsel

and assistance.
   After the great diversity, or rather antagonism, of opinion which has existed for

the last dozen years or so,'l am almost bound to take a somewhat prominent notice
of the substantial agreement which now prevails among English chemists as to the

combining proportions of the elementary Dodies and the molecular weights of their
most important compounds. The present unanimity of opinion on this fundamental

subject among those who have given it their attention is, I conceive, greater than

has ever been the case since Dalton published his ' New System of Chemical Phi-

losophy,' more than half a centurj' ago. As yet, indeed, the unanimity of practice

falls considerably short of the unanimity of belief ; but, even in this du-ection. great
progress is being made, to which the publication of Miller's 'Elements of Che-
mistry,' Watts's ' Dictionary of Chemistry,' and Hofmann's ' Jury Report on the
Chemical Products in the Great Exhibition,' will doubtless give a yet stronger im-

petus. As was well observed by Dr. Miller at a previous Meeting of this Association,
" Chemistry is not merely a science ; it is also an art, which has introduced its
nomenclature and its notation into our manufactories, and in some measure even
33 REPORT 1864.

into our daily life." Hence the great difficulty of effecting a speedy change in
chemical usages alike so time-honoured and intimately ramified with the affairs of
our everyday existence. I propose, by your permission, to make a few remarks
upon the history of this chemical reformation, more especially in connexion with
certain points which one or two of its acknowledged leaders have scarcely, I

think, correctly estimated.

   From the time when Dalton first introduced the expression " atomic weight," up
to the year 1842, when Gerhardt annoimced his views upon the molecular con-
stitution of water, there does not appear to have been any marked difference of
opinion among chemists as to the combining proportions of the principal elements.
That 1 part by weight of hydrogen united with 36 parts by weight of chlorine to

form a single molecule of hydrochloric acid, and with 8 parts by weight of oxygen
to form a single molecvde of water, was the notion both of Berzelius and Gmelin,

who may be taken as representatives of the two chief Continental schools of theo-

retic chemistry. Indeed, no doubts seem to have been entertained in their time
as to the combining proportions of the three elements. Using the hydrogen scale
of numbers, both chemists represented the combining proportion of hydrogen as 1,
that of chlorine as 36, and that of oxygen as 8. Both, moreover, represented the
molecular weight of hydrochloric acid as 37, and the molecidar weight of water
as 9. It is true that Berzelius professedly regarded the single combining propor-
tions of hydrogen and chlorine as consisting each of two physical atoms ; but, since
the two atoms of hydrogen, for instance, which constitvited the one combining
proportion of hydrogen, were chemically inseparable from one another, they were
really tantamount to one atom only of hydrogen, and, in point of fact, were always
employed by Berzelius as representing the single chemical atom of hydrogen, or its
smallest actual combining proportion. Distinguishing thus between the physical
atom and the combiningproportion,Berzelius'srecognitiouof the truth, that equal vo-
lumes of the elementai-y gases contain an equal number of atoms, was utterly barren.
But, identifying the physical atom -with the combining proportion, Gerhardt's re-
cognition, or rather establishment, of the broader truth, that equal volumes of fill
gases, elementary and compound, contain the same number of atoms, has been in
the highest degree prolific. From Gerhardt's division of volatile bodies into a
majority whose recognized molecules corresponded respectively with four volumes
of vapour, and a minority whose recog-nized molecules corresponded respectively
with but two volumes, kud from his proposal, in conjunction with Laurent, to
double the molecular weights of these last, so as to make the molecules of all
volatile bodies, simple and compound, correspond each with four volumes of vapour,
must, I conceive, be traced the development by himself and others of the matured

views on chemical philosophy which now prevail. With evei-y respect for my

predecessor in this chair, and for the accomplished author of the ' Lemons de Philo-

sophic Chimique,' from neither of whom do I ever venture to difier without fear

and trembling, I cannot join with them in regarding the initiation of Gerhardt's

system as an imperfect retm-n, and its remarkable maturation in these recent days

 as a more complete return to the notions of Berzelius. Although, indeed, the ele-

mentary weights now employed, with the exception of those for some half-dozen

 metals,' are identical with the atomic weights of Berzelius, yet so unlike are they

 to his combining weights that fully four-fifths of all known compounds have to be

--expressed by formula entirely different from his namely, all those bodies, with

but very few exceptions, into which hydi'ogen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, ni-

 trogen, phosphorus, arsenic, boron, and the metals lithium, sodium, potassium, silver,

and gold, enter as constituents. Fully adiiiitting that the new system of atomic

--weights, as it now exists, is the joint product of many minds fully admitting

 that it owes its present general acceptance chiefly to the introduction of the water
 type by Williamson dming Gerhardt's lifetime, and the recognition of diatomic

--metals by Wurtz and Cannizzaro, after his decease and fully admitting, moreover,

 that some of Gerhardt's steps in the development of his unitary system were de-
 cidedly, though perhaps excusably, retrograde, I yet look upon him, not I trust

 with the fond admiration of the pupil, but with the calm judgment of the chemist,

 as being the gi-eat founder of that modern chemical philosophy in the general spread
 of which I have already ventured to congratulate the Members of the Section.

                                                                                         TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                            S3

Prior to the time of Gerhardt, the selection of molecular weights for difl'erent

bodies, elementary and compound, had been almost a matter of hazard. Relying

conjointly upon physical and chemical phenomena, he first established definite

principles of selection, by pointing out the considerations upon which the determina-

tion of atomic weights must logically depend. Kelying upon these principles, he

established his classification of the non-metallic elements into monhydrides, repre-

sented by chlorine                                                                       dihydrides, represented by oxygen ;                                   trihydrides, represented by
                                                                                      ;

nitrogen, &c. ; and, relying upon the same principles, but with a greatly increased

knowledge of phenomena, later chemists have given to his method a development

and imity, more especially as regards the metallic elements, which have secured
for the new system the impregnable and acknowledged position which it at present

occupies. The comparative unauuuity which prevailed before the time of Gerhardt

was the                             unanimity of                                         submission   to  authority                                       but  the  greater  unanimity which
                                                                                                                                                       ;

now prevails is the unanimity of conviction consequent upon an intermediate

period of solitary insurrection, general disturbance, and ultimate triumph.

   Bearing in mind how much the origin of the new system by Gerhardt, and ita

completion by his colleagues and disciples, are due to a correct appreciation of the
harmony subsisting between chemical and physical relations, we cannot but give

a hearty welcome to any large exposition of mixed chemico-physical phenomena

and, whether or not we agree with all his conclusions, there can be but one opinion

as to the obligation chemists are under to Professor Kopp, of Giessen, for the great

addition he has recently made to our knowledge and means of obtaining a further

--knowledge of what has hitherto been but a very limited subject namely, specific

heat.

   The agreement of chemists as to the elemental atomic weights is tantamount to
an agreement among them as to the relative quantities of the ditt'erent kinds of

matter which shall be represented by the difterent elemental symbols ; and this

brings me to the subject of chemical notation. At one time many chemists, even

of considerable eminence, believed and taught that Gerhardt's reformation had

reference mainly to notation, and not to the association and interpretation of

phenomena, and it became rather a fashion among them to declaim against

the puerilities of notational questions. That the idea is of far greater import-
ance than the mode of expressing it, is an obvious truism; nevertheless the
mode of expression has an importance of its own, as facilitating the spread of the

idea, and more especially its development and procreation. It has been well asked,

in what position woidd the science of arithmetic have been but for the substitution

of Ai'abic for Eoman numerals, the notation in which value is expressed by the

change in position for that in which it is expressed mainly by the repetition of

a few simple signs ? It is unfortunately too true that chemical notation is at pre-
sent in anything but a satisfactory state. The much-used sign of addition is, I

conceive, about the last one would deliberately select to represent the fine idea of

chemical combination, which seems allied rather, I should say, to an interpene-

tration than to a coarse apposition of atoms. The placing of symbols in con-

tiguity, or simply introducing a point between them, as indicative of a sort of

mvdtiplication or involution of the one atom into the other, is, I think, far pre-

ferable                             but  here, as                                        pointed out  by Su-  John  Herschel, we                                    violate  the  ordinary
                                 ;

algebraic understanding, which assigns very different numerical values to the ex-
XYEressions
                                         and X-|-Y respectively. I know, indeed, that one among us has

een engaged for some years past in conceiving and working out a new and strictly

philosophical system of chemical notation by means of actual formulae, instead of

mere symbols ; and I am sure that I only express the general wish of the Section
when I ask Sir Benjamin Brodie not to postpone the publication of his views for a

longer time than is absolutely necessary for their suificient elaboration. In any

case, however, the symbolic notation at present employed, with more or less mo-

dification of detail, must continue to have its peculiar uses as an instrument of

interpretation ; and hence the importance of our endeavoming to render it more

precise in meaning and consistent in its application. Many of its incongruities

belong to the very lowest order of convention ; such, for example, as the custom of

distinguishing between the representation of so-called mineral and organic com-

pounds, one particular sequence of symbols being habitually employed in repre-
24 REPORT 1804.
                                                                                                                                                 ,

senting the compounds of carbon, and an entirely different sequence of symbols in

representing the more or less analogous compounds of all other elements. Now that

organic and mineral chemistry are properly regarded as forming one continiious

whole, a conclusion to which in my opinion Kolbe's researches on sulphuretted

organic bodies have largely contributed, it is high time that such relics of the ancient
superstition that organic and mineral chemistiy were essentially different from one
another should be done away with.

    Although, duiing the past year, the direct advance of that crucial organic
chemistry, the sjmthesis of natural organic bodies, has not been striking, yet, on
the other hand, its indirect advance has, I submit, been very considerable. Several
of the artificially produced organic compounds, at first thought to be identical
with those of natural origin, have proved to be, as is well known, not identical,
but only isomeric therewith. Hence, reader pour mieiLV saiiter, chemists have
been stepping back a little to examine more intimately the constitution both of

natural organic bodies and of their artificial isomers. The sjntlietic power having
been attained of putting the bricks together in almost any desired way, it is yet
necessary, in order to construct some particular biological edifice, fii"st to learn

Wethe way in which its constituent bricks have been naturally put together.

accordingly find the study of isomerism, or, what comes to the same thing, the
study of the intimate constitution of bodies, assuming an importance never before
accorded to it. Isomerism is, in fact, the chemical problem of the day, and con-
cun-ently with its rapidly advancing solution, through the varied endeavours of
many workers, will be the advance in rational organic sjTithesis. It is curious to
note" the oscillations of opinion in reference to this subject. Twenty years ago the
molecular constitution of bodies was perceived by a special instinct, simultane-
ously with, or even prior to, the establishment of their molecular weights. Then
came an interval of scepticism, when the intimate constitution of bodies was main-

tained to be not only unknown, but unknowable. Now we have a period of tem-

perate reaction, not recognizing the desired knowledge as unattainable, but only as

difficult of attainment. And in this, as in many other instances, we find evidence
of the healthier state of mind in which, now more perhaps than ever, the first

principles of chemical philosophy are explored. Speculation, indeed, is not less

rife and scarcely less esteemed than formerlj', but is now seldom or never mis-

--taken for ascertained truth. Scjpticism, indeed, still prevails not, however, the

sterile scepticism of resignation, but the fertile scepticism which aspires to greater
and greater certainty of knowkdje. Chemical science is advancing, I believe, not
only more rapidlj^, but upon a surer basis than heretofore ; and, while with every
advance the prospect widens before our eyes, so that we become almost alarmed

at contemplating what those who come after us will have to learn, we console

ourselves with the determination that their labour of unlearning shall be as little

--as possible far less, we hope, than what we in om* time have had to experience.

   The ice-caves to which the author referred were found in limestone rocks in
various parts of France and Switzerland. The ice was found at depths of from 50
to 200 feet below the surface, and at altitudes varying from imder 2000 to nearly
GOOO feet above the sea, and appeared in the form of columns with spreading bases
fonned by the freezing of water which dropped fi-om the roof ; of ice cascades,
supported by the sloping walls, and formed by water running into the cave from
lateral fissm-es, and in other forms, which he illustrated by drawings. In visiting
these caves he was struck by the columnar appearance presented by the fractured
side of the ice ; and, on examining it, he found that the whole mass was composed

of a vast number of prisms closely compacted. He sepai-ated the prisms at the

edge with the"greatest ease, and thrust them out one after the other, as one might
thrust out a knot of wood from the edge of a board. The prisms reminded him of
the construction of a stone wall built without mortar in a slaty country. To com-
plete the resemblance, the irregular stones Should form a compact mass, and the
surface of the wall should be ground smooth. This ice he always found to

resist the eifect of heat more successfully than ordinary ice. He observed that

the axes of aU the prisms, in the vertical colmnns of which he had spoken, lay

horizontally.

           On a New Method of extracting Gold from Auriferous Ores,
                     By F. Crace-Calvert, F.E.S., F.C.S.

At the present time, when the auriferous ores of Great Britain are attracting

public attention, it may be advantageous to persons interested in gold-mining to
Be made acquainted with a new and simple method of extracting gold from such

ores, which presents the advantages of not only dispensing with the costly use of

mercm-y, but of also extracting the silver and copper which the ore may "contain.

Further, it may be stated that the process can be profitably adopted in cases where

the amount of gold is small, and the expense of mercury consequently too great.

I need not enter here into all the details of the nimierous (about one hundred)

experiments which I made some years since, before I finally arrived at the new

method of extracting gold, which I have now the honour of communicating. I there-

--fore propose the following plan for extracting the gold on a commercial scale : The

finely reduced aiu'iferous quartz should be intimately mixed with about one per

cent,  of  peroxide of manganese                                                                                                             and if  common salt be used, this material should
                                                                                                                                          ;

be added at the same time as the manganese, in the proportion of three parts of salt

to two of manganese. The whole should be then introduced into closed vats,

having false bottoms, upon which is laid a quantity of small branches covered with

straw, so as to prevent the reduced quartz from filling the holes in the false bottom.

Muriatic acid should then he added if manganese alone is used, and diluted sul-

phuric acid if manganese and salt have been employed, and, after having left the

whole in contact for twelve hom-s, water should be added so as to fill up the whole

space between the false and true bottoms with fluid, This fluid should then be pumped

up and allowed to percolate through the mass, and after this has been done several

times, the fluid should be run oil into separate vats for extracting the gold and

copper that it may contain. To effect this, old iron is placed in it to precipitate

the copper ; and after this has been removed, the liquor is heated to drive away

the excess of free chloiine, and a concentrated solution of sulphate of protoxide of

iron, or green copperas, must be added, which, acting on the gold-solution, wiU

precipitate the gold in a metallic form. By this method both gold and copper are

obtained in a marketable condition. If silver is present in the ore, a slight modifi-

cation in the process will enable the operator to obtain this metal also. It is simply

necessaiy to generate the chlorine of the vitriol, manganese, and chloride of sodium

process, taking care to use an excess of salt, tliat is, six parts instead of three, as

above directed. The purpose of this chloride of sodium being to hold in solution

any chloride of silver that may have been formed by the action of chlorine on the

--silver ore, and to extract the metal, the following alteration in the mode of precipi-

tation is necessaiy : Blades of copper must be placed in the metallic solutions, to

throw down the silver in a metallic form, then blades of iron to throw down the

copper, the gold being then extracted as previously directed. I think the advan-

tages of this process are, 1st, cheapness; 2nd, absence of injury to the health of the

persons employed ; 3rd, that not only is the metallic gold in the ore extracted (ai?

IS done by mercury), but it attacks and dissolves all gold which may be present in

a combined state, besides enabling the miner also to extract what silver and copper

--the ore may contain. I cannot, however, conclude without reminding you of what

is generally underrated that is, the heavy expenses which attend the bringing of

the ore to the surface of the gi-ound, and crushing and preparing it for being acted
upon either by mercury or by any other agents.

On the Thermal Waters of Bath.

By Dr. Datibext, F.B.S., Professor of Botany, Oxford.

After alluding veiy briefly to the mineral constitution of the Bath waters as

affording no adequate explanation of the medicinal vii'tues ascribed to them, the

author proceeded to one point of scientific interest connected with theii' appear-

--ance namely, the large volume of gas which they have gone on constantly dis-

engaging, apparently from time immemorial. The natm'e and amount of this
were made the subject of the author's examination, in the year 1832, dui-ing an
entii-e month ; and the result amved at was that the gas consisted mainly of

nitrogen, which is present, indeed, in most other thermal waters, but in none so

copiously as at Bath. Judging from the circumstance that the majority of these

springs are associated with volcanos, and likewise that the same gas is freely

evolved fi-om the latter both in an active and in a more dormant condition, we
may faiiiy infer that the evolution of nitrogen at Bath is in some manner or other

connected with the same widely-spreading and deep-seated cause. And, if this be

the case, the phenomenon in question acquires an additional interest, as afibrding

a possible clue to the true nature of the processes which give rise to volcanos as

Nowwell as to thermal springs.  this evolution of niti-ogen seems best to admit

of explanation by supposing a process of combustion to be going on in the interior of

the globe, by which oxygen may be abstracted from the common air which pene-
trates to these depths, whilst the residuary nitrogen is evolved. What may be

the nature of the bodies by which this process of combustion is maintained must,

from the depth at which the latter is earned on, be ever shrouded in mystery ; but

it is at least certain that, whilst they cannot belong to the category of those

which supply fuel for the ordinary processes of combustion of which we are our-

selves eye-witnesses, there is nothing in the natme of the products resulting from

volcanic action inconsistent with the idea that metals possessing a strong affinity

for oxygen, but not already combined with it, might, if they existed in the interior

of the earth, be instrumental in producing the supposed combustion. And, if we
indulge in speculation, it may be maintained, with some show of probabilitj', that

the basis of the earths and alkalies which constitute the present crust of the globe
would have existed originally uncombined with oxygen, and therefore must at
one time have been subjected to that very process of oxidation and combustion

which we imagine to be at the present time continued. The author therefore
suggested that volcanic action may be owing to certain chemical reactions pro-

ceeding in the interior of the globe between the constituents of air and water, on
the one hand, and the metallic bases of the earths and alkalies on the other.

After developing this theory, the paper concluded with pointing out a practical
use to which the waste waters of the thei-mal springs of Bath might be applied

after they had fed the several baths, suggesting that, if, instead of being at once
discharged into the river, they were first conveyed through undergToimd pipes a
few feet beneath the surface within a given area, the warmth imparted to the soil

would prove highly favourable to the culture of tender exotics, and that, if the
ground were further protected from cold by a glass roof, a winter garden might be

obtained with scarcely any fm-ther expense beyond that of the original outlay.

   On a Specimen of Tin-ore hitherto urulescribed. By Fredeeick Field.

   The author, some years since, piu'chased a specimen of what was called on the
label "Slime Tin." In a matrix of quartz and fiuor are disseminated streaks of
cassiterite, and in immediate connexion with these are found similar streaks of an
earthy-loolring matter of a yeUowish-brown colour. This matter is rather soft,
and can be easily cut with a knife. Whilst an-anging the mineralogical collection

--of the Bath Literaiy and Scientific Institution, he met with two specimens thus

labelled : "Tin Ore, new variety, Cornwall." The first of these (the gift of Mr.
Fox) is a mass of a duU earthy appearance, yellowish brown in colour, and so hard
in many places as to be with difficulty scratched with a file. Its specific gravity
is 4-4. On examining with a lens, there are to be found, in some parts, specks of
cassiterite and portions of what appears to be felspar. The second specimen (the

gift of Colonel Page) is darker in colour than the first, but of equal hardness. Its
specific gravity, however, is only 3'6, and from it the author could obtain no indi-

cations of tin. With regard to these specimens, the author thinks that the slime
tin is a variety of what is called " toad's-eye wood-tin," and Mr. Fox's specimen
is this form of cassiterite mixed with much earthy matter. As for the specimen of

Colonel Page, it has no claim whatever to be called an ore of tin.

     On the Artificial Production of Anhydrite. By Alphonse Gages.

   The circumstances imder which natural anhydrite is formed have not yet been
well determined. The experiments already made, and bearing upon the various

properties of sulphate of lime, and its behavioiu at various temperatures, although

presenting gi-eat interest, have not yet given crystfiUized anhydrite under the same

conditions as it occurs in the saliferous formations. Gay-Lussac had already observed
that overheated gypsum partially lost its well-known properties, and he attributed

the cause of it to the partial formation of anhydrite. The experiments of Graham
proved, also, that gjpsum passes into a kind of amorphous anhydrite at a tempera-

ture of 204° C. At the Meeting of the British Association in Dublin, Dr. Sullivan

gave an account of some experiments by which he obtained anhydrous sulphate of

lime from its solution in water, at a temperature of about 300° C.

  A mixture of gypsum and common salt fused in a crucible, and treated by water,

leaves undissolved prismatic lamellar crystals of anhydrite. Left for manj^ days in

water, the quantity of moisture absorbed did not exceed that which some varieties

of natural anhydiite would have absorbed if placed under the same circumstances.

I give here the results obtained :

Gypsum melted with anhydrous sulphate of soda gives also crystals of anhydrite

ever, perfectly anhydi-ous. Analysis gave the following, namely :

    Mitscherlich fused gj'psum at the highest temperature of the porcelain furnace,

and obtained a white crystalline mass of anhydrite. The occuiTence of anhydrite
amongst rocks of an undoubted sedimentary origin, and the necessity of a tempera-
tm-e higher than melted lava, have been the gTeat argument employed to prove the
impossibility of anhydrite having been formed by fusion. If we could consider
melted chloride of sodium as the solvent in which anhj'drite has been produced,
the problem would be solved at once, as gypsum dissolves and ciystallizes in com-

mon salt at a temperature far below melted lava, and not rising above a dull red

--heat a temperature to which local circumstances may give rise ; at such tempera-

tui'e the liqiud mass would possess a great fluidity.

28 REPORT-- 1864.

Account of the Mode adopted at the Bradford-on-Avon Union for the

                     Utilization of Sewage. By W. Gee.

The author stated that by the daily admixture of common eai-th, the excreta, liquid

as well as solid, of forty-five children in the two schools at the workhouse had been

wholly saved, with decency and without any offence, the operation being cleanly
Aand the deodorization rapid and complete.
                                            remarkable featm-e in this method

(first published by the Hev. H. Moide of Dorchester) is the fact that the earth,

when raked out from receptacles which at Bradford are completely above the level

of the yards, may, if kept under cover till tolerably dry, be used over and oyer again

nor are paper fragments found to be troublesome, as they rot and become impercep-

tible. The result of this discovery is that ail incredibly small quantity of earth is

sufiicient for a large household ; tliree tons weight of earth (diy) used several times
Aover ha\Ting been the whole product of the schools in fifteen months.
                                                                        sample

produced was quite free from smell, and looked like mere earth in small nodides

which crumbled on slight pressure into a very fine dust, fit for the tumip-drill or

for mixing with water, like guano.
   The author strongly m-ged Mr. Moule's plan upon general notice through the me-

dium of the Association as a mean.s, hitherto slighted, of meeting the great sewage

difiiculty in every dwelling in the kingdom not forming part of a close street

although the plan is not impracticable even in streets : it would be very superior

--to the cesspools in common use forty years ago, and would in fact restore the

drains of towns to their legitimate purpose the discharge of rain- and sink-water.

On the Rate of Chemical Change. By A. Veenon Haecottet, M.A.

Two years ago, at the Cambridge Meeting of the Association, the author com-

municated to this Section a paper on certain cases of induced chemical action. In

following up the course of experiments upon which he had then entered, he became

engaged in the study of various chemical changes which take place more or less

slowly, and has thus been led into an inquiry as to the rate at which those changes
proceed. The principal case of induced oxidation, before described, was that which

occurs when permanganate of potassimn is added to a solution containing chloride

of tin and oxygen. Under these circumstances, while a portion of the tin salt is

Aoxidized by the permanganate, another portion is attacked by the free oxygen.

large number of similar cases have since been investigated by Kessler. The author's

principal object was to determine what ratio existed between the two oxidations,

and in scrutinizing the conditions of the experiment it occun-ed to him to tiy whe-

ther the sulphate of mang-anese, formed by the reduction of the i»rmanganate in

the acid solution, had any influence. He found, greatly to his surprise, that this

fixed neutral salt has itself the power of determining the transference of oxygen.

Sulphurous acid, as is well known, when mixed with a large bulk of water which

has been exposed to the air, is but slowly oxidized, and this change proceeds still

more slowly when the solution is fi-eelj' acidified. But if to such a solution a

minute quantity of sulphate of manganese is added, the oxidation of the sulphurous

acid is at once determined. It is like, so far as the residt is concerned, the effect of

adding a drop of sulphuric acid to a mixture of chlorate of potassium and sugar.

Sulphate of manganese has also the power of determining the action of various

oxidizing agents, as well as that of free oxygen. Professor Kessler observes that

the cause of a phenomenon Imown to all chemists who have tried a cliameleon

--solution with oxalic acid namely, that the colour of the portion of solution first

--added disappears very slowly, but that of succeeding portions more rapidlj is that

the sulphate of manganese, formed by the reduction of the first portion, hastens

the subsequent action. Chromic acid has apparently no action upon oxalic acid in

a cold dilute solution. The addition to this mixture of pure suljjhate of manganese

determines, under proper conditions, an immediate reduction ot the chromic acid.

How the sulphate of manganese acts in these cases is, at present, matter for con-
Wejecture.
            may compare the action of this salt in determining the union of

sulphurous acid and oxygen with that of nitric oxide. Perhaps in this case, as in

that, an alternate oxidation and reduction takes place. If we suppose that water

can act to a small extent upon a manganese salt as it acts upon a bismuth salt,

separate, that is, the base from the acid, then the hydrate of manganese thus dis-

probable that this action of the manganese salt is in some way related to the fact

that the protohydrate of this metal has the property of absorbing oxygen from

water, and parting with this oxygen to sulphurous acid. Similarly this proto-

hydrate is readily oxidized by chromic or permanganic acid, and the resulting bin-

oxide is readily reduced by oxalic acid.

Of these actions the author has selected for study that of permanganic upon

oxalic acid.

   AVhen the four following substances, permanganate of potassium, sulphuric acid,

moxalic acid, and sulphate of manganese, are brought together aqueous solution,

a chemical change takes place, resulting in the formation of sulphate of potassium,

sulphate of manganese, carbonic acid, and water. The amount of change depends

upon the amount of each of the first-named four substances, upon the dilution and

temperatm-e of the solution, and upon the time during which the substances are left

in contact. As far as can be observed, these are all the conditions which affect the

amount of chemical change in this case ; it is not affected by light, nor by the agita-

tion of the solution. The amount of change is greater, within certain limits, in

proportion as the quantities of permanganate of potassium, sulphuric acid, and

sulphate of manganese are greater, and the quantity of water less ; in proportion

also as the temperature is higher, and the time of mutual contact longer. It is

gTeater, the larger the quantity of oxalic acid, up to that point at which the oxalic

and pemiangauic acids are present in the proportions in which they act one upon

the other ; after that point, an increase in the quantity of oxalic acid diminishes

the amount of chemical change. The author has made many series of experi-

ments, in each of which all of these conditions, except one, were kept invariable,

and that one was varied according to a regular progression. He hoped thus

to determine what function of each of these variable quantities the chemical

change is, and so to obtain a true expression of the reaction. He made, for ex-

ample, a series of experiments, in all of which he took the same quantities of per-

manganic acid, oxalic acid, sulphate of manganese, and water, maintaining always

a temperatm'e of 16° C, and allowing each experiment to proceed for exactly five

minutes ; but in the second experiment he took twice the quantity of sulphuric

acid used in the first, thrice the quantity in the third, four times the quantity in

the fourth, and so on. When five minutes from the moment of mixing had expired,

the action was stopped, and the amount of permanganate still remaining deter-

Amined.       series of nimibers was thus obtained, presenting a regidar decrease,

which should bear an ascertainable relation to the corresponding quantities of sul-

phuric acid, taken in arithmetical progression. This relation, however, the author

has not yet succeeded in detennining ; but in this, as in other series, the numbers

exhibit the most perfect regularity. This is best seen by representing the results

graphically. Along the axis of x is mea-

sured that quantity, which is varied in

each successive experiment; along that of

y the quantity of changing substance which
remains still unchanged at the close of the

experiment. This quantity, it will be seen,

varies rapidly at first, the difterences be-

coming le.ss and less as the total quantity of ,,
residual substance diminishes. The series

of experiments which appeared most inter-

esting was that in which, all other condi-

tions being kept constant, the time during

which the experiment lasted was varied.

Such a series jdelds a cmwe similar to that                        0123456
which represents the effect of varying the

amount ot sulphuric acid. The curve above                                        ^

serves, therefore, as a general representation

of such a series. It may be regarded in this case as exhibiting the course of a

single experiment, showing exactly how much of the substance measured remains
after the lapse of any interval. The numbers, 1, 2, 3, &c., here represent the num-

ber of minutes during which the con-esponding experiment was allowed to procee 1.

--The mode of conducting an experiment was briefly as follows : The solution con-

taining all the substances except the permanganate was brought to the requu'ed

temperature, and the permanganate added from a pipette exactly at the beat of a

seconds' pendulum. When the time had expired, the temperatm-e of the solution

having been kept rigidly constant throughout, a solution of iodide of potassium
was added again at the beat of the clock. During and after both additions the

liquid was strongly agitated to secure rapid and perfect mixture. The addition of
iodide of potassium stops the action. The remaining permanganate is at once re-
duced, and liberates thereby an equivalent of iodine which can be detennined at
leisure in the usual way. Of such series of experiments the author has made a great

number. In the first instance he took the exact quantities of the different substances

which react one with another, according to these equations :

(I.) K,Mn,0, + 3MnSo,+2H,0 = 2H,SO,+K,SO,+ 5Mn02;
(2.) 5Mn02+5H, 80^4- lOH, C^ 0^=15H, O + SMnSO^+SOCOa

t. e., K, Mn, 0, ; 3MnS0, ; 3H, SO, ; lOH, C, 0,, 2H' 0.

But he was led to abandon atomic quantities principally by two considerations

first, any error in the proportion of the substances becomes magnified as the expe-

riment proceeds ; secondly, the solution changes, not in one particular only, but in

several. The quantities of sulphuric acid, oxalic acid, and permanganate diminish,

the quantitv of sulphate of manganese increases, while that of the water alone re-

mains sensilily constant. In later experiments he had taken all the other substances

in such excess, as compared with the permanganate, as to be practically, like the

water, infinite in relation to it. Of all, he has taken 100 times the atomic propor-

tion, so that the total change taking place in the solution from end to end of the

reaction would be a diminution in the amoimt of oxalic acid and sulphuric acid

from 100 to 90 pai-ts, and an increase of 1 per cent, in the amoimt of sulphate of

manganese. He found by an experiment in which the quantities at starting were

varied 1 per cent., that such an alteration did not perceptibly affect the residt.

Under these conditions, then, one chemical substance gradually disappears, all aroimd
Ait remaining unchanged.
                          known quantity is introduced into the solution, which

has from the first, where the oxalic acid and sulphate of manganese are in large

excess, not a red, but a deep brown colour ; the siibstance thus formed, and whose

gradual disappearance we desire to trace, is in all probability binoxide of manga-

nese. Having made a number of determiuations after the lapse of various times, we
can follow exactly the com'se of its diminution. At first the colour changes rapidly,

but as it becomes paler it fades more and more slowly. The axis of x is, no doubt,

an asymptote of the curve ; theoretically the whole would never disappear. The

--problem, then, to be determined was to find the relation between these two series

of numbers or, in other words, given this curve to find its equation. Both in it and

in many of the experiments already described, the author enjoyed the cooperation of

Mr. Esson, Fellow of Mertou College, Oxford. The result at which the author and

Mr. Esson believe themselves to have arrived is, that the mmibers representing the

quantities remaining after equal intervals of time are in geometrical progression, and

the curve consequently a logarithmic curve. This result admits of a simple and in-

teresting interpretation. It is precisely that which would follow fi-om the hypothesis

that the dissolved binoxide exists in the fluid in the form of minute spheres upon

whose unit of surface is performed a constant action. The total action thus at any

moment varies with the surface exposed, and diminishes continually as the spheres,

shell after shell, melt away. But the result may ])e explained without the introduc-

tion of an hypothesis, if we suppose the binoxide of manganese to be replaced as it

disappears, so that the quantity present is always the same, chemical change wUl

proceed, since no condition alters, at a imifomi rate, a certain fraction of the whole

amount disappearing in a unit of time. But since the relation between the binoxide

and the solution in which it is, is not affected by a change in the quantity of the

former, one of these magnitudes being infinite relatively to the other, this fraction

will remain always constant when the binoxide is not replaced, but is allowed to

diminish ; that is to say, the amount which changes during a moment of time is
directly proportional to the total amount existing in solution at that time ; or, if

-- --we regard the binoxide as doing work oxidizing oxalic acid then the statement

is that the amount of work done is du'ectly proportional to the amoimt of substance
which at any time is there to do it. It will be of interest to examine by similar

methods other cases of chemical change in solutions. If it is foimd, as appears

--highly probable, that wherever the rate of change is measurable, wherever, that

is, it proceeds slowly, and can be started and terminated at a given moment, and

--the amount changed or remaining unchanged determined, it follows the same law,

then we may pass inductively to a generalization covering those cases of chemical

change which take place with an immeasurable velocity, or which cannot be aiTested

at will, or for the determination of whose residues or products no exact methods are

known just as by the use of the pendulum or of Attwood's machine we may prove

On a New Method of detecting Arsenic, Antimony, Sulphur, and Phosphorus,
  hy their Hydroqen Compounds, ivJien in mixed Gases. By Dr. W. Bibd

Herapath, M.i)., F.B.S. L. <Sf E., F.C.S., ^c. Sfc.

Having to investigate a case of suspected poisoning by phosphorus, in which

the traces of free phosphorus had disappeared during the long interval between

administration of the poison and analysis, Dr. Herapath examined for phosphorous

acid by Scherer's method ; but as several of the hydrogen compounds of sulphur
and arsenic, for instance, have the property of blackening the salt of silver, he

eliminated these hydrogen compounds from the gas before its absorption by

ammoniacal nitrate of silver, or tested the gas, as it was being evolved, for any of

these compounds. He dissolved in dilute hot hydrochloric acid the organic matter,

stomach, intestines, and contents ; the room of operation being at the time quite

dark ; and to the flask an apparatus was fixed for exhibiting any phosphoric flashes

of light, as in Mitscherlich s experiment : no flashes appeared. The acid solution

might, however, have contained arsenic, phosphorus as phosphorous acid, antimony

as chloride, and sulphur as tam'ine, &c. No chlorate of potassa could be employed

in oxidizing the organic matter, or phosphorous acid would become phosphoric,

and all evidence be lost, for sulphates and phosphates are not reducible in the

hydrogen apparatus. To the liquid filtered there was added one-third of spirit of

Awine, and it was then ready for use.  gas evolution bottle, with funnel and

pipe, armed with a tube containing chloride of calcium and chalk in coarse

powder, for the preparation of pure hydrogen gas, was arranged and tested, as
usual, for arsenic. To the exit-pipe was attached a green glass tube, well sup-
ported, passing over two or more spiiit-lamp flames. The exit-pipe was bent at

right angles, to go through a wide-mouthed bottle, containing slips of white

filtering-paper, dipped in a solution of nitroprusside of sodiimi, made alkaline by
ammonia, ti-om which the gas was carried to the next bottle, containing ammo-

niacal nitrate of silver ; and there was another exit-pipe leading to a bottle of some
salt of lead, or armed with a jet for burning. The apparatus being at this period

ready for use, pure zinc, sulphuric acid, and distilled water were placed in the hydro-

gen evolution bottle, and the stream of gas having been allowed to escape through

the apparatus, to expel atmospheric air, heat was applied to the tubes with spirit-
lamps. Now, if arsenic had been present it should have produced a crust in the usual

place ; and antimony would, if present, have been deposited at a spot near it ; whilst
sulphur would partly have been sublimed and deposited in front of the arsenic, and

the remaining undecomposed sulphuretted hydi-ogen gas have communicated a

deep purple-blue tint to the paper charged with the ammoniacal nitroprusside of
sodium ; whilst the phosphoretted hydrogen, passing unchanged through aU these

tests, would have been at once seized by the ammoniacal nitrate of silver and

have produced the black phosphide of silver, and the free hydrogen have escaped

through the lead solution without changing its colour, unless the evolution (sup-

posing phosphorus to be present) of phosphoretted hydi-ogen should have been too

violent for the perfect reaction of the silver salt. It was now possible to examine

the prepared organic liquid with tliis apparatus: by inserting it in quantities of
only a few drachms at a time into the hydrogen bottle, through the tubulated
funnel, and by employing sufficient spirit, no frothing could occur to endanger the

success of the experiment ; but it might at any moment be checked by the addition
of a little spirit down the funnel. If the tubes showed no deposit, and the paper
remained white, neither arsenic, antimony, nor sulphur could be present. The
black precipitate in the silver bottle would inferentially have been phosphide of
silver, but it admitted of absolute proof by testing with Scherer's process. The
operation being completed, the silver salt was passed through a filter previously
washed with acetic or nitric acid, and aftei-wards with ammonia, and the collected

black precipitate submitted to proof by burning the filter-paper. Acting on the
ashes with nitric acid and heat until oxidized, the silver precipitated by pure
hydrochloric acid, and the solution filtered, it contained all the phosphorus as
phosphoric acid, which could be tested by the nitrate of magnesia or the chloride
with ammonia, the characteristic crystals of triple phosphate of ammonia and mag-
nesia examined in the microscope and identified by the action of polarized light,
and the measurement of their angles in the goniometer, or by a solution of nitrate

of silver added -ttath ammonia, when the yellow phosphate of silver would be

obtained, and the blue phosphate of iron, with a solution of its protosalt.

On the Premature Decay of the Frescoes in the Houses of Parliament, its Cause
                      and Remedy. By "William Poole King.

   The decay of frescoes first shows itself as a bloom, rendering the whole sm-face
dull and clouded ; soon after raised blotches appear, which become white and after-
wards drop ofl' in a dry powder, carrying off the colom- in patches from the fresco.
If walls built with mortar made from limestone of marine origin be examined in
cold weather, the pointing of the wall will be foimd to be covered with a bloom
which in places is lengthened out into needle-formed crystals, varying from -f^th
of an inch to 2 inches long. These crystals in warm weather change into a white
powder, and di-op otf, carrying much of the pointing of the wall with them. These
crystals, when examined chemically, are found to consist, for the most part, of sul-
phate of soda, sometimes, though rarely, mixed with nitrate of potash and nitrate
of lime, with small quantities of mm-iate of lime and magnesia. The droppings
from frescoes are composed of nearly the same materials, and are brought down by
the efilorescence of the sidphate of soda. To preserve frescoes, the sulphate of soda
in the wall should be kept in a dormant state by being always dry and warm.

                   By Dr. Stevenson MAc.iDAM, F.R.S.E., F.C.S.

   The author recently undertook a lengthened series of experimental observations
on the pollution of rivers by the sewage of towns, with special reference to the
contamination of the Water of Leith by the sewage of Edinburgh and Leith. The
principal points brought out in the com-se of the investigation were

   I. The chemical nature and condition of the Water of Leith as it arrives at
Edinburgh, and before being contaminated bv the sewage from the dwellings of
100,000 of the inhabitants of Edinburgh and Leith.

   II. The chemical composition of the liquids conveyed by the main sewers of
Edinburgh and Leith into the Water of Leith, by day and by night, during five
weeks in spring and ten days in summer.

   III. The analyses of the sedimentary matters found, in the open sewers draining
into the Water of Leith.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  33

   IV. The chemical condition of the Water of Leith, and the lakes connected there-

witli, as thoy recei^-e successive quantities of sewage from 180 drains and sewers
which discharge their contents into the stream at intervals from Coltbridge, west

of Edinburgh, down to the harbour of Leith.

   y. The analyses of the deposits of organic matter which are found in large

quantities in the bed of the Water of Leith after the entrance of the sewage, and

especially in rocky pools and above the dams ; as also of the sediment in the Lades
and in the harbour of Leith.

   VI. The chemical nature of the gases evolved in large quantities from the putre-
fying sedimentary deposits in the Lades and Water of Leith, including the harbour.

   VII. The natm-e and proportion of the gases dissolved in the waters of the river

above and below the influence of the sewage. And

   VIII. The degree of impurity in the atmosphere in the immediate neighbourhood
of the Water of Leith conveying sewage, and including the open sewers, the Lades,
and the harbour of Leith ; and contrasting the air under the influence of the foul
sewage and Water of Leith with the air in the centre of Edinbm-gh and Leith, and
away from the immediate influence of sewage.

   The author stated that the special part of the inquiry to which he wished to direct
the attention of the Section was the proportion and nature of the gases dissolved in

the waters which were contaminated mth sewage, as contrasted with those which

were uucontaminated by sewage. This department of the inquiry, in relation to the

contiunination of rivers by the sewage of towns, had not received that amount of
attention which it apparently deserves. The presence of oxygen gas dissolved in

natural waters aids in the decomposition of any organic matters which may pass

thereinto, and all healthy waters contain an amount of oxygen dissolved therein
which is equivalent to abont 29 per cent, of the entu-e volume of the gases in solution.

   The following Table gives the proportions of the gases present in one imperial

water supplied to Edinburgh and Leith. of the liquids conveyed by the sewers,
and of the Water of Leith after receiving sewage, and including the Lades and

harbour of Leith. It may be stated that the analyses marked * were made on a

day in spiing, and the remainder were made on a day in summer.
From the above Table it will be observed that the spring water supplied to
Edinburgh, as also the waters which form the sources of the Water of Leith,

contain  about 29  per cent, of  oxvgen iu  the  gases  dissolved therein                                                                                and  as  the

Water of Leith passes several paper-mills and arrives at Coltbridge, where it meets

the sewage of Edinburgh, the amount of oxygen is fully 22 per cent, of the gases.
The gases dissolved in the liquids conveyed by the sewers contain only from 2-10
to 3-3.3 per cent, of oxygen ; and when the sewage has mingled with the Water of

Leith, the percentage of oxygen in the main stream falls to 10-20 and even to 4-10,

and in the Lade to 5-40 and even 4-76.

  mThese experimental facts demonstrate that the amount of oxygen dissolved

the water of^the Water of Leith, after receiving the sewage of Edinburgh, is reduced
to a minimum, and is practically of little use in consuming the large amoimt of
organic matter in solution and suspension iu the water; and moreover shows that,

even were the more foul impurities to be separated from sewage and streams
conveying sewage, the liquid, though it might be clear, would not contain that

amount of oxygen gas dissolved therein which would admit of fishes living in it,
and finding tlie air required for their respiration. Trials have been made by the
author with water obtained ft'om irrigatiug meadows, and -ndth the water of the

Water of Leith, after separation of the gross impurities by mechanical filtering-beds
of sand and clay, and the water in either case did not possess the power of supporting
the life of fish ; and, indeed, when the fish were introduced therein, they quickly

died.

              A Suggestion on the Detection of Poisons by Dialysis.

        By Dr. A. T. Machattie, F.C.S., Lecturer on Chemistry, Glasgow.

    The author suggested that in some cases it might be of advantage to employ
 the coats of the stomach or intestines of an animal as the membrane or septum of
 the dialyzer, and in this way avoid interference with the organs themselves. This
 can the more readily be done, since the exterior of the stomach of animals is
 seldom coated with any appreciable amount of fatty matter, and therefore the
 whole preparation necessary seems to consist in thoroughly washing the exterior
 of the stomach or intestines to be examined ; for thereafter the organ may be at
  once exposed to the external action of pure water, as in the commonly pursued
  methods of dialysis. This manner of detecting poison need not entirely prevent

  the previous examination of the interior lining of the stomach, provided that the

  opening be made so as to enable the stomach to be afterwards suspended in water
  without mechanical leakage. The intestines of an animal supposed to be poisoned

  scarcely require to be opened throughout their entire length, and accordingly a

  portion of them left imtouched maybe tied firmly at each end, washed carefully, and

  exposed to the external action of water for twenty-four hom-s, or longer if necessary,
  in the usual way. Into a portion of the duodenimi of a sheep, one-half of a grain
  of arsenious aci"d was placed, dissolved and suspended in water. This part of the

  duodenum, after being washed, was tied at each end and suspended in eight

  oimces of water, in such a manner as to keep tlie tied ends entirely out of the
  water, and so prevent the contents from escaping by any opening that might stiU
  exist. The liquid, after twenty-four hom-s, yielded arsenic by Eeinsch's process ; but
  no appreciable precipitate was obtained by treating the liquids with hydrochloric and
  hydrosulphuric acids. The author described a similar experiment which he had

· made with strychnine.

of metallic nickel ; and as I am not aware that nickel is a commonly occurring

impurity in lead, or, indeed, tliat if has been found in commercial lead before, I take

this opportunity of recording the residts of the analysis which was made by me of

the sample referred to.

   The composition of the sample analyzed was as follows :

   It will be obsei-yed that the above is a highly impure specimen of lead ; for, besides
the nickel which gives to it its present interest, the sample contains nearly 11 per
cent, of antimon3^ The physical properties of the lead were such as to show, even

previous to the analysis, that the sample was verj' impure. When attempting to

divide a portion with an iron chisel, the piece broke with a highly ci-ystalline frac-
ture, and was not cut or beateu out by hammering like ordinary lead. The brittle-

ness of the alloy is, no doubt, much more due to the antimony than to the nickel,
but the latter probably assists in communicating this property to the metal. The

specific gravity of this lead is 9-95, while that of pure lead is 11-4. Again, as nickel
has a specific gravity of 8-8, and antimony of 6-8, the low density of the alloy is

easily accounted for.

   The source of the ore from which the metal was obtained I could not discover,
further than that the lead is of German manufacture, which so far explains the pre-
sence of such a large proportion of nickel. The lead can scarcely be used for the
ordinary applications of that metal ; but the large percentage of antimony would
probably recommend it in the mannfactm-e of type-metal.

Ohemical E.ramiwtt'wn of a Hot Sprinij in Wheal CJiffonl, Cornwall.

              By Professor W. A. Miller, M.B., Treas. U.S.

   In the course of conversation with Sir C. Lyell a few months ago, he men-
tioned to me the occurrence of a remarkably powerful hot spring, at a gi-eat depth,
in one of the Cornish mines, no detailed examination of which liad hithei-to been
made. The interest of such an examination was obvious, and it was arranged that
a supply of the water should be forwarded to me for analysis.

   "\yheal Cliflbrd is a copper mine near Itedruth in Cornwall. The lode, con-

     _

sistingof a porous pjTites, runs east and west, and the spring comes out in a fissure
at the junction of the el van or granitic poi-phyry with the killas or clay-slate ; the
mass of the lode, however, exists in the clay-slate itself. Mr. H. Davey, by whose
kindness the water was obtained, estimated the flow of the spriug roughly at
about 150 gallons per minute. It occurs in the 2;30-fathom level, at a depth of
about 220 fathoms, of 1320 feet below the sea. The water comes out at a tempera-
ture of 125° F., the temperature of the air in that part of the mine being 110- at

the time that the water was collected. The water is nearly clear, but becomes
turbid on standing, and deposits a scanty ochreous sediment. It has a strong
saline taste, and when boiled does not give any fm". The gaseous components
were the following at 60° F., and 30 inches bar. :

The quantity of csesium I have not yet had leisure to ascertain, but the amoimt
must be relatively rather considerable, as the precipitate of the double chloride of

platimmi and potassium, from a quart of the water, gives evidence before the
prism of the presence of csesium. But the most remarkable point, chemically,
in the constitution of this water is the unprecedented amount of chloride of
lithium which it contains, and which no doubt will furnish an abundant supply
of the compounds of this alkaline metal.

   Lithium has been found in a great number of springs, but usually in quantity not
exceeding one or two grains of the chloride per gallon. Its extraction from this
water would not be very difficult. The water itself might imdergo a preliminary
concentration by boiling down in a steam-boiler ; the absence of a deposit or " fur '
would render this perfectly feasible ; the concentrated liquid should then be boiled
down till reduced to one-tenth or one-twelfth of its bulk ; to the hot liquid milk of

lime is added, till slightly alkaline, to separate magnesia, then a concentrated solu-

tion of carbonate of sodium is added cautiously to the boiling liquid as long as it
occasions a precipitate ; a granular precipitate of carbonate of calcium is produced,

from which the mother-liquor, now containing alkaline salts only, is easily decanted.

It is further concentrated, part of the chloride of sodium is separated by crystal-
lization, and the lithium is then precipitated as carbonate, by the addition of car-

bonate of sodium in slight excess. The mother-liquor may then be used to fur-

nish compounds of caesium by the process of Bunsen and KirchhofF.

On Reaumur^s Porcelain. By A. Noble.

Circumstances have put me in possession of some beautiful specimens illustrating

Athe devitrification of glass.  drinking-glass, made of ordinai-y flint glass, was

buried in fine sand and exposed to the heat of a pottery-kiln by Mr. Septimus

Powell, of Temple Gate Pottery, Bristol, and cooled gradually with the kiln. It

was perfectly devitrified. Glass containing the greater number of bases devitrified

the most readily. I am also able to show some specimens of light-gi-een bottle-

glass which have cooled very slowly, and in which crystallization is very distinct.

They are from the glass-works of Messrs. Powell and Ricketts, Bristol.

                    On Criule Paraffin Oil. By Dr. B. H. Paul.

   The author remarked that very little attention had hitherto been paid to that
portion of crude paraffin oil which was heavier than water, and its existence had

been denied. He found, however, that the oil obtained from coal, or any similar

material, by distillation at a moderate heat not exceeding low redness, always
contains oils heavier than water and that these oils are precisely the same
as the oils heavier than water, which are contained in the ordinary coal-tar of
gas-works, consisting in both cases chiefly of carbonic acid and a thick pitchy

substance. It was also shown that the product obtained by distilliiig ditferent
varieties of bituminous coal at a low heat differs very considerably in its cha-
                                         --

racter, according' to tlie tind of coal it is obtained from, and that this difference is
mainly due to the relative proportions of oil lighter than water and of oil heavier
than water. In the case of the oil obtained from the kind of coal commonly used
as fuel, the proportion of heavy oil is so large that the product closely resembles
the coal-tar of gas-works in all its outward characters, although the oUs lighter
than water which it contains are identical with those contained in crude paraffin
oil, as it is usually manufactm-ed from particular kinds of coal and other bituminous
minerals, which are exceptional in so far as they yield by distillation a product

containing the light oils in much larger proportions than the heavy oils.

On Useful Applicatioiis of Slag from Iron Smelting. By Dr. B. H. Paul.

He said slag was of a nature between porcelain and glass. Attempts had been

made to cast the slag into blocks as it issued from the furnace, to be afterwards

used as artificial stone, but all attempts of this kind had failed. The application

proposed with slag at the present tmie was to convert it into bricks for building.

AThis was done by a simple and ingenious contrivance.  gentleman had suc-

ceeded in blowing the slag into a state of very fine division, by sending steam or

air into it, just as it flowed from the blast furnace in the liquid state. It was thus

blown into a substance resembling wool in appearance. This substance was taken

and ground into dust, mixed with lime, subjected to powerful pressiu'e, and made

into bricks, of which he exhibited some examples. These bricks required no fire.

After being pressed, they were allowed to dry, and could be used at once, the

influence of the atmosphere producing a slow kind of hardening. It was also

intended to use the powder as a manure.

On the Black Stones which fell from tJie Atmosphere at Birmingham in 1858.
                        By Dr. T. L. Phipson, F.C.S. Lond.

   These stones, which have hitherto been regarded as aerolites, fell at Birming-

ham in gi-eat numbers during a violent storm which broke over that town in the

month of August 1858. Several of these stones have recently been forwarded to

me by Mr. W. B. Beale, in order that I might submit them to analysis. They

are small, angular, and black, presenting here and there a few indications of

crystallization. They act very slightly on a magnetic needle, but the action is
sensible. They give a lightish-coloured streak, and when finely pulverized are
partially soluble in hydrochloric acid. The analysis which I have made of them

has proved to me that these stones are not aerolites, but small fragments of basalt

rock, similar to that which exists at a few leagues from Birmingham, near the

parish of Rowley. They have given me

   The specific gravity of these stones is about 2-7 ; they fuse with some difficulty

on the edges before the blowpipe ; tvhen heated quietly in a platinum crucible, they

emit a marked odour of ozone. It is evident to me that these stones, which fell

in great numbers in Ann-street and other adjacent streets of the town of Bir-
mingham, were can-ied there by a waterspout ; as was also the case, doubtless, with
the curious faU of hay which I observed in London in June 1861, and described
in the Coniptes JRendus of the Paris Academy of Sciences, and the remarkable fall
of ironstone which occurred in August 1841 at Iwan in Hungary. The sizes of
the pieces of this ironstone which fell varied from that of a grain of hemp-seed
to that of a nut. The black stones which fell in Birmingham are about the size
of nuts, to judge from the specimens I have examined.

  Two specimens of these muds were forwarded, not long ago, to my laboratory.

Invalids visiting IscLia plunge their aims, legs, or entire bodies into them, for various

diseases, more particularly for scrofula and rheiunatism. One of the bottles con-
taining these muds was ticketed Fmujo di GurijiteUn, the other Fango del Aritfa,
They diifer very much in appearance and in smell, though they are essentially the
same in composition and properties, being formed of volcanic or felspathic gTains.

quantity of vegetable debris. The grains are composed of lava, green felspar,

   The Italian bottles in which these specimens of the Ischia muds were forwarded

to me, though corked with large glass stoppers, do not close hermetically ; and I have
no doubt that tlie water of these muds, in its natural state, is strongly impregnated
with sulphuretted hydrogen, which has almost entirely escaped from the samples
during the journey. The black colour of the Fango del Aritta is owing to a layer
of black sulphide of iron, foi-med by the action of sulphuretted hydi'ogen upon the

grains of green felspar, which it envelopes completely. "When the mud is exposed

to the air for some time, the black sulphide is gi-adually oxidized, and the grains
assume their original green colour ; in this manner the Fango del Aritta becomes

similar to the Fango di Gurgitella.
    It is remarkable that sulphuretted hydrogen, like carbonic and sidphurous acids,

attacks the iron of the felspar rocks in preference to the alkalies, which are not
attacked at all, for the glassy grains of ryacolite have undergone no decomposition
whatever. Diluted hydrochlonc acid dissolves this black sulphide of iron, formed
on the sm-face of the green grains, with evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen gas.

No iodine or bromine was detected ill either of the muds ; but, by passing a mag-

net through some of the Aritta mud, a number of brilliant black grains, which were
proved to be magnetic oxide of iron, were extracted from it. The water separated
by filtration from the sand, and merely gave indications of lime, sulphuric acid, and
chlorine, and did not ditier from ordinary river-water in composition, except by the
presence of a small proportion of free sulphuretted hydi-ogen gas, which in that of

the Fango del Aritta ouly amoimted to ^^-,"^^^ ths, but I believe the greater por-
                                                                                                                                                                                          ^

   The curious custom of plimging the body into muds of this kind, as a means of

restoring health, is not confined to the island of Ischia. I have lately found that

a similar custom prevails in the neighbourhood of the Salt Lake, Balta Alba, in
the Danubian provinces ; and I have heard that the same practice was once resorted

 to in the south of England.

    The beneficial effects that are said to follow such treatment are probably owing
 as much to the cleansing and stimtdating effect produced by the friction of the grains

 An Account of Apparatus and Processes for tJie Chemical and Photometrical
           Testing of Ilium itmtinf) Gas. By Professor W. B. IIogers.

    Professor Kogers stated that the instruments and processes, of which he pro-
posed to give a shoii; account, had been devised and employed by him as part of
the system of gas inspection which lie had organized for the State of Massachusetts,
and which applied to the mechanical measurement as well as to the photometric
and chemical testing of illuminating gas.

    1. The entire plan comprises the primary determination of the cubic foot,

standard measure, and its convenient adjustment for use in gauging the gaso-
meters employed in meter-testing in different parts of the State. This differs
chiefly from the apparatus in use iu Great Britain in being moveably suspended,
and expelling the measured volume of air by its descent in a tank, the final
reading on the gasometer being taken, after adjusting to zero of pressm-e, by a

pressui-e-gauge of extreme delicacy. Figm-es of the standard appai-atus and the
pressure-gauge were exhibited to the Section.

   2. To give gi'eater facility and certainty to the obser\'ations on the registra-
tion of meters, two contrivances were adopted, the one intended for a ready
and secure adjustment of the connexions at the inlet and the outlet of the meter,
and the other for indicating the temperature and the pressure of the air or gas at
these points. The former apparatus consists of a clamp com2)osed of two metallic
limbs, hung b\' pivots on a central piece, and capable of being fixed at any required
degree of opening by the action of a screw passing through the central piece.

When thus firmly attached to the naiTow or wide neck of the meter, as the

case might be, the clamp is used as a gallows-screw, by having a second screw
working within the screw of the clamp-head already described, which is made
to bear upon the end of the connecting tube, so as to make the junctiu^e imfail-

ingly tight.

   The other contrivance to be applied to the meter, in observing its registration,
is a short horizontal connecting tube, whose opening at one end is in a flat surface
at the lower side, capable of being secured by the apparatus just described upon
the inlet or outlet of the meter. Near this end the tube enlarges to a little chamber,
in which is inserted the small cylindrical bulb of a delicate thermometer and one
end of a siphon-gauge, so as to enable the observer to read the temperature of the
entering and issuing air, and to determine its ])ressiire, or to test the meter for
leakage. On the outlet side, this appendage is prolonged by a short rubber-tube,

which can be closed by a clip at the moment of completing the registration. And

the outer end of this tube is Im-nished with a disk-stopper, which, by turning more

or less, varies the apertiu-e to secure the proper rate of transit of the air or gas.
   3. For the chemical testing of gas, Professor liogers devised a form of simple

eudiometer, which has been found to answer the pur]^)ose better than those usually
employed in gas inspection, both on the ground of convenience and accuracy. It
consists of a tube with a cylindrical enlargement at the closed end, the tube being
graduated to xa^o^ths and tenths of troths of the entire capacity. This at its open
end is fitted -nath a hollow stopper accurately ground, and intended to hold the
several liquid absorbents used in the successive expeiiments. The entire tube, vnth

enlargement, is enclosed in a water-case, consisting of a slender cylindrical vessel of

glass filled vnt\i water at the teniperatiu-e of the room, the open mouth of the tube
projecting slightly from the cork-stopper of the case. Through the gi-eat specific

heat of water, it is found that the temperature of the gas, while submitted to
successive testings, is almost completely protected from the effect of the necessary
handling of the apparatus.

   With this eudiometer it is quite easy to determine, first, the percentage of

carbonic acid in the gas, then the illuminating hydrocarbons, and then the
oxygen and the carbonic oxide, by introducing in the hollow stopper the appro-

priate reagents. The hydrogen and light carburetted hydrogen may be sub-

sequently detei-mined by explosion of the residue with oxygen, in an" apparatus
consisting mainly of two glass tubes, united below by a long loop of rubber-tube,
40 RJiPOKT 1864.

 one of the glass tubes whicli is fixed serving as llie chamber for explosion and
 measurement, and the other moveable up and down on the vertical frame serving
 to adjust the level of mercury before and after tlie experiment, and also to bring
 the gas, after explosion, into contact with potassa for the removal of carbonic acid.

    4. For determining the amount of sulphur present in gas, use is made of the

 ordinary process of slow combustion under a funnel-tube connected with a Liebig

condenser ; but an improved arrangement is adopted, by which a supply of am-
 monia is introduced, at some didunce above thefiame, where it is free from the danger
 of combustion, and, combining with the sulphur products of the combustion, secures
their retention in the collected liquid. This is effected by causing the stream of
water which siipplies the condenser to draw a small amoimt of air by aspiration

 into the descending feed-pipe. This air, collected in a separate vessel, or in the

enlarged head of the condenser, is, by its own compressure, driven through a small

bottle containing dilute ammonia, and thence delivered by a slender tube into the
neck of the condensing tube some inches above the gas-flame. This apparatus, as
well as the improved eudiometer, besides their value in the ordinary routine of
gas inspection, may, it is thought, be of use in various laboratory experiments.

    5. The great difficulty of determining the illuminating power of gas depends, as
all know, on the want of a reliable and imiform standard of light to which to
refer. The imcertainty of the ordinary photometric determinations, by the use of
the standard candle, resulting from the imavoidable variability of the candle, is
further increased by the fact, that the unit is so small that the observer is confined
to the part of the scale where a very slight change in the position of the disk
makes a great difference in the reading. To secure a more uniform light, and a
larger unit of comparison. Professor Rogers has used a kerosene lamp with a flat
flame, limited at the sides and top by a strip of platinum foil. This he found
capable of affording a very uniform disk of light equal to about 1\ candles. The
lamp is supported in a balance of pecidiar construction, enabling the observer to
mark exactly the rate at which the oil is consumed in each stage of the experi-
ment, and to make such corrections as are needed on this account. Although far
from affording a perfect standard, this arrangement promises much more satis-
factory results than the ordinary method of observation.

    Neither of the chemical processes referred to were put forward as replacing the
refined and e.xact methods of gaseous analysis with which chemists are fiimiliar.
They have been found convenient for the purposes of ordinary gas inspection, and
are of such accuracy as not only to serve this object, but to prove usefid in the
laboratory assays where the highest degi-ee of exactness is not demanded.

   In conclusion. Professor Rogers made a brief reference to his experiments on the

influence exerted by the presence of carbonic acid in gas on its illuminating power.

He found that even the small amount of this impurity, which in some manufac-

tories is allowed to remain in the gas, produces a sensible diminution of the light.
The effect varies with the quality of the illuminating gas, and was found to range
from three to nearly five per cent, of the illuminating pow;er for each per cent,
of carbonic acid present in the mixture. In a series of experiments with gas
successively mingled with larger and larger quantities of carbonic acid, it was
found that 58 per cent, of carbonic acid, although it did not prevent combustion,
rendered the flame so dim as to be inappreciable on the photometric screen.

   On an Invention hy Mr. Cornelius, of Philadeljyhia, for Lighting Gas by
                      Electricity. By Professor W. B. Eogeks.

   The electrical apparatus was attached to a common gas-burner. It was an ap-

plication of the principle of frictional electricity (the apparatus being a modified
form of electrophorus), and, on the removal of a stopper of vulcanite, the friction

generated an electric chai-ge, and the gas was instantly ignited. It could be ar-
ranged so as at the same instant to light the whole of the burners in a room.

         Contribntio')iS towards the Foundation of Quantitative Photography.

tative stage ; and the author communicated the results of experiments (can-ied out
in his laboratory by Mr. A. McDougall, B.Sc.) instituted for the purpose of estab-
lishing facts upon which a quantitative photography might be foimded, the method
being based upon the expeiimental law, discovered by Professor Bunsen and himself,
to the eflect that a constant product of the intensities of the acting light into the
times of exposure always corresponded to a constant tint on the photogi-aphic paper.
Hence, if several differently sensitive prepared papers are exposed to a constant
light for varying periods of time, until they all exhibit the same degree of tint, the

reciprocals of these times of exposure represent the relative sensitiveness of the

papers. By the help of the pendulum-photometer, the times during which the

papers had been exposed were ascertained, and the degree of tint attained was read
off by the soda light. Tables were consti-ucted showing the variation in the sensi-
tiveness produced by increasing the strength of the solution of salts emploj'ed, and
curves drawn representing this relation. The salts used were chloride of sodium,
chloride of potassium, chloride of ammonium, and bromide of potassium. The
next point ascertained was the fact that the sensitiveness of the paper did not vary
with vaiiation of the base with which the chlorine or bromine was combined. The
third portion of the experiments referred to the comparison of the relative sensi-
tiveness of the chloride, bromide, and iodide, and mixtures of these.

       Description of a Chemical Photometer for Meteorological Ohservation,

                By Professor Roscoe, B.A., Ph.D., F.E.S., F.C.S.

   The author exhibited and described a modification of the pendulum chemical
photometer, by means of which the meteorological registi-ation of the chemical

action of light may be accm-ately and easily earned on. No less than forty curves

of the daily chemical intensity at Manchester, in the year 1863-64, have thus been

made. The author believes that the method is now so simple that such a series of
determinations may be carried on at any meteorological observator}'.

Note on the Existence of Lithium, Strontium, and Copper in the Bath Waters,

                By Professor Eoscoe, B.A., Ph.D., F.E.S. , F.C.S.

   At the request of Sir Charles Lyell, the author imdertook the examination of the
residue obtained by the evaporation of the Bath waters (King's Bath spring) by
spectrum-analysis. No trace of barium was foimd ; but strontium was present in
quantities sufficientlj' large to enable it to be easily detected. The portion of the
deposit soluble in dilute hydrochloric acid was freed from alkaline earths by several

precipitations with carbonate and oxalate of ammonia, and in this precipitate
strontium was again detected. The magnesiimi was next separated by ignition of
the mixed chlorides with oxide of mercury ; and, on examining the portions of the
residue soluble in water, the red lithium line was plainly visible. In salts derived
from twenty gallons of water the author was stiU unable to detect the smallest
traces of either rubidium or cfesium. In the course of both analyses the presence
of copper was detected.

        On some probable New Sources of Thallium. By "W. L. Scott.

   Some time back, during the examination of a fine but highly ferruginous sand,

obtained from the neighbourhood of "Whitby, it struck the author as remarkable

that a certain precipitate, which he knew to be entirely free from both barium and
copper, should tint a hydrogen flame green. On going into the matter somewhat
more carefuUy, he found that this precipitate exhibited the thallic spectrum very
distinctly'. From this he was led to examine other sands; amongst them, those
from Alum Bay, Isle of Wight, and some others. The sands containing the thal-

lium are the rock-sands; the sea-shore sand, as a rule, contains no thallium.

Many of the deeply colom-ed clays which alternate with the sands at ^\^lum Bay

also give indications, more or less marked, of containing thallium.

his aim had been to erect works on sound chemical principles. The fii-st furnace

he erected was successful in calcining the smaU ores with a small expenditure of

fuel and labour, with elimination of all the sulphur from the ores if that was re-

quired ; and it enabled him to send all the sidphur so eliminated into the vitriol-
chambers as sulphurous-acid gas. Very soon afterwards he erected additional

furnaces, and all the sulphuric acid made at his works since the end of 1861 had

been made from these small ores by similar fm-naces. The amount of sulphur

wasted in copper-smelting, and which could be economized for the use of such

calcining furnaces as he had erected, was something enormous. It had been

estimated at 70,000 tons per annum, which at the present time would be worth

A455,000/.  more recent improvement, and which he has now in successful ope-

ration, is the combining of these calcining furnaces with the ordinary copper-smelt-

ing furnace, in such a manner that the flame of the smelting furnace, instead of

passing directly to the stack or chimney, is made to pass imder the calciner, and

affords suflicient heat to efiect the calcination of the ore required by the smelter

thus at once saving 30 to 33 per cent, of all the fuel required for copper-smelting,

that being about the proportion required by the calcination part of the process.

Another advantage of this mode is that the calciner is so placed that when a

charge of ore is required for the smelter, it is at once passed in a red-hot condition

by a shoot from the calciner directly on to the bed of the smelter. In the present

mode of manufacture, the ore is dropped out of the calciner into a cave under it,

and is there di-edged with water imtil completely damp, and by barrows is then

removed, and in this wet condition is thrown into the highly heated smelting fur-

nace. The saving of fuel, labour, destruction of fiu-naces, and nuisance from escap-

ing gases must be very evident.

   It will be apparent that anhydrous rosaniline is just equal to a base consisting of
two atoms of toluyl and one of phenyl along with three atoms of nitrogen.

   This manner of constructing the foi-mula of rosaniline, which appears to be adopted
by some chemists, derives a remarkable confirmation from the circumstance dis-
covered by Hofmann, that it is requisite to employ a mixture of toluidine and
aniline in the manufacture of rosaniline, neither toluidine nor aniline alone being

capable of yielding the dye.

   Notwithstanding this capital fact, it is quite certain that rosaniline is not

   Hofmanu's beautiful research relatiug to this transformation of aniline red into
aniline blue leaves no doubt that three atoms of hydrogen are concerned.

   Again, the iodides of the alcohol radicrds react upon rosauiline, producing
ethylated bases. Hofmann has not yet published his research on "Ethyl-rosa-
niline," but, judging from the quantity of iodide of ethyl actually destroyed iu the
operation, there can be little doubt tliat substitution goes on to the length of three

atoms.

   In order to judge whether this action upon the " hydrogen atoms " in rosauiline
must be looked upon as a very close representation of the action upon the hydrogen

atoms in common ammonia, 1 have inquired whether Cai'ey Lea's method 'was ap-

plicable to rosauiline.

   Carey Lea, as is well known, has sho-\vn that nitrate of ethyl occupies a place
among the very few ethers capable of forming ethylated ammonias by reaction upon
ammonia. I have recently succeeded in obtaining ethylated rosauiline by the action
of nitrate of ethyl upon rosauiline.

   From all this it results that the rational formula of rosauiline must display three

atoms of hydrogen in association with nitrogen.

  A consideration of the entire case leads me to propose the following formula :

                          fNHCeH,                          Tvpe.

   I here wi-ite rosanUine on the " ethylene" tj'pe, replacing three atoms of typical
hydrogen by three atoms of phenylamid.

   Just as ethylene tends to take up the representatives of two atoms of hydi-ogen,
and thereby passes into a body of the "hydride of ethyl" type, so rosauiline tends
to take up two atoms of hydrogen, thereby becoming a representative of hydride of

ethyl.

The fourth atom of hydrogen, being in direct association with carbon, is not easily

replaceable.

   The power that nitrogen has of being either three or five atomic is, of course, the
explanation of the mono-acid and tri-acid salts. There should be Uiewise bi-acid

salts.

   * The first suggestion of the kind of change which takes place when aniline red becomes
aniline blue was, I behave, due to me. In the winter of 1862-63 I explained it by saying

that anUine red lost hydrofrm and gained phenyl ; supporting my view by adducing the

faot that the red gave more than its weight of blue while ammonia' was evolved.

   Quite in accordance with tlie formula is the fact that distillation with potash

gives much aniline and a residue of carbon.

   The production of a colouring-matter by the action of oxalic acid upon phenyl-
alcohol in presence of sulphuric acid is a very remarkable thing. As yet no attempt
has been made to give any explanation of the changes which take place during this
process, and yet considerable quantities of a dye-stuff are now being made in France

On a curious Example of Etherijication. By J. Alfred "Wankltk.

Some years ago Frankland showed that iodide of ethyl and water yield hydriodic

acid and ether, on being exposed to the action of a temperature of 150° C. imder

pressure                   2C,H,H-H,0 = (C,H,),0+2HI.

I have recently observed a somewhat similar reaction which, however, takes place
at temperatures so low as 100° C.

  When rosaniline, iodide of ethyl, and alcohol are heated together to 100° C. for

about twelve hours, there is fonned, in addition to the iodide of ethyl-rosaniline, a

quantity of common ether. The production of this ether may be explained as

follows :

TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS,       45

   The three atoms of hydriodic acid resulting' from reaction between three atoms
of iodide of ethyl and one atom of rosaniline are thus appropriated ; one atom goes
to saturate the ethyl-rosaniline, and the remaining two react upon the alcohol

                   2m+2aH,0 = 2Pn+H,0+(C,H,),0.

Or we may suppose that the production of ether takes place quite directly

                           C,H,I+C,H,0 = HI+(C,H,,XO.

   Whichever way we regard the reaction, the fact is deserving of attention. Rea-
soning upon it, we shoidd be led to expect the production of ether in the process
for the preparation of the ethylated ammonias, i. e. when we heat iodide of ethyl
with alcoholic solution of ammonia. Common ether is likewise to be looked for in
the preparation of various compound ethers by digesting different salts with iodide

of ethyl and alcohol.

  I am informed that this formation of ether as a by-product in the manufacture

of ethylated rosaniline has also been noticed by Continental manufacturers.

The age of geological discover}^ is by many persons thought to have passed away
with Hutton and Werner, Humboldt and Yon Buch, Smith and Cuvier, Cony-
beare and Buckland, Forbes and De la Beche ; and they regard as almost final the

honoured researches of Sedgwick and Mm-chison, and Lyell. Yet in this very
district, the most carefully examined perhaps of aU the richly fossiliferous tracts
of England, oiu- friend Mr. C. Moore is finding a multitude of interesting forms of
life of the later triassic age, and is thus enriching in an unexpected manner the
catalogue of fossils in Britain. Nor is the practical application of our science less

actively exercised. In this very district Mr. Sanders has just completed that ad-
mirable Survey of£the strata on the large scale of 4 inches to a mile, and showing
every field, which is suspended before you. Su- R. Murchison has informed us of
the further proof of the extension of coal under the Permians of Nottinghamshire

and at this very Meeting we receive through the same channel, from Mr. M'Kenzie,

the news of the finding of an additional bed of coal in Australia, thirty miles from
any former known site of coal, the bed being 38 feet thick and of good quality.

   Nothing is better settled than the series of great events in om- geological history

yet even now we are rejoicing over the large addition made to this history by the

discovery of the richly fossiliferous beds of St. Cassian and Kossen, by which the
triassic faima is enlarged, and the means of comparing Palaeozoic and Mesozoic life
augmented by some hundreds of forms, including some genera of the older, and
others of the newer systems. The Director of the National Survey has decided to

give to these strata in England and Wales a distinct colour on his map and a

definite name.
   But a few years since, the varied strata of marine and freshwater origin above

the chalk were carelessly, if not contemptuouslv, classed as ' superficial deposits ;

now they have acquired a large and regular history, embracing a gi-eat succession

of organic life, in the sea and on the land, which is appropriately crowned by the
works of intelligent man. Not long since, the ' diluvium ' or ' drift ' was merely

an iU-uaderstood basis for ill-considered speculation : now we have classified its
parts ; have begun to survey the movements of land and sea which preceded and

accompanied these latest superficial accumulations; and have even ventured to
apply to them measures of time, in a continuous chronology.

   The new problems opened by these researches, the inferences to which they

Howlead, and the speculations wliicli they suggest, require only to be named.

to explain the all but universal glaciation of the mountain regions of Europe--
once, or perhaps twice, since the era of the Crag ; how to trace the course and
limits of those gelid waters which since that era rose to half the heiglit of
HelvelljTi and Snowdon ; how to account for the changes of physical geogi-aphy
which Allowed Hippopotami to be buried in the sediments of a Yorkshire river,
troops of Mammoths to crowd the Cotswold Hills, and the mingled remains of
Reindeer and jSIan to fill the caverns of the South of France--these and many
more questions of equal importance occupy the attention of geologists, and give a

special interest to the later geological periods.

  --In each of these cases, and in all which come before geologists for interpretation,

there is one general rule : we compare always the ancient phenomena with the
most similar effects we can find of forces now in action.

   As in existing natm-e the amount of eftect produced by known causes varies

--with the conditions of each case as the sun's eftect varies from hour to hour, from
--day to night, from summer to winter, and from year to year as the force of

movino- water is greater or less according to the slope of the ground, and the

sea's movement is modified by the age of the moon and the position of land
so in earlier nature the combinations of phejiomena varied, and the measures of

efl'ect were modified accordingly. In another point of view the aspect of nature is
found to be variable, and subject to cycles of change, periods of gi-eater and less

efiect of particular forces which in their own nature are constant. The distance of
the earth from the sun is not constant, the form of its orbit is not constant, it was
not alwavs nor will always be nearer to the sun in winter than in sunmier. From
these varied conditions, which are measured by long astronomical periods, cycles of

 oreater and less heating eftect on the earth in general, and on parts of it in parti-

 cular, arise ; so that specitlations as to the causes of the differences of climate during

 o-eolo<rical periods are entirely incomplete if we leave out of -view these real and

 definite sources of terrestrial vicissitude. "Whether they are sufiicient, and justly

 applicable to the facts established in geology', is a proper subject of deliberate

 inquiry.

   Among the facts put in evidence by geology regarding the fonner condition of

 the land and sea, none are so con\-incing of great change and systematic diversity as

 the remains of plants and animals. By appeals to these innumerable -wntnesses,
 conclusions of much importance are maintained, touching the greater warmth of the
 carboniferous land, and the colder climate of the later csenozoic seas. By the same

 testimonv, it appears that over every part of the eai-th's surface, in everj' class of

 oro-anic life, the whole series of created forms has been changed many times.
    Have we measured these changes of climate, and assigned their true physical

 causes ? Have we determined the law of the successive variations of life, and de-
 clared the physiological principles on which tlie differences depend ? No ! the

 variations of climate must be further investigated, the limits of specific diversity

 more surely defined, before we can give clear answers to these critical questions.

     Late researches, partly arcbreological and partly geological, both in England and

 France, have been held to prove the contemporaneity of Man and the Mammoth in

 the northern zones of the world. Have we, then, been too confident in our belief that
 the human period was long posterior to, and strongly marked off" from, that of the
  Cavern Bear and the woolly Rhinoceros ? Did the races of Hysena and Hippopo-

 tamus remain inhabitants of Europe till a comparatively modern epoch, or was Man

  in possession of the earth in times far eai'lier than history and tradition allow ?

     The prevalent opinion seems to be, that as variations of tlie fonns of life are ex-

  tremely slow in existing nature, for every case of considerable change in the pre-

  dominant types of ancient plants and animals, very long intervals of time must be
 allowed to' have elapsed. If in some thousands of years of human experience no

  very material change has happened in our -w-ild plants or wild animals, or in cultivated
  grains, or domestic bu-ds and quadrupeds, it is evident that no considerable change.?

  of this kind can arise from such causes as are now in action vdthout the aid of

  periods of time not contemplated in our chronology. I]8timated in this way, the

 --antiquity of the earth grows to be inconceivable not to be counted by centimes, or
 --mvriads of years not to be really compassed by the imderstanding of men, whose
                                                                                                                ;:

individual age is less than a century, and whose histories and traditions, however

freely rendered, fall short of a hundred centuries. The whole human period, as we

have been accustomed to view it, is but a unit in the vast sum of elapsed time

yet in all those innumerable ages the same forces were seated ia the same particles

of matter; the same laws of combination prevailed in inorganic and in living

bodies ; the same general influences resided on the surfaces or governed the masses

of the planets, in their ever-changing paths rovmd the sun.

   All natural effects are perfonned ia time, and when the agency is imiform, are
in proportion to the time. And though the agency be not imifoiin, if the law of

its variation be known, the time consumed in producing a given effect can be

determined by calculation. Geological phenomena of every order can be expressed

in terms of magnitude, as the uplifting of mountains, the deposition of strata, the

numerical changes of the forms of life. The time required to produce these effects

can be calculated if we know at what rate in time, whether uniform or not, they

were produced : if we know, not the true rate, but the limits nnthin which it must

have operated, the result of the calculation will have a corresponding imcertaiaty
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

if we have no knowledge of the rate, calculations are out of the question.

   In applj-ing this general view to the history of the earth, philosophers of emi-

mnence physical science have employed diflerent considerations and obtained a

variety of results. The conclusions of two eminent mathematicians which have

lately appeared may be cited with advantage.

  A careful computation by Professor W. Thomson, on selected data, which deter-

mine the rate of^ cooling of earthy masses, assigTis 98,000,000 years for the whole

Seriod of the cooling of the earth's crust from a state of fusion to its present con-

ition ; so that, in his judgment, within one liundred millions of years aU our

speculations regarding the solid earth must be limited*.

On the other hand, Professor Haughton finds, from the data which he adopts,

1018 millions of years to have elapsed while the earth was cooled from 212 F.

to 122° F., at which temperatiu-e we may suppose the waters to have become

habitable                                       and  1280 millions of  years  more,  ia  cooling from  122° to  77°, which is
                                             ;

assumed to represent the climate of the later Eocene period in Britain. Com-

putations of this kind cannot be applied except on the large scale here exemplified

and they lose all their value in the eyes of those who deny the general doctrine
of a cooling globe t. Much as these periods exceed our conception, they appear to

be in harmony with the results of astronomical research, which contemplates spaces,

motions, and cycles of periods too vast for words to express, or numerals to coimt, or

symbols to represent.

 --The greatest difficulty in obtaining trustworthy results as to elapsed time is

found where it was least expected among the later cfenozoic deposits from rivers

and lakes, and on the variable shores of the sea. This is the more disappointing

because within this period falls the history of the human race. Taking as its earlier

limit the latest wide prevalence of glaciers in Europe, attempts have been made to

measure its diu'ation by several processes. Quite recently Mr. CrollJ recalls

--attention to an astronomical cause of change of temperature the varying excentri-
--city of the earth's orbit by which in a small degree the total qxiantity of heat

received in the earth in a year, and in a much greater degree the distrihdion of

this heat on the opposite cu-cumpolar spaces, are altered §. The effect of this at

particidar epochs would be, on one hemisphere an approximate equality of summer

and winter heat, on the other an augmented difference between them. If at the

epoch of maximum excentricity the earth was in aphelion dm-iug our winter, a

great accession of snow might arise and be continued for ages, and glaciers have a

large augmentation ; under the conti-ary circumstances, less snow and shortened

glaciers. To this latter condition the present state of the north corresponds and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

by consulting the astronomical tables, it appears that a condition of extreme glaci-

ation, dependent on the maximum excentricity of the earth's orbit, cannot have

happened witliin tlie last 100,000 years. This, it -will be remembered, corresponds
with the conjectm-e of oiu- President regarding the possible antiquity of the liuvi-
atile gravel-beds with flint implements at St. Acheul ; and with the computation

of M. Morlot, of the age of the oldest gravel-cone of La Tiniere on the Lake of

Geneva, which he supposes to have followed the latest extreme extension of glaci-

ation in the Alps.

   Quite a different conclusion, however, was presented a few years since by a
German mathematician, Ilerr Adhemar *, who, reflecting on the difference of mean

--annual temperature of the two hemispheres of the earth dependent on the in-

equality of the half-yearly periods, our hemisphere having now the advantage of

--position finds that within each half ' tropical ' period (about 10,500 years) snows

would gather and glaciers thicken round one pole, to be afterwards melted
while glaciation was spreading round the other. Thus, periodical deluges, at
intervals of 10,500 jears, are found by this inquirer to be part of the system of

nature.

   The opinion, however, has long been growing among geologists, that it is rather
by rising and falling of the land, and displacement of the sea, that the alternations
of snows and floods must be explained, which are admitted to have visited the
moimtain regions of the north. In Switzerland two great extensions of ice in

--former times have been traced by Escher and the eminent geologists of that country
    the latter one con-esponding perhaps to the age of our glacial drift.
   The melting of snow and ice in the valleys of the Alps is far more rapid under

the influence of certain winds than by the direct effect of simshine. Withdraw
the hot Fohn for a season, the glaciers would renew their advance ; let it cease, or
lose its specific action for a centm-y, the progress of the ice would be considerable.
In many centuries the Rhone glacier might reach again to Sion, Villeneuve, and
Lausanne ; in many thousands of years, all the valleys, and lakes, and borders of
the Alps might be reoecupied by ice.

  Now the southerly wind, which so rapidly strips the alpine peaks of their snows,

di'aws its melting power from the hot northern tracts of Africa. Were these tracts

again covered, as once they were, with an expansion of the Mediterranean, the

--wind woidd lose its excessive dissolving power, snows would gather above, and

glaciers extend below to levels and distances now quite unattainable without some

great physical change.

    Great phi/sical change, then, is the inevitable antecedent to extensive glaciation

and abimdant dissolution of ice round the mountains of the north. Astronomical
vicissitudes returning in cycles of long duration, changes of level of the land, ex-
pansions and contractions of the sea, deviations of the currents of the ocean,

--alterations in the prevalent direction and quality of the winds whichever of these

causes we assume, and however we combine them, it is e%ident that we are ap-

pealing from the existing order of nature and the present measures of effect in
time, to some other combination of natural agencies, some other standard of
physical energy. The conclusion is obvious. Inductive geology refuses to accept
definite periods for phenomena produced imder conditions not yet really determined.

   I will not, by any further observations, discourage you from exploring this
attractive field of research, or restrain the freedom with which you will desire to

--discuss it. Only let me add, that to one fresh from the Alps from the old

Pfahlbauten of the lakes, and much older monuments of overspreading snow and
gliding ice, the later ages of geology and the earlier ages of mankind seem to be

fairly united in one large field of inquiiy. That it must be trodden with heedful
steps, and demands all possible care in the scrutiny of facts, in the estimation of
natural agencies, and in the choice of right measm-es of time, before the Pleistocene,

Quaternary, or Hmuan period can be said to be accurate!}- known by natural phe-

nomena, even in this the best-examined part of the world, is obvious.

   But the same remark applies to every one of the many perplexing questions
which have been considered by geologists. By following the same good processes

of strict inquiry and cautious interpretation which have settled those difficulties,

we \i\AY hope to settle this. " Let every one join in the effort, and bring selected

                On some New Points in the Structure of Palcechinus.
                        By W. Helliee Bailt, F.L.S., F.G.S.

 --The genus Palachinus a fossil Echinoderm of great beauty, which is almost en-
--tirely confined to the Carboniferous epoch includes several species, all the described

forms of which occiur in Ireland. On examining a fine series of these fossils, in-

cluding the original figiu'ed specimens in the ' Synopsis of Carboniferous Fossils of
Ireland,' for the purpose of comparison, in the collection of Sir Richard Griffith,

Bart., the author was fortunate enough to find amongst them one belonging to-
the species (P. eler/ans) which was sufficiently perfect to enable him to ti-ace out

--the arrangement of the plates compo.-^ing the apical disk an important part of

the test or shell, which had not, he believed, hitherto been described. The great
difference between these ancient Echini and those of more recent date, consists in
the possession hj the former of a much more numerous series of interambulacral
plates, and a corresponding larger number of rows of holes, or poriferous zones ; the
genus Palcechinus, as far as at present known, having firom four to seven columns
of these interambidacral plates, whilst the Echini of the Secondary, Tertiary, and

Recent periods are confined to two rows only. It became, therefore, a matter of
interest as to whether the plates composing the apical disk woidd exhibit any
change corresponding with that of the great increase in the number of the inter-

ambulacral plates. By the fortimate discovery of this specimen, it was found that
in the Palcechinus the principal plates are the same in number and position, although
differing somewhat in their proportions ; there are therefore five genital, including

one larger than the others, which appears to be the madreporiform plate, but which

is imperfect, and five ocular plates ; the latter being much larger than usual in

more recent forms, and the genital shorter in proportion to their breadth ; there
are inner circles of ten sur-anal and a similar number of anal plates. The great
peculiarity, and most remarkable difference between this part of the structure of

Palcechinus and the recent Echinidffi, consists in the double perforation of the ocular

and triple perforation of the genital plates, .\nother addition to the sti-ucture of

this interesting Palfeozoic Echinus, not hitherto published, is that of the spines,

which the author had some time previously observed on a specimen of the same

species (P. eleffans), in the collection of the Geological Survey of Ireland, from the

same locality, Hook Point, Comity of We.xford, a number of the minute spines still

remaining attached to the plates, the principal tubercles on which are seen to be

distinctly perforated, and smTOunded by a circle of smaller tubercles. He found

these spines to be a little less than the tenth of an inch in length, and, on exami-

nation with the microscope, are seen to be longitudinally situated.

On the Occurrence of Fish Pe^nains in the Old Peel Sandstone at Portishead,
             near Bristol. By W. Helliee Bailt, F.L.S., F.G.S.

The author stated that, having had occasion to \'isit Portishead about two years

previously, he was invited to examine the collection of fossils made by the Rev. B.

Blenkiron, a gentleman resident in that neighbourhood, now curate of that parish.

Amongst those shown to him were some slabs which had been collected from the

shingle of the beach. Upon these he observed bones and scales of fish, some of

which he was enabled to identify with characteristic Old Red Sandstone species.
On examining the cliftj he was successful in obtaining, from the base of a conglo-

merate bed, an additional scale to one he had identified as Holojytychius nobilissimus.

On a subsequent and recent visit, he made a more detailed examination, collecting

other fish remains, of a similar character, associated with plants, from red flaggy

beds, exposed on the shore between high and low water. He described the geology

of the parish of Portishead as presenting many featm-es of interest, independent of

its other local attractions, such as beauty of scenery, &c. Portishead Point, to the

north, consists of a steep ridge of carboniferous limestone, the beds dipping at a

considerable angle, about 60^ N.N.E. ; some of tbem being very lossiliferoiis. The
lower beds, which occasionally appear, for a short distance, along the north shore of
Wood-hill Bay, are of a reddish tint, and sometimes full of crinoidal joints, accom-
panied by a few corals, Michelinea, &c. Beyond this the shore of the bay becomes
flat for about a quarter of a mile, the beach being covered with shingle, principally
derived from the Old Red Sandstone cliffs, from whence the fish remains were ob-
tained. The beds forming the cliffs, consisting of deep red shales and sandstone, com-
mence a little to the south-west of Beach Cottage, rising gradually, and continuing,
with tolerable uniformity, for rather more than eleven chains ; their greatest height
being about 34 feet. The ground above this, at the commencement of Portishead
Down, attains, however, more to the south, a considerable elevation, 364 feet being

marked on the map as its highest part, near Down Farm. This ti-act of Old Red

Sandstone extends along the coast, to the south-west, for about four miles, being
occasionally exposed on the beach, and sometimes covered imconformably by a
great conglomerate, composed of angiilar and partial!}' rounded blocks of limestone,
&c., imbedded in a yellow cementing paste (one of these blocks measm-ing nearly
6 feet in length)? This in'egular deposit was formerly called Dolomitic Conglome-

rate, but is now considered to be part of the New Red Sandstone series. Diagrams,

showing horizontal and vertical sections of the cliff', were exhibited, measurements
of the principal beds having been taken at each chain for that pm-pose. The series

of deposits were described as consisting of alternations of deep red, micaceous,
flaggy beds, and shales varpng in thickness, with thick-bedded compact red and
yellow sandstones and quartzose conglomerates, the general dip being about 20° south.
The fish remains alluded to in this communication, of which enlarged drawings were
exhibited, were foimd Ijoth in the conglomerate and the micaceous flags ; they con-
sisted of scales of Huloptychius nobi/issimns and Glyptolepis elegans, with detached

bones, and a fragment of scale ha'\'ing an external ornamentation like that of
Bothriolepis or Astcrolepis ; together with what appeared to be fin-rays of a fish

like Glyjjtolepis or Platygnathus, in a yellowish sandstone.

      On the Foramimfera of the Middle and Upper Lias of Somersetshire.
                              By Henry B. Brady, F.L.S.

   This paper was presented to the Section as a sort of supplement to Mr. Charles
Moore's paper on the geology of the district. After enumerating the few scat-
tered memoirs which form the scanty literature of the subject, the author gave a
brief outline of the great Nodosarian gi'oup, to which almost all the Rhizopods of
the Upper and Middle Lias belong, particularizing some of the more important forms
which occur in the district. Passing alliusion was also made to the so-called
Nummulite of the Lias, and this organism was assigned to a much lower type
(Invohitina) than the true Nummulites. The author stated that he was at present
engaged upon the Liassic Foraminifera generally, and exhibited a series of draw-
ings, made from specimens in Mr. C. Moore's collection, of the species occurring
in the upper and middle portion of the series.

On the Bhcetic (or Penarth) Beds of the Neir/hhourhood of Bristol and the
   South- West of England. By Henry W. Bristow, F.B.S., F.G.S., of the

    Geological Survey of Great Britain. Communicated by Sir Hoderick I.
   MuncHisoN, K.C.B., D.G.L., LL.D., F.R.S.

   In this paper the author stated that, having received orders from the Directors
of the Geological Survey to ascertain whether the Rhretic beds were sufficiently
developed in this country to be represented by a distinct colour on the one-inch

maps, he visited several localities in the spring of the present year, and made de-
tailed sections of the vfirious beds at Saltford, Pyle Hill, and Uphill near Bristol
Aust and Garden Clifi'on the banks of the Severn ; Combe Hill near Cheltenham;
"Watchett in Somersetshire, and Penarth near Cardifl"--in all which places, in addi-
tion to the strata being carefully measured bed by bed, the fossils were also identi-

fied and noted on the spot by Mr. Etheridge, the Palaeontologist to the Geological
Survey. The Rhtetic beds, although not always exposed, or at times only imper-
fectly visible, after careful searching, were found to be of invariable occurrence

over the entire area examined, between the Red Marls of the Keuper and the base
of the Lias ; and they were mapped by Mr. Bristow during the present summer, iii
the country round Bristol, as well as at Penai'th and other places in the West of

England.

   The general section of the Rhsetic beds was described as consisting of a central
mass of black, thinly laminated shales (weathering into paper-shale), with thin
occasional bands of hard and tough, blue-grey, coarsely-fissile limestone, very
imlike those of the Lias in appearance, and containing great numbers of a highly

characteristic shell (Pecten valoniensis), as also do the shales of the other emi-
nently distinctive shells, Aviada contorta, Cardimn rka-ticion, &c.

    At Aust, Patchway, and other p'aces north of Bristol, and likewise at Penarth,
a thin layer of sandstone is met with near the base of those black shales, which is
often very pyritiferous, of a brecciated structure, and frequently crowded with
bones, teeth, coprolites, and other remains of lishes, to which the name of " Aust
Bone-bed " has been given by collectors, in consequence of its well-known occur-

rence in the cliffs of the localitj' in question.

   The central mass of black shales rests upon a series of hard and soft greenish
marls, which pass by an almost insensible downward passage into the red and
variegated marls of the Keuper, so that it is scarcely possible to adopt any other
line of demarcation on a map than the top of the great mass of the red beds of the

latter series.

   The uppermost division of the Rhsetic beds, lying at the base of the Ijias, con-
sists of beds of marl and marly (argillaceous) limestone, composed in the upper

part of beds of cream-coloured or nearlj- white argillaceous limestone, breaking with
a smooth conchoidal fracture, and with sharp-cutting splintery edges (and closely
resembling in appearance the lithographic limestone of Solenhofen), to which the

name of " White Lias " is given by certain quaiTymen in the West of England.
   The curious stone called Gotham Marble, to which the name " Landscape Stone'

has been given on account of the fanciful resemblance which the darker delinea-
tions sho^%Ti on its fractured surface bear to a landscape, with trees, water, &c., is
of almost invariable occurrence at the base of the White Lias series, and was found
of much use in indicating the position of the upper boundary of the Rhsetic beds,
especially when (as is the case over a large part of the area north of Bristol and
elsewhere) the " WTiite Lias " beds of the quaiTymen are altogether wanting, or
only very attenuated and imperfectly represented.

   Although the passage from the lowermost Rhaetic beds into the Keuper Marls is

very gi-adual, there are clear indications of a pause or break in the deposition of the
beds forming the two overlying subdi\ isions, in the signs of erosion sometimes

shown in the upper sm-faces of the hard bands of limestones containing Pecten
valoniensis, and commonly in that of the Gotham marble. The proofs are still
stronger in the beds of " White Lias," which not onlj^ aSbrd unmistakeable evidence
of having suffered erosion since their deposition and prior to that of the superim-
posed Lias, but also of having been penetrated by boring mollusca, the cavities
made by which are in many cases still remaining.

   The palseontological evidence on this point tends equally to show that there is
nothing in common between the fossils of the uppermost Rhsetic beds and those of
the overlying liassic strata; tlie former consisting of Modiola minima, Ptdlastra
arenicola, Axinns, &c., the latter of Ammonites planorhis, at Watchett, and at
Penarth of that shell together with immense numbers of Ostrea liassica in a re-

markable state of preservation.

    In conclusion, Mr. Bristow stated that, it being desirable that the Rhsetic beds
of this country should be distingiiished in the maps of the Geological Survey by a
synonym derived from a British locality where these beds are well displayed and
fully developed, he was induced, at the suggestion of the Director-General Sii- Ro-

derick Mm-chison, to propose Penarth as a good typical name, in preference to many
others which had been recommended, but which were for several reasons objec^

tionable.

                                                                                                        4*

   The teim Penarth, to which no such objections would apply, is, besides, particu-
larly appropriate, inasmuch as the beds in question are clearly exposed in the sea-
clifls of that and the adjacent headlands in a southerly direction, where (as well as
in the railway-cuttings in connexion with the large and important docks now in
course of construction) they are seen to attain a thickness of nearly 100 feet, rest-
ing upon the red marls of the Keuper, and capped by the lower lias, in which the

fossils are altogether diffei-ent.

Remarhs on two outliers of Lias in South Warwickshire, and on the presence

    of the Rhcetic Bone-heel at Knoivle, its furthest northern extension hitherto

   recognized in that County. By the Rev. P. B. Bkodie, M.A., F.G.S.

   The Liassic outlier at luiowle was first described, and was shown to be of limited
extent, and to consist of limestones and shales belonging to the zone of Ammonites
planorhis, and equivalent to the Saurian beds, as seen at Brockeridge Common, near
Tewkesbury. Lower beds, however, crop out near the canal, where dark laminated
shales may be observed resting upon the Red Marl, and amongst them fi'agments of
a yellow micaceous sandstone containing Pidlastra arenicola, a shell which always
occiu'S low down in the series, in close connexion with the bone-bed, and seems to
have a very limited range. The section is very obscm-e, so that it was impossible
to say whether any true bone-bed actually existed in situ ; but the position of the
dark shales, and the presence of a band of sandstone always associated with it, marks
the existence of the Rhietic series at this spot, and not hitherto observed there.
The larger outlier at Wootton Park was described, where similar beds may be traced,
from the Pecten-valoniensis bed up to the Lima beds, with the usual characteristic
fossils, including Estheria and Kaiadita in the Estheria bed. Elsewhere insect
limestone was observed unusually rich in wings and elytra of insects. This outlier
is traversed by a line of fault running from N.W. to S.E. These two remnants of
the Lias are the extreme limit of that foi-mation in Warwickshire in a noi"therly
direction, and no trace of it appears again nearer than the outlier in North Staflbrd-
shire, where Mr. Howell, of the Geological Survey, detected the yellow sandstone
and black Rhretic shales above referred to, which seems to be their extreme

northern limit.

of ancient British species now living in the North Pacific. Many of these are sub-

in Vancouver and California. The list of species will be found in Reports, 1863,

On the Cause of the Extrication of Carbonic Acid from the Intenor of the
    Earth, and on its Chemical Action upon the Constituents of Felspathic

    Rocks. By'DT.'DAVBBy^,F.R.S., F.G.S.
   The author made some comments upon a theoiy advanced by Prof Bischoff", of
Bonn, in his work entitled " Elements of Chemical and Physical Geology," in
which the elevation and dislocation of certain rocks were attributed to the decom-
position of felspar, through the agency of the carbonic acid disengaged from the
                                                               --

interior of the eartli, seeing that the products of the decomposition of gi-anite are
found to possess a lower specific gravity, and therefore occupy more space, than
the original materials of the rock. Such a change would, doubtless, occur in gra-
nite and trap, if acted upon by carbonic acid at temperatures below 212° ; but above
that point the A'ery opposite would be observed, inasmuch as the silicic woidd then
take the place of the carbonic acid, and consequently, if brought into contact with
earthy or alkaline carbonates in the interior of the earth, would produce silicates

and expel carbonic acid, as, indeed, was long ago pointed out bj^ the author of this
paper in his work on Volcanos, and is insisted upon by Prof BischofF himself in
other parts of his volume. It seems difficult, therefore, to attach much importance
to the cause assigned by Prof Bischoff for the elevation of strata, especially con-
sidering that the loss of substance incurred by the rock, through the removal of its
alkali by the agency of carbonic acid, would go far towards counterbalancing any
expansion due to the lower specific gravity' of the kaolin resulting, and moreover
recollecting that no theory which professes to account for the elevation of certain
portions of the earth's sm-fece ought to be accepted if it does not embrace likewise
the coiTesponding phenomenon oi the sinking or depression of others.

On the Lower Silurian Eocl-s of the South-East of Cumberland and the North-
       East of Westmoreland. By Professor Haekness, F.B.S., F.G.S.

   The district to which this commimication has reference is an area in Cumber-
land and Westmoreland, about 15 miles in a N.N.W. and S.S.E. direction, along
the western margin of the Pennine escai-pmeut. Its breadth does not exceed 1^
mile, and in one locality it becomes a very narrow band. Its eastern boundary
consists of the upper Old Red Sandstone and the succeeding carboniferous rocks
rocks of the same age also, in part, form its western border ; but the south-west
portion of the district has, as a margin, the upper Permian sandstones, from which
the Lower Silurian rocks are separated by the gTeat Pennine Fault.

   The contour of the Lower Silm-ian rocks of the S.E. of Cumberland and the N.E.
of "Westmoreland is widely different from that of the strata which border them.
54 EEPORT--1864.

This consists of a series of conical hills, the outline of which is well marked in the
Pikes of Knock, Dufton, and Murton. The rocks which make up the Lower Silu-
rians in this portion of the North of England consist of sedimentary strata having
the mineral nature and fossils of the Skiddaw slate series of the Lake country ; ami
of these there are several anticlinal axes exposed. To the Skiddaw slates succeed
greenstones, porphyries, and ash-beds, of great thickness ; and these are the equi-
valents of rocks of the same natm'e which, in the Lake district, overlie the Skiddaw

slates.

In the upper portion of this series, in the neighbourhood of Dufton, there is a

considerable development of dark-coloured Haggy slates, and these abound in

fossils ; the most abundant being Trimicleus conceutricus, Cali/mene Blumenhachii,

Beijrichia struiiffidata, Leptcena sericea, and Stenopora Jihrosa. These fossiliferous
flaggy slates are succeeded by poi-phyi-ies and ash-beds having upon them a lime-

stone, which is worked near Keisley.

The mineral nature of this limestone shows it to possess a great affinity to the Bala

         or its northern  equivalent, the Coniston  limestone                                        and      is also very
--limestone,                                                                                      ;       it

nearly allied to the Irisli type of this series that of the Chair of Kildare. Fossils

are seen abimdantly in this limestone of Keisley after it has weathered, and these

fossils, of which about twenty-eight species occur, still further connect the Keisley

limestone with the Bala or Coniston portion of the Caradoc group.

Immediately south of Keisley, a great fault brings the Skiddaw slates in contact

with the representative of the Bala limestone. This fault, which has a down-

throw towards the N.N.W., must be at least 10,000 feet in extent, as no portion

of the greenstones, porphyries, ash-beds, or the intercalated fossiliferous flaggy

shales which intervene between the Skiddaw slates and the Keisley limestone, is

here seen.

   The Skiddaw slates brought in by this fault, on its S.S.E. side, form the Lower
Silurian area south of Keisley ; and in this portion of the district the dip of the
strata is eutu-ely reversed, being N.N.W.

   This Skiddaw slate, south of Keisley, forms Mm'ton Pike, the highest of the
conical hills in the area under consideration.

   Besides the great fault, which brings in contact the Keisley limestone and the
Skiddaw slates, and which is of an ancient date, as it does not affect the Old Bed
Sandstones or carboniferous strata imder which it passes eastwards, there is an-
other fault of a newer age having a N.N.W. and S.S.E. course, or being parallel to
the great Pennine Fault. This latter fault has cut through the carboniferous rocks
and their supporting Old Red Sandstones ; and on the west of the Pennine chain,

bordering tlie more northern portion of the Lower Silurian rocks, we have a de-
tached area of Old Red Sandstones and the succeeding carboniferous series, the

result of this fault, lying on its west side, and separated from the great mass of the

Dr. Hector briefly described the geology of the Province of Otago.

yond a great valley, grey and blue gold-bearing schists form a wide flattened boss,
and are seen to throw off the hornblendic slates and sandstones to the west, and

     On the Possible Conditions of Geological Climate.

     Bii Professor Hejo^esst, F.R.S., M.B.I.A.

   It appeared to the author that we have now attained to a sufficiently complete

knowledge of the causes which atiect the earth's existing climate to attempt the

investigation of the climatic condition of ditferent geological epochs, with a view

of arriving at results capable of being verified by the fiicts accumulated by geolo-

gical observers. The principal active conditions upon which climate depends are

(1) the temperature of^space and the intiuence of stellar irradiation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         (2j the  sun's

intensity and the earth's position in its orbit; (.3) the amount of heat gained by

the superficial parts of the earth from its interior. The secondaiy conditions of

climate are the absorbing, radiating, and conducting powers of the matter com-

posing the earth's exterior coating, as well as the state of consistence in the solid

or fluid form of the several parts of this coating. The author referred to the

possible variations of the fii-st primary source of heat as suggested by Poisson

namely, that the temperature of space may be variable, and thus that the earth,
moving with the sim and the rest of our sj'stem, might be alternately warmed and

cooled by passing, after the lapse of ages, through regions of space with very dif-

ferent thermal conditions. He had already criticized this speculation at the
Meeting of the Association in Manchester in 1861, when it had been referred to as
a possible agent of geological change by Professor W. Thomson. The author

pointed out that no evidence could be presented of variations of temperature in

space, except those which may result fi-om varying radiation. If the stars are

heat-giving as well as luminous, they radiate heat to smTOundiug bodies inversely
as the squares of their distances. The correspondence between this law and the law
of gravitation would lead to the inference that our sim could not approach so close

to another star as to intiuence teiTestrial climate to the large extent required by
many geological phenomena without producing a permanent connexion between
the two Sims, so that the double system would become, in fact, a double star.

This objection coidd not be met, and it has been since reproduced by a recent
writer in the pages of one of our scientific periodicals. The researches of chemists
and physicists into the physical constitution of the sun present grounds for believ-

ing that the sun's intensity may possibly be a variable quantity. The ingenious

speculation of Mayer, by which the sun's heat ia attempted to be explamed on

thermodynamical pruiciples, deserves notice, because it has been appealed to in
order to fui'nish some presumption of past variations in solar intensity. The sun,
accQvding to this theory, is fed, and has been nom'ished for ages, by mjTiads of

aerolites, such as we know to exist in space. It has been shown that the fall of a
single aerolite on the sim would produce by its percussion a calorific effect so
enormous that we may readily admit the efficiency of the cause, provided the
asteroids are supplied to the sun in large quantities. But how does this theory, if
true, tend to explain the past conditions of terrestrial temperature ? The sun, on this

hypothesis, draws to it, by the attraction of its overpowering mass, midtitudes of

those small planetary bodies which faU in smaller quantities upon the earth. The

suu's mass, volume, and surface have, therefore, probably been on the increase
since verj' remote epochs. The dynamical heat-producing energy of the sun, as
well as its heat-radiating sm-face, would follow a correspondiug law of increase.
Thu^ it woidd seem to follow that the sun's intensity should, upon the whole, be
greater at recent than at remote geological epochs. The growing mas3 of the sun

would also slightly tend to shorten the earth's mean distance, and therefore to add
--56 REPOKT 1864.

to its temperature. Such results do uot agree witli the general mass of facts

presented by geological inquiries, and we have, moreover, no geological evidence
of the past existence of considerable gi'oups of fossil aerolites. Had such bodies
fallen upon the sun during its passage through space in much gi-eater quantities

formerly than now, we should expect to find some corresponding accimiulations in

the stratified deposits which form the outer crust of the sim's satellite, our eaiih ;

and their apparent absence shows that it is scarcely safe to use Mayer's theory for

explaining such climatic changes as those under consideration. The varying

position of the earth in its orbit around the sun was then referred to ; and the

author concludes that, in the present state of the question, our only reliable

evidence is negative, or, in other words, the variations in the earth's position in

its orbit are not proved to be sufficient to account for great changes in its climate.

The author referred briefly to the proofs of the stability of the axis of rotation of
the earth as eliminating a possible cause of changes of climate, and to the commu-

nications he published on the subject in the Proceedings of the Royal Society fir

1852, and in the ' Athenaeum ' for September 1860. On the last occasion the same

subject was treated by the Astronomer Royal, and with precisely the same results

as those previously established by the author. The modes of accounting for the

obseBved increase of heat in approaching the earth's interior imply a different

order of increase or decrease of its influence during former geological epochs. The

hypothesis of an incandescent nucleus of fused matter contained in a shell whicli

had solidified from the fluid has been objected to on various gxounds. These

objections, when fully examined, tend to confirm the probable truth of the hypo-

thesis. Thus, in 1857, Mr. Hopkins communicated to the Association an account

of his experiments on the conductive powers of different rocks. He also compared

the conductivities so foimd \\'ith the rate of increase of temperature in descending

mines excavated out of rocks such as had been made the subject of experiment.

It seemed to follow that no connexion was traceable between the increase of

interior temperature and the conducting-power of different parts of the earth's crust.

The conclusion was hence dravra that the supposition of a cooling central mass of

matter in the earth was inconsistent with observation. The author now ventures

to reproduce the remarks he then made on Mr. Hopkins's comjuunication, as these

remarks have never hitherto appeared in a printed form.

The author described the discontinuous and broken structure of the greater part

of the rock-formations constituting the earth's crust. The propagation of heat

throughout such a mass could not follow the same simple laws as in a continuous

unbroken homogeneous solid. He showed that the rate of transmission of heat
would be much slower than even the extremely slow rate assigned by mathematical

analysis to a continuous mass. The amoimt of heat passing outwardly to the earth's

surface through the dry rocks and soil would thus be generally so small as to pos-

sess no geological importance. By studying the actual conditions of the interior
rocky masses rendered accessible by mines, we shall arrive at more valuable and

trustworthy conclusions relative to terrestrial heat. The mines from which most of

our facts regarding interior temperatm'e have been collected are provided with exten-

sive hydraulic apparatus for draining off the rapidly accumulating water. Many of

our facts have been deduced from observing the temperature of artesian wells bored

through water-bearing strata. Thermal springs, like those of Bath, would imdoubt-

edly arise wherever we could bore downwards to similar depths. The constant per-

colation of superficial moisture tends to saturate the joints and fissures among the

lower rocky beds as well as the more porous and permeable overlying strata. In

limited masses of liquid, heat is propagated upwards, not by conduction, but by the

far more energetic process of convection ; and thus, while each piece of rock is

bathed by water, it acquires a different temperature from what it would possess

Weunder the imaginary conditions of continuity and drj'ness.  should thus be led

to expect no kind of definite connexion between the rate of increase of temperature

and the conducting properties of the dry stone, although we might fauly expect to

trace such a connexion between the permeability of rocks to moisture and the

Adistribution of temperature in borings made through great depths.  consequence

of primary geological importance appears to the author to be deducible from these

considerations. The consequence alluded to is deduced from the probable past

 condition of the earth's crust, as infeiTed not only from the hypothesis of its con-

 solidation from a fused nucleus, but from the acc-uniulated facts of recent inquiries
 into the chemical and physical structure of rocks. The former condition of the

 solid shell should have been highly fa\ourable to interchanges of heat between
 the earth's watery coating and its interior, while chemical geology seems to estab-

 lish that multitudes of mineral products, previously supposed to be the results of
 dry fusion and solidification, have been really formed under conditions where both
 heat and water were abundantly present. Metamorphic actions especially, as

 alluded to by Sir Charles Lyell, have been sho-uTi to have been produced on a

 vast scale by the infiltration of water. The influence which water may have thus

 exercised as a heat-carrier is declared by Professor Hennessy to have been so

 great, that the effects of conduction through the crust considered as a dry solid

 may be regarded as comparatively insignificant. The author fm-ther considers
 how his views regarding h3'drothermal action in the earth's crust would accelerate

 the cooling of the supposed interior source of heat, and he comes to the conclusion

 that this would take place much more rapidly than we have been hitherto led to
 believe from the calculations of mathematicians who considered only the unreal
 case of a dry continuous solid. He also points out that lij'drothermal action,

 imlike mere conduction, might be intermittent in its energy, while the efforts of
 the latter must diminish continuously.

    The remainder of the paper is occupied with a discussion of the relative in-

 fluences of air, earth, and water on the reception, retention, and distribution of
 heat coming from exterior and interior sources. The author adduces further proofs
 of the conclusions to which he was led in his essay on the influence of the distri-

 bution of land and water on terrestrial temperature during different geological

 epochs, of which an outHne had been communicated to the dissociation in 1856,

 although the paper itself did not appear in a complete fonn until three years sub-
 sequently*. One of these conclusions was subsequently adopted by Professor

Phillips, and this is now further extended by the autbor. It appears to him that

 the distribution of land and water most favourable, upon the whole, to a general
augmentation of terrestrial temperature arising from all possible primary sources,
is that of a water-covered spheroid, with numerous small islands scattered over its
surface. The physical conditions originatino- a low temperature are also examined,
and finally the circumstances most favourable to the presence, at the same epoch

of time, of opposite, contiguous, and simultaneous chmatic conditions. Among

other questions, the influence of diy and moist thei-mal currents of air upon snow
and ice was discussed from considerations depending on the capacity of air and
vapour for heat. From these considerations it follows that, while cold moist air

favours the formation of snow and glaciers, warm moist air is highly favourable to

their destruction compared with dry air at the same temperatiu'e.
   The author has thus been led to adopt views as to the possible formation and

development of glaciers at former epochs apparently in harmony with some of the
conclusions of Charpentier, Tyndall, and Franklan'd. It seems to foUow from the
views developed by the author that epoclis characterized by the simultaneous co-
existence of very different climatic conditions over diflerent regions would depend
upon variations in the distribution of land and water, combined with obstructions
of the hydrothermal agency, whereby the surface of the earth receives heat froiu
its interior. Geological observation seems to point out that such conditions woulil
be most likely to arise during the later and prehistoric formations, as well as durinu-
the period of the physical history of the planet which now witnesses the develoj -
ment of oiu" own race.

         On the Species of the Genus Pteraspis. By E. R. Lankestek.

   In this paper the author first reviewed the present state of our knowledge of

those remarkable fossils of the Old Red Sandstone, the Cephalaspis and Pteraspis,
which he stated was in a very imsatisfactory condition. Cephalaxpis had been
taken in hand by Sir Philip Egerton, but Pteraspis was in a state of complete con-
fusion. His friend Prof. Huxley had intended to work at the latter genus, and had
made drawings and notes for the pm-pose, but had finally relinquished his inten-
tion, and handed his material very kindly to the author. From this and other
material at his disposal, the author was enabled to establish three genera, Pferas^ns,

Cyathaspis, Scaphaspis, in place of the one Pteraspis. In the first, the shield con-

sists of seven separable pieces ; it includes Pi!, rosfratus, Ag., Pt. Crouchii, Salter.

In the second genus, Cyathaspis, the head-plate is separable into four pieces only

it contains Cyatliai^pis Banksii, and a new species, Cy. Symondsii. The last genus

is characterized by the shield being composed of one simple, oval, indivisible plate.

Scaphaspis includes Sc. Llitydii, Sc. Lewisii, Sc. truncatus, and Sc. ludensis.

The post-tertiary beds in the north-east of Yorkshire exhibit distinct traces of

glacial action. At Scarborough they attain a thickness of rather more than 200

feet. The fossils collected in the boulder-clay at that place by the author, and in

the sapie material at Whitby, by Mr. Jefti-eys, represented thirteen species. All

of them are marine ; they inhabit high latitudes, and (with two exceptions, viz.
MyaAstarte horealis and Tellina calcaria) also the British seas.

On the New South Wales Coal Field. By J. MACEJiirziE.

    Oh the Geology of the South -West of England. By C. Mooee, F.G.S.

   The author pointed out certain physical featui-es which led him to the conclu-

sion that the Mendip Hills had performed an important part in modiij-ing the phy-
sical geology of the West of England, and that it was probable that that range of

hills had proved a barrier to the incursion of the Secondary seas which washed theh"

southern slopes. He then observed that, whilst the Secondary rocks outside the

coal-basin were generally deposited couformabh', those on the outer edge, and

within the Somersetshu-e coal-basin, afforded evidences of general unconformability,

and were found under very abnormal conditions, his view being that the Mendips

were at times only so far depressed as to admit of occasional irruptions of the sea

within the coal-basin, the thick deposits of the New Red Sandstone and the Rhfetic

and Liassic seas being very thinly represented therein. The Rhajtic beds were
proposed by Mr. Moore for a group of rocks intermediate between the Lias and the
Trias. Though thinly represented in this country as compared with the Continental

beds, they were shown to be of great interest in a palaeontological point of view.
Mr. Moore described the contents of three cartloads of deposit of this age he had
found washed into a fissure of carboniferous limestone near Frome. From this he

--exhibited twenty-niue teeth of the oldest mammals, three only having been pre-

%-iously found together with nine genera of reptiles, most of" them new to this

coimtry, and fifteen genera of fishes. Mr. Moore produced to the Meeting 70,000
teeth of the Lophodus alone as the result of his labour, and stated that the three

loads of clay had j)robably yielded him one million specimens. He then refen-ed

to the ironstone of the Middle Lias in the North of England, and remarked that

one landed proprietor alone possessed there a quantity which, it had been calculated,
when converted into iron and sold at the present price of iron, woidd bring in
money enough to pay off the national debt. The same beds, he remarked, occun-ed
around Bath and in the West of England ; but, from their not containing quite so

much ii-on, and fi-om their being thinner, the fair city of the West would be spared

the mortification of finding blast furnaces springing up aroimd. Passing to the
Upper Lias, the author described a very remarkable bed containing insects, fi-uits,

Crustacea, fishes, and reptilia. In doing this he produced a number of nodular
stones, and was enabled to say that one contained the tail of a Pachi/cormtis, that a
second contained a head of the same fish, a third a perfect fish, whilst another held
in its stony enibrace a cuttle-fish, which it was prophesied would contain the cut-
tle-bone and ink-bag. Mr. Moore proceeded to open them, when the fish he had
previously indicated was discovered ; and the most interesting specimen was that

which contained the cuttle-fish. When Mr. Moore broke open the stone, not only

was the cuttle-fish visible, but the inky fluid (the sepia) was discovered, as in a
fish of the same kind that might be taken out of tlie sea at the present day. There

was as much of it as woidd fill an ordinary-sized ink-bottle. He then' produced

some very perfect specimens of the Ichthyosauri found in the neighbourhood of
Bath, and a specimen of a fish, about the size of a salmon, of six or seven pounds
weight. It was so perfect in its form and appearance and shape that, but for its
colour, as Mr. Moore said, it might be handed by mistake to the cook to dress
and yet millions and millions of years must have elapsed since this fish lived and

moved about in the water. In the mammal di-ift, which entirely sun-oimded Bath,
the remains of extinct mammalia were abundant, and Mr. Moore exhibited many

specimens.

      Traces of Glacial Drift in the Shetland Islands. By C. W. Peach.

  Having last summer accepted the kind invitation of Mr. .1. Gwjn Jefli'eys to be

his guest on a dredgimr expedition to these northern isles, I was induced, by a re-
quest from Sir R. I. Murchison, to look out for traces of glacial action there. The

result of my observations I liave thought right to lay before the British Associa-

tion, apologizing- for the meagre story I have to tell. This poverty arises partly

from my resolve to devote all the time possible to zoological work, and partly from

the very small portion of the islands visited. Our first landing was at Lerwick,

where little time was spent, either then or when returning. In a short walk that

I took in the immediate vicinity of the town, at the Bay of Sclate, I found the

sandstone on the top of  the  clitf deeply  rutted,  striated,  and  polished                                   and a little
                                                                                                             ;

inland, on the side of the famed Loch of Clickamin, similar markings. These

markings are again to be seen on the opposite side of this bay. The ruts, &c. are

all in a north and south direction, with slight deviations to the east and west. The
direction the drift came from is e-\ idently northerly, and may be traced up the

valley, as shown by the wide-spread ruin and large blocks scattered all over it,

resting on striated and polished rocks. The hills on each side of this valley and

those at the head beyond the docks bear unmistakeable evidence also of gi-inding

and polishing. After leaving Lerwick the Out-Skerries of Whalsey became our

home. The three small islands forming this group lie far out in the sea ; they are

called Gruna, Bruray, and Housay. There is an excellent harbour here, having

two good entrances for vessels and boats, and a third into which boats can run

when the tide answers. These entrances are triradiate, the harbour being in the

centre, sheltered by the three islands from every wind. They have been the scene

--of great grinding, all being more or less rounded, roches-vioutonnees form of

knolls being abundant, whether composed of granite, gneiss, quartz, or limestone,

all these being intermingled throughout the group. Although much corroded by
atmospheric action, and the limestone much more acted on by sea-water, the

roundmg can be everywhere seen. By these agents the ruts, striae, &c. are thus

generally obliterated, and they are also further obscured by an overgrowth of

lichen. I Avas fortimate enough to find a recently-bared rock near the Mill Cove

on the island of Housay, from which I further removed the drift and washed the

stone, and here ruts, striae, &.nii polishing could be as plainly seen as if just done.

I also foimd on the highest part of this island, on a gneiss rock, some deep ruts and

scratches, which, with those at the Mill Cove, ran nearly E. and W., this being the

direction of the channel of the two principal entrances to the harbour which sepa-

rates Gruna from Bruray. The clitf on the north side of the Mill Cove of Housay

is about 200 feet high ; the sea breaks on the top of it in heavy gales, and tears

up the rock, and also throws up material from the deep. So great is the force, that

large blocks are driven far back, a considerable distance from the edge of the clift",

into a semicircular-like wall. Between this wall and the clift' a deep river-like

gully is scooped out, down which the water rushes again to the sea, at a great dis-

tance from the spot whence it was thrown up. The water left in depressions in this

grdly is brackish, and in it Enteromorpha grows. Mr. Jefii-eys and myself gathered

portions of limpets, mussels, periwinkles, rock whelks, and other sea shells, amongst

the sand and gravel, both in and on the edge of this gully. The whole of the top

of this cliff (much of it is now beyond the mfluence of the seas of the present day)

is also strewn yn\.h. proofs of similar action, some of the stones hanging in ridges

on the rounded sides of the hill. All these loose blocks and stones rest on rormded

--knolls and polished rock all so polished before the burthen they now bear was

thrown on them. Although I know of many gi-and instances of such recent ruin

both in Caithness and Orkney, this far exceeds them all. Every season the terrific

seas which break on the whole of these islands, leave traces of their power of the

most astonishing kind. As well as the markings on the rocks, I met with several

deposits of drifted matter, in which rounded, striated, and smoothed stones were

not vmcommon. Some of these deposits were from 12 to 14 feet in depth.

Perched blocks, but not in abundance, some of large size, were scattered over the

whole group. Our next move was to North Unst, Baltasound being our head-

quarters. Here too the eft'ect of glacial action was plainly to be seen. The ser-

pentine rock had suffered seriously, and although much acted on by weather, the

rounded outline of the hills and knolls teUs clearly of the grinding they had been

mysubjected to. Ruts and stricB are also rare here. They, however, fell tu:der

notice on the clitf' at Hagdale in Haroldswick Bay, on a recently bared rock un-

derlying a thick deposit of drift, in which rounded and striated stones and blocks
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  61

were plentiful. The whole of the rubbed serpentine enclosed in the drift shows

small pieces of chromate of iron standing up beyond the matrix, proving that this

mineral is very generally diffused throughout the whole of the serpentine of Unst.

The direction of the ruts, &c. is nearly W.N.W. and E.S.E. The hills of the

Muckle and Little Heogs lie to the north of this spot (Hagdale), and a slope, from
about 20 feet above the level of the sea, rises gradually hence to the top of tlie
Muckle Heog to the height of at least 500 feet. In this slope lies the famed

chromate-of-iron mine. On reaching the top of this hill I found the W.N.W. end

vertical and polished to the depth of at least 150 feet. The hill to the north of
this slopes towards it. This stortn side had evidently resisted a portion of the de-

stroying force, and turned it on its western flank, and thus it swept down the valley
towards Haroldswick Bay, evidenced by the greater destruction there than on the

eastern side towards Baltasound. This is a fine instance of crag and tail, the north

end of the Muckle Heog being the crag, the south with the Little Heog forming
the tail. The scene from the top of the Muckle Heog, when looking towards
Haroldswick, and then in the direction of Bm-rafiord, is one that tells of mighty

--agency long continued, powerful to crush and grind so powerful that the really

hard and massive hills of serpentine have been ploughed down and removed to
below the sea-level in places near Haroldswick, the sea having since pUed up a
beach on these spots, through which the water percolates from the low peaty soil
formed at the back at each recession of the tide. All over Unst the rocks show
traces of abrasion, and in many places deposits of drift, enclosing stones of all
sizes, some of which are roimded and striated. I mention a few of these spots
where I got drift, so that any one desirous may see them. First, Hagdale, at
Hammer, on the side of Baltasound. The haunted burn of Watlea, between Balta-
sound and Ueay Sound, and at the latter place on the sea-shore. On the south side
of the Island of Ueay a similar deposit imderlies a sandy raised beach, which
encloses pebbles, whelks, oysters, and other sea-shells, as well as fish-bones, in
abimdance. Large perched blocks (some many tons in weight) lie scattered

about everywhere. In none of the glacial deposits did I find a single organism.

   Thus, then, at both ends and the middle of this interesting group of islands

traces of glacial action have been found. I must, however, leave the filling up of
the interspaces to others. I feel certain that, from the appearance of the islands

as we coasted along them, the whole have been visited by similar action.

             Additional List of Fossils from the Boidder-clai/ of CaitJiness,

                                   %C.AV. Peach.

    In 1862, at Cambridge, I had the pleasure of reading to this Section a list of
fossils found in the Boulder-clay of Caithness. In consequence of the interest which
it excited, I have since paid greater attention to this deposit and its organisms, and

have been ably assisted by my friend Mr. Joseph Anderson of this place (who is

also a hard worker in the Old Red Sandstone), and Mr. J. Miller Sutherland, of
Lybster. These gentlemen have kindly brought all their gatherings to me for ex-

amination, and thus I find that they have also got nearly the whole of the organisms
mentioned in both lists. Mr. Sutherland has found one shell and Mr. Anderson two,
which have not occun'ed to me.

   The Foraminifera, mentioned at the bottom of the list, were named by Messrs.
Jefireys and Waller, both excellent authorities. They were taken by me out of a
veiy small nest of sand enclosed in the clay of the Burn of Haster. With these
were portions of minute shells, and plates and spines of Echinoderms, and spicula
of Sponges. Mr. Anderson has since obtained a gi-eat many Foraminifera, Ento-
mostraca, &c., by washing the Boulder-clay itself, probably as many as ten or
twelve genera. These all require careful examination by those conversant with
such minute and difficidt forms before they can be made use of. Mr. Jefireys had
suggested to me that very delicate organisms might be got by washing the' Boul-
der-clay, but I thought it too hard and obstinate, so that to Mr. Anderson is the
credit due of first proving Mr. Jeffreys's suggestion correct, although he had never
heardof it. This washing test, if applied to deposits of clay apparently destitute of
organisms, may lead to interesting results. Mr. Anderson and mvself have washed
-- --;

clays from many localities, extending from near Jolin O'Groats to beyond Wick,

and all the samples tried have yielded more or fewer Foraminifera, Entomostraca,

i&c, from whatever part of the deposits the clay has been taken.

  In my last paper I stated that in no case had I found two valves of a shell united

in the clay. I have since got an Anomia vrith both valves in place, and in a beau-

tiful state of preservation. It occurred in Boulder-clay containing the usual rubbed

stones and broken shells. Mr. Anderson has a piece of shell, on which is a cluster
of young Balani in excellent preservation. Such instances are so rare that I think
them worthy of notice.

   I may mention that, when dredging this summer with Mr. Jeffi-eys off Shetland,
I was much struck -with the fossil shells brought up at almost every haul, all so
much like, in fact identical with, those found in the Boulder-clay of Caithness

and although some were broken, for instance, Cyprina islandica, the only difference

that I could perceive in their appearance and preservation was that the dredged

shells generally were more perfect than those in the clay. The fi'agmentary state
of the claj' shells, I believe, was caused by the rough treatment they had expe-
rienced in being removed fi'om the original deposit in which many of them had
been imbedded, and which was subsequently broken up before being removed to
and lodged in the formation that now overlies the Caithness flags.

    I tliiuk it right to mention that Mr. J. Cleghorn of Wick, and Mr. Dick of Thurso,

were the first local geologists who found and made public the fact that this fonna-
tion was fossiliferous-- a fact previouslv doubted. I am again indebted to Mr. J.
G-wyn Jefii-eys for his kindness in naming the Mollusca and Cirripedia. For the
rest I am answerable.

On an Accumulation of Shells, luitJi Human Industrial Remains, found on a
hill near the River Teign, in Devonshire. ByW. Pengellt, F.R.S., F.G.S.

In this paper the author described a lai-ge accumulation of shells, all of them

such as were derivable from the estuary of the Teign, which had been found in a

ti'ench rudely but distinctly cut in the New Red Conglomerate at Rocombe, in the

Aparish of Stokeiuteignhead, about four miles from Torquay.  considerable amount

of broken pottery of coai'se character, a brass armlet, a bone hair-pin, and a portion

of a quern, all of Anglo-Roman age, were mingled with the shells.

On Changes of Relative Level of Land and Sea in South-Eastern Devonshire,
   in Conneccion tvith the Antiquity of Mankind. By W. Pengellt, F.R.S.^

    F.G.S.

   In this communication the author, having briefly noticed the characteristics of
the existing general coast-line, described a series of phenomena which indicate that

within what is known as the Quaternary Period, the whole of south-eastern Devon-
shire was at least 280 feet lower than at present ; that by a series of slow and gradual
upheavals, separated by protracted periods of intermittence, it was raised at least
40 feet above its present level ; that these elevatory movements were followed by
one of subsidence ; that since the last adjustment of relative level, the waves have
cut back the cliffs so as to form the existing strand, which in some instances is
nearly half a mile in width. Having discussed the relative chronology of the facts
described, he showed that the Mammoth existed in Devonshire so late* as the era of
the submerged forests of Torbay ; and that this period had not closed before the
advent of man in the same locality. Lastly, he produced a flint implement found
in a patch of gravel on Windmill Hill, Brixham, and which, from its situation and
character, must be of an antiquity greater than that of the submerged forests, or

raised beaches, or ossiferous caverns, or even the Betula nana clays of the district.

                  On the Formation of Valleys near KirJchi/ Lonsdale.

                 By Prof. Phillips, M.A., LL.D., F.B.S., F.G.S.

   The author called the attention of geologists engaged in considering the theory

of the origin of valleys to the necessity of keeping in view not only all the real
causes which have been concerned in changing the level and modifying the surface
of the solid land, but also the peculiarities of the rocks themselves in regard to the
resistance they might offer to the waste occasioned by the mechanical and chemical

agencies of water. He proposed to show, in regard to certain great ridges and hol-

lows which limited the drainage of the Lime and its branches, that these were
plainly sketched out by ancient subterranean movements that, in regard to par-

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

ticular streams, as the Lune and the Rother, there must have been valleys on part
of their course before the age of the Old Red Sandstone ; and that the courses of
others, as Leek Beck and Barbon Beck, were marked out by great faults ; while

otliers, not in directions of sucli faults, were yet traceable to lines of weakness in
rocks occasioned by joints, having a determinate relation to these fractures. The
conclusion from the whole being that the main featiu-es of the inequalities of the

earth's surface were always referable to displacements of the rocks and_ lines of
weakness dependent on them ; and that the agencies of waste along their directions
were ancient operations of the sea, at the rising and faUinp; of the level of the land,
and other operations sometimes very ancient, but often still in force, depending on
atmospheric vicissitudes. In reference to this latter operation the author gave
proof from the upper part of Leek Beck that the narrow rocky limestone glen
which runs up toward the " County stone " is nothing else than a line of ancient
subterranean caverns, of which the roofs have fallen in, and that this process is still
in progress, the water being received in swallows at higher levels on the slope of
the moors, and employed in dissolving the calcareous rocks on its passage. Thus

the valley in question, and many others similarly situated, were not excavated from
the sui'face, but, after long ages of underground action of water, were formed by the

falling in of the unsupported roofs. After this had occurred the usual surface

action of running water had modified the sides and the slopes of the bed.

           On the Measure of Geological Time by Natural Chronometers.
                 By Prof. Phillips, M.A., LL.D., F.E.S., F.G.S.

   Distinguishing, in the first place, between the history of operations in the sea
and on the land, by which the succession of ancient phenomena is determined,
from the attempts to .ascertain, first the relative, and finally the absolute chronology

of these events, the author noticed several orders of natural effects which, being
traceable through the later geological periods, and still in progress, seemed the tit-
test to be employed in tlie measure of Cfenozoic time. Examples are found in the

action of streams wearing away their channels, or depositing sediment ; in the
formation and growth of peat moor ; in the filling up of lakes ; and, finally, in
the accumidation of detritus in conical mounds at the foot of precipices by falling
of rocks or toi-rents of water. The last case was illustrated by drawings, and a
description of the remarkable moimds of La Tiniere on the Lake of Geneva, near
VUleneuve, which had been investigated by M. Morlot. At this place one of the
mounds, the least ancient, has been cut through by the railway to a depth of be-
tween 20 and 30 feet. The section exposes the materials usually found in such
mounds (large and small pebbles and sand) ; but, in addition, three bands of loamy

matter, 6 to 8 inches thick, are seen to range parallel to the general surface, one,
4 feet below the surface, another, 10 feet, the third 19 feet. The bands contain

charcoal, and have rather the aspect of vegetable earth, in part stained yellow.

--With the upper one were found Roman reliquiie fragments of tiles and a coin

the middle one yielded no such objects, but some bronze fabrications; the lower

one, coarse potter)', also fragments of bones of men and animals. Prof. Phillips
was so fortunate as to obtain from this lowest band, by his own research, a portion
of cranial bone, which, by the help of Mr. C. Robertson of the Oxford Museum, he
finds to be, as he had conjectured, part of the occipital bone of man. From these
facts M. Morlot infeiTcd that at three successive epochs the action of the toi-rent
spread the reliquiai of human occupation over the growing delta of La Tiniere
that the epochs may be approxunately calculated at 1600, -3800, and 6400 years ago.
And he refers these dates to particular points in the "Roman," "bronze," and
"stone" periods; so that the earliest trace of man in this delta is between 6000
and 7000 years old. No stone implements occurred in this mound. The age of the
whole mound is estimated at 10,000 years. M. Morlot also applied the same me-
thod of computation to the earlier and larger conical moimd of La Tiniere, which
was deposited while the Lake of Geneva was maintained at a higher level. The
result gives for this cone 1000 centuries ; and M. Morlot regards it as a fair approx-

--imation to the length of "post-glacial" time the term "post-glacial," as we

employ it in England, being supposed to agree with the end of the last great ex-

tension of ice in the Alps.

translations, executed by that gentleman, of the interesting memoirs which lie liad

                                               On the Distribution of Granite Blocls from Wasdah Craig.
                                                     By Prof. Phillips, M.A., LL.D., F.R.S., F.G.8.

   For more than thirty years the attention of the author has been earnestly fixed
on the remarkable facts which have been observed by Prof. Sedgwick and himself

in regard to the dispersion of granite blocks, from Wasdale Craig, over higli and
low gTound across Yorkshire and certain tracts of neighbouring counties. While
in the drainage of the Eden and the large tracts embraced by the northern and
eastern branches of the Huniber, and the long depression on the ^^estern side of the

carboniferous chain of Yorkshire and Lancashire, these blocks occur even plenti-
fully, they are quite unknown in every part of the country to the westward of the
parent rock. In tracing the com-se 6i the blocks from the extreme south-east of
Yorkshire back to their origin, it is found that they by no means follow the valleys
and avoid the heights, but that, on the contrary, with little or no difference, they
occur alilce on hills and dales, though not on the very highest, till on Stainmoor, at
the north-western extremity of Yorkshire, they appear on surfaces raised 1400 feet

above the sea. Through this pass of Stainmoor, which, though so much elevated,

is in fact a great transverse depression in the carboniferous chain, the blocks have

passed on as through a strait of an ancient sea. At no other point have the blocks

crossed the chain. Turning now from Stainmoor to the west, we remark that in all

the intermediate country, whether elevated to about 1000 feet above the sea, or only

to about 500, blocks of the granite are frequent ; and on approaching the site froni

which all have passed, they grow so numerous as even to be counted by hundreds

and thousands. The summit of Wasdale Craig, being elevated only 1479 feet above

the sea, it is ob-sdously not possible to explain the distribution of rocks which has

been sketched, either by the movement of glaciers, or the floatation of icebergs, with-

out some particular suppositions in regard to the relative levels of several tracts of

land                      even if we leave out of account any perplexity as to the relative levels of land
                       ;

and sea. During a few late years, the author has turned special attention to Wasdale

Craig itself, and to the distribution of granite blocks in its immediate vicinity, and

he presents a map, showing this distribution for a few miles from the Craig. As

already observed, they are too numerous to be counted in all the country for one or

two miles to the eastward, whatever be the aspect, or shape, or slope of the ground,

while none occur to the westward. Wasdale Craig is itself within the drainage of

the Lune. To the north and west of it the summit of drainage between the Lime

and the Eden is traced over varying heights, greater and less than that of the Craig.

This drainage summit is passed by the blocks, at a level below 1000 feet, on a line

a little to the north of east. South-westward of the Craig is the watershed between

the Lune and the Kent. This summit appears not to have been passed at all,
though in many places it is much below the height of the granite Craig. The

blocks are often of very large size : some within two or three miles of the Craig are

12, 14, 18 feet, an* even more in the largest dimensions ; and at Thirsk, seventy miles

off, a block was found 13 feet in diameter. They seldom appear to have been

rolled, but yet, perhaps by ordinary surface waste, they have often become blunted

at the angles. The author is convinced, by his frequent examination of the pheno'-

mena, 1. that the distribution to such great distances, in directions not confomied

to natural courses of di-ainage, can be best explained by the agency of ice ; 2. that
it cannot have been eflected by glacier movement on the laud at its present absolute

elevation                                      3.             that it cannot have been performed by iceberg floatation on an ocean
                                            ;

however elevated, if the present relative elevations of the country were tken the
same as now
                                                           ;  A. that the excessive abundance of blocks near the Craig, and in the

region fronting it to the east, seems to require the supposition of a considerable

disturbing force,^which greatly shattered the Craig, and provided a large quantity

of removable blocks before the ice action came on. On the whole, the author sup-

poses that during the glacial period such a disturbance took place ; that the lake

district was depressed                                                                                                   that icebergs formed from shore ice, and at moderate depttfs
                                                                                                                      ;

the east, while that was relatively lower than it is at present, and that afterwards
the distribution of the blocks near Wasdale Craig took place while the land was

rising. And he computes roughly that if the blocks now visible in the region
round Wasdale Craig were restored to it, and placed in the gi-anitic area now ex-

posed, they would cover it in every part to the depth of about 3 feet. The blocks
of stone now seen to be loosened around the Craig, and lying against its steeps,
would not amoimt to one-thousandth part of this quantity, from which the author
draws an argument in support of his views, of the preparatory concussions neces-
sary to produce enough masses for the ice to transport. On another point of some
difficulty he offered a few remarks. Both near the Craig, and at small distances from
it, the quantity of other stones distributed by the same agency as the granite is
relatively very small, and the masses are of small magnitude. At very great dis-
tances, as sixty or eighty miles away in Yorkshire, this disproportion as to quan-
tity is less remarkable, but the granite blocks are still usually the largest. The
author believes that the difference of magnitude between the granitic and the
schistose blocks maybe iiuderstood by the much gi-eater prevalence of joints in the
latter, which produces now, in some sorts of schistose rocks, near Wasdale Craig,
f)retty extensive " screes," while the sides of the granitic cliffs are encumbered with
 arge rock masses. The difference of quantity he supposes to be explicable by the
peculiar conditions of the formation of the ice, which he conceives to have gene-
rally picked up the blocks by adherence to the lower sm-face of the freezing mass,
and not, as in ordinary glaciers, to have received them on the upper surface.

    On a Peculiar Fossil fomul in the Mesozoic Sandstone of the Connecticut
                       Valley, discovered by Prof. W. B. Eogeks.

    Professor H. D. Rogers of Glasgow, at the desire of his brother Professor William
 B. Rogers of Boston, United States, drew the attention of the Section to a cast in
 plaster of some fossil bones in the Mesozoic, probably Triassic, Red Sandstone of
 the valley of the Connecticut River in Massachusetts. The original flat block of
 sandstone imbedding these almost unique bones was discovered recently by the
 last-named gentleman in a pile of the material which he traced to the very quarry
 whence it has been lately extracted, thus identifying precisely the geological site

 of the fossil. Upon a carefid scrutiny of the fossilized bones, competent zoologists
 have pronounced them to partake of both bird and reptilian characteristics. This

 lends to the specimens a high scientific interest ; that very recently there have
 appeared other independent proofs of the reptilian or semi-reptilian oi-igin of very

 many of those foot-marks on the Connecticut Red Sandstone, which, until the
 publication of these proofs in tbe beautiful posthumous work of Dr. James Deane

 of Greenfield, Massachusetts, have been mistakenly regarded as almost invariably
 the foot-steps of bu-ds. (See ' Ichnogi-aphs from the Sandstone of Connecticut

     The author drew attention to the two maps he produced ; one, that of Mr. A. G.
 Bain, published by the Geological Society of London in their ' Transactions ;' the
 other coloured, to show the changes rendered necessary by the discoveries of the
  last few years ; the latest being the finding of Upper Silvman fossils at the Knysna,
 by Mr. Thomas Bain, and of a species of Knorria resembling one of tbe same genus
  from Port Francis, which prove the Palaeozoic character of the clay-slate as far as
  Zwellandam at least, while the discovery of Calamites in Pegnet-berg proves that
  the Table Mountain sandstones are not older than the Silurian period. The author

conjectured some years ago, from tlieir unconformability with the slates of Capo

Town, now shown to be probably Devonian, that they might be of Triassic age, or
possibly outliers of the Lacustrine formation. By these discoveries an area ex-
ceeding that of the British Isles requires transferring to ditierent formations. But
this was considered of minor importance in comparison with the relations of the
rocks which led Mr. Bain into error. The author had pointed out this relation some

years ago, and predicted that the primary clay-slate (Silurian and Carboniferous
beds of Bain) woidd probably prove to belong to one gTeat Palaeozoic formation.
The relation alluded to was" the conversion of beds of widely different ages, but
contiguous, into a quartzose sandstone or quartzite, causing beds of Silurian rock to
lie conformably on inclined quartzite, which was continuous with horizontal rock
of like character resting unconformably on Silurian rock. The quartzite mountain-
ranges extend from Table Mountain eastward to near the nioutli of the Great
Fish River ; but, while the sandstones of which they are composed are imcon-
formable in the west, they are interstratified with the Palaeozoic schists in the

--east, still, however, crossing their strike at an angle of 30° or more, and by spurs

in other directions, so modifying the sections that two lines across the strike, dis-

tant only a few miles, often cross wholly diiferent rock, one section being quartzite
with but a few interlaminated schists, the other all schist. This was explained in
tlie same manner as above, ^-iz. by the silicitication of the beds of schists, the

mountain-chains originating eitlier in the silicifpng action taking certain lines, or

in denudation into their present forms. Reasons were given for believing this
silicification to be a surface-change due to aqueous action. There are no igneous
rocks in the parts most ailected by this change, and the cuttings made by rivers and

by artificial means through the quartzite often expose the slate at the bottom.

On some New Forms of Olenokl TrUoUtcs from the Loivest Fossiliferous BocJcs
                   of Wales. By J. W. Salter, A.L.S., F.G.S.

   The grey rocks and black shales at the base of the Lower Lingula-flags, in which
]Mr. Salter discovered, two years ago, the great Puradoxides Davidis, are being fully
explored (-ndth the aid of a grant from the British Association) by Mr. Henry
Hicks. His energetic work has akeady brought to light more than thirty species
of fossils, most of them Trilobites. Some of these are quasi-embryonic forms, such

as Microdiscus, which, like Agnostus, is a blind Trilobite without facial sutures
but it has four body-rings, instead of two. There are also species of Conocoryphe

and Agnostus, both of them well-kno-v\Ti genera, and others allied to Arionellus of

Barrande ; all of them have a ' primordial ' aspect. Among the new discoveries is a

genus ns.-m&&. Atiopolenus, a remarkable form, which at first seemed to have the head
devoid of eyes and of any facial suture. Later observations, however, have dis-

--cerned the cheeks, eyes, and head-spines in a most abnormal position placed far

forward on the head, and so easily separable as to justify the previous belief in thek
entire absence. In order to find a parallel for this bizarre form, the author was

obliged to describe a new Olenus, or rather Spharophihabnus, found bj' Mr. Turner,
of Pauntley, in the Black Shales of Malvern. In this fossil the characters so much
exaggerated in Anopolemis are less strongly pronoimced ; and the new genus is thus
connected with the older and better known forms of the Olenidce, the most ancient

--TrDobite family, if we except Agnostus and its allies which were probably coeval

with them. It is worthy of remark that in this earliest family (Olenidte) the

largest size attained by the group of Trilobites is reached, the great Paradoxides

Harlani being nearly 22 inches long.

    In reply to a question put by Mr. Pengelly, Mr. Salter stated that the exceptional
blind species found in the latest formations known to contain Trilobites are degraded
forms of the highest genera, namely, Phacojis and PhiUipsia, and that there is good
evidence of a progression in the development of the gToup from its commencement

in the Cambrian to its extinction in the Coal period.

Hicks) the Cambrian rocks of St. David's for the Glenoid Trilohites mentioned in
the last paper, the author paid some attention to the i-elations of the central trap-
rock of the dislrict, which runs in a broad mass, a mile or two wide, from Llanrei-
than to the headland of St. David's, and is continued out to sea in Ramsey Island.

As the purple rocks, sandstones, and slates of the whole Lower Cambrian division
are thrown up at high angles, all but vertical, on either flank of this mass, which

forms the axis of the whole country, there is no diihculty in studying its behaviour
in contact with the Cambrians. If it were an intrusive trap of later date, it would
penetrate them here and there, or at least alter them at the point of contact, as the

neighbouring granite of Brawcly and Koch actually does. On the contrary, where-

ever the boundary can be seen, steatitic and felspathic schist unaltered, and beds of

-- --thick conglomerate, mark the line, and are often very conspicuous. These conglo-

merates of quai-tz-rock, jasper, felstone, &c. may or may not have been derived
from the immediate neighbourhood. They are traceable along the south and north

sides of the trap-region, and are followed by sandstones of various degrees of coarse-
ness, but indicating by the ripple-mark, as well as the coarse material, that they

were accumidated in shallow water; and as we know that pebbles, often as large
as swan's eggs, are not carried far out to sea, but mark either a submarine shoal or
a coast-line, we are compelled to assign them to a source near at hand. The upper
beds of the Lower Cambrian formation are finer-grained and lighter-coloured, and

--pass insensibly into grey and then into thin black beds of the Lingiila-flags, with

trappean ashes and lava-flows the great Upper Cambrian formation.
    Comparing this order of things with what occm's in North Wales, one is struck

with the wonderful similarity in the two regions ; coarse conglomerate and purple
shale, red sandstones, and then grey rocks, passing into black, deep-water shales.
Crossing the channel it is the same ; the Lower Cambrian rocks of Wicklow give
evidence of accumulation in shallow water ; and Sir R. I. Murchison has shown us
exactly the same thing, even exaggerated, in the conglomerates of North-western
Scotland ; but these rest directly on the Old Laurentian rocks, from which they
seem to have been derived. The Hebrides and the west coast of Sutlierland were
land or shallow water when the Cambrian pebble-beds were formed aromid them.

We do not know the land which supplied the pebble-bands and sandstones of

North Wales and Shropshire ; but the researches of Dr. H. B. HoU haA'e shown us

 that the Malvern Hills were a low reef of rocks at this time ; and everything points
 to a shallow sea, studded with islets and reefs, as the condition of things which
 existed in our area, probably also in Normandy and the Channel Islands, at this

 time. Again, the old Lam-entian gneiss is remarkable for its syenitic character.

 Syenite is common ; true granite is comparatively rare in these old rocks. This is
 the case in Canada, where they are best seen. Dr. Holl has shown it to be the
 case at Malvern, and hence we should look for it in Wales. The mass of igneous

 rock, which forms the backbone of the St. David's peninsula, and which supports,
 without penetrating them, the shallow-water accumulations of the older Canibrian

 around it, is syenitic in character. The quartz-veins penetrating it may well have
 supplied the pebbles ; and the felspathic matter was the origin of the softer schists

 of the rocks which lie around it. That there was shallow water, with rocky ground

 close by, is eAident ; and in the absence of any evidence to the contrarj', the author
 suggests that the syenitic trap of St. David's is a part of the old pre-Cambrian

 land. As he did not visit Ramsey Island, the evidence is incomplete. It will be
 necessary to see whether the Cambrians there are affected by the trap, or lie upon

 it unaltered; as he believes is the case with those of St. David's.

  This map has been constructed by reducing about 220 parish-maps to the scale
of 4 inches to the mile, or 20 chains to the inch. The map comprises a large por-
tion of the geological series, ranging from the Lower Silurian up to the lower divi-

sion of the Cretaceous system. VVith respect to the coal strata, as the deposits of a
later age occupy a large portion of the country, only one half of the coal strata of
the northern part of the oasin, and only a tenth or twentieth part of the southern

excellent quality, are entirely concealed beneath liassic and even oolitic strata.

The coal-measures proper have a thickness of about 5000 feet, divisible into an

upper and lower series of coal seams, separated by the Pennant grit rocks. They

contain about ninety feet of coal, of which about one half is workable.

 Notice of Carnassial and Canirx Teeth from the Mendip Caverns, prohahly

    belonging to Fells antiqua (syn. Pardus). Bi/ W. A. Sanfoed, F.G.S.

   Among a quantity of Hycena and Felh spelcpa teeth, Mr. Sanford found the

canines and carnassial, whicli presented precisely the characters, both in size and
form, of Felis Pardus, which appeared to him identical with F. antiqiia of Cuvier.

These teeth were discovered by the late Eev. M. Williams, and are now with his
collection in the Taunton Museum. From information obtained from Mr. Beard,

the teeth came from the Hutton cave in the Mendip.

On the Pterodactyle as Evidence of a new Subclass of Vertebrata (Sauromia).

                               By Hakrt Seelet, F.G.S.

The author gave an account of the entire skeleton, the history, and classification

of Pterodactyles. In the head he described fi-om Upper Greensand examples the

following  bones                              basi-occipital,  basi-temporal,  basi-sphenoid,  ex-occipital, supra-
                                           :

occipital, parietal, alisphenoid, squamosal, petrosal, quadrate, quadrato-jugal,

orbito-ethmo-sphenoid, the vomer, os articulare, and proximal end of the lower

jaw, and the premaxillaiy, maxillary, and dentaiy bones. The sutures were

obliterated as in birds, the quadrate bone had the same double articulation with the

cranium a.s in birds, the squamosal bone was the same ; and the conclusion from

the svun of the bones was that, excepting the teeth, there is no character in the

skull to distinguish the Pterodactj-le from a bird. It is peculiar in that the basi-

occipital neither enters into the foramen magnum nor the floor for the brain or the
base of the skidl. And the quadrate and quadrato-jugal are anchvlosed, the latter

being squamous. The cranium approaches most nearly to that of the common

Cock. The pectoral arch was described, the homology of the bones discussed, and
the furcula shown to be attached to the radial processes of the humeri. The author

went through the comparative osteology of the remainder of the skeleton, and

showed that it supported the conclusion from the skull. The writings of Buck-

land, Owen, Huxley, Cuvier, Yon Meyer, Goldfuss, Wagner, Quenstedt, &c., were

reviewed, and shown to contain nothing to support the hypothesis that Ptero-

-- --dactyles were reptiles. The Sauropsida, therefore, were divided into three sections
   Aves and Sauromia, and Reptilia the Sauromia being birds with teeth, with

peculiar  wings, tarsus                          and  metatarsus   separate,   and  reptilian  types  of  vertebrae,

like the fossil birds Palteocolpnhus and Pelagornis of the Upper Greensand. Mr.

Seeley then described as new species Pterodactylns Huxleyi, P. machcerorhynchis,

P. Jfopkinsi, P. Oiceni, P. Carteri{?), and completed the descriptions of Owen's

species P. Sedywickt, P. Fittoni, P. Woodwardi, P. sivius, and identified P. Cuvieii--

thus adding six ; so that now there are ten species * from the Upper Greensand and
one (P. Cuvieri) common to the Greensand and Chalk. In conclusion, he discussed
the affinities of the known Pterodactyles with one another and their classification.

              On the Significance of the Sequence of Bodes and Fossils.
                                By Habrt Seelet, F.G.S.

  Assuming that the clays are the mud of rivers, that the sandstones are the

detritus of old crystalline rocks, and that limestones were organically or chemically
formed, the author contrasted the Cretaceous and Jurassic rocks, and the sequence o'f
the beds they include, and, from the alternation of strata, deduced the alternations

of upheaval of continents and the nature of the rocks presented for denudation. He

                                     * Several more have been found since.

then, by way of illustration, worked out the physical geography of the Cretaceous

period, using as data the rocks of the eastern and northern counties ; and, ha^-ing
considered the effects of these physical revolutions upon the fauna of the ocean
floor, it was concluded that the operation of elevation and depression, in the ways
pointed out, might have produced all the phenomena of existing life-provinces on
land and by sea, and similar life-provinces in the seas of past time. It was then
shown that the breaks between strata do not generally indicate denudation or breaks

in time, but merely upheaval or depression of old lands, bringing into wear new
rock-material and causing the immigi-ation of a new pro\"ince of marine life. Mr.

Seeley concluded by contesting the idea that extinct species could tell anything
about the phj-sical conditions imder which they lived. All the different distribution
of existing analogues, as compared with their fossU antetypes, was the result of

migration of species, and not of changing climate.

On the Thermal Water of the Clifford Amalgamated Mines of Cornwall.
                    By W. W. Smyth, M.A., F.B.S., F.G.S.

The North, or Hot Lode of the Cliflbrd Mines, formerly known as that of the

United Mines, is one of a group of east and west veins which are encased in the

Camclay-slate or killas, on the east of the granite hill of  Marth. Mr. Kenwood's

observations, a quarter of a century ago, showed that water had been met with at

several places, varying fi'oni 1104 to 12G0 feet deep, of the temperature of from 90°

to 100° Fahr. In 1839 a cross-cut at the United Mines intersected a large feeder

of very hot water, and with it a rich lode of copper pyrites, which has since been

continuously worked eastward and downward. The author found, in 1855, the

chief spring welling upwards in a level 1510 feet deep, with a temperature of 114°.

In July 1864, from the extension of the excavations in depth and eastward, he

foimd, at 1620 feet deep, that three themiometers placed in the water marked 122°.

The lode at this point was of moderate size, and improving as it was followed east

being in the 220-fathom level (1590 feet deep fi-om surface) 12 to 16 feet wide, and

yielding a very large amount of rich copper ore. The spring is estimated to give

150 gallons per minute ; and although chloride of sodiimi is abundant in it, the

low percentage of magnesian salts, as compared with sea-water, as well as the

situation of the lode, render it unlikely that the water is derived directly from the
sea. The absence of sulphates of iron and copper, as shown by Prof. Miller's ana-

lysis, seems to set aside the hypothesis of the heat being due to the decomposition

of the sulphides.

   The exceptionally high temperature of the water was not observable when the

workings were shallow, partly perhaps owing to the closer texture of the vein, and

partly to the large area over which the warm water seems to have been diffused.

On the Conclusion to be draiun from the Physical Structure of some Meteorites.         I
                            By H. C. SoRBY, F.li.S., F.G.S.

   The author had elsewhere * shown that the earliest condition of meteorites of
which their microscopical structure furnishes evidence was that of igneous fusion.

There are, however, some, like the Pallas iron, consisting of a mixture of iron and

olivine, which apparently strongly oppose this view, if we merely judge from what
occurs when such substances are melted artificially ; for then the iron, being so
much more dense, would sink to the bottom, and the olivine rise to the top, like
slag in a furnace. The object of the paper was, however, to show that this dif-

ference in density depends on the force of gravitation, and that, on the smface of a
small planetary body, or towards the interior of a larger, iron and olivine might
remain mixed in a state of fusion long enough to allow of gradual crystal-
lization. Such meteorites should therefore be considered evidence of fusion where

the force of gravitation was very snuxll ; and this conclusion may be valuable in

decidino' between rival theories of their origfin.

               On the Loivest Beds of the Clifton Carhoniferous Series.
                        By W. "W. Stoddart, F.G.S., Bristol.

   The author, after briefly describing the Clifton scenery, and the advantages that
locality affords for geological study, gave a short summary of the rocks which range
in one unbroken line from the Millstone-giit on Brandon Hill to the Old Ked Sand-

stone below Cook's Folly.

   It is to the lowest beds of these lying immediately on the Old Red that this

paper referred.

   The highest of the beds now in question is the well-known palate bed, contain-

ing a large nimiber of the teeth and spines of fishes, Iclithyocopri, Brachiopoda,

Pteropoda, Polyzoa, &c.

   The principal fossils from the bed are

Fenestella                        Cladodus conicus.
Ceriopora rhombifera.             Chomatodus linearis.
Spirifera bisulcata.              Ctenacanthus tenuistriatus.
                                  Helodus Isevissimus.
          glabra.
Discina nitida.                   Psammodus porosus.

Lingula mytiloides.               Coprolites.

Conulai'ia quadrisulcata.

   Under this are seen three beds of red crystalline limestone, the middle one of
which the author described in the ' Annals of Natural History,' 1857.

   It dips to the S.S.E. at an angle of 68°, and contains one of the most extraordi-
nary assemblages of fossils perhaps ever seen. All of them do not exceed ^^th of

an inch in diameter, and many are less than 100th of an inch. They are composed

of a peculiar combination of peroxide of iron and silica, and are perfectly insoluble

in cold nitric and hydrochloric acids.

   The fossils constitute more than 20 per cent, by weight of the rock. From a
pound weight of the limestone were obtained more than a million and a half of

perfect fossils besides debris.

   It was most probably a bank exposed to the littoral waves of a Carboniferous sea

--which would wash away the large shells, leav-ing the smaller just as we now see

going on at many places of our o^vn coast, as Silsea Bill, Caldy Island, &c.
   The fossils more commonly found are

Poteriocrinus.                Ceriopora rhombifera (Goldf).
Platycrinus                   Pleurotomaria pygmaea (n. sp.).

Cythere ovalis (n. sp.).      Euomphalus triangulatus (n. sp.).

Cy therella lunata (n. sp.).  Natica plicistria ( Yoimg).

   Passing downward through a thickness of 8 or 9 feet, the author found a bed of
dark gi'ey shaly marl. It probably corresponds to No. 428 in Mr. WiUiams's Sec-
tion, and is the most important of the whole series to the geologist. It contains
fossils that occur in no other of the limestone beds at Clifton. The principal of
these are 3£odiola Macadumi, Arictda Damtioniemis, Katica 2}licistria, Spirorhis otii-

j)luilodes, Cypridina Scotohurdigalemis, Cypriduia subrectus, Knorria dichotoma, &c.

   The Modiolce are in immense masses, and sometimes covered with the remains
of Entomostraca and Spu'rorhis. Below this shaly bed continue 70 feet of alter-
nating limestones, shales, and marls, and then 30 feet of passage beds into the Old
Red, which properly commences by the well-known quartzose conglomerate.

   The author then alluded to the corresponding Lower Limestone shales in the
northern pai-t of Derry, and the section described by General Portlock on the
Moyola and Altagowan rivers, and pomted out the very great similarity both litho-
logically and paleeontologically.

    After comparing these with the Coomhola grits of Messrs. Jukes and Salter,
and the Marwood Section of hitherto so-called Upper Devonian in Devonshire, the
author showed that no doubt could exist of the Modiola shales at Clifton being a
representative of them all. It is true that the larger Brachiopoda are missing at
Clifton that ai'e foimd in Ireland, where the thickness of the lower shales is enor-
mous, as at Glengariff Harbour ; but, on the other hand, in those Irish sections
72, REPORT 1864.

which are thin, as in Ballynascreen, the fossils are only those found at Clifton.
Then, again, in the largely developed Glengarifl" beds are found fossils identical
with those of the Marwood sandstone.

  --This is ifiore easily seen by the following Table :

are as dark as if they had been freshly broken from the matrix. One remarkable
characteristic of this breccia is the extreme hardness of the crystalline limestone
which forms it. If, as Mr. Dawkins considers, some of the teeth are identical
wath those of our existing Reindeer, with the Ked Deer, Elk, Bos primiyenius, and
Bison minor, we have the ancient range of those quadrupeds extended to a point
more southerly than any previously ascertained.

On the Sulphur and Bitumen Deposit at tlie South-West Corner of the Dead
               Sea. By the Rev. H. B. Tristram, M.A., F.L.S.

The Mahawat is a broad, deep, dry ravine, commencing two miles to the south-

west of the Dead Sea and running up to the westward, being the drainage debouch

--of the Negeb. The Wady is similar in character to the Wady Zuweirah the

same shai-p cutting through the old limestone, only on a much larger scale, the

same deposition of the post-tertiary marl, the same entire denudation of this latter.

But, since the post-tertiary marl has been altogether getting washed out, there has

been a second filling in of an extraordinary character, which is only now in course

of being washed out. Masses of bitumen, mingled with gi-avel overlying a thin

stratum of sulphur, which again overlies a thicker stratum of sand so strongly im-

pregnated with sulphur that it yields powerful fumes on being sprinkled over a hot

coal, are exposed on the sides of the Wadj-, chiefly on the south. Many large masses

have been washed down, and are scattered on the plain  Here is the only trace

of igneous action we have met with in our most careful examination of the coasts so

far. The author had a dread of attempting to corroborate Scripture by natural or

physical arguments which may be refuted ; for the objector is apt to think that, when

he has refuted the weak argument, he has refuted the Scriptural statement ; but, so

far as he miderstood it, if there be any physical evidence left on earth of a catastrophe

similar to that which destroyed the cities of the plain, it is here. The whole ap-

pearance points to a shower of hot sulphur and an eruption of bitumen upon it, cal-

cined and impregnated by its fumes, and this at a geological period quite subsequent

to all the diluvial and alluvial actions. It may have been from a sulphm* and bitu-

men spring on the spot, when the flow of water was more abundant ; but of this we
could detect no trace. Unfortunately no traveller has ever penetrated the Wady

before us, and therefore we have no opinions of more competent observers to guide

us. Robinson and Yandevelde passed to the south of it. De Saulcy^ Porter, Wol-

cott, and Poole all went to the north.

On the Family of the Eurypteridce, with Descriptions of some New Genera and
                      Species. By Hexrt "Woodward, F. O.S.

   The author gave a sketch of the history of this group of Palseozoic Crustacea,

and illustrated the peculiarities of each genus by a series of diagrams. He pointed

out the close affinities which the Eurypteridce display to the Limnlidce (King-
crabs), a group which begins in the coal-measures and appears to have existed

(with slight modifications in form) fr-om that period to the present time. Mr.

Woodward defined the fonns belonging to the genera Pteryyottis, Eurypterns,

--Slimonia, and Stylomirns, and described others belonging to the new genus ITe-

miaspis in all, thirtj'-three British species. With the exception of Hemiaspis
from the Lower Ludlow rocks of Lemtwardine, Shropshire, the new material
collected since the publication of Messrs. Huxley and Salter's Monograph in 1859
has all resulted from the independent labours of Mr. James Powrie, F.G.S., of
Reswallie in Forfarshire, and Mr. Robert Slimon, of Lesmahagow in Lanarkshire.

On the Development of Ammonites. By Dr. Thomas Weight, F.R.S.E., F.G.S.

   The author first stated the difficulties the Palaeontologist experienced in attempt-
ing to imderstand the synonyms of several species of Ammonites, as many of the
species had been established on imperfect or transitional forms. By reference to

the moi-phology of the Acalephse, Echinodermata, Insecta, and Crustacea, he ex-

plained how many of the species in these classes pass through more or less exten-

sive changes in form and structure between their escape from the egg and their

Ammonites. From an extensive series of specimens he had collected from the Lias

and Oolitic formations, he could show, 1st, that one group of species exhibit very-

        Ammonites Jamesoni, Sow.                           Ammonites caprieoi'nus, Schloth.

   The author gave a detailed description of the moi-phological changes exhibited
by each of these species, and demonstrated that Ammonites planicosttitus, Sow. was
the young shell oi Am. Dudrcssieri, d'Orbig. This species acquired spines on the

dorsal border of the ribs in the second phase of its growth, wliich became tubercles

in a third stage, and these it finally lost as it advanced to maturity. Am. Jamesoni,
Sow., was shown to be the adult form of A. Bromiii, llrem., with tubercles on the
ribs, and a rudimentary keel ; in a second stage of growth it became Am. Megnardi,
d'Orbig., and afterwards changed to the elegant form figured by Sowerby. Am. ca-

pricornits in its different phases of development had been the tj'pe of six figured

&species : in early age it was Am. maculatits, Y. B. ; a little older it was Am. plani-

costa, d'Orbig., and Am. latcecostus, Sow. ; in middle age, when the last whorl ex-
panded somewhat abruptly, and supported two rows of small tubercles on the late-

ral ribs, it formed the Am. hetenn/enes, Y. & B. ; and two-thirds of the last whorl in
this stage of growth was figured by Sowerby as Am. Hcnltyi, Sow.

    These facts were demonstrated by a series of specimens exhibiting the morpho-
logical characters of the dift'erent species described, and the important practical

bearing of the subject on Palajoutology was dwelt upon. Ammonites were now

 generally admitted to be the best indicators of the stratigraphical position of the
 dift'erent zones of life in the secondary rocks, and it was therefore all tlie more im-
 portant to geology that the species of this group should be rigorously detennined
 which coidd only be done by a critical examination of tlieir morphological charac-
 ters ; for mere species-making, without such knowledge, was hindrance, and not

 progi'ess, in the present state of Palaeontology.

  On the White Lias of Dorsetshire. By Dr. T. "Weight, F.R.S.E., KG.S.

   In this paper the author showed that the tenuAMiite Lias, as used by Buckland,
Smith, De la Beche and others, required a more con-ect definition than had been
ffiven to it hitherto, as it inchided beds of a light colour, which belonged to two
distiiict zones of life ; the upper half consisted of light-coloured lias beds, with
Ammonites 2)lano7-bis and Ostrea Hassictr, forming- the zone oi Ammonites 2}l(i>iorbis,
whilst the lower portion of the White Ijias was composed of a series of light-coloured
concretionary limestones, having a rubbly character in parts, with a conchoidal
fracture. These thick beds were at Up-Lyme, Axminster, and Pinhav Bay from
20 to 25 feet in thickness, and contained a great number of small shells in the form
of moulds : Pecten valoniensis, Axinus modiola, and CarcUmn rhcetinnn had been
foimd in them at Up-Lyme. Dr. Wright considered this lower portion of the
"White Lias belonged to the Avicula contorta beds, or infra-lias of some Continental

authors, as no true lias fossil shells were found in it. He had correlated these beds

with some of the upper beds of the Avicida contorta series, at Garden Cliif and Aust
Cliff, on the Severn, and at Penarth, Glamorganshire, and he had come to the con-
clusion that the concretionaiy White Lias at the base of the Pinhay Bay section
must be considered as the upper portion of the Avicula contorta series.

BOTANY AND ZOOLOGY, ikoluding PHYSIOLOGY.

            Address by Dr. J. E. Gray, President of the Section.

Befork entering upon the special business for which the Section has been called

together, viz. the consideration of the Reports to be presented upon various zoolo-

gical and botanical subjects, and the reading of the papers submitted by the

members, I should wish to make a few general observations on some topics which
appear to me to have an important bearing on the science which we study, in the
hope that they may elicit some observations from the members present. I have

always felt that one of the most important uses of the Association was the bringing

together of so large a body of men engaged in kindred pm-suits, and the consequent

promotion of fi-ee personal intercourse between those who, not inhabiting the same

locality or even the same country, were scarcely likely to meet except on such an oc-

casion as the present. In such meetings the free interchange of thought by means of

oral communication  is  most valuable                                                                     for  it  is  in  this  way that  facts  are  most
                                                                                                       ;

readily brought into notice, and opinions most freely canvassed, that truth is most

effectually elicited, and that erroneous or cmde ideas are dissipated, con-ected, and

improved.

Some of my predecessors in this ofBce have given a summary resume of the

recent progi-ess of science in the departments over which I ha^e now the honoiu-

to preside, and I had at first thought of attempting to follow their example ; but I
find myself precluded from so doing by the conviction that, in order to be of any

real utility, such a Eeport shoidd be of much greater length and fidness of detail

than the time at our disposal woidd fairly admit for the reading, or than the few

weeks which have elapsed since I was requested to undertake the office would
myallow of
            preparing. This is, however, the less to be regretted, inasmuch as,

in the com-se of each year, a body of laborious and talented German professors are

in the habit of preparing a very fidl and complete Report of this nature for the

Berlin ' .Aj'chives of Natm-al Ilistoiy,' after a plan similar to that which I myself
commenced, more than forty years ago, in Thomson's 'Annals of Philosophy.' I
have therefore abandoned all intention of attempting such a review, and proceed at
once to speak of subjects having a more general bearing upon the interests of our

science.

  I should wish to say a few words on the subject of Public Museums. It may be
imagined that, having the whole of my life been intimately connected with the

management of what I believe to be at the present day the most important zoolo-

gical museum in the world, it is a subject that has long and deeply occupied my
--76 REPORT 1864.

thoughts ; and it -will also be readily believed that it is only after serious and pro-
longed consideration I have come to the conclusion that the plan hitherto pursued
in their an-angemont has rendered them less useful to science and less interesting
to the public at large than they might have been made under a different system.

Let us consider the purposes for which such a museum is established.
   These are two : 1st, the difhision of instruction and rational amusement among

the mass of the people ; and 2nd, to aftbrd the scientific student every possible

means of examining and studying the specimens of which the museum consists.
Now, it appears to me that, in the desire to combine these two objects, which are

essentially distinct, the first object, namely the general instruction of the people,
has been to a great extent lost sight of and sacrificed to the second, without any
corresponding advantage to the latter, because the system itself has been thoroughly
erroneous. The curators of large museums have naturally, and, perhaps, properly,
been men more deeply devoted to scientific study than interested in elementary
instruction, and they have consequently done what they thought best for the pro-
motion of science by accumulating and exhibiting on the shelves or in the open

cases of the museum every specimen which they possess, without considering that
by so doing they were overwhelming the general visitor with a mass of imintelli-
gible objects, and at the same time rendering their attentive study by the man of

science more difficult and onerous than if they had been brought into a smaller
space and in a more available condition.

   What the largest class of visitors, the general public, want, is a collection of the

more interesting objects so arranged as to att'ord the greatest possible amount of

information in a moderate space, and to be obtained, as it were, at a glance. On

the other hand, the scientific student requires to have under his eyes and in his
hands the most complete collection of specimens that can be brought together, and
in such a condition as to admit of the most minute examination of their differences,
whether of age, or sex, or state, or of whatever kind that can throw light upon all
the innumerable questions that are continually arising in the progress of thought

and opinion.

   Every scientific student requires the cases to be opened, to allow him to examine
and handle the specimens, and in the stuffed state this cannot be often done with-
out injury 5 and an artist always requires them to be taken out of the case for his

purpose.

   In the futile attempt to combine these two purposes in one consecutive arrange-

ment, the modem nuiseum entirely fails in both particulars. It is only to be

compared to a large store or a city warehouse, in which every specimen that can

be collected is arranged in its proper case and on its proper shelf, so that it may be
found when wanted ; but the uninformed mind derives little instruction from the

contemplation of its stores, while the student of nature requires a far more careful
examination of them than is possible under such a system of arrangement, to derive
any advantage ; the visitor needs to be as well informed -with relation to the system
on which it is based as the curator himself; and consequently the general visitor
perceives little else than a chaos of specimens, of which the bulk of those placed
in close proximity are so nearly alike that he can scarcely perceive any difference
between them, even supposing them to be placed on a level with the eye, while
the gi'eater number of those which are above or below this level are utterly unin-

telligible.

   To such a visitor, the numerous species of rats, or squirrels, or spaiTows, or larks
that crowd the shelves, from all parts of the world, are but a rat, a squirrel, a
sparrow, or a lark ; and this is still more especially the case Avith animals of a less
marked and less known type of character. Experience has long since convinced
me that such a collection so an'anged is a great mistake. The eye both of the
general ^-isitor and of the student becomes confused by the number of the speci-
mens, however systematically they may be brought together.

   The very extent of the collection renders it difficult eveu for the student, and
much more so for the less scientific visitor, to discover any particular specimen of
which he is in quest; and the larger the collection, the greater this difficulty becomes.

Add to this the fact that all specimens, but more especially the more beautiful and

the more delicate, are speedily deteriorated, and in some cases destroyed for all
                  TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                                                                77

useful purposes, by exposure to light, and tliat both the skins and bones of animals
are fouud to be much more susceptible of nieasuremiMit and compiivison in an uu-

stuffed or unmounted state, and it will be at once apparent why almost all scientific
zoologists have adopted for their own collections the simpler and more advantageous

plan of keeping their specimens in boxes or in drawers, devoted each to a family,

a genus, or a section of a genus, as each individual case may require.

Thus preserved and thus arranged, the most perfect and the most useful collec-

tion that the student could desire woidd occupy comparatively a small space, and
by no means require large and lofty halls for its reception. As it is desirable that

each large group should be kept in a separate room, and as wall-space is what is

chiefly required for the reception of the drawers or boxes, rooms like those of an
ordinary dwelling-house would be best fitted for the accommodation of such a col-

--lection and of the students by whom it would be consulted one gTeat advantage

of this plan being that students would be uninterrupted by the ignorant curiosity

of the ruder class of general visitors, and not liable to interference from scientific

rivals.

   There are other considerations also which should be taken into account in esti-

Amating the advantages of a collection thus preserved and thus arranged.

particular value is attached to such specimens as have been studied and described
by zoologists, as affording the certain means of identifying the animals on which

their observations were made. Such specimens ought especially to be preserved
in such a way as to be least liable to injury from exposure to light, dust, or other

extraneous causes of deterioration ; and this is best done by keeping them in a

state least exposed to these destructive influences, instead of in the open cases of
a public and necessarily strongly lighted gallery. This is p.articularly the case with

animals, or parts of animals, preserved in spirits, which ought to be kept in dark

closets, or cases with opaque fronts, in cool rooms, as the light very soon destroys
their colour, and the liglit and warmth cause the spirits to rapidly evaporate.

   In imitating the French plan, tlie fact was overlooked that the French, and most
Continental collections, are especially made for the use of scientific students, the

pupils of the Professor, and not, as om- National and local collections are, for

the use of the public at large, including the students, who form a very small part

of the visitors.

Again, the amount of saving thus effected in the cost of stuiHng and mounting

is well worthy of serious consideration, especially when we take into account that
this stuffing and moimting, however agreeable to the eye, is made at the cost of

rendering the specimens thus operated upon less available for scientific use.

All these arguments go to prove that, for the purposes of scientific study, the most

complete collection that could possibly be formed would be best kept in cabinets
or boxes from which light and dust would be excluded, in rooms especially devoted
to the purpose, and not in galleries open to the general public, and that such an
arrangement woidd combine the greatest advantage to the student and the most

complete preservation of the specimens with great economy of expense.

   This being done, it is easy to devise the plan of a museum which shaU be the

most interesting and instructive to general visitors, and one from which, however

short may be their stay, or however casual their inspection, they can hardly fail to
carry away some amount of valuable information.

   The larger animals, being of course more generally interesting, and easilv seen
and recognized, should be exhibited in the preserved state, and in situations 'where
they can be completely isolated. This is necessary also on account of their size,
which would not admit of their being grouped in the manner which I propose with

reference to the smaller specimens.

The older museums were for the most part made up of a number of the square

glass-fronted boxes, each containing one, or sometimes a pair of specimens. This

--method had some advantages, but many inconveniences among others, that of

occupying too large an amount of room. But I cannot help thinking that when

this was given up for the French plan of attaching each specimen to a separate

stand, and marshalling them like soldiers on the shelves of a large open case, the

improvement was not so great  as  many suppose                                                         and  this  has  become  more and
                                                                                                    ;

more evident since the researches of travellers and collectors have so largely

increased the number of known species, and of species frequently separated by

characters so minute as not to be detected without careful and close examination.

   Having come to the conclusion that a museum for the use of the general public

should consist chiefly of the best-lcuowu, the most marked, and the most interest-

ing animals, arranged in such a way as to convey the greatest amount of instruc-

tion in the shortest and most direct manner, and so exhibited as to be seen without

confusion, I am very much disposed to recm* to something like the old plan of

an-anging each species or series of species in a special case, to be placed either

on shelves or tables, or in wall-cases, as may be found most appropriate, or as
the special purpose for which each case is prepared and exhibited may seem to

require.

   But instead of each case, as of old, containing only a single specimen, it should
embrace a series of specimens, selected and arranged so as to present a special
object for study; and thus any visitor, looking at a single case only, and taking
the trouble to understand it, would carry away a distinct portion of Iniowledge,
such as in the present state of our arrangements coidd only be obtained by the
examination and comparison of specimens distributed through distant parts of the

collection.

   Every case should be distinctly labelled with an account of the pui-pose for
which it is prepared and exhibited ; and each specimen contained in it should also
bear a label indicating whj' it is there placed.

   I may be asked, why should each series of specimens be contained in a separate

case ? but I think it must be obvious that a series of objects exhibited for a defi-
nite purpose should be brought into close proximity, and contained in a well-
defined space and this will best be done by keeping them in a single and separate

                                                                           ;

case. There is also the additional advantage that whenever, in the progress of
discovery, it becomes desirable that the facts for the illustration of which the case
was prepared should be exhibited in a different manner, thi--- can easily be done by
rearranging the individual case without interfering with the general arrangement
of the coUectiou. I believe that the more clearly the object is defined and the
illustrations kept together, the greater wiU be the amount of information derived
from it by the visitor and the interest he will feel in examining it.

   Such cases may be advantageously prepared to show
    The classes of the animal kingdom.
    The orders of each class.
    The families of each order.
    The genera of each family.
    The sections of each genus, by means of one or more typical or characteristic

        examples of each class, order, or section.

   A selection of a specimen of each of the more important or striking species of

        each genus or section.

    The changes of state, sexes, habits, and manners of a well-known or an other-

         wise interesting species.

    The economic uses to which they are applied ; and such other particulars as the
       judgment and talent of the curator would select as best adapted for popular
        instruction, and of which these are only intended as partial indications.

   No one, I think, who has ever had charge of a museum, or has noted the

 behaviour of the visitors while passing through it, can doubt for a moment that
 such cases would be infinitely more attractive to the public at large than tlie
 crowded shelves of our present museums, in which they speedily become bewildered
 by the multiplicity, the apparent sameness, and at the same time the infinite
 variety of the objects presented to their view, and in regard to which the labels on
 the tops of the cases afford them little assistance, wnUe those on the specimens

 themselves are almost imintelligible.

    When such visitors really take any interest in the exhibition, it will generally

 be found that they concentrate their attention on individual objects, while others
 aflect to do the same, in order to conceal their total want of interest, of which they

 somehow feel ashamed, although it originates in no fault of their own.
    I think the time is approaching when a gi'eat change will be made in the

 an-angement of Museums of Natural History, and have therefore thrown out these
                    TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                  79

observations as suprgestions, by wliicli it appears to me that their usefuhiess may

be gi'eatly extended.

   In England, as we are well aware, all changes are well considered and slowly
adopted. Some forty years ago, the plan of placing every specimen on a separate
stand, and arranging them in rank and file in large glass wall-cases, was considered

a great step in advance, and it was doubtless an imj)rovement on the preexisting
plan, especially at a time when om- collections were limited to a small number of
species, which were scarcely more than types of our modern families or genera.

   The idea had arisen that the English collections were smaller than those on the
Continent, and the public called for every specimen to be exhibited. But the
residt has been that, in consequence of the enormous development of our collec-
tions, the attention of the great mass of visitors is distracted by the multitude of
specimens, while the minute characters by which natm-alists distinguish genera

and species are inappreciable to their eyes.

   It was not, however, the unenlightened public only who insisted on this unli-
mited display ; there were also some leading scientific men who called for it, on

the gTound that the curator might be induced to keep specimens out of sight in

order to make use of them for the enlargement of his own scientific reputation

while the scientific public were debarred the sight of them, and that valuable
specimens might thus be kept, as the favourite phrase was, "in the cellars." But
any such imputation would be completely nullified by the plan which I have pro-
posed of placing all the specimens in the scientific collection in boxes or di-awers
appropriated to them, and rendering them thus at once and readily accessible to

students at large.

I may observe that the late Mr. Swainson, who was the first to raise the cry,

lived to find that it was far moi-e useful to keep his own extensive collection of

l)ird-skins in di-awers, like his  butterfiies and  his  shells                              and  that  most  scientific
                                                                                          ;

zoologists and osteologists are now convinced that the skins of animals unmounted

and kept in boxes are far more useful for scientific piu-poses than stuffed skins or

.set-up skeletons.

So  also,   mywith reference to    proposal for  the     aiTangement                              of  the  Museum  for

the general public, I find that those who are desirous of exhibiting their specimens

to the best advantage are generally adopting similar plans.

   Thus, when Mr. Gould determined on the exhibition of his magnificent collec-
tion of Humming-birds, he at once renounced the rank-and-file system, and
arranged them in small glazed cases, each case containing a genus, and each pane

or side of the case showing a small series of allied species, or a family group of a

single species.

  When lately at Liverpool, I observed that the clever curator, Mr. Moore, instead

of keeping a single animal on each stand, has commenced gi-ouping the various
specimens of the same species of Mammalia together on one and the same stand,

as several are gi-ouped in the British Museum, and thus giving far greater interest

to the group than the individual specimens would afford.

In the British Museum, as an experiment with the view of testing the feelings

of the public and the scientific visitors, the species of Nestor Parrots and of the

Birds of Paradise, a family of Gorillas and the Impeyan Pheasants, and sundiy of

the more interesting single specimens, have beeil placed in isolated cases ; and

it may readily be seen that they have proved the most attractive cases in the
Aexhibition.
              series of reptiles and fish, exhibiting the characters of the families

and the more interesting genera, have been stuffed and exhibited, whilst the col-

lection of those animals in spirits and in skins is kept arranged for the use of the

more scientific student.

In the same manner, a series of the skeletons, showing the principal forms of

each class of animals, has been set up, and the remainder of them kept in boxes,
so that a series of the same bone of any number of animals may be laid out for
comparison with either recent or fossU specimens, or to show the form the bone

assumes in the different genera, which it is difficult to see in an articulated

·skeleton.

In the Great Exhibition of 1862, Prof. Hyrtl of Vienna exhibited some framed

cases of skeletons like those here recommended : one contained the typea of each
                                                                                                            ;

family of Tortoises, anotlier the principal forms of Saurians, &c. They exdted

much interest, and some cases were purchased by our College of Sm-geons.

In some of the Continental museums also I have observed the same plan adopted

to a limited extent.

   I now exhibit a case of insects, received from Germany, in which what I have
suggested is fully carried out. You wiU perceive that in one small case are exhi-

bited simultaneously, and visible at a glance, the egg, the larva, the plant on

which it feeds, the pupa, and the perfect moth, together with its varieties, and the

parasites by which the caterpillar is infested. Such cases, representing the entire

life and habits of all the best-known and most interesting of our native insects,

would be, as I conceive, far more attractive and instructive to the public at large

than the exhibition of any conceivable number of rows of allied or cognate species,

having no interest whatever except for the advanced zoological student.

   I will only add that I am perfectly satisfied, fi-oni observation and experience,

and tliat I believe the opinion is rapidly gaining ground, that the scientific student

would find a collection solely devoted to the object of study, and preserved iu

boxes and drawers, far more useful and available for scientific purposes than the

stuffed specimens as at present arranged in galleries of immense extent, and crowded

with curious and bewildered spectators ; while, on the other hand, the general

public woidd infinitely better understand, and consequently more justly appreciate,

a well-chosen and well-exhibited selection of a limited number of specimens,

carefully arranged to exhibit special objects of general interest, and to afford a

complete series for elementary instruction, than miles of glass cases containing'

thousands upon thousands of specimens, all exhibited in a uniform manner, and

placed like soldiers at a review.

The plan has the advantage of being as applicable to a very large as to a small

local collection, for a few well-selected cases of animals of any parish or district

will teach what they have been prepared to illustrate, and the addition of every

well-selected series of specimens will extend the usefulness of the institution, and

the better the animals are known to the visitor, the more is the interest they will

take in the exhibition.

   Specimens are much less liable to injuiy (and this is a great consideration in a

small institution, where onlj' a single curator, often an impaid amateur, is employed)

if they are kept in small well-closed cases, properly pasted up, than if they are

kept in large cases that open, where the air changes with every change of tempe-

rature                          for  the  air is expelled when  the  cases  are  warm,  and  it  rushes in  again,
                             ;

charged with dust and destructive gases, when the air within is cold and contracted.

  --I now turn to a veiy different subject one which has alwa3's occupied a consi-

derable share of my attention, and on which a few observations may not be out of

--Elace on this occasion viz. the acclimatization of animals. This subject, which

as been a favourite one with the more thoughtful student, appears all at once to

have become popular ; and several associations have been formed for the especial

piu^pose of its promotion, not only iu this country, but also on the Continent and

m the Australian colonies.

  I may observe that the acclimatization of animals, and especially the introduction
and cultivation of fish, was among the peculiar objects put forward by the Zoolo-

--gical Society at the time of its foundation, nearly forty years ago although, as we

all know, it has been able to do very little for its promotion.

   It would appear, from observations that are occasionally to be met with in the
public papers and in other journals, to be a prevalent opinion among the patrons of

some of these associations that scientific zoologists are opposed to their views, or,

at least, lukewarm on the subject. But I am convinced tliat they are totally mis-

taken in such a notion, and that it can only have originated in the expression of a

belief, founded on experience, that some of the schemes of the would-be acclima-

tizers are incapable of being carried out, and would never have been suggested if

their promoters had been better acquainted with the habits and manners of the

animals on which the experiments are proposed to be made.

  The term acclimatization has been employed in several widely different senses :--

1st, as indicating the domestication of animals now only known in the wild state

2ndly, to express the introcbiction of the domesticated animals of one country into
                                                                                              TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                  81

another ; 3rdly, the cultication of fishes, Sec, by the restocking of rivers, the colo-

nizcation of ponds, or the renovating of worn-out oyster- or pearl-fisheries by fresh

supplies.

Uomnieuciug with the first of these objects, which is by many regarded as the

most important, I would observe that some animals seem to have been created with

more or less of an instinctive desire to associate vnth. man, and to become useful to

him                       but the number of                                                   these    is very limited,  and as  it  undoubtedly takes    a long
                       ;

period to become acquainted with the qualities and habits of these animals, anS

with the mode in which their services may be rendered available, it would almost

appear as if all the animals which are possessed of this quality, and are worth

domesticating, had already been brought into use. Indeed all tho'se which are now

truly domesticated were in domestication in the earlier historic times. The Turkey,

it may be said, was not known imtU the discovery of America ; but I think it has

been satisfactorily proved that our domestic Turkey is not descended from the wild

Turkey of America, but comes of a race which was domesticated by the Mexicans

before the historic period. Again, the number of such animals is necessarily

limited                               for it is not worth while                                        to  go through    a  long     process of domestication
                                   ;

with the \-iew of breeding an animal that is not superior in some important par-

ticular to those which already exist in domestication. For example, where would

be the utility of introducing other Ruminants which do not breed as freely, feed as

cheaply, afford as good meat, and bear the climate as well as our present races of

domestic cattle ?

   It has been thought that some of the numerous species of African Antelopes might

be domesticated here ; but every one who has eaten their flesh describes it as harsh

and dry, and without fat ; and such being the case (even could the domestication

be eflected, which I very much doubt), such an animal must have some very valu-
able peculiarity in its mode of life, and be capable of being produced at a very cheap

rate, to enable it to take rank in om- markets beside the good beef and mutton with
which they are at present supplied ; and, even supposing it to be semidomesticated

only for the park, it could not for an instant be put in competition with the fine

venison which it is thought that it might displace.

I am aware that certain French philosophers have lately taken up a notion that

it is desirable to pervert the true pm-poses of the Horse by cultivating him for food

instead of                            work                             and                    that  a  society of Sippopliagi has    been  instituted  with  this
                                                                    ;

view. Of course, under present circimistances, the flesh of old and worn-out horses

is sold for much less than that of weU-fed Ruminants ; and the miserable classes in

some countries are glad to obtain animal food of any kind at so low a rate : but
whenever an attempt has been made to fatten horses for food, it has been foimd

that the meat could not be produced at so low a rate as that for which far better

beef and mutton could be bought.

There are also some small semidomesticated animals, such as the Porcupine and

other Glires, which are said to aftbrd good meat ; but they have long been driven

out of the market by the cheapness and abundance of the prolific Rabbit.

With regard to the larger Ruminants (such as the Giraffe, the Eland and some

other foreign Deer, the Llama, and the Alpaca), which have been bred in this

countiy, but never brought into general use, I cannot consider them as at all accli-

matized. They have almost always had the protection of warmed buildings, espe-

cially in the winter                                                                          and though they may have lived through a certain number of
                                                                                           ;

years, they are liable to attacks of diseases dependent upon our climate, and gene-

rally die off before their natural term of existence is completed. I can only regard

them as partially domesticated, and that only as objects of curiosity and luxury, and

85 incapable of being tm-ned, in this country at least, to any useful domestic pui-pose.

   With regard to those animals which may be considered as more or less completely

under the control of Man, there exists considerable ditierence in the natm-e of their

domestication.

The more tj'pical among them, or truly domesticated, such as the Oxen, the

Sheep, the Horse, the Camel, the Dog, and the Cat, like the Wheat and the Maize
among plants, are never found truly wild ; and when thev are permitted to run

wild, as in the case of horses and oxen in South America, thev are easily brought

back to a state of domestication, especially if caught young. What may be called

the semidomesticated or domesticable animals, sucli as the Buffalo, the Goat, the

Pip:, the Rabbit, the Reindeer, the Yak, and some other Asiatic cattle, are foimd

both in the tame and the vnld state, and often in the same region and in close

proximity to each other. The Asiatic Elephant, and a few other animals which

can be made tractable under man's direction, never (or very rarely) breed in

domestication ; and all the individuals of these very useful races are caught wild

and brought into subjection by ti-aining. The African Elephant is evidently equally
amenable to man's conti-ol, and was equally domesticated by the Romans ; but the

negroes do not seem to appreciate the advantages which they might derive from its

domestication, and only make use of its tractable disposition to keep it in captivity

until such time as its ivory is best fitted for the market, when, also, they can feed

upon its flesh.

All om' domestic or semidomestic animals have their proper home in the tem-

perate regions of Europe and Asia. They all, except the Ass, bear great cold bet-

ter than excessive heat ; and even the Ass suffers greatly on the coasts of the
tropics. The Sheep, in the warmer regions, require to be driven to the cool moun-

tains dming the hot season. In the tropics they lose their wool, and, like the long-

haired goats and dogs, change the character of their fur. The inhabitants of the

arctic region or subarctic regions of Eiu'ope and Asia have partially domesticated

the Reindeer.

Either Asiatics have a peculiar aptitude for domesticating animals, or the Rumi-

nants of that part of the world are peculiarly adapted for domestication. In the

moimtain regions of Tibet and Siberia the Yak has been domesticated, and, like the

Reindeer of the arctic regions, it is used as a beast of biu-then as well as for milk

and food. The steppes of Asia are the home of the Camel and the Dromedary. In

the lower and warmer regions of central and southern Asia the Zebu has been

completely domesticated; and the natives of India and of the islands of the Malayan

archipelago have brought into a semidomesticated state various species of wild

cattle, such as the Gyal, the Gour, and the Banting, and have even obtained some

hybrid breeds between some of them and the Zebus, as well as the Buffalo, which

they have in common with Afiica and the south of Europe. In the park of the

Governor-General of India there are large herds of the Black Antelope, the Axis

Deer, and the Porcine Deer in a semidomestic state ; and our officers found in

the park of the Emperor of China at Pekin more than one species of domesticated

Wenative Deer.                                have as yet received from Japan only one peculiar species of

domestic animal, viz. a Pig vntli a plaited face (Stis plicatiis) ; but it is not unlikely

that the Deer called Cervus Sika is a domesticated species, like the Ccrvus Swinhoii

of Formosa. In Celebes there is a small Buffalo called Anoa ; and in the same

island, as well as in Java and some of the other islands of the Indian Ocean, most

of the aboriginal pigs, including the Babirussa, have been more or less completely

domesticated. These numerous instances will suflice to show how largely Asiatics

have been enabled to draw aromid them for additions to then* domestic or half-

domestic races ; but a glance at the habits and manners of most of them will suf-

fice to show how little they would be suited to our more northern climate, and how

small would be the advantage gained were it possible to mtroduce them here.

Africa has only sent to Europe the Guinea-fowl, that vagrant from our farm-

yards                             but it too  has some  domesticated  animals  of  its own.  In the more fertile
                               ;

and well-watered parts of that continent there exist at least five different kinds of

--domestic cattle : the Buffalo {Bos Bithalun) and humpless cattle, which appear to

be of the same species and to be derived ft-om the same som'ce as the Buffalo and

domestic Oxen of Europe. The African Zebu {Bos Dante) appears to be distinct

fi'om the Zebu of India, and is probably an indigenous domestic race ; and the long-

eared bush-cattle, or Zanious {Bos hrachyccros), are certainly an aboriginal species

peculiar to tropical Africa. Besides these, it has, in the Desert regions, the Camel
in common with Asia : this animal is also partially domesticated in the southern

parts of Europe.

Captain Burton observes, "The Negi-o fails in domestication of lower animals,

because he is deficient in forbearance with them ; in a short time his violence will
ruin the temper of a horse, and he will staiTe an English dog for which he has

perhaps paid a high price."

   America had only three or (if we reckon the Dog) at most foiu' domestic animals
belonging to the country before it was discovered by Europeans, who have, how-

ever, since introduced into it most of those which they themselves pre\'iously pos-

sessed. The Turkey was only domesticated by the native Mexicans ; and it may

be observed that in Europe these birds have only been imperfectly natm'alized, re-

quiring peculiar care and attention in their early stages to protect them from the

eft'ects of an imgenial climate. The Llama and Alpaca were also early domesticated

by the native Peru^aaus ; and it would appear as if these animals would not bear
transportation to other quarters. All the attempts, at least, which have hitherto

been made to introduce them into Europe and Australia have resulted in failure.

The Esquimaux inhabiting the more northern regions have a peculiar race of dogs,

which are in the highest degree useful to them ; but it appears to be of the same

original stock with the dogs of Europe, and had probably passed from one continent

to the other.

In some parts of this vast continent, the Oxen and the Horse, since their introduc-

tion from Europe, have so firmly established themselves in a half-wild state as to

be often hunted and killed for their hides alone.

Australia and the islands of the Pacific have no native domestic animals, if we

again except the Dog ; and Australia alone has any mammals sufliciently large

Newto be hunted for their flesh. There formerly existed in      Zealand a large bird

(the Moa) which was eaten by the natives ; but it seems to have been exter-

minated, or nearly so, before the colonization of the islands.

Em-opean animals have been largely and advantageously introduced throughout

the Pacific Ocean, and in some cases have become wild and even dangerous.

As in Europe, all the domestic animals of these various parts of the world

appear to have been brought into their present condition for many ages, inasmuch

as they were all found in a domestic state when the several countries were first

visited by Eiu'opeaus.

   And an attentive study of the list, and of the peculiarities of the animals com-
posing it, induces me to believe that, in attempting to introduce new domestic

animals into some of our colonies, it would be desirable not to confine om'selves to

the Em-opean breeds, but to ascertain whether some of the domestic races of

Asia or Africa might not be better adapted to the climate and other conditions of

the colony, although, for reasons to which I have before adverted, it would

neither be worth the trouble, nor consistent with good policy, to attempt their

introduction here.

There is evidently ample room for such experiments, which might be advan-

tageouslj^ made, for instance, in the colonies of the coast of Africa, where our

horse, ass, oxen, sheep, and goats, and even dogs have gi-eatly degenerated, where

the horse and the ass live only for a brief period, where the flesh of the ox and
sheep is described as bad and rare, and the flesh of the goat, which is more

common, is said to be tasteless and stringy. The pig alone, of all our domestic

animals, seems to bear the change with equanimity ; and the produce of the

"milch pig" is often sold to passengers of the mail packets and the ships on the

stations, as the milk of the cow or even the goat is rarely to be obtained. Unfor-

tunately both the white and the blaclv inhabitants are merely sojourners in the

land, and do not seem to possess sufiicient energy or inclination to make the

experiment themselves.

   Some persons have confounded the collecting of wild animals in menageries
for show, or for the uses of the gladiator, with the acclimatization of them. The

custom of collecting animals for this purpose is coeval with our earliest historical
records. They are to be seen on the monuments of Assyria, Egypt, Rome, and

Mexico ; and the natives of some of the more uncivilized countries exhibit their love

for wild animals, some women even going to the extent of suckling them like, or
even with their children. Some domestic animals, as the Ox, the Cat, and even

wild ones, as the Baboon, are considered as sacred by the Egyptians, Hindoos, and

some of the negroes of Tropical Africa.

Secondly, as regards the introduction of the domestic races of one countiy into

another, there can be no doubt that this is a much more important object in

relation to our Australian colonies, and other settlements planted in waste lands,
                                                                                                     6*

than it is to the old countries, such as all the European states, and that it has

been pursued,  as far as they are  concerned,   with   great                                           success.    Dr.  George

                                                                                                                 _

Bennett, in the third annual ' Report of the Acclimatization Society of New-
WeHolland,' has well observed, "
                                   have lately heard of acclimatization dinners in

London and other places, but a dinner in New South Wales of food naturalized in

the colony occurs every day, and a hner display cannot be surpassed in any

country." Few countries were so badly supplied by nature with useful animals

and plants as the Australian continent ; and while we do not receive in Europe a

single indigenous product for our tables, either animal or vegetable, from Australia,

which in this respect has added nothing to the comfort of civilized man, no country

has been more richly supplied with the useful products of other parts of the world

for not only have the natural productions of the temperate regions of Europe been

largely introduced, but even the flowers and fruits of tropical and subtropical

regions.

   There is no doubt that the introduction into Australia of animals long domesticated
in Europe is far more easy than that of semidomesticated animals from countries in a

ruder state of society. Perhaps this may explain why the leading animals and

plants to which Dr. Bennett refers in this' Report, and which, be it observed, have
all been introduced by individual enterprise, have succeeded so much better than
the later attempts to introduce such animals as the Llama and various ornamental

Mammalia and birds. Among other attempts referred to are the blackbirds,

thrushes, starlings, and skylarks of Europe : these latter seem to be established in

the Botanic Garden, but it is doubtful whether such birds can find their appro-

priate food except in cultivated gardens or near the towns.

   On the other hand, it is to be observed that the inti-oduction into a new countiy

of domestic or semidoniestic animals is not always an unmixed advantage. Thus,

the domestic pig has been completely naturalized in New Zealand : there its great

multiplication has rendered it so mischievous a pest to the sheep-farmer, from its

following the ewes and eating the newly-dropped lambs, that the flock-masters

have been compelled to employ persons to destroy the pigs, paying for their

destruction at the rate of so much per tail ; many thousands are thus destroyed in
a single season. Indeed it has been proved by Dr. Hooker's interesting paper "On
the Replacement of Species," that the introduction of a new animal or plant often

results in its destroying and taking the place of some previous inhabitant, thus

rendering its introduction a matter of doubtful advantage, or at all events a ques-

tion to be approached with considerable caution.
    It is, however, manifest that, on the whole, more useful results are to be

 obtained from the introduction of races already domesticated into countries to

which they have not reached, than from the attempt to acclimatize animals for
the most part either unsuited to the climate or capable only of an inferior degree

 of domestication, or inferior in quality to those which are already in possession of

the ground.

   Under the third head, the cidtivation of fish, I have very little to observe,
although the subject is unquestionably one of gi-eat importance. But as yet we

have very little  practical  information  upon  the  question                                          and I consider that the
                                                                                                    ;

advocates of the system are only for the present feeling their way, as the experi-

ments have not been pursued for a suflicient length of time to produce any posi-

tive or reliable results. To replenish rivers in which the flsh which fornierly

inhabited them have been destroyed, it is necessary closely to study the habits of

the flsh, and to imitate as much as possible their natiu-al proclivities.

Thus, for example, it appears to me that, when attempting to introduce young

artificially hatched fish into a river, we should place them in the smallest stream-

lets, where the fish would themselves deposit their ova, and not in the vvider parts

of the stream, where they are liable to injury from various causes. Again, the

notion of fishing the breeding-fish out of a river, collecting their eggs and artifi-

cially impregnating them, seems to me an unnatural mode of proceeding, and such

as is not practised in the cultivation of any other animal. I cannot see any prac-

tical advantage that can possibly be derived from it.

For the replenishing of worii-out fisheries of oysters and pearl-sliells, all that

seema necessary or advantageous to be done is to place round the bed twigs and
                         TRANSACTIONS 01' THE SECTIONS.                         85

vai'ious similar substances so arranged as to retain the eggs when deposited, and

to protect them by all the means in our power, leaving the beds undisturbed for a
sufhcient time to allow the new brood to become firmly established in them.

   Besides the numerous attempts at home to replenish oiu- rivers and oyster-beds,

much has been written and large sums have been expended in trying to introduce
salmon into the rivers of Australia ; but the many failm'es show how little those
who undertook the task were acquainted with the most common physiological
questions connected with the removal of fish, and how small was their knowledge
of the habits and peculiarities of the fish which they proposed to remove. To show
this, I may mention that they first attempted to send the eggs of salmon to

Australia packed in mass, but they soon rotted. I mentioned during a discussion
on the subject at the Zoological Society, that the eggs would more likely arrive

alive if they were packed in ice (as Dr. Davy had informed me that he had carried
trout alive from the North of England to the West in that way). Some eggs were

sent to Australia so packed in a ship called the ' Beautiful Star,' but. the trans-

myporters had so little faith in  plan that the box was forgotten when the ship

arrived in Australia, and was stumbled on much injured when the ice-house was

visited some time after the arrival of the ship ; fortunately the majority of the eggs
were found alive, and they were the first salmon eggs hatched in Australia.
What, indeed, could be more absm-d than the attempt to introduce salmon into

rivers which, for a considerable part of the year, are reduced to a series of stagnant

pools. I think I may ventm-e to predict that, if ever salmon are introduced into
Australia, they are much more likely to succeed in the deep and rapid rivers of
Tasmania than in the streams of Australia proper. At the same time, when we

consider the very limited geographical range of the salmon in Europe, confined as
it is to those rivers which have their exit into the Northern Seas, that the attempt
to remove it from one river to another in Europe has always been a failure, and

that it is not only necessary that the salmon should have a river similar to that
which it inhabits here, but also the same food and other peculiarities, without
which apparently it cannot subsist, I must confess that I have no great faith in the
success of the introduction of the salmon into Australia. I think, therefore, that it

is to be regretted that the Australian Acclimatization Society do not rather make
some experiments on the introduction of the gouramy, or some of the other edible

fish of countries nearer to and more resembling their own.

   With other members of the British Association, I have received a reprint of the
Rules of Nomenclature drawn up by Mr. Strickland and others, and printed in the

Eeport of the Twelfth Meeting- of the Association (1842), accompanied with a

request to examine them carefully, and to communicate any suggestions to Sir
WiUiam Jardine, Bart.

   I can only repeat the suggestion I made when the rules were under the consi-

deration of the Committee of the Natural History Section of Manchester, viz.,
that the rules be not adopted until they have been compared with Linneeus's
' Philosophia Botanica,' Fabricius's ' Philosophia Entomologica,' Illiger's ' Pro-
dromus,' and DeCandolle's ' ThiSorie Elementaire,' and that when they are not in
conformity with the laws proposed by these authors, which have been accepted

by all recognized systematic natm-alists, the reasons for the proposed alterations

should be given in detail. After some discussion, my suggestion was adopted,

" and they resolved that the Committee of the Section of Zoology and Botany have
too little time during the Meeting of the Association to discuss a Eeport on
Nomenclature, and therefore remit to the Special Committee appointed to draw

up the Eeport to present it on their owm responsibility."
   The rules were mserted in the printed Eeport, through the personal influence of

Mr. Strieldand, who was then a member of the Council, but they never received

the sanction of the British Association.

   In the ' American Journal of Science and Art' for March, 1864 [reprinted in the
'Annals' for June, 18G4,] there are some admirable observations by Dr. Asa Gray

on some of these rides, which entirely accord with my own views, and which I

recommend to the consideration of the Committee.

In conclusiofl, I would request you kindly to bear in mind that I have simply

mythrown these observations together "in the hope of eliciting the opinions of  col-

leagues in the Section.

Notice of some Bare Scotch Plants. By Professor Baifouk, F.B.S., F.L.S.

Some Scotch plants, especially Alpine species, are restricted in their localities

from causes which are as yet imperfectly known. Pecidiarity of soil and exposure

may in some measure accoimt for the restiiction ; hut this does not seem to be
sufficient. Some of the restricted species are common to Britain and Scandinavia

and the moimtaius in southern Em'ope ; and they have been looked upon as out-

posts of a flora which existed in the comiti-y when it was united geologically with

other European countries. The author had lately ^"isited some of the localities

referred to. He exhibited specimens of Sar/ina nivuUs, a Scandinavian plant which

was gathered by himself in Beidawers in 1847, and supposed to be a ^ ariety of Ahine

rtibeila. Mr. Syme, -wdthin the last year, when examining- plants for his edition of

Sowerby's British Flora, happeucd to fall in with some specimens of the above

plant, as gathered by the author, and pointed out that it was a plant new to

Britain. He took occasion to visit Benlawers in August, and he gathered numerous
specimens of the plant. He also foimd it on Biunain, or, as it is sometimes called,

Stobiimain, a moimtain rising to the height of 3800 feet, near Ben More in Perth-

shire, and at the head of the Braes of Balquiddar. This is an interesting addition

to the British Flora. Another station visited was the mountain called the Sow of

Athole, in Invemess-shire, the locality for Phijllodoce ccerulea, one of the rarest

British plants. The plant had been nearly eradicated by a nurservanan many years

ago, and it was feared that it had disappeared ; the plant, howe'\er, still exists on

the hill, although not in large quantitj\ Among other plants confined to single

localities in Scotland he exhibited the following: TJiki^pi alpestre, Canlochan,

form not imlike a cornucopia. In the example under notice, the claw and limb of

each petal are so entirely flat as to give the flower the fonu and appearance of

assimilating itself with clematis, anemone, and others, gives rise to the following

                               Bij Professor BucEMAif, F.L.S., F.G.8.

   The object of this paper was to show that Datura Stramonium and D. Tatula
were identical in points of strncturo, and therefore conld only be considered as
vai'ieties of a single species. That the heightened colour in the flowers, stems,
and leaf-nervures in the D. Tatula, when compared with 2>. Stramojiium, wiU be
a deeper purple in proportion to the warmth of the sununer, the milder climate,
and amount of sun to which it is exposed. That though identical in species, the
fine forms of the D. Tatula, as much as six feet high, are very distinct in medicinal
properties, as indicated by a more powerful smell, and evidenced by the almost
disuse of the D. Stramonium and the increasing emploj-ment of D. Tatula in
asthmatic and chest complaints.

 On, the Decay of Species, and on the Naturcd Provisions for Extending their

  Duration. By Dr. Datjbent, F.E.S., F.L.S., Professor of Botany, Oxford.

   It may be assumed as an acknowledged fact, not only that every organized being

 has a limit assigned to its existence, but also that the species themselves, both in

the animal and vegetable kingdom, wear out after a certain period. But it stiU
remains to be inquu-ed whether there may not be certain natural contrivances for
postponing this inevitable termination to a later period than would otherwise
happen. Confining himself to the vegetable kingdom, the author suggested that
one of these provisions woidd seem to be the introduction of new varieties, which,
by diverging somewhat from the original t^'pe, acquire fresh vigonr, and thereby
tend to prolong the existence of the species from which they are derived. One of
the modes by which this variation in character is secured follows as a consequence
from the mode by which plants are reproduced through the instrumentality of the
'floral organs, by the concm-rent action of which an iudi\-idual, intermediate in

cliaracter between its respective parents, and therefore slightly diverging from
both, is the result ; so that this mode of multiplying the indiidduals of a species

seems to fulfil an important subsidiary end, even in cases where, as in plants of
low organization, the increase of the species is sufficiently provided for by means
of buds. Accordingly plants propagated by cuttings seem in general to adhere
more vmiformly to the same type, and at the same time to be more limited in their
duration than those produced from seeds. But this de^N-iation from the primaeval

t^'pe is still more completely earned out when the poUen of one plant is made to
act upon the embryo of another; and hence may arise those numerous contri-
vances for preventing self-fertilization which Mr. Darwin and others have pointed
out. To the same cause, perhaps, may be owing the increased vigoiu" which a
plant acquires by being removed into a fresh soil, or into a distant coimtry.

!\Iauy, no doubt, will regard it as a sufficient explanation of these facts, to appeal
to the changes produced in the constitution of a plant by such causes, as tending
to multiply the chances of some members of the species becoming adapted to those
alterations in the external conditions which occm* in the course of time, and which
might otherwise have proved fatal to its continued existence. There are, however,
reasons for believing that this solution will not embrace aU the facts of the case,

and that, even when every facility for producing the utmost amount of variation of
which a species is susceptible exists, a period at length anives when a species dies

out, although the climate, soil, and other external conditions continue, so far as

we can perceive, propitious.

                                    By Dr. E. Eiddell.

   The author spoke of the gum as a very excellent substitute for, and quite equal

to, the adulterated or reboiled gutta percha from Singapore. They were indebted

to Dr. Van Hoist, of Amstertlam, Berbice, for brlugiug this gum first to the notice

of the Society of Arts in 18G0. It abounded in the forests of British Guiana, and

was especially prolific at the time of the full moon. On the day of the full moon

the yield of gum was from six to ten times greater than at other limes. After the

tree had been tapped, it was said it could be tapped again every two months. The

wood was used for building purposes and for furniture, and he was informed the

Atree was not injured by being tapped.  tree yielding a gum similar in eveiy re-

spect was discovered to exist, by Gen. CuUen and Col. Cotton, in 1853, grovdng

along the whole line of the Western Ghauts on the Malabar coast, Southern India,

from lat. 8° 30' to lat. 10° 30', at an elevation of from 2.500 to 3000 feet above the

sea. The climate of the countrv' where the bullet-tree is found in Berbice is un-

healthy ; but, however that may be, probably some of the free slaves of America

might be induced to settle there and become traders.

On the Manatus Vogelii. Extract of a Letter to Sir John Eichaedson from

                                                       Dr. Baikie.

   Dr. Baikie is at present trying to get the skeleton of the Ayii, or Manatus

Vogelii, of which Professor Owen described a skull. The true habitat of this

animal is the Niger, below the rapids. Its existence in the upper country, where
Vogel perished, has not been ascertained.

         On an Ancient Cornish Barrow. By C. Spexce Bate, F.R.S.

   This paper refers to a mound in Constantine Bay, in which, on being cut, was

found an irregularly shaped stone covering a pit about twenty inches deep, and
fifteen in diameter. Within this was a rough earthen vase, containing a quantity

of bones, both ^-ase and bones being much broken ; the latter were undoubtedly
human remains. The bones had evidently undergone the action of fire.

 On a Hitman SJmll and the Bones of Animals fonnd ivith Pottery in a Kjok-
      Jcenmbclden on the Coast of Cormvall. By C. Spence Bate, F.R.S.

   The remains were found near the ruins of the ancient church of Constantine, on
the north coast of Cornwall. The bones were those of a sheep, lamb, deer, and roe-
buck. The pottery consisted of three qualities. The author thought there could
be no doubt that a small round islet in the middle of the bay, near the mound, at
one time was a continuation of the sandhills upon the mainland. It was evident,
therefore, that their separation had taken place since the beds of shells and bones
were deposited. This circumstance afforded presumptive eAidence that the site
of the ancient occupation was anterior to the period when the land was swept
away, and that in extent it must have been much greater than at present. From
one extreme point to the opposite these mounds continue for half a mile along the
coast. Taking into consideration that portion which has been washed away, the
author thinks this old shell-mound must have been the site of a very extensive vil-
lage of prehistoric man. The human skull was found not in the shell-bed, but in
the sand a short distance from it.

         Observations on the Spinnerets of Sjpiders. By Eichaed Beck.

   The pui-pose of this paper was to draw the attention of naturalists to the aid
afforded by the binocular microscope in the determination of the external forms
of the spinnerets of spiders, which, when understood, will no doubt supply good
generic and specific characters ; but, to compare the details of their structure, it is
necessary to make camera-lucida sketches from living specimens, and many of these

the author had draAvu to the same scale of 220 diameters. The followiug facts

--alhided to in the paper may he mentioned as of some importance : The generic

differences in the spinnerets relate to the form of the maniniiilre or of the papillfe
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

the specific differences, to the number and arrangement of the papillfe. Difierent

papillaj have distinct functions, which are referable to the habit of the spider. The

features of the inferior mammulse are the most constant, and supply the ordinary

thread and the means for its attachment. The mammulte of the Cinijlonidce would

he more correctly described as seven and not eight in number, and the spines forming

the calamistrmn of this family, as described by I\Ir. Blackwall, are not confined to

two rows merely, but extend over one side of the leg. The superior mammuhe of

APholcus pI>ala>iffioick's have no papillae on them.  spider's Ime is not generally

formed of aggregated threads proceeding from numerous papilla3 ; and should more

than one thread be present, they may be separated. The papillae undergo gi-eat

changes at every moidt, but especially at the last one, when the male loses some

of the more remarkable features, and the female acquires fresh ones, these results

being perfectly consistent with the sexual requirements.

On the Testimony of Local Phenomena io tlie Permanence of Type.

                           By B. Beddoe, M.D.

Oil the Natural History and Cultivation of the Oyster.

                    By Feank BrcKLAND.

The author began by stating that a new phase was now presenting itself in the

study of natural history, viz. its application to practice ; it costs just as much time and

labour to examine useless things, as things which woidd be commercially beneficial

to mankind, such as the salmon, the oj'ster, the herring, the sole, the turhot, &c.

That it is, moreover, profitable to cultivate the waters he showed by instancing the

Ta3', the rent of which was said to be £15,000 per aunimi, and of the Spaj^, which

produced £12,000 worth of saliuon annually. Calculations he had made showed that

the trawling-gTound in the North Sea was worth tenpence the square acre, and that

the Bay of Gahvay was worth more per acre than the land surrounding it. Having

heard that there had been a general failure of spat this year on the English coasts,

he had travelled over a large extent of seaboard to see if he could ascertain the cause

but the whole thing was enveloped in mystery. He then went, in company with

his friend, T. Ashworth, Esq., to the He de Re, near La Rochelle, where the breeding

of oysters has been carried on so successfully for the last five years. He paid a high

compliment to the sagacity and perseverance of Dr. Kemmerer, resident physician

in the island, the statistics of which in wine, salt, and oysters he (Mr. Buckland)

had tahidated ; and to M. Boeuf, a stonemason, who was the first to hit off the me-

Hethod of cultivating oysters ai-tificiallj'.  then traced the oyster's history from its

birth upwards, describing the mode in which the mother ejects the young in clouds

like fine dust, and the perUs and troubles to which the young and delicate creatures

are subjected during the few days they had to swim about and amuse themselves

hefore they became permanently settled for life ; for, when once fixed to an object,

they were never able again to change quarters afterwards. It has been said that

it was impossible to cultivate oysters ; but to prove that it was done in the He de

R^, he had brought over witnesses in the shape of tiles, stones, broken bits of pot-

tery, and even glass, to which oysters had attached themselves, like grapes, in large

bunches. All these were explained, and reasons given why the oysters chose one

-- --place and not another, why they died here, and lived there, and elucidated prin-

ciples which he earnestly requested the audience to remember, as there could not

be too many observers in this most important branch of natural industry, which he

trusted would be shortly applied to British shores. With regard to tlie failure of

spat this year, which was so general that it extended even partially to the He de

Re, he stated that hitherto the attention of scientific men had not been directed to

the point. An event, moreover, which the Ladies would appreciate, had taken place

in Ceylon, viz. the sudden death, fi'om imknown causes, of whole baidis of the

pearl-bearing oysters, the consequence of which would be Ihat the price of pearls

would be enormously increased. He concluded by stating that, in consultation
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

witli the learned and energetic Prof. Coste and other French Government officers,

-- --Dr. Graumiout, M. Gerbe, M. Tayeau, M. Bourie, and Dr. Kemmerer, he had

submitted tive principal causes of the failure of the young oysters in England and
France. To these all had agreed ; still there must be other causes as yet to be dis-
covered ; and he trusted this important national subject would be earnestly taken
up by the numerous talented and highly scientific members of the British Associa-

tion who were then present.

       On Sahnon-liatcMng and Salmon-ladders. By Feaitk Buckland.

 --The author said Whereas the oyster is stationary, and is treated in its cidtiva-

tion more like a mineral than an animal, the salmon is literally a vagabond, always
on the move, and never remains long together in the same place. Upon this fact
depend its preservation and multiphcation, in spite of the many difficulties it has

--to contend with, the gi-eatest enemy being man. The conditions of a good salmon
--fishery are three : 1, the sea ; 2, a river; 3, mountainous or hilly country. From

careful observation of geological causes, especially of the watersheds of rivers, the

elevations of land, it might be determined whether a river was or was not siutable
for salmon. Such was the mar-sellous instinct which compelled the salmon to run
up from the sea to the elevated gi-ound fit for spawning, that the salmon caught at
the mouth of the Rhine, and which are sold in the London market, run up that
river no less than 630 miles to their spawning-ground, and, of course, 630 miles

back again. Thus we may fairty conclude that a fish weighing twenty pounds has
travelled in its journeys up and down the river no less than 6000 miles. The sal-
mon hatched in the upper waters of the Rhine are caught at Rotterdam, where

there are five fishing-stations : the annual produce of these fisheries is said to be
200,000 fish, which, calculated at Is. 6(/. per poimd, woidd amoimt to an immense

sum of money. These salmon are, howe'N'er, stopped in their upward progi-ess by
the falls of Schatt'hausen, and it was a gi-eat pity that some arrangement was not
made to allow them to get up. The fish had Aery rapid currents to contend with,
and at the mouth of the Rhine they were caught vnih. gigantic nets that were
payed out by a steamboat, and haided ashore by horse-power. He then gave rea-
sons why artificial hatching of salmon should be encouraged. First, because it
might be said that the salmon did not know their oyni business, and were very bad
um'ses ; for it has been calculated on excellent data, that out of one thousand yoimg
ones only one ever became human food. Salmon made their nests in the gravel
one over the other, heaping up immense mounds, so that the bottom eggs woidd of

necessity be crushed, and only those near the top ever hatch out. Secondly, there

Avere so many enemies of the salmon, both when in the form of an q^'^ and in the
foi-m of a yomig fish, that they reqidred presen-ation and careful watching, like

young pheasants. Severa-1 of these enemies were enumerated, and a good Avord

said for the water-ouzel, who eats, not the salmon-eggs, but the insects that come

to feed on the eggs. Artificial breeding had restored salmon to the Thames, for
his esteemed and persevering friend Stephen Ponder, Esq., of Hampton near
Hampton Court, had for the last three years, in his piivate greenhouse, been hatch-
ing out many thousands of salmon and trout, and turned tliem into the Thames.
The consequence is that in the shallow waters aboAe Hampton Court, great num-
bers of young salmon and trout, from 1 to 5 inches long, could be seen any fine

sunny morning. AU this was done on behalf of the Thames Angling Preseryation
Society, to whom the City of London had intrusted the twenty -two miles of this

noble HA'er, for the benefit of all anglers with rod and line ; no netting, except for
bait, being allowed. It was still a question what woidd become of these salmon
but in 1866 the main drainage Avoidd be finished, and then they wovdd have a chance
of retm-ning fi-om the sea. It had been stated that the French piscicultural esta-
blishment at Himingue, over which his friend M. Coumes, the eminent French
Government Engineer, presided, was retrogi-ading ; but he could state that this year
more than one million sahnon-eggs had been collected, and a large proportion distri-

buted gi-atiutously all over France, and also to many parts of England. The laws for
the protection of fish in France were deficient ; but M. Coste had informed him that
a new laAv woidd be proposed next season enabling him to shut up the fishery,
and preserve the fish of any river in France for three years. The salmon-laws in

Eu"land aflbrded protection for the fish ; and his friend, Mr. Ffennel, Inspector of
Fisheries, was always busy in obtaining facts, which yroidd enable him to gain

knowledge on which the laws for the futiu-e should be amended and regidated. He

had tided last year to obtain a hybrid between a salmon and a trout, and had been

much laughed at for his pains. Still he was pleased to inform the meeting that

Thomas Gamett, Esq., of Clitheroe, had succeeded, not only this year, but also. in

pre\-ious years ; and this gentleman was the first in England to obtain success in

this cm-ious experiment. M. Coste had moreover shown him, a few days since, in

Paris, several specimens of hybrids between salmon and trout, and also one between

the trout and the " ombre chevalier," or chaiT, the latter being a most curiously

striped fish. M. Coste had also shown fish hatched from the' eggs of a salmon

which had neve)- been to the sea, having been confined aU its life in a freshwater pond,

proving that even though salmon do not thrive without going to the sea, still they

will carry eggs capable of producing young. Upon the subject of salmon -ladders

Mr. Buckland was very earnest, pointing out that it was not only cruel, but exceed-

ingly short-sighted policy not to assist the salmon to get to the 'upper waters to lay

their eggs                                         it was just the same as  not  putting a ladder  to                                                                                                                                                                                  allow the  hens to get
                                                ;

Howup to their roosts.                             could salmon be expected to get over a wall any more

than a human being, imless a ladder were provided for either fish or man ? So
with the sahnon-ladders. He then explained other difficulties, particularly that

of finding a gi-atiug to prevent salmon swimming up mill-races, and getting injured

by the mill-wheels. No grating had hitherto'been invented which at the 'same

time would prevent the salmon rumiing up and not lead back the water on to the

--wheel and stop its action. Mr. Buckland concluded his paper as follows : " Thus,

then, I have endeavoured to bring before the members of the British Association

--certain facts relative to two great branches of British industn' the cultivation of

the sea and the cultivation of the rivers ; the revenues derived li-om these, both to

private owners and to the public ia general in the form of food, would, if put toge-

ther, amoimt to an enormous sum, and still neither industry is as vet half developed.
As regards the artificial hatching of oysters, so that they shoijd be taken inland

like the salmon, the question presents enormous ditficulties                                                                                                                                                                                                                           the question of space,

tlie quantity of water required, the temperature, and many other conditions are as

yet imdetermined, and I see at this moment a mountain of 'difficulties before me. I

have, however, taken my staff" in hand, and am preparing to ascend that mountain,
at aU risks. I am anxious, therefore, to bring the results of many hundred miles of

tra\el and of many weeks of out-of-door observations in England, Ireland, and

France, before the British Association, in order that the scientific men of England

-- --may know that the investigation into the habits and improvement of these two

creatures the salmon and the oyster is no mere child's play nor shnply amuse-

ment, but, on the contrary, the very foundation-stone of a \eiy" large and important

British industry, to which the experienced minds of scientific men have onlv to be

directed in order to produce great and beneficial good to the public, and especially

to the poorer classes of society."

               On a very Ancient Human Cranium from Gibraltar.

                               Bi/ G. Btjsk, F.B.S., Sec. L.S., F.G.S.

   The cranium that formed the subject of this communication was found in a
quan-y situated under the north face of the Rock of Gibraltar; and from the
matrix with which it was thickly covered, and which contained a very large pro-

portion of coarse rolled sUiceous sea-sand, similar to that whicli is blown up in such

large quantities against the north-eastern end of the rock, it was apparent that it
had been lodged in the superficial part of the talus hi which the quarry is worked.
The remarkable form of the cranium, resembling that of tlie one foimd in the
Neauderthal Cave, was described, together with the pecidiar confonuation of the
face and jaw apart, which is wanting in the latter.

   The general appearance and condition of the bone showed that it was of great

antiquitv, but from the absence of any associated remains, and of very precise
infoi-mation as to the site in which it was discovered, it was impossible 'to assign
any approximate period to it.
                                                                        ;

--92 REPORT 1864.

   The paper eoucluded with a comparison of the various proportions of the
cranium with those of the intertrojjical negro, Australian, and Tasmanian races,
and it was thence concluded that, of these tliree types, it most nearly corresponded
with the Tasmanian, and with certain tribes of Western Australia, which are
usually distinguished by the gi-eat comparative lowness of the skull, which was

considerably less than the breadth.

Contributions to the Anatomy of the Quadrumana, tvith a Comparative Esti-

   mate of the Intelligence of the Apes and Monlceys. By Edwajids Ckisp,

    M.D.

   This paper was illustrated by a large number of drawings and preparations, the

object being to show the diflerence between the structure of Man and the Qua-

drumana. The tympanic bones of Man, the Gorilla, the Chimpanzee, and Orang
were exhibited. The bones of a large Orang, brought from Borneo by the late Sir

Stamford RatHes, the height of the animal being about four feet, whilst the
expanse of the arms from tip to tip of the longest finger was seven feet eleven
inches ; the very thick pad at the flexures of the fingers and toes in this old
animal was also pointed out, as was the twisted form of the gall-bladder in the
Chimpanzee and Orang. The more rounded form of the eyelids, the absence of
the pearly white of the eye, the gTeat length of the spinous processes of the

Anumber of rings in the trachea, and many other characters were alluded to. com-

parison was {ilso made between the diseases of man and of the quadrumanous

animals, the author drawing his deductions from an examination of ten anthropoid
apes, and 210 monkeys of various species that died in confinement in this country.

In many respects it was inferred that the character of disease differed materially
in these brutes fi-om that obsened in the human family. The presence of an
OS penis both in the Chimpanzee and Orang (not mentioned at the Meeting),
discovered by the author, is considered a great mark of inferiority as regards
position in the animal scale. As regards the intelligence of the anthropoid
apes, the author thought that it was inferior to that of many of the lower

--monkeys, and in many respects to that of the dog and the elephant. The

conclusions were as follows : 1. That tlie anthropoid apes, both anatomically and
in reference to their amount of intelliofence, are not entitled to the elevated
position in which they have been placed Iby some anatomists. 2. That the line of

demarcation between man and these brutes is so wide and clearly defined as to
entitle the human family, as maintained by Blumenbach, Cuvier, and others, to a

separate and exclusive division in the animal scale.

On the Anatomy of the Struthionidtc, Ostriches, Rlieas, and Casuaries.

                    By Edwaeds Crisp, M.D.

In this group of birds the author pointed out, from his own dissections of the

Ostrich (Struthio camelus), Rhea Americana, II. Dartcinii, the Casuaiy (^S.

Emucasuarius), the  (C. f/ahatus), the Moruk (C. Benncftii), and the Double-

wattled Casuary (C. bicarunculafxs), the great and important difterences in the

visceral anatomy of these birds, more especially as regards the length of the

alimentary canal, the character of the gizzard, the CECcal appendages, and the

intestinal mucous apparatus. Thus, in the adult Ostrich, the intestinal tube,

including the appendages, measured 70 feet 6 inches ; that of the JRhea Atnericana,

15 feet 11 inches ; of the Casuary, 14 feet 8 inches ; of the Emu, 13 feet 4 inches

--of the Moruk, G feet 7 inches ; of the Double-wattled Casuary, 8 feet, the length,

as in nearly all animals, depending somewliat upon the age of the bird. The Ostrich

had a very thick and heavy gizzard, that of the Rhea was much smaller, whilst

the gizzards of the other members of this group were comparatively thin.

  A paper was appended fi-om Mr. Bartlett, of the Regent s Park Gardens, showing

that the Ostrich and Rhea had yellow or yellowish-white eggs, whereas the

Casuary, Emu, and Moruk had green eggs. The feathers of the Ostrich and

Bhea were single, whilst those of the Casuary, Emu, and Moruk had two feathers
from each quill. The Apteryx, another member of this ftimily, laid a white egg,
the weight of the bird being GO ozs., that of the egg 14 ozs., forming the most

remarkable example in oology of the large size of the egg as compared to that of
the bird.

On the MoUusca of Bath, and an account of Parasites found in Anodon
                               cygnea. By J. E. Daniel.

   The Bath Natural History and Field Antiquarian Club had in^·ited the anther
to prepare a list of the niollusca found in the vicinity of the city. The list con-
tained ninety species, included in twenty-eight genera. The Anodonta found in

the canals in the neighbourhood present objects of great interest in the parasites

with which they are infested. The number of animals' found in Anodon cyipiea
varies from about live up to as many as tlm-ty. The parasites found in Anodon
a7iatina are not so numei-ous, and they vary slightly in form, are darker and not
so brilliant, and the abdomen is longer and not so tumid. The author had seen an
entozoon living within the fleshy parts of the branchite, which may possibly be the
laiTa of which the parasite before described may be the imago.

Some Observations on the Sahnonidce, chiefly relating to their Generative

                     Power. By John Davt, M.l)., F.R.S., Sfc.

   In this communication the author first noticed the remarkable fact that the
young salmon, the male in its parr-stage, has its testes fidly developed, and that

--its milt is shed before it becomes a smolt and leaves the river for the sea a fact

the more remarkable, as the female of the same age has the ovaries undeveloped,
merely in a rudimentary state.

   He next considered the question whether the sea-trout and the common trout

resemble the salmon as to the preceding peculiarity of function in the young fish.

From his own observations, the conclusion he has arrived at has been in the

aflannative as regards the former, and the negative as regards the latter.
   Thirdly, he ottered some remarks on the age at which the salmon and sea-trout

begin to breed, adoptiug the commonly received opinion as well proved, that the
salmon spawns on its first retm-n from the sea as a giilse ; but, contrary to what
is supposed, that the sea-trout does not spawn untH after a second retm-n from

the sea.

   Fourthly, he adverted to the question of the spawning of the Salmonidre,
whether yearly or only in alternate years, stating facts which had come under his

own knowledge, inducing him to iufer that all the several species, \\z. the salmon,
sea-trout, common trout, and charr, have a fallow season, and that the fish of each

kind called barren are examples of this rest of the generative organs.

   He concluded with some remarks on the interesting subject of the differences

exhibited by the nearly allied species of the Salmonidffi, all of which have at least
one quality in common, viz. that their ova cannot be hatched except in fresh
and well aerated water, leading, as he thinks, to the inference that the migi-atory
species have always been migratorj', unless indeed the seas were at one time less
salt than at present, and the lakes and rivers less fresh, and that then the habits
of the fish might have been formed, and they might gradually have become divided
into the migratoiy and non-migratory species.

                       First Steps towards the Domestication of Animals.

                      By F. Galton, F.E.S., F.G.S., FE.G.S.

  A large mimber of instances were adduced from all parts of the world to show

that savages were addicted to making pets of animals, and the author concluded

that almost every animal had been frequently captured and tamed by them. He

also showed, from the histories of all the earlj^ monarchies, that it was customary

for kings to exact, and for barbarians to give, enormous numbers of wild animals

as tribute. The amphitheatrical displays of Rome made a similar demand on an

immense scale. Hence every animal appears to have been freqiiently under the
power of man ; but only a very few of them have proved capable of permanent
                                                                                 ;

--domestication. The requisite qualities for domestication were separately discussed

tliey were stated as follows : 1, they should be hardy ; 2, they should have an

inborn  liking for  man                      3, they should be comfort-loving ;  4, they shoidd be fomid
                                          ;

useful to the savages ; 5, they should breed freely ; 6, they should be gi'egarious.

He believed that nearly eveiy animal had had its chance of being domesticated, and

that almost all of those which fulfilled the above conditions were domesticated long

ago. It would follow as a corollary to this, that the animal creation possesses few,

if any, more animals worthy of domesticaticm, at least for such purposes as savages

cared for. These qualities would be intensified by imintentional " selection : " the

wildest members of eveiy flock would escape ; the wilder of those that remained

--would be selected for slaughter. The tamest cattle those that kept the flock
--together, and led them homewards would be preserved alive longer than the

others. It is, therefore, these that woidd chiefly become the parents of stock, and

bequeath their domestic aptitudes to the future herd. He did not believe that the

first domestication of any animal, except the elephant, implied a high ciA-ilization

among the people who established it. He could not believe it to have been the

result of a preconceived intention, followed by elaborate trials, to administer to

the comfort of man. Neither could he think' it arose from one successful eflbrt

made by an individual, who might thereby justly claim the title of benefactor to

his race ; but, on the conti-ary, that a vast number of half-unconscious attempts

have been made throughout the com-se of ages, and that idtimately, by slow

degi'ees, after m:iny relapses and continued selection, our several domestic breeds

became firmly established.

Essential Points of Difference between the Larytvc of the Negro and that of the
    White Man. Bi/ George DrxcAir Glbb, M.'A., M.D., LL.D., F.G.S.,

    F.A.S.

   The author had examined the laiTnx of the negro in the clt^ad and living, in fifty-
eight instances, and the result justified him in aiTi'\"ing at certain conclusions, "to
be confiiTued or modified by further experience. These were the almost invaiiable
presence of the cartilages of Wrisberg, which were either quite rudimentary or
absent in the white race, with some rare exceptions ; they are present in the old
and young of both sexes in the negi-o, probably more fully developed in the prime
of life. Their general presence in the negro, and their absence or rudimentary
condition in the white race, prove them to be charactei-istic of the fomier. The
true vocal cords in the negro, instead of being horizontal and nearlv in a plane

--with the general .strike of the floor of the ventricles a charactenstic almost never
--varying in the white race are i-epresented by an oblique incline fi'om within out-

wards, that is, their internal free border is elevated at a higher angle than their
external or attached border, thus giving to each vocal cord a slanting or shehing
direction outwards and downwards. This obliquitj- of the cords varies in degree
aud extent, but can be generally distinguished ; the contrast, however, is strildng

between the flat horizontal smface and the oblique. In the white man the ven-

ti-icle of Morgagni is situated external to, but immediately above, the plane of the
true vocal cords ; wliilst in the negro, a long and narrow elliptical opening is seen
leading downwards and outwards into the ventricle, the whole extent of whicli to
its veiy fundus is visible in most black people. The change of position iji the
ventricle is most striking, for it hangs sidewise on the outer side of a shelving
vocal cord, not unlilte the saddle-bags on the side of a mule. The relative position
of the thyro-arj-tenoid muscles is necessarily altered by the last-named condition.
These facts the author brought forward regardless of any theoi-v, and with no
other object in view than to advance our knowledge of the anatomy of parts here-

tofore inaccessible to vision in the living. He had prepared, in a tabidar fonu, all

his examinations of black people, with the dates, countiy, and other points of
interest, and the facts made out were explained by reference to large diagram.s.

                   On the Food of Birds. By C. Ottlet Groom.

   The author exhibited tables of the food eaten by each bird, and showed that it

varied very much, according to the season of the year. He had arrived at the
conclusion that it was wise to protect insectivorous birds. Mr. Groom admitted

that the buds of some trees were sometimes destroyed, but asserted that it was only
when the birds were in search of a more destructive gi-ub that lay concealed
within these buds.

                        On the Pedicellarice of the Echinodermata.
                   By W. Bird Herapath, 31.D., F.R.S. L. 4' E.

   These remarkable forceps-like bodies have not received that attention from micro-

scopists which their beauty and peculiarities demanded, and many observers have
wholly mistaken their significance, as even the names by which they are Iniown

bear witness. Pedicellus originally meaning a little louse or parasite, it is evident
that these bodies were formerly considered parasitic to the animals on which they

were found, and of independent vitality.
   The pedicellarise of some Echinoderms (more especially Urasfer rithens, Echinus

--sphcBva, and Amphidotiis communis) have been partially described, and incor-

rectly figured by various observers Midler, Sars, Mum-o, Oken, and Sharpey.
Miiller appears to have first given them the name by which they have been
hitherto known, and he conceived them to be parasitic animals, which opinion
Lamarck, Cuvier, and Schweigger more or less adopted ; but Munro, Oken, and

Sharpey regarded them as organs of the animal, of whose purj^ose and function we
as yet know nothing. It appears to be generally established as a fact that the

pedicellariffi continue their movenieuts even hours after the animal has been
crushed to pieces, and to all appearance dead yet such apparently independent

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

movements cannot be satisfactorily adduced at the present day as evidence of
individual vitality, as the existence of such involuntary motions in the lower

animals, depending on muscular irritability and reflex excito-motory actions, are

well known to all physiologists, whilst even the leg of a man has been observed to

move vigorously some time after amputation.
   Some naturalists of distinction have so far mistaken these peculiar bodies as to

describe one valve of a peculiar pedicellaria as " a microscopic marine mammalian

jaw," from its remarkable similarity in form to the cranium of an animal.

   With regard to the probable nature of the pedicellarias, a growing feeling has
arisen amongst naturalists that they are organs peculiar to the animals upon which

they are found, and that, like the bird's-head forceps on the Polyzoa, they were
organs of defence or prehension, which, although not absolutely necessary to the
existence of the Eehinodei-m, were yet as peculiar and special to the genus, and

even indicative of the species, as the ibrni of a tooth or the character of a bone. It

will be seen from these numerous photographs that these views are well supported

by examples, and that whilst gi'eat general resemblance ia form may be traced

to the pedicellaria3 of the various species comprising the genus Echinus, yet there

are many which are capable of recognition as being indicative of the species, and

totally different from tnose of the genus Amjihidoius, Spatangus, or Urader, -with

which they may be compared ; so that the author has no hesitation in stating,
that in the same way that an animal may be recognized by its tooth, or an Echinus

by its spine, it woiild be equally possible to assert positively that a certain pedi-
--96 REPORT 1864.

cellaria belonged to Urader glacialls, to Echinus sphcera, or to Ampliidotus com-

munis. Further, that although the general form of pedicellarise of Uraster ruhens

presents great similarity to those of U. (jlacialis, and tliose of Echinus miliuris agree

rem.arkably in character with those of E. lividus or E. sphcera, yet there are abun-

dant differences and peculiarities in their appearance to indicate to the practical

eye to what particular species it may belong. The author has hitherto found only

pedicellariaj in the genera Uraster, SpatanguSy Amphidotus, and Echinus, having

examined many other genera of Echinodermata for them ineffectually, more espe-

cially Comatula, Ophiocoma, and the Ophiuridfe. Amongst the family of the

j\.steriadiB, the genera Crihella, Palmipes, Solaster, Goniaster, Luidia, Aster ia,

and Asterina are apparently equally deficient in true pedicellarife. Amongst the

EchinidfG, the author has had no opportunity of examining Cidaris, Echino-

vi/amus, Echinarachnitts, or Amphidotus roseusj consequently he can give no definite

opinion on these genera or species ; but he thinks it probable that the latter at

least may possess these pedicellarial organs. The Holotliuriadag, together with the

otherCirrhovermigradeEchiuodermata, also want pedicellarite ; for it is here scarcely

necessary to remark, that the calcareous spicules and perforated plates existing in

these Echinoderms are the analogues of the pentagonal plates constituting the

shell of the Echini, whilst the oral tentacles are quite free from calcareous appen-

dages. In the genus Si/napta, the perforated plates and anchor-shaped appendages

may possiblj^ be thought to bear some nearer resemblance to pedicellarite ; but a

closer inspection of these peculiar bodies will convince lis that these perforated

plates are also the analogues of the pentagonal plates of an Echinus-shell, whilst

the anchors are merely nioditications of the spines, and are used as organs for pre-

hension or locomotion, and assist the animal in raising its vermiform body to the

mouth of its tube, the anchors being withdrawn during the period of contraction

of the Synapta, and contribute little or nothing to the powers of defending the

animal from the attacks of its predatory enemies. It will be seen that the pedi-

cellarife of the genus Uraster have been well illustrated in two individual species,

Uraster rubens and U. glacialis, and that they are very different in form from

those of the genera Spatangus, Amphidotus, and Echinus, all of which possess pedi-

cellarite consisting of three calcareous blades, while the Urasters have invariably

two blades in each pedicellarial head. Amongst the Echini, the species miliaris,

sphcera, Flemingii, lividus (two varieties), and neglectus have furnished numerous

illustrations, and an Echinus from the Mediterranean has also been examined, the

pedicellaria; of which were also so closely analogous in form to those of the Biitish

neglectus that the author was fully prepared to tind that a comparison of its other

those  of  that  species would couhrm            their  identity                                        and it subse-
--characters -with                                                                                   ;

quently did so without a.'oj possible doubt an instance which may be considered

the strongest possiljle proof of the truth of the proposition, " that the forms of

the pedicellarise are peculiar to the species."

All pedicellarife agree in having a calcareous framework of great beauty, con-

sisting of several pieces united together, and covered by a fleshy, sensitive, mus-
culo-membranous envelope, continuous with the common integument of the animal.

The pedicellariiTB on the genera Amphidotus, Spatangus, and Echinus possess, in

addition, a calcareous style or stem, which is also covered by a prolongation from

the skin or gelatinous envelope of the animal ; and the basal end of the style is

enlarged for articulation with a small knob or elevation upon the shell, adapted to

its reception in a ball-and-socket-like movement. Few objects are of greater

beauty than the pedicellarine of the Echinodermata, as the highly reticulated cha-

racter of the structure, the brilliant transparency of the ciystalline substance, and

sparkling gem-like elegance fully testify. But all these characters may be elicited

by ordinary examination in the microscope with transmitted, reflected, or oblique

rays falling upon them. Yet the highly doubly refracting properties of carbonate

of lime or Iceland spar, of which they are composed, make them still more lovely

objects when they are examined by polarized light and the selenite stage, but

without the analyzing crystal above the eye-piece : imder these circumstances the

pedicellarite themselves become their own analyzers by double refraction, and the

transparent colourless valve of pedicellarite becomes either red or gi-een, blue or

yellow, according to the thickne.?.? of the selenite plate beneath them. Some Echini,
       TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.     97

as E. lividus and E. neglectus, are well supplied witli a deep purple colouring-matter,
which gives a beautiful tiuge to the spiues, which is not removed upon boiling in
strong ley. The pedicellariae imder these circumstances also possess the purple
tint of the spines, the colouring-matter existing in some sort of combination with
the crystalline carbonate of lime. These coloured objects remind one of brilliant
sapphire gems, profusely decorating the wondrously constructed Echinoderm, less
costly and far more elegantly cut than the far-famed jewels of Her Majesty, but
destined to be hidden in the dark abyss of ocean's depths, until brought to light by
the researches of the naturalist, and rendered evident by the lenses and mirrors of

the microscopist. When it is desirable to examine the movements of these organs,

it is advisable to remove a portion of a living animal, and insert it in a small

trough of sea-water, and watch the pedicellariie mth a low-power objective upon the

stage of the microscope. But when it is only desired to examine the structure of the
pedicellariffi, it is better to remove the organ with a scissors or small forceps, and

having placed it on a slide with a small quantity of glycerine containing a little
caustic potass, shortly the musculo-membranous indusium becomes transparent, if
not dissolved, and all the calcareous elements become apparent, but stiU not suffi-
ciently clear for photographic purposes. Under these circumstances, it is necessary
to boil up each animal in distilled water containing a tolerable quantity of caustic
potass, which dissolves all the fleshy coverings, and the calcareous pieces are

made clean and transparent ; in many instances, if the boiling has been care-

fully stopped at the proper time, the two or three blades constituting the forceps-

like appendage remain in conjunction, and are then very much more instructive

preparations to the microscopist. In order to remove these pedicellariee from the

other calcareous debris of the Echinoderm, it is necessary to allow all matter to
subside, and decant the supernatant alkaline solution ; and, having removed all
traces of potass by frequent washing and subsidence with successive portions of
distilled water, it only remains to agitate the whole well together with a steady
circular motion, and, after some moments' repose, pour ofl" the supernatant water,

which contains the pedicellarial blades in suspension ; on repose, these subside,

and may be then removed by a dropping-tube, placed on a slide, dried, and
mounted in Canada balsam in the usual way. The objects now exhibited in

photographs have all been so prepared by the author himself, and are, conse-
quently, authentic specimens, and have all been photographed to one scale for
comparison with the same lens and camera. They are under the same identical

circumstances in each particular case, so that relative size may be taken into
consideration as one of the elements of difference. The writer then went on to
describe the different specimens of which he exhibited photographs, many hundred

examples of which were prepared for comparison.

On the Genus Synapta. By W. Bied Herapath, M.D., F.R.S. L. 6f E.

Having shown the paucity of information which existed in this country on

the Synapta, the author next proceeded to refer to descriptions which had been

given by different scientific men. M. Quatrefages, he said, had described a Sy~

napta which he had foimd on the shore of the Chanssey Islands, a point off" St.

Malo, on the French coast, in the Channel, and he had entered minutely into the

anatomy and physiology of the animal, and his paper was most exhaustive of the

subject. There was also an admirable paper by Messrs. Woodward and Barrett on

the Synapta diyitata and Synapta inhcerem in the Quarterly Journal of the Zoological

Society for 1858. Other authorities mentioned by the author were Professor

WyvUle Thompson and M. Gallienne. The latter had, in the autumn of 1863,

when he was in Guernsey, kindly shown him the locality and mode of finding a

Synapta, which he thought to be inhmrens, and had discovered in Bellegrave Bay,

on the coast of Guernsey. Having visited the spot where M. Gallienne had

obtained his specimens, they found several, a little below low-water level at

spring tides, in a bed of sand about ten or twelve inches deep, and congTegated in

a space about twenty yards square, whence they were easily obtained by digging

cautiously with a spade, the operator being guided in the task by the appearance

of the funnel-shaped openings in the sand, mai-king the position of their burrows.

On inserting the spade and elevatinog it q-xuicklyJ,, the sand generally cracked

through the centre of their perpendicular burrows, disclosing the animal in the
canal, which appeared destitute of all lining material. The identity of the animal
was readily foimd from its quickly adhering to the fingers by its anchor-shaped

booklets. Its appearance when placed in sea-water was at once indicative. It
was a delicate rosy-pink colour, and having five white bands arranged lengthwise
throughout the body from the oral to the anal apertm-es. The mouth was sur-

roimded by a ring of twelve tentacles, which were pinnated, and appeared to have

six pinna3 on each side, with one terminal digit, thirteen pinnse in all. Some of

these animals were distended with sand, and appeared darker in colour, but the
anal extremity was generally enlarged, more transparent, and of the usual pink
colour, from being inflated with sea-water. That distention was the means of
retaining the animal in its buiTOw, by giving it a fixed fidcrum for the contraction
of the longitudinal muscles. The sand bank was dark in colour, and foetid, fi-om
the large quantity of decaying animal matter therein. The Sijnapta doubtless fed
upon that refuse material by gorging itself with sand fi-om time to time. The
author said that the position of St/napfa in the zoological scale, keeping stiictly to
the method of arrangement adopted by Professor Forbes, should be removed from
the Holothuriadfe and placed in the Vermigrade oi-der, as no pedal rows of ambu-
lacral cirrhi existed, and there were no appearances of any protrusile branchial

organs. The author concluded that the Guernsey St/napfa was a new species, being
distinguished by the preceding zoological characters, and by the peculiarities of the

anchors and the anchor-plates, which have the follomng characters :
   Anchor-plates ovate, shaped with a process or arch, each plate being concavo-

convex like a spoon, having serrated external margins when perfect, and one

central round apertiu'e with seven oval openings surrounding it, and two or three
oval apertm'es at the junction of the arch ; the lesser end of plate minutely

perforated.

   Anchors serrated, occasionally plain ; three to seven serrations, with the flukes
reflexed; anchors longer than bucklers, to which they are articulated at the lesser
end of the plate, and upon its concave aspect. The anchors are generally elevated
at an acute angle with the buckler, and in adult specimens are arranged in five
longitudinal rows between the muscular bands. They are more numeroiis at the
anterior extremity of the Synapta, and comparatively deficient at the small bulg-
ing portion. There appears to be a thin epidermis over both anchors and plates
A^ery commonly, and these appendages are produced in layers as in any other

epidermis, the outer layers wearing away and new ones taking their places;

occasionally miniatm-e and imperfect anchors are to be found -with incipient

plates only.

   The author proposed for this animal the name of Synapta GalUennii vel Sarniensis,
and concluded his paper by expressing his ack-nowledgments to both M. J. P.
GaUienne and to Professor Wa-viIIc Thompson for the kind assistance which they
had rendered him in his investigations.

On the Medusoid of a Tubularian Zoophyte, and its Return to'a fixed Cotxdition
     after the Liberation of the Ova. By the Eev. Thomas Hincks, B.A.

The author recorded in this paper observations which he had made on the repro-

ductive zooid of the Podocon/ne carnea, Sars. Specimens which he had kept for

some time exhibited the following changes. After a while the umbrella was thrown

back and turned inside out, occupying the position which it does permanently in the

free gonozooids of some of the Laomedece. It then collapsed and shriveUed up,

the remains of it hanging at the base of the peduncle, and the tentacles streaming-
out behind. The gonozooids (the so-called Medusse) had retui'ned to the polypite

condition. In this state they lived healthily for a time, the lobed mouth being tre-
quently moved about, as if in search of food. The ovaries were laden with eggs.
Similar observations had been made byDujardia and Peach, and by the author, in

the case of Coryne eximia. The changes subsequently «"itnessed had not been re-
corded hitherto. The peduncle became inactive, and, with the remains of the um-
brella, sloughed off, the ova probably being liberated at the same time. The ten-

tacles were then left, with their bulbous bases. The latter coalesced, forming a

hemispherical, orange-colom'ed mass supporting the arms, and around this mass an

ectodermal covering was developed. In this condition they continued for a while,

the tentacles being freely moved about. At length some of them became attached

nmby the base, and a thin  of transparent matter formed round the edge of the disk.

The tentacles withered away, and hi one or two cases an ascending shoot sprouted

from the centre of the orange mass.  Observations  were  not  carried  further                          but,
                                                                                                     ;

to all appearance, a polypite was in course of development.

SenutrJcs on Stilifer, a Genus of quasi-Parasitic Molhislt:s,wit7i particulars of

       the European Species, S. Tui'toni. By J. G^vrN Jeffreys, F.R.S.

   This paper was iUusti-ated by a diagi-am, representing a pair of Stilifers (male
and female) crawling among the spines of an -Ee/iJ/ww J);'o6ac/ii'e/«is, with magnified
drawings of the animal and its embryo. They had been carefidly examined alive,
and under favourable circumstances. S. Turtoni is exceedingly prolific. The whole
of its body is finely and closely ciliated, and the foot and mantle are constructed
so as to prevent the animal or its delicate shell being injured by the spines of the
sea-egg. The Stilifer was observed to feed not on the membrane or any other part
of the Echinoderm to which it attached itself, but apparently on its secretions,
having thus the scavenger habit of a dimg-beetle. It therefore could not be reck-
oned a true parasite. The history of the genus and a synopsis of all the known
species were given, as well as a detailed account of the animal of S, Turtoni.

An Account of the Successfid Accomplishment of the Plan to transport Sahnon-
                          Ova to Australia. By T. Johnson.

   The preparations for the fourth attempt to transport from this country the ova
of the salmon were completed in January of the present year (1864). The plan
adopted upon this occasion diifered in detail from those of the previous expeditions,
being chiefly confined to depositing the ova amongst ice. Upwards of 103,000 ova,
obtained from fish taken out of English and Scotch rivers, were placed in small deal
boxes on beds of moss, and deposited in layers amongst the ice in the ice-house which
was built on board the ship ' Norfolk.' The expedition left this coimtry on the
21st of January, 1864, ani-sing out at Melbourne on the 16th of April. Several of
the boxes were opened, and the ova appeared in most cases in an excellent condi-
tion. The ova in the boxes near the bottom of the ice-house were not so healthy.
By the 20th of April the whole of the boxes, excepting those detained at Melbourne,
were safely deposited in the breeding-boxes on the River Plenty, Tasmania. The
analysis of the boxes showed that, out of 103,000 ova sent out, some 31,000 only

were deposited. On the 4th of May the fish began hatching out : and by the Oth

of June the whole, together with the few trout-ova, had thi-own aside the shell
and were dissporting in their native element. The total number of fish up to the
latest advices was nimibered at between 3000 and 4000. Several reasons have
been given as the causes of the great loss of ova, as also the probable results of the

                     On the Genus Pteraspis. Bi/ E. R. Lankestee.

   The author of this paper first reviewed the labours of previous writers on the
subject, remarking that little had been done of a very definite natm-e with regard

to the systematic arrangement or description of the species. He then minutely

characterized the various species of the genus, two of which, the Pteraspis Crouchii

and the P. Si/mondsi, were previously undescribed. He proposed also to divide the

genus Pteraspis, as it present exists, into three sub-genera, based upon the more or

less complex constitution of the cephalic buckler^ thus :

   The views advanced in this paper were based upon a very considerable amount
of evidence, in the form of specimens and drawings, some from the author's own
cabinet, some transferred to him by Professor Huxley. The discovery of the

scales of Pteraspis by the author, previously announced at the Geological Society,
was alluded to, and the geological range and palteontological relations of the genus

considered.

      On the Turdus torquatus as observed in Devonshire. By Dr. Scott.

   The Turdus torquatus pays an annual "visit to Devonshire, but it confines itself to
the tors and rocky valleys of Dartmoor. It lays four or five eggs, resembling those
of the Turdus merida, save that they are a little lighter in colour, and a little more
elongated in form. Its flight is darting and irregular, and, when on the wing, it

utters a chattering note of alarm ; but it has no prolonged song, like the sylvan

thrushes generally. It feeds chiefly on the Vaccinium Myrtillus ; but when these

are scarce it is seen feeding on the berries to be found in the hedgerows adjacent to
the moor. Its habits more nearly resemble those of the Petrocincla than those of

the true thrushes, and in Devon it is known by the name of the Rock-Ouzel. It

arrives in the end of April, breeds in June and July, and leaves in the beginning of

October.

On the Significance of the Septa and Siphuncles of Cephalopod Shells.

                         By Haert Seelet, F.G.S.

" As the chambers are always empty, the animal must have moved foi-ward,

Whyleaving a vacant space behind; so the question to be solved is.                                did the

creatiure always make the septa shut off" spaces which progressively enlarged ? In

certain gasteropod shells there is something analogous. Tlie genera Murex, Triton,

Manella, for instance, after making their shells uniformly for a third or half of a

whorl, then begin thickening the lip into a varix. In other genera, as BuUmits,
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                 101

  Comis, Ttirritella, species or specimens are found with the earlier part of the spire

 partitioned off. The same phenomena of varices is seen in many bivalves ; and a

 process of shutting off cells in the lower valve is characteristic of several oysters."

 These structures were then shown to result from the periodic enlargement of the

 generative organs. " On examining a Nautilus-sh.e\\, two large muscles are seen

 to have been placed in the lower part of the body-chamber, and connected round

--the involute spire by a narrower muscle an arrangement to which the shell may

 owe its involute form. Beneath the muscles are the liver, which overlaps the
 spire, the ovaries, which abut on a large part of the septum, and certain digestive
 organs above these. Before any new chamber can be made, the shell-muscles
 must have moved forward ; and before any increase in the ovaries can take place,
a space must be formed behind. As the animal steadily grows, all its organs
woidd enlarge; and, with each successive brood, the distended ovaries would
 require more space. There is a similar gradual increase in the size of the air-
chambers. And, since the development of ova woidd necessitate a forward-growth
of the mollusk, the discharge of the ovaries would leave an empty space behind,
into which the creatm-e coidd not retire, which would then be shut off" by a
septum moidded on the animal's body. The Argonaut similarly accumtdates its

eggs in the involute part of the shell, but, not being attached to it, does not form
septa. In the male Nautilus the testes are placed in exactly the same position as

the ovaries of the female, and, excepting the liver, form the largest organ in the

body. It may therefore be concluded that the development of the male org^ans

would produce results similar to those in the other sex, and likewise end in the
formation of chambers. There are no other organs of the body which are liable to
periodic changes in size ; and therefore, as the position and progressive enlarge-
ment with age of the generative apparatus necessitate results like those seen in
the chambei's and septa, I regard one as the catise of the other." The author then

applied his theory to the Dibranchiata. Connecting the chambers is the tube

known as the siphimcle, ninning through every septum to the first, but not
through the nidimental capsule. Seeing the extreme elasticity of many mem-

-- --branes of invertebrata as, for instance, the oral membrane of a starfish the

author pointed out that, when ova were discharged by the Nautilus, there must
remain the empty membrane, which, being attached to the base, could not but

contract into a tube, smaller or larger, according to its tenuity or vascularity.

The fine siphuncle of the Nautilus would indicate a single highly contractile

membrane ; the large siphuncle of Actinoceras may indicate two or three mem-

branes contracting difl'erently.

Address hy Dr. Edwaed Smith, LL.B., F.B.S., President of the Suhsecfion.

It has been customary for the President of this Subsection, on taking the chair,
to deliver an address, less pretentious and of a less general nature, perhaps, than
he wovdd have considered it his duty to prepare for the General Section, but always

offering observations on the progress of the science, whether in its entire aspect, or

in some points of view which woidd  be the most  interesting  to  his  audience                               and
                                                                                                           ;

a custom so valuable and time-honoured must not, even in less able hands, be per-

mitted to lapse. I purpose, therefore, to open the Meetings of this Department with

some introductory observations ; and taking the special rather than the general plan

myof procedm'e, I shall confine  observations to a question limited in its range of
--knowledge, but scarcely limited in its importance and imiversal interest to a

statement of the present condition of the dietary question, considered, first, in its
--103 REPORT 18G4.

practical aspect in public and private dietaries, and, second, in its scientific aspect.
Dietary, regarded in its scientific aspect, is both advanced and retarded by the popular
knowledge which exists respecting it. The universal necessity for food gives in-
terest and importance to the subject, and thus, attracting the attention of inquirers,
advances the science ; but the personal experience of individuals Imiits progress
by leading to the belief that each one knows what is practically valuable for him-
self, and thence what is likely to be proper for others. Hence the scientific aspect
of the question has not the interest to the public which the practical application

of it aflbrds ; and practical knowledge is possessed (so it is said) as much by an
obser^·iug non-scientific as by a scientific man. Each person so far regards himself
as his own authority ; and in reference to the dietaries of those who are not fed from
their own resources, it may be stated that they are almost imiversally framed by

those to whose charge these dependent persons are confided.

  We have a vast mass of paupers in this country, partially fed at home, or entirely

fed in -workhouses at the public expense. With whom do the dietaries of the

latter class originate? From some responsible and well-instructed public officer
who has gained high repute in this branch of knowledge ? No, but with the guar-

dians of the poor ; the gi-eater portion of whom are shrewd and intelhgent men,
who with the aid of theii- medical officer, anive at a decision as to an amount of

food which shall not be in excess of the requirements of the paupers. Hence it is
that there are in England and Wales 700 poor-law dietaries, and not two of them
are alDce. Can it be safely assvuned that with this diversity aU are sufficient to
sustain health and strength ? and derived from such authorities, could we fairly
infer that any are exactly adapted to the wants of both sexes and of all ages ?

   The condition of the dietary of the Army and Navy was, until recent years, de-
plorable. At the latter end of the last and tlie early pai-t of this centiu-y, scurvy,
due to iU-selected food, was rife even in our National Navy ; and inquiries made by
Dr. Budd some twenty years ago, and by Dr. Barnes this year, have showTi that this
disease is still not unfre'quent in the fore cabins of om- Merchant ISavj. No fact is

better established than this, that both sea scurvy and land sciu-vy are due to defi-
cient and ill-selected food ; and striking evidence is afforded by the fact that in om-

--merchant ships it is not found in the master's cabin, whilst it may be rife in the

forecastle not among the well-fed officers, but amongst the ill-fed seamen. Is
there no one set apart by the riovemment to advise upon so important and yet so
simple a question ? No. In former years the dietary of the 'Nnxj was varied at
the instigation of the principal medical officer, and modified by those having the
command of the Fleet in active service ; and whilst it was varied towards improve-
ment, the changes were often most incongi-uous and unscientific. The Grovernment
has no direct control over the dietaiy of seamen in the merchant service, but each
master and ship-owner does that which he thinks proper; and whilst in emigrant

ships a stipidated quantity of food must be provided for each passenger, the defec-

tive aiTangements in respect of cooking greatly lessen the value of this precaution.

   The state of the dietary of om- soldiers has attracted deep attention since the
disclosm-es of the Crimean campaigTi, and by the aid of scientific men improve-

ments of the most valuable kind have been introduced, both in reference to the
variety of food supplied and the mode of cooking it. The time will probably never

ai-rive when the dietaries of our aimy and navy shall be models for the general
commimity, since in time of active service the kind of food must be varied with

the abimdance or deficiency of certain foods, and the cooldng be interfered with
by other duties ; and in times of peace the arrangements can never be so varied and

economical as may be found in a private familj' ; and hence limitation in variety

and excess in quantity (seeing that the fidl economical value of a given food
cannot be obtained) must, and perhaps should, prevail. The supply of meat is

much larger than is foimd in the homes of the working classes, and more than the
working classes require (although they may perform much more labom- than falls

 to the lot of a soldier in rime of peace) ; but it is a compendious food, and one

which may be cooked in different ways- and for separate puiposes, or for combined

 masses with ease and with few utensils, and hence a large quantity of it should be

 allowed.

    The state of the dietary of our prison populations is not only less satisfactoiy
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  103

than that of the army and nary, but is very unsatisfactory. The aim in the feed-
ing of this class is to maintaui health and strength on the least quantity of food,
 and on the food the least palatable ; and some would even risk the health and
 strength for a certain limited time in order to add more effectually to the punish-
ment of the prisoner. At the same time the conditions amder which the prisoners
 are found are most various, both as regards the personal ones of age, sex, health,

 state of constitution, sensibility, and previous habits, and the peiial ones of diu-a-
tion of imprisonment, closeness of confinement, eniplojouent, and labour. Here

then we have a combination of circumstances demaudiug all the Iniowledge which

both science and practice can afford for their proper combination, estimation, and

application to dietary purposes, many (perhaps all) of which may be so estimated
and combined that several well-defined classes may be arranged, and food provided

which shall be so adapted to each, tliat prisoners, however variously employed,

may be fed with equal sufficiency. Can we conceive a case in which the value of

a public officer, thoroughly acquainted "wdth the subject, would be so great as this,
or one in which the conditions under which exact knowledge can be gained would
be so perfect? But uo such officer exists in connexion with, this or any other

department of the Government, and there is no official person to whom the Govern-
ment may tm-n for advice, except the medical officers of each separate prison, or an
inspector of prisons, who may or may not be a medical man, and who, as a medical

man, may or may not be an authority on this question among his medical and

scientific compeers. It seems almost past belief that in so great a country, with

so enlightened a state of public opiniou, and with so gi-eat a mass of persons who

are fed under the direct or indirect supervision of the Government, there should
not be a place for an officer possessed of this special and abstruse Icnowledge.

    Convict prisons are so far distinct from comity prisons that they are under the
direct control of the Government, and for every detail in their management the
Government is responsible. Yet even here, with all the advantages of a central

and common authority, the state of the dietary question is very unsatisfactory.
The time has gone by when death, or even extensive and important disease, can
occm* as the result of the want of food but one need not to have far advanced in

                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

life to be able to remember the prevalence of scurvy in convict establishments,
and the great defect of sanitary rules. Since that period attempts of a convulsive
nature have been made to more exactly fit the dietary to the requirements of the
convicts, so that, on the discovery of evils from delfect of food, a large increase in
the dietary was made, and, this having attracted attention, in a similar convidsive

manner a gi-eat diminution of food was ordered. Gn the opening of the Portland
prison in November 1848, a diet was ordered- which was in excess of that of fi'ee
working men ; but in a few months aftei-wards, on the complaint of some of the

prisoners that they were insufficiently fed,;a considerable increase in the quantity of
meat was made, and in the year following the dietary was again further increased.
There have been of late almost incessant complaints on the part of the public
that the dietary in use in this aud other convict jails was excessive, because it
was better than the diet of free working men, and particularly that so large a
quantity as 36 to 40 ozs. of cooked meat (equal to 48 or 54 ozs. of imcooked meat)
was supplied weekly ; and although prison officials, for the most part, have been
of opinion that the dietaiy was not in excess, another chauge has just been made,
by which no less than about one day's food in seven has been withdrawn from the

convicts employed on public works. Consider for a moment the vast importance
of the question which is thus made to oscillate from one extreme to the other.

If the convicts are too well fed, the evil of waste of food is caused, with its conse-
quent burden to the hard-working and honest community, in addition to its evil
influence upon the mind of the convict in preventing the due appreciation of his
punishment and the recurrence of crime, and the origin of reasonable complaints
on the paii; of honest and hard-working men, and the temptation to the imstable to

fall into crime. On the other hand, if the quantity of food allowed be not excessive,
how great the responsibility of those who lessen it, and how great the crime even
of those who, by thiis lessening it, offer something like a reasonable groimd for

mutinous conduct on the part of the sufferers ! AVhat can afford gi-eater grounds

for the request, on the part of the public, that the highest scientific knowledge
--104 REPORT 1864.

 shall be applied, in order to determine tlie grounds on whicli a fitting dietary shall
 be based in the several conditions of laboui' and confinement in which it shall be
 used, and that no change shall be made tending to lower a dietaiy until by the
 same method it has been proved that the proposed dietary would be sufiicient.
 This is not, however, the method adopted ; but dietaries were framed, as they have
 been recently altered, upon the intimations of non-scientific men, upon the guesses
 of medical men, or upon a general and inexact appreciation of the results of those
 which preceded them. In no instance has such a proof been souglit for as would

 satisfy the requirements of exact research.

   Thus in the most recent change, viz. that effected during the present year, we find
the grounds most imsatisfactory. The Committee appointed to investigate the

subject having ascertained that a certain scheme which had been provided for
county jails in 1843 is still in use in forty to fifty county jails (that is to say in
only one-third of the county jails), they infer, in their own words, "that in these
instances the diet was believed to be sufficient for the maintenance of the health of
the prisoners, and for their support imder the labour to which they were subjected ,·"
and having found, as they say, that these inferences were confirmed in the instance
of some large prison (Wandsworth) open to the inspection of the Committee, there
were reasonable gi-ounds for attempting a reduction of the ordinary dietary in the

Convict Prison. You will observe that the conditions which they inquire into are
not those in which the dietaiy to be recommended by them is to be used ; and even

those conditions are not to be subjected to a rigid scientific examination, but the

Committee, in their own words, simply "inspected several of these prisoners, both
male and female, and found them in a fair state of health considering the length of
their imprisonment;" and from these two facts alone, viz. the continued use of this
echeme in a minority of county and borough jails, and their inspection of a few

prisoners in one county jail, they proceeded to vary the dietary in convict prisons,
and to reduce the cooked meat by 16 ozs. per week.

   The point to which I wish to draw your attention is not whether the dietary
formerly or now in use is or is not exactly adapted to the wants of ihe convicts,
for upon that important point there is no sufficient information, but that changes
are made imder the pressure of mere public opinion, by medical gentlemen, on
gTounds which are not logical, and without making use of the only plan by wliich

--the fitness could be proved that of scientific inquiry into the conditions in which

the dietary is to be used. It could not excite surprise that with such a basis on
which to ground changes in dietary there should appear, even to non-medical
men, sufficient reason to distrust the results. The lioard of Directors of Convict
Prisons accordingly append a letter, in which they state, 1st, that " experience can

only decide whether the dietary is sufficient to keep able-bodied men in good health
during a confinement of many years in prison ;" 2nd, that they reserve to themselves

the definition of light and hard labour; 3rd, that tliey reject the proposition that boj-s

imder set. eighteen, and men above vet. sixty-five years should be placed upon

light-labour die.t ; and 4th, that they modify the fomiula for thickening the soup.
   In the absence of the necessary proofs on wliich to exactly adjust the dietary to

the wants of the convicts, the only safe plan is to allow an amount of food greater
than that which falls to the share of equally hard-working and more honest

labourers.

   Our county and borough prisons offer far greater diversity of dietary than is
found in convict prisons ; for the dietary of each jail is arranged by the magis-
trates, and the Government, wliose assent must be obtained, has no standard
dietary which it can enforce, and no dietary which has been proved on scientific
groimds to be adapted to the different states of prison discipline, and no officer who,
Being specially acquainted with the subject, has been appointed to advise either the
Government or the magistrates in their searcli after truth. Hence, whilst from
one-third to one-half of the jails have adopted a scheme of dietaiy which the
Government has recommended since 1843, but which the late Conmiittee of the
House of Lords, with Lord Camai-von as Chairman, have affirmed to be eminently
imscientific and unsatisfactory, the other half have dietaries which differ each from

the other in almost every particular.

   In none, whether the Government scheme or others, has there been a scientific

 attempt to apportion tlie dietaiy to the different conditions of separate confinement
 in cells, of activity, and of forced laboiu- of most vaiying degTee ; but schemes have
 been in use, some of which are very far below the food obtained by the worst-fed

 men in freedom, and others quite equal to that of the labouring- middle class in this
 country. One having- conmiitted a small offence against the law will be fed upon

 a dietaiy of bread and water or bread and gruel, and be compelled to carry on the
 hardest labom- known; whilst another, and perhaps an old offender, having

 conunitted a serious breach of the laws, will be fed upon food much better than he

 ordinarily obtained in freedom, and be kept in inactivity, or engaged in light handi-

 craft or in occupations which are not laborious.
    The Earl of Carnarvon's Committee, fidly impressed with these defects and

 anomalies, recommended that a Commission should be issued with power to deter-

--mine various questions of dietary by exact research a Commission which, from the

 difficultv of the iuquirj^, must have comprehended some of the best men of the day ;

 but instead of this a Committee of medical officers of convict prisons was appointed,
 who, without experiments of any kind, omitting the chief subjects of inquiiy, and
avowedly discarding scientific Imowledge, have recommended a new scheme, which

--in its nutriment leaves the dietary much as it foi.md it lowering, however, the low,

 and raising the high dietaries, whilst they believed that they had effected the con-

--verse but which throws upon the medical officers of the prisons the most serious

responsibility of deciding whether a given prisoner shall be submitted to the " pro-

gressive dietaries " which they have ordered, and of bring-ing down the labour to
the dietary if, after trial, the dietary which they have ordered with labour should

be foimd insufficient to maintain health and strength.
    In this, as in other changes, the order of things has been inverted, and instead of

proof being first obtained as to the fitness of a dietary, the chaijge is made and the

proof of its fitness sought afterwards. Hence the whole procedure has increased
the anomaly ;-for the magistrates have now before them the old government scheme
which has been decisivelj'^ condemned by the Committee of the House of Lords, and a
new government scheme, confessedly uot buUt upon exact scientific research, fenced
about by several restrictions, left to the discretion and responsibility of the surgeons
of jails, submitted for a trial of nine months' duration, and to be judged of by gentle-
men who do not claim au}' special knowledge on the subject.

   Did I say too much wheu I affirmed that the state of the dietary in prisons is
very imsatisfactory ? The subject of dietary in hospitals involves too many purely
medical details to justify me in discussing it here ; but I may remark that, although
each case of disease must be considered on its own grounds only, it has been found

possible to aiTange several classes of diets in all hospitals under some such heads as

low, middle, and high diets, and consequently there can be no reason why each one

should not be arranged according to the nutriment required imder the conditions in
which they are severally used ; and it is clear that an approach to uniformity is

possible in all our English hospitals. At present the amount of nutriment in each
diet is onh' inferred in a general way ; and if there should be found two hospitals
having the same dietary tables, it is fi-om the accident that one has been copied from
the other. I will also add that the amoimt of nutriment contained in many low

diets (often called tea diets) is so low as to bear no proportion whatever to the

daily requirements of a man, and would justify any medical man in calcxdating the
amount and calling the attention of his professional brethren to the residt.

   As each hospital has and recognizes its own medical authorities in the fonnation
of such tables, and as each medical man must be allowed to exercise his own dis-
cretion in the ti-eatment of disease, I doubt if the uniformity which seems to me
to be so important will ever be attained except after full inquiry made by some
central authority which has power to remimerate those who would imdertake so
large an amount of labour; and hence the public and the profession are justified in

looking to the Medical Department of the Privy Council for the performance of

this service.

   There is, I think, the best reason to believe that the dietary of our private schools

and colleges, and of our charitable institutions for the maintenance and education

of the young, has greatly improved in our day; but it is a subject which stUl

demands public attention. There are multitudes of cheap schools throughout the
                                                                   --

country in which the sum paid with the pupils is manifestly inadequate to remu-

nerate the proprietors of the schools. Avery striking illustration of this occurred a

few months ago, where two ladies with their mother received childreu for board and

education at a sum which jdelded only about 4Jd. per day per head in the family

for all the expenses of rent, taxes, clothing, service, and food required by the

Afamily.     public investigation of this case was made, and the following was

given in evidence on the dietaiy in the school in question :--

" For breakfa-st milk thickened with flour and water, and a round of bread ; and

when they had not this, there was nettle- or onion-broth made -with oatmeal and

water. For dinner on Sunday there was meat and plenty of regetables and

pudding: on Monday pudding alone; on Tuesday cold meat and vegetables; on

Wednesday boiled rice and treacle, or treacle-pudding ; on Thursday meat ; on

Friday rice-pudding ; and on Satiu-day perhaps boiled bacon, or pig"s face with boiled
peas. There was also broth made fi-om sheep's pluck. For tea, a cup of tea and a

round of bread and lard, or more if they wanted it."

   This may perhaps be regarded as an extreme case ; and whilst not insisting too
much upon it, we may fear lest it should represent more or less con-ectly the state

of all the cheap schools throughout the coimtry.

   But to take a higher class of scholastic institution. I know an institution

receiving perhaps loO boys, of ages varying from teu to sixteen, and having all the

staif of a college, in which the following is the daily outline :

   They rise at 6 a.m., and engage in studies until 8 a.m. without receiving any food.

At breakfast they have a mug of cold milk and half a roimd of bread placed before

them, and, after a time, the bread-basket, containing quarters of slices, is passed

round, from which tlie pupils may take a piece. After the morning's studies, the
dinner consists of ny:>at, of wliich a quantity is given which the boys whom I know

state is much less than they receive when at home, and to which none is usually

added. The quantity of potato is very small gener.ally, and bread is not given.

Pudding is sometimes adaed, and sometimes bread and cheese supplies its place.

Only one other meal is allowed in the day, and that is similar to the breakfast.

Thus there are only three meals a day allowed, two of which are cold; and the meat

is practically much limited in quantity. There are moreover more than two hours in

the morning during which no food is supplied, and during part of which the brain

must be at work : and there are fourteen hours between the meagre supper and the

following breakfast. Such a dietaiy must be an insufficient one in the total quan-

tity of nutriment, and particularly in the fat which is supplied ; and it cannot be a
matter of surprise that the boys which I saw were very spare, and ver^' tame and

quiet, both in body and mind.

There is one source of importance which in this matter is common to all these

institutions and to workhouses, viz. that they have charge of children and youths

--during the period of growth a period which once passed over never recurs, and

each year of which has its own special duties, of which, if any remain imperformed

in one year, most rarely can the defect be compensated for in the following years.

Hence, if there be deficient food at this period, the body either falls rapidly into

disease, which terminates fatally before an adult age is attained, or both body and

mind gTOw up -w-ithout that force and ^agour which is characteristic of health,

Anand in which the futiu-e man is less fitted than otliers for the duties of life.

emaciated fiame will probably be associated with a feeble and didl mind, and the

sufterer will rarely attain a position among others in life beyond that of low

mediocrity.

At the period in question, whether we regard the boy physically or mentally, it

is of highest consequence that he be supplied with an abtmdant and well-arranged

dietary, and in nearly all cases the prime elements of diet should be given without

stint. The appetite is not, however, always a sufficient guide : for a boy having been

accustomed to take only a small quantity of food, the desire for a larger quantity is

either lost or was never obtained, and in such cases with plenty within his reach he

will remain underfed. Encouragement to eat is as important in many boys at

school as encoiu'agement to study.

   I am convinced that even yet the fuU importance of dietary during the period of

growth is most imperfectly tmderstood, and hence I have thought it right to bring

it distinctly betore the attention of this Section, and shall be glad if it should

attract the attention of the press, and of gentlemen engaged in the duty of training

the young.

I would also add a word in reference to the monitors and others found in normal

training schools and national schools. The duties which devolve upon the master

or mistress of a national school in giving extra and special instruction to the monitors,

apart from the ordinary duties of the school, excite a most prejudicial eitect upon

the appetite for and digestion of food, by limiting too much the period allowed for

exercise, and extending too fai- the time devoted to brain-work and the period

of I'espiring warm and foul air. The monitors themselves are, lioweA'er, the greater

sufferers, for they are younger, and are still at a period of life when the evils just

refen'ed to exert a tenfold influence. Moreover they are always the children of

the poor, and were iU-fed in earlier years, and upon this basis have undertaken a

new set of duties, which withdraw them from the fresh air, and supplant musciUar

exertion by mental strain                                                                                                                     and,  at  the  same  time, they have  an  income so small,
                                                                                                                                           ;

that it does not suihce for them to obtain nourishment at all adequate to the re-

quirements of mental labom' and of bodily growth. I have had my attention drawn to

this class of persons in a painfid way in connexion with the occurrence of consump-

tion, and I should be glad if public attention could be drawn to their condition.

  A consideration of the dietary of the general community must have regard to

two classes at least, viz. the well-fed middle and higher classes, and the moderately

fed or ill-fed labouring classes ; but time wnll not allow me to refer to the former

further than to otter a few observations on "Bantiugism," whilst I shall describe

the latter in some detail.

   The attention which has recently been called to Bantingism has, I think, been

advantageous to the commimity, by showing the effects which flow from a regida-

tion of dietary, and by gaining the confidence of the public in the science of the

question. The names of the components of food are now far more widely known
tlian before, and we may almost assume that all persons know the difference between

carbon and nitrogen in their vdtimate use in the animal sj'stem. I am not here

concerned with the medical question, as to whether it is desirable to reduce the
bulk of a given individual^a circunistance which must always be left to the judg-

ment of the medical man in charge of the case ; but I feel compelled to state, that

it would be an evil to this nation, both physically and mentally, if the system of
reduction were to become at all general ; and that, on the contrary, regarding the

whole popidation, we need to add to, rather than take from, the' weight of the

body. I would also add my experience as a physician, that even in the well-fed

classes I have seen very serious diminution of both bodily and mental vigour follow
the working out of the plan.

    Omitting, therefore, any reference to the question of health, and considering the

subject scientifically, we must admit that in a fidl-fed and fat man the fat and
fluids of the body may be lessened, and the whole bulk and weight proportionally

reduced by this system, and that upon principles which have long been well esta-
blished. The whole plan is to reduce the carbon or fat- forming elements in the
food to a point much below the daily wants of the system, so that a portion of the

fat ah-eady in the body may be consumed daily, whilst at the same time the nitro-

genoiis elements are supplied with at least their usual abundance. This is effected
by vdthholding separated fats, as butter and the fat of meat, and by very gi-eatly

restricting the analogous food, starch, which enters largely into the composition of
flom- and all gi-ains. The supposed necessity for giving a very large supply of meat
is based upon incorrect reasoning, aud in reality is owing to the fact" that the
carbon which is foimd associated with the nitrogen in lean flesh is required from
the too great reduction which has been made in the sugar, fat, and starch in other
food. For the purpose in hand it is more consistent with sense and science to
allow the usual variety of food, but to limit the total daily amount of it, so that
the quantity of carbon shall be in defect of the daily wants, and the quantity of
nitrogen remain as before. There is no necessity for the absolute excision of fat
and sugar, and the extreme reduction in the quantity of bread, any more than for

the great increase in the quantity of meat. The bulk of the body may be reduced.
108 REPORT--1864.

simply by lessening- the amount of the kinds of food usually taken ; and as the re-
duction is more slowly effected, it is a process attended by less danger to the

health.

   It may not be doubted that in proportion as the system is extensively adopted,

and, in a given case, is worked out rapidly, so will be the prevalence of heart-

diseases, derangement of digestion, and gout. Seeds are now sown which will

yield a plentiful harvest to medical men.

   To turn now to the dietary of om* labouring population. An inquiry of a
character unique, at least in extent, has just been completed by me for the

Government, which will afford a clearer insight than has hitherto been obtained
into the dietary of our labouring populations, and will enable us to appreciate
both its merits and defects. It has been made at the homes of the agricultural
labourers in every county in England, in Wales, in the west and north of Ireland,
and in the west and south of Scotland ; at the homes of certain town populations,
as silk- and cotton-weavers, seamstresses, kid-glovers, shoemakers, and stocking-
weavers, with all the care and minuteness which science could suggest ; and with-

out burdening this address with the details, which may be found in the Sixth
Report of the Medical Officer of the Privy Council, I may describe the results

imder the two general heads of the quantity of food and nutriment, and the nature

of each class of food.

   In doing this I must beg of you to bear with quotations of figures to an extent

greater, perhaps, than I shoidd think appropriate to an address of this nature.

   I will now ofier some observations upon the separate classes of foods akeady re-

--ferred to.
   1st, Brcaclstvffs. The coarse kinds of bread which were in ordinary use by our
forefathers, even to the early part of the present century, are now very rarely eaten.
Barley bread is still used in the houses of labourers in South "N^^ales, and in the
farmhouses of North aud South Wales and Anglesea ; also by the labourers in
Northumberland in the north, and in Cornwall and Devon in the south of England,
and in the southern parts of Scotland ; but, except in certain poor districts in
South Wales, it is not anywhere now used as a principal member of the class of
breadstuffs. In nearly every locality it is now mixed with rye-meal, or with
various proportions of wheaten flour. Rye bread is nowhere eaten alone, but
the meal is mixed with barley meal ; and in the north of England rye is grown with
wheat in the field, or the gi'ains are subsequently mixed together in the proportion
of 1 part of rye and 3 parts of wheat, and Imown as marlin. It is also added in
small proportions to brown wheat meal in London to give a moist condition to the
bread. Oatmeal is used by 20 per cent, of the farm labourers in England ; but only
in Northumberland, Cumberland, and Westmoreland is it eaten as a breadstuff,
and there it is not a principal member of the class. In the west of Scotland it is

--still the principal breadstuff, and in the south it is extensively but not so exclu-

sively eaten ^Ijarley meal and wheaten flour being also used. It is now more
largely eaten in the north and west of Ireland than was formerly the case, being

preferred to Indian corn, aud occupying a middle position between that aud wheaten
flour. Indian corn is eaten exclusively in the south and west of Ireland, where
exceeding poverty is an incubus upon the people, and is eaten alone or with the
addition of oatmeal. Pea meal is never eaten alone as bread, but in the north of

Scotland it is sometimes added to oatmeal for that purpose. WheatenJlovr is now
exclusively used to make bread for all the town popidations, and in nearly every dis-

trict of England for the farm-labouring populations, and, with the exception of the
Western Highlands of Scotland, the south and west of Ireland, and certain portions
of South Wales, is universally the principal breadstuff' obtained by the population.
The abundant supply, the fine quality, and the low price of it of late years have
even induced the poor to discard the tise of the bro-«Ti wheaten meal which was

so commonly eaten when I was a J'outh, and nowhere now is brown or whole-
grained wheaten flom* the ordinary breadstufi" of even single families, much less of

small communities. In all the inquiries throughout England I found but one or

two families who commonly purchased it.
   This is a strildng change" in the habits of the people, and we may well ask -what

is the reason for the exclusion of the low-priced breadstuffs, and the universal use of
                                     TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                           109

an article whicli until recently was only within the reach of the better classes.
The reasons are sound.

   1. The low price of good white flour, and the very small difference between
that and the price of coarser foods ; nay, brown wheat meal is now charged at
as high a price as the white floui-, and oatmeal is everywhere dearer than wheaten

Horn'.

   2. The flavour of the white wheaten flour is more agi-eeable than that of any
other breadstuff; and this is of the highest importance in point of economy, for the

children of the poor will eat dry white bread ; but with brown wheaten or rye or
barley bread they must have treacle or some kind of fat.

   3. Its use may be constant, whilst that of the coarser foods must be intermittent,
both because the latter rather repel the appetite, and because the husk of the brown

flour, ov the barley meal, and often of the oatmeal also purges undidy, and particu-
larly in children and sensitive women.

   4. The income of the labourer has increased of late years, and he is now better

informed and more observant, and has also improved in his tastes and habits.
   In Western Scotland oatmeal has held its place in the belief that it is a

stronger food than wheat meal ; but more probably because wheat does not grow
there general^, and from the fixedness of the national character. In Ireland the
maize is a very modern innovation, but it is the cheapest breadstuff' which can be
supplied, and extreme poverty compels them to take it gladly, whilst at the same
time they detegt it. They cannot afford to purchase wheat flour in the quantity
which their wants demand ; but they long for it, and with improved means will

obtain it.

   In the districts where the coarser grains are still used, the labourers obtain them
as a part of theii- wages, or have some special privilege allowed to them by the
farmer in the purchase of them, and hence the use of them is only in small part

voluntary.

   Bice was used by about 58 per cent, of the population, but never in the place of

bread, or as a principal breadstuff. Its price is high, and it must be cooked, whilst

--good bread is cheap, ready for eating, and universally procurable. Dried peas are

eaten only imder two circumstances when there is broth, and when fresh vege-

tables are scarce or absent, and hence are eaten almost exclusively in the winter.
They do not constitute anywhere an important part of the dietary. It must, how-
ever, be added that in the cotton and silk districts the example which has been

offered to the poor has induced them to eat both rice and peas more abundantly

than heretofore.

Of these various breadstuffs the farm labourers and their families, in the average

of all England, obtain per adult weekly 12^ lbs. of breadstuHs, those of Wales

14 lbs., of Scotland 12f lbs., and of Ireland 20^ lbs. ; so that England and Scot-

land stand at the foot, and Ireland at the head of the list. Of indoor operatives,
silk-weavers obtained 9i lbs., needlewomen 7f lbs., kid-glovers 8f lbs., shoe-

--makers 11^ lbs., and stocking-weavers nearly 12 lbs. quantities below those of
--outdoor labourers, and differing as 9-6 lbs. to 13| lbs.

   D-esh Vegetables. The operatives in towns obtain a somewhat uniform quantity

of fresh vegetables all the year round. Potatoes are there the chief article of this

class                      but when  cabbages  are  cheap  they are  frequently eaten,  and  cauliflower or
                        ;

some other luxury is obtained for the Sunday. Farm labourers almost universally

grow potatoes and other vegetables. As a m\e, they eat potatoes from the early

gathering in June or July until about the following Christmas to March, when their

stock ceases, and a little time elapses before green vegetables are procurable.

When cabbage is plentiful it is eaten in large quantities daily, but when otherwise

its use is restricted to Sunday, and perhaps one or two other days of the week.

Rhubarb, fruits, new peas, onions, &c. are obtained in their season, but to supply

nutriment cabbage and potatoes are alone relied upon. Hence there are three to

six months in the year when a large mass of farm labourers do not obtain potatoes,

and perhaps only one or two months during which they use cabbage very largely.

When fi-esh vegetables are scarce, more breadstuffs are consmned.

In Ireland there are two distinct and alternate dietaries, one with and the other

When·without potatoes.                         potatoes are in use the usual allowance is 3^ lbs. per

head, thrice a day. I found families eating 440 Ihs. per week. Universally it is of

the highest importance that the farm labourer may gi-ow an abundant supply of

potatoes, since it converts his otherwise unprofitable time iuto monej', or saves the

expenditure of money in more costly foods.

 --Stiffars. Cane-sugar or treacle, or both, are almost universally used ; the latter

in the place of fats chiefly, aud the former almost exclusively with tea or coffee.
Treacle, at the high price charged for it in villages, is not regai-ded as a cheap
food, since it sinks into the bread and the chiltben cannot taste it ; and wherever

milk is very abundant, as in Devonshire, the use of sugar is almost restricted to the

baby. It is eaten in Ireland with the maize when made into stirabout, but in
England it is less eaten by the poorer than by the better-paid labourers. Thus,
only 4 oz. per head were eaten in Wilts and Somerset, whilst IGoz.were consumed

in Lancashire. Sugar is everywhere regarded as a luxury.
   Separated sugars were obtained by 98 per cent, of the farm labourera in England,

92 per cent, in Wales, 96 per cent, in Scotland, and 82 per cent, in Ireland ; and

--the quantity per adult weeldy was England 7^ oz., W'ales 7^ oz., Scotland 5^

oz., and L-elaud 4f oz. ; so tliat Wales occupied the head, and Ireland the foot
of till? list, both in frequency and quantity. Of indoor operatives, silk-weavers
obtained 7.V oz., needlewomen 7^ oz., kid-glovers 4J oz., shoemakers 10 oz., and
stocking-weavers 11 oz.; and hence the average was higher than that of outdoor
labom-ers, as 8 oz. to 0-6 oz. The frequency with which they were obtained waa

--the same in both classes on the whole average.
   Fats. These are butter, dripping, lard, and suet. JButter is obtaiued almost

universally, and in the villages is dearer than in towns. In some Welsh farm-
houses it is made from the skimmings of the buttermilk. Dripping can be obtained
only in towns, or by the favour of some wealthy person in the neighboiu-hood; and
hence, although highly prized and by far the most econoiuical fat, its use is very
partial aud uncertain. Lard is the most largely obtained where the farm labom-er
is happy enough to Ivcep and kill a pig ; but such cases are a minority. In South
Wales the labourer reserves it for sal^, or to sharpen his tools, aud considers it too

valuable for liini to eat. When it must be bought, the supply is very intermittent

and small. Sxct is generally bought with the meat, in quantity sufficient for the
Simday's pudding; and where pudding is a daily item of dietary, as in Somerset,

the use of suet may be extended to one or two other days. Its use is very geueral
both in town and country popidations. Fats are regarded as a luxiuw, and cut off
when pressiu-e occurs, but not in quite the same degi-ee as sugar. Hence the least

supply is in the poorest, and the greatest in the better class districts, varjdng in
the different counties from less than .3 oz. to more than 10 oz. per adult weekly.

    Separated fats were eaten less universally and in less quantity than sugars.
Thus, of farm labourers in England 09 per cent., in Wales 92 per cent., in Scotland

--93 per cent., and in Ireland only 42 per cent, obtained separated fats; and the

weekly quantity per adult was England .5^ oz., Wales 5| oz., Scotland 4oz.,
and li-elaud 1 1 oz., sho-s\'ing great disparity in the quantity and frequency between
Ireland aud England ; but placing them in the same order as in that of sugars,
sUk-weavers obtained 4i oz., needlewomen 4|^ oz., kid-glovers 7 oz., shoemakers

--5f oz., and stocking-weavers 3^ oz. quantities much below those of out-door ope-
--ratives in England, but identical on the average of both classes.

    Meat. Speakiug generally, butchers' meat is the kind used in towns, and bacon
in the country; .30 per cent, of the latter never eat butchers' meat, but 99 per

cent, obtain one or the other kind.
    In towns, butchers" jueat can be obtaiued at any moment, in small quantities

and in cheap pieces : but in villages the supply is only weekly, and the price of the

inferior joints is greater than in to-wu. Some buy half an ox-head or a .sheep's
head, weeklv, and make broth and skim ofl' the fat for future use. Bacon may
sometimes be fed by the labourer ; aud when otherwise, it can be bought at any

-- --time often bought at the gi'ocer's shop on credit can be cut into small portions,
--supplying meat to the parents and dripping to the children is fat, and thus sooner
--satisfies is more relishing than butchers' meat, and can be readily fried with cold

potatoes or ^vith cabbage. The American bacon can be bought at half the price of

the English bacon, but the poor prefer the latter.
            TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  Ill

A meat dinner is universally obtained on the Sunday, and in turns is renewed

four to six tinaes a week ; but in the countiy, if the farm labourer be poor, the re-
mainder is reserved for the husband diuiug the week ; and if less poor, and the wife
be a good manager, a morsel is obtained three or foiu- times a week, or even daily.

When the husband cannot return home to dinner, he takes his cold meat or bacon

with him, and a hot supper is provided on his return. The same occm-s when the
wife and other members of the family work in the tield* and cannot return to cook

food. In certain counties, as Somerset, Dorset, Norfolk, Suftblk, Essex, Bucks,

Herts, Himts, Cambridge, and Beds, pork is the sole meat eaten, and is generally fat
and pickled. In .\nglesea the animals are slaughtered in the summer, aud the whole
meat is salted for the winter. In the Highlands of Scotland the shepherds and

--others have only braxy mutton that of lambs and sheep fomid dead. The use of

the meat of calves <S:c' which have died a natural death is not uncommon in South
Wales and in many parts of England. Fish is chiefly eaten on the coast ; but red
herrings are a common food both in town and country, and especially in the winter,
and fresh hen-ings and other iish when very cheap. Herrings packed in barrels

and newlj' salted are a very common food in the Western Highlands of Scotland ; but,

generally speaking, tish is not an important article of food throughout England.

   The husband obtains the lion's share of the meat or bacon, and the wife says

that he wins the bi-ead and needs it.
   Meats were eaten among farm labourers by 99 per cent, in England, 84 per cent,

in Wales, 72 per cent, in Scotland, and 59 per cent, in Ireland, in quantities per
adidt weekly of 10 ozs. in England, 12f ozs. in ^N'ales, lOi ozs. in Scotland, and
only 4^ ozs. in Ireland, yielding a higher return in reference to England than was

expected, aud showing how low Ireland stands both in fi'equency and quantity.

   Of indoor operatives, silk-weavers obtained 7^ ozs., needlewomen 15 ozs., kid-

--glovers 18i ozs., shoemakers 15f ozs., and stocking-weavers llf ozs. quantities

relatively high, but on the average very slightly less than those of outdoor la-

--bourers.
   3Iilk. In a butter coimtrv the only kind of milk attainable is skim milk and

buttermilk, and when the former is cheap, as in Devon (one farthing per pint), the
latter is not eaten by the labourers. Skimmed milk is usually poorer than butter-

milk in fat. In hot weather it is kept so long that it turns on boiling, and cannot

therefore be cooked. Buttermilk is used largely in South Wales and in Ireland,
and in the foimer is often given to those who help to churn ; but, except in those

localities, it is not so highly appreciated as it shoidd be. In a cheese country only

whey can be had, aud the poor rarely regard that as human food. In arable dis-

tricts milk of every kind is exceedingly scarce, so that even the farmer cannot ob-

tain it for himself. lu some pasturage disti-icts the whole land is devoted to feeding

animals, and then no milk can be obtained ; but usually a district of pasturage is

favom'able to the supply of mUk to the labourer. New mUk is always attainable

in towns, but generally almost or quite unattainable in the districts and locsditiea

whence it is sent to towns. It is abundant in the Highlands of Scotland, and a
Scotch pmt, or 3i English pints, is the daily allowance to a labourer. In many

parts of England the farmer feeds his calves and hoimds with it, and denies it to

the laboiu-ers, because it is inconvenient to find some one to measure it out when

asked for. Many gentlemen distribute skimmed milk gratuitously, and others sup-

Aply new milk at a low price.  few labourers keep a cow in the lanes of their dis-

trict, and then have plenty of milk ; but generally speaking, the supply of milk is

quite inadequate to the wants of the country. Some farmers who do not sell

milk, allow their labourers to have a quarter of a pint of cream on Saturday for

one penny.

Of outdoor labourers 72 per cent, obtained milk in England, 100 per cent, in

Wales and Scotland, and 98 per cent, in Ireland ; and whilst the quantity per adult

weekly was only 32 ozs. in England, it was 85 ozs. in Wales, 124| ozs. in Scotland,

--and 135 ozs. in Ii-eland quantities greatly in favour of the Irish and Scotch

peasantry. The quantity obtained by indoor operatives was very small, viz. 22 ozs.
by silk-weavers (including those at Macclesfield), 7 ozs. by needlewomen, 18i ozs.

by kid-glovers, 18 ozs. by shoemakers, and 24f ozs. by stocking-weavers. The
amount wa§ very small in London.
112 REPORT 1864.

  --Cheese. In tlie poorest districts of England and in Soutli Wales cheese is eaten

very largely by the labouring popidatiou^ whilst in the better-paid districts, as
Yorkshire, it is regarded as a luxiu'v, and eaten rarely. In the west of Ireland,
where the people are so poor, they say cheese is too dear for them, and I scarcely
foimd a family which purchased it. The explanation of this anomaly is the price
charged for the kind of cheese in question. In Dorset, Somerset, and Wilts, and in
South Wales, the cheese which is so largely eaten is made from skimmed milk, and
is highly nitrogenous, but it is tough if too new, and hard if more than one ^-ear old.

It is sold retail at 2^d. to Qkd. per lb. I found a man and his wife in Wales who

ate 1 lb. a day each, and lived almost entirely on bread and cheese. In other dis-

tricts this kind of cheese is unknown, and when 8f7. to IQd. per lb. is charged for

it, the poor rightly regard it as wasteful. It should be ^vell understood that the
cheap cheese contains more nitrogen than dearer cheese, but is deiicient in fat

(carbon) and flavour, and when it is in a digestible state, it is three times as cheap
food as the richer kinds. Cheese is eaten generally by indoor operatives living
in countiy districts or country towns. Those living in London eat it less abun-

dantly.

   Among farm labourers 57 per cent, obtained cheese in England, 72 per cent, in

Wales, and 48 per cent, in Scotland, whilst its use was almost unknown in Ireland.
The quantity per adult weekly was b^ ozs. in England, Q^ ozs. in Wales, and
2^ ozs. in Scotland. Of indoor operatives, shoemakers ate about 3| ozs. per adult
weekly, stocking-weavers 2i ozs., and kid-glovers in Somerset 10 ozs., whilst
silli-weavers and needlewomen scarcely ever pm-chased it. Its extensive use
was restricted to South Wales, Dorset, and Somerset, but it was generally eaten

--in Gloucester, Durham, Sussex, Sm'rey, Hants, and Rutland.
    Tea. Tea is used almost universally both by indoor and outdoor operatives,
except in the very poor districts of South Wales and the west of Ireland. It is
drunk very weak, and the infusion is little more than hot water flavoured. In

many districts it is drunk with sugar, as in Devon, in others without milk, and the

-- --very poor cutting off milk and sugar rather than tea drink the infusion alone.

Its use supplies a warm fluid in a palatable form, which is necessary and agree-
able in both hot and cold weather alike, and a meal is made by it for the wife and
children, when bread, with a little treacle or fat, is added. In a very few cases,
the husband takes a cold infusion with him to his work, and one famUy consumed

f lb. of tea per week. It is very desirable in the poorest districts that tea should
not be introduced, since it is a dear food in relation to its cost, and most important

-- --everywhere that it shoidd not supplant milk in the dietary of children. Many

needlewomen the poorest class of operatives take tea thrice a day, and buy i oz.
daily. This is the most ill-fed class, and the one which spends money with the

least economy. When the pressure of want is not so great, it may well be ad-
mitted as a luxmy, and as supplying a warm agreeable fluid with the bread.

--Coffee is used by 44 per cent., whilst tea is drank by 99 per cent.
   Beer and Cider. In the cider districts two to four pints of cider are allowed
daily to each labourer, and in harvest time the quantity is increased to one and even
to two gallons. Half that quantity is allowed to each woman. Beer is not
usually given except during harvest time and on occasions of special labour ; but
whenevereither cider or beer is given its value is estimated and considered as a part
of the wages ; hence it cannot be doubted that, regarded as food, they are dear, and
it woidd be much better to allow their value in money, and leave the labourer to

drink as he pleases. This is indeed done in a very few places. When the wife

does not work in the fields, she most rarely obtains either beer or cider ; for whatever

maj' be the quantity allowed to the husband, it is quite exceptional to find a man
who takes any portion of it home. I have been exceedingly struck with the very

small quantity of beer which is drimk by farm labourers' families. In towns it is
far more general for the operative and his family to obtam beer, and usually it is
drunk at suppertime, and particidarly on Saturday nights and Sunday. In some
country villages I foimd a weak beer which was sold at 2d, per gallon, and which
was the ordinary beverage of the operative.

    Hence, in reference to luxurious foods, as sugar, fats, meats, and tea, England and
Wales stand at the head, whilst in reference to breadstuli's and milk, England is

Aat the foot.   comparison of the diet of iocloor and outdooi' labourers shows that

the former obtain tar less breadstutfs and milk, but both are equal in reference to

luxurious foods, as sugar, meat, fat, and tea. When we regard the returns as a

whole, it will be seen that an outdoor (farm) labourer's family obtains 13| lbs. of
breadstufis, Gi ozs. of sugar, 5 ozs. of fats, 14 ozs. of meats, 52 ozs. of milk, 5 ozs.

of cheese, and ^ oz. of tea per adult weekly ; whilst an indoor operative eats 9^

lbs. of breadstuiis, 8 ozs. of sugars, 5 ozs. of fats, 131 ozs. of meats, 18 ozs. of milk,

and f oz. of tea per adult weekly.

 --The amount of Carhon, ILjdrofjen, and Nitrnyen. The amount of carbon and

nitrogen which is contained in the above dietaries, reckoned per adidt weekly, is as

follows :

    Farm labourers obtained in England 13-2 ozs., in Wales and Anglesea 15-8 ozs.,

in Scotland 16 ozs., and in Ireland, with the maize dietary, 14-1 ozs., yielding an

--average of 14'8 ozs. of carbon. The free hydroo:en, when reclconed as carbon, makes

the following additions : England 0'84 oz., Wales and Anglesea 0-89 oz., Scot-

land 1-09 oz., and Ireland 1-17 oz. Scotland thus stands at the head and England

at the foot ; but a yet higher amoimt is found in the Anglesea dietaries, viz. 19-8

ozs. of carbon. Indoor operatives universally obtained a less amount of carbon

--even the well-fed cotton operatives in times of plenty obtained only 13'4 ozs.

quantity almost identical with that of English farm labourers, but stocking-weavers

had 10-9 ozs., shoemakers 10-3 ozs., needlewomen 9-4 ozs., kid-glovers 9-3 ozs., and,

least of all, silk-weavers 9 ozs. Hence tlae farm labom-er occupies a much hioher

position in his dietary than has heretofore been assinmed, a position also somewhat

higher than the standard quantity which I estimated to be necessary from experi-

ments upon myself and others, viz. 12-5 ozs. of carbon for the hard-working classes.

Whilst the gi-and average in farm labourers was nearly 15 ozs. of carbon, that of

three classes of indoor labom-ers was 9j ozs., and the average of the whole was only

10 ozs. As to nitrogen, the farm labourers in England obtained daily 242 grs.,

in Wales and Anglesea 290 grs., in Scotland 335 grs.. and in Ireland, with the

maize dietary, 347 grs., yielding a grand total of 300 grs. daily. Anglesea, again,

stood the highest of the large divisions of the kingdom, and oiferod 300 grs. daily.

There is a marked contrast between tlieso retm-ns and tliose of the indoor la-

--bourers, if we again except the well-fed cotton operatives, whose dietary furnished

249 grs. daily a quantity almost identical with that of the English labourer ; for

stocking-weavers obtained only 188 gi's., shoemakers 190 grs., kid-glovers 175 gi's.,

silk-weavers 1G4 grs., and needlewomen 135 grs. Hence, whilst the average con-

sumption by farm labom-ers was 300 grs., that by indoor labourers was less than

200 grs., and thus, contrarj' to general belief, the inhabitants of country districts

obtain more food than those of towns.

    Such is the statement of the food obtained by different classes of the community,

some doubtless as a whole, and others in part, containing members which are ill-

fed. It must, however, be added that a subdivision of th^ class of farm labourers,

viz. those living at the farmhouses, obtain far more food than the above quantities

represent, and are doubtless amongst the most fully-fed persons in the kingdom.

The quantity of carbon and nitrogen contained in the food of a labourer in York-

shire was 26^ ozs. and 570 gTS. There were also some labom-ers found who, livino- at

home, ate veiy largely, as in Ireland 35 ozs. of carbon and 645 grs. of nitrogen, in

Scotland 27 ozs. of carbon and 500 grs. of nitrogen, and in England 23 ozs. of car-

bon and 430 grs. of nitrogen per adult daily. On the other hand, some of this class

in England obtained only 6i ozs. of carbon and 125 grs. of nitrogen.

    Extremes yet wider apart are found when both indoor and outdoor labourers

are considered together. Thxis, one needlewoman ate less than 4 ozs. of carbon and

less than 100 grs. of nitrogen, and many of that class obtained less than 5 ozs. of

carbon and 120 grs. of nitrogen daily. So wide apart are these numbers, that the

highest is nine times greater in carbon and twelve times greater in nitrogen than

the least, and yet both alike are the daily food of an adult tiuman being.

   The Lancashire operatives offer, however, the least exceptionable information as
to the diverse quantities of food which the human body can take for lengthened

periods and yet remain in good health under both conditions. Thus, on the average

of  the  whole  inq-1uiries,  they            obtained  13i  ozs.  of  carbon  and  250 grs.  of  nitrogen  daily

in good times, whilst lately the quantities were reduced to Qlozs. and ISogi-s.
Even the same person ate at one time 20 ozs. of carbon and 373 grs. of nitrogen,

and at another 11 ozs. and 188 grs., whilst another person reduced her dietary fi'om

14jOZ9. to &I-OZS. of carbon, and from 233 grs. to lOSgi's. of nitrogen daily.

With such facts as these, how difficult it is to prove what food is really required

Weeven by the classes from which they have been derived!           cannot assume

that 35 OZS. of carbon are necessary for a farm laboxu'er, when others placed in very

similar circumstances obtain only one-fifth of that quantity ; neither are we entitled

to affirm that the least quantity is sufficient, seeing that such small quantities are

but rarely found. The proper quantity lies somewhere between the two, and pos-

sibly where the average is cbawn ; but since men are not fed on the average, but as
individuals, to assume that is to almost assume the whole argument. When dif-

ferent classes of persons are included in the inquiry, we may be prepared from

general knowledge to find some diflerence in their wants ; but can it be assumed

with safety, that because some needlewomen live on 4 ozs. to 5 ozs. of carbon

daily and keep ia moderate health, so small an amount only is necessary ?

The extent of this abstract precludes nij oflering fm-ther observations upon the

dietary of the poor, but I would add in a line that the children and wives are

almost universally ill-fed ; that a large proportion of the infant mortality and of

deaths from consimiption before adult life may be properlj' traced to the tea and

--sop the wretchedly innutritions feeding in very early life ; that the poor of our

mday are in danger of placing mere taste and flavour before nutrition, as the pm--

chase of high-priced bacon, fresh butter, and of high-priced food in general ; and

that it is not at all so thoroughly imderstood as it should be, that a man's first duty

is to provide sufficient nourishment for his family, and, if necessary-, to do this

should limit them to dry bread, or bread and dripping, or to the stirabout and

skimmed milk and the potatoes and buttermilk of the Irish peasantiy. He should
be taught how to place supply of nom-ishment first, and variety of food and pleasure
of the palate second. It is also to be much regretted that so much of his wages

are spent in beer and cider, either volimtarily or involimtarily, and that he has not

universally the opportunity of purchasing cheap milk and of growing an abundant

supply of potatoes.

  I will now indicate in a few words, and therefore very generally, the present state

of the dietary question in a scientific point of view, and in doing so we shall find

--this satisfaction that whUst more remains to be done than has hitherto been

effiicted, much of the knowledge which has been acquired is conclusive in its

nature.

The chemical constitution of foods has been determined in an exact manner and

on a scale of great magnitude both in this countiy and abroad, and although in

calcidating the nutritive elements in foods it is still desirable to quote the authority

on which we rely, this is less owing to errors in the analyses, than to the qualities

of the various samples which are in actual use. Thus the composition of the lean

and fat of meat is well known, as is also the proportion which these bear to each

other in the whole of a well-fed or a moderately-fed animal ; but an approximation

to the truth only can be made when we apply this knowledge to a particular j oint
of meat, or to the various joints which are commonly consumed by the poorer or

the richer sections of the community respectively. So with regard to other foods.

ISIilk varies in the amount of all its constituents according to the particidar cow and

to the food which is supplied to it, so that one cow yields more butter and another

more cheese, whilst the grass of the rich lowlands affiards far richer milk than that

of the hills and moimtaiu-sides. Bacon varies according to its degree of dryness

butter according to the quantity of salt and of water which it contains, and cheese

according to its quantity of fat. Hence, whilst the analyses of foods imder many

conditions have been accurately made, there is and always will be, in the application

of this knowledge to the dietaries of individuals, a certain error ; but it is not to an

amount which in the least mterferes with the truthful application of this knowledge

on the large scale which is needful in a daily or weekly dietary.

There is a suspicion that the analysis of a few foods, as, for example, some

of the very great number of varieties of these, requires correction, and in reference

to the odoiu's of alcohols and of fragrant substances but little advance has been
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  115

made. There seem also to be groimda for the belief that our knowledge of the
active properties of tea and coffee is not yet complete. It is singular that in the
market the only test applied by the merchant is the flayour, which doubtless mainly

depends upon the essential oil of the leaf, whilst in the laboratory the test is the

quantity of theine ; the former, viz. the aroma, varies greatly in the different speci-

mens of tea, whilst the latter (the theine) may be as abundantly found in the low-

priced as in the high-priced teas. There is an agreeable effect produced by tea
which the theine does not account for, and thence it is inferred that there must be

some hidden quality in tea which produces it ; but when we refer to the poor man's
tea, to 2 ozs. of tea per week for a family, used thrice a day, affording not more

than half a teaspoonful of tea for the whole meal of a family, it is difficult to belie^'e

that much more influence is found in the cup than that of a pleasant warm di'ink,

and one the use of which is universal and fashionable.
   The physiology of foods is in a less satisfactory state than that of their chemical

constituents, and as it is a much more recondite question, the latter has perhaps too

exclusively usui-ped its place in detei-miuing the value of foods.

   Thus, the husk of grains, even the inner part which is directly in association with

--the fecula, contains a larger proportion of niti-ogenous matter than is foimd in the

fecula, and thence it has been inferred nay, in spite of every exposure of the fallacy,
it is still maintained by those interested in bread companies, that the meal deiived
from the whole grain is more nutritious than that obtained from the fecula alone.

In periods of famine the bark of trees has been selected for food, because it contains

a certain amoimt of starchy matter, and the wood of plants, when sa^vn into a line
powder, has been mixed with other substances and eaten as food ; but because the
sawdust is rich in nitrogen, as rich as is the husk of seeds, would it not be repug-
nant to common sense to affirm that it is not only a good food, but that wheaten
flom* would be a better food with a portion of sawdust added to it ? Yet such is

precisely the state of the question with regard to the bran or the husk of grain ; it is

indigestible in the human stomach, and when eaten as food, all the indigestible part

remains unused, and in passing through the bowel acts as an irritant and laxative.
Hence the digestibility of various foods is a prime element in the calculation of
the nutritive values of foods. This quality varies somewhat according to the indi-
vidual, so that foods which are useful to one are injurious to another. Moreover,
our knowledge of the degree of digestibility of any food is a matter rather of infer-

ence than of fact ; still, when foods are mixed as in ordinary diet, the amount of

imused matter in the daily supply has been ascertained with an approach to truth,
and suffices for comparison wlien changes of mixed foods are made. The extension
of this knowledge is of the highest importance in physiology, and particularly in

reference to those who are fed at the public expense, and whom it is a public duty

to feed sufficiently at the smallest cost. The problem is one very easy of solution
under proper conditions, and consists simply in determining, under certain typical
conditions, what proportion of a given food leaves the body unused. The method
is accurate, and not difficult of application, and of all conditions in which it could
be used, that of human life is probably the best, since typical men could be selected,
and every other condition, except that imder inquiry and the efiect of season, could

be kept unifonn from day to day. I am very desirous to impress this part of the
subject upon the public mind, for in no other way can the information which is so
essential to the public weal be acquired. Had the recommendation of Lord Car-

narvon's Committee of the House of Lords been adopted by the Government, and
a suitable Commission been issued, the whole question of tbe digestibility of foods
might have been set at rest in the course of two years.

   As to the chemical constitution of foods, there are certain leading facts relating
to this subject which have been under constant inquiry for some years past through-
out Em-ope and America, and much information has been gained. These refer to
the transformations of foods, and to the outlets by which they finally leave the
body. Thus the experiments of the late Dr. Dundas Thompson, Messrs. Lawes

and Gilbert, myself, and others, have, I think, proved that, whilst nitrogenous foods
supply the nitrogenous tissues, and ultimately leave the body chiefly as urea, they
have the fm-ther quality of stimulating aU vital actions, and thereby of increasing
the transformation of other and carbonaceous foods. The transformation of the

                                                                                                          8*
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;:

116 REPORT 1864.

vegetable acids, and of starch and sugar, and tlie deportment of fat whilst in the
body, and its final transformation, seem to be well established ; but it yet remains

to show why so many substances, as fat, starch, and sugar, haying an analogous

composition, should be found so universally in the foods provided for man, and

why he seems to need a portion of each of them. The fact also that certain sub-

stances leave the body without having experienced any change whilst passing
through it, is established, as, for example, odours of almost every kind, and, so far

as our knowledge now extends, we may add alcohol also. I do not say " alcohols,"
since that class embraces many iluids differing much from each other, and all except

alcohol itself containing elements which do undergo the process of ti-ansformation
but I refer only to alcohol, whether taken alone, or with colouring and flavouring
matters in spirits, or with these and certain nutritive substances in all spirits.
There can be no doubt that alcohol, as alcohol, leaves the body by every outlet for

many hours after it has been taken, and for a period of at least thirty-six hours may bo

found in the tissues of the body, and, so far, is conclusive proof that alcohol passes
through the body unchanged. The defect in the proof is, that in no case has the
whole of the alcohol which was taken been collected from the excretions, and

therefore some may have been transfonned ; and the only answer to this assimiption

is, that it is and will be impossible to collect all the products of excretion for so
long a period as the alcohol has been fomid in the body, and that as some alcohol
is proved to leave the body by every outlet for the longest period during which an
experiment can be made, and after this is found in the tissues of the body
unchanged, it is highly probable that the whole does pass out unchanged.

    It is no objection to this statement to affirm that alcohol is an active agent

in the bodj', for a substance may act phj-sically as well as chemically, and it does
not follow that it must change its composition in order to act. The action of

alcohol over the heart, the skin, the brain, and other organs is fully admitted ; but
this fact simply lies parallel with the other, viz. that it is taken into the body as

alcohol, and leaves it as alcohol.
    The digestibility and assimilability of foods must be regarded in three aspects

1st, the kind of food under inquiiy, or its absolute digestibility ; 2ud, the quantity
of a given food which is digested ; and 3rd, the conditions under which the food is
acting. In reference to the quantity of food which can be assimilated, I cite the

instance of cheese ; for my own experiments have shown that bejond a very limited

--amount, the nitrogenous elements of cheese do not reaj^pear as urea that is to say,

whatever may be the quantity of cheese eaten, only a very limited amount of it is

digestel and assimilated. This is important in the case of persons who, not
accustomed to the use of cheese, are compelled to make a large part of their meal
of it, as in prisons where, by the recent alterations, 3 to 4 ozs. of cheese with bread
constitutes the whole of the Sunday's dinner. If only a small portion of the cheese
be digested, there will be a serious waste of food and also a deficiency in the nutri-
tive value of the dinner ; and if, as doubtless was the case, the Committee regai-ded
the cheese as equivalent to a proportion of meat, they have greatly erred. It is one

thing to add a piece of cheese, which may only in part be digested, to a good meal

 (and it will be noticed that wherever meat can be obtained, it is eaten first and the
cheese supplements it), and quite another to make cheese a prime constituent of the
meal. It has been already sho^vn that there are certain poor districts in the kingdom,

--as South Wales, Wilts, Dorset, and Cornwall, where a very large quantity of a

very low-priced cheese is eaten largely in quantities which, measm-ed by their
nutritive elements, might well supplant meat yet the people eat it, not because

                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

they prefer it to meat, and are themselves the worst fed of the whole agi-icultural
country. This is not in favour of the digestibility of cheese, and yet it is under
the advantage that the persons eating the cheese have from their childhood been
accustomed to its use. The same argument might be used in reference to fat, for
it is proved by the excretions that the quantity of fat which can be digested at a
time is very limited ; but I shall not pursue this argument further.

   The effect of the conditions under which foods are digested and required is now
much better known than heretofore. The views of Liebig as to the influence of
climate now require much modification ; for the abstract of the lleport on the
dietaries of India, which I prepared the last year, and which is now published in
                                                                 --

TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  117

 the Transactions for 1863, shows that the absence of meat and fat from the Indian
 dietaries is far less the effect of the climate than of poverty, and that, with the

 exception of the high castes, as Brahmins and others, who reject meat from

 religious scruples, flesh of almost eveiy kind is eaten throughout that vast empire

when it can be obtained. The rivers are scom-ed for fish so small and insignifi-
cant as woidd be rejected by our poor, and is eaten both in its fresh and putrid
 state. Beasts of prey, carrion birds, nay, even snakes, and the most repulsive
kind of flesh, are eagerly sought for by the low-caste Mahomedans and eaten,
whether it has died a natiu'al death or otherwise ; nay, in Bm-mah the inhabitants
refuse to take life, but the animal having died, its flesh is eagerly eaten. More-

over, the quantity is as large as the supply will afford, without any reference to

theories as to the requirements of climate. Similar information has been afforded
by Dr. Livingstone in the hot climates in which he has travelled, but there the

mania for flesh-eating was far greater than anj-thing sho-um in the Indian
Reports. So, on the other hand, the Reports of Dr. Kane and other Arctic
travellers have abundantly proved that the absence of vegetables in the food of
the Laplanders is because such food is not obtainable, for they enjoyed the white
bread of the travellers ; and the exclusive use of flesh and fat is not only because

it is appropriate to the climate, but because it alone can be procured. In the

northern and less rigorous climate of Sweden the peasantry take mixed food very
similar to that of the people of our own country.

   The effect of exertion over the transformation of food is now well and precisely

established, and our knowledge difi'ers somewhat from that of an earlier period.
Thus, because the muscles are used in making exertion, and they are composed of
nitrogenous tissues, it was afErmed, with a great show of truth, that the excretion of
nitrogen in the form of urea must thus be increased ; but it has been proved that the
excretion of carbonic acid by the lungs is the measure of the exertion (for you
cannot move your finger repeatedly ndthout increasing the quantity of carbonic acid
evolved), whilst the lu-ea is not at all or only slightly increased with the most

severe exertion. The former has been most minutely proved by my own experiments,

and the latter has been established not only by myself, but by Bischoff and Yal on
the Continent ; for, singularlj-, whilst I was pro^-iug this by experiments on prisoners
at the tread-wheel, they proved it by a dog working a spit-wheel until exhausted
both similar and most severe kinds of exertion. The explanation of this latter fact

was given by me in the ' Philosophical Transactions ' iov 1861, viz. that urea is a

mixed product of food and tissue, and if muscles during action throw off a larger
quantity of nitrogenous material than occurs at rest, they must absorb and appro-
priate an equally large quantity of nitrogenous food, or they would diminish in
size and weight, and hence the total excretion of the mixed product, viz. of urea,

will be the same.

     University of Eclinhurgh, ^x.

   In recent times it has been maintained that the gases originating from decom-
posing animal and vegetable matters, bad drains, overcrowding, &c., are not only
injurious to health, from the deterioration of atmospheric air, but that they are
the especial causes of certain specific fevers. It has also been supposed that bad
smeDs, especially the smell of frecal matters or of drains, are the evidence of the
existence of these specific morbific causes. Sanitarians and municipal authorities
have succeeded in exciting at the present time a public /eo'ore on this subject, and
a result which, for extravagance and uselessness, can only be compared with the
railway mania which existed some years ago. Gigantic works are being constructed,

having for their object, not the utilization of human excreta, but channels by
which they may be effectually wasted. Millions of pounds are thrown away in

conveying that matter, so necessary for the land and for agricultural purposes, into
our rivers and seas, under the idea that the smells and emanations arising from it
          -- -- ;;

118 REPORT 18G4.

are the source of pestilence, and that it should he removed at an;^ cost. The
following considerations may perhaps serve to correct erroneous views on this

subject:

1. Atmospheric Air, strongly impregnated with Odour of various kinds, is not

necessarily injurious to Health.--This is shown, 1st, in various parts of the world

where odorous flowers are largely cultivated for the manufactm-e of perfiuues.

Strangers, indeed, often complain of headaches in such districts, but anything like

epidemic diseases are unknown. 2. At Paris there is an establishment atMont-

faucon for converting ordure into a dry mass by simple evaporation. It is then

called 2}oudrette, and sold for agricultural piu-poses. The smell to visitors is at

first almost intolerable ; but the inhabitants of the neighbourhood are uncon-

scious of it, and it occasions no disease. 3. The state of the Thames, in 1858,

was loudly complained of in consequence of its putrid odour ; but no disease was

caused by it. 4. The Craigiutiuny meadows, near Edinburgh, have for 200 years
                                                                                                                        The
been  rendered  fertile  by  causing  the  drainage  of  the  city  to  flow  over  them.
                                                                                                                     _

odour is often very bad, but they occasion no uuhealthiness. 6. The drains in

Naples run down to the sea, having large slits in them opening into the streets

and the beautiful bay is rendered foul, close to the shore, with the di-ainage of the

city. This, combined with the sulphuretted hydrogen given off from the volcanic

soil, renders the atmosphere so unpleasant, that the rents of the dwellings, unlike

what exists in other cities, augment as the apartments ascend in the stair. The

latrines in the public hospitals also exhale the most foetid anunoniacal gases. Not-

withstanding, neither in the city nor in the hospitals is fever, and especially

tj'phoid fever, so common as in other cities of the same size. 6. Drs. Livingstone

and Kirk informed me, that in Africa the smell of the mangTove-swamps was

often intolerable, but never productive of disease.

   2. Atmospheric Air, j'roductive of the most dangerous Epidemics, may he quite

Inodorous.-- This has been proved in various parts of the world, as in the marshes

of Essex and Lincolnshire, the low grounds of Holland, the Campagna of Rome,

the Delta of the Ganges, the swamps of Louisiania, the Guinea coast, Jamaica,
and many other places. It has never been known that those who catch inter-

mittent, remittent, or continued fevers, on visiting such localities, have connected

the morbific causes with peculiar smells. It follows that

 --3. TJiere is no necessary Connexion between Smells and deletei-ious Gases. Some

of these have smells, such as sulphuretted hydrogen, whilst others are inodorous,

Nowsuch as carbonic-acid gas.         it is to be observed, that what makes these and

other gases injm-ious is their being so concentrated as to exclude atmospheric air,

or their being pent up in confined places, from which they escape in injurious

quantity. Hence why workmen going down into pits expire, for the same reason

that dogs do in the Grotto del Cano. It has been asserted, however, that smells,

though not injurious in themselves, give indications of danger. One chemist has

maintained that duiiug putrefaction the smell was given off first, and the noxious

vapoiu- afterwards, whilst another declared that the smeU was given oft' last, and

was the proof that all danger had ceased. The first likened smell to the tail of the

lion, which, when seen, gave evidence that the claws and teeth were not far oft";

while the second, continuing tlie simile, declared that a sight of the tail was the

best evidence that danger was departing. I do not believe that smells, as smells,

are injiu-ious to health, nor are they a nuisance to those who live among them

yet one of the great dilficulties in making the sewerage of towns useful in agricul-

ture has arisen from exaggerated notions as to the danger of smells, and the

necessity of deodorization.

 --4. Fresh Sewerage entering into running Streams is not dangerous to Health.

This is shown, 1st, by the state of the Thames in 1858 ; 2nd, by the condition
of the water of Leith, which has been proved by the statistics of Dr. Littlejohn,
officer of health for the city of Edinburgh, to be a more healthy district than others

in proportion to its population, and by Dr. Miller to be equal, in point of health
and as regards death-rates, to the best parts of the town ; 3rd, it is not destructive
to the fish, for, according to Dr. Elliot of Carlisle, the sabnon have increased in
size and weight since the di-ainage of that city was conducted into the Eden,
while it is shrewdly suspected that the famed whitebait of Greenwich and Black-
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                       110

wall actually owe their existence to the peculiar condition of the neighbouring
Thames.

  --5. Typhoid or otlier Fevers cannot be proved to originate from Fcecal Fermenta-

tion or Emanations. It is true that Dr. Murchison has collected numerous cases
where the exposure to such emanations has been coincident with the outbreak of
fever; but numerous striking exceptions exist which are opposed to his conclu-

--sions. In Edinbm-gh, typhoid fever has increased as the drainage of the town has

extended and been improved a residt which has been attributed to an imperfect

water-supply, rendering the water-closets the means of diffusing faecal emanations
through the interior of the houses. If such were the case, fever shovdd increase
largely in autumn, when the supply of water is scarce, whereas it is always most
prevalent in winter, when the water is abundant. Formerly also typhoid fever

was as unknown among those who had water-closets as those who had not. Fur-
ther, it should be remembered that the men who are employed almost constantly
in the great London drains, though so much exposed to their emanations, ai-e not

pai-ticularly liable to fever.

   6. Epidemic fever, and especially typhoid fever, must originate in other causes,

amongst which, besides contagion and infection, may be cited starvation, improper

--quality of food, bad water especially from springs arising in the neighbourhood
--of cesspools or chm-chyards overcrowding, bad ventilation, and tlie numerous

iUs arising from poverty and dissipation. Some, like Dr. W. Budd, of Bristol,
place the cause in a specific vii-us, always emanating from the body, which may
be conveyed by, but never originates in, drains. For my own part, I believe we

have yet to discover the cause producing essential fevers. But while there are so
many sources of fallacy, we cannot be too cautious in accepting plausible explana-
tions, or in acting upon them in our efforts to improve the di'ainage of towns.

On Food as a Source of Entozoa. By T. Spencer Cobbold, M.D., F.R.S.

This subject was brought before the Association in three papers, treating, seve-

rally, of meat, fruit and vegetables, and drink, all of which materials were stated

to be more or less liable to harbour parasites of some kind or other. The author

dwelt upon the Teenia in their mature state, and spoke of their introduction into

the body in a larval condition. There was no doubt that entozoa were intro-

duced with vegetable food. Small mollusks harboured larval parasites in prodigious

quantities; and they were the source of one or more of the parasites that occa-

sionallyjuivaded the human form. These entozoa might be swallowed fi-om water-

drinking; but thev were more likely to be taken from water-cresses, or other

vegetables of the kind. It was necessary, vsdth all vegetables, that the greatest

Acleanliness should be observed in preparing them for the table.    small species

of fluke-worm, discoTered in Egypt, liad been brought to this country ; and if it

became acclimatized, it would be difficult of extermination. Eggs and living

si^ecimens had been found in this coimtry, both in men and monkeys, but only to

a very small extent. He was the fu'st to discover it in the monkey. As to the

little thread-worm, he had never been able to rear it in apples and pears ; and

there was no evidence to show that any species of entozoa was derivable from

fruit. It was not likely that fruit was ever an intermediate habitation for any of
Athe parasites which ordinarily occupied the human body.
                                                                                                                                                                               great many evils in

children were charged to eating imripe fruit ; but, as far as entozoa were con-

cerned, that fear was entirely groimdless. With regard to celery, cabbages, and

all the ordinary market-garden vegetables, he might say that all decomposing

animal and vegetable matter sustained entozoa ; and the more filthy the water or
liquid manure employed to secm-e the fertility of the garden, the more likely were

entozoa to be supplied with the vegetables gi-o'WTi upon the land. The most care-

ful washing was therefore desirable. Parasitic larvfe might be found in water that

was, to  all  appearance, perfectlj^ pure                                                                                                                       but, speaking  generally, spring-water was
                                                                                                                                                             ;

perfectlj' innocuous. The same thing coidd not be said of water stored in large

tanks in hot climates. The people of these islands sufiiered from entozoa, which

must be introduced by drink in some fonn or other. The presence or absence of

the larva3 of human entozoa in water was dependent upon the place from whence

the supply came, and upon the condition of the water. The pork measle might

be readily conmiunicated to himian beings in this way, and it was apt to ensconce

itself in the brain, causing death, which the Registrar- General invariably set down

to cerebral disease. The way in which it reached the brain was from the coats of

the stomach, through the circulating medium. There was one kind inhabiting

dogs, which was often communicated to the human being. One-sixth of all per-

sons who died in Iceland perished from a little creature so small that, in its adult

state, it could scarcely be seen. If neither dog nor wolf existed, we should get rid

of these species altogether. No one need drink water impregnated with these

entozoa. Water to which dogs had no access could not contain them ; neither

were they likely to be found in spring or well water. Open waters into which the

carcases of dogs were occasionally thrown would probably contain them, and the

eggs might be carried to food washed in such water. The danger would be got

rid of if the water was always carefully boiled, filtered, or distilled ; but a filter,

to be effectual, ought not to pass nnything larger than one-thousandth of an inch.

Sand iind charcoal filters were of verj' little use. Paper filters shoidd be em-

ployed. All entozoa not preserved for scientific experiments should be destroyed

by fire, and under no circumstances should they be thrown aside as harmless

refuse and he would press upon butchers, knackers, and others not to throw

doubtful oft'al to dogs. Then as to beer, porter, iSrc. All he need say with regai-d

to these fermented drinks was that he believed them perfectly harmless. Even

though impure waters shoidd have been employed, the boiling of the wort woidd

be alone sufficient to destroy any number of parasites. Unfortunately, we cannot

be perfectly certain about unfermented drinks, such as ginger beer, lemonade, and

the like. All must depend upon the source and the supply of water. They might,

however, conclude that the manufacturer got his supply from the purest source

open to him, and that, therefore, we need be under little or no apprehension. In

regard to wines, the same remarks were applicable. Alcohol, added to water, was

sufficient to destroy the parasitical eggs ; but he questioned whether the amount

of spirit in our home-made wines was sufficient for the pui-pose.

           Valves in the Abdominal Veins. By Edwaeds Ceisp, M.D.

  Up to 1852, the author said, all physiologists had denied the presence of valves

in the abdominal veins, when he discovert d them in the Giraffe ; since this period
he had found them in the splenic, mesenteric, and renal veins of many animals.
So nmnerous were they in some mammals, that the left renal vein of the Nylghau
{S. pictci), which was exhibited, contained ten valves, two single and four pairs.
It was thought by the author that the presence of these valves in the splenic and
gastric A'eins had an important bearing upon the origin of splenic apoplexy. The

author named fifty-fiye animals in which he had discovered yalyes in the abdo-
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  121

minal veins. These included two of the Camaria, one Marsupial, fourteen Pachy-
derms, sixteen Antelopes, eight Deer, and fourteen other ruminants, including the
Alpaca (Auchenia) and Guanaco (C. llama).

On (lie Size of the Blood-corpuscle in relation to the Size of the Animal, its
        Swiftness and Poivers of Endurance. By Edwards Ceisp, M.B.

   The object of the author of this paper was to show that the opinion generally
entertained that the largest animals in the same familj- had always the largest blood-
disks was often erroneous. Among the Quadrumanu there were many exceptions

to this supposed law, as also in the Clieiroptera. In the Camaria, a natural

family, the common Cat {F. domestica) had as large a corpuscle as that of the

Lion {F. leu). In the rodents, the little Harvest-mouse (M. ?nessoriiis) had as

large a corpuscle as that of the common Eat (31. dcmmamis) ; and it was remark-

able that the animals with the largest blood-coiiDUScles might be called aberrant,
as the Elephant {F. indicus), Capybara (H. cajnjbara), and Great Ant-eater

(M.jubata). Among birds, as in the ducks and geese, there were many exceptions
to this rule ; and the reptiles and fishes were more prolific in examples. As regards

the small size of the blood-coi-puscle in relation to higher amount of organization,
swiftness, and powers of endm'ance of the animals, the blood-disks of the Chim-

panzee, Orang, many of the smaller monkeys, race-horse, cart-horse, greyhound,

pug-dog, hare, rabbit, goat, otter, fox, sheep, hog, rapacious birds, sharks, and
others were adduced to disprove this theory. These inferences were exemplified
by a diagram of the blood-coi-puscle of 180 diflerent species of animals, drawn to

scale.

  On the Temperature of the Sexes. By Jony Dayt, M.T>., F.B.S. L. Sj- E.

   Mr. Lewes, in his excellent work on the scientific writings of Aristotle, when
commenting on the dictum of that philosopher, that man has more warmth than
woman, expresses a contrary opinion as established bj' modem investigations.

   The author, from his own observations, supports the statement of Aristotle,
having, in a large number of instances, in which comparative trials were made with
much care, found the temperature of woman a little lower than that of man.

  A priori, he thinks this might be expected, inasmuch as it is an established fact

that man, on an average, consumes more oxygen in respiration than woman, ^^nd

his observations on the temperature of other animals, so far as they extend, have

been confirmatory. As a special example, he compares the temperature of the
male and female of the common fowl. Lender similar circumstances he has found
that of the fonner a little higher than that of the latter, the maximum of the one
having reached 108° -5, the maximum of the other 108°.

      Some Observations on the Horse-chestnut (^sculus hippocastaneum).

                        By JoHX Davy, M.D., F.B.S. L. cf- E.

   In this paper the author gives an account of some experiments made by him on
the nut, the leaves, and the bark of this tree. The nut he foimd composed chieily
of starch, cellulose, and casein, with a little oil and mucilage. In the shell of the
nut, in the leaves, and in the bark he detected tannin and colom'ing-matter.

   He concludes with pointing out some of the uses of the several parts, how the

nut is a nourishing food, especially for sheep, as proved by experience in Switzer-
land, and is likely to be so for pigs, which show no aversion to it ; and further,

how the leaves and shell of the nut and the bark are applicable to dyeing and

tanning and the making of ink. The colour they impart is a good "brown or
yellow ; and when fixed by alum as a mordant, it bears washing in the instance of
cotton and silk. In France another use is made of the nut : crushed by grinding
to the state of a fine powder and mixed with water, it forms an emulsion, which is
employed in the manufactm'e of sUk, woollen, and linen fabrics ; and the refuse, it
is represented, mixed with an equal portion of pollard, proves a nutritive food for
poultry. It has been used also in Paris mixed with flour in the making of bread.

and remarked that some physiologists had endeavoiu-ed to show that it was as easy
to form cells out of unorganized matter as to make organic substances but, from

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

            On the Use of Milk and Scotch Barley as an Article of Biet.
                                    By George Fkean.

   The author suggested that a larger supply of milk might be obtained. It is not
generally known that the Government have a convict establishment at Dartmoor,
in Devonshire. The convicts have been employed in reclaiming waste lands, and,
after various experiments, are allowed to keep cattle. They have at this time
one of the best herds of cows and calves La the coimty, in number 184, producing
upwards of 100 lbs. of butter per week, of delicious taste and quality, and this, too,

on a comparatively small acreage of land, the peat laud yielding nutrition in abun-
dance. This is a sample and experiment on perhaps the worst and most luifavom--

able corner of 80,000 acres of laud. An uustiuted supply of mUk to the childi'en

of the labouring population would lead to the use of iScotch barley, rice, oatmeal,

&c. An excellent beverage may be obtained with Scotch barley and skimmed

milk at small cost.

                On the Vocal Organ of the Corixa, an Aqiuitic Insect.
                                 By E. Gaener, F.L.S.

  mThis insect, when confined a vessel of water, is remarkable in producing a

continuous sound, distinct from any produced by striking the sides ot the vessel.
The legs are elevated simidtaneously with the noise, and friction might be pro-
duced iipon the edge of the elytra, or by means of a projection or process at the
base of the first pair of legs ; there is also a little sac, which is probably accessory

to the soimd, situated at the base of the under-wings on each side, containing a

little club-like body of a shape similar to the poisers of a fly or tipula.

      On the Various Forms assumed hi/ the Glottis.
By Geoege DuNCAi^ Gibb, M.A., M.t)., LL.D., F.G.S.

The author stated that it had been an accepted notion that, for the most pai-t,

the glottis assumed a triangular form ; and this view was taught almost to the pre-

sent horn'. This led him to go into the question of what were the various forms

assumed by the glottis, and in what manner did they arise. In stating this pro-

briefly described the arrangement of, the muscidar fibres, especially as lately made

out by M. Battaille, which he said had much to do in regulating the form of the

glottis. He adopted that author's division of the muscle into three bimdles, and

approved of the name of triceps laryngea, which he had given to it ; he also con-

firmed the accuracy of Battaille's researches. He then entered upon a description

of the manner of action of the various fibres, and its influence in giving a form to

the glottis. This varied from an isosceles, equilateral, or right-angled triangle, to a

lozenge or barrel, circular, oblong, lanceolate, elliptic, pyiiform, or arched and linear

form. The commonest of these was an isosceles triangle ; and a rare form was a

right-angled triangle, which he had never met with unless in women, when the

Alarynx is shallow from before backwards. parallel or oblong glottis he explained,

and showed how it occurred ; he had seen it several times, but necessarily nari'ow,

because the vocal cords, under such circmnstances, could not be separated more

Athan one or two lines at their point of origin.                                                                                                                                                    more remarkable form than any

of these was the reversal of the triangle, the glottis, dming the utterance of conti-

nuous falsetto soimds, assuming the shape of a narrow Y, then a naiTow Y, and

then a narrow oblong, before the termination of the experiment. The cause of

Athis, with an illustration, was given.                                                                                                                                                       pear or bulbous shape, like the new foim

         Note on the Action of the Bromides of Lithium, Zinc, and Lead.
                Bij George Duncaii Gibb, M.A., M.D., LL.D., F.G.S.

   The bromide of lithium was prepared with the view of treating gout and rheu-
matism of the throat and neck. In small doses it acts as a touic, gentle stimulant,
and sometimes as a dim-etic, and may be combined with other agents with advan-
tage. The bromide of zinc was found to relieve impaired nervous power ; whilst
the bromide of lead was proposed as a soothing and cool local agent in certain in-
flamed states of the mucous membrane.

    On the Functions of the Liver. Bij John Goodman, M.D., L.B.C.P.L.

   The functions of this organ are, by the most recent works on physiology,
declared to be of two piincipal kinds, viz. excrementitious and digestive. It is
represented as a_^/<e/-, which purifies by excretion the venous blood; This is not, how-
ever, the main fimction of this organ, but only the result of a more highly important
process. As the great inlkt to the xi/sfemic circulation for the dissolved and soluble
aliment and venous blood, its chief ojjice is the chemical cobrection of these fluids
previous to their admission into the general mass of blood. This it efl'ects as a
highly organized gland by the power of the xttat, force, which it exercises in
common vsith the stomach, lungs, kidneys, &c. By this power it seizes the acids,
acrid, noxious, and oxygenous substances absorbed from the aliment by the vena
porta, decomposes them, and compels them to combine with the free soda
(liberated fi-om the hydrochloric acid employed in digestion), the alkalies of the
aliment and the excess of carbon and hydrogen aniving in the venous blood of
the vena porta ; and to form new compoimds, some of which are secreted in the
various products termed bile, while others thus piuitied and rendered more or less

innocuous are admitted into the systemic circulation, part to be eliminated in the
lungs in the form of carbonic acid and water, and other portions transmitted for
the purposes of nutrition.

 --Proofs. The facts of the non-appearance in the circulation of the blood of acids,
--bile, and other acrid principles previously existing in the aliment, the loss of oxy-
--gen from starch or sugar, when transformed into fat by this organ, the alkaline
--character of the chyle, the absence of b'le in the excreta of Asiatic cholera, and
--in the acid and foetid evacuations of chronic diarrhcea, the presence of acid in the

blood, c&c, in gout and rheumatism, in all which diseases the liver is always defec-
tive in its action, form just and reasonable proofs of these highly important func-

tions of the liver.

On the Hour of Death in Acute and Chronic Disease. By Alfred Haviland.

   The author had collected over 5000 cases of death, with the hour of death and
other circumstances recorded, which he had tabulated and exhibited on a large

chart. He showed, in 1000 cases of death in children under five years of age, that

the periods of the greatest mortality took place during the hours between one and
eight A.M. ; that an extraordinary depression took place in the succeeding hoiu's.

Between nine <and twelve p.m. the rate of mortality was at its minimum. He then

compared these statistics with 2891 deaths from all causes, and the chart showed

how remarkably the wave-lines of death coincided with those above. He then

compared these diagrams with deaths from consumption, which, although they
showed a general resemblance to the wave-line, yet between the hours of four

to eight a.m. there was a depression, when compared with the first four hours'

period. He urged his professional brethren to assist him in his investigations by
foi-warding to him data for further investigation of this interesting subject. He

contended that the tables on the chart proved the extraordinary mortality in the

early hours of the morning, when the powers of life were at theii- lowest ebb, and,

feeding and supporting the patients at their weakest hour, so as to tide them over

a critical period.

                   On the Occurrence of Indir/o in Purulent Discharges.

                          By Dr. W. Bieb Hekapath, F.R.S.

   This paper was on the occurrence of indigo in purulent discharges, in which, after
alluding to obser\-atious made by him to the members of the Medical Association
on two instances which had occurred in his practice, in which he had foimd indigo
in the mine of indiriduals suifering from renal disease, he said that since that period
they had been instructed by Heller, Schunck, Vu-chow, and others that m'ine, even
in the healthy state, contained a substance fi.-om which an indigo-blue pigment
might be obtained in traces or excessively small quantities ; and liletzinsky had
shown them that the mine of the horse and the cow contained a comparatively
large quantitj^ of that pigment-forming substance. It was remarkable, however, that
indigo very rarely appeared to be eliminated directly from the body in its markedly

blue colour. On the contrary, it was thrown ofl' rather in the colourless form, or

as a lio-ht yellow substance, which, upon treatment with acids, split up into three
other substances, two pigments, named m-oglancine or indigo blue, urrhodine or

--indigo red ; whilst a saccharine substance was also separated in a notable quantity,
   thus proving that indican or uroxanthiue is a glucoside. The colouring produced
by fermentation, oxidation, &c., was alluded to, and the author remarked that in
the indigo plant it would be recollected the colom-ing-material did not exist ready
formed, but that it required a peculiar process of fermentation and oxidation, to be

earned on iu the expressed juices of the plant during a considerable period, in
order to obtain that valuable blue in any quantity. The occm-rence of the vege-

table product, indigo, in the fluids eliminated from the human body had been con-

sidered an instance of the deterioration of the animal elements, as remarkable as

the presence of grape sugar in the blood. Sec, of diabetic patients ; but it was now
known that there were numerous proximate principles which, though usually
obtained from the vegetable kingdom, were common to both the animal and
veo'etable worlds. Pathologists and physiological chemists were tolerably weU

aoi-eed that the source of the indigo-forming substance in the animal economy
mioht probably be due to destruction of some of the proteine compounds, and more
especially hrematosin, the well-known coloming-matter of the blood-globules; for
they invariablj' found that the blue pigment predominated in those diseases in
which great destruction of blood-pigment occun-ed, as in phthisis, Bright's disease,
scarlatina, and such like diseases. Dr. Herapath cited a case in which pus or the
liquor pmis had been sho^m to contain bluepigment, and which he believed was the
first instance recorded of that character. The subject of the case was a coachman,
and had been under the author's care for phlegmonous erysipelas of the leg, which
occasioned extensive vesication, and ultimately sloughing of the integuments, from
which woimds large quantities of serum and pus exuded. The spirit lotions em-
ploj-ed in the treatment became rapidly blue in colour, and all the bed-clothes
were similarly stained blue on exposure to the air. Some of the blue-coloured
spirituous solution, set aside in a corked bottle, became shortly discoloured ; but on
ao-ain exposing to an-, its blue colour returned from the influence of oxygen on an
oxidizable material. Other agent.s, as chlorine, chlorinated lime, destroyed the blue
colour, as they would have done in preparations of indigo. The blue-coloured
material was separated on a filter, dissolved in a solution of potassa, when de-
oxidized by sugar, and again separated from impmities by filtering, from which
fluid the indigo was deposited by renewed exposm-e to atmospheric oxygen ; some
of this pigment, fm-ther purified by washing and diying, gave blue-coloured hexa-
gonal prisms on being cautiously sublimed by following Dr. Guy's directions, and
when examined in the microscope had aU the appearances of sublimed indigo,
which the action of other chemical tests confirmed. The som-ce of this pigment

was evidently the purulent secretions of tlie inflamed leg, whicli, by getting mixed
with the spirit lotions, stained the clothes employed, the serum or liquor puris

having previously contained it in a colourless form.

On the Action of the Nervous Tissue concerned in Perception. By W. E. C.

    NoTJRSE, F.R.C.S., Felloiu of the Royal Medical and Chirurr/ical Society,
    and President of the Brighton and Sussex Natural History Society.

   Some approach towards understanding the action of the nervous tissue, con-
cerned in perception, may be gained by enumerating and scrutinizing the struc-
tural and functional conditions essential to that action. The structural conditions
are shown in the well-known microscopical anatomy of the parts. Tlie nervous

tissue is liberally supplied with blood, especially its central and peripheral expan-
sions. This supply of blood is intimately connected with the exercise of the
nervous functions, even with those called mental, since they are heightened, by
increased circulation, enfeebled by diminished circulation, altered by changes in

the blood, and made to cease when circulation stops. Of the functional conditions

attending the action of the nervous tissue, the circulation of the blood is the most
important. The blood stands in relation with the nervous tissue, 1st, as to its
mechanical conditions, which are alterations in its entire quantity, changes in the
quantity circulating in each part, its mutable relations to the calibre of the blood-
vessels, and variations in the rate and force of circulation ; 2nd, as to its chemical
conditions, the addition to it of some vapour or drug, alcohol, opium, chloroform,
and the like, or difterences in the amoimt of its contained salts or water ; 3rd, as
to its chemico-vital conditions, more or less carbonization or oxygenation, more or
less fibrine, albumen, or blood-coi-puscles, more or less recent chyle, or changes
from malassimilation or from actual disease. Under each of these different states
the perceptive power is foimd to vary in strength, in acuteness, and in correctness,
and is often held in abeyance or stopped. It can nevertheless maintain its action

imder many unfavovu'able circumstances. TJiese considerations, though not
explaining in what the nervous action consists, bring us nearer to it, and show

that the function of perception is intimately connected with the healthy and active
blood-nutrition of the nervous tissue and with its waste and repair.

On the Inhalation of Oxygen Gas.  W.By Dr. B.  E,rcirARDSO]sr.

   The paper was supplementary- to one read at the Oxford meeting. The author
said his experiments on the inhalation of oxygen had led him to an almost precise
knowledge of the conditions under which oxygen would most freely combine with
blood. It had been stated, in nearly every modern work on physiology, that
oxygen inhaled in the pm-e form is a narcotic poison. These statements are based
on the researches of Mr. Broughton, in which the late Sir Benjamin Brodie took
part. The observations of Mr. Broughton, in so far as the recital of the pheno-
mena observed by him were concerned, were strictly coiTCct ; but the inferences
that had been drawn from them were nearly altogether incorrect, and were, at the
                                                                 --

best, so narrow as to he comparatively valueless. In fact, Mr. Broughton Lad
seen but one form of oxygen inhalation. The author next stated that the influence

--of oxygen by inhalation was modified (1) by dilution of the oxygen, (2) by dilu-

tion of the blood, (.3) by the activity of the oxygen, (4) bj^ the presence or absence

in the blood of bodies which stop combination. On the point of dilution of oxygen,

Dr. Richardson stated that a certain measure of dilution was requu-ed, not because
the body consumed too quicldy in pure oxygen, but because neutral oxygen would
not combine vsdtli the carbon of the blood imless it were distributed. In atmo-
spheric air the dilution is just sufficient to sustain healthy combination; at 60° F.

the quantity of oxygen may be increased in amount to three parts of the gas to
two of nitrogen, and may be absorbed. Beyond this, the combining power is

reduced, and oxygen is not absorbed. Hence animals die in the gas as it approaches
the pure state ; they die not by a narcotic process, but by a process of negation.

On the point of dilution of the blood, the author said that blood possessing a spe-

cific gi'avity of 10.55 seemed to have most steady power in absorbing oxygen as it

existed in common aii' ; by changing the quantity of water in the blood, imtil

the blood is brought to a specific gravity of 1060, the absoi-ption of oxygen can

be raised to a maximum; but when the specific gravity is more than 1060, the
absorption declines. Below 10.55 the absorption steadily declines in proportion

to the reduction. In respect to the activity of the oxygen, the most differing re-
sults are obtained, according to the activity. If the oxygen be made fi-esh from
chlorate of potassa, even in the piu'e form it sustains life, and the activity of the
functions is increased ; if electric sparks are passed through the gas, or if the

gas be heated to 100°, the same is the fact. On the other hand, if the gas is ex-

posed to ammonia, to decomposing animal matter, or even to living animals over
and over again, it loses its activity, and no longer combines with the blood.
Alcohol, chloroform, opium, and certain alkaline products fomied in the blood in
diseases prevent the absorption of oxygen, and death not uncommonly takes place
from this cause. Great increase of water does the same. After this description,
Dr. Richardson added that the question had often been put, whether the inhalation
of oxygen could be usefully applied in the treatment of disease. Priestly, Beddoes,

Hill, and many of those who lived when oxygen was first discovered, had formed
the most sanguine expectations on this point ; they saw before them an elixir,

if not the elixir vitaj. Chaptal, in spe;ikiug of the effects of oxygen in consump-
tion, said of it, " It raises hope, but, alas ! it merely spreads flowers to the tomb."
Since then various opinions of the extremest kind have been expressed, the differ-
ences having arisen from the entire want of order that has been associated with the

inquiry. One man has used pure oxygen, the other diluted; the one active, the
other negative oxygen. The one has given the gas to anaemic people, whose blood

is sm-charged with water ; the other to diabetic or choleraic persons, whose blood
is of high specific gravity ; the one has given it heated, the other at the tempera-
ture of the day. If even a stick of phosphorus were exposed to oxygen under such
varying conditions, the phenomena obtained would be as variable as those that
have been registered in physic regarding oxygen as a remedy. The difficidties of
 arrivino- at uniform results have been almost insurmountable from another cause
that of obtaining oxygen in a ready fonn for inhalation. Fortunately, this diffi-

culty was now removed. The discovery by jMr. Bobbins of a mode of evohing

oxygen by acting on peroxide of barium and liichromate of potassa with dUute sul-
phuric acid, had given the author the opportunity of inventing a little apparatus
for inhaling oxygen, which could be carried an-ywhere and used at a moment's
notice. In conclusion, Dr. Richardson remarked that his object in bringing for-
ward this short communication was to invite medical men to a method of research

which promised much, and which now might be earned on with certahity of result

 and uniformity of experience.

 --Products of the Combustion of Tobacco. Some recent researches on this subject

had led the author to the fact, that these products are much more complex than
had been supposed. He described an apparatus which was, in fact, an automaton

smoker, by which he had been enabled to have various kinds of tobacco and cigars

smoked by means of a bellows, the smoke which, in the case of a man, would

enter the mouth, being all caught and subjected to analysis. The results of these

inquiries had led him to the determination of the following bodies as products of the

--combustion of tobacco :                                                                                  (1)  water                          (2)  free carbon                                                                (3) ammonia ;     (4) carbonic

 --Physical Projierties of the Component Parts. The water is in the form of vapoUr.

The carbon is in the form of minute particles, suspended in the water-vapour, and

giving to the eddies of smoke their blue colour. The ammonia is in the form of

gas combined with carbonic acid. The carbonic-acid gas is partly free and partly

in combination with ammonia. The nicotine is a non-volatUe body, an alkaloid

which remains in the pipe. The empyreumatic substance is a volatile body, ha'V'ing

an ammoniacal nature, but the exact composition of which is as yet unknown ; it
is this that gives to the smoke its peculiar odom- ; it adheres very poweifully to

woollen materials, and in the concentrated form is so obnoxious as almost to be

intolerable. The bitter extract is a resinous substance, of dark colour, and of in-

tensely bitter taste                                                                                       it is, probably, a                  compound                                                                        body, having  an  alkaloid  as  its

    Variations in different kinds of Tobacco. The greatest variations exist in various

kinds of tobacco. Simple tobacco that has not undergone fermentation yields very

little free carbon, much ammonia, much carbonic acid, little water, none or the

smallest possible trace of nicotine, a vevy small quantity of empyreumatic vapour,

and an equally small quantity of bitter extract. Latakia tobacco yields these same

products only. Bristol bird s-eje yields large quantities of ammonia and very

little nicotine. Turkish yields much ammonia. Shag tobacco yields all the pro-

ducts in abundance ; and the same maj' be said of pm-e Havanua cigars. Cavendish

varies considerably : some specimens, which are quickly dried, are nearly as simple

as Latakia ; other specimens, which are moist, yield all the products in great

abundance. Pigtail yields every product most abundantly. The little Swiss cigars

yield enoi-mous quantities of ammonia, and Manillas yield very little.

 --Physiological Effects of the compounds named above. The water-vapour is inno-

cuous. The carbon settles on the mucous membrane and irritates the throat.

The carbonic acid is a narcotic, if it be received into the lungs. The ammonia

causes dryness and biting of the mucous membrane of the throat, and increases

the flow of saliva ; absorbed into the blood, it renders the fluid too thin, causing

irregularity of the blood-corpuscles ; it also causes, when absorbed in large quan-

tities, suppression of the biliary secretion and yellowness of skin ; it quickens and
then reduces the action of the heart, and, in young smokers, it produces nausea.

The empyreumatic substance seems to be almost negative in its effects, but it gives

to the tobacco-smoke its peculiar taste, and it is this substance that makes the

breath of confirmed smokers so unpleasant. Nicotine is scai-cely ever imbibed by
the cleanly smoker ; it affects those only who smoke cigars by holding the cigar in
the mouth, and those who smoke dii'ty pipes saturated with oily matter : its effects
when absorbed are very injimous; it causes palpitation, tremor, and irregTdar

action of the heart, tremor and imsteadiness of the muscles generally, and great

prostration                                                      it does not, however, produce nausea or vomiting.                                                                                                                           The bitter extract
                                                              ;

IS the cause of vomiting and nausea when it is absorbed ; both it and the nicotine

are always received into the mouth in solution, and produce their effects either by

direct absorption from the mouth or by being imperceptibly swallowed and taken

into the stomach.

 --Mode of Smohiny. The greatest difference arises &om the manner of smoking.

Those who use clean long pipes of clay feel only the eflects of the gaseous bodies

and the free carbon. Wooden pipes and pipes with glass stems are injurious.

Cigars, smoked to the end, are the most injmious of all. To be safe, a cigar ought

to be cast aside as soon as it is half smoked ; and every cigar ought to be smoked
                                                                                                     ;;;

from a porous tube. Cigars, indeed, are more injurious tliau any form of pipe
and the best pipe is unquestionably what is commonly called a " churchwarden "' or

A"long clay." After the clay pipe, the meerschaum is ne.xt in wholesomeness. pipe

with^a meerschaum bowl, an amber mouth-piece, and a clay stem easily removable

or changeable for a halfpenny, would be the beau-ideal of a healthy pipe. All

attempts to construct pipes so as to condense the oil have failed. To be effective

they must be very large and inconvenient. It is of no slight importance, if a
Aman must smoke, for him to be careful of the manner in which it is done.
                                                                                           man

may, by practice, become habituated to a short foul pipe ; but he never fails to

suffer from his success in the end, nor, unless the habit of actual stupefaction be

acquired, is any pleasurable advantage derived. What may be called the soothing

influence of tobacco is as well brought about by a clean porous pipe, or well-niade
cigarette, as by any more violent and dangerous system, while the harm that is in-

flicted is of an evanescent character.

What is the Best Method of Estimating the Nutritive Values of Foods and

                  Dietaries ? By Dr. Edward Smith, F.R.S.

There are four methods in use for the estimation of the nutritive value of foods :

(1)  the weight of the  food                     (2)  the  nitrogenous  and carboniferous  elements  in
                                              ;

food ; (3) the nitrogenous food, carbon and hydrogen (reckoned as carbon), in food ;

(4) the nitrogen and carbon in food.
HowDr. Smith concluded by putting the question,
                                                                        shall we estimate the food
--which is necessary to the system ? by that which any given class of persons is

known to obtain, or by that which a scientific inquiry into the excretions, conjoined

--with a knowledge of the state of the health, would supply ? He said : The former

is open to the fallacy that the persons in question may be over-fed or under-fed,

since their measure of the food is, within limits, that of the means to acquire it

and yet it offers these positive facts, that those persons do live on the dietary in

--question, and, under its influence, have a certain duration of life and a certain yearly

amoimt of sickness values which can be duly estimated when compared with those

of other sections, or of the whole community. Assuming that the class in question

stood high in these evidences of health as compared -with other classes, our confi-

dence woidd be high also ; but it would not thence follow but that another dietary
might yet further tend to improve health and prolong life. The best class in this

and other communities may not have reached the ultima Thtde of health and lon-

gevity. But, with all its defects, it is most desirable that this information should

be within our reach, and that Government should be induced to institute such in-
quiries upon a large scale. Science is under obligations to our own Grovernment

for ha\'ing taken some steps in this direction ; but it remains to urge them to ad-

vance stiil further. So far as I know, no other nation has seriously entered on the

inquiry. The latter method is conclusive when the investigation refers to the

effects of different foods ; for by it, it may be demonstrated what proportion of each

enters the circulation, and in what degree it influences the vital transformations

but when the aim is to ascertain the degi'ee of sufficiency of a whole dietarj', it is

too limited in its scope, since it must be made upon one or a very few individuals,
and could be regarded as undoubted in the conditions only in which it is made ; and

--it assumes that which recent inquiries disprove that there is not gTeat diversity
--in the amount of food which large masses of the people obtain that the differences

lie within not wide limits.

     On Obliteration of the Sutures in One Class of Ancient British SkuUs.

                                   By Dr. J. Thitenam.

The skulls from the Long Barrows of the stone period gave indications of synos-

tosis as a race-character ; and in connexion with this fact, it was worthy of notice

that the great longitudinal sutures close earlier in the inferior than in superior races,
Aand that their early obliteration was an African pecidiarity.
                                                                        comparison of a

number of skulls showed that the elongated form was often coincident with the

early obliteration of the sagittal suture ; but the two things did not usually stand

in the relation to each other of cause and effect, This was only the case when the

                                                                                                          \

obliteration of the sutures, wliicli was congenital, or at least liad occurred in tlie

earliest period of life. This constitutes true si/nostosis, wliich, when affecting- the
parietals, produces the abnormal long' and narrow skull known as scapliocephalus.

i'^acts were adduced which appeared to prove that the dolichocephalous Britons,

in common with other dolichocephalous peoples, were much more liable to synos-
tosis of the parietals than the brachycephalous races ; and that when it occurred it

resulted in an exaggeration of the elongate form natural to the race.
   The author referred to the iinding in a long barrow in Wiltshire, from which

fourteen skeletons had been taken, of a very much elongated scaphocephalic skiUl,

which was marked by the perfect obliteration of the sagittal suture, while the
coronal and all the lateral sutures were open. It was that of a young man, and

evidently not a case of premature senile obliteration. After speaking of the result

of discoveries in Clloucestershire and in other parts of England, Dr. Thurnam gave

a description of an elongate ancient Britisli skull, found at Charlcomb, near Bath,
the transverse depression of which had been thouglit to be caused by the wearing

of a particidar description of head-dress.

   In repl}' to an inquiry, L)r. Thurnam said his observations did not bear out the
impression that the most ancient race of this country was of the same tj'pe with
the brachycephalous one often supposed to have been once spread o\"er the whole of
Northern Europe. The theory was not well sustained, inasmuch as our oldest skulls
were very long and naiTow, whereas in Lapland and Eiumark they were the reverse.

          On a Sui)plementarij Si/stem of Nutrient Arteries for the Lungs.

                        By WiLLi.Iii TuENER, M.B., F.li.S.E.

    In this paper the author described the arterial plexus situated on the side of the
pericardium beneath the mediastinal pleura. It was formed by the junction of a
number of slender, elongated, thread-like arteries, derived fi-om the pericardiac,

mediastinal, and phrenic branches of the internal mammary artery, with each other

and with numerous line branches derived from the trunks of the intercostal arte-
ries. The plexus so formed consisted of a wide and irregular meshwork, and served
to constitute, in the antero-posterior direction, an inosculating medium between the
arteries of the anterior and posterior thoracic walls, whilst inferiorly it inosculated

with the arteries of the diaphragm. From it also a number of slender thread-like
arteries passed to the lung, some in front of its root, others behind, and others be-
tween the layers of the ligamentum latum pulmonis. Through the agency of this

subplem-al mediastinal plexus, an arterial communication is thus established between
the vessels of the lung and the arteries which supply the wall of the chest with

blood.

Review,' January 1865.

            --On Cranial Deformities Triyonoeeplialus.

                       By "William Titkner, M.B., F.E.S.E.

   In this paper a peculiar form of head was described, in which the frontal eminences
were completely absent, and, in consequence, the forehead above the eyebrows
and orbits was tlattened or even concave. In the middle line, however, the fore-
head projected forwards and formed a sort of beak, narrow below at the root of the
nose, but swelling out laterally at the line of the hair. From above, the head looked
broadly ovate, or even somewhat triangular, the apex being at the forehead, the
rounded base at the occiput. The peculiar shape of the head was noticed, in the
case described, at the time of birth ; the child, now between hve and six years old,
was well-grown and intelligent. The head evidently corresponded to the form
termed Triyonoeeplialus by Professor Welcker, of Halle. The author argued that
the production of this form of head was due to a fusion of the two centres of
ossification of the frontal bone, and consequent premature obliteration of the frontal

suture.

               GEOGEAPHY AND ETHNOLOGY.

Address of the President, Sir Eoderick I. Mubchisoij, K.O.B., D.C.L.,
   LL.D., F.R.S., V.P.G.S., Director- General of the Geological Survey, and

President of the Royal Geographical Society.

Intimately bound up as I have been with the British Association since it was

founded, in 1831, let me first assure you that I am proud to have been the person

who, at our last meeting at Newcastle, had the honour of moving the resolution that

we should this year assemble in Bath, a city with which I have long been con-
nected by many dear ties. Twenty-eight years have elapsed since we were gathered
together at the neighbouring city of Bristol ; and now we return, to make this

attractive place the scientific centre of the south-western districts of England,

under the general Presidency of my eminent Geological colleague Sir Charles

Lyell.

  mOur Section of Geography and Ethnology had no existence when we last met

this pai-t of  England                                            but  ever  since its formation thirteen  years ago, as proposed
                                                               ;

by myself, it has been very popular. I may, indeed, assume with confidence that

it will remain so, as long as England continues to be distinguished in sending out

to distant lands so many entei-prising travellers and explorers. From the days of

Edward the Sixth, when an expedition sailed, under the eyes of that young king,

to discover a north-eastern passage to the mighty empire of China, then called

Cathay, and downwards, through the voyages of the illustrious Raleigh, and

others of the reign of Elizabeth, to our own times, the same spirit has animated

the adventurers of this nation.

   Having already in this summer taken a view of the last year's progress of geo-

graphy, in an Address to the Royal Geographical Society, I will on this occasion
chiefly direct your attention to some points of general interest, which have marked

the advancement of our science during the last forty years.

   To begin with one of the great glories of this century, let us call to mind how

little was known of the Arctic regions when Parry made his first explorations,

and how, after being followed by many a gallant voyager, the culminatmg Arctic

honour devolved upon a single English woman, who, devoting her fortune to the

search after her noble-minded husband, engaged the services of that successful

navigator, M'Clintock, and determined the cheering fact that, in perishing, Fi-ank-

lin was the first to make the long-sought north-west passage.

The delineation of all the Arctic discoveries upon the map of the world, with

the memorable exception of the American voyage of Kane, as sent forth by Grin-

Newnell of     York, is, indeed, exclusively due to British energy, and is a trophy

well worthy of the country which accomplished so much in its earlier career of

enterprise in the little vessels of a Drake, a Frobisher, and a Hudson.

To pass to the vast region of our antipodes, or the furthest from our homes, let

us remember how small was the portion of Australia known a quarter of a century

ago, in comparison with that which our countrymen now occupy. The great in-

terior was then almost a terra incoynita, the larger part having been pronounced to

be an useless desert. Recently, however, it has been successfully traversed by

Stuart, M'Kinlay, Burke, Wills, and Landsborough, and is known to contain so

much fertile land, that sheep are foimd to thrive well in tracts which were con-

sidered to be mere saline wastes. The discovery of a vast abundance of gold has

doubtless been one great cause of the rapid strides latterly made in Australia, par-

ticularly in raising the rich auriferous colony of Victoria to a degree of commercial

prosperity which, for its rapid gTowth, is iineqnalled in our history. But even in

the colony of South Australia, where the precious metal has not been found,

though it is rich in copper-mines, we have seen the spirit of adventure, in search

of new pasture-lands, lead to vast geographical discoveries, in making which

M'Douall Stuart traversed the continent, and planted the British ensign on its

northern shores. Again, if we look at the promising and fertile new colony of

Queensland, on the north-eastern coast, we see an importunt question of climate

all but decided, in a direction contrary to the opinion of most men a few years

back. For we now know that broad tracts of intertropical land of a certain alti-
                                                                              --

tude, sufficiently removed from a warm ocean, and well clothed with vegetation,

will permanently support large flocks of sheep, even as far as S. latitude 18°.

   Whilst the coasts and extensive parts of the interior of this new British con-
tinent have heen occupied, there still remained one grand desideratum, which
scientific research could alone supply. The most direct route to our important

colonies of New South Wales and Queensland, particularly that portion Ijong

between these and the Indian Seas, was to a great extent sealed to our commercial
marine, owing to the dangerous navigation through Torres Straits, which occa-
sioned tlie very frequent loss of vessels on the numerous coral-reefs fringing the
eastern seaboard of Australia. Thanks to the persevering skill, under a thousand

difficulties, of British naval sm-veyors, the dangers have at last been so clearly

defined and laid down on charts that a broad and deep channel, ensm-ing safe and
regular navigation, has been made available to all navigators.

 --If we carry our view to the south of Australia, it is no longer the north of New

Zealand, with its capital, Auckland now, unhappily, the seat of a bloody war
which most interests geographers*. Apart from the material prosperity of the
Middle Island, and the discovery of much gold near its southern end and in the
Scotch colony of Otago, the grandest scenes of nature have, by the researches of
Hector, M'Kerrow, and Ilaast, been opened out to us in the gorgeous forests
which fringe the gigantic glaciers, and in the deep fiords, or bays, of its western

coasts.

   Glancing northward, from Australia to om- Asiatic possessions, we have before

us that great Indian Archipelago, the chief characters and details of which were

first made known to us by my gifted friend and associate at this Meeting, Mr.

John Crawfurd. In later years this most interesting archipelago has been visited

by Mr. A. R. Wallace, one of those skilful travellers whom it is my special busi-

myness, and, indeed,  great pride, to extol. Disdaining tlie search after the pre-

cious metals, and all the lures of traffic, this excellent naturalist has examined all

the natural-history productions of those islands, from the mighty Borneo to the

small isles bordering the Poljmesian Sea and Australia.

Just such another disinterested and truth-loving explorer of distant realms is

Mv. H. W. Bates, now acting as one of our Secretaries ; who, having gone out on

the same scientific venture with Wallace, in a previous voyage to South America,

remained, during eleven years, collecting those materials which have enabled him

to lay before his countrymen that instructive and pleasing book ' The Naturalist

on the Amazons.'

  As I ha^e thus wandered to South America, let me remind you of the fact that

our senior Secretary, Mr. Clements Markham, has not only travelled over the

mountainous regions of Peru, but has turned those travels to a great national pm--

Eose. He has, in fact, with the aid of Mr. Spruce, been the collector of those

  inchona-plants, or Jesuit's bark, which afford the best quinine, and, transplant-

ing them to suitable sites in India, has laid the ground for saving, not only a

needless expenditure, but also the lives of many a colonist and soldier.

This consideration has brought us to British India, of which an accurate trigo-

nometrical sm'vey has been can-ied up to the highest summits of the Himalaya

Mountains, and over the grand glacial regions which extend from Western Thibet

to Nepaul. In preceding years the interest of the public had been attracted to the

sun^eys of the Himalaya Mountains ; and their extreme height having been esti-

mated to be upwards of .30,000 feet, we thus learnt that the northern frontier of

British rule in India exceeded in altitude the loftiest peaks of the Andes by about

the whole height of the highest mountain in Britain.

It had been svipposed that some depressions in the ocean would be found to

balance in depth the extremest heights of land, and this anticipation has been

exceeded ; for soundings in the South Atlantic, between America and Africa, have

--shown depths of more than 40,000 feet. If these measurements be reliable for
--there is some reason to doubt them the depth beneath the surface of the sea, at

   * Dr. Hochstetter, one of the scientific men of Austria, in the voyage of the ' Novara,'
who has already written very ably upon the physical geography and geology of New

Zealand, is about to produce a still larger work thereon, which will, I hope, be translated

into English.

                                                                          9*

certain points, far exceeds the heights of the loftiest mountains above it. Another
and still more startling- result of modern research is the ftxct that, in dredging the
bottom of the North Atlantic Sea, living starfish were brought up from a depth

of a mile and a half, and were alive, even preserving their colour, when examined

on the spot by Dr. Wallich.

   If we turn for a moment from the advances iu geographical research made by
our own countrymen, we must admit that, of all foreign countries, Russia has of
late years been most eminent in this respect. The Geographical Society of St.

Petersburg wields not only the power and influence of the Imperial Government
of Russia, but receives also large grants of public money, which have enabled it
to carry on simultaneous researches in the steppes near the Caspian and in the

Caucasus, and also to describe the grand natural features of Central Asia, the
boundaries of the Chinese Empire, and the whole river-sjstem of the mighty

Amur with its numerous ailkieuts. In this way serious geographical errors have
been corrected and new features laid down (by positive observations) on maps;
whilst the natural history of the animals and plants, as well as of the human

inhabitants of large regions, of which little was previously known, has been fully
developed. These data are accompanied by ethnological and statistical descrip-
tions of the inhabitants of Eastern Siberia, of the great island of Saldialin, of Mon-
golia, and the new territory of the Russians on the right bank of tlie Ussmi River,
with its coast-lino extending southwards almost to Japan. Of the latter region,
indeed, we had, until \'ery recently, only the most imperfect knowledge.

   Returning to the labours of our o^vn coimtrymen, I might expatiate for a long

time on their discoveries in other distant lands. E-\en in the vast ancient empire

of China, so civilized in many respects, it is but of late years that its gi-andest
river, the Yangtsze-lviang, was opened out to British commerce, through the

energy of the Earl of Elgin and Captain Sherard Osborne ; whilst the upper part
of this mighty stream has since been followed to 1800 miles above its mouth, and

admirably laid down on a detailed map by Blakiston.
   Then, agaui, we hope to welcome here that indefatigable explorer of various

distant lands, our Medallist, Sir Robert Schomburgk, on his arrival from Siam,
where he has been British Consul-General for several years, and of which peculiar
kingdom he is thoroughly well qualified to give you a most interesting account.

   Omitting almost entirely to notice Avhat foreign geographers and ethnologists
have accomplished, I have touched thus briefly upon some of the researches of our
countrymen, because I address a Section of the British Association ; but I must

not occupy too much of your time by retrospective views when we ought to be

gathering fresh fruits.

   There is, however, one subject for your consideration, on which I must say a few
words. Whether judging from the great advances which have been mentioned,
or from what you may have heard or read elsewhere, j^ou must not for a moment
imagine that so great have been the discoveries, that our vocation as explorers of
new lands is likely to come to an end. On this point men of high intellectual

attainments, who do not carefully considt maps, are apt to be deceived ; and I wUl

therefore indicate a few of the grand geographical problems which remain to be

solved.

   At the last anniversary festival of the Roy.al Geographical Socioty, the Right

--Honourable W. Gladstone, after congratulating geographers on their successful

progress, thus addressed them : " There is nothing to do now but to congTatulate

you on your proud position, and to express a confident hope that you will go on as you
have done. The only apprehension which I think the most sensitive of your friends
can entertain, is one connected with the approaching exhaustion of that scene to

--which, at present at least, yom- laboiu's are confined I mean the limited surface of

the globe itself. Alexander, in his day, thought he might reach a point in his

career when he would desire to have new worlds to conquer. You, too, gentlemen,

seem likely, at some time or other, to reach that point."

  Now, whatever meaning my eloquent friend may have attached to the words
" some time or other," let me assm-e you. Ladies and Gentlemen, that that time is

indeed very remote, as you wiU admit when I simply lay before you a few facts re-
specting certain distant regions, You will then see how very long a time must

elapse before we and our posterity can hope to clear away the ignorance respecting
a large portion of the earth which now prevails.

Looking first at the most recent maps of Afi-ica, see what enormous lacunpe hare

to be tilled in, and what vast portions of it the foot of the white man has never

trodden. True it is that large tracts north of the equator have been described by

Gennans and French, as well as by Engiisli expeditions, particularly that in which

Earth was so distinguished.

With the exception, however, of Abyssinia and the snowy mountain Kilimand-

joro, explored by "S'on der Declien and the late Richard Thornton, few of these

tracts have been laid down on detailed maps. In the central eci[uatorial region, but

for the example set by the three gallant oiheers of our Indian armies, Eurton, Speke,

and Grant, and encouraged and supported, I rejoice to say, by the Eoyal Geogra-

phical Society, those countries would have remained as unkno-n-n as they have been

throughout all history, from the days of Ptolemy to our own. Eut if thus a chief

water-basin of the White Nile has been boldly outlined, how much does there re-

--main to be done in order to test the value of the anticipations of Dr. Eeke still

more, to complete a general sketch even of the geography of equatorial Africa! Is

it not essential that the Victoria Nyanza of Speke, a body of water as large as

Scotland, which has only been touched at a few points on its southern, western,

and northern shores, should have all its shores and aflluents examined ? And do
not the Mountains of the Moon of the same explorer invite a survey ? Have we

not yet to find out the source of the great Zaire or Congo, and trace that river to

its mouth ? And who has yet reached the sources of the mighty Niger ? Again,
when we cast an eye do%^m the map southwards, are we not still in ignorance of the

drainage and form of a prodigious extent of country between the Tanganyika Ijake

of Burton and Speke, and the Zambesi and Shire of Livingstone ? Are we not at
this moment most anxious to determine, by positive observation, whether there

exists a great series of lalces and rivers proceeding, as Cooley has suggested, from

Tanganyika on the north to Lake Nyassa on the south ? and has not Livingstone's

very last effort been du-ected to this point ?

If Central Africa is ever to advance in civilization, and its inhabitants are to be

brouglit into commercial relations with Europe, one of the best chances of our ac-

mcomplisliing it will, in my opinion, consist rendering the great White Nile a

highway of intercourse and traffic. And if the present ruler of Egypt shall bring

about this most desirable end, by putting a stop to the lawless slave-trade, carried

on beyond his frontiers under the guise of dealing in ivory, and by establishing

marts of commerce on the bank-s of tlie great river, Africa will owe more to him
than to any ruler since the days of the Roman Emperors, who, though they tried,

never succeeded in opening out the regions around the headwaters of the Nile.

In touching upon this subject, I have to congratulate you on the news which has

arrived, that that chivalrous explorer, Mr. Samuel Baker, is successfully examin-

ing the central equatorial regions, from which, I trust, he will bring us the solu-

tion of some of the problems already adverted to, and will determine the real source

of the waters which supply the Luta N'zige of Speke and Grant.

I have also to announce that Earon von der Decken has proceeded on his bold

adventm-e to explore the interior of Africa from the east coast, by ascending the

Juba, or one of the adjacent rivers, with two' river-steamers constructed at his own

cost.

In making these allusions to African discovery, most heartily do I congratidate

mygeographers on tlie safe retm-n of  excellent and disinterested friend Livingstone.

Already, after his first two great traverses, from east to west and from west to east,
across South Africa, this midaunted missionary had won for himself imperishable

renown. Eut now, after a second expatriation which has lasted upwards of six

years (his previous journeys occupying sixteen years), during which he has been

laboiu-ing conjointly to improve the condition of the natives and to extend geogra-

phical knowledge, he conies home with a firm resolution to adhere to his noble

calling for the benefit of the natives, and to return to that country in which the

black man must bless his name

The return also of Captain Eurton, from the Congo and Fernando Po, ensm-es

for us some fresh and pregnant communications respecting Western Africa ; and

when we know that Francis Galton, though much occupied ^vith the duties of a

General Secretary, will always take part in our discussions, and that Earth * is

likely to be present, it is probable that we shall have a concourse of travellers
capaiole of illustrating the geography and ethnology of Africa, such as was never

assembled at any former meeting.

   If we turn to America, we find that an adventurous gentleman of Chili, Senor
Don GuiUermo Cox, has described a new route across the Andes, which, by almost

bringing together the waters flowing into the Atlantic and Pacilic, is likely to open
out commerce between fertile regions on the west and Buenos Ayres on the Atlantic.

Aware of our almost entire ignorance of the interior of Patagonia, the same bold
traveller pui-poses to make a journey throughout this enormous unknown region

down to the Straits of Magellan.
   In mentioning these straits, I am boimd to remind you how, in former years, that

eminent nautical surveyor Admiral FitzRoy, when accompanied by the great na-

 tm-alist Charles Darwin, threw a flood of light upon the configuration and struc-
 ture of the coasts of South America and the Falkland Islands. Now, although in
 this short and popidar Address I cannot do j ustice to all the advances which have

been made in meteorology, it gratifies me to direct your attention to the recent

 important labours in that science of the same gallant oflicer. For, by well-digested
 comparisons between the state of the barometer and the direction and force of the
 winds, Admiral FitzEoy has proved to the nation what useful interpreters in his

 hands are these natural phenomena. By his forecasts of approaching stonns and
 the prompt use of the electric telegraph, he has saved many a ship and the lives of

 numbers of our seamen.

    If we range from the south to the north of America, numerous indeed are the
 tracts which call for examination ; and even at this meeting I hope to see new fea-
 tures pointed out to us in that northern prolongation of the Kocky JMountains,

 which separates the sources of the Saskatchewan on the east from those of the
 Thomson and Fraser rivers of British Columbia on the west. This knowledge,
 acquired, under great privations, by young Viscount Milton and his friend Dr.
 Cheadle, comes to us here in addition to what had been gathered together by Pal-
 liser. Hector, and Blakiston, as published in a Parliamentaiy Blue Book, and has

 fortimately arrived in time to improve a highly valuable map of British North
 America, which, derived from original documents, is now about to be issued to the

 public by that sound practical geographer, John Arrowsmith, who, in virtue of the

  great services he has rendered to geographical science, most worthily obtained a

  gold medal of the Eoyal Geographical Society.

    Let me next remind you that we are yet entirely in the dark as to the true geo-

  graphy of the interior of Arabia. It is ind(;ed only v^ithiu the last few months that,

  travelling in the guise of a physician, tlie spirited and eloquent Palgrave has been
  the first intelligent person to traverse that country to the I'orsian Gulf. Can any

 one who recently heard this traveller nan-ate his adventures before the Geographi-
 cal Society ever forget the deep impression he made upon the crowded audience
 when he told us his wondrous x\rabian Nights' tale ? In a word, we must confess
 that modem geographers are infinitely less acquainted with Arabia than the ancients

 --and their great geographer Ptolemy.
     Again, in Asia though Russia has very recently, as I have said, done much in

  the north, and the English in the far south-east of that quarter of the globe--the

  very last communication to the Royal Geographical Societ)', proceeding from the

  zealous Hungarian M. Vambery, who travelled disguised as a Dervish, or holy
  Mohammedan beggar, has brought vi-\'idly to our minds a consciousness of the
  little we know of the vast countries once ruled over b}^ Genghis Khan and Timur ?

  In truth, the passage to the ancient capital Samarkand across those regions has of
  late years become infinitely more difiicult than in the days of jMarco Polo. Then
  (1390), and even in 1405t, when an embassy from Henry the Third of Spain to
  the great Emir Timur reached Samarkand, the wide-spread influence of Genghis
  Khan still subsisted. From that distant day there is no record of any European

having visited Samarkand until the year 1841, when the Emir of Bolihara requested
the Emperor Nicholas to send scientific men from Russia to search for gold. This
Imperial expedition, wliich visited Samarkand as well as Bokhara, was purely
scientific, and consisted of two officers of the School of Mines, ButeniefF and Bo-
goslowski ; a very able j'oung naturalist, Lehmauu, since dead ; an interpreter

and that eminent geographer Khanikolij who, at the Meetings of this Association

held at Oxford in 1860, gave us such an interesting account of other parts of Cen-

tral Asia*.

   On the whole, however, as M. Vambery will tell us, those regions are so occu-

pied by savage warring Turcomans and other Tartars, that the solitary traveller is
more decidedly shut out from them than he is from Arabia, China, Africa, and other
countries, in which so many great problems also remain to be solved.

   No region certainly calls more for the examination of geographers than Asia, the
cradle of the human race; and, albeit the Russians, independently of their researches
in Bokhara and Samarkand, have made notable explorations from Siberia into Mon-

golia, and southwards to the borders of China and Japan, Sir Henry Rawlinson will,
I hope, explain to you what extensive regions there are which require to be explored
and defined between Nineveh and Babylon, the countries of his memorable exploits,
and the British empire of the East. There, even at this day, no one has followed
the grand river Burhampooter from Hindostan into China, though the project has

often been agitated, and wiU, I trust, soon be accomplished.

   Again, are there not other vast tracts in the New World which no scientific
traveller or explorer has yet visited ? Cannot our Secretaries, to whom I have

already alluded, point to many a district, nay, to whole regions, which call for ex-
amination ? Ask Mr. Clements Markham how much there remains for the geo-
grapher to do along the great Cordillera of the west ? Then let Mr. Bates speak

to you, as I tinist he will at tliis meeting, of the enormous countries watered by the
affluents of the mighty Amazons, which still call for fresh researches.

   Without further dwelling, as I might, upon numberless new fields for explora-
tion, I hope that I have now satisfied you that the apprehension of geographers
having already done .so much that tliey will soon have little or no work to perform,
is quite imaginary ; for you may rely upon it, that the most ardent and adventurous
men, whether geogTaphers, ethnologists, or naturalists, wiU find stout employment
for many a long year.

   If I were to extend my observations to those boundless branches of our subject

comprehended under the term Physical Geography, which only come into play after
the discoveries of new lands have been made, this Address woidd necessarily be

swollen to undue dimensions. In fact, physical geogi'aphy embraces the consider-

ation of the last of the long series of geological changes, as well as of all natural
operations in the historic period, and the geographical distribution of man, animals,

and plants. Nay, more ; in the hands of so skilfid an exponent as Maury, it in-
volves continual researches into the condition and relations of the ocean and the

expedition left Orenburg I was myself in that city and on the Kirglhs steppes, and saw

what a continuous trade and intercourse took place, as of old, between Russia and Bok-

hara. It is much to be regretted tliat the English pubhc are so httle acquainted with

such facts as are mentioned by the Russian explorers. For example, and independently

of science, M. Lebmann has left an accoimt of the very fi-icndly relations which existed

between the Russian officers and our unfortunate countrymen Stoddart and ConoUy, who,

shortly after the departm-e of the Russian Mission, were barbarously murdered by order

of the Khan of Bokhara. M. Klianikolf lias, indeed, himself assured me that he tried in

vain to induce our officers, who had had disputes with tiie Emir, to leave the country

with the Russian Mission, being convinced that they ran great risk by remaining in tho

power of a lawless fanatic. I am indebted to a Russian gentleman, M. Hippius, wliose

notice wiU be communicated to tliis meeting, for recalling my attention to tliese facts.

Viewed in this broad sense, geogTaphy is, indeed, of siii-passing importance, and the

field for the range of our noble science becomes really unlimited f.

   Let us therefore hope tliat at this meeting we may gather together a few shreds

of that augmenting Ifnowledge of foreign parts wliich the wandering habits of our

countrymen have led them to acquire, respecting the outlines and structure of vari-

myous countries, their inhabitants and natural products, and thus justify                                                                                                               anticipa-

tion, that the Bath 3Ieeting -v^-ill be second to no one which has preceded it in the

interest of the Geographical and Ethnological communications which will be laid

before us.

In conclusion, I have a just pride in quoting the animating and truthful words

which Mr. Gladstone recently addressed to geogTaphers, inasmuch as they cannot

be too widely known, and will, I am sure, be warmly applauded by this Assembly :

" It is the love of adventure," said the eloquent statesman, " it is the boldness in

facing danger, it is the strong self-reliance, it is the ready presence of mind, it is
all that constitutes that powerful individuality which lies at the root of the whole

greatness of this country, and which likewise has lain at the root of the great-
ness and the perfonnances of geographers. The very same causes which have

made you distinguished as a Geogi-aphical Society, are tliose which have made
England distinguished among the nations of the world."

Notes oil the Maories of New Zealand, with Suggestions for their Pacification

   The author specified the causes which led to the New Zealand wars of 18G0 and
1863, in the former of which he commanded a regiment. He believed that a
great wrong had been done to the ^Maories, whom he described as a generous and

improving people, snftering imder the prejudices and selfishness of tJie lower class
of English settlers. The plan he suggested for their pacification and presen-ation
was forming them into agricultural colonies, teaching them husbandly, and en-
couraging them in trade.

On the Ethnologif of Camhodia. Bg Dr. A. Bastian, of Bremen.

The author remarked that, the more the extent of the splendid stone monuments

which spread over Cambodia, Laos, and tlie adjoining pro\inces of Cochin-China

becomes known and investigated, ihe more urgently will rise the demand on

scientific research to solve the problem of their construction. As the chronicles of
Cambodia are quite modern, and as on the early annals of the Siamese no reliance

can beplaced, one naturally l<.>ol>s for inCoruialion to another neighbouring state

Tonquin, which, tlianks to its Cliincso civilization, presents something like Chinese

regularity and order in its rccoids. Till now, however, the studv of Tonquinese

history has been bare of any valuable n suits. In the eastern part" of the province

ofBindinh was discovered, some years ago, amidst the jungle, a large town in

ruins, consisting of fifty towers, wliich were ornamented with figures of men
Aand animals, and surrounded ^vith a square M-all of white stone.

veller, who visited Cambodia in llie year 1295, speaks of fiftv-four towers in the

capital, each containing the statue of a deity, with a serpent 'in its hand (as it is

seen in Java), to ward ofi" those passing. The ruins of Nakhon Vat were likewise

accidentally discovered by tlie Cambodians in the year 1570, after having lain

buried in_ the jungle  for many centuries                                                                                                                and, in  travelling  over the  frontiers  be-

     On the Delta of the Amazons. By H. "W. Bates, Assist.-Sec. B.G.S.

   The area which geogTaphically constitutes the Delta of the Amazons forms an
irregular triangle, measurmg about 180 miles each way. Contrary to what might
be expected in the mouth of a gi'eat river l.png on the equator, the country in and
around it has a pleasant .and salubrious climate. The islands and neighbourin"-
mainland are not formed wholly of fluvial deposit : this is the case only with a

portion of the area, 120 miles distant from the sea, the remaining poriion, or that

lying nearest the sea, having a rocky base and a sandy soil, the product of the dis-
integration of the rocks. The author concluded that this alhnial portion of the area
was the true delta, and that at no very distant period the seaward portion of the

present delta fomied a series of islands lying off the mouth of the river. These
islands he proved to be of great antiquity by an analysis of their fauna, which
shows (in the groups examined) a large proportion of endemic species. The strong

affinity of the fauna of the south side of the delta with that of Guiana also tended
to show that the two regions could not have been formerly separated by a gulf 180

miles wide, impassable by these species. Had this been the case, the southern

margins would more naturally have been peopled from Brazil further south, there
bein^ no known banier to hinder the migration of species from this direction. All
the facts furnished by the physical geography and tlie ftiuna pointed to the residt,

that an ancient tract of land or chain of islands bridged over the space between

Guiana and what are now the southern borders of the delta.

An Account of the Human Bones found in TvmuU situated on the Cottesiuold
                                 Hills. ' By -Dr. H. Bird.

 --The barrows and tumuli on the Cotteswold Hills vary in their size, structure,

and contents. They are of two kinds round tumuli and long barrows. The

round tumuli are roughly constructed, and a kist is generally placed near the centre.

The kist may contain the bones of one or many human bodies of different ages

and both sexes, and flint-flakes and black rude pottery. The long tumuli or

bari-ows are constructed in a superior manner. The bones found in the round

tumuli indicate a peculiar race. They are tall, stout, square-built, and athletic,

varying in height from five feet six inches to above six feet. They had long oval

heads with large bases, widt^ and expanded behind, nan-ow, low," and contracted

in front. Tlie human remains discovered in the long barrows differ from those of

the round tumuli, and are often mixed. Most of the higher-developed skulls,

found in  the  vaults of  the   long  tumuli, were   broken across the vertex                                                                                               and Dr.
          has  suggested  that  such  broken skidls                                                                                                                      ;

                                                     found at Eodmorton tumulus may-

have been broken before death, being the remains of murdered prisoners, or of

persons slain for sacrificial purposes. Dr. Bird described some of a large collection

of bones which he had taken from the tumuli, expressing an opinion, from the

difference in configuration of some of the skulls, and some slight diflference in the

--thigh bones, that some were the remains of an inferior race the aborio-incs of the

coimtiy--and others of a superior race that had made incursions into 'them from

other lands. He contended, too, that the flints which he had found were iden-

tical in character with tliose recently discovered abroad, and which were held as

proofs of an earlier history than that current among us.

miles, -with a population of about 150,000. The Customs of the Dahomans are
divided into Grand and Yearlj^ The Grand Custom takes place only after the
death of a king. The last Grand Customs were performed, in November 1860,

by Gelele, the present sovereign, to honour the name of his sire Gezo. Eeports

from the Wesleyan missionaries show that very little change has taken place as
regards the number of victims during two-thirds of a centuij. The Yearly Cus-

toms were first heard of by Europe in the days of Agaja the Conqueror (1708-27).

They form continuations of the Grand Customs, and they periodically supply the

departed monarch with fresh attendants in the shadowy world. The number of

victims at the Annual Customs has been greatly swollen by report. During the

author's second ^'isit to Agbome forty men were put to death, an equal number of
women presumably being sent to the next world ; but if so, the execution took
place within the palace. The men were all criminals and war-captives: no innocent

--and of these Zan Nyanyana, or "Bad Nights," there were two January 1 and

January 5, 1864. The public stay within doors under pain of death, and the king

personally superintends the executions. Some are cluboed ("am7)uizzati"); others

are beheaded by the Mingan, or premier. After death the bodies are exposed in

the Uhunjro market-place for a few days. The men, attired as during life, in shirts

and nightcaps, are seated in pairs upon Gold Coast stools, supported by a double-

storied scaffold, about 40 feet high, of rough beams, two perpendiculars and as

many connecting horizontals. Between these patibula are galleries of thin posts,

about 30 feet tall, with single or double victims, hanging head downwards ; cords,

passed in several coils round the ankles and above the knees, attach them to the

cross bar of the fatal tree. These tokens of the king's piety are allowed to renuiin

exposed for several days, after which they are thro'\\m into the city ditch. It is

not, however, at the Customs that the great loss of life takes place. Whatever

action, however tiivial, is performed by the king, it must dutifully be reported to
Ahis sire in the shadowy realm.
                                 victim, almost always a war-captive, is chosen

the message is delivered to him, an intoxicating draught of rum lollovdng it, and

--he is despatched to Hades in the best of humour. Captain Burton continued : " I

heard of only one case where the %dctim objected to lose his life. Even those who

were prepared for the Customs (which I witnessed) sat looking at the various

ceremonies, healing time to the music, and eyeing all my movements. At my request

the king pardoned about half of them, but no man thanked me. There are two

--ethnological peculiarities in Dahome which require notice the corporeal duality

of the king, and the precedence of women over men. The monarch is double

--two kings in one. Gelele, for instance, rides the city, and Addo-kpou governs the

bush that is to say, the comitry and farmer folk. The latter has his palace, about

six miles from the capital, his high othcers, male and female, his wives and eunuchs.

Moreover criminals and victims are set apart for him at the Customs. With

regard to the position of women, it must be remembered that the king has two

comts, masculine and feminine. The former never enter the women's palace ; the

latter never quit it except on public occasions. The high officers of Doth courts
correspond in name and dignity : there are, for instance, the female " Min-gan "

and the male " Min-gan," the she-Meu and the he-Meu, and the woman offutcr

is called the " No," or, mother of the man. Strangers also tind maternal parents.

There is, for instance, an English "mother," who expects presents from her

protef/es. Some resident merchants have two " mothers," one given by the late,

the other by the present king. Rovalty itself is not exempt; there are "mothers"

for all the deceased rulers. The origin of this exceptional organization is, I believe,
the masculine physique of the women, enabling them to compete with the men in

bodily strength, ners'o, and endurance. The custom is of old date in Yoruba ; and

--our histories depict the " Mino" (" om* mothers " Aidgarly called amazons), before

the birth of the late King Gezo, who used to boast that he had organized a female-

army. He ordered every Dahoman to present his daughter, of whom the most

palace. Of Gelele's so-called amazons about two-thirds are said to be maidens

a peculiar body in Africa. The remaining third have been married. Tliat an ele-

ment of desperation might not be wanting, women liable to death are " dashed " to

the king, and are dnly enlisted. The fighting women are not de facto married to

the present ruler a father was one of his colonels. The amazons affect male attire,

especially when in uniform. There is nothing savage or terrible in tlieir appearance.

When young, they are compellod to dance and to take ^iolent exercise, which ren-

ders them somewhat lean ; and, as they advance in years, they grow in weight. The

soldieresses are not divided into regiments. There are, however, three distinct

bodies, as in the male army. The Fanti company takes the centre, and represents

the body-gucard. The king generally pays " distinguished strangers " the compli-

ment of placing them in command. I had this honom-, but was not thereby enti-

mytled even to inspect                                        corps.     The Fanti women bind round their hair, which

requires scanty confinement, narrow white fiUets, with two rude crocodiles of blue

cloth sewn on the band. The other two di^-isions are the wings, right and left.

--The three corps consist of five arms, under their several officers namely, 1. The

Agbarya, or blunderbuss-women, who may be considered the grenadiers. They are

the biggest and strongest of the force, and each is accompanied bv an attendant car-

rying ammunition. With these rank tlie carbineers, the bayoneteers, and a com-'

pany armed with heavy weapons, and called " Gan' u' nlan," or " Sm'e to kill." 2.
The Elephant -hunters, who are held to be the bravest of these women; twenty have

been kno^vn to bring down, at one volley, with their rude appliances, seven animals

out of a herd. 3. The Nyekplo-hen-to, or women armed with the huge razors, of

which an illustration lately appeared in the English papers. 4. The infantry, or

line women, forming the staple                                           of the forces                                                   from them, as in  France, the elite is

drawn. They are armed with Tower muskets, and are well supplied with ammu-

nition. But they " mana3u\Te with precisely the precision of a fiock of sheep," and

they are too light to stand a charge of the poorest Eiu-opean troops. Personally they

are lean, without much muscle ; they are hard dancers, indefatigable singers, and,

though aiiecting a military and swaggering gait, they are rather mild and unas-
suming in general appearance. 5. The Go-hen-to, or archeresses, who, in the late

king's tmie, were young girls, the parade coi-ps, the pride of the army, and the pink
of dancers. Armed with a peculiar bow, a quiver full of light cane-shafts, and a

small knife lashed with a lanyard to the wrist, they were distinguished by scanty

attire, by a tunic extending to the knee, and by an ivory bracelet on the left arm.

Their weapon has sunken in public esteem. Under Gezo's son they are never seen
on parade, and, when in the field, they are used as scouts and porters. They also
cany the wounded to the rear. The total niunbcr of amazons was 1685. Gelele,

the present king,has never been able to bring more than 10,000 troops into the field.

His " most illustrious %aragos " are now a mere handful. King Gezo lost the flower

of his force, in INIarch 1851, under the walls of Abeokuta, and the loss was never

made good. Gelele has lately followed the example of his sire. On Tuesday,

Mai-ch 15, 1864, the present king carried out his favomite project, his daily thought

and nightly dream--an attack upon Abeokuta, where his father had left fame and

honour. The attempt was contemptible in the extreme, and the consequence to
Dahome a loss of about 1000 slam and about 2000 captured. Thus Dahome yearly

loses prestuje. She is weakened by a traditional policy, by a continual shedding of

blood, and by the arbitrary measures of her king, who has resolved to gi-ind "the

foes of his subjects for ten years, of which six have elapsed. She is demoralized

by an export slave-trade, by frequent failings in law, and by close connexion with
Eiu-opeang. As was remarked a dozen years ago by Commander Forbes, Dahome
now contains no Dahomans. The gallant old race of which our historians speak

has  been killed                           out                its place  has  been taken                                                 by a mongrel      breed  of captives.

Except the royal blood, which may number 2000 souls, all are of an impure race,

--140 REPORT 1864.

                      On the lliver Congo. By Captain Btjeton.

    This paper contained the particulars of the author's ascent to the Yellala, or

Great Eapids of the Congo. He remarked that Africa boasted four first-rate

rivers, all rising- within the zone of nearly constant rain. These were the Nile,
the Niger, the Zambesi, and the Congo. The latter was the least-known. Navi-
gators have contented themselves hitherto with noticing its prodigious outfall
and since the fatal expedition of Captain Tuckey, travellers have not ventui-ed to

explore it. On July L^Oth, 1863, Captain Smith, of H.M. ship ' Torch,' gave Cap-

tain Bm"ton a passnge southwards from Fernando Po, where he had been suffering,

like all other white men there, with some severity. As the improvement of his
health was but slow, he resolved upon proceeding towards the highlands of the Upper

Congo, which tradition represented to be a sanatorium. After adventures and
observations, Captain Burton reached the Great Rapids. In conclusion, Captain
Burton observed that, above those rapids the grand river forks. There is a north-
eastern branch, which has been represented as flowing from a lake. The informa-
tion he obtained at the rapids left him no doubt of the tact. In the previous year,

when he visited the source of the river Gaboon, he was informed by the Fans, that
after eighteen days' travel towards the east they came upon a water flowing to the
right or southward. This must be the north-eastern fork of the Congo. He hoped
that the survey of his distinguished friend Paul du Chaillu woidd set the question
at rest. The south-eastern branch of the Congo, Captain Biu-ton firmly believes, is

the Coango and the Ca^sai which Dr. Livingstone crossed near the head.

         On the Iberian Popidation of Asia Minor anterior to the Greels.
                             By Htde Clarke, of Smyrna.

   The names of places in a country are philological and therefore ethnological
records, and it is on these that the present investigation is foimded. The most
marked result is that there is no afiinity in the ancient names of Asia Minor with
tKose of Armenia, although there is an old tradition that the Lydians were descen-
dants of the Armenians. On comparing the names in Lydia, Caria, Mysia, and
generally in Western Asia Minor with European topographical terms, afliiiities are
found with Greece, Italy, and Spain. These aiiinities are with the archaic and
new Greek element in Greece, with the archaic and new I^atin element in Italy,
and with the Iberian element in Spain. Tlie result is, as William von Humboldt
had predicted, the existence of an Iberian population in Asia Minor. Some of the
details are as follows. Arna is a local fomi which is well marked, and it is copious
in Greece and Italy. Asia, Astyra, or Astura is a recognizable Iberian form. It
signifies a rock. Thus we have Astyra in Mysia and Troas, Astura in Latium,
Astura in Spain, Asia in Liguria and Spain. It occurs also in Asia Minor, both
as a prefix and as a termination. The fonu Blmindus of Plnygia is found in the
Blanda of Lucania and Spain, and in other shapes. Bura, a termination in Asia
INlinor, is a marked Iberian tj-pe. It is perhaps herri (Basque), a town. Cora
appears to be the same as Cara. It perhaps means a peak or promontoiy ; in Basque
yora is high. Ilia, IHon, or Ilium is a remarkable form ; in Iberian it signifies a
city, town, or place. 3Iamla, Menda, or Muiida most probably signifies a hiU or
mount, for which Mendia is a word in Basque. Bcda or Bada must be a word for
a mountain, as in Iduhcdu and Orospeda, moimtains in Spain. Petarra, the French-
Basque for mountains, is found in Patara of Lycia and Cajjpadocia. Pcrr/a, or
Barija is widely distributed ; it is applied to a mountain fortress or acropolis. With
regard to words beginning with the letter E, it is worthy of remark that they are

very rare in Asia Minor, and that such words are also very rare in modem Basque.

Sardea, Basque for a fort, is found in Sardene, a mountain of IMysia, in Sardes,
which has an acropolis, and in Sardcmisstis, a mountain of Pamphylia. Tama,

Tema, or Dyma is a particle extensively applied to mountains and hill-forts. It
is a noticeable circumstance, that in Troas we find Ilimn, Pergamtis, Pedamn,

--Astyra, Scaniander, and Ida, all Iberian names. According to the author's views,

   On the Western Shores of the Dead Sea. By the Eev. G. Clowes, B.A.

   The journey was performed in 1863 in company with four friends, under the

guidance of Abu Uahuk, sheikh of the Jahalin tribe of Arabs. The party readied
the shores of the Dead Sea through the Wady-ez-Zuweirah. Whilst crossing the

broad plain which here stretches towards the lake, dead trees were observed stand-
ing in the water at some distance from the shore. Mr. Poole, in October 18o5,

r.'uiarked tlie same thing ; it is therefore more than probable that a permanent
rise in the level of the sea has taken place of late years. To the north of the
Wady-ez-Zuweirah, the party noticed tlie existence of three distinct parallel

beaches, the highest lying at least fifty feet above tlie level of the sea, wliich re-

moved all doubt that the Dead Sea was once much higher than at the present time,

and therefore the old idea of the Cities of the I'laiu being submerged is untenable.
At a place half a mile south of Ain Jid}-, the author, whilst bathing and trying
the buoyancy of the water, found that he was being carried by a strong current in

a northerly direction. He suggested that this may either have been an eddy caused

by the influx of the Jordan, or a movement produced by a spring in the bed of the
lake. The analysis of a bottle of water collected at this point countenances the
latter idea, for he had fortunately the means of comparing it with that of a portion
collected two days previously from the north of the lake :

                     Collected April 9th,          Collected

                     half mile S. of               April 7th, from

                     Ain Jiddy.                    north sliore.

Boiliug-i^oint       106°-5 Cmt.                   108° Cent.

These analyses showed that the water collected at Ain Jidy was less dense and

contained a smaller percentage of salts than that obtained two days previously at

the north. These facts appeared most interesting in connexion with the question

·whether the supply of water from the known sources is suiHcient to coimterbalance

the enormous evaporation constantly going on.

Account of an Expedition across the Roclcy Mountains into British Columbia,

   by the Yellow-Head or Leather Pass. By Viscount Milton and Dr.

    Cheadle.

   This journey was undei-taken with a view to discover the shortest route between
the Red River settlement and the gold district of Cariboo, in British Columbia.
The pass by which the party crossed the Rocky Mountains had been formerly used
by the voyageurs of the Hudson Bay Company ; but it had been long abandoned.
The route followed, after descending from this pass, namely, by the Thompson
River, had never before been attempted, owing to the dense growth of primitive
forest and the dangerous navigation of the streams. The enterprise was success-
fully accomplished by Lord Milton and his companion, though not without the loss

of nearly all their baggage and provisions and several narrow escapes of life.
Enough was seen to convince them that this was the best line for the construction

of a road from Canada, via Red River, into British Columbia, as it was the most

Adirect one practicable, and was far removed from the United States frontier.

great portion of the country to the east of the mountains was noticed to have been
completely changed in character by the agency of the beaver, which formerly

existed here in enormous numbers. The shallow valleys were formerly traversed

by_ rivers and chains of lakes, which, dammed up along their conrse at numerous

points, by the work of these animals, ha\e become a series of marshes in various

stages of consolidation. So complete has this change been, that hardly a stream
is found for a distance of 200 miles, with the exception of the large rivers. The

animals have thus destroyed, by their own labours, the waters necessary to their
existence. In the Thompson and Frazer River valleys, the travellers noticed a
series of raised terraces on a gi-and scale. They were traced for 100 miles along
--142 REPORT 1864.

the Thompson, and for about 200 miles along the Frazer River, forming three tiera
on each side of the valley, each tier being of the same height as the corresponding
one on the opposite side. The lowest terrace was of great \\adth, and presented
a perfectly level surface, raised some 30 or 40 feet above the river-bank. The second
was seldom more than 200 or 300 yai-ds wide, and stood at about 50 or 60 feet
above the J/iwer one. The third lay at a height of 400 or 500 feet above the river, on
the face of the inaccessible blviffs. They were all perfectly uniform, and free from
the roclvs and boulders which encumber the present bed of the river, being com-
posed of sand, gravel, and shale, the detritus of the ueiglibouring mountains. The
explanation of these phenomena is to be sought in the barrier of the lofty Cascade

chain of mountains, through which the Frazer has pierced a way lower down the
vallev. At a former period, the valleys of the Frazer and the Thompson seem to

have been occupied by a succession of lakes, the Cascade range then forming a bar-

rier which dammed up this great volume of water ; the highest tier of terraces
would mark the level at which it then stood. Some geological convulsion caused

a rent in the mountain barrier, allowing the waters to escape partially, so as to
form a chain of lakes at the level of the middle teiTaces ; and subsequently, after
lono- periods of repose, two other similar disturbances successively deepened the
cleft, and drained the waters first to the height of the lowest terrace, and finally to
their present level. In the course of the paper, the country east of the Kocky
INIountains was highly extolled as a promising region for settlement, especially by
an agricultural population.

  On the Sources of the Stipx>ly of Tin for the Bronze Tools and Weapons of
                       Antiqvifi/. By John Crawfued, F.R.S.

    Tin, as is well known, is found only in a very few parts of the world, and the only
localities producing it which have reference to the que>'ion under consideration
are England, the INIalayan peninsula, and Northern China. The ore is easilj- reduced,
and in early times was found in drift or alluvium. The tiii-formations of the
INIalayan countries are the most extensive in the world. These three sources
are the only principal ones fi-om which the nations of ancient Europe could have
derived this metal. Tin would be supplied in the same manner as silk and spices,

with the difference of being imported from the West as well as the East. Mer-
chants dealing in the metal would convey it as far as it fetched a profit, until
western and eastern tin met nt a central point, which may have been Eg^pt. All

the nations west of it would be supplied with British, and all those east of it with

             gypt.

 voyages of the Phoenicians to the Scilly Islands, through which they are imagined
to have supplied the Eastern world with Cornish tin. The voyage from the entrance
of the Mediterranean would be 1000 miles in a straight line over a .stonny ocean--
a vovage very unlikely to be performed by ancient mariners, who, we Imow, even

 in the Mediterranean," only crept along the coasts, hauling their craft ashore in foul
 weather. Besides, the Scilly Islands, the supposed Cassitci-ides, aftbrd no evi-
 dence of having ever produced tin. There is, in fact, no evidence that either the
 Greeks or the Phoenicians ever passed the Straits of Gibraltar.

           On the Supposed Infecundity of Human Hyhrids or Crosses.
                               By John Crawfurd, F.R.S.

    The object of this paper is the refutation of a theory which has lately obtained
Countenance in France and America, the purport of which is that the cross offspring
 of different races of man is essentially sterile, and must without intermixture of the

 pure blood of one or other of the parents, in due time die out. In refutation of
 this extravagant hj-pothesis, the author refers to the dense populations of France
 and England, the most mixed nations of Europe, and the millions of ^lulattos and

IVIestizos which have come into existence since the discovery of the New World.

 Even where the two races were perfectly equal, he shows that no sterility was the
 result, and for this pm-pose quotes the case of the mutineers of the 'Bounty,' in

          On the Em-ly Migration of Man. Btj John Crawfijrd, F.R.S.
   The object of the writer of this paper is to show that the migTations of man in
his early and rude state were impossible, from his own weakness or want of means,

and the obstacles of physical geography opposed to his progress and he quotes in
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

                              By John Ceawfttkd, F.li.S.

   The object of the writer is to show, contrary to the general belief of archae-
ologists, that in most cases iron was used before bronze, or that an iron age in
general preceded a bronze one. With this view, he quotes a number of examples,

chieflj' di-awu from the practice of Oriental nations.

On the Tostedal Brae, a large Glacier-system in Southern Norway.

                        By Charles M. Dofghtt.

This glacier-system lies between the sixtj'-first and sixty-second parallels of

north latitude. The height of the snow-line in this region is undetermined;

but it probably varies from 4000 to 5400 feet. Observations were made upon four

of the greater glacial outlets which descend into the valley Yostedal and its

branches, and the approximate daily motion of a ti-ansverse line determined by

help of a theodolite lent by the RWal Geographical Society. The phenomena

commonly described as characteristic of glaciers by ^^i-iters on the Swiss Alps were

observed upon one or other or all of these. They vary in length from about seven

to about ten English miles, and in breadth from about lialf a mile to one mile. Three

of them are much rifted, and are inclined, near thek lower extremities, at an angle

of from 12° to 16°. Of these the daily motions of the centre were found to lie

between twelve and fifteen inches. In the fourth case, the lower part of the ice-

stream being remarkably consolidated, with a slope of 7° when measm'ed, and

nearly free from crevasses, the diumal motion at (near) the centre was four inches.

These glacial outlets have all considerably diminished in modern times, and are still

diminishing. They descend to within from 1000 feet to 1700 feet of the sea-level.

Tlieir names are Nigaardsbrae, Faabergstolsbrae, Lodalsbrao, and Trangidalsbrae.

They are noticed in Professor James P'orbes's work, 'Norway and its Glaciers.'

Bohr, a Noi-wegian gentleman, published many years ago an "account of a short

visit to this neighboui-hood, and more lately M.i)m-ocher has described and compared

Athem with the glaciers of the Alps.  work upon the " Folge Fond," another

of South Noi-way's glacial systems, is about to be published by the Univer-

sity of Christiania. The motions of glacial outlets in general appear to depend,

next to climate, upon their thicknesses. The writer believes the character and

constitution of the great icy expansions, one of which is noticed here, to be the

subject most deserving of attention' in the glacial systems of southern Norway. He

believes that they accurately resemble, on the small scale, the glacial coverings of

Greenland and the Polar lands.

         On the Fixity of the Types of Man. By the Eev. T. Farkae.

   As far as we can go back, the races of man, under all zones, appear to have
maintained an unalterable fixity. On the oldest Egyptian monuments we find Jews,

Arabs, Negi'oes, Egyptians, Assyrians, and Europeans depicted with a fidelity as to
colour and featm-e hardly to be sm-passed by a modern artist. It might be objected
that this fiixity was due to the surroimding conditions having remained unaltered.
--144 REPORT 1864.

But a glance at the map shows this objection to be invalid ; for the eastern region

of Asia, from 70° N. lat. to the equator, oilers every variety of temperatui-e, yet is

peopled by a single t^'pe, the Mongolian. By tlie side of the fair Circassian we

find brown Calmucks : short, dark Lapps live side by side with tall, fair Finns.
The colour of the American Indian depends very little on geographical position.

In short, colour is distributed over the globe in patches, not in zones. Europeans

transplanted from the temperate to the torrid zone do not, even in the course of

generations, undergo any considerable moditication of type. This may be seen in

the Dutch, who have lived in Soutli Africa for 300 years, and in the descendants of

the Spaniards and Portuguese in South America ; also in the negroes transplanted

to America. Independently of this, we hnd races widely differing from each other,
but dwelling side by side, who, so far as we know, have, from time immemorial,

been affected by the" same climate: such is the case with the Bosjesmen and the
Kaffirs, the Fuegians and the Patagoniaus, the Parsees and the llindoos. This
fixity of ivoe; applies to habits as well as to corporeal features. The life of the

Ishmaelite' of to-day might be described in the identical terms applied to his first
ancestor ; and the Mongol has the same habits as in the days of ^Eschylus and

Herodotus, or, perhaps, tliousauds of years before. It may be objected that a period

of a few centuries is little or nothing in ethnological matters. It is, at any rate,
everything to those who, without miraculous interference, of which nothing is re-
corded, have not more than that period between the Deluge and the date of the

oldest E'^j^ptian monument in which to account for the appearance of, for instance,
the full-grown, well-marked Nigritian type. It remains for e\ ery one who is con-
vinced of these facts to draw from them such inferences as appear to him most

truthful and logical.

On the Poisoned Arrows of Savage Man.

     Bij Professor H.vrley, M.D., F.Ii.S., Universlti) College, London.

A large collection of the missile weapons of savage man shows various gi-ada-

tions in the inventive facultj' of races. First, there is the simple pointed stick,

fixed in the end of the reed shaft of the arrow, as seen in the weapons of the

Solomon Islanders. Experience having taught savages the inefficiency of this kind

of arrow, we next see notches cut in the stick ; and this is again improved on by
Atixino- iron barbs in the arrow-head to retain it in the wound.
                                                                  great improve-

ment" on all these is found in the arrows of the nations of Eastern Africa, which

have an iron head to the shaft, as well as barbs below it. The next great step in

advance is the invention of a poison wherewith to anointthe point of the missile,

so as to insure speedy death to the wounded animal. Poisoned arrows are found

amongst the natives of the Malay archipelago. Northern India, Africa, and South

America; but many weapons sent, by travellers and others, to the author as

poisoned have tm'ned out, on examination, not to be so, but to have been merely

smeared with paint for ornament or conservation. The desideratum in an effective

poisoned missile is so to contrive it as to enable it to remain in the wound suffi-

ciently long to make the action of the poison certain. An iron or even a smooth

wooden point or blade does not answer this end. The savages of the banks of the

Zambesi, in Africa, therefore show considerable ingenuity in winding a cotton

thread round the arrow-head, and smearing this with the tatal juice. But the

Indians of the northern parts of South Ameiica have gone beyond this, and have

invented the most ingenious weapon yet known amongst uncivilized nations. It is

a reed with a sharp point fixed in a hole at the end. The arrow-head pierces the

--animal; the concussion shakes oft' the shaft. An Indian on going to the chase takes

a quiver full of t'.iese points they are, in fact, his shot ; the point alone remains

in the wound of the animal he shoots, and its death is thereby rendered almost

certain. Moreover, if by some mischance his booty escapes him, the Indian does

not lose the arrow, which takes him some time to manufacture, and of which he

can only carry with him a limited supply. The author has carefully analyzed and

experimented on all the arrow-poisons which he had been able to obtain, and the

residt was that there were only two distinct kinds of the physiological action of the

poison used by savage races ; one is t>-pified by the Woorara of the northern parts

of South America, and the other by the poison of Borneo, known in the latter

country as the Antiar. The action of these two groups of poisons is diametrically

opposite. The Woorara affects the muscular system, destroying its action before it

attects the heart ; whilst the Borneo poison paralyzes the heart fii-st, leaving the
muscular system active for some short time alter. The author then discussed the

subject of the existence of nearly identical weapons (such as the blow-gim, through

--which short poisoned arrows are propelled by the breath) amongst tribes of savages

widely separated from each other the natives of Borneo, the tribes of the Hima-

layan mountains, and the Indians of the northern parts of South America. He said

--there were three modes of accounting for this coincidence : 1. They may have been

invented by primitive men before the various races became segregated ; 2, the dis-
tant tribes may have communicated with each other since tlieir separation ; 3, or
the invention may have been independent, analogous conditions having given rise
to the same ideas. The balance of probability, he thought, inclined towards the

second of these explanations.

        On Russian Trade vjith Bohhara. By M. Alexander Himxis.

   The trade between Russia and the Central Asiatic nations is not large, and con-
sists chiefly of cattle exchanged by the Russians with the Kirgeeses for com.
There is certainly no matter for English jealousy. Everybody who contributes to

avoid such jealousies further contributes to effect the working hand-iu-hand of the
English and Russians, and deserves great merit in advancing geographical know-
ledge and calming the ferocious barbarism in Khiva, Bokhara, Kokan, &c. Their
influence on the sea-like Kirgees-steppes is quite as baneful as the piratical states

were formerly to the Mediterranean Sea. Sir Hemy Rawlinson said that M.

Vamb^ry might fairly claim the honour of having been the first European who
Lad visited and described Samarkand for 450 yeai-s. The author claimed that
honour for his countrjmien, the Russians. The Khan of Bokhara, being desirous

to explore certain parts of his kingdom in search of gold, asked the Russian Govern-
ment to send him some ofiicers of mines for that purpose, in consequence of which

a party were sent. MM. Butteneft' and Bogoslowski have published, in the Rus-

sian oflicial ' Mining Journal ' of 1842, Nos. 10 and 11, several articles concerning

the mineralogical riches, mining, money, &c., in Bokhai-a, and the meteorological
observations made during their journey.

On the Ethnology of the Iranian Race. By M. Nicolas de Khanikof.

 Starting with the Aryan theory of  the original identity of the  Hindus and  Ira-

_

nians or Persians, the -writer proceeded to answer the question, Where was the

cradle of the Iranian family ? by an investigation into some of their most ancient

traditions, beginning with an analysis of the Vendidad and the poems of Firdusi.

The conclusion was that they were probably originally scattered to the north, west,

south, and east of the fertile valleys situated between the Hindoo Koosh, the Cor-

dilleras of Poughman and Koohi Baba, and of the well-watered plains of Herat,

Seistan, and Kirman. The results of a careful examination of craniological types

amongst the nations of these parts of Asia partly confirmed this conclusion. The

Persian blood, however, has been much improved by crossing, dming more than

2000 years, with various populations, but especially with Semites and Turanians.

Huns, and maintain to this day the habits of the ancient Scythians. Utilizing the
few resources at their command, and their wants being few and simple, they are
nearly independent of the entire world. Their government is despotic and patri-

archal. They pay tribute to their chiefs, who are all subject to the Emperor of

China; but, practically, the Mongols enjoy every liberty. M. Michie described

Siberia at some length, and, speaking of its inhabitants, says the Slavonic popula-
tion are the descendants of exiles, but not necessarily convicts. In the days of
serfdom in Russia a proprietor had the privilege of sending a serf into exile without
assigning a higher reason than his own will. Hence many persons of good character
have been exiled from sheer caprice on the part of their masters. It was also
remarked that many exiles rise to eminence.

This was an extract from a recent letter of Mr. Petherick, dated Khartum, May

A23rd, 1864.                    number of men belonging to Kurschid Aga, a trader of the Upper

Nile, had retm-ned to Khartum from Goudokoro, and had informed Mr. Petlierick

that they had accompanied Mr. Baker as far as Kamrasi's palace, near Lake Vic-

toria Nyanza, where they had fonned a trading depot, and had left some of their

party in charge thereof. Mr. Baker had been well received by the chief Kamrasi,

who having supplied him with an escort, had left that place to explore a lake to the
westward. The men informed me that, anxious to return to their boats for the
pui-pose of supplying the new station with sufficient requirements for the prosecution

of trade during the rainy season, they did not wait for Mr. Baker, therefore as they
left no boats at Gondokoro, that gentleman will have no chance of returning by the
Nile until the termination of the next year's trading campaign, which terminates

at that place in the months of May or June 1865. In answer to strict inquiries,

Mr. Baker was stated to have been in good health, but to have lost his cattle.

On the Ethnic Relations of the- Eijuptian Race. By Eeg. Sittaet Poole.

The author commenced by stating that his object was to inquire what light the

ancient Egyptian monuments threw upon the smgle or more than single origin of

the Egj'ptian race, and thus to call in the aid of archreology in the examination of

one of the most interesting problems of ethnology. He brought forward no evi-

--dence as to which the general body of Egyptologists were not agjeed.
   Race. The simplest division into which the races of man could be reduced was

black, white, and intermediate. Of the black race, one of the varieties of the lowest

type was the African negro of the white race, one of the varieties of the highest
                                                                                                                                  ;

type the Shemite Arab. These varieties the author selected because the Egyptian

monuments show us that, for the last 3000 years, they ha^e been the two most

typical neighbours of the Egyptians. The ancient Egyptians constituted a variety

of what has been called the Ethiopian race, but might be better called the Lower

Nilotic. The modern Egyptians constitute a somewhat different variety. The

ancient Egyptians, as known to us from monuments ranging from 4000 to 2G00

years ago, were acknowledged by all etlinologists to hold an intermediate place

between the Negroes and the Arabs. The physical characteristics of tlie Egyptians

were then minutely described, their intemiediate place shown, and the difference of

the modem from the ancient Egyptians, in the further departure from the Negro

and approach to the Arab, proved. The cause of this difterence was well known

to be the great influx of Arabs into Egypt, especially since the Muslim conquest.

But, notwithstanding this change, which was less than we shoidd expect, the Negro

type still asserted itself in the Egyptians, and a period of 4000 years gave us no

parallax. In race they seemed to present the traits of a double ancestry.

  --Relff/ion.--The heathen religions might be thus classified : High nature-wor-

the same origin; Nigritian, low nature-worship; Tatar, magic. The ancient

Egyptian religion had never been explained as a system. It was self-contradictory,

Aas in the case of animal-worship, for which no reason could be assigned.                                                                                                                     critical

examination would show that the Egyptian religion consisted of two elements, high

and low nature-worship Shemite and Nigritian, which was further proved by the

--actual Shemite or Nigritian characteristics of these two portions.
   -^rt. Art was often connected with race. But. as pure Shemites and Negroes

had no art, the Egyptians could not have been of either stock alone. The gradual

increase in size and importance of the monuments and engineering works in the

earliest period might be explained by the existence of a serf-race of Nigi-itians

--gradually destroyed or absorbed by the Shemites.
   Lam/uar/e. Languages might be classed, according to seeming development, as

monosyllabic, agglutinate, and amalgamate ; according to relations, as the Semitic

family, the Iranian family, and the so-called Turanian family. The last is not

proved to be a ftimily, and its different groups are connected bv similaiities that do

not establish cognation. The author proposed the term " BarWrie " for this class,

not family. The monosyllabic and agglutinate languages are barbaric ; the amal-

gamate, Semitic and Iranian. The Egyptian language had a barbaric monosyllabic

vocabulary and an amalgamate Semitic grammar. This, it was maintained^ could

only be explained on the supposition of a double origin of the Egyptians. These

opinions were stated in the 'Genesis of the Earth and of Man,' aiitf were adopted

by the autlior of this paper as affording a solution of the great difficulties of his

special study of Egj-ptology.

On the Meenas, a Wild Tribe of Central India.

       By Lieut.-Col, Showers, F.R.6.S.

The_ ethnological description of the tribe was prefaced by some observations on

aborigines generally, and introducing the different modes in which contact with the

dominant race had been found to modify their character and condition ; and taking

it as a test of the character of the rule of the dominant races respectively, the

author referred to several examples of the successful reclaiming of wild tribes in

India by the enrolment of them into military and police corps, as affording a vantage

ground of comparison, in favour of the government of the late rulers of India,

against that of any other government. The detailed account of the particular tribe

described represents a remarkable race, which, ha\-ing retreated centuries ago to a

strong hilly tract at the quadruple boundary of four independent native states, had

niaintained itself in a state of lawless independence, by taking advantage of the

jealousies of the different states concerned, and subsisting by plimdering as a pro-

fession. Emboldened at length by long impunity, the tribe seems to have had the

audacity to make a series of inroads into the neighbouring British district, attack-

ing even walled towns, and carrying off the plunder and some of the inhabitants

to their fastnesses. These outrages are stated as the cause of our author having to

take the Meenas in hand                                                                                                                    and -in referring to the present  tranquillity of  that once

to the deplorable contests with savage tribes going on at the present day in other

parts of the world. An armed demonstration sufficed to introduce the administra-

tive measui-es which have been attended with such happy results.

On the Physical Geography of the Peruvian Coast Valleys of Chira and Pitva,

   This was a description of the soil and climate of those distiicts of northern Peru
in which the different Peru\dan varieties of the species of cotton-tree, named Gos-
sypinm barhadense, are so successfully cultivated. The memoir will be published by
the Indian Government for distribution amongst the planters in India, where these
varieties of the cotton-plant were introduced by Mr. Clements Markham. The
districts described are remarkable for the absence of rain, the only humid and fer-
tile districts being the valleys of the numerous short streams which flow from the
Andes to the Pacific. Seasons of heavy rain, nevertheless, occurred at long inter-
vals, in some cases of seventeen years.

                     On the River Purus. By Eichard Spruce.

   This river communicates with the Amazon by one principal mouth, and at four

narrow channels (called furos). When the author was at the Barra do Rio Negro,

in 1851, a man of colour, named Serafim Salgado, an-ived there from the Purus,

where he had spent some six months trading with the Purupurii (or Spotted)

Indians, who inhabit the lower part of the river, and fi-om whom it takes its name

and also with the Catauixis, whose settlements extend upwards to a distance of
two months' journey from the mouth. This Serafim Salgado was afterwards
officially commissioned to explore the river. It is clear, from Serafim's report,
that the plain through which the Puriis flows has a scarcely perceptible declivity,
for he nowhere encountered cataracts or even rapids. Indeed, the head of navi-
gation of the Purus must needs be on a lower level than that of the Beni and
Maniort5 ; and yet on a tributary of the latter (the Chapare) Gibbon found that
water boiled at 209° 5', indicating an elevation above the sea of only 465 feet.

This goes far to show that Humboldt may be correct in his supposition of a strip
of low land extending from the Amazon valley, between the Andes on the one

hand and the mountains of BrazU on the other, all through the provinces of Mojos
and Chiquitos, to the basin of the River Plate. The Pm-iis will at some future
day become one of the gi-eat highways between the Andes and the Amazon.

   The author communicated the chief results of his recent natural-history explo-
ration of Palestine. No signs of volcanic eruption were found in the neighbour-
hood of the Dead Sea and the Jordan Valley, and the statements of De Saulcy on
these points were shown to be wholly en-oneous. The depression of the Dead Sea
was coincident with the synclinal line of the great system of inclined limestone
strata of the region. The district of Moab was spoken of in most laudatory terms,

as regards its climate and fertility ; indeed, the southern portion of the Jordan
valley formed a tract of comitry entirely different as to its A'egetation and animal

life from the rest of Palestine. Its fauna and flora yielded many new species, and
showed Indian and African types ; the total results could not, however, at preseiit
be given, as the flora was still being worked out by Mr. Lowne, the botanist to the

Expedition.

On the Progress of Civilization in Northern Celebes,

         By Alfred E. Wallace, F.B. 6.S.

The northern peninsula of Celebes is the only part of that island which is of vol-
Acanic structure.
                   considerable portion of it is elevated 2500 feet above the sea,

forming the beautiful plateau of Tondano, in the centre of which is a lake about

twenty miles in circumference. Scattered about this plateau are volcanic peaks

Aand ridges 6000 or 7000 feet high.  fertile soil clothes even the mountain slopes

of all this region, and, assisted by the abimdant equatorial rains and a mild and

uniform temperature, supports a vegetation of great liLxuriance and beauty. The

Dutch have now had possession of this country for nearly 200 year.?, having taken

it from the Portuguese in 1677. The inhabitants, more particularly on the centre

plateau, differ from those of the rest of the Celebes. They often approach to the

fair complexion of the Em-opean, while they retain the straight black hair and

general physiognomy of the Malay races. In character they are gentle and sub-

missive, industi'ious and easily educated. Up to a very recent period they were

cornplete savages, and were almost always at war with each other. They built

their huts upon lofty posts to guard against attacks, and decorated them with the

heads of their slain enemies. Their clothing was strips of bark, and their r.eligion
was a degrading demon-worship. From this state of barbarism they have been

raised to comparative ci-vilization in a short time by the Dutch Government. The
country is now becoming a garden worthy of its sweet native name, "Minahassa."

The villages are almost all like model villages, and the cottages like those one sees

upon the stage. The streets are bordered with trimmed turf, and fenced with

hedges of roses in perpetual bloom. Near every village are the most beautifully

cultivated and productive coffee-plantations, while rice-fields and fruit and vege-

table grounds supply abundance of food to the inhabitants. In every village there

is a school-house, and in the larger ones a church also. The people are all neatly

dressed, and^ the native chiefs and schoolmasters would pass muster among respect-

able people in England. On arriving at one of these chiefs' bouses, in a principal

village, the writer was received by a gentleman in a suit of black ; boys nicely
dressed and with smooth-combed hair brought water and napkins for him" to wash,
and he was furnished with a dinner comprising every European comfort, finger-

gl.vses, clean napkins, claret, and beer, along with a variety of well-cooked native
dishes. The house was handsome and lofty ; the chairs and tables were of fine na-

tive woods, and, though made by self-taught natives, were of superior workmanship

to any but the very best we get at home ; and as he sat in the verandah taking

coffee his eye was gratified by the sight of beautiful flowers, which, in this delight-

fid climate, are perpetually renewed. This great change is the result of the intro-

duction of the coffee-platit under Government superintendence, and of the labours
of Dutch Protestant missionaries. The native chiefs were induced to further the
views of the Government by the promise of a per-centage on the colFee-produce of

their district, and the whole system is carried out by them, under the advice and

support of the inspectors and Dutch residents. Each family in a village works in

the plantations; an account is kept of the number of days' "labour eacli gives, and
when the produce is sent to the government warehouses^ and paid for at the fixed

price agreed upon on the formation of the plantations, the amount is divided pro-

portionately among the inhabitants. The chief and the other head men of the vil-
lage decide upon how many days a week it is necessary to work at different times

of the year, and the \-iIlagers aire called to labour at ti"xed hours by beat of gong.

This community of labour is a common feature among people in th"e first stages of

civilization, and rarely is any other pressure than public opinion required to insure

regularity. Habits of industry have thus been fostered, and a considerable sum of
money is realized annually by each family. Under the advice and example of the

missionaries and government inspectors, the people build neat houses and adopt
European clothing and habits. Their children go to school ; the Malay language

spreads rapidly, and is superseding the numerous native dialects ; and general morality

has undergone a vast improvement. No one who sees these people, and inquires

as to their foraier condition, can avoid the conclusion that they are both morally

and physically far superior to what they were. But it is said this change has bee n
brought about by "monopoly" and "despotism," and therefore cannot be right.
150 REPORT 1864.

The author believed, however, that the relation of a civilized to an vmcivilized race

over whom it rules is exactly analogous to that of parent to child, or of adidts to

infants, and that a certain aniount of despotic rvde and gaiidance is as essential in
the one case as it is in the other. The only question is as to the manner in which
the " paternal despotism" shall he can-ied out ; and he thinks that the system of

upholding and regulating the power of the native chiefs, whom the people are

already accustomed to obey, of introducing systematic cultivation under govern-
ment superintendence, and favouring the exertions of missionaries and native teach-
ers, is a far better plan than throwing open a country to the competition of a low
class of European traders and cultivators, which inevitably leads to the degradation
of the natives, and a conflict of interests, inducing mutual animosity between the
two races. The system of the Dutch, as carried out here and in Java, he considers
as most excellent, and especially valuable as a step in the education of an unci^-ilized
race ; and he cannot but contrast it with the deplorable results of the free compe-

tition of antagonistic races in New Zealand, which can only end in the extermina-

tion of a people which it seems probable would, under more favourable conditions,
have been capable of improvement and civilization.

On the Increasing Desiccation of Inner Southern Africa.

                   By James Fox Wilson.

  A very noticeable fact has of late years attracted the attention of residents in

--South Africa namely, the gradual drying up of large tracts of country in the

Trans-Gariep region. " The Calabari Desert is gaining in extent, gradually swallow-

ing up large portions of habitable country on its borders. Springs of water have

diminished in their flow, and pools, such as that at Serotli, described by Livingstone,

Aare now either dry or rapidly becoming so.      long list of springs and pools now

gradually drying up was given by the author of tlie paper. The great change,

however, had commenced, if we may trust native traditions, long before the advent

of Europeans, which are corroborated by tlie existence of an immense number of

stumps and roots of acafi?e iu tracts where now not a single living tree is to be

seen. In seeking to account for this, it was necessary to dismiss from the mind all

idea of cosniical changes or earthquakes, of which no trace is visible in Southern

Africa. The causes lie in the physical characteristics of the counti-y and in the

customs of the inhabitants. The region drained by the Orange river is naturally

arid, from the interposition of the Quathlamba mountains between it and the

Indian Ocean, whence the chief rain-clouds are derived. The prevailing -nands

are from the north-east. The clouds, heavily laden with vapour from the Indian

Ocean, are driven over Catt'raria, watering those lands luxuriantly; but when the

moisture-bearing nimbi arrive at the summits of the moimtain range which divides

Caffi-aria from the interior country, they are not only deprived already of part of
their moisture, but they meet with the rarefied air of the central plains, and con-
sequently rise higher and evaporate into thinner vapour. There are few spots,
however, which are wholly destitute of vegetation, and large trees are frequent.

There is no district which  does  not  maintain  its  flocks  of  wild animals                                                               but the
                                                                                                                                          ;

diminution of even one or two inches of rain in the year is most severely felt. The

author came to the conclusion, after a carefid inquiry into the geological foi-mations
of the region and the som-ces of springs, that much water must lie, throughout

wide tracts, deep below the surface of the soil, and that the boringof artesian wells
would jield a permanent supply for in-igation. But as a remedy for the gTOwing

evil, he laid particidar stress on legislative enactments to check the reckless felling
of timber and burning of pastures, which has been .long practised both by the

natives and the European colonists.

ECONOMIC SCIENCE AND STATISTICS.

Address by Wii-liam Fakk, M.D., D.C.L., F.R.S., the President of the Section.

--Gentlemex, I am deeply sensible of the honour which has been conferred upon

me by placing me in this Chair.

   In opening your proceedings, I propose to bring rapidly under your notice the

state of the science which you have met in this Section to promote as Members of

the British Association.

   Mathematics is the great abstract science -which fosters all the rest ; and physics,
mechanics, chemistry, mineralogy, geology, geography, ethnology, embrace the
phenomena of the heavens, the earth, and the thi'ee kingdoms of nature. They
occupy other Sections.

   Man himself is the special study of physiology and of ethnology in two of those

Sections; but there they inquire into the functions and parts of the body, or the
condition of cm' race as the foremost of the animal kingdom ; while geography
describes nations, as it describes mountains and rivers, because they are on the

earth's siu'face.

"\Ye have to do with men in States, and in political communities. Statistics is

essentially a science of the relation-? of numbers of men, and its laws are founded

on the observation of mankind as they exist in nations now and in past times

but, building on facts that can be measured and expressed in numbers, it is only in

civilized communities, and in recent times, that it hnds adequate materials. Tlie

domain of the past we almost abandon to the geologists or the historians : and we

leave the uncivilized world in the possession' of our enterprising neighbours the

ethnologists ; while we yet hope one day to enter this held, and indeed have

already made, under established Governments, some conquests among the races in

India, in Ivussia, and in South America.

Mau in society possesses property, and all his possessions fall within our pro-

Wevince, for they form an intrinsic part of the State.                                              have to study, besides the

political relations of men to each other, their riches in land, in horses, sheep, and

the cattle on a thousand hills, in grain and crops, ia precious metals, in minerals,

and in merchandise.

Here are found the gToimds of two grand divisions of statistics ; the first falling

imder the head of Populatiim, and the second under the head of Property, which is

the subject also of econondc science.

Under Population are discussed the races, sexes, ages, marriages, births, deaths,

causes of death, the ranks, professions and tenm-es of each people in a State : from

their earnings the value of their life-work is deduced ; certain acts are also inves-
tigated, such as baptisms, attendances at schools or at chm-ches, votes at elec-

tions, crimes, pimishments, diseases, and civil actions. Civil and military statistics

constitute a capital chapter of this division.

The statistics of Property are di\-isible into two chapters : the first treats of

the fixed property, including land, miues, forests, manufactories, houses, roads,

canals, and rivers                                                                                  its basis is a map on a scale large enough to  exhibit  the  quan-
                                                                                                 ;

tities of every parcel of land and the area of every dwelling-house : the holdings

of land, its burthens, and transfers, naturally fall under this head.

Under the second head falls the moveable property, including live stock, ships,

machines, goods, merchandise, and vendible products of all kinds.

Jhe annual produce of the two classes of property, its transport, its sales, its

prices, and its relation to the stock, form the subject of the three sections of agri-

cultural statistics, industrial statistics, and commercial statistics.
   The public revenue and expenditure, the financial operations of the public ex-

chequer, of the banks, and of the gTeat companies, offer an extensive field, and are
in the domain of financial statistics.

There are other minor divisions, but the object I aim at is to survey rapidly the

field of our labours, which, although it is concerned in the facts of public interest
to statesmen and political inquirers, and includes the fundamental part of politics,

yet does not embrace all the doctrines of that kindred science, which, I may

add, has been kuuinously expounded by Sir George Lewis in the treatise on the
                                                                            --

--' Methods of Observation and Reasoning in Politics ;' his greatest work and to
--politics what Whewell's book is to the phj^sical sciences replete with the latest

results of European learning, and a solid, hitherto unsurpassed, contribution to

political science.

Sir George Lewis was a Fellow of the Statistical Society, and himself a labourer

Hein early life in the field of practical statistics.                                 was well versed, too, in its

philosophy, yet his genius did not lie in the direction of the physical sciences or of

the mathematics, which are' the soul of statistics ; but, standing on the border
land, and on an eminence survej'ing all the ten-itories, his calm judgment is impar-
tial and commands attention. Noticing the imperfections in the early records of

facts and numbers. Sir George Lewis obsen-es,
   " The importance of accurate statistical information as the basis of historical

description, as well as of political reasoning, both speculative and practical, cannot

be too much insisted on. The attention of modern Governments has been dii'ected

to the subject, and it has been understood that a constant registration of social and
political facts ought to be kept up, without any immediate practical object; like
the obsenations of the heavenly bodies, temperature, weather, tides, and other
natural phenomena, made by the physical philosopher. Facts, unimportant in

themselves, become important as units                              comprised in a complete        enumeration                                                   and
                                                                                                                                                             ;

results are thus obtained, to which mere conjecture, or the loose and vague impres-

sions derived from a partial observation, could not have led. This process is now

carried on, with more or less completeness, by all civilized Governments, and the

collection of statistical information, not merely for practical but for scientific pur-

poses, is recognized as a legitimate object of public policy. There are now statis-

tical departments in all the principal states of Europe"*.

   Here is another element of classification, for the materials of science exist in each
State, so in our archives are the statistics of England, Sweden, France, Spain, Italy,

Germany, Russia, the United States of America, and some other coimtries, at least

in outline. M. Quetelet, one of the foimders of this Section of the British Asso-

ciation, is now engaged on a work, of which proofs are on the table, exhibiting the
comparative statistics of the population of Europe, on a plan nearly uniform. He

submits it to your inspection, and had a gi'eat desire to be present, but is kept

away by circumstances over which he has no control. I feel sure that I have your
authority to reciprocate the good wishes of this veteran of science. The work
had its origin at the International Statistical Congi-ess, which was convened in
1860 by Her Majesty's Government, in London, and was presided over by the late
Prince Consort ; whose sagacity, we may believe, did not fail him when he pro-
claimed that the statists of his day were laying " the foundation of an edifice,

necessarily slow of consti-uction, and requiring, for generations to come, laborious

and persevering exertion, intended as it is for the promotion of human happiness,
by leading to the discovery of those eternal laws upon which that universal happi-
ness is dependent." These last words of the good Prince may well cheer lis on

the way.

You will see at once that the observation of the scientific facts with which we

are concerned in so many States of the world, has already supplied the materials

for sure induction, and placed statistics among those applied sciences which reveal

laws, and arm man with power over man and over nature.

In proportion as Governments are organized and intelligent, they cultivate sta-

tistics                              and  it  is  gi-atifying  to  obsen-e  that nearly all  the  States of Europe sent
                                  ;

official delegates to the Statistical CongTess which met last year at Berlin, under

the auspices of the Government of Prussia, and under the able presidency of Dr.

Engel.
   Spain, which had fallen in aiTear, had been put upon her mettle, and in 1857,

and again in 1801, took a census, of Avhich many interesting results have just been
published: the population was 15,6.58,.531, some millions more than she formerly
liad credit for, and entitling her, when her finances are upon a sound footing, again
to a place among the Powers of Europe.

   The Kingdom of Italy was no sooner constituted than its statistics were deve-

                                                                   * Vol. i. p, 137.

Aloped.  censiia was taken, and we find a population of 22 millions (21,893,171)*

in this constitutional State. Ovei'I Rome, Venice, Lombardy, Mantua, Trieste, the

Tyrol, Ticino, Savoy, Corsica, Malta, and the Kingdom of Italy, a population of

27 millions speaking Italian is difhised. The births, deaths, and marriages are regis-

tered, and the piincipal statistical elements are imder observation and inquiry in

the Kingdom of Italy, which wiU henceforward have a voice of weight in the

aft'airs of Eiu-ope, and in science. The statistics of Itaty are ably displayed in the

Statistical Annuary, for 1864, of Correnti and Maestri, who have had a large share

in the organization of the statistics of the new kingdom.

Russia, until lately, did little for statistical science ; and the Emperor Nicholas

refused to send a Russian to the first Congi-ess in Brussels, on the alleged ground

that his empire had nothing to learn from the science of Europe. Things have

since greatly changed, and the Russian Government now fuUy recognizes the

claims not only of her own people, but of science and of Europe, to a faithful

account of the population and resources of that empire. M. von Buschen and

Mr. Wilson were sent over by the Imperial CTOvernmeut to observe our proceedings

in the last census ; and M. Troinski, who was here recently, informed me that

measures were under consideration for taking as accurate a census of Russia as

circumstances will allow. The births, deaths, and marriages will also be registered

Wemore .accurately.     may thus expect a gi'eat accession of information from

Russian statists, respecting an empire emancipating millions of serfs, and passing

through changes which the older States of Europe traveised in what maybe called

pre-statistic times. Popular books contain many statements of numbers which

are put forth as statistics, but are purely conjectural, or are based upon loose esti-

mates. Among the latter numbers is the alleged population of Russia, which i. s

set down in the Gotha Almanack at 74,139,-394 souls, neither more nor less

exclusive of the population of Russian America, which belonged to a company

Howwhose privileges expu'ed at tlie end of 1863.  far this is wi'ong it is difficult

to say; there have been partial censuses, but the population of the empire has

never been enumerated.

So it is in our Indian Empire, the population of which is cited as 135,571,351,

The populations of the North-West Provinces, and of the Madras Presidency, have

been counted, but the other numbers are " guesses," for we have not everywhere
adopted the " practice of counting." The population is as likely to be several

millions more in India as to be millions less, for the maxim of Dr. Johnson is not

invariably true, that " when numbers are guessed they are always magnified." It
is said that the population of Rome was once estimated by the weight of cobwebs

nathin its precincts; and that Xerxes ascertained the numbers of his host by

measuring the ground upon which they stood. How the guesses are made in India

we do not precisely know, but it is probable that the population of many of the

provinces has been estimated from their area. The enlightened and really benefi-

cent Government of India, which collects £43,000,000 of revenue from the popu-

lation annually, will no doubt ere long contrive to perfoi-m the really arduous task,

at least once for that part of Southern Asia, which Russia is about to perfomi in

the North for the barbarous tribes of Siberia, and thus extend the boundaries of

official knowledge, enumerate Her Majesty's subjects, and make India by its census

an integral part of the empire.

The British Colonies deserve great praise for their statistics. The last census of

Canada is elaborate ; and Mr. Archer, Mr. Rolleston, and their colleagues in

Australia, have placed the statistics of those colonies upon such a footing that we

shall be able to trace with exti-aordinary minuteness the development of the empire

in the southern hemisphere.

Of China several State censuses are cited, but I confess that I have less faith in

the official returns of 367,632,907 " mouths "t (the Chinese for sotds) in China

proper, than I have in those of India ; in fact, we should be glad to hand the num-

bera over to the geographers, recommending them, when they give the populations

of countries, even in their elementary books, to cite the figures with discrimination.

A due appreciation of the value of published facts is an element in all the sciences.

Statistics is prosecuted  to some extent  in  every State                                                        and  in  countries where
                                                                                                              ;

observation is difficult, intelligence scarce, and facts fugitive, figures appear to

be so essential that they are invented. I should regret to apply this remark to the

census of the Sandwich Islands, which iu 18(31 had a population of (37,084 nati^'es

and 2716 foreigners, and is declining, accoiding to the census of King Kameha-

meha IV. and of his Anglo-Saxon Queen Emma, nee Miss Rooker. Indeed I would

rather adduce the insular census to prove that statistics are journeying round the

world, and that the statistics of small States are often interesting, and illustrate

general laws,

   It is evident that the statistics of Bath, for instance, which has 52,528 inhabi-
tants, are at least as instructive as the statistics of Hesse Homburgh, Avhich has
a population of only 20,817; while those of the 444,873 people of Somerset, the
county in which we meet, are not a whit less interesting than those of anj' of
twenty-four small kingdoms and principalities in Germany, which fill the pages of
that useful publication the Gotha Almanack.

   Wherever there is local Government we look for local statistics, as they aftbrd
means of information wliich enlightened municipal councillors cau always turn to
account, W'e may well believe that, as Adam Smith boasted he had converted
some of the merchants of Ghisgow to his doctrines before he had "promulgated
them to the world, his spirit lingers among their descendants, for the statistics of
that city have long held an honourable place on our rolls. The statistics of Glasgow
are (as indeed are those of any city) of universal interest, when they are collected

and discussed by such a statist as the late l)r. Strang, a truthful observer, a thought-
ful writer, and an excellent man. In the name of our Section I venture to say

that we shall be very glad if the Mayors (with the prosperity of Glasgow before
themj and all the town councils in England, Bath leading, will at once appoint

competent oihcers to elaborate their statistics.

   As well as Governments and municipal liodies, England has always at work in
the field of science richly gifted independent men, like Buckle and Darwin, who

devote their lives to science, either as observers or reasouers ; and as an example

of what an individual can do, I will cite Dr. Heysham, who twice enumerated from

house to house the population of Carlisle, abstracted the ages of the dead from
the burial registers, and published the results in a judicious form. The volume
Mr. Milne (as he informed me) found by chance on a book-stall; whereupon he
opened a con-espondence with Dr. Heysham, constructed the Carlisle Life Table,

and deduced a general law of mortality which served through many years as the

basis for thousands of transactions, and for the valuation of millions of property.

The names of the two men, the statistical observer and the statistical reasoner,
will remain for ever engraved upon our annals.

   It is evident that statistics may be investigated in every English parish ; and I
know no fairer field than local statistics oiler to a liberal and ingenuous mind.
Some subjects can be more impartially investigated by private gentlemen than
by men in office ; and a specimen is a paper by Mr. Norman, which is a model

of style and statistical logic, proving the fact, which at first appeared paradoxical,

that, large as the taxation is, the people of England pay less in proportion to their
means, and get more work for their money than the people of any other comitry*.
Again, the remarkable work before you of M. Guerry, on the comparative crime
of England and France, embodies the laboiu-s of the life of one of the most inge-

 nious private statists in Europef-

    The Statistical Society of London has done so much, by its papers and its Journal,
 in the eyes of Europe for science, that a similar Society has recently been founded
 in Paris, and publishes an excellent Journal, to which M. Legoyt and others con-

The Dublin and the Manchester Societies remiad us by their useful labours of the

utility of Statistical Societies in our great cities.

I admit that the country has a right to look to the Government for the census,

for registration returns, for commercial statistics, for agricultural statistics, for

industrial statistics, and for financial statistics, as the collection, analysis, and

promulgation of facts of imiversal interest is one of the Queen's most useful pre-

rogatives.  Formerly little or nothing of the                                                          kind  was  done                                                   but  by refen-ing  to

criminal and civil, the Consuls' Reports which the Foreign Office now publislies,

show that the Civil Service is everywhere anxious to do its duty. And I shall

perhaps be pardoned for reminding you that men in the Ci^'il Service are among

the great names of our science, from Petty, King, and Davenant, to Beacon Hume,

Porter, McCuUoch, John Mill, and, to cite no more contemporaries, Adam Smith

himself. The C'vnl Service of the present day is quite in a position to sustain the

statistical reputation of England in the face of Europe. What it wants is a better

coordination of its work ; which might, as was recommended by the Congress,

be accomplished by a board at which the principal offices should be re'presented.
   W^e venture in this Section to call the attention of Mr. Milner Gibson to the

organization of a central authority " to direct," in the words of the late Prince
Consort, " all the great statistical operations." Such a body has been recently

created in many of the States of Europe.
   Another matter this Association may very properly lu-ge on the same minister.

We ought, from agricultural statistics, to know approximately in October the pro-

duce of the harvest in Europe as well as in Amenca, and the state of the live stock
to supply the markets. The season has been extraordinary; what have been its
effects upon the crops ? Unfortunately the Government has nothing to tell us.
English agricultural statistics are a complete blank. Yet no one seriously doubts the
utility of this question of the supply of food, to town and country, to rich and poor,

to farmers and merchants ; it ^A\\ enter largely into the commercial combinations

of the next twelve months, and is one of the elements affecting the circulation.

The Registrar-General of Ireland procures the returns for that division of the

United Kingdom                                                                                    and the produce of the last harvest of Australia is known :                          it is

in some parts, if my memory series, half the average crop ; an unpleasant result,

which may influence the gold supply, but will partially be mitigated by timely

provisions to meet a loss the extent of which is already knowm.
   Mr. Hunt has just published a return of the mines of every kind, and of the

mineral produce of the kingdom. It is alike creditable to him, to Sir Roderick

Murchison, and to the mining proprietors, who voluntarily supplied the infornui-
tion. Some of them are not far from us, and will perhaps communicate the results

to the Section.

   I now come to our tools and our methods. Foremost in importance is the
question of statistical units. The Legislatm-e has just passed a measure authorizing
the use of the metric weights and measures in England ; and the report of a Com-

mittee of the Association on the subject will be presented to the Association by

Mr. Heywood. In the first stage of statistics we coimt ; but this no longer suffices,
and we have to weigh or measure.

   Upon the choice of units of weights and measures our progress in no slighlt
degree depends. Now, one weight will not serve all purjioses. Coal, for instance,
cannot be sold by the ounce, it is sold by the ton ; sugar by the hundredweight
tea by the pound; gold by the oimce ; while opium is administered in gi-ains. If

the hundredweight consisted of one hundred pounds, the ton of ten hundreds, the
ounce of the tenth of a pound, and all the units required in every trade were so

related to each other that we could say tens, hundreds, thousands, and so on, as we

do in common numeration, all the compound rules which fill our books of arith-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             --

metic and puzzle children ·svoiild be got rid of. So witli regard to measures and

--money let all the luiits increase by tens, and all goes " merry as a marriage hell."

One set of rides wiU apply to the weights, measures, and moneys of all trades and
of all nations which use the Arabic figures. With regard to money, we cannot do
better than adhere to the sovereign for statistical pui-poses : it is of gold, which is

becoming everywhere the standard of value, is the largest unit in use, and is admi-

rably suited to measure large values. The florin, and new farthings or mils, of
which 100 would make a florin, 1000= £1, are all the moneys of account required.
The penny will be 4 farthings, the shilling 50, and no change in the coinage is
requu-ed. The Chancellor of the Exchequer will, let us hope, inaugm-ate this

reform, which would be an immense boon to all classes that have anything to do

Rath bills, accounts, and statistics.

  We might decimalize our old weights and measures, but the several ranks of

units would not fit well into each other ; the change would give a great deal of
trouble, and there is no chance that other nations would adopt it, for this simple
reason, that the first nations have had for years the admirable metrical system in

use. Our merchants deal with these nations largely, and if we adopt the metre,

Russia, America, and om' colonies will adopt it. If England wills it, the whole
civilized world vnU. have one system of weights, measures, and money, as it has

one system of decunal arithmetic. This system annihilates those ugly pages of

Colenso, the compound rules ; so through it, in the words of the highest authority,
Professor Barlow, "a child may learn ever^'thing necessary for entering into the
common concerns of the world in a month as well and better than in a year under

our complicated system"*.

  A Metric Act will be an emancipation act for children, and wiU give them time

for higher studies in mathematics. The compoimd rules of arithmetic, English

orthography, and Latin verses, are the tasks for which the school-boy is oftenest

punished ; and they are the opprobrium of the age. Unlike the truths of science,

they can only be flogged into the brains of English boys. Statists should at once

make the pound sterling and the metric weights and measures their units.

In the English market gold and silver are sold by the ounce ; coflfee, tea, tobacco,

spices, indigo, silk, cotton, and leather                                                                                                       by the                                                                                          pound                             meat  by the  stone                        sugar,

butter, rice, by the hundredweight; coal, iron, copper, tin, lead, palm oil, logwood,

hemp, flax, by the ton; wool by the pack. For statistical pui-poses it is convenient

to take one unit, the metric ton=a cubic metre of water, and nearly equal to the

English ton, to express the imports and exports, and the quantities of all articles
sold by weight. 1 his would facilitate comparison. The quantities sold by voliuue,
such as wheat, fish, oil, wine, and spirits, might also be expressed by one unit
the metric tun, the bulk of water weighing a metric ton. The qualities and prices
of some articles, such as wheat and spirits, are regulated by the weight of equal
bulks, or by the specific gra\aty, which is ea.sily expressed as it is the weight of a

metric tun of the stuff", when a metric ton is taken for unity. Cloth, linen, calico,
and silk, are sold by linear units, which are exceedingly objectionable, and shoidd

be convei-ted into square units for statistical pui-poses.

In mechanics a unit of this kind is used                                                                                                                                                                                                     a  pound weight                            raised a foot is called
                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

a unit of work, .and 33,000 such imits of work in a minute, fonn the further unit

--Watt's horse-power. The unit of work may be called a double unit, inasmuch as
--it involves two elements weight (pound) and space (foot), while the horse-power

takes in time (minute), and is a treble unit. The French use a similar element

thus compounded : the horse-power is 75 Idlof/rams raised a metre in a second.

Remark that two of the elements of this unit are intangible. Chemistry furnishes

exaniples of compound units in its binary and ternary atoms. In statistics, double

and triple units are in use                                                                                                                     thus when I say the rate of mortality in a regiment                                                                                                                          is

These compound units are the sources of frec[uent faUacies; thus if the popula-

tion is compared with the deaths in a quarter, a week, a day, or any short interval

of time, the apparent mortality is reduced to any extent. In reckonin» interest

and profit-rates, £1 under investment a year is the double unit ; if the dividend
on £100 is £2 half-yearly, the rate of profit is £4 a year.

   The rate of profit is found by dividing (1) the profits by (2) the capital multi-

plied into (3) the thne.

Inattention to this principle is the source of some of the common fallacies on

the income-tax. Thus if two persons are taxed equitably on their property, they

are taxed in proportion to its amount and to the time it is under the protection of
A Bthe

                                    :

pay £1 every three months. BThe sophist assm-es that he pays at the same rate

as A, keeping out of view the fact that the taxable unit is compounded of value

Aand time. Income is an indication, but not a measure, of property, yet if has

a sum under investment in one way, he may have to pay at the rate of 6d., while
B with the same amount of property may now ha-ce to pay 10, 20, 30 sixpences as
Ahis quota of the year's taxation.
                                                               life income of £1000 a year on men of 20 and

upwards, at 5 per cent., is on an average worth £11,712; while at the same interest,

the same income in perpetuity is worth £20,006. The owners of two properties

taxed upon the same unit of value, pay £11712 and £20-000 as their quota of the

year's tax                                                 under an income-tax the same premium  is  exacted  from  properties  of

totally diflerent values.

The first step in every statistical inquiry is to determine the value of the units

to be employed, be they single, double, or multiple. Thus if you find that the
mines of a country yield 5000 tons of copper ore, while the mines of another ^aeld

10,000, these are only preliminary units ; the final statistical unit is the ton of

copper. So of all the minerals the ton of metal is the final unit. The heating
power of coal is the element of value, and as it can be measured, it should supply

the final unit.

In the statistics of products it is necessaiy to take time and space into the final

units of value ; thus coal at the pit's mouth is worth say 5s. a ton, and at this

price 40,000,000 tons are worth £10,000,000; but the consumer pays 10.s., 20*.,

30s., 40s. a ton for this coal, and its cost in consumption maybe £40,000,000. This

comprises the profit of the coal merchant, the interest of capital, the coal dues,
and the cost of transport, which varies with the supply of horses, roads, canals,

railways. Our exports and imports difier in value in the home and foreign market.
The value of products should be determined at every stage ; thus we should follow
wheat from the market tiU it becomes (1) flour and (2) bread, and take care that

in all these cases the units are so like in all their aspects as to admit of compaiison.
It does not foUow that two countiies which have the same numbers of cattle are

equally rich in that kind of stock ; the herds of cattle may diiFer in size, in age,

--in their amounts of produce of milk, butter, and meat in the quality of all tlieir

products. Horses differ still more in excellence. In Smithfield sheep are not
bought by the head, but by the stone ; the oftal is sunk, and the price varies from

6(7. to 8d. per pound in inferior and prime sheep. The butcher gets at, and the
statist uses, the pound of saleable meat as the final unit. All the elements which

the statist wants here are taken into account in the value of stock and of its produce;
with this he gets comparable units in every climate. Again, take land : land-mea-

sures vary. Statists gain a step by employing as their imit a hectar, or a square
of 100 metres to the side; it is a large acre, o'f which om- present acre is foui- teutlis.
The United Kingdom contains (31,367,507) thirty-one million hectars of laud,
rather more than a hectar to each person. This is the proportion of land to people

in a populous country; and the hectar is a convenient unit of area. England hns

15, Scotland 8, and Ireland 8 million hectars of land ; the popidation being 20 mil-

--lions in England, 3 millions in Scotland, and 6 in Ireland. The proportions in

ten are England 7, Ireland 2, Scotland 1 ; on areas related as 2, 1 and 1. Ireland

has still twice the population of Scotland. Italy has 26, Pmssia 29, Spain 51,
France 54, Austria 64 million hectars.

  We come to States of a very diflerent magnitude; the United States of America

hold 440, Turkey 474, Russia "in Europe 544 million hectars. Including the whole
--158 REPORT 1864.

of their subject territories, the United States possess 730, England has 1145. and
WeRussia 2133 million hectars.
                                do not accept this unit in statistics as the final
--unit of land. Land is rich, poor, or waste cultivated or uncultivated ; and a

hectar in the centi-e of l^ondon, in the vale of Gloucestershire, on the banks of the

Lena in Siberia, in MelboiuTie, and in the middle of Australia, is a verj' different
thine. All the chief elements that we need are summed up in the mean rahie of
a hectar; and in the usual divisions of hectars into arable, meadow, pasture, forest,
water, waste. The value of the land of the United States certainly exceeds that
of the Russian Empire ; in the absence of agricultural statistics, we do not know

the value of our land, but the value of the fixed property of the Isles of England
exceeds the value of the fixed property in either the Russian or American domi-

nions*. The value of a hectar is the final land unit.

As all the mechanical forces are expressible in units of weight, so the values of

land, of all property, of all products, are expressible in units of gold ; and we may

either measure those values, and express them in tons, or in any pieces of equal
Weweight of that metal.
                         take the sovereign for the statistical unit of value,
--because it is in use for the same reason as engineers take horse-power as the xmit

of work.

   "What are we to say to the human imit ? Here also distinctions have to be
drawn. As hectars differ, so does the average man of different states. Besides
the divisions incidental to sex and age, the work of different races of men varies

in quantity; a navvy, a Siberian peasant, a Hindoo, a Negro, a Chinaman, an
Esquimaux, do very different quantities of work in the year.

   The mechanical force of a country is the sum of the working forces of its popu-

lation, with its steam-engines, horses, winds, waters, which can all be measured

by the engineer's unit of work. Adam Smith proposed to employ a unit of laboiir

as the unit of value. The wages of men express the value of their labour in gold,

and from the mean value of these earnings at different ages of life, the economic
value of a man is calculated by taking the interest of money and the contingencies

of his life into account. At the age of 25, the present value of the future earn-

ings of an English agricultural labourer, after deducting the cost of necessary

maintenance, is £246t. The value of the mean worktime of artisans, artists, and
professional men, varies indefinitely: and as it is evident that the human units

dirt'er, so the difference can be appreciated by the value of their works. Nations

differ in their intellect as well as in their moral faculties ; and the expression of

these forces of the soul, whether we look at scientific achievements or vulgar

errors, at virtues or crimes, is one of the difficult problems in statistics. It is by
the correct appreciation of units, of the things signified by figures, that the

statist is distinguished from the empiric who throws heaps of tables in our faces,

and asserts that he can prove anything by figures.
   After observation, discrimination of units, and expression of their numbers in

flsfures, come the exposition of facts in tables or diagrams, and the determination
of their relations by mathematical analysis. Logarithms facilitate the calculation
of ratios ; and the calculus of probabilities enables the statist from the past to pre-

dict the future within determinable limits of en-or. Prediction is a function of

this, as it is of all the sciences. The exposition of doctrines, and the use of them
in argument, to induce men to follow a course of action, is an important part of
statistics ; and as it is connected with politics, has been carried to a high pitch of
excellence in England. Several of the pieces of Burke, some extant speeches of

Pitt, and in recent times the speeches of Huskisson, of Peel, and of the Chancellor

of the E.xchequer, as well as articles in the newspapers and reviews of the higher

class, offer examples of this order of eloquence.

   Statistics admit of many practical applications, and this naturally commends

the study to the minds of Englishmen. I will mention an example. In the first

place, as* we have had a minister, we have had statistics of trade, and from the

sided over by Mr. Fonblauque, the statistics of trade have formed the basis of a
large field of economical reasoning. They guided Huskisson, Peel, Graham, and
Gladstone in legislation, by showing the exact effects of rates of duty on the
revenue, and on the property of the coimtry. Yes, the statistics of Deacon Hume,
of Porter, of Tooke, ot Newmarch, of Wilson, of M'GuUoch, and of our blue

books, have accelerated the march of free trade, and banished Protection from the

shores of England. Statistics, pm-suiug her through the world, are demonstrating

her disastrous influences in every land. Figures show, year after year, that every

country which isolates itself from mankind by prohibition, no matter what may be

the natm-al riches of its soil and climate, withers under the influences of protective
tariffs. The people out of the open air of competition grow idle and weak. The

imports of 1861 (in England) were of the value of 217 millions sterling, and the

exports of 160 millions, including 35 millions of foreign and colonial merchandise

the revenue was £70,600,000, and exceeded the expenditure. What do the sta-

Whytistics of Austria show us ?                                                                                                                                  in 1861-62 her total imports were 22 millions

sterling, her exports 34 millions ; her revenue 40 millions, her expenditure 51 mil-
lions and as a consequence her debt is accunmlating in geometric progression

                        ;;

her credit is low, and her paper is depreciated. This magnificent empire, of 36
millions of the finest races of Europe, ^vith minerals in the Garpathiaiis, Bohemia,
and the Alps, with 64 million hectars of land stretching over the rich plains ou the
Upper Elbe and the Danube, is thus crippled by a good Emperor and a patriotic

Chamber, on the speculation that certain manufactures will prosper ultimately in

Austria if they are nursed and encouraged at the expense of the nation for some

indefinite time.

   France has been drawn towards free trade by statistics ; her exports are 123 mil-
lions sterling in value; and by the de'Nelopment of her resources, she does not yet

falter under an annual expenditure of 83 millions sterling.
   Spain, which has broken the chains of the Inquisition, is still in the fetters of

protection, that is, still makes her people pay dear for goods to satisfy their wants

her imports are of the value of only 15 millions sterling, her revenue is only 20

millions, and she is unable to pay her debts, so that she is without the legitimate

credit which a nation containing many men of the nicest honour can justly claim.
   The United States' statistics offer the saddest illustration of the effects of levy-

ing protective duties; their imports (1860-61) were 67 millions sterling; their
revenue was 10 millions in 1861-62, exclusive of loans, and their expenditure, it is

said, was 114 millions ; and higher rates of import duties on the class of articles

manufactured in New England will necessarily reduce the amount of revenue. The

present war was kindled by combustible materials, of which protective duties form

no insignificant item.
   The statistical argument in favour of free ti-ade is accumulating : it gains fresh

force in eveiy table, and will in the end lead all nations to exchange their products

freely.

Another thing statistics does                                                                                                                                    it enables Governments to coimt the  cost of war,
                                                                                                                                                              ;

and to weigh its results against its expenses.

There can be no doubt that statistics, by disclosing the laws of life and repro-

duction, tends to improve the health and mornl condition of the people, to point

out the causes of disease, and to prove so plainly the utility of sanitary measm'es,

that the people become willing to pay the expenses. In England the Registrar-

General has, during twenty-seven years, shown how much the public health is

deteriorated by destructive causes ; so in our towns they are in the cour.se of re-

moval the Registrar-General of Scotland and Dr. Stark have lately done the same
                                   ;

there, and in the present year the Registrar-General of Ireland and Dr. Burke, fol-

lowing Sir William Wilde, have entered the field. Our anny has been invigorated

by statistics ; and the Commission over which Lord Herbei-t first, and after his

death. Lord Stanley so ably presided, has proposed to endow India with the sani-

tary institutions of England. Under the eminent man who now governs India, the

English race, which has hitherto languished in that paradise, will, we may hope,

taste the fruits of the tree of life, and perpetuate itself in the tropics among the
natives who also descend from the original Aryan stock.

Statistics, it must be confessed, has done little for mankind yet, in compaiison

with its vast powers. lunumerable social problems are still unsolved, and politics,

which Alerabert justly pronounced, in the ' Cyclopaedia,' "perhaps the most diffi-

cult of aU the sciences," is eveiy day making fresh demands on statistics. Take

the Balance of Power. How are political powers to be measm-ed, and how is the

statesman to construct his parallelogram of forces ? In past times France, tlie

Emperor, and England were the principal powers ; and the problem had then the

complications of the three bodies in mechanics, but England, France, and Austria

have now Prussia and Russia by their sides, to say nothing of Turkey; Spain is

rising again, and the Italian sword is asserting its place ; the two States of America

disjoined, are two of the great powers of the world, with which Europe will

have to reckon.  Italy was  comminuted      into  small  States                                                       it is now one power.
                                                                                             ;

And latterly Germany--still in two great masses, and a multitude of fragments,

which have" been as dust in the balance--coalescing, has planted herself on the neck

of the Baltic in the face of Russia and Sweden, England and France looking on.

Here is a mass of 72,000,000 men, with its due proportion of needle-rifles, and a

navy, not yet formidable. It has nearly, but not quite, twice the population of

France (37,386,313) with her rectified frontier; against wliich Denmark, with only

2,605,024 people, or, excluding German Holsteiners, two millions dared gallantly

to defend her frontiers ; bat which the Emperor of the French did not deem it

prudent to encounter for the sake of an old ally of France in the company of

-- --England, with the coveted Rhine that German river before his armies.

This population of the German States is split up (our statistics show^ into 36

--million Austrians, 18 million Prussians, and 18 million Germans comminuted in

cities and principalities ^but scarcely powers. And if it has France on the west

flank it has Russia, with what may be taken at 66 million people, on the eastern

--frontier, not very distant from Berlin and Vienna. Germany has also unfriendly

races within its limits Poles, Himgarians, and Italians who divide Austria from

the sea. Between Germany and Russia lies Poland, in pieces and ashes, but still

exhaling her indestructible soul in one flame to heaven. The tine Scandinavian

race has fallen back behind the Baltic, before the masses of Russia and Gemiany,

and stands at bay, looking towards England. In the south is looming, we are re-

minded, the possible coalition of the Latin races in face of the descendants of those

Germans who broke the power of the Roman empire. Over the Atlantic, 8 millions

were added to the population of the United States in ten years ; and at the same

rate of increase, the people on the ample territories will amomit to 42 millions in

six years', to 50 millions in sixteen years' time. Our colonies are increasing at as
Howfast a rate, and repose secure in peace under the sceptre of the Queen.
                                                                                                                                           are

all these bodies to be balanced ? Flow is the power of each State to be measured?

The first step in the solution of the problem of equilibrium is natm-ally the de-

termination of the popidation, and of the value of the wealth or credit which nerves

Whenthe sinews of war.      this is done for each State, the unit to get at is the

precise worth of the fighting man and officer; the muubers of such units in sernce

and in reseiTe ; the arms, fortresses, and ships. It was enough not long ag;o to

count the ships of the line, frigates, and  other vessels                                                             for when  the naval  histo-

rian had told, in addition to the number of ships and men, the number of guns at
Aboukir or Trafalgar, his readers were satisfied. The unit of naval force is now

--by no means so simple ; it is compounded of the velocity of the ship and its resist-

ing power as well as of the weight, velocity, and destructive force of its shot and

shells. Strategic position, administration, fertility of military genius, are all ele-

ments of power to be taken into account. What minister knows at this hour the

military force in war of his own State with any degree of accm-acy ? or can weigh
the force of other States in his balance ? What means has he of judging of the

number of possible adverse or favoiu-able combinations ? As the number of States

increases, the possible combinations increase more rapidly. Thus take England,

France, or Austria, and there are only three possible combinations of two against

one ; throw in Russia and Prussia, and the possible combinations are ten of three

Eowers against two, and five of fom- powers against one; and one, two, or three may

e neutral while the rest are at war. England, France, Prussia, Austria, Russia,

Italy, Spain, Tm-key, the Federals, and Confederates, constitute ten States of 293

millions ; that is 29-3 millions to each on an average ; and ten combinations can

                                                                                                                                                   1

Then if we introduce the element of neutrality, the combinations are still further

multiplied ; and there remains the sepai-ate probability of each alliance. After all

difficulties of the problem, and will appreciate the value of the facts which they

-- --require from statistics and which the Houses of Parliament require to aid them

in deciding questions of international policy. In steering the vessel of the State

over the ocean our captains cannot now entirely rely upon their stars ; they must

consult their "Nautical Almanack."

Besides the problem of equilibrium, there remain others of equal difficulty.

Aristotle, Comte, and other thoughtful theorists, looked with favour on the orga-
nization of mankind in small States. But while small States often exhibit great

intellectual activity, and in Judea, Greece, Italy, Switzerland, Hollaud, Frankfort,

Weimar, Wiirtemberg, and elsewhere, have nurtured men of transcendent genius,
they exist now by sufferance ; they exert little direct influence on the political

affairs of mankind. Property is less secure in these dominions than it is in large

States ; and their defence is more difficult, and in proportion much more expen-
sive. Thus, to say nothing of smaller States, Bavaria, to keep the same army in

the field as Prussia, must draw four times as deeply on the resources of her people.

Sweet are the charms of small Courts and local Government yet the people of
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

small States are, as in Italy, yielding by degrees to the soft compulsion of powerfid

neighbours ; and the great continental powers, as their population increases, evince

a passion for the sea, to which the small States upon the coasts may not for ever

ofter an efiectual barrier. Still a valiant nation in hearty cohesion, feeble in aggres-

sion, cannot be subjugated by a nation of four or perhaps ten times its magnitude
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

--as was seen in the cases of Greece and Persia, of Prussia imder Frederick who
--with 5 millions of people fought 100 millions in Austria and Switzerland, Spain

and the Netherlands, England and America. The population of England was

about 10,530,000, and that of the whites in the States 2,614,000, holding half

a million slaves, in the war when the colonists resisted brave British armies,

until the intervention of France and other Em'opean powers closed the unavailing

contest.

   In spoiling Poland three great powers participated ; and Hungary in the war of
1848 was only recovered by Austria with the aid of Russia. Each of the great

--powers of Europe has fought and is able to defend its existence for a time against
--Europe in coalition, so long as the hearts of the people are loyal.

 --The solution of the problem can 19 Free States conquer 15 Slave States, can

might have prevented a desolating war. And statistics supplies but one solution.

   The census was taken in the United States in 1790, eleven years before the first
English census ; and the last report by Mr. Kennedy is one of the fullest of which
statistics can boast. From this it appears that the 697,897 slaves of 1790 had

midtiplied so rapidly, that they amoimted to 3,95.3,760 in 1860 ; and this increase
proves that the physical condition of the slaves and thek health are, as the

Southerners tell us, good in a warm climate. They cannot possibly, in the aggre-

gate, like the blacks in Cuba, be worked to death by the masters of English blood,
and their conduct during the war confirms this inference. The present Southerners

did not, as Sir George Lewis remarks of the Greeks, invent slaveiy; they inherited
it under their laws, and are in the same uneasy situation as masters woidd be here,

who had paid their servants wages for life in advance. With the growth of popu-

lation, the equitable abolition of slavery in America, like the abolition of serfdom

in Europe, is only a question of time, to be worked out in peace as the prosperity
of the South increases yet the institution of slavery is so much at variance with

                                                                                                           ;

eionate war, which haa a tragic interest, has shown that though the British race

has undergone changes, such as Sir Charles Lyell pointed out, it has lost none of

its valour, none of its endurance and none of its military genius in America since

the days of Washington. It is rather exposed to the reproach Hume addressed to

England, of lighting on uselessly in stubborn anger, when the object of the war is

attained, or is unattainable, than to that of imitating the new fashion set by the

Emperor of the French in the Crimea and Lombardy.

As the war proclaims the power of two nations, Kennedy's ample statistics fill

us with astonishment at their achievments in all the arts of life ; and if Frederick

in Prussia, and Peter in Kussia, are justly, for founding two great powers, called

Great, that title cannot be withheld trom'the nations sprung from the men whom

England sent over the waves of the Atlantic.

In Bath Abbey, I am reminded, lie quietly the ashes of Malthus, one of the

fathers of statistics, and one of the foimders of this Section of the Association at

Cambridge. In his celebrated work he deduced from all the information then ex-

tant respecting the populations of the earth, the well-known law that population

increases in geometrical progression. The first pliilosophic naturalist of his age

assures us that this law rules in every species of plant and animal ; and that he

derived from Malthus the conception of the struggle for existence, which, with

the tendency to variations of form and natural selection always operating in favour

of the best, through the millions of ages which our President unrolled before us

last night, wi-ought those miracles of organization which we now regard with

wonder and awe.

Malthus did not, however, sufficiently advert to one great characteristic of man,

which distinguishes him from all his fellow creatures. The lion and the eagle prey

iipon the fawn and the lamb, but do not breed them ; and even the busy bee only

gathers honey from flowers existing. Man, by his industry, creates flowers, fruit,

grain, and  all products ;  his  science  places  the forces  of  nature                                                                                          in  his  hands                                his
                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

powers of transport give him the use of the lands of all climates ; and hence subsis-

tence has increased during the present century in a more rapid geometrical progres-

sion than the numbers of the people in England. Hence her numerous cities, her full

ports and her cultivated fields ; hence the States of America, hence Canada and its
sister provinces, hence the colony of the Cape, Australasia, and our Indian Empire.

If, like the power of Imperial Rome, whose ruined temples lie imder our feet in the

streets of Bath, England should ever decline and pass away, she will not have

existed in vain ; she will leave eternal traces of her life in the life of mankind ; and
our dry fossil figures, read by the Macaulay of a later age, will reveal the works

in America, in Australia, and India of a great nation. But hitherto no signs of

decay are visible; our population is to-day in its youth; it has proportionably more

young men in it than any other people in Europe ; who in no respect, take them

in the ranks of the Volunteers or in the Sections of the British Association, need

--fear a comparison with their contemporaries. The English race the greatest of
--the nationalities amidst all the coalescing nations, yields all the signs of being able

to hold her own for ages to come. Yes

organized the pensioners ; his ability in administration induced the Government

service to his country, helped to save the army, and afterwards endured a persecu-
tion which he merited only by honesty and endured with brave constancy. M.

"\'illerm(S in France is a great name gone; we may place it after that of M. Qui^telet.

His contributions to statistics are clear, truthful, and practical. Like the Earl of
Shaftesbm-y, he strove to do good to workmen by judicious regulations. In Germany
Dr. Casper, a most amiable and excellent physician, has left works which are often

     On the Rates of Mortalitij and Mai-nar/e amongst Europeans in India.
                                By Samuel Brown, F.R.S.

   After some introductory remarks, supported by very sugo;estive and encouraging,
because low, ratios of mortality among Europeans in Iiidia, the author s'tated

that, in reference to the mortality amongst civilians in India, the general conclu-
sions at which he had arrived fi'om a large mass of original observations which he

had laid before the Section, are :--1. That a considerable diminution has taken

place of late years in the mortality at the middle ages (twenty to thirtj^-five), and

at aU ages if we compare it with the earlier observations of the present century
2. that a very marked distinction may be observed in favour of married life

3. that, as compared with Farr's English healthy life-table, the difference varies
from § to 1 per cent, between the ages twenty and fifty-five, after whicli it fluc-
tuates, but is generallj^ rather higher than the English rate. Otlier statistics are

also given with regard to marriage. This subject may be fully illustrated by some

facts which have been collected recently in a paper read before tlie Statistical
Society, and published in the ' Statistical .lournal,' by Mr. P. M. Tait. The
Eurasians, as the name indicates, are a mixed race, the descendants of Europeans

(originally, to a great extent, Portuguese) and Asiatic parents. Latterly the

British is the predominant European element; but the name appears applied

--indiscriminately to the children of other colonists Jews, Syrians, Christian

Arabs, Armenians, Persians, Danes at Serampore, Chinese, and Americans. They
are looked upon with some prejudice by the natives, being described as having
the vices of the natives and Europeans without the probity of the latter. But
they are much employed in the superior government offices ; and some Indian
officers who have employed them bear witness to their quickness at computation,
intelligence, probity, and unquestionable loyalty. They form a large proportion of
the members of the Uncovenanted Service Pension Fund. Out of 945 who entered
in twenty-four years, ending 20th April 1857, there were 093 of this class, or 73
per cent., 246 Europeans, or 2G per cent., and the remaining 8, or 1 per cent, were

not described. Hitherto the mortality of Eurasians has been thought to be greater
than that of Europeans, and some assurance companies decline them at European
rates of premiimi ; but at ages under forty it seems that about 13'5 Eurasians die
per 1000, and 17'6 civilians. It is probable, however, that, with the recent
improvement in European life in India, the difference would be found scarcely
perceptible. In the recent and very elaborate ' Report of the Commissioners
appointed to inquire into the Sanitary State of the Ai-my in India,' in which Dr.
Fan- took so conspicuous a part, the fullest evidence was taken upon every subject
that affects the health or mortality of the Indian army, the causes of the excess of
the death-rate amongst Europeans as compared with natives, and the remedies
suggested for its almost entire disappearance.

                                    By W. Chexavtnd.

   Between September 1861 and Midsummer 1864, 3000 of these banks had been
established in the United Kingdom ; and the amount standing in the names of the
depositors up to that time, vdth accimiulations of interest, amounted to upwards

of four millions.

Statistics relative to the Bristol Coal-Field. By Handel Cossham.

The whole basin within the limits of the mountain limestone ridge, extending

from Wickwar on the north to the Mendip Hills on the south, contains about 150

square miles, two-thirds of which lie on the south, or Somersetshire side of
Bristol ; but, being so largely covered up by overlying strata of lias, new red sand-

stone, and even tlie oolitic limestone, it has been mucli less worked, and is not so

well understood as many of our other coal-fields. The author thinks that energy

and enterprise will develope and utilize the vast mineral resources of this district

much more largel}^ in the future. The northern portion of the Bristol coal-field

aroimd Kingswood Hill has probably been worked for 300 or 400 years ; and in

the district of Moorwood and Vobster, adjoining the Mendip Plills, there are

evidences of very ancient and extensive mining operations. The area of this coal-

field is thus stated :

                                                       Tons to work.

It is more difficult to estimate the quantity to be worked on the Somersetshire
side : 1,000,000,000 tons is witliin the mark. This gives 1700 years as the probable
duration of the Bristol coal-field at the present rate of production. The total

--quantity of coal now raised annually is about 1,000,000 tons namely, 550,000

tons on the northern side, and 450,000 tons on the Somersetshire side. This forms
about one-eightieth part of the total quantity raised in the United Kingdom. There

is no doubt that the Bristol coal-field is capable of afibrding a much greater yield
than it now produces, provided more capital and skill are brought to bear upon

its development.

On Military Statistics of certain Armies, especially those of the United States.

                          By E. B. Elliott, of Washington.

   The author called attention, first, to the rates of siclmess experienced by the
Danish forces during the late conflict in Schleswig-Holstein ; secondly, to the rates
of sickness, mortality', and other casualties experienced by the United States 'S'olun-
teers dm'ing the first fifteen months of the existing civil war ; and, thirdly, to cer-
tain physiological characteristics of the United States Volunteers, and the laws
which govern the distribution of certain measurements. According to official data
kindly furnished by the distinguished chief of the medical bureau, the following
rates of sickness, in hospitals and quarters, obtained at the different dates specified :
February 27th, 10-20 to 1000 numerical strength; March 20th, 9-75; April 23rd,

14-20; May 28th, 11-90; June 25th, 850; July 30th, 8-85. These rates average

about ten and one-half per cent, of the mean numerical strength of the amiy. The
sickness rate was lowest just previous to the taking of Alsen (June 29th), and high-
est on the 23rd of April, a lew days subsequent to the taking of Duppel, by the
allies (13th April). The increase in April, attending the taking of Duppel, was due
both to wounds received in action and to the greater prevalence of the zymotic class
of diseases. The average rate was nearly identical with the sickness rate of the
United States' forces during the nine earlier months of the existing civil war (10-4
?er cent.), and less than the rate for the subsequent six months (16-9 per cent.),

   he mortality of the United States' volunteers during the fifteen months, July 1861,
to Aiigust 1862, inclusive, as deduced fi'om careful and elaborate examination of
the official monthly retiu'ns of strength and casualties of regiments, conducted under

--the auspices of the Sanitaiy Commission, was at the annual rate of somewhat over

seven (7-2) in eveiy 100 men of which two (2-0) were from killed in action, and
five (5-2) from diseases and accidents. The rate of mortality of officers from dis-
ease, as in other wars, has been kss than that of the men, but from wounds recei\ed
in action much greater. The mortality from wounds, both of officers and men, has

in general been considerably less than that fi'om disease, although the mortality of

officers in the latter part of the period the reverse has been the case, their mortality

from wounds having somewhat exceeded that from disease. The rate of mortality
in the existing war (7'2 per cent, per annum), for the period under consideration,
although much greater than that of civilians of the military age, both in Europe and
America, and greater than that of the army of the United States in time of peace, has
been less than that of the United States' forces during the war against Mexico, and

very considerably less than that of the British forces on the Spanish Peninsula (in
1811-14) and in "the Crimea (1854-56) ; the average annual rate in the Spanish Pe-
ninsula hawing been 16^ per cent., and in the Crimea about 23 per cent., the last-
mentioned rate only embracing those dying in hospitals, and not including deaths
on the field of battle. This smaller rate of mortality, as compared with those of
the other protracted wars mentioned, is believed to be due, in no small degree, not
merely to the early organization, by the people, of systematic methods of inquiiy

--into the condition of the soldier, and of timely relief to the suffering prompted
--by the noble examples and wise teachings of the Herberts and Nightingales, and

other practical philanthropists of Europe but also in part to the oixmipresent re-

presentatives of the press of the country, continually informing as to the condition

and the wants of the different corps and subdivisions of the army. The casualties
from all causes have been at the rate of 28 per cent, per annum of the strength, to
wit, seven from deaths, twelve discharged from service, mainly for disability, six
deserted, and three missing in action. The number discharged for disability is
much larger than it would have been had greater care been taken by the surgeons

iu conducting the medical examinations of recruits presenting themselves for ac-

ceptance. In the early part of the war, the gi-eatest laxity prevailed in this regard,
and thousands have been discharged from the service for hernia and other disabling

infirmities, under which they were labouring at the time of enlistment. Of ten
thousand (9835) recruits from the North Eastern States of Vermont, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, and Connecticut, about 30 per cent. ; and of sixteen thousand
(16,404) from the North Western States of Indiana, Michigan Lower, and Minne-
sota, 12i per cent., represented themselves as of foreign birth. The paper also gave
the average ages, heights, circumference of chests, weight, and other characteristics
of the American soldier, illustrated by comparisons with British, French, and
Prussian data ; and accompanied with tables showing the distribution, both observed
and calculated, of the soldiers with respect to such characteristics, together with
an analytical statement of the mathematical laws which govern the distribution.

    Ou the Causes which Produce the Present High Rate of Discount.
                           By Prof. Henet Fawcett.

    The author considered, first, whether the high rate which at present exists was

likely to remain permanent, and, secondly, whether the high rate was an evil in

itseli', and whether it wanted any special kind of remedy to remove it. Some City

men were expressing their abhorrence of the Bank Chai'ter Act^that to this Act

--was to be attributed the present state of things that money was getting too dear,

and there was no knowing what would be the result if the Act were not repealed.

He contended that the Bank Charter Act had nothing to do with causing this high

rate of discount, and that Her Majesty's Government would be guilty of great va-

cillation and weakness if they listened to the ciy which had been got up against

the Bank Act by interested speculators, and repeal a statute that ought to be ad-

hered to with the utmost firmness. So long as they had prudent men governors

of  the Bank of England,  as at present, they would  have nothing to  fear                      because,
                                                                                             ;

whether compelled to do so or not, they would always keep in the coffers of the

Bank sufficient bullion with which to meet the dimands that might be made upon

them. The Act ought not to be suspended. It should either be repealed once and

for all or rigidlv adhered to, even if the rate of discount advanced far beyond its

Apresent amount.  high rate of interest could not fairly be attributed to a high

rate of discount. Just as with all other commodities, the price of money varied

with the supply and demand ; and there could he no doubt that the present high
rate was produced by an activity of speculation which had caused a great demand
for capital, and by the heavy exports of specie to the East. There was no cause
for alarm if the demand for borrowing still continued. The remedy could only be
the rise of price to such a point as would check those who wished to borrow, and
gradually, as the rate rose, money would be attracted from foreign countries to
England, and in time we should obtain all that we required. There was every
reason to expect that a much higher rate of interest was likely to prevail for some
years to come than had prevailed for years past ; because the export of capital was
"likely to increase rather than decrease, owing to the establishment of so many

banks of late in all parts of the world.

  Notes on a Cotton-Chart, slioiving the Effect on Cotton of the Civil War in
      America. Bij Colonel C. W. Gkant, B.E., late Bombay Engineers.

   The cotton-chart exhibited at the Section showed, by diagrams of ascending and
descending lines of red, blue, and black, the quantity of cotton imported respectively
from India and America, and the total imports from its earliest introduction to the
present time ; the fluctuations in the prices were sho-mi by thin red and blue lines,
and at the sides of the chart were the actual number of bales and prices corre-
sponding to these lines, with the years and dates below ; the proportionate quantity
of cotton received from all parts was also shown by circular areas of dift'erent
colours ; the cost of cultivation in India and America of slave- and free-grown

cotton, &c.

   The following Table will best show the chief results elicited in the chart :

 prices were 29^d. per lb. for Egyptian and 2.3if7. per lb. for Dhollera, or nearly

Jtve times the prices in 1860. In 1860 we paid about £36,000,000 for cotton ; in

 1864 nearly £74,000,000, or more than double, and more than the total revenue of
 Great Britain, namely, £70,000,000, for one article of import alone. In 1862
nearly 40 J,000 operatives were thrown out of employ by the stoppage of the cotton-

mills, and the pauperism amounted to 240 in the 1000, who were supported by
voluntary subscriptions chiefly ; now the pauperism is Go in the 1000.

    Yet notwithstanding- this vast drain of money, this want of employment for
tens of thousands, the country flourished. The revenue in 1863-64 was £70,000,000.

The exports, which in 1860 (the most flourishing commercial year on record)
 amounted to £135,000,000, and fell to £125,000,000 in 1861 and to £127,000,000 in

 1862, ROSE to £146,000,000 in 1863 and to £160,000,000 in 1864, or £25,000,000

more than in 1860. And that private wealth kept pace with that of the country
may be gleaned from the asserted fact that in 1864 the amount invested in new

companies was no less than £192,000,000 of which £22,000,000 was paid up.
    So much for England and the manner in which she has weathered the storm

now see the eftect on India and some other countries. In 1860 we paid for Indian

cotton only £3,500,000 ; in 1864 nearly £37,000,000 ; and in 1863 £36,000,000
or including 1865 nearly £100,000,000 in three years, of which a very large propor-

tion was paid in hard cash. In 1860 we paid £1,500,000 for cotton from Egvpt,
and in 1864 we paid her £14,000,000. In 1864 we also paid about £10.000,000 for

cotton to the Brazils, China, and Japan. So true is it, " that it is an ill wind that

blows nobody good."

Statement of the Mortality of the City of Bath. By E. T. Goee.

The author, after a few preliminary remarks, epitomized the sanitary statistics

of the city and its vicinity thus :

  --General Summary of Mortality. The total population of the city, according to

the last census, and including the workhouse and hospitals, may be taken at 52,500,

--and the total deaths as follows : Lansdown, 341 ; Walcot, 280 ; Abbey, 298

Lyncombe and Widcombe, 214 ; Bathwick, 91. Total, 1224. To these must be

added, for deaths of persons belonging to city parishes, in the workhouse, 59 ; in

United Hospital, 67. Total deaths, 1350. Population as above, 52,500 ; deaths,

1350. Ratio to population, 25-714; ranging from, Bathwick, 17-28 to, in Abbey

--district, 27-09. Of the total deaths, the numbers, at certain ages, are as follows :

ing to all districts both in town and coimtry, that, dm-tng the year in question, there

was a prevalent epidemic of scarlatina, with a heavy rate of mortality. Thus, in

the Twerton district, of 166 deaths, 51 were from scarlatina, and of these 29 in
the quarter ending March 31, 1864. In the Batheaston district, of 128 deaths, 16
were from scarlatina. In Lansdown district, of 341 deaths, 62 were fi-om the same
cause, and of these 62 were in young persons fi-om infancy to 22 years of age.

    Dr. Faraday, in his evidence before the Public Schools' Commission (1862),
mentions his opinion that one-fifth certainly of the time which an individual

devotes to study, ought to be devoted to the attainment of natural knowledge.

   "The first thing to do," remarks the leai-ned Professor, "is to give scientific

teaching an assured and honoured place in education.
    " The study of natm-al science is so glorious a school for the mind that, with the

laws impressed on all created things by the Creator, and the wonderful unanimity
and stability of matter, and the forces of matter, there cannot be a better school

for the education of the mind."

   With such obvious advantages ai'ising from the study of natural science, an
inquiry may be made why the great public schools of this country do not encourage

ma larger amount of class or school lessons in natural philosophy, as well as

other modem subjects of instruction.

   The Royal Commissioners remark in their report, that in the public schools

there is especial deficiency in arithmetic and French and they observe that the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

path of promotion, and the subjects in which the time and thoughts of the boys
are employed, are mainly classical ; the traditions of the most ancient public

schools are classical ; the chief honours and distinctions of those seminaries are

classical ; and the head master and, where the tutorial system exists, the tutors

are men distinguished chiefly as classical scholars.
   To improve the existing system, a school council is suggested by the Royal Com-

missioners, consisting of the assistant masters, or a selected number of them, repre-
senting the whole body ; and, in the latter case, the classical and the mathematical

masters, and the teachers of modem languages and natural sciences respectively,

are recommended to be duly represented on the council. The head master is pro-
posed to preside, if present, and matters conceming the teaching or discipline of
the school are intended to be considered by the council.

   In University College School, London, the head master is requested by the
governing body of that institution to call together the assistant masters at least once
in every term, to consult with them as to the management and an-angement of the

classes; and the views of parents maybe communicated to the head master regard-

ing such subjects as Greek, mathematics, natural philosophy, chemistrj', and

Genu an.

   School lessons at University College School are distributed in a week from
Monday morning to Saturday afternoon in the following manner :

   Latin occupies 9 hours in each week in every class ; but neither Greek nor
Latin verse compositions form any part of the system of lessons at the school.

   French has G hom-s a week assigned to it in each of the three junior classes,
and 3 hours a week in each of the three senior classes.

   German occupies 2^ hours in a week in the senior classes ; and Greek has 4^
hours a week in the classical subdivisions of those classes, its place being taken in

the other subdivisions of the upper classes by more modem subjects, such as

writing, arithmetic, geography, English, history, mathematics, natural philosophy,
and social science.

       On the British Home and Colonial Empire in its Mutual Relations.
                           By Lieutenant- Colonel Kennedt.

    The object of this paper was to combat the notion that the colonies are useless
appendages to the British empire. It pointed out the advantages which the colo-
nies derive from the mother country, by the protection aftbrded to their commerce
on the high seas by means of the strongest navy in the world, which costs them
nothing. It proves the benefits which the mother country derives from her colo-
nies, exclusive of British India, by their high consumption of British manufactures
(£3 6s. lOf/. per head of population) as compared with the consumption of the rest

--of the world who are not under the British flag 2s. 4f7. per head, which is in the

   On the Economical Administration of the Navy. By Prof. Leone Levi.

   The naval expenditure constituted 30 per cent, of the total amount of the supply
services voted by the House of Commons, and, in the forces of the coimtiy, the
navy held the first rank. It was shown that, in the time of war, the average cost
per man, a hundred years ago, was £08 per man ; whereas, in the Eussian war, it
was £270 per man. In times of peace, the cost, a hundred years ago, was £105 per

--man ; whereas, at present, it was £1.50 per man. But a great change had taken

place in the state of the navy first, in the size of ships, and, second, in the intro-

duction of steam.

      Statistics on the Numher and Occupations of Foreigners in England.

                                      By Prof. Levi.

   According to the last census there were 80,090 foreigners in England and Wales,
being at the rate of 0-0-41 to every 100 natives. That, however, was considerably
less than the number of foreigners in France or the United States. In France, in
1861, there were 506,381 foreigners in a population of 37,386,313 ; and, in the
L^nited States, in 1860, there were 4,136,17.5 foreigners out of a popidation of
27,489,461. Of the 80,090 foreigners in England and '^'S'ales 73,000 were Eui-opeans,
9500 Armenians, 500 Afi'icans, and 500 between Asiatics and natives of other coun-
tries. Of the 73,000 Europeans 30,900 were Germans, 13,000 were French, 5500

were from Holland, 4500 from Italy, 5000 from Norway and Sweden, 5000 from

Russia and Poland, 2000 from Spain and Portugal, 2000 from Belgium, and 2500
from Denmark, and about 1000 from Greece and Turkey. Frdly one half of the
foreigners in England and Wales are located in London. Of the total number of
foreigners in this country, 57,000 are males and 27,000 females ; and, of the 73,000
Europeans, 13,000 were under twenty years of age.

tions, perpendicular, horizontal, sloping to tlie right, and sloping to the left, make
twelve distinct signs. As these are not sufficient to supply one for every con-
sonant, recourse is then had to some appendage to the straight line, as a hook or
a circle. The expeiimeut of at once doubling the number of straight lines and
curves by- writing them light and heavy was first made in Phonography ; and, as
the principle waa employed in this system, it proved in practice a remai'kable suc-

cess.

   Consonant sounds are divisible into two classes, which may generally be desig-

nated as breath letters and voice letters. It was found that in English the breath
letters exceed in number the voice letters in the propoition of live to two. The

breath letters are k, p, t, sh (called ish as a letter, heard in wis/t), s, th (called ith as

fa letter, heard in brea^A), ; and the voice letters are //, cl, b, zli (named as a letter

zhe, heard in measure), z, th (called tJie, as a letter, heard in brea^^e), v. These

make up two-thirds of the consonants in our language. There are also three

mgnasals, m, n, ng (named                           as a letter, heard in si////) ;                                                                                                                                     2 liquids, l,r;                                                                  2 consonants

formed from vowels, w (on), y {ee) ; and the aspirate, h. Of pure vowels we have

six long, ah, eh, ee, aw, oh, oo\ and six short, a, e, i, o, u (in bwt, son), 66; called,

as letters, at, et, it, of, iit, dot. These 22 consonants and 12 vowels form the alphabet

of simple sounds for the English language. It is convenient and even necessary to

have signs for the two frequent double consonants ch (called chai/ as a letter, heard

in choose, stretcA) and/ (iu_/uice, edge)                                                                                                                                                                               and for the double vowels i, oi, ou, u.

is composed of the simple letters t, sh ; and,/ of d, zh. The diphthong i is composed

of an obscure vowel rapidly pronounced (which may be represented by e or a), fol-

lowed by short ee, thus ei or ai ; oi is aw long, followed by short ee ; on is an obscure
vowel rapidly pronounced (which may be represented by o or a) followed by short.

00, thus ou or au ; and u is ee, oo, the ee being pronounced as y. There are, there-

fore, in the shorthand alphabet 12 vowels, 4 diphthongs, and 24 consonants ; total,
40 letters.

   The principles on which the right lines and curves in various positions are as-

--signed as the representatives of the consonants are these : Light strokes represent

breath letters, and heavy strokes represent voice letters. By placing the six signs

I I ( ( ) ) in four positions, we obtain 24 characters serviceable for letters, which
is the number we require. But in arranging the signs and sounds it is evident that

some accommodations must be made as to heavy and light strokes ; for six of the

consonants, m, w, ng, y, w, h, do not pair as breath letters and voice letters, as do

the others. It is a most fortunate circumstance that we can harmoniously an-ange

22 out of these 24 signs, so as to preserve a relation between the sound and the

sign.

There are two Jiinds of classes of letters, 1st, gutturals, palatals, dentals, and

labials                                 so called from the seats of articulation where they are produced                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            and 2nd,

mutes or explodents, in which the sound is completely stojjped in till it is exploded,

mpas ; nasals, in which the sound issues through the nose, as ; liquids, or melting

letters, as /, having the capacity of uniting with other letters, and producing diph-

--thongal consonants ; semi\'owels, or half vowels, y, to ; and aspirate or breathing,

h; these various classes being so called from the quality of the sound, or the place
Nowof its exit.
                                        it is evident that but one of these two kinds of classification
--organic and qualitative can be regai'ded in assigning signs to soimds ; for a given

stroke can no more be \NTitten in two positions at the same time, than a thing can

be in two places at the same time. In laying the foundation of Phonogi-aphy I

carried out au exhaustive series of experiments to ascertain which kind of strokes,

straight or curved, and what positions, would best suit the diiferent classes of let-

ters ; and I found that the best alphabet resulted from giving the straight lines to

the explodents k,                       t,  ch, p,  and the  curves to all                                                                                                                                              the other classes                                                                placing guttiu'al

On the Qiutntity mid Value of Foreign Grain imported into the United King-
   dom since the Repeal of the Corn Laws. Bt/ Frederick Purdy, F.S.S.,

Principal of the Statistical Department, Foor-Law Board.

   The author observed that the benefits which the country had already derived
from free trade were beyond the most sanguine anticipations of those who had suc-
cessfully striven to destroy the protective tariti'of England. The Custom House

returns disclose figures which, to tho?e who are not very familiar with statistical

and economic research, look like fabulous amounts. For example, in the four years

ended with 1844 (these were the last years of the celebrated and mischievous
"sliding scale") 1,791,000 quarters was the average yearly quantity of wheat im-

ported                             the price of British wheat being, in those years, 64s. id., 57s. 3cL, 50s.  If?.,
                                ;

and 51s. 3d., taking the prices chronologically. Eut, in the four years ended with

1863, the average imports were 6,970,000 quarters, at prices ranging between

44s. 9d. and 55s. 5d. The imports in quantity were, in the last four years, nearly

fourfold what we obtained in 1841-44 ; at the same time the price was much lower.
Under " grain " the author classed wheat, wheaten floiu- and meal, barley, oats, rye,

maize, peas and beans, &c. ; and it was shown, with regard to the value of these
commodities, that the whole of the imports dm-ing the decade ended with 1863
amounted to £250,202,000. Nearly all this vast quantity of grain and Hour which

this money-value represents has been consumed in this kingdom, about £3,000,000
worth only having been exported in the ten years. The annual average home con-

sumption of foreign corn, flour, and meal "for 1852-63 was 11,865,000 quarters,

valued at £25,000,000 very nearly. Three periods of four years each were then
taken to show the imports according to population.

                                   1842-45            Average annual cuautity
                                   1852-55                        per head.
                                   1860-63
                                                               0-8 of a bushel.
                                                               2-3 bushels.
                                                               4-4 bushels.

So that the quantity taken with reference to the population was precisely_/?w and
a half times greater in 1860-63 than it was eighteen years before. It was further

shovsTi that, as regards the different parts of the United Kingdom, they appeared

to participate equally in the imports of grain properly so called : but that, of flour

--and meal, Ireland received a much smaller quantity than either England or Scot-

land e. a., the following were shown to be the proportions in each division in
1861:--

                                   England and Wales  Bushels of grain  lbs. of flour and
                                                            per head.
                                   Scotland                     3-9     meal per head.

                                                                 3-9        · 286
                                                                               293

The year of maximum imports was 1862, when 18,441,000 quarters of grain, meal,

and floin of all sorts were received into the ports of the United Kingdom, valut^d
at £37,772,000. IMr. Macculloch had computed that, for hiunan food and for the
inferior animals, this country required 49,000,000 quarters of grain, flour, and meal
annually. This estimate was framed five or six years ago. Very recenth-, Mr.
Caird has computed the quantity of wheat required for the consumption of Great

Britain at 18,700,000 quarters.

   From the appendix to the paper the following figures have been abstracted, to
show the countries to which we were, at the latest date, indebted for oiu- grain

imports :

    Statistics of Crime and Criminals in E)igland. By T. W. Saunders,

                                                  Hecorder of Bath.

   The speaker called attention to the importance of the suhject and the very great

--amount of popular error entertained with reference to it so great, indeed, that the

belief was well established that, as regards crime and ciiminals, this countiy is in

a deplorable condition. He observed that to the abandonment of the practice of

transporting our worst offenders to the colonies, and the substitution of penal ser-

vitude at home, this supposed evil is universally attributed. He stated that the

facts he had to biing under consideration would, he believed, expose this en'or and
show that, with reference to crime and criminals, the country was never in a more
satisfactory condition than at the present time, lie then refen-ed to the state of
crime in the sixteenth, seventeeth, aud eighteenth centm-ies, as showing its gi-eat
prevalence, and contrasted the security of life and property in tlie present day

\%'ith the dangers which beset them in former times. He drew attention to the

establishment in 1856 of a imiform system of police throughout the whole country,
and to the fact that at the end of 1853 the first penal-servitude Act came into
operation, the effects, however, of which were not f^lt imtil the yeai- 1859; and he

dwelt upon the importance of the statistics as now furnished by the police authori-

ties to the government, and that these returns continually proved the general
decrease of crime and of the criminal classes. These returns, he said, showed that
the criminal classes at larr/e, comprising known fliieves and depredators, reccirers of
stolen goods, prostitutes, siiq)ected persons, and vagrants and tramjJS numbered as

follows in the years as under :

           1858                                 134,922
           1859                                 135,766
           1860                                 131,024
           1861                                 123,049
           1862                                 127,051
           1863                                 126,139

showing a decrease in five years of 8783 ; and that if vag?-ants and tramps were ex-

cluded, who were often honest people, and the number of whom is greatly affected

by merely temporary causes, such as the cotton famine, the numbers would be as

follows :

           1858                                 112,363

           1859                                 112,413

           1860                                 108,760

           1861                                 99,048

           1862                                 102,635

           1863                                 92,957

sho-vraig a decrease in five years of 19,406, and this, too, whilst in the same time
no less than 12,281 persons "had been released in this countiy from penal servitvide.

He proceeded to show that baud in hand with this diminution there had been a

decrease in the number of houses of had character --those the resorts of thieves and
prostitutes, the decrease since 1859 being no less than 3566, or nearly 14 per cent.

The actual diminution of crime, he remarked, had kept pace with the diminution
of the criminal classes ; and after calling attention to the fact that the police kept
a register of all crimes committed, whether or not any persons were apprehended for
them, he stated that the numbers of indictable ofiences committed in each year

since and inclusive of 1858 are as follows :

                                                                                         I

shoNving that in the last year, as compared with the year 1858 (only five years

since), there had been a decline in indictable crimes committed to the extent of

5657, or 11 per cent. He said that from these retm'us it would appear that the

year 1860 was the lowest as regards actual crimes committed, and that the year

1861 came next, the increase being, however, less than one 2)er cent, and that this in-

crease was apparent rather than real, as the population itself increases at the rate of

one and a quarter per cent, per annum. That with reference to the increase in the year
1862, such increase was to be accoimted for by certain exceptional causes. 1st, The

deplorable effects of the ci^·il war in America were first felt in Lancashire in that

year, causing an excess of crime in that county over the preceding year of 1149.

2nd, In that year the new Criminal Law Consolidation Acts came into operation;
and as these statutes enacted from twenty to thirty new indictable oflences, these

assisted to swell the excess of the year. 3. There was an excess in attempts to

commit suicide of 407, the number in 18G0 being 174, and in 1862, 581 ; but as an

attempt to commit suicide, though an indictable ofl^nce, is not considered by the

public as a crime, crimes in the sense in which they are properly understood

being those offences which are committed by one man against another, and not

against himself, and as there was no actual increase in suicides themselves, leading

to the well-founded ground that the apparent increase arose more from police in-

tervention than any actual increase itself, it would be right to exclude this increase

from the computation. Taking, therefore, the increase of crime in 1862 over 1801

to be 2820, and deducting the increase in Lancashire, and the excess of attempts

to commit suicide (saying notliing of the new indictable offences), the excess of the

year will appear to be 1264, which is a number exactly corresponding v\'ith the

rate of increase of the population.

  He proceeded to show that in the last year (186.3) there was a decrease with

reference to 1862 of 1014 crimes, though still an increase upon 1860 (the lowest

year upon record)                                                                        but that in this year,  as  in  1862, the  same  exceptionable  and
                                                                                      ;

temporary causes were in operation. Thus there was still an excess of crime in

Lancashire, though much reduced but that the excess in attempts to commit sui-
                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

cide had increased from 174 in 1860 to 686 in 1863 ; that deducting, therefore, the

excess in Lancashire and the excess in attempts to commit suicide, there would be

an excess of crimes in 1863 over 1860 of only 1080 ; but that if the increase in

crime had only kept pace with the increase of population, the increase should have

been 1890. So that comparing 1863 with 1860 (the lowest year on record for

crime), there is a relative decrease, and this, notwithstanding that diuring the last

five years more than 12,000 convicts of the worst class had been set at liberty.

  He observed that the fact that there is no real increase in crime in this country

reflects very great credit upon our systems of police and penal pimishment ; for that
had there been even a considerable increase no surprise would have been justified,

since it could hardly have been supposed that those classes of criminals who for-
merly, when their term of transportation expired, became the pest and terror of our

colonies would, merely by being kept in this country, become orderly and well-

conducted members of society. It was certainly true, he observed, that during the

last few years there had been some increase in crimes of violence against persons
and property, though even in this respect the country is better off" than it was six

years ago.

  He called attention to a common but fallacious way of viewing the question of

the increase of crime, by taking, as a proof of such increase, the increased number

of persons apprehended and committed for trial ; and he explained that, as only a
percentage of criminals are apprehended for the crimes they commit, the increased

committals may be due alone to the superior vigilance of the police ; and he stated

that whilst in i860 the apprehensions for crimes committed was 49 per cent., it gra-

dually increased to 58 per cent, in 1863, thus showing an increase of 9 per cent, in the
--174 REPORT 1864.

apprehensions in three years in respect of the sanae number of crimes. He also

observed that the percentage of commitments for trial upon apprehensions had also

--increased from 65 per cent, in 1860 to 69 per cent, in 1863 facts which show that

a great increase of criminals for trial is quite consistant with there being no actual

increase in crimes committed.

   Two facts, he remarked, testified to the efficient working of our present system

of punishments : 1st, the decreasing number of recommitments, these being
40 per cent, upon the total commitments in the year 1859, and progressively de-
clining to 371 per cent, in 1863 : 2nd, the great number of persons who had been
subjected to penal servitude who were living honest lives ; for that in February in
the last year the Government directed the police authorities throughout the
country to make a return as to the modes of life of the persons then at large, either
upon tickets-of-leave or upon the tennination of sentences of penal servitude, and
it was ascertained that there were 4379 such persons, and that of these 2025 were
living the lives of honest well-conducted men (being in fact nearly one-half), the

remainder being either doubtful or bad characters. He refen'ed, also, to the very

gratifying fact of a substantial decrease of crime amongst the juvenile population,
the decline in the number of commitments of prisoners under sixteen years of age
being one-third in seven years, the numbers in 1856 being 13,981, and in 1863

only 8459.

   He observed that we could never hope by merely penal discipline entirely to

reclaim criminals from crim(^, or prevent innocent persons from embracing it ; that
as long as poverty and ignorance exist, so long will there be destitution and its

offspring, crime ; that in this age, when science is doing so much through ma-
chinery to supersede mere manual labour, and when skilled labour is almost the
only kind of labour that is in requisition, the uneducated man is daily becoming
more and more embarrassed in his efforts to obtain a livelihood; that to the un-
educated man the lowest and commonest kinds of labour are alone open, and
when from any cause these fail he has no other resource, and want and destitution
are his lot. That this is so is proved by om- criminal returns, which show that
crimes are annually becoming more and more confined to the ignorant ; that in

the year 1856 the untaught, untrained, and unskilled to work comprised 53 per cent,

of all those who were committed for trial ; whilst in the year 1863 this percentage
had increased to 63i, or more than 10 per cent, in seven years ! That the more

clearly to show that crime is being confined to the ignorant, the returns should
be looked at as exhibiting the degrees of education amongst the criminals ; and
that, going back to the year 1856, it would be foimd that 33 per cent, of our
criminals could neither read nor write, whilst in the year 1803 this class had
increased to 35 per cent. ; that in 1856 the numbers who could merely rend, or
read and lorite imperfectUj, were 53 per cent, upon the whole, whilst in 1863 they
were 60 per cent. But that looking to the educated proportion of our criminals, the
numbers who, in 1856, could read and jvrite well were only 5i per cent., whilst in
 1863 even this small percentage had declined to 3^, the most striking fact being

that of criminals possessing superior instruction the percentage in 1856 was only

--03, which in 1863 had furtlier declined to 02.
   He concluded as follows : " Such facts as those conclusively show the tendency

 of crime to confine itself to the imtraiued and ignorant, and to leave the educated
 almost wholly free from its association. Crime and ignorance clearly go hand in

hand ; and although it by no means follows that an untaught man will become a

 criminal, instruction would appear to afford a guarantee against its possessor

becoming such. The statistics I have now brought under your attention estab-

--lish, I think, these propositions : that uotmthstanding we now keep nearly all

 our criminals in this country instead of transporting a large proportion of them to
 our colonies, the criminal classes have greatly declined in numbers, whilst crime
 itself is at as low an ebb as at any period of our history ; that our detective and
 penal machinery works well, and that crime is more and more becoming the

associate of only the untaught and ignorant. If I am correct in the facts I have

 stated and the conclusions I have drawn from them, our duty and policy alike
point out, that whilst we should not neglect by penal discipline to endeavour to
 reform the criminal, and b}' the terror of his example work healthily upon the
                                                                                 --

minds of those whose misfortune it may be to be brought within criminal in-
fluences, we should, by a judicious system of education, redouble our eflbrts to
place the humbler classes in such a position as will enable them to escape or suc-

cessfully resist all temptations to the commission of crime."

On the " Truck System" in some Parts of the West of England.
                         By Edwaed Spender.

In the West of England, especially in Devon, Somerset, Gloucestershire, and

Herefordshire, the practice prevails of pajang a proportion of the wages of the

agricultural labourer in cider. This proportion varies from 20 to 50 per cent, on

the whole. The latter large figure is attained in Herefordshire during harvest

time, when a mower or a reaper will earn Os. a week in monej' and drink nine

gallons of cider a week, cider at the time being worth Is. a gallon. In Devonshire

there does not seem to be the same excess, but the system prevails more or less.

HowThe question then arises,  far is it desirable as regards the health, and the
--morals of the labourer ? What is cider ? Is it food or poison ? Or both, or

neither ? Professor Voelcker has analyzed an imperial pint of cider drawn by

a^^ricultural labourers in Somersetshii-e, and he finds the following residts :

Water                         Cider contains parts  Bread contains parts

Flesh-forming matters                 94-21                   36
                                            -02                  8
Heat-producing ,,
General matters                          5-57             --56
                                            -20

                              10000                 100-00

Hence a man would require to drink nearly 85 gallons of cider in order to take

into the system the same amount of carbon or heat-producing constituents as is
contained in a pound of wheaten bread ; and in order to obtain the same amount

of nitrogen, or flesh-forming constituent, he would have to swallow 32 gallons of
cider. Compared with meat the difference is of course far greater. Cider can
therefore scarcely be called food. It would be going too far to call it poison when
it is pure ; but the cider drank by the lower classes is rarely pure. Experiments
have shown that, whether the cider be pm-e or not, a farm labourer will work

better on coffee or cocoa than on cider.

   On politico-economical grounds, the "cider-truck" cannot be too strongly con-

dennied. It is even more unscientific than the truck-system which prevailed in

the manufacturing and mining districts, and which was forbidden by the Act 1 & 2

Wm. IV., cap. 37. Under that system the employer did not sell his own produce

at a certain fixed sum not to be altered according to the changes in the money value
of that produce. Under the " cider-truck " the farmer gives a fixed quantity of

cider regardless of the rise and fall in the value of cider caused by the scarcity or
abundance of the apple crop. The result is, that j ust as the farmer is receiving the

least return, he is making the greatest outlay. When a poor apple crop reduces

his profits, he is paying the highest wages ; while when, on the contraiy, the apples

are abundant, and he could afford to pay his labourers highly, he is really paying

them less than usual. Supposing tlie cider to be genuine, the farmer in a bad year

may be paying wages at the rate of 18.s. per week, while in a good year he will be

paying- at the rate of 12.s. ; this fact alone is a strong inducement for the farmer to

adulterate the favourite beverage. He cannot afford to give good cider in bad times,
and having once formed the habit of adidterating, he cannot lay it aside when

there is no need to resort to it.

   Another strong objection is that while the ordinary truck allows a man a choice
in the articles he takes, the cider truck does not, but compels him to take an

Aenormous quantity of an article which he can scarcely afford to have at all.

person of the upper classes wlio spent a fifth of his income, still more one-half, on
his cellar would run the risk of an inquiry into his sanity by the Lunacy Commis-
sioners. Yet not only is nothing said against the extravagance of the labourer,
but he is actually forced to commit it. It has been urged in behalf of the system,
that it prevents the labourer from resorting to the drink-shop. It is of small ad-
--176 REPORT 1864.

vantage to tlie labourer to be drenched, nolens volens, by his master instead of at

his own option by the publican. As a matter of fact, cider-shops abound in the
cider counties, and are frequented by agricultural labourers, who resort thither for

companionship, and, as a matter of course, drink " for the good of the house."
   Tlie great difficulty in remedying this evil lies in the opposition to a remedy on

the part of those who suffer for want of it. It is one of the worst features of the

cider truck that it enforces selfishness. A. young newly married labourer will take
home his earnings to his wife, and would prefer that the whole of them should bo
paid in money. The elder labourer approves of the " cider truck," and would
oppose any alteration of it. Tlius in proportion as there is a greater need of thrift
does thriftlessness increase just as the labourer becomes the father of a family,

                                                                                                                                                   ;

and there are more mouths to feed, does he take home less money to feed them
with. Botli parties are wedded to the system, and reform is thereby rendered
very difficult. Some influential agriculturists in Somersetshire have substituted
money for cider, and have found that, when fairly carried out, the change has been

approved by the labourer. An agreement may be difficult at the onset, but, when

once made, it will be permanent, whereas the present disputes about quality and
quantity are perennial. The extension of the Truck Act to the agricultural dis-

tricts is therefore much to be desired, and seems to be the only efficient remedy for

the manifold evils of the "cider-truck."

                      The Sanitanj Statistics of Clifton.

               By J. A. Symonds, M.D., F.KS.K, 4'c., 6(c.

This paper proved the importance of adding verbal explanations to statistical

figures. The Registrar-General's report had given 24 in 1000 as the death-rate of

Clifton, calculated from the deaths in the quarter ending June 1864. This state-

ment would be very injurious to the reputation of Clifton as a watering-place,

imless it were explained that its name is g·i^eu to a large Poor-law district, to the

population of which Clifton proper contributes little more than one-fifth. The

several subdistricts of Clifton Union were described in detail as to their sanitary

characteristics, and as to their respective death-rates, calculated from the annual

returns of death in the five j-ears from 1859 to 1864. The average for Clifton proper

is 17 in 1000; and if a quarterly return be a fair basis of calculation, it would be found

that in some quarters the death-rate amounted to only 15 in 1000. On comparing

the death-rates of the several subdistricts of Clifton Union, the author showed

the influence of urban and rural agencies. The highest death-rates denote the

combination of poverty and crowding. He compared the death-rates of several

localities in England, and ascertained that the average for a crowded town was 24

in 1000, for a rural district 15, and for a mixed district 21. Clifton Union is a

mixed district. One of its subdistricts, three miles distant from Clifton proper,

sion of a strong wish that the classification of numerical returns representing the

elements of the social life of our people should not be compelled to follow Poor-

law lines and limitations, which, however suitable to Poor-law pui-poses, may

cause figures to express something very diflerent from what would be their mean-

requirements, rather than with the convenience of a special branch of national

administration. Then the numerical death-rate of a crowded city would express

the mortality in that city, including items that are now transfen-ed to a rural dis-

trict, or appended to a healthy watering-place. The numerical death-rate of a

village would mean the mortality of that village, unswollen by the deaths in a

city poor-house and the numerical death-rate of a watering-place would express
                                                                                       ;

the mortality in that watering-place simply, neither complicated with the mor-

tality of distant rural retreats nor burtheued with that of the sickly suburbs of a

crowded city.

After noticing the imperfect manner in which the registers of the mortality of

Paris were kept, in consequence of the superficial mode in which the examination

into the causes of death were made by the agents charged with the duty of ascer-

taining them, Mr. Tite took occasion to praise the returns that were issued by the

care of the English Registrar-General. The imperfect character of the Paris re-

turns, and their only appearing at the period of two years after the events they

and Paris rates of mortality, I do not pretend to give them with all the accuracy

that ought to prevail in such important documents. For the Paris myrates, in

judgment, can only be regarded as close approximations."

    Mr. Tite then proceeded to notice the various causes which, in his opinion,

ought to render residence in Paris more favourable to human life than that in
London. He dwelt upon the superior quality of the soil, the kinds of food that

are consumed, the class of materials that are used in house-building, the climate,
&c., all of which are superior in Paris to those which are to be met with in
London. Yet, with all these advantages, the mortality of Paris is greater than

that of London ; for we find, from the " Statistique Ge'nerale de la France " and

in the weekly returns issued by the Registrar-General, that the mortality of the

two cities may be represented by the following figm-es :

It is, moreover, to be obseiTed that the increased mortality of Paris is accom-

Jianied by a diminished proportion of births to deaths in that city compared with

jondon                               and  that,  therefore,  this  statement                    cannot  be  assumed to give a correct

view of the mortality prevailing there. Thus, if the years 1860, 1861, and 1862

be taken as giving the average retui-n (and those years are expressly selected as

being the most favourable), we find that the proportion of births to deaths in the

two cities was

upon a gross population that was estimated at 1,696,141 in Paris, and 2,859,778

Paris                         and    every one   knows that the    rate  at which children die is gi-eater than in

the subsequent periods of life. The comparison is therefore the more unfair to

London: there were more children born there; consequently there were more

deaths among that class of the population.

It was shown that the same tendency existed in the one city as in the other to

1864.                                                                                                                               X2

resort to the cui'ative means aflbrded by the hospitals ; but Mr. Tite called attention

to the fact, that the children of the Parisians were habitually sent away from home,

and thus tended to diminish the rate of mortality in the city ; whilst the children of

Londoners were kept at home to live or to die, as the case might be. The deaths

that were registered in the Paris hospitals were, however, more than those which

took place in the hospitals of London, not only comparatively, but positively ; and
attention was called to the fact that, out of the total number of births in the year

1862, as many as 6522 out of 52,.312 took place in the public hospitals of Paris.
The eliect of the greater facilities that were thus given to the indulgence of the
passions, by the assistance that was offered to the confinement of women in that

city,  was  also  alluded to                                          and the increased  mortality that was created was made
                                                                   ;

the subj ect of some remark.

Mr. Tite thought that much of the increased mortality that he showed to pre-

vail in Paris over London was to be attributed to the overcrowding that was

obsei-vable in the former city ; to the bad hygienic conditions of the houses, as far

as regarded their ventilation, the removal oi the refuse, and the water-supply ; and

to the bad laying-out of the town generally. It appeared that in Paris as many as

35'17 persons lived imder the same roof, whereas in London the average number

was only 7'72 ; and everything that was going on in the former city tended to
increase the proportion of the inhabitants to the house-room. As to the hygienic

conditions of the houses, Mr. Tite observed that it was by no means rare to find

that the houses in the best quarters of Paris were erected with a fi-ont building

towards the street of 14 metres high, which was only separated from a back build-

ing by a court-yard of 6 metres wide, and the air of the inhabitants of the latter

was forced to be renewed in this well. The habits of the best classes were, more-

over, such as to render this inconvenience from the want of ventilation more

injurious; and "the villainous smells" that could be distinctly perceived in all

parts of the city were attributed to the deficient notions that prevailed in this respect,

and to the deficient manner in which the service of the town was performed in

respect to the removal of the house-refuse. The streets of Paris were also very
badly planned ; and though much had been done to improve the state of things thus
pointed out of late, yet much remained to be done before Paris could compare

with London in this respect. The streets in the former city were crooked, narrow,
and confined, and the circulation of air in them was very much impeded. Mr.

Tite thought that, in fact, the number of people that crowded together imder the

same roof, and the bad state of the houses themselves, were the main causes of the

increased rate of mortality observable in Paris.

The state of the sewerage and the water-supply of Paris were also said to be

very deficient. Thus, it was calculated that there were above 700 kilometres of

streets in Paris, but there was not half that length of streets sewered ; and in
Paris the sewers had very different functions to perform than they had in London,

as they were designed to carry off from the former city only the rain-water and

some portion of the liquid sewage, whereas, in the latter, they conveyed away

from the householder all the house-refuse and the rain-water indiscriminately.

There had been executed a well-devised scheme for discharging the sewage on the

northern side of the Seine, which conducted the waters to the neighbourhood of

Asnieres ; but this did not deal with the sewerage of the islands, nor did it relieve

the river from the impurities that it received from the sewerage of the south side,

which, in fact, was poured into the Seine just above the intake of the water-works

of Chaillot. The error that the French engineers had committed in designing

their system of sewers was in limiting them to the fimctions of drains, instead of

making them serve both as drains and sewers. As to the water-works in Paris,

their insufficiency was proved by the fact that there were only about 25,000 sub-

scribers out of 50,000 householders ; and by the fact that the water was, in the
majority of cases, only delivered on the level of the ground floor. The peculiar

tenm'e of the French houses, indeed, opposed the introduction of the water to the
various flats, or stories, that are let out to distinct and separate families. The sup-
ply of water in Paris was at present imdergoing a radical change, but it was still

very much behind the system that prevailed in London.

But, with all the causes that give rise to the increased mortality of Pai-is over
                                                                           --

 London, it is not the less certain that of late the proportion of the excess had
 tended to decrease, in consequence of the works that had been executed for the

better organization of the sewerage, the water-supply, the street-ventilation, and
the reform of the house-system under the orders of the Emperor. The inquiry into

the rates of mortality has, however, thus far led to ascertaining the fact that the

mortality of London is less that that of Paris by nearly 4 in 1000, if the average
be taken over a period of ten years ; it is less by nearly 13 in 10,000, if attention
is solelj' confined to the rate of mortality which prevailed in the year 1862.

    After stating that he had followed, in the statistics given in the paper thus read,
the " Statistique Generale de la France" and the " .\unuau-e du Bureau des Lon-
gitudes " for all that had reference to the mortality of Paris, and the returns of the
Registrar-General for that of London, Mr. Tite concluded by adopting the state-
ment that had been made upon the subject by M. Legoyt. That gentleman, Mr.
Tite said, stated that, ''firstly, Paris had more marriages, and of legitimate chil-
dren less than London ; secondly, that in spite of this lesser fecundity, and the
well-known fact that a gTeat number of the children born in Paris died in the
country, Paris had a rate of mortality that was much greater than that of Lon-
don thirdly, that there was a greater proportion of male deaths in London than

                       ;

in Paris fourthly, that the proportion of births to deaths was greater in London
                                              ;

than Paris." It must have cost the national vanity of M. Legoyt a great deal to

make these admissions, and they may very fairly be taken as representing the facts

of the case.

On the Land-Transfer of Australia as applicable to Ireland.

                                                                           will

now consider the different methods prescribed for conducting the futiu'e transfers

and other dealings with land, through the institimentality of ' Registration of

Title ' ; without again accumulating the complexities and doubts of retrospective
title fi-om which they have been cleared by the procedure just described under the

Australian method, which is that adopted in the Bill of the Irish Association, the

Record Book is the pivot upon which the whole mechanism tm-ns. It is compiled

by binding together the duplicates of all conveyances and declarations of titles

issued by the Estates Coin-t representing the freehold, each of which constitutes a

distinct folium, consisting of two or more pages set apart for recording together the

memorials of all futm'e dealings, whether with the freehold or any lesser estate or in-

terest in the land represented by the conveyance or declaration of title, imtil a change

Whenof ownership of the freehold is registered.  this occurs, the existing declaration

of title or conveyance is cancelled, the exising folium of the record closed, afresh de-

claration of title issued to the new proprietor, and a new folium opened in the Record

Book, upon which are carried forward the memorials of all lesser estates and

charges affecting the land, and continuing current at the time of recording the

ownership of the freehold. Printed forms of contract, with full instructions for

the guidance of parties dealing, are to be supplied at the lands'-titles office and

law-stationers' shops. These instmments must be filled in duplicate. All cove-

nants essential to the existence, use, and enjojTnent of estates and interests which

are the subject of the contract are declared to be implied in these instniments
                                                                                                                                                                                                                             f

and, when recorded, they are endorsed with the folium of the record constituted

by the declaration of title of the land, where the memorials of them will be found

entered in the order in which they are recorded. They are then numbered in con-

secutive series ; one original of each is handed to the party whose title is evinced
thereby, the other is filed in the lands'-titles office. Under this method accumula-

tion of instruments with voluminous indexes, the fatal objection to other systems,

is avoided. The retrospective character of title is effectually got rid of, as each

     Stxtistics of Crime in Australia. By AV. WE5TG.vnTH (of Australia).

   Crime in Australia, a? compared with England, is much greater, owing to the

effects of transportation upon the colony. Thefavourable condition, however, of South

Australia, New Zealand, and particularly Queen's To^^^l, leads them to hope that the

entire group would, but for that cause, have compared favourably with the mother
country. In Victoria the cost of police and prisoners for 18G0 amounted to 15s.
per head of the population, that for England and Wales being only 2s. Ud. In

New South Wales the yearly average of the five years 1858-62 gives 1 criminal

in 433 ; and, in Victoria, for 1859-61, the still worse result of 1 in 375. The
colonies present considerable diversities with regard to crime, which are to be
attributed chieflv to the transportation system. Tliere was no feature of these

colonies more satisfactory than their progressive social improvement, as instanced

by the j-early diminution of crime there.

Rer/istration of Births and Deaths in Ireland. Bi/ J. "Wilsox.

In accordance with the provisions of the Act of last year, the 16-3 poor-law

xmions and 718 dispensary districts have been adopted as areas for the registration

of births and deaths. During the first quarter tliere were registered 30,330 births,

affording an annual ratio of 1 in 4S of the inhabitants ; the number of deaths was

28,540, lieing  equal  to  an  annual  mortality  of  1  in  51  of  the  population.                                                     The

--annual' birth-rate varied in the provinces as follows : In Leinster it was 1 in 49

in Munster, 1 in 41 ; in Ulster, 1 in 52 ; and in Connaught, 1 in 54. The death-

rate was, in Leinster, 1 in 46 ; in Munster, 1 in 51; in Ulster, 1 in 50; and in

Counau'^ht, 1 in 65. The return shows that, during the three months ended 30th

June last, the births registered amounted to 38,701, affording an annual ratio of 1

in 37, which was an increase of 8371 on the number of the previous quarter ; the

deaths amounted to 24,448, being equal to an annual ratio of 1 in 59, and was a

decrease of 4092 when compared with the previous quarter. The annual birth-

--rate during that quarter varied in the provinces thus : In Leinster it was 1 in

--38 ; in Munster, 1 in 34 ; in Ulster, 1 in 38 ; and in Connaught, 1 in 41. The

death-rate was as follows : In Leinster, 1 in 55 ; in Munster, 1 in 60 ; in Ulster,

1 in 57 ; and in Connaught, 1 in 77.

       Saiiitari/ Statistics of Cheltenham. Bij Dr. Edwaed Wilson, M.A.

   After a description of the geology, mineral springs, and climate of Cheltenham,
the author stated that in 1852 the Local Improvement act was passed, empowering
the Commissioners to purchase then existing sewers, and to extend the system
wherever needed, requiring moreover that tanks should be constructed communi-
cating with mains into which the whole of the sewerage of the town was to be

conducted.

   Under these powers the rights of the Sewer's Company passed iato the hands
of the Commissioners in 1857, and large additions have been made to the sewers

in the denser parts of the town ; but the greater portion of the three large estates
of Bays Hill, Lansdowne, and Pitt^-ilie, occupied by the better classes' of houses, is
still p'ractically beyond the super\ision of the local authorities, being dependent on
private sources for sewerage ; and though the sewers on these estates are assumed
by the Commissioners to be adequate to the requirements of the people, it is obvious
that where there is no power of inspection except on presentment of nuisance there
can be no adequate oifieial knowledge. Whilst, therefore, all credit is due to the
Commissioners for what has been done, it would be unwise to ignore the conclusion

that the present system of divided responsibility affords no adequate guarantee for
                                                                                 ;

            TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                          181

the efficient drainage of the whole to-n-n, and that an act of Parliament rendering

the purchase of private sewers not only permissive but compulsory on the Com-

missioners would remove an existing anomaly, and be to the eventual benefit of lie

town at large. In the tanks to v^hich the sewerage is now conducted the solids
are separated and mixed with town ashes to form manure, while the liquid portiors

are passed, after very partial deodorization, into the streams, which are rendered
excessively foul by the subsequent decomposition of the filth.

   The streams within the town are thus kept comparatively pm-e, but the mills
on the Chelt render its streams intermittent, and interfere with the scour in its

channel.

    The water supply is derived in part from the sandbed on which the town is built,
in part from the rainfall of the hills. That from the sandbed is usually preferred

for drinking purposes, but it is extremely hard, containing 36 to 80 grs. per gallon.
That from the hills contains 11 to 12 gi-s. per gallon.

    The first act for bringing hill water to the town was obtained by the water
company in 1824. In 1849 the amount supplied was 72i gals, per house daily

at the present time all information is denied by the company, but it is hoped tlut
their enero:etic measures, combined with the anxiety of the Town's Commissioners

on the subject, may result in an additional supply of wholesome water, sufficient

not only for household pui-poses, but for public washhouses and baths, which are
justly considered at the present day as among the most essential of sanitary re-

quirements.

  --The population of Cheltenham in 1861 was 36,693 males being to females as
--100 to 138 the proportion for England and Wales being 100 to 105. The growth

of the town is still double the natural increase due to excess of births over deaths
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

and greater than that of the inland watering places generally, in the ratio of 13-24
to 7'28 per cent. The social conditions of Cheltenham are peculiar, and affect in
a remarkable manner the census returns for certain periods of life. The tables
produced showed the large accession to the population during the school period,
between the ages of 10 and 20 ; whilst the absence of anj^ large manufacturing or
commercial industries in the town, and the consequent departure of the boys on
leading school, will account in part for the enormous preponderance of females
(190 to 100 males) between the ages of 20 or 30 : other causes doubtless contribute
to this result, but that they are acting chietiy among the higher classes is evident
from the fact that in St. Peter's eccle.siastical district, which is occupied by the
very poor, the males in 1861 were actually in excess of the females. During the
later periods of life numbers flock to the town in search of health and the social
advantages for which it has acquired a reputation ; and it is no easj-task to balance

--accurately the effects of these two sources of addition to the population from with-

out one tending materially to decrease, the other to augment the liability to
disease and death. The proximity of great wealth to great poverty is nowhere so
marked as in a watering place, and Cheltenham is no exception to the rule. The
absence of any large manufacturing industry, and the dependence of the poorer
classes on the capricious expenditure of their richer neighbours, cannot fail to cause
fluctuations in the labour market most injurious to the independence and self-
reliance of the working classes. In Cheltenham this is strongly felt, and the large

extent of pauperism existing may in part be due to this cause. The great wealth

and pecidiar nature of the occupations in Cheltenham is seen from the fact, that

On turning from these evidences of wealth and luxury, it seems strange to find the

amount per head spent on the poor of the Cheltenham Union increasing, and per-
sistently in excess of the average for the kingdom at large. One reason has been

already suggested ; others might probably be found in the enormous charities of
the place and the lapse of the Mendicity Society, which formed one of the most
eifectual checks on mendicancy and imposture. The mean number of paupers per

cent, for the year ending Lady Day was :

The increase in pauperism bears no proportion to the increase of the population,
and it is probably, to a great extent, independent of this cause. The various medi-
cal charities, including the General Ilosi^ital and Dispensary, the Coburg Institution,
the Ophthalmic Infirmary, and L'nion Workhouse, were treated of at some length,
and the need of some special provision in connexion with the Hospital for the
treatment of infectious cases was strongly urged. These cases are now treated from
the out-patient department at their own miserable homes, devoid most frequently
of the commonest necessaries of life, and likely to become foci for the spread of
disease and death. The various church charities were also passed in review, so
far as information concerning them could be obtained ; and amongst these a school
for instruction in household duties, instituted by the Rector, was regarded as the
germ of a better and more organized system for the relief of the sick poor in the

town. By the two-fold workiugs of this institution the girls are, on the one hand,

educated in household duties and trained to thrift and tidiness; whilst, on the
other, the produce of the kitchen, which represents the alms of the congregation, is

distributed to the sick and aged poor through district \'isitors appointed for the
purpose. Means were suggested for extending the systfem to other chiu'ch districts,
and so organizing the whole as to direct the streams of charity more exclusively to
the sick and disabled, and it was expected that the period of convalescence might
thus be materially shortened to working men, and the continual di-ain upon the

vatepavers, from this source at least, be perceptibly diminished. Several tables
were drawn iip to show the prevalent diseases and most frequent causes of death
in the district ; a few extracts only can be given. It must first be premised, how-
ever, that Cheltenham, in the Registrar General's Returns, and the Cheltenham
of ordinary conversation are two entirely different quantities. The former being
the town or borough, with a population of 39,693, in 1861, on an area of 3,740
acres, plus the twelve surrounding parishes of Swindon, Prestbury, Charlton
Kings, Leckhampton, Cubberly, Cowley, AiNTiitcombe, Badgworth, Shurdington,

Up Hatherly, and Staverton, containing together in 1861 a population of 10,099,

on an area of 21,136 acres. The returns therefore obtained from the whole district

cannot be held to represent the state of one portion to the exclusion of the rest

without the corrections afforded by an appeal to local records. It is strange, then,
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                  183

that difficulties and serious expense should be made to attend any such inquiiT,

and that in the absence of any reliable information on the part of the Registrar-

General, and on the part of the local authorities in om' large towns, as to the sani-

tary condition of those towns, no effort should be made to facilitate the examination

of the documents which can alone, under the present system, give the most essen-

tial information. The death-rate in the parish of Cheltenham varies in a most

remarkable manner, from as high as 22-2 to the low figure of 15-6 ; the average for

ten years being 19-29, which, if the deaths in the General Hospital and Union

Workhouse be excluded, gives a result very slightly in excess of the standard nor-

thern districts as determined by Dr. Greenhow. In 1840-41-42 the death-rate

for the district was 23 in the 1000, a figure which has not been reached since the

improved drainage has been carried out in the town. Cheltenham has always

enjoyed a remai'kable immimity from zymotic disease. Deaths fi-om small-pox,

scarlatina, measles, typhus, diarrhoea, dysentery, and cholera are much below the

average for the kingdom, and these are the diseases which are now usually held as

tests of the sanitary condition of a town. There are stiU deaths from small-pox,

however, in sufficient mmibers to make it a formidable foe, and to convict a people

of culpable neglect. For though the deaths from this disease daring the ten years

1850-1861 were in Cheltenham district only 92 in 10,000 living under five years of

age, whilst in England and Wales there were 103, it must not be forgotten that

in 44 registration districts there were no deaths from this cause under five years,

and that in 279 disti-icts the deaths were under 50. Of the deaths from all causes

in the Cheltenham district, no less than one-fifth occur in children under one year

of age, and nearly one-third in children who have just completed their fifth year.

This mortality would seem to be due, in part, to ignorance and neglect on the part

of the mothers ; but that it also depends on inherited weakness, poverty, and mal-

nutrition appears plain from the excessive number of deaths at early ages due to

tabes mesenterica and brain-disease, including hydrocephalus. In diseases of the

respiratoiy organs, including phthisis, the Cheltenham district shows a favourable

--comparison with the averages for the whole kingdom for Gloucester and for
--Clifton a result which could scarcely be expected when the number of invalids

frequenting the town is taken into consideration. Rheumatism is prevalent in the

district, especially in villages round the town lying on the undrained clay, and its

effects are visible in the excessive number of deaths from diseases of the heart and

--dropsy. Diseases of the brain, including hydrocephalus, are also prevalent between

the ages of 35 and 55 a curious circumstance, and not admitting of ready expla-

nation in the general absence of occupations calculated to lay special stress on the

nervous centres. The condition of the town then is, on the whole, satisfactory, and

on a consideration of its physical and social advantages, there is no prima facie

reason why it should have a death-rate higher than the healthiest town in the

kingdom. The improvements afready accomplished should be but an earnest of

--the efforts to follow. There can be no stagnation to stand still is to go back-

wards. No effort should be spared as long as there is a single preventable death
Wein the community.
                     might then venture to dream of the sanitary Utopia of

the Registrar-General, and to expect " that the tide of health-seekers may again

be turned to our shores, and our justly celebrated watering places may hold out

sanitary inducements such as shall attract even the foreigner to our shores."

up works for the manufacture of steel with machinery, which is intended to surpass

On tJie Poiuer required to overcome tJie Vis Inertice of Railway Trains, with

    a Description of a Machine to propel Trains between Stations at frequent

   Intervals withont Locomotives. Bj Peter W. Barlow, C.E., F.R.S., F.6.S.

   The attention of the author was first directed to this subject on the opening of
the North Kent Railway, in 1850, when the loconrotive engineer reported that a
much larger consumption of coke ensued than on the main line of the South-eastern
Railway with similar trains. Upon iu^-estigation of the cause of this diflference,
by experiments on the atmospheric railway and on locomotive trains, it became
apparent that the increase arose from the power required to overcome the vis inertice
of trains, more frequently occun-ing from the greater number of stations. The
remedy then applied by his advice was locomotives of more tractive power, thus,
however, adding to the weight of the engine and to destruction of the permanent
way. The tractive power has been gradually increased with increased traffic to
such an extent that in some instances tlie author recently observed that a speed of
twenty miles is now frequently reached before the last carriage leaves the platform
a speed which would cany the train above half a mile by its own momentum or
vis viva ; and it then occurred to him tliat if by a local tractive power, applied

during the length of the platform, a velocity of thirty- four or thirty-five miles
could be given, railways ha^'ing frequent stations could he worked by stationary
power, at a small comparative cost, and the e^ils of locomotives (particularly in

underground railways) could be avoided. The author explained, by experiments,
that the economy of stationary power arose not only from its usual economy over
locomotives, but that, by the law of accelerating forces, a train that wo\dd be pro-
pelled at a given velocity for a given distance would be propelled at a much greater
velocity by four times the power applied one-fourth of the distance. The pro-
pelling power suggested to be employed is that on Mr. Armstrong's hydraulic
principle ; and the author estimates that a tractive force of 8 tons (equal to that
of three locomotives) applied for 300 feet at a station will propel a train of 60 tons
for one mile at gi-eater velocity than if one locomotive worked the whole distance.
It was also explained that such mode of applying stationarj' power would not
interfere with the use of locomotives for special purposes ; and that although sucli
propellers as the author advocated were especially adapted to lines having frequent
trains, yet they would be very valuable on railways generally, particulaiiy at sta-
tions at the foot of inclines, where at present much time is frequently lost in getting

hea'S'y trains into motion.

                   On Improvements in the Defence of Ships of War.

                              By Admiral Sir E. Belchek.

   The author proposes to construct the ship on the customaiy plan of close iron
ribs, but filling up the interstices between the iron with condensed teak. Con-
strucling a vessel with 3G inches' depth of rib, at the vulnerable portions to which

shot can reach, which vnW probably involve 12 vertical feet of her side, say 8 feet
below water and 4 feet above, we should then have a vessel of stronger framework
than any now built, building, or contemplated. In lieu of teak the author
suggested paper or millboard as very efficacious, having been witness at Algiers,
in 1816, to a case in which a ream of foolscap paper, end on, resisted a 68-pound

shot. It is of the first importance to provide such a tonnage as shall, in the case
of ships of the ' Warrior ' class, be capable of floating the contemplated armament,

independent of the forward and after compartments. The first object will be the
fortification of the sides, or contour of the oval form of batteiy up to the lines of
rolling, by such a disposition of iron framing as may eftectually withstand the

hea^dest missile discharged from the heaviest gim afloat with impunity.

On the New Elevator Gim. By Edwaed Chaeleswoeth.

On Steam Boilers. By Zeeah Colbtten'.

The paper pointed out the causes of failure and bursting, and showed the value

of cast iron as a material for the purpose, and that small cast-iron spheres do not

retain the solid matter deposited from the water. Small water-tubes and small

water-spaces in ordinary boilers always choke with deposit when the feed-water

contains lime; but cast-iron boiler spheres, although they may be temporarily

coated internally with scale, are found to part with this whenever they <are_ emptied

of water. This fact is the most striking discovery that has been made in boiler

engineering. It removes the fatal defect of small subdivided water-spaces, which

can now be employed with the certainty of their remaining constantly clear of

deposit. Cast-iron boilers on this principle, invented by Mr. Harrison of Phila-

delphia, are now working in several of the midland and northern counties. Mr.

Harrison employs any required number of cast-iron hollow spheres, eight inches in

external diameter and three-eighths of an inch thick, communicating with each

Aother through open necks and held togetlier by through tie-bolts.  number of

these spheres are arranged in the form of a rectangular slab, which is so set <as to

seciire a complete circulation of the water, and several of these slabs, set side by

side and connected together, form the boiler ; about two-thirds of the whole number
of spheres being filled with water, while the remainder serve as steam-room. The

bursting strength of these spheres con-esponds to a pressure of upwards of 1-500 lbs.

--per square inch, as verified by repeated experiment between six and seven times

greater than that of the ordinary Lancashire boilers of large size. The self-acting

scaling action, which has been found to be the same in all cases where the boiler

has been worked, has been explained by conjecture. It deserves the careful in-

vestigation of the chemist and mechanical philosopher, -with whom the author pre-

fers to leave the subject.

On the Torpedoes used by the Confederate States in the Destrtwtion of some of
   the Federal Ship>s of War, and the Mode of attaching them to the Hams.

   By Captain Dott, Confederate States^ Navy. Communicated by Admiral

    Sir E. Belchee.

   The torpedo consists of a shell filled with explosive material, whether gunpowder
or gun-cotton, and is canied under the surface of the water at the end of a bar
attached to the stem of the ram or other vessel, projecting some ten or twelve feet.
The bar has a slight sliding motion, by means of which the end of the bar within
the vessel, as soon as the torpedo strikes the enemy's ship, acts on a simple me-

chanical arrangement, bringing the wires connected with the torpedo into circuit

with a galvanic batterj^, and causing the explosion of the shell. Some small
wooden steamers, with such an engine of war attached, attacked the Federal
                                                                                    ;

frigates 'New Ironsides ' and 'Minnesota/ and so much damaged them by the ex-

plosion as to render them unfit for further effective service till docked for repairs.
It was also employed in like manner against the new sloop-of-war 'Housatonic,'

attached to the Federal blockading squadron off" Charleston, which ship filled and

went down in eight minutes after the explosion of the torpedo under her counter.

It is unhesitatingly asserted by competent judges that a vessel properly constructed

for the use and application of the torpedo battery, and possessing superiority of

speed, would prove a formidable antagonist against a number of frigates armed with

the heaviest metal ; for it would, by advancing end on, present the least surface to

their fire, and always under the most acute angles. An especial advantage which

--it possesses is that it may be worked at all times for instance, in a rough sea,
--when ordinary guns could not be used while it may be employed with certain

success, under cover of darkness, against an enemy's fleet, destroying, disabling, or

driving them away from the coast altogether. Great economy, simplicity, and

safety are, further, among the valuable and important qualities claimed for this
submarine battery. Neither the battery itself nor the men working it are in the
least exposed, the apparatus being situated much below the line of flotation.

Admiral Belcher proceeded to point out the superiority of such an engine of war-
Afare over rams.
                  ram with a velocity of ten knots overhauls and touches the

stern of the vessel she chases which is going at the rate of nine and a half knots

a half-knot velocity would not injure her opponent, although it might impair her

steerage, and bring her broadside to operate on her, in all probability at such close

quarters, to her detriment. But a ram fitted with the )neans of projecting a simple

shell under the comiter, or into contact with the screw, would mevitably destroy,
or at least so derange, rudder and screw that her great work of executing the ram

manoeuvre at right angles to her antagonist would no longer be matter of doubt,

and surrender would, under such difficulty, doubtless result. The French and
other foreign governments have approved of the plans of Captain Doty. Our own

government ordered the examination of them by a scientific committee, and it has

expressed approbation in an official commimication.

              On Su{/fjested Imjproveinents in Doors. By Gr. Fawctjs.

  Many serious accidents happen to children by their hands and feet getting into

the openings at the backs of doors. Other persons sometimes are hurt by the shut-

tino- of the doors of railway-carriages. It is now proposed to remove the possibility

of this kind of accident by a difl'erent plan of hanging the doors, the back of the
door being made semicircular and to revolve in a groove of the same curvature,

presenting no opening in whatever position the door may be.

         On Chain-cable and Anchor Testing. By R, A. Peacock, C.E.

   1. To adjust the weights of the hydrostatic press, the author recommends an

instrument like a pair of pincers, 10 inches long from the pivot to the ends of the

long legs, and 1 inch from the pivot to the shorter ends ; and, gTasping- the
diameter of the indicator valve with the shorter ends, its amoiint will be rend off,
magnified tenfold, at the long ends with a scale and vernier, and there need be no

error exceeding ^^' ^^ th of an inch. Allowance should also be made for the friction
of the ram in the cylinder. Or, otherwise, provide a suitably strong coiled steel
spring with frame, nearly like a Salter's letter-balance, and graduate it up to

5 tons with actual tons of pig iron, then, on lajdng it on the platform in connexion

with the press, it will be known when the press is exei-tiug a force of 1, 2, 3, &c.

tons respectively, and the weights can be adjusted accordingly. Great weights will

be multiples of small ones.
   2. Nine different sizes of stud-link cables were tested at Woolwich, and 15'9 tons

per square inch was their average strength. But the average streng-th of ordi-
nary English iron is 25 tons ; so there is a loss of more than one-third of the

strength by making it into cables, which it is desirable to recover if possible. And

since there is tension on the exterior half and compression on the interior half of
the link, he proposes to heat the cables to cherry red before testing, which would

enable the particles to adjust themselves according to their respective tendencies

and take off the strain. And perhaps an advantage would be gained by cooling
them in oil. This annealing would probably make iron, of the same size, materials,

and make, homogeneous ; so that the degree of permanent elongation with the
Admiralty strain could be taken as a test of strength.

   3. He objects to the hammer test, because no two men vsdll strike blows of the
same force, and consequently no one can know the amount of that force. If any

blows are to be applied, he proposes to have a number of weights, each one as heavy
as a fathom of a different size of cable, and to let the proper one drop upon its cable
from one and the same height.

   4. He proposes to break one or more samples of each cable, and to state the

breaking force, or forces, on the certificates.

   5. An anchor is condemned when the testing strain causes a pennanent deflexion

of the arm of f inch by one set of rules and f inch by another set, without

anv reference to the length of the arm. He proposes instead to condemn all

anchors of which the permanent deflexion exceeds a certain fixed amount per foot

in length of the arm.

   6. Too much permanent set being justly considered fatal to the character of
a wrought-iron anchor, too much permanent set ought also to be fatal to the

character of a wrought-iron cable.

     On the Construction of Shot-proof Targets. By T. Symes Peideattx.

   According to the author's views, an armour-protected structure should consist

--of two essentially distinct parts, a yielding face and a supporting back the first,

a series of detached targets so fixed as to be capable of receding a certain distance
upon the impact of the projectile; the second, an inner self-supporting structure,
continuous throughout, and strong enough to sustain the weight and strain of the
detached targets suspended from it, and also to resist their pressm-e or support their

impact when receding before the blow of a projectile.

                                On some of the Strains of Ships.

         By Professor W. J. Maccitjoen Rankine, C.E., LL.D., F.B.S.

   In previous scientific investigations respecting the strains which ships have to
bear it has been usual to suppose the ship balanced on a point of rock, or supported
at the ends on two rocks. The strains which woidd thus be produced are far more
severe than any which have to be borne by a ship afloat. The author computes
the most severe straining actions which can take place in a ship afloat, viz. when
she is supported amidships on a wave-crest and di-y at the ends ; and he finds that
the bending action cannot exceed that due to the weight of the ship, with a lever-
----                                                                          --

age of 0'5 of her length, and that the racking action cannot exceed '16 of her
weight. Applying those results to two remarlvabh^ good examples of ships of 2080
tons displacement, one of iron and tlie other of wood, described by Mr. John Vernon
in a paper read at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1863, he finds the fol-
lowing values of the greatest stress of different kinds exerted on the materials of
the ship :

In the ii'on shi^), tension  3-92 tons per square inch.

       ,, ,, thrust          2-35   ,,  ,,
       ,, ,, racking stress         ,,  ,,
                             1-4-4

It follows that, in the iron ship, the factor of safety against bending is between five
and six, agreeing exactly with the best practice of engineers, and that there is a
great surplus of strength against racking :

In the wooden ship, tension  0'371 tons per square inch.

,, ,, thrust                 0-239  ,,  ,,

Here the factors of safety are between ten and fifteen, which also agrees with good

practice in carpentry. As for the racking action, the iron diagonal braces required

by Lloyd's Rules would be sufficient to bear one-fifth of it only, leaving the rest

to be borne by the friction and adhesion at the seams of the planking.

                                       On Units of Measure.
                Bij W. J. MAcairoEN Eankine, C.E., LL.D., F.R.S.

   Professor Rankine, one of tlie Committee, dissented from that part of the Report
which recommended the abandonment of the British units of measure, and read a
paper, in which he arrived at the conclusion that while the advantages of decimal
mid'tiplication and division as applied to units of measure are incontestable, the
question between different units, sucli as the metre and the inch, is one of conve-
nience, in which the interests of science and of trade cannot be separated ; and
that inasmuch as the British inch and multiples of the inch are already establislied
by law and custom and used for practical purposes, in regions inhabited by one-
fourth of mankind, their use oua'ht not to be abandoned in scientific writings.

On Submarine Telegraphy. Bij Captain Selwvn, R.N.

The paper commences by pointing out possible or probable causes of the failure

and loss which have hitherto been lamentably prominent features in these great

enterprises. The author considers tliat there is not the slightest reason to doubt

that gutta-percha, properly laid at the bottom of the sea, in whatever depth, is a

perfect and reliable insulator of electricity, reasoning from the fact that many of

the shallow-water cables have been down from eight to twelve years. The prior

failures are ascribed to faulty mechanical construction of the cable and faulty

mechanical arrangements for its deposition on the bed of the ocean. The life of

the cable, that which must not be injured in any case, is the copper wire that con-

Aveys the electricity.  stretching of this, even to the extent of one in a hundred

(which, be it recollected, means perhaps one mile in a hundred), cannot for an

instant be admitted. Yet this wire is placed in the centre of a comparative^ soft

and absolutely weak core, and surrounded with spirals of iron or steel by way of

giving strength. The axiom of mechanics which is here transgressed is this :

In any structure composed of spirals in combination with straight lines, any strain

must first be borne by the straight lines. It was stated that the best insulator is

the compound of Mr. John Macintosh, one-half cheaper than either gutta-percha

or india-rubber, and much superior to either gum, both in goodness of insulation

and loAvness of inductive capacity. AVitli regard to the route which it is advisable

to pursue : recent discoveries of shoal water, 80 furlongs halfway, lat. 43° 30' N.,
long. 38° 50' W., in the direct great-circle tract between this country and the

island of Bermuda make it certain that means may be found of dividing any future

cable into comparatively short sections. Captain Selwyn is of opinion that a

species of vulcanized rubber coating will be found the best and cheapest protecting

mmaterial. Captain Selwyn's plan for pajdng out the cable consists the employ-

ment of one or more cylindrical drums, built of sheet iron or wood, as strongly

put together as these materials uow are iu ships, with no more liability to leakage,

but witli the remavlvable differeuce that here j-ou have a ship or floating structure

which is hermetically sealed against the influx of water from an_y other cause. On

these drums or floating cylinders the whole cable to be laid is coiled ; and, owing

to the greab capacity or cubical contents of any cylindrical bod}', as much cable
can be well and safely carried in this way for £5000 as would cost, if in a ship,
£30,000, or six times as much, without the safety. The cable which is now to be
carried bv the Great Eastern could be well carried on two cylinders costing less

than £8000 each.

 On a Macliine for Testing Girders. By J. L. Stoxhert and Robert Pitt.

   The machine (which was exhibited in action to the Members of the Section) con-
sists of a compound steelyard le^er of the first order, from the extremity' of which
is suspended a pan to contain weights, the lesser lever being furnished with a
graduated index and a sliding weight, as in a weighing machine ; the beam under
proof represents the fulcrum, and the resistance is obtained by pivoting the short
end of the larger lever on a centre attached to a mass of stone buried in the ground
or to a screw pile ; the ends of the beam rest upon two moveable standards or
jacks, and are made to rise and fall either by screws or by a hydraulic press ; the
object of this arrangement (which is the principal point of novelty in the machine)
being to preserve the centres of the steelyards in a level line, however great the
deflection of the beam. The deflection is measured on a straight edge, supported
on standards fixed to the ends of the beam, and rising and falling with it, and by
means of a rod screwed to the upper flanch of the centre of the beam, and working
a light lever indicator moving against a quadrant scale, the deflection and set can
be distinctly read off to the jjgth of an inch. The pressure caused by the weight
of the steelyards alone is previously ascertained by actual weighing, and becomes a
constant quantity to be added to the indicated load. The advantages of the ar-
rangement consist in, 1st, perfect safety to the operator ; 2nd, great accuracy in
defining the weight applied, and in determining the deflection and set ; 3rd, extreme
facility of the whole operation, enabling girders to be proved at a cost of about one
shilling per ton of girder ; 4th, moderate cost of the apparatus.

        On Microscopical PJiotoqraplis of various Kinds of Iron and Steel.

                           By H.'C. SoRBT, F.R.S., F.G.S.

   The author first briefly explained how sections of iron and steel may be prepared

for the microscope so as to exhibit their structure to a perfection that leaves little

or nothing to be desired. He then exhibited a series of microscopical photographs,

taken under his directions by Mr. Charles Iloole, illustrating the various stages in
the manufacture of iron and steel, and described the structures which they present.
They show various mixtures of iron, of two or three well-defined compomids of
iron and carbon, of gi-aphite, and of slag ; and these, being present in difl'erent pro-

mportions, and arranged various manners, give rise to a large number of varieties

of iron and steel, difFeiing by well-marked and A^ery striking peculiarities of

structure.

On the Working of Underground Eailivays hy Hydraidie Power.

                             By Mr. SymoNs.

At the last Meeting of the Association Messrs. Hawthorne brought forward a

plan of working railways by fixed steam-engines in connexion with endless wires

working roimd a series of wheels placed between the lines of rail. It was suggested

as especially adapted for imderground railways, where it would be desirable to dis-

pense with locomotives. It will be obvious, however, that a very considerable

drawback to its adoption is the gi-eat loss of power by friction. The author of

this paper suggests that water-power may be substituted with advantage for the

continuous wire ; and he proposes, in fact, to use an endless wire of water instead
Aof one of iron whe.
                      great saving of power would result from the fact that, by

this plan, onl)' the traction- wheels actually in contact with the train would be iu

motion. Drawings were exhibited to show the working of the plan,

          Experiments on the Elasticity of Iron. By James Williams.

   In the engineers' workshop, where straight bars of metal are used for the purpose
of testing the work under process of manufacture, it is necessary to keep at least
three bars or surfaces of eacli kind for the purpose of testing each other; for it has
long been known that a straight edge, got up with all the care and accuracy pos-
sible, true to-day will be bent to-morrow ; indeed the very handling of it while in
use is quite sufficient to distort it to such a degree that the workman frequently
has to put it by awhile until it conies to the natural temperature of the I'oom he
works in, the partial heat of the hands alone being sufficient to render it useless
for its object. In getting up straight edges and flat sm-faces, if two only are used
to test each other, it is all but a certainty that one will be hollow and the other

rounding ; but by using three we are enabled to discover this defect. The author
showed the flexibility of iron and steel by experiments.

 On Imjirovements in the Defence of Ships of War. By Captain AVheatlet.

   The author thinks that in future the mode of attacking an iron ship will be to
imitate the practice of a breaching battery on shore, where all the guns are directed

to a particular spot in the wall to be breached, and to take the ship's water-line
as a horizontal line, and the line of any prominent mark, as a mast or funnel, for
a perpendicular, and to order all the guns to be directed on the one spot where

these two lines meet. He also proposes that screens of oiled south-wester canvas,
having a piece of heavy wii-e-rope at the bottom, should be let down immediately

the shot has struck, a bag of wood-shavings and a mattress forced into the gap,
covered by a plank and shored up from the inner side of the wing. This will only
stop the main rush of the water ; a great deal will still flow through the irregular
crevices. These he proposes to stop by plastering the canvas to the side vdth
liydraulic cement, which is said to become fixed imder water in a quarter of an

hour.
