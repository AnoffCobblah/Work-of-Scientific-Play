Report of the Council of the British Association as presented
   TO THE General Committee at Dublin, August 26th, 1857.

   I. With reference to the subjects referred to the Council by the General
Committee at Cheltenham, the Council have to report as follows :

      a. The General Committee directed that copies of the two last Reports
   of the Parliamentary Committee should be transmitted to each Member
   of the General Committee, with a request that opinions might be expressed
   on the important subject, "Whether any measures could be adopted
   by the Government or Parliament that would improve the position of
    Science and its cultivators ;" and that such opinions should be forwarded

    for the consideration of the Council before the 20th of September, 1856.
   This direction having been complied with, and a considerable number of

   letters expressing the opinions of individual Members of the General Com-

    mittee having been received, the Council requested the Assistant-General
   Secretary to prepare a digest, and to make such an arrangement of the
    communications themselves as might best facilitate their full consideration

   at a Special Meeting of the Council in January, 1857. At this meeting,
   Lord Wrottesley, President of the Royal Society, being one of the Members
REPORT OP THE COUNCIL.  XXIX

  of the Council of the Association, communicated for the information of
  the Council, certain resolutions which had been adopted by the President
  and Council of the Royal Society, bearing on the same question ; and
  after a full consideration of these resolutions, and of the opinions expressed
  in the letters of the individual Members of the General Committee of the

 --Association, the Council adopted the following Minute, viz. " That the

   Council concur generally in the course of proceeding which has been
  talcen on this subject by the Royal Society, as now explained to them by
  the President of that Society." This Minute was communicated by order
  to the Royal Society, and the Resolutions have been since transmitted by
  Lord Wrottesley to Lord Palmerston, as having been adopted by the Pre-
   sident and Council of the Royal Society and concurred in by the Council

   of the British Association.

      b. The recommendation, that " the application to Government for an
   Expedition to complete our knowledge of the Tides be renewed," was
  referred by the Council to the Committee of 1851, by whom the previous
  application had been made. The Committee consisted of the Rev. Dr.
   Whewell, the Earl of Rosse, Sir John Herschel, and the Astronomer
  Royal. No report has yet been received by the Council of the Com-

   mittee's consequent proceedings.

      c. The recommendation, that " the Application made to Government in
   September 1852, concerning the great Southern Telescope, be renewed,"
   was communicated by the Council to the President and Council of the
  Royal Society, by whom the steps were taken in 1852 to promote this
   important object, and a hope was expressed on the part of the Association
   that the President and Council of the Royal Society would renew their
   efforts to carry out an object of so much interest to astronomy. The

   Council have not been informed of any subsequent proceedings.
      d. The General Committee having directed that " a Memorial should

   be presented to the Admiralty praying for the publication in a simple,

   uniform, and complete shape, tabular and descriptive, of the results of the
   trials of steam-ships employed in the public service," the Council referred

  to the President of the Section of Mechanical Science, with whom the

   request for this publication had originated, for the information required to
   enable the Council to proceed in drawing up the desired Memorial. The
   information was supplied, and a document, drawn up in more limited terms
   than the recommendation, and stating fully the data required and the
   purpose to which it was proposed to apply them, was transmitted to the
   Secretary of the Admiralty, who replied that the Lords Commissioners
   did not think it would be proper for them to give information in regard to
   vessels belonging to private companies. This reply was communicated to
   the President of the Mechanical Section and a Committee acting with him

   on the registration of ships' tonnage, by whom the subject will be again

    brought under the consideration of the Association at this Meeting.
      e. The deputation appointed to wait on Her Majesty's Secretary for

    Foreign Affairs to " urge the desirableness of sending out an annual expe-
   dition to the Niger, as proposed by Dr. Baikie," have informed the Council
   that they have had an interview with Lord Clarendon, and have presented a
   Memorial which was very favourably received, and that the expedition has
   since been appointed, and has proceeded to the Niger under Dr. Baikie's

    direction.

   IL At the Glasgow Meeting of the British Association, a Committee was
appointed by the General Committee to consider a proposition which had
been submitted to them for making a catalogue of the Philosophical Papers
--XXX REPORT 1857.

contained in the various Scientific Transactions andjournals of all countries.
The Report of this Committee was made at the Cheltenham Meeting, and
was communicated by direction of the Council to the President and Council
of the Royal Society, whose cooperation in this important undertaking was
requested. The original Committee appointed by the Association, with the
addition of two Members named by the Council of the Royal Society, were
requested to give the subject a second and more full consideration. Their
Report was presented to the Council of the Royal Society in June last, and
was ordered to be printed and 250 copies to be sent to the British Association,
for distribution amongst the Members of the General Committee at the Dublin
Meeting, with a view to obtain the thorough concurrence and cooperation of
the two Societies in the plan which shall be ultimately adopted for carrying
out a work which promises to be of very considerable advantage to the cul-
tivators of science in all countries.

   III. The Council congratulate the General Committee on the publication
which has taken place in the current year of the Meteorological Observations
made by the Officers of the Irish Trigonometrical Survey at Mountjoy
Barracks, near Dublin. It will be remembered that at the Southampton
Meeting of the Association in the year 1846, a Committee was appointed
to communicate with the Master- General of the Ordnance relative to the
publication of these valuable observations, and that in January 1847, the
Marquis of Anglesey, then holding the office of Master-General of the
Ordnance, expressed to the Committee his readiness to meet the wishes of

the British Association if the Treasury could be induced to grant the neces-
sary funds, for which the Ordnance had not and could not make any pro-
vision. In consequence of this communication, the Council appointed a
deputation to solicit from the Treasury that a grant for the purpose should
be placed at the disposal of the Master-General, and were informed in

reply, through the Secretary of the Ordnance, under date May 31, IS't?,

that the Treasury would be prepared to include the expense of the publica-
tion in the estimate to be laid before Parliament in 1848. The Council were
also favoured with a letter from the Marquis of Anglesey, dated July 10,
1848, stating that " he had directed the publication of the Mountjoy Ob-
servations to be carried into effect with as little delay as possible." The
publication having now taken place, it has appeared to the Council de-
sirable that the part taken by the British Association in recommending and
in procuring the funds for this valuable contribution to the Meteorology
of the British Islands should be thus fully stated ; because it has happened
(no doubt accidentally) that no notice of any of these circumstances appears

in the Preface or in the Introduction of the publication itself.

   IV. The Council have been informed that circumstances will deprive the
Dublin Meeting of the attendance of Edward J. Cooper, Esq., who was
named as one of the Vice-Presidents for the Meeting ; and with the con-
currence of the Local Committee in Dublin, they recommend to the General
Committee that the name of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland should be sub-
stituted for that of Mr. Cooper.

   V. The Council have received letters of invitation to the Association to
hold its Meeting in 1858 in Manchester, from

   The General Purposes' Committee of the City Council.
   The Board of Directors of the Athenaeum.
   The Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester.
   The Botanical and Horticultural Society.
   The Natural History Society.
   The Photographic Society.

at Newcastle.

   VII. The General Committee will receive full information, in the sub-

joined Report from the Kew Committee, of the proceedings of that establish-

ment during the past year ; and the Council are persuaded that the General
Committee will see with pleasure the evidences of the still increasing public
utility of that institution, and of the credit thereby accruing to the British

Association.

        Report of the Kew Committee of the British Association for the

                            Advancement of Science, for 1856-57.

    Since the last Meeting of the British Association, the works necessary for
lighting the Observatory with gas have been executed at a cost of S250,
which has been defrayed by a Grant from the WoUaston Fund by the Pre-
sident and Council of the Royal Society.

   Soon after the last Meeting of the Association, the Board of Works com-
menced the external repairs of the Observatory. These were completed in
November last. The Chairman having represented to the Chief Commis-
sioner of Works the necessity for considerable repairs to the interior of the
Building, the Board of Works agreed to execute such repairs as soon as the
necessary funds should be voted by Parliament. The Committee understand

that the requisite vote has been passed, and that the works will be proceeded
with in the course of the present summer.

   The following memorandum relative to the re-establishment of self-re-
cording magnetic instruments at the Kew Observatory was submitted to the
Committee by General Sabine on July 22, 1 856 :

   " 1. The decennial period in the solar magnetic variations, and its coinci-
dence with a similar period in the frequency and amount of the solar spots,

appear to be highly deserving of attention in an observatory established, as

Kew is, for physical researches.

   " 2. There is reason to suppose that the permanency and regularity in the
occurrence of the decennial period in the magnetic variations, and its coinci-
dence with the periodic variation of the solar spots, might be eiFectually and
satisfactorily tested by observations of both classes of phenomena at the

alternate periods of maximum and minimum, say for example, in 1857 and
1858 as the anticipated period of maximum, and in 1863 and 1864' as the
anticipated period of minimum, and so forth.*

   " 3. The apparatus constructing under the superintendence of Mr. De la
Rue will, it is hoped, fully meet the requirements of the research in respect

to the solar spots.

   "4. Since the time when the magnetic self-recording instruments belong-

ing to the Kew Observatory were constructed under the direction of Mr.

Ronalds, very considerable improvements have been made in the art of Pho-
tography, and the six months' trial which was made by Mr. Welsh of Mr.

Ronalds' instruments, has led in several other respects to suggestions for im-
provements which could not but be expected to be required in instruments
XXxii    --REPORT 1857.

of so novel a kind, while at the same time the six months' trial referred to has
placed bej'ond doubt the sufficiency of a properly conducted research by
means of self-recording instruments for the examination of the solar magnetic

variations,"

   The Committee authorized Mr. Welsh to proceed with the construction of
the instruments, which have now been completed at an expense not exceeding
£250, this sum being defrayed from the funds supplied by the Government
Grant through the Council of the Royal Society, the instruments remaining

at Kew at the disposition of the Council of the Royal Society.

   With the assistance of apparatus lent from General Sabine's department,
the observatory is now possessed of the means of determining with great ac-
curacy the various constants required in magnetic observation. Some alter-
ations in the method of manipulation have, it is believed, added considerably
to the accuracy of observation of the absolute value of the Magnetic

Force.

   At the request of the Foreign Office, Magnetical and Meteorological In-
struments have been prepared at the Observatory for Mr. Lyons M'Leod,
Consul at Mozambique. Mr. M'Leod attended on several occasions in
order to make himself acquainted with their manipulation.

   The following correspondence has taken place relative to an application
from the Austrian Government to be supplied with Magnetical Instruments,
to be employed in the scientific voyage undertaken by His Imperial Majesty's

Frigate " Novara."

written a pressing note to the Admiralty to ask where the enclosed list of

instruments can be procured, and for any assistance we can give in ensuring

  --" Sir, I have received from Mr. James Yates a copy of the letter which

you addressed to him on the ii6th of last month, describing the scheme of the
scientific voyage of circumnavigation about to be undertaken by His Impe-
rial and Royal Majesty's Frigate ' Novara,' and requesting to be furnished with
any suggestions which may assist you in carrying out the objects for which
this voyage has been undertaken. I have deemed, therefore, that it may be
agreeable to you to be informed, that in consequence of an application from
Baron Rothschild to the British Admiralty, I have been requested to under-
take, and have undertaken, to prepare the following instruments named in
Baron Rothschild's letter for the magnetical observations to be made during

the voyage, viz.

  A" 1. Standard Azimuth Compass for the Declination.
  A" 2. Barrow's Inclinometer for the Inclination.
  A" 3. Fox's apparatus with Gimbal Stand for Inclination and Magnetic

Force at sea.

  A" 4. Unifilar Magnetometer for observations of the Absolute Horizontal

Magnetic Force on land.
   " These instruments will be examined and their constants determined at the

Kew Observatory of the British Association for the Advancement of Science,

and will be ready by the end of February or beginning of March, together
with instructions for the use of each of the instruments, and blank forms for
the convenient record of the observations to be made with them. It is most
desirable, however, that the physicist who is to be charged with the observa-
tions should have some previous practice with the instruments, and I would
therefore beg leave to suggest that the gentleman who may be appointed to
that duty should be directed to proceed in the first instance to London, so
as to arrive there about the third week in February, and after having made
himself familiar with the use of the instruments, should take them with him
to Gibraltar, and there await the arrival of the ' Novara ' on the passage from

Trieste to Rio Janeiro.

    " P.S. Several of the instruments above mentioned will be ready by the end
of the present month. Baron Rothschild's letter does not say anything
about Marine Meteorological instruments. Sliould instruments of this de-
scription, such as are now furnished to the British Navy, be desired, they

could be supplied by the Kew Observatory, and might accompany the mag-

netical instruments to Gibraltar."

The Magnetical Instruments for this Expedition have been prepared, and

the Constants determined at the Observatory. Dr. Hochstatter, of Vienna,

who has undertaken the superintendence of the Magnetical Observations to

be made during the voyage, visited the Observatory in the end of February

and beginning of March, to receive instructions in the use of the various

instruments.

   A letter has been received by General Sabine from the Archduke Ferdi-

nand Maximilian, expressing his thanks, as Chief Officer of the Austrian

--Navy, for the assistance aflForded to Dr. Hochstatter, who writes that he had

commenced his observations : Dr. Hochstatter's letter is dated Gibraltar,

21st May, 1857.
   In consequence of an application from the Hydrographer of the Admiralty,

Dr. Baikie and Lieut. Glover, who have recently sailed on an expedition to
Africa, were furnished witii Magnetical Instruments, whose Constants had

been previously determined at the Observatory. Dr. Baikie and Lieut. Glover
visited the Observatory, when detailed instructions were communicated to

them by Mr. Welsh, as to the practical use of the instruments.
   Application having been made to the Royal Society by Her Majesty's

Secretary of State for the Colonies, relative to a supply of Magnetical In-
struments for an expedition to British North America, under the direction

of Mr. Palliser, Lieut. Blakiston, R.A., who accompanies the Expedition,
attended for some time at the Observatory for the purpose of manipulating

with the Magnetical Instruments, which have been prepared under the direc-
tion of Mr. Welsh for the use of the Expedition. The Constants of these
instruments were determined as in the other instances already referred to in

this Report.

    At the request of the Council of the Royal Society, Mr. Welsh has pre-
pared the Magnetical Instruments required in the North Polar Expedition,
which has been fitted out at the expense of Lady Franklin : the cost of pre-
paration of these instruments is defrayed by the Royal Society. The instru-
ments themselves have been supplied from Major-General Sabine's establish-

ment at Woolwich.
    General Sabine having communicated to the Committee that £200 had

been placed at his disposal by the Admiralty, for the purpose of conducting
the Magnetical Survey of Scotland, in connexion with the general Magnetic
Survey of the British Islands, as recommended at the last Meeting of the
Association, the Committee have arranged that Mr. Welsh shall undertake
such survey in the course of the present and following summer.

    Sir James Clark Ross has already commenced the Survey of England,

taking Kew as his base station.
   A new method, proposed by Dr. Lloyd, of determining the absolute total

 magnetic force by means of the Dip Circle, will be employed in this Survey.
 Dip Circles adapted for this method have been supplied to Sir James C. Ross
 and Mr. Welsh, also to Lieut. Blakiston for his Survey in North America.

    On the 20th of May, 1854, Benj. Oliveira, Esq., F.R.S., placed the sum of
 £50 at the disposal of the Council of the Royal Society, to be appropriated

 during that year in any manner the Council might consider most in harmony
 with the interests of Science. Mr. Oliveira further stated, that he might pro-
 bably in future years offer a similar sum if the mode of its disposal appeared
 to him eligible ; and an application having at the same time oeen made by

 the Kew Committee for the sum of £150, in order to erect a Photographic

 Apparatus for registering the position of the spots in the Sun's disc, as sug-
 gested by Sir John Herschel, the Council of the Royal Society devoted to
 this purpose the donation of Mr. Oliveira, and proposes, should it be con-

 tinued, to apply it for the next two years in replacement of the sum of £100
 which the Council in the mean time advanced from the Donation Fund of
 the Royal Society, in order that the undertaking might not be delayed. This
 arrangement was approvc^d by Mr. Oliveira, and the apparatus has, under the
 direction of Warren Do la Rue, Esq., F.R.S., been completed by Mr. Ross

 at the cost of about £180.

3^The object-glass of this instrument is     inches aperture and 50 inches

focal length ; it is not corrected for achromatism in the ordinary manner, but
so as to produce a coincidence of the visual and photogenic foci. The

secondary objectives for magnifying the image produced by the principal

object-glass are of the Huyghenian form. They are three in number, pro-
ducing respectively images of the sun 3, 4, and 8 inches in diameter. Between

the two lenses of each of these secondary object-glasses is inserted a dia-

phragm-plate carrying the fixed micrometer wires, which are of platinum

these wires are four in number, two at right angles to the other two. One
of the wires of each pair is in such a position that they may both be made

tangential to the sun's image, while the other two cross at a point situated

near the sun's centre. By means of these wires, the distance in arc between

each pair having been once for all ascertained astronomically for each

secondary object-glass, it will be easy to determine all the data necessary for

ascertaining the relative magnitudes and positions of the sun's spots. These

micrometer wires are under the influence of springs, so as to preserve a tension

upon them when expanded by the sun's heat, and thus to lieep them straight.

The principal and secondary object-glasses are not mounted in an ordinary

cylindrical tube, but in a pyramidal trunk square in section, 5 inches in the

side at the upper end, which carries the principal object-glass, and 12 inches

in the side at the lower end, which carries the photographic plate-holder and

the usual ground glass screen for focusing.

This trunk is firmly supported by a declination axis of hard gun-metal 2^

inches in diameter; it is furnished with a declination circle 10 inches in dia-

meter, reading to one minute of arc, and has a clamp and screw motion for

fine adjustment in declination.

The declination axis works in Y-bearings at the top of the polar axis, which

is 12 inches long; it is 4 inches diameter at its upper end and 1-| inch at
its lower end. The lower end fits with a slight taper into a brass collar up

to a shoulder, the friction being reduced by a steel spring plate pressing

against a hardened steel hemisphere at the end of the axis.

It will be seen by the above description, tliat every precaution has been

taken to secure stiff'ness in the telescope combined with freedom in the

motion of the polar axis. The polar axis is driven by a clock driver, which

answers perfectly, and is easy of regulation to the greatest nicety, so that tiie

sun's limb remains for a long period in contact with the tangential wires.

Near the lower end of the polar axis is fixed the hour-circle, which, like the

declination circle, is 10 inches indiameter ; it is graduated to read to 2 seconds of

time. An endless screw, making about two revolutions in one minute, geers

into the hour-circle and connects it with the clock. As it is generally ne-

cessary to make small corrections in right ascension after the tangent screw

has been geered with the driving clock, in order to bring the sun's image in

position with respect to the micrometer wires, a sliding plate is provided which

carries the bearings of the tangent screw ; this is acted upon by a second fine
screw parallel with the tangent screw ; so that by rotating the second screw,

the sliding plate and the tangent screw are moved through a small space,

and the hour-circle thus caused to rotate to the extent necessary for bringing

the sun's image in position.

   The clock is driven by two weights, one pulling upwards over a pulley, the
other downwards, thus suspending the barrel and equalizing the pull and
avoiding friction on its bearings. By causing the click of the winding lever

to abut on the ratchet-wheel of the going part of the clock during the period
of winding, the clock goes at its normal speed while it is being wound.

The mode of regulating the clock is extremely simple and efficacious ; it is

                                                                           c2

effected by approaching to, or withdrawing from, a hollow cone over a small
wheel, on which are attached, by means of flat springs, two small weights,
which expand by centrifugal force and come in contact with the inside of the

hollow cone.

   The polar axis of the telescope is carried by a dial-plate, which fits on the
top of a hollow column of cast iron, the section of which is a parallelogram.
This column is securely fastened to the stone foundation. The instrument is
mounted within the rotating dome of the Kew Observatory, which has been
repaired and put in order for that purpose. The photographic dark room is
at present too distant from the telescope, but it is contemplated to construct
one close to it, as serious inconvenience has been already experienced in the

preliminary experiments in consequence thereof.

   The telescope and its mechanical appliances may be said to be perfect so
far as they go, but experience will undoubtedly suggest several minor alter-
ations and additions before the telescope is brought practically to work. The

photographing of such minute objects as the sun's spots will require at all
times the utmost skill and care of an accomplished photographer, even when
the telescope has been fairly started. The difficulties yet to be mastered must
occupy some considerable time. The first attempts have been confined to the
production of negative photographs, but in consequence of the imperfections
always existing in the collodion film, it has been deemed advisable to make

attempts to produce positive pictures, and recourse may ultimately have to
be made to the Daguerreotype process.

   The verification of Meteorological Instruments has been continued on the
same plan as in previous years. The following are the numbers of instruments
which have been verified since the leist meeting of the Association :

xxxviii  --REPORT 1857.

Report of the Parliamentary Committee to the Meeting of the British
                     Association at Dublin, i?i August 1857.

The Parliamentary Committee have the honour to report as follows :

   The questi(m discussed in the Report of your Committee, addressed to
the Meeting held at Glasgow in 1855, viz. "Whether any measures could be

adopted by the Government or Parliament that would improve the position
of Science and its cultivators," has been much considered by the Council of
the Royal Society. They assembled for this purpose in the autumn of last

year, and were then assisted in their deliberations by the replies received to

the circular of the 20th August last, agreed upon at Cheltenham, and issued
to all Members of the General Committee.

   Of these replies an able digest has been prepared by Professor Phillips,
who was also a Member of the Sub-Committee appointed on behalf of the

Royal Society to consider this important subject.

   The Council of the Royal Society, at their meeting held on the 15th of
January last, passed twelve Resolutions, which may be considered as

embodying their reply to the question above stated, and your Committee

are gratified by observing that most of the recommendations adopted in the

Glasgow Report have, in substance, received the sanction of the official

representatives of the most ancient and venerable of our Scientific Institu-

tions. At that meeting of the Council a resolution was passed, that the

President be authorized to communicate the twelve Resolutions to your

Committee, with a request that the same might obtain such support from our
Members as they might consider them entitled to receive. The Council of

the Royal Society likewise resolved that a copy of their Resolutions should
be forwarded to Lord Palnierston by their President, who by letter, bearing

date the 28th of January, transmitted the same accordingly.

The consideration of the steps proper to be taken in pursuance of the

above request addressed to your Committee, formed the chief subject of our

Wedeliberations during the current year.  determined that it was not expe-

dient at present to take any steps beyond moving for the production of the

letter of the President of the Royal Society of the 28th of January above-

mentioned, with the copy of the twelve Resolutions enclosed therein ; and

this has been done accordingly, in the House of Lords by Lord Burlington,
and in the House of Commons by Mr. Robert Stephenson.

  We were much influenced in this determination by the consideration of

the peculiar circumstances under which Parliament met, which have much

abridged the time at their disposal for the discussion of any measures of

importance, and by the further consideration that it might not be expedient

to precipitate a decision on matters which were new to the general public.

   Again, though the Resolutions in question have received the general

approval of your Council, at a meeting held on the 16th January last, we

thought it right that the Committee of Recommendations should have an

opportunity of expressing their opinion upon them before any steps were

taken to urge their adoption on the Government or Parliament.
   By the retirement of ]\Tr. Hey wood from Parliament, your Committee have

been deprived of the services of one of the most zealous of their members.
Mr. Heywood was not only most constant in his attendance, but no one had

the objects for which your Committee was constituted more sincerely at

heart.

   The Duke of Argyll and the Earl of Rosse must, in pursuance of the

resolution adopted at Liverpool in 1854', be deemed to have vacated their
seats in your Committee, but we recommend that they should be re-elected.
BECOMMENDATIONS OF THE GENERAL COMMITTEE. XXXIX

   Your Committee also recommend that the two vacancies caused by the
retirement from Parliament of Sir Charles Lemon, Bart., and Mr. Hey wood,

be filled by the election of the Right Honourable Joseph Napier, M.P. for
the University of Dublin, and Edward Cooper, Esq., F.R.S., of Markree

Castle, M.P. for the County of Sligo.

  We have also to report the loss of the services of Mr. John Ball. His

scientific knowledge and zeal in the cause rendered him a valuable Member

of your Committee. This vacancy still remains to be supplied by the

General Committee.

       Involving Applications to Government or Public Institutions.

 --Resolved, That it is of great importance to the progress of Science that the

Magnetic Observations which have already added so much to our knowledge
of terrestrial magnetism, should be continued. That the influence of the

Association will be well employed in attaining this object, and that it is
desirable to obtain the cooperation of the Royal Society. That a Committee
be appointed, consisting of the President, the Rev. Dr. Robinson, and Major-
General Sabine, to request, on the part of the British Association, the co-
operation of the President and Council of the Royal Society, and to take in
conjunction with them such steps as may appear necessary, including, if it
be thought desirable, an application to Government.

   That Lord Wrottesley, Dr. Robinson, Mr. Osier, General Sabine, Mr.
Welsh, Sir W. S. Harris, and Dr. Whewell, be appointed a Committee to
express to the Board of Trade the wish of the British Association that self-
recording Anemometrical Instruments should be established on some of the
islands in the Atlantic Ocean, in aid of the Meteorological Observations now
being carried on on ship-board under the direction of the Meteorological
department of the Board of Trade.

   That application be made to Her Majesty's Government to send a vessel
to examine and survey the entrance to the Zambesi River in South Africa,
and to ascend the river as far as may be practicable for navigation. That the
following Gentlemen be appointed a deputation to make the application :
The President, Sir R. I. Murchison, Sir H. Rawlinson, General Sabine, Mr.
Macgregor Laird.

   That the President, the Lord Wrottesley, the Right Honourable J. Napier,
Dr. Robinson, and Major-General Sabine, be a Committee for the purpose
of making application to the Government to send a vessel to the vicinity of
Mackenzie River, to make a series of magnetic observations, with special
reference to the determination of the laws now known to rule the magnetic

storms.

   It having been found that the application of science to the improvement
of Steam-ships has been impeded by the difficulty of obtaining the necessary

-- --data from the present registration, Resolved That a Committee be ap-

pointed and authorized to communicate, if necessary, with the Board of

--Trade on the subject; the Committee to consist of Admiral Moorsom,

Mr. J. Scott Russell, Mr. J. E. M'Connell, Mr. Charles Atherton, Mr. Wil-
liam Fairbairn, Mr. J. Perry, Mr. Henry Wright, Mr. Henderson.

                     Applications for Reports and Researches.

   That Dr. Odling be requested to prepare a Report on the recent progress

of Organic Chemistry.
   That Professor Haughton and Mr. David Forbes, F.G.S., be requested to

furnish a Report on the state of our knowledge of the Mineralogical and
Chemical composition of Rocks of an Igneous origin.

      The Rev. HUMPHREY LLOYD, D.D., D.C.L.,

    F.R.S.L. & E., V.P.R.I.A., Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin.

      Gentlemen of the British Association,
Before I proceed to the task which devolves upon me this evening, in
virtue of the position in which your kindness has placed me, suffer me first

to thank you for the high honour you have conferred. But, highly as I
esteem the distinction, it was not without hesitation that I accepted it ; for no

one can feel more strongly than I do myself how unfit I am for some of the
duties connected with it, or how much more adequately they might have

been performed by others. But I knew, at the same time, that it has been
the desire of your Council, when practicable, to select your President from
among those local Members who had served in the ranks of the Association
and had shared in its labours ; and with such knowledge, and the conscious-
ness that I had, at least, that humble claim, I felt that I had no right to dis-
pute your choice.

   I do not know whether I may venture to interpret further your motives, and

to assign another reason for your selection. Two-and-tvventy years have

elapsed since you visited this city. Upon that occasion my nearest relative

presided, and I myself had the honour of serving as one of your local Secre-

taries. Many concurring circumstances contributed to make that meeting

an agreeable one ; and if your Council has thought fit, on this occasion, to
associate th@ present with the memories of the past, the motive is, at least, a
pardonable one.

   Gentlemen, this is to me a solemn occasion. Two-and-twenty years are

no inconsiderable portion even of the longest life ; and that man's moral na-
ture is not to be envied, who can contemplate the distant past thus vividly
recalled without emotion. These two decades have brought with them their
own large measure of change. The Body in which we are associated has
xlvili  REPORT 1857.

grown up from youth to maturity ; many of its honoured names are now

sought for only in the imperishable records of their toils ; the institutions
which welcomed it here upon its former visit to this city have all received

the impress of the changing times. And yet, amid all this change, we meet

-- --once more in the same city, in the same room, to enter again on the same

labours ; our assemblage is now, as it was before, dignified by the presence
of the Representative of Majesty ; and I see around me, associated for this

--task, many of those who shared it before; the men whose sagacity first per-

ceived the want of such a Society as this, whose energy supplied it, and
whose wisdom directed its steps while it had need of guidance.

   I trust I may be forgiven for dwelling thus far on the peculiar circum-
stances under which we are here assembled ; and I now hasten to discharge

the task which the usages of this Chair impose upon me, and proceed to lay

before you, as well as I am able, a brief sketch of the recent progress of some
of those Sciences to whose advancement we are pledged by our institution.

In doing so, I gladly follow the practice which has of late become the rule,
namely, that your President for each year should bring under your notice
chiefly, the recent additions to those departments of Science with which he
happens to be himself most familiar. It is plainly fitting that he who addresses
you should speak, as far as he can, from his own acquired knowledge. Partial
views are better than inexact ones ; and provision is made for their comple-
tion in the annual change of your Officer. In the present instance I derive
the full advantage of this arrangement, inasmuch as the subjects upon
which I could not thus speak have been, most of them, ably treated by ray

predecessor in this Chair.

  --To commence, then, with Astronomy : The career of planetary discovery,

which began in the first years of the present century, and was resumed in
 184-5, has since continued with unabated ardour. Since 1 846 not a single
year has passed without some one or more additions to the number of the
planetoids; and in one year alone (18,52), no fewer than eight of these
bodies were discovered. The last year has furnished its quota of five ; and in
the present three more have been found, one by Mr. Pogson of Oxford, and

the other two by M. Goldschmidt of Paris. Their known number is now

forty-five. Their total mass, however, is very small ; the diameter of the
largest being less than forty miles, while that of the smallest, Atalanta, is

little more than four.
    These discoveries have been facilitated by star-maps and star-catalogues,

the formation of which they have, on the other hand, stimulated. Two very

--extensive works of this kind are now in progress, the Star-catalogue of M.

 Chacornac, made at the Observatory of Marseilles, in course of publication
 by the French Government, and that of Mr. Cooper, made at his Observa-
 tory at Markree, in Ireland, which is now being published by the help of the
 parliamentary grant of the Royal Society. It is a remarkable result of the
                                 ADDRESS.          xliX

latter labour, that no fewer than seventy-seven stars, previously catalogued,

are now missing. This, no doubt, is to be ascribed, in part, to the errors of
former observations ; but it seems reasonable to suppose that, to some extent

at least, it is the result of changes actually in progress in the Sidereal

Systems.

  --The sudden appearance of a new fixed star in the heavens, its subsequent

--change of lustre, and its final disappearance, are phenomena which have

at all times attracted the attention of astronomers. About twenty such have

been observed. Arago has given the history of the most remarkable, and

discussed the various hypotheses which have been proposed for their expla-

nation. Of these, the most plausible is that which attributes the phenomenon

to unequal brightness of the faces of the star, which are presented success-

ively to the earth by the star's rotation round its axis. On this hypothesis
the appearance should he periodic. M. Goldschmidt has recently given sup-
port to this explanation, by rendering it probable that the new star of 1609

is the same whose appearance was recorded in the years 393,798, and 1203

its period, in such case, is 405^ years.
   The greater part of the celestial phenomena are comprised in the move-

ments of the heavenly bodies, and the configurations depending on them;
and they are for the most part reducible to the same law of gravity which

governs the planetary motions. But there are appearances which indicate

the operation of other forces, and which therefore demand the attention of

--the physicist, although, from their nature, they must probably long remain

subjects of speculation. Of these the spiriform nebulae, discovered by Lord

Rosse, have been already referred to from this Chair, as indicating changes

in the more distant regions of the universe, to which there is nothing entirely

analogous in our own System. These appearances are accounted for, by an

able anonymous writer, by the action of gravitating forces combined with

--the efiects of a resisting medium, the resistance being supposed to bear a

sensible proportion to the gravitating action.

The constitution of the central body of our own System presents a nearer

and more interesting subject of speculation. Towards the close of the last

century many hypotheses were advanced regarding the nature and constitu-

tion of the Sun, all of which agreed in considering it to be an opaque body,

surrounded at some distance by a luminous envelope. But the only certain

fact which has been added to science in this department is the proof given

by Arago, that the light of the Sun emanated, not from an incandescent

solid, but from a gaseous atmosphere ; the light of incandescent solid bodies
he'ing polarized hy refraction, while the light of the Sun, and that emitted by

gaseous bodies, is unpolarized.

According to the observations of Schwabe, which have been continued

without intermission for more than thirty years, the magnitude of the solar

surface obscured by spots increases and decreases periodically, the length of

the period being 11 years and 40 days. This remarkable fact, and the rela-

tion which it appears to bear to certain phenomena of terrestrial magnetism,

liave attracted fresh interest to the study of the solar surface ; and, upon the
suggestion of Sir John Herschel, a photo-heliographic apparatus has lately

been established at Kew, for the purpose of depicting the actual macular

state of the Sun's surface from time to time.
   It is well known that Sir William Herschel accounted for the solar spots

by currents of an elastic fluid, ascending from the body of the Sun, and pene-

Atrating the exterior luminous envelope.  somewhat different speculation

of the same kind has been recently advanced by Mosotti, who has endea-

voured to connect the phenomena of the solar spots with those of the red

protuberances, which appear to issue from the body of the Sun in a total
eclipse, and which so much interested astronomers in the remarkable eclipse

of 1842.

   Next to the Sun, our own satellite has always claimed the attention of
astronomers, while the comparative sraallness of its distance inspired the hope
that some knowledge of its physical structure could be attained with the
large instrumental means now available. Accordingly, at the Meeting of
the Association held at Belfast in 1852, it was proposed that the Earl of
Rosse, Dr. Robinson, and Professor Phillips be requested to draw up a Re-
port on the physical character of the Moon's surface, as compared with that
of the Earth. That the attention of these eminent observers has been
directed to the subject, may be inferred from the communication since made
by Professor Phillips to the Royal Society on the lunar mountain, Gassendi,
and the surrounding region ; but I am not aware that the subject is yet ripe
for a Report.

   I need not remind you, that the Moon possesses neither sea nor atmo*

sphere of appreciable extent. Still, as a negative, in such case, is relative
only to the capabilities of the instruments employed, the search for the indi-
cations of a lunar atmosphere has been renewed with every fresh augmen-

tation of telescopic power. Of such indications the most delicate, perhaps,
are those afforded by the occultation of a planet by the Moon. The occul-
tation of Jupiter, which took place on the 2nd of January last, was observed
with this reference, and is said to have exhibited no hesitation, or change of
form or brightness, such as would be produced by the refraction or absorp-
tion of an atmosphere. As respects the sea, the mode of examination long
since suggested by Sir David Brewster is probably the most effective. If

water existed on the INIoon's surface, the Sun's light reflected from it should

be completely polarized at a certain elongation of the Moon from the Sun.
No traces of such light have been observed ; but I am not aware that the

observations have been repeated recently with any of the larger telescopes.

   It is now well understood that the path of astronomical discovery is ob-
structed much more by the Earth's atmosphere, than by the limitation of

telescopic powers. Impressed with this conviction, the Association has, for

some time past, urged upon Her Majesty's Government the scientific import-
ADDRESS.  u

ahce of establishing a large reflector at some elevated station in the Southern

Hemisphere. In the meantime, and to gain (as it were) a sample of the
results which might be expected from a more systematic search, Professor
Piazzi Smyth undertook, last summer, the task of transporting a large collec-

--tion of instruments meteorological and magnetical, as well as astronomical
--to a high point on the Peak of Teneriffe. His stations were two in num-

ber, at the altitudes above the sea of 8840 and 10,700 feet respectively ; and
the astronomical advantages gained may be inferred from the fact, that the

heat radiated from the Moon, which has been so often sought for in vain in a

lower region, was distinctly perceptible with the aid of the thermo-multiplier.

   The researches relative to the Figure of the Earth, and the Tides, are in-

timately connected with Astronomy, and next claim our attention.

   The results of the Ordnance Survey of Britain, so far as they relate to the

Earth's figure and mean density, have been lately laid before the Royal So-

ciety by Colonel James, the Superintendent of the Survey. The elHpticity

deduced is ;;g|-j. The mean specific gravity of the Earth, as obtained from

--the attraction of Arthur's Seat, near Edinburgh, is 5*316, a result which

accords satisfactorily with the mean of the results obtained by the torsion

balance. Of the accuracy of this important work it is sufiicient to observe,

--that when the length of each of the measured bases in Salisbury Plain, and
--on the shores of Lough Foyle was computed from the other, through the

whole series of intermediate triangles, the difference from the measured

length was only 5 inches in a length of from 5 to 7 miles.

    Our knowledge of the laws of the Tides has received an important acces-
sion, in the results of the Tidal Observations made around the Irisli coasts

in 1851, under the direction of the Royal Irish Academy. The discussion of

these observations was undertaken by Professor Haughton, and that portion

of it which relates to the diurnal tides has been already completed and
published. The most important result of this discussion is the separation of

--the effects of the Sun and the Moon in the diurnal tide, a problem which

was proposed by the Academy, as one of the objects to be attained by the
contemplated observations, and which has been now for the first time solved.
From the comparison of these effects Professor Haughton has drawn some
remarkable conclusions relative to the mean depth of the sea in the Atlantic.
In the dynamical theory of the tides, the ratio of the solar to the lunar effect

depends not only on the masses, distances, and periodic times of the two

luminaries, but also on the depth of the sea; and this, accordingly, may
be computed when the other quantities are known. In this manner Professor
Haughton has deduced, from the solar and lunar coefficients of the diurnal

--tide, a mean depth of 5*12 miles, a result which accords in a remarkable

manner with that inferred from the ratio of the semidiurnal coefficients, as
obtained by Laplace from the Brest observations. The subject, however, is
far from being exhausted. The depth of the sea, deduced from the solar

                                                                      d2
--lii REPORT 1857.

and lunar tidal intervals, and from the age of the lunar diurnal tide, is some-
what more than double of the foregoing ; and the consistency of the indi-
vidual results is such as to indicate, that their wide difference from the former
is not attributable to errors of observation. Professor Haughton throws out
the conjecture tliat the deptli, deduced from tlie tidaXintervals and ages, corre-
sponds to a different part of the ocean from that inferred from the heights.

The plieiioineiia of Terrestrial Magnetism present many close analogies

witli those of the tides ; and their study has been, in a peculiar manner, con-

nected with the labours of this Association. To this body, and by the hands

of its present General Secretary, were presented those Reports on the dis-

tribution of the Terrestrial Magnetic Force which reawakened the attention

of the scientific world to the subject. It was in the Committee-rooms of

this Association that the first step was taken towards that great magnetic

--organization which has borne so much fruit ; it was here that the philoso-
--phical sagacity of Herschel guided its earlier career ; and it was here again

that the cultivators of the science assembled, from every part of Europe, to

deliberate about its future progress. It was natural, therefore, that the re-

sults obtained from such beginnings should form a prominent topic in the

addresses which have been annually delivered from this Chair ; and the same

circumstances will plead my excuse, if I now revert to some of them which

have been already touched upon by my predecessors.

It has been long known that the elements of the Earth's magnetic force

were subject to certain regular and recurring changes, whose periods were,

respectively, a day and a year, and which, therefore, were referred to the Sun

as their source. To these periodical changes Dr. Lamont, of Munich, added

another of ten years, the diurnal range of the magnetic declination having

been found to pass from a maximum to a minimum, and back again, in

about that time.

But besides these slow and regular changes, there are others of a different

class, which recur at irregular intervals, and which are characterized by a

large deviation of the magnetic elements from their normal state, and gene-

rally also by rapid fluctuation and change. These phenomena, called by

Humboldt " magnetic storms," have been observed to occur simultaneously

in the most distant parts of the earth, and therefore indicate the operation

of causes affecting the entire globe. But, casual as they seem, they are

found to be subject to laws of their own. Professor Kreil was the first to
discover that, at a given place, they recurred more frequently at certain

hours of the day than at others ; and that consequently, in their mean effects,
they were subject to periodical laws, depending upon the hour at each station.

The laws of this periodicity have been ably worked out by General Sabine,

in his discussion of the  results  of the  British  Colonial  Observatories                                                    and
                                                                                                                            ;

he has added the important facts, that the same phenomena observe also the

two other periods already noticed, namely the annual and the decennial

periods. He has further arrived at the very remarkable result, that the de-
ADDRESS.  liii

 cennial magnetic period coincides, both in its duration and in its epochs of
maxima and minima, with the decennial period observed by Schwabe in the
solar spots ; from which it is to be inferred that the Snn exercises a magnetic
influence upon the Earth, dependent on the condition of its luminous

envelope.

  We are thus in the presence of two facts, which appear at first sight

opposed, namely, the absolute simultaneity of magnetic disturbances at all
parts of the Earth, and their predominance at certain local hours at each
place. General Sabine accounts for this apparent discrepancy by the cir-

cumstance, that the hours of maximum disturbance are different for the
different elements ; so that there may be an abnormal condition of the

magnetic force, operating at the same instant over the whole globe, but
manifesting itself at one place chiefly in one element, and at another place
in another. I would venture to suggest, as a subject of inquiry, whether the
phenomena which have been hitherto grouped together as " occasional
effects, may not possibly include two distinct classes of changes, obeying

--separate laws one of them being strictly periodic, and constituting a part of

the regular diurnal change, while the other is strictly abnormal, and simul-
taneous. If this be so, it would follow that we are not justified in separating
the larger changes from the rest, merely on the ground of their magnitude
and that a different analysis of the phenomenon will be required.

   The effects hitherto considered are all referable to the Sun as their cause.
Professor Kreil discovered, however, that another body of our System

--namely, our own satellite exerted an effect upon the magnetic needle

and that the magnetic declination underwent a small and very regular varia-
tion, whose amount was dependent on the lunar hour-angle, and whose period
was therefore a lunar day. This singular result was subsequently confirmed
by Mr. Broun, in his discussion of the Makerstoun Observations ; and its
laws have since been fully traced, for all the magnetic elements, by General
Sabine, in the results obtained at the Colonial Magnetic Observatories.

   The foregoing facts bear closely upon the debated question of the causes
of the magnetic variations. It has been usual to ascribe the periodical
changes of the Earth's magnetic force to the thermic action of the Sun,
operating either directly upon the magnetism of the Earth, or affecting it
indirectly by the induction of the thermo-electric currents. Here, however,
we have a distinct case of magnetic action, unaccompanied by heat ; and
the question is naturally suggested, whether the solar diurnal change may
not also be independent of temperature.

   The most important fact, in its bearing upon this question, is the existence
of an annual inequality in the diurnal variation, dependent on the Sun's
declination, recently pointed out by General Sabine. If we deduct the
ordinate of the curve, which represents the mean diurnal variation for the
entire year, from those for the summer and winter half-yearly curves re-
spectively, the differences are found to be equal and opposite ; and the curves
--Uv RKPOBT 1857.

which represent them are, consequently, similar, but oppositely placed with
respect to the axis of abscissae. From this General Sabine draws the in-
ference, that the diurnal variation is a direct effect of solar action, and not a
result of its thermic agency.

The most important step which has been recently taken in this country

to advance the science of Meteorology, has been the formation of a depart-

ment connected with the Board of Trade, for the collection and discussion

of Meteorological Observations made at sea. The practical results of a

similar undertaking in the United States are now well known. The charts

and sailing directions, published by Lieutenant Maury, have enabled navi-

gators to shorten their passages, in many cases by one-fourth of the time,

and in some even to a greater extent. The commercial importance of such

results could not fail to attract general attention ; and accordingly, when

the United States Government invited other maritime nations to cooperate

Ain the undertaking, the invitation was cordially accepted.  conference was

held at Brussels in 1853, at which meteorologists deputed by those Powers

attended ; and a Report was made, recommending the course to be pursued

in a general system of marine meteorological observations. This Report

was laid before the British Parliament soon after, and a sum of money was

voted for the necessary expenditure. The British Association undertook to

supply verified instruments, by means of its Observatory at Kew ; and the

Royal Society, in consultation with the most eminent meteorologists of

Europe and America, addressed an able Report to the Board of Trade, in

which the objects to be attended to, so as to render the system of observa-

tion most available for science, were clearly set forth. With this cooperation

on the part of the two leading Scientific Societies, the establishment was

soon organized. It was placed under the direction of a distinguished naval

officer, Admiral FitzRoy ; and in the beginning of 1855 it was in operation.

Agents were established at the principal ports for the supply of instruments,

books, and instructions ; and there are now more than 200 British ships so
furnished, whose officers have undertaken to make and record the required

observations, and to transmit them from time to time to the Department. At

the present time TOO months of logs have been received, from nearly 100

merchant ships, and are in process of tabulation.

Holland is taking similar steps; and the Meteorological Institute of that

counti-y, under the direction of Mr. Buys Bellot, has already published three
volumes of nautical information, obtained from Dutch vessels in the Atlantic

and Indian Ocean.

For the purposes of Meteorological Science this system cannot be con-

sidered as complete, until observations on land are included. Most of the

greater atmospheric changes are due to the distribution of land and water,

and to the different effects of the Sun's rays on each. Observation alone

can furnish the data from which the effects of these agencies may be calcu-

lated ; and we can therefore probably make no great advance in the knowledge
                         ADDRESS.                            Iv

of the meteorology of the globe, without a concurrent investigation of its two
leading departnaents. Land observations exist in great numbers. In Prussia,
in Russia, in Austria, and in Belgium, such observations are organized
under Government direction, or at least with Government support ; in other
parts of Europe, as in Britain, the labour is left to individuals or scientific

--societies. What is needed is to give unity to these isolated laboui-s to con-

nect them with one another, and with the results obtained at sea ; and the
first step to this seeros to be, to give them, in each country, that permanence
and uniformity of system which can only be ensured in measures adopted
by the State.

Here, however, we encounter an objection, upon which it is necessary to

say a few words.

It has been objected to the Science of Meteorology, as it is usually studied,

that it proceeds upon a false method ; and that, consequently, it has led, and
can lead, to no results. I feel myself in a manner compelled to notice this

grave objection, in the first place, because it proceeds from men, whose

opinions on this (or almost any other scientific question) are entitled to the

highest deference ; and secondly, because this Association must bear no in-

considerable measure of the reproach, if it be %vell founded.

   First, then, as to results. I am free to admit that the number of those

engaged in the discussion of meteorological observations is disproportioiiately
small, and that the results obtained probably fall far short of what may be

expected from the data already accumulated. But that the methods have

led, and can lead, to no results, is, I think, sufficiently disproved by the

--labimrs of a single man Professor Dove of Berlin. And if it be true that

the course pursued in the science has yielded much fruit, in proportion to

the labour bestowed on the discussion, it will hardly be deemed widely

--erroneous. Still, as it is possible that the methods pursued though not
--fruitless may be inadequate, it seems necessary to notice the objection

somewhat more minutely.

It is asserted, then, that the capital vice of tlie Science of Meteorology,

as at present pursued, is that it has no definite aim ; that it ought to embrace
an inquiry into the physical constitution of the objects with which the science

is concerned, and an investigation of causes as well as laws of phenomena.

It may be admitted, at once, in reference to this objection, that the phy-

sical constitution of the bodies whose changes we are investigating is a proper

object of study to the physicist ; but it does not seem to follow that it should

necessarily be conducted by the same individuals who are in search for the

laws of the phenomena, or even that the former knowledge is essential to the

progress of the latter. The noblest of all the physical sciences, Astronomy,

--is little more than a science of laws laws, too, of the simplest kind of

change; and the knowledge of these laws is wholly inde}iendetit of the physi-

Acal constitution of the masses whose movements it studies.  similar obser-

vation may be made regarding the science of Terrestrial Magnetism; and
--Ivi REPORT 1857.

the case is one which brings us still nearer to the question at issue, inasmuch

-- --as the laws which have been obtained and they are numerous have resulted

from a method of inquiry altogether similar to that adopted in Meteorology.
   Time will not permit me to inquire whether there is not a misconception

of a metaphysical kind at the root of this objection. I may observe, how-
ever, before leaving the subject, that there are two modes of studying the

--sequences of natural phenomena, one in their relation to time, and which is

best accomplished by observations at stated periods, and the other in the
relation of the successive phases of the phenomenon to one another. Of these,
the latter, although not wholly neglected, has not been so much followed as
it deserves ; and I cannot but think that it would, if more systematically
followed, enrich the science of Meteorology with a new harvest of results.

   The most important of the recent additions to the theory of Liff/it have
been those made by M. Jamin. It has been long known that metals differed

from transparent bodies, in their action on light, in this, that plane-polarized

light reflected from their surfaces became elliptically polarized ; and the
phenomenon is explained, on the principles of the wave-theory, by the

assumption that the vibration of the ether undergoes a change of phase at
the instant of reflexion, the amount of which is dependent on its direction,

and on the angle of incidence. This supposed distinction, however, was

soon found not to be absolute. Mr. Airy showed that diamond reflected

light in a manner similar to metals ; and Mr. Dale and Professor Powell ex-

tended the property to all bodies having a high refractive power. But it

was not until lately that M. Jamin proved that there is no distinction, in this

respect, between transparent and metallic bodies ; and that all bodies trans-
form plane-polarized into elliptically-polarized light, and impress a change

of phase at the moment of reflexion. Professor Haughton has followed up

the researches of M. Jamin, and established the existence of circularly-

polarized light by reflexion from transparent surfaces.

The theoretical investigations connected with this subject afford a re-

markable illustration of one of those impediments to the progress of Natural

Philosophy, which Bacon has put in the foremost place among his examples

--of the Idola, I mean the tendency of the human mind to suppose a greater

simplicity and uniformity in nature than exists there. The phenomena of

polarization compel us to admit that the sensible luminous vibrations are

transversal, or in the plane of the wave itself; and it was naturally supposed

by Fresnel, and after him by MacCullagh and Neumann, either that no

normal vibrations were propagated, or that, if they were, they were uncon-

Wenected with the phenomena of light.  now learn that it is by them that

the phase is modified in the act of reflexion ; and that, consequently, no

dynamical theory which neglects them, or sets them aside, can be complete.

    Attention has been lately recalled to a fundamental position of the wave-
theory of light, respecting which opposite assumptions have been made.
                             ADDRESS.      Ivii

The vibrations of a polarized ray are all parallel to a fixed direction in the

plane of the wave ; but that direction may be either parallel, or perpendi-

cular to the plane of polarization. In the original theory of Fresnel the
latter was assumed to be the fact ; and in this assumption Fresnel has been

followed by Cauchy. In the modified theories of MacCullagh and Neumann,
on the other hand, the vibrations are supposed to be parallel to the plane of

polarization. This opposition of the two theories was compensated, as re-
spects the results, by other differences in their hypothetical principles ; and
both of them have led to conclusions which observation has verified. There
seemed, therefore, to be no means left to the theorist to decide between these
conflicting hypotheses, until Professor Stokes, recently, in applying the
dynamical theory of light to other classes of phenomena, found one in which

the effects should differ on the two assumptions. When light is transmitted

through a fine grating, it is turned aside, or diffracted, according to laws

which the wave-theory has explained. Now Professor Stokes has shown

that, when the incident light is polarized, the plane of vibration of the
diffracted ray must differ from that of the incident, the two planes being

connected by a very simple relation. It only remained, therefore, for ob-

servation to determine whether the planes of polarization of the incident
and refracted rays were similarly related, or not. The experiment was

undertaken by Professor Stokes himself, and he has inferred from it that the

original hypothesis of Fresnel is the true one ; but, as an opposite result has

been obtained by M. Holtzmann, on repeating the experiment, the question
must be regarded as still undetermined. The difference in the experimental

results is ascribed by Professor Stokes to the difference in the nature of the

gratings employed, the substance of the diffracting body being supposed to
exert an effect upon the polarization of the light, which is diffracted by it

under a great obliquity. I learn from Professor Stokes that he proposes to
resume the experimental inquiry, and to test this supposition by employing

gratings of various substances. If the conjecture should prove to be well

founded, it will, unfortunately, greatly complicate the dynamical theory of
light. In the meantime the hypothesis is one of importance in itself, and
deserves to be verified or disproved by independent means. I would venture

to suggest that it may be effectively tested by means of the beautiful Inter-
ference-refractor of M. Jamin, which the inventor has already applied to
study the effects upon light produced by grazing a plate of any soluble sub-

stance enclosed in a fluid.

It is well known that the refractive index of bodies increases with their

density ; and the theory of emission has even expressed the law of their

mutual dependence. That theory, it is true, is now completely overthrown

MM.by the decisive experimentum crucis of  Fizeau and Foucault. It was

--therefore probable, a priori, that this law the only one peculiar to the

--theory would be found wanting. Its truth has recently been put to an ex-

perimental test by M. Jamin. Water, it is known, has its maximum of

density at about 40° of Fahrenheit ; so that, if Newton's law were true, its
Iviii REPORT-- 1857.

refractive index should also have a maximum value at the saino temperature.
This has been disproved by M. Jamin, by observing the interference of two

rays, one of which has passed through air, and the other through water
and thus the last conclusion of the emission-theory has been set aside.

   It Mould occupy too much of your time were I to touch, even lightly,
upon the subject of the chemical action of light, and the many beautiful and

important discoveries of the art to which it has given rise. I may, however,

mention, as one of the latest of the marvels of photography, that M. Poitevin
has succeeded in producing plates in relief, for the purposes of engraving, by
the action of light alone. The process depends upon the change in the
affinity for water, produced by the action of light upon a thin plate of

gelatine, which is impregnated with bichromate of potash.

   In the whole range of experimental science there is no fact more familiar,
or longer known, than the development of Heat by friction. The most

--ignorant savage is acquainted with it, it was probably known to the first

generation of mankind. Yet, familiar as it is, the science of which it is the
germ dates back but a very few years.

   It was known from the time of Black, that heat disappeared in producing
certain changes of state in bodies, and reappeared when the order of those
changes was reversed ; and that the amount of heat, thus converted, had a
given relation to the effect produced. In one of these changes, namely
evaporation, a definite mechanical force is developed, which is again absorbed
V hen the vapour is restored by pressure to the liquid state. It was therefore
not unnatural to conjecture, that in all cases in which heat is developed by
mechanical action, or vice versti, a definite relation would be found to subsist
between the amount of the action, and that of the heat developed or absorbed.

   This conjecture was put to the test of experiment by Mayer and Joule,
in ] 84'2) and was verified by the result. It was found that heat and mechanical
pozver were mutually convertible., and that the relation between them was
definite, 111 foot pounds of motive power being equivalent to a unit of heat,
that is, to the amount of heat requisite to raise a pound of water through
one degree of Fahrenheit. The science of Thermo-dynamics, based upon
this fact, and upon a few other obvious facts, or self-evident principles, has
grown up in the hands of Clausius, Thomson, and Rankine, into large pro-
portions, and is each day making fresh conquests from the region of the
unknown.

    Thus far the science of Heat is made to rest wholly upon the facts of ex-
periment, and is independent of any hypothesis respecting the molecular
constitution of bodies. The dynamical theory of heat, however, has mate-

rially aided in establishing true physical conceptions of the nature of heal.

The old hypothesis of caloric, as a separate substance, was indeed rendered
improbable by the experiments of Rumford and Davy, and by the reasonings
ADDRESS.  liX

qf Young ; but it continued to liold its ground, and is interwoven into the
language of science. It is now clearly shown to be self-contradictory ; and
to lead to the result, that the amount of heat in the universe may be indefi-
nitely augmented. On the other hand, the identification of radiant heat with
light, and the establishment of the wave-theory, left little doubt that heat
consisted in a vibratory movement either of the molecules of bodies, or of
the ether within them. Still, the relation of heat to bodies, and the phenomena
of conduction, indicate a mechanism of a more complicated kind than that of
light, and leave ample room for further speculation.

   The only mechanical hypothesis (so far as I am aware) which is consistent

with the present state of our knowledge of the phenomena of heat, is the
theory of molecular vortices of Mr. Rankine. In this theory all bodies are
supposed to consist of atoins, composed of nuclei surrounded with elastic
atmospheres. The radiation of light and heat is ascribed to the transmission
of oscillations of the nuclei ; while thermometric heat is supposed to consist
in circulating currents, or vortices^ amongst the particles of their atmospheres,
whereby they tend to recede from the nuclei, and to occupy a greater space.
From this hypothesis Mr. Rankine has deduced all the laws of thermo-

dynamics, by the application of known mechanical principles. He has also,

from the same principles, deduced relations (which have been confirmed by
experiment) between the pressure, density, and absolute temperature of
elastic fluids, and between the pressure and temperature of ebullition of

liquids.

   The dynamical theory of heat enables us to frame some conjectures to
account for the continuance of its supply, and even to speculate as to its
source. The heat of the Sun is dissipated and lost by radiation, and must
be progressively diminished unless its thermal energy be supplied. According
to the measurements of M. Pouillet, the quantity of heat given out by the
Sun in a year is equal to that which would be produced by the combustion of
a stratum of coal seventeen miles in thickness ; and if the Sun's capacity for
heat be assumed equal to that of water, and the heat be supposed to be
drawn unilbrmly from its entire mass, its temperature would thereby undergo

a diminution of 2°"4' Fahr. annually.

   On the other hand, there is a vast store of force in our System capable of

conversion into heat. If, as is indicated by the small density of the Sun,
and by other circumstances, that body has not yet reached the condition of

incompressibility, we have, in the future approximation of its parts, a fund
of heat probably quite large enough to supply the wants of the human
family to the end of its sojourn here. It has been calculated that an amount
of condensation, which would diminish the diameter of the Sun by only the
ten-thousandth part, would suffice to restore the heat emitted in 2000 years.

    Again, on our own Earth, vis viva is destroyed by friction in the ebb and
flow of every tide, and must therefore reappear as heat. The amount of this
must be considerable, and should not be overlooked in any estimation of the

physical changes of our globe. According to the computations of Bessel,

Wetemperature of our globe augmented, by every tide.  do not possess the

data which would enable us to calculate the magnitude of these effects.

All that we know with certainty is, that the resultant effect of all the thermal

agencies to which the Earth is exposed, has undergone no perceptible change

Wewithin the historic period.   owe this fine deduction to Arago. In order

that the date palm should ripen its fruit, the mean temperature of the place

must exceed 70° Fahr. ; and, on the other hand, the vine cannot be cultivated
successfully when the temperature is 72° or upwards. Hence the mean

temperature of any place, at which these two plants flourished and bore fruit,

must lie between these narrow limits, i. e. could not differ from 71° Fahr. by

more than a single degree. Now, from the Bible we learn that both plants

were simultaneously cultivated in the central valleys of Palestine, in the time

of Moses, and its then temperature is thus definitively determined. It is the

same at the present time ; so that the mean temperature of this portion of

the globe has not sensibly altered in the course of thirty-three centuries.

The future of physical science seems to lie in the path upon which three

of our ablest British physicists have so boldly entered, and in which they have
already made such large advances. I may therefore be permitted briefly to

touch upon the successive steps in this lofty generalization, and to indicate

the goal to which they tend.

It has been long known that many of the forces of nature are related.

Thus heat is produced by mechatiical action, when that is applied in bringing

the atoms of bodies nearer by compression, or when it is expended in friction.

Heat is developed by electricity, when the free passage of the latter is impeded

it is produced whenever light is absorbed ; and it is generated by chemical

Aaction.  like interchangeability probably exists among all the other forces

of nature, although in many the relations have not been so long perceived.

Thus the development of electricity from chemical action dates from the

observations of Galvani ; and the production of magnetism by electricity

from the discovery of Oersted.

The next great step was to perceive that the relation of the physical forces

was mutual ; and that of any two, compared togetlier, either may stand to

the other in the relation of cause.

With respect to heat and mechanical force, this lias been long known.

When a body is compressed by mechanical force, it gives o\xiheat; and, on the

other hand, when it is heated, it dilates, and evolves jooM'er. The knowledge

of the action of electricity, in dissolving the bonds of chemical union, followed

closely upon that of the inverse phenomenon, and the discovery of electro-

magnetism by Oersted was soon followed by that of magneto-electricity by

Faraday. With reason, therefore, it occurred to many minds that the relations

--of any two of the forces of nature were mubual; that that which is the cause,
ADDRESS.                                              M

in one' mode of interaction, may become the effect, when the order of the

--phenomena is changed; and that therefore, in the words of Mr. Grove, one

of the able expounders of these views, while they are " correlative " or reci-

procally dependent, "neither, taken abstractedly, can be said to be the

essential cause of the others."

   But a further step remained to be taken. If these forces were not only
related, but mutually related, was it not probable that the relation was also a
definite one ? Thus, when heat is developed by mechanical action, ought we
not to expect a certain definite proportion to subsist between the interacting

forces, so that if one were doubled or trebled in amount, the other should

undergo a proportionate change? This anticipation, it has been already
stated, has been realized by Mayer and Joule. The discovery of the mecha-

nical equivalent of heat has been rapidly followed by that of other forces
and we now know not only that electricity, magnetism, and chemical action,
in given quantities, will produce each a definite amount of mechanical work,

-- --but we know further chiefly through the labours of Mr. Joule what that

relation is, or, in other words, the mechanical equivalent of each force.

  --The first step in this important career of discovery though long unper-
--ceived in its relation to the rest was, undoubtedly, Faraday's proof of the

definite chemical effect of the voltaic current. The last will probably be to
reduce all these phenomena to modes of motion, and to apply to them the
 known principles of dynamics, in such a way as not only to express the laws
 of each kind of movement, as it is in itself, but also the connexion and de-
pendence of the different classes of the phenomena.

A bold attempt at such a generalization has been made by M. Helmholtz.

The science of Thermo-dynamics starts from the principle, that perpetual

motion is impossible, or, in other words, that we cannot, by any combination

of natural bodies, produce force out of nothing. In mechanical force, this

principle is reducible to the known law of the conservation of living force
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ',

and M. Helmholtz has accordingly endeavoured to show that this law is

maintained in the interaction of all the natural forces ; while, at the same
time, the assumption of its truth leads to some new consequences in physics,

not yet experimentally confirmed. Expressed in its most general form, this

principle asserts that the gain of vis viva during the motion of a system, is

equal to the force consumed in producing it ; from which it follows, that the

sum of the vires vivce, and of the existing forces, is constant. This principle

AM. Helmholtz denominates the conservation of force.  very important

consequence of its establishment must be, that all the actions of nature are

due to attractive and repulsive forces, whose intensity is a function of the

--distance, the conservation of vis viva holding only for such forces.

It is usually stated, in mechanical works, that there is a loss of vis viva in

the collision of inelastic bodies, and in friction. This is true with respect to

the motion of masses, which forms the subject of mechanical science as at

present limited ; but it is not true in a larger sense. In these, and such like
kii REPOttt-- 1857.

cases, the movement of masses is transformed into molecular motion, and thlis
reappears as heat, electricity, and chemical action ; and the amount of the
transformed action definitely corresponds to the mechanical force which was

apparently lost.
    In the cases just considered, mechanical action is converted into molecular.

But molecular actions of different kinds are themselves in like manner
interchangeable. Thus, when liffhf is absorbed, vis viva is apparently lost

--but not to speak ofphosphorescence, in which the light absorbed, or a portion
--of it, is again given out in all such cases, heat and chemical action are

developed, and in amount corresponding to the loss. Hence the apparent
exceptions to the principle are in reality confirmations of it ; and we learn
that the quantity of force in nature is as unchangeable as the quantity of

matter.
    This, however, is not true of the quantity of available force. It follows

from Carnot's law, that heat can be converted into mechanical work only
when it passes from a warmer to a colder body. But the radiation and con-
duction by which tiiis is effected, tend to bring about an equilibi-ium of tem-
perature, and therefore to annihilate mechanical force : and the same destruc-
tion of energy is going forward in the other processes of nature. Thus, it
follows from the law of Carnot, as Professor Thomson has shown, that the
universe tends to a state of eternal rest ; and that its store of available force
must be at length exhausted, unless replenished by a new act of Creative Powet.

   Mr. Rankine has attempted, in another method, to combine the physical
sciences into one system, by distinguishing the properties which the various
classes of physical phenomena possess in common, and by taking for axioms
propositions which comprehend their laws. The principles thus obtained arfe

a.^n\\cd\i\e to all physical change; .and they possess all the certainty of the

facts from which they are derived by induction. The subject-matter of the
science so constituted is energy, or the capacity to effect changes ; and its
fundamental principles are-- 1st, that all kinds of energy and work are homd-
treneous, or, in other words, that any kind of energy may be made the means
of performing any kind of work ; and '2nd, that the total energy of a substance
cannot be altered by the mutual action of its parts. From these principles
the author has deduced some very general laws of the transformation of
energy, which include the known relations of physical forces.

    I have occupied your time so largely with the sciences of one section, that

I cannot do more than advert to one or two topics connected with the others,

which have struck my own mind, although, from my limited acquaintance

with the subjects, I could not venture to say that they are absolutely the

most deserving of notice.

Amon<T the most remarkable of the recent discoveries in inorganic che-

MM.mistry are those of     Wcihler and Deville, relative to silicon and boron.

Each of these substances is now proved to exist in three very different states,
           ADDRESS.                                        ma

analogous to the three known states of carbon, to which they are thus closely
allied, namely charcoal, graphite, and diamond. The last of these states is,
of course, the most interesting. Crystallized boron possesses a hardness,
brightness, and refractive power comparable to those of diamond ; it burns
in chlorine, without residue, and under circumstances resembling those of
the combustion of diamond in oxygen ; it is not acted on by any of the acids,
and appears to be the least alterable of all the simple bodies. I have been
informed that its powder is already used in the arts, instead of diamond dust;
and it seems not improbable that, when obtained by the chemist in crystals
of larger size, it may rival the diamond as a gem.

   The science of Geology appears, of late years, to have entered upon a new

--phase of its development, one characterized by a stricter reference of its

speculative views to the principles of those sciences with which it is con-

nected, and upon which it ought to be based. The able memoirs of Mr.

Hopkins, on what may be called dynamical geology, afford a remarkable

proof of this ; and we have another instance of the application of sound phy-

sical principles to this science in the explanations which have been recently

Aoffered of the phenomena of slaty cleavage.  Report on this interesting

subject was presented to the Association by Professor Phillips at its last

Meeting, and will be found in the volume just published. These sounder

views originate, I believe, with himself and with Mr. Sharpe; but they have

been enlarged and confirmed by Mr. Sorby, Dr. Tyndall, and Professor

Haughton.

We have an interesting proof of the readiness of geologists of the present

day to submit their views to the test of exact observation, in the measure-

ments undertaken by Mr. Horner for the purpose of approximating to the

age of the sedimentary deposits. Of the geological changes still in opera-

tion, none is more remarkable than the formation of deltas at the mouths of

great rivers, and of alluvial land by their overflow. Of changes of the latter

kind, perhaps the most remarkable is the great alluvial deposit formed in the

valley of the Nile by the annual inundations of that river; and here it for-

tunately happens that history comes to the aid of the geologist. These sedi-

mentary deposits have accumulated round the bases of monuments of known

age, and we are therefore at once furnished with a chronometric scale by

which the rate of their formation may be measured. The first of the series

of measurements undertaken by Mr. Horner was made, with the coopera-

tion of the Egyptian Government, around the obelisk of Heliopolis, a monu-

Ament built, according to Lepsius, 2300 years b.c.  more extensive series

of researches has been since undertaken in the district of Memphis ; but

Mr. Horner has not yet, I believe, published the results.

   The problems now to be solved in Palceontology are clearly defined in the
enunciation of the problem recently proposed by the French Academy of

Sciences as one of its prize questions, viz. " to study the laws of distribution
--Ixiv REPORT 1857.

of organic beings in the different sedimentary rocks, according to the order
of their superposition ; to discuss the question of their appearance or disap-
pearance, whether simultaneous or successive; and to determine the nature
of the relations which subsist between the existing organic kingdom and its

anterior states." The prize was obtained by Professor Bronn, of Heidelberg
and his memoir, of which I have only seen an outline, appears to be cha-
racterized by views at once sound and comprehensive. The leading result
seems to be, that tiie genera and species of plants and animals, which geology
proves to have existed successively on our globe, were created in succession,
in adaptation to the existing state of their abode, and not transmuted or
modified, as the theory of Lamarck supposes, by the physical influences which
surrounded thera.

I must now pass from tiie results of science to the administrative measures

which have been adopted by this Association for its advancement, and more

especially to those which will be brought under your consideration at the

present Meeting.

One of the modes in which this Association most effectively promotes the

advancement of Science is, you are aware, by the preparation and publication

of Reports on the history, and actual state, of its several branches. With

the help of these, original investigators may, with little labour, ascertain all

that has been accomplished in each department, before they proceed to in-

crease the store ; and so not only prepare their own minds for their task, but

also avoid the waste of time and toil which has been too often incurred in

the re-discovery of the same truths.

To further the same objects, it was proposed by Professor Henry, of

Washington, at the Glasgow Meeting of the Association, that a Catalogue of

papers occurring in the Transactions of Scientific Societies, and in the

Scientific Journals, should be prepared by the Association, the Smithsonian

Institution undertaking to execute that part of the work whicii related to

AAmerican Science.  Committee, consisting of Mr. Cayley, Mr. Grant, and

Professor Stokes, was appointed to consider this proposal, and their Report

was submitted to the Cheltenham Meeting. The subject has since been under

the consideration of the Council of the Royal Society ; and a preliminary

Report has been drawn up by a sub-Committee of that body, which will

probably be brought before your Committee at this meeting.

  A still more important question has been, for some years, under the con-

--sideration of this Association and the Royal Society the question, namely,

whether any measures could be adopted by the Government, or Parliament,
that would improve the position of Science or its cultivators in this country.

   The Parliamentary Committee of the Association have taken much pains
in the attempt to arrive at a solution of this large and complex question.
They consulted, in the first instance, several of the most eminent scientific
men of this country ; and in their first Report, presented to the Meeting of
            ADDRESS.                          Ixv

the Association at Glasgow, they have analysed the replies obtained, and
have recommended certain general measures founded thereon. The most

important of these recommendations are the provision, at the cost of the nation,
of a central building in London, in which the principal Scientific Societies of

the metropolis may be located together ; and the formation of a Scientific

Board, to have the control and expenditure of the public funds allotted to the
advancement of science. This Report was brought under the consideration
of your Committee of Recommendations at the last two Meetings of the Asso-
ciation ; and the opinions of the members of the General Committee have been
since invited in reference to its suggestions. The Council of the Royal
Society have likewise deliberated on the same question, and have passed

certain resolutions on the subject, which accord in substance with the con-

Aclusions of the Parliamentary Committee.  copy of these resolutions

was forwarded by Lord Wrottesley, as President of the Society, to Lord

Palmerston ; and motions have been made in both Houses of Parliament for

the production of the correspondence.

 --The first of the objects above referred to namely, the juxtaposition of
--the Scientific Societies of London in one locality has been since accomplished

by the grant of Burlington House for the use of the Royal, Linnsean, and

Chemical Societies ; and the result aff'ords a fresh instance of the readiness
of Her Majesty's Government to listen to, and comply with, the suggestions
of men of science, when deliberately and carefully made. I cannot but

think that this important step is fraught with consequences affecting the

promotion of science, and extending far beyond the external and obvious
advantages, which it ensures to the Scientific Societies more immediately

benefited.

   Another mode in which this Association has materially aided in the
advancement of science is through the instrumentality of its Observatory at
Kew. The objects which are at present attained by that important establish-
ment are, the trial and improvement of instrumental methods, and especially
of those connected with the photographic registration of natural phenomena;
the verification of meteorological instruments, and the construction of stand-
ard barometers and thermometers ; the supervision of apparatus to be
employed by scientific travellers, and the instruction of the observers in their
use; and lastly, the conduct of special experimental researches, undertaken by
members of the Association at its request. In all these various ways, the

labours of the Kew Observatory have tended, in no small degree, to the

advancement of the sciences of Observation and Experiment in this country
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

and the result is due, not only to the sagacity of the Committee under whose
management it is placed, but also, and eminently, to the zeal and talents of
Mr. Welsh, and the gentleman who has the immediate charge of the esta-

blishment.

There is but one other topic connected with the administration of the

Ixvi  REPORT 1857.

Association to which I feel it necessary to invite your attention before I con-

--clude, I mean the change which has been made in the constitution of one

of the Sections, and which will come into operation at the present Meeting.
   By a resolution of your Committee, adopted at the last Meeting, the scope

of the '* Statistical Section " has been enlarged, and it now embraces Econo-

mic Science in all its relations. I regard it as a fortunate circumstance for
the Association, that this important change will come into operation under

the Presidency of the distinguislied prelate, whose talents have been so long
devoted to the advancement of this science, and to whose nmnificence we
owe the Jbrmation of a shool of Political Economy in the University of
Dublin, which has already attained a high measure of celebrity. The
Section will have the aid, on this occasion, of more than one of those gentlemen

who have filled the Chair of the Whately Professorship, as well as of other
members of the Statistical Society of Dublin ; and its proceedings will receive
the countenance and support of many foreigners who have devoted them-

selves to the cultivation of Economic Science.

   Gentlemen, suffer me now to thank you for the indulgent attention with
which you have favoured me. I am conscious that the sketch of the recent
progress of the Physical Sciences, which I have endeavoured to present, is
but a meagre and imperfect summary of what has been accomplished ; but
it is enough, at all events, to prove that Science is not on the decline, and
that its cultivators have not been negligent in their high calling. I now beg,
in the name of the Local Members of this body, to welcome you warmly to
this city ; and I pray that your labours here may redound to the glory of
God, and to the welfare and happiness of your fellow-men.

       THE STATE OF SCIENCE.

Report on the Recent Progress of Theoretical Dynamics.

                         By A. Cayley.

The object of the ' Mecanique Analj'tique' of Lagrange is described by the
author in the ' Avertissement' to the first edition as follows :---" On a deja

plusieurs traites de mecanique, mais le plan de celui-ci est entierement neuf.

Je me suis propose de reduire la theorie de cette science et I'art de resoudre

tous les problemes qui s'y rapportent a des forniules generates dont le simple

developpement donne toutes les equations necessaires pour la solution de

chaqiie probleme." And the intention is carried out ; the principle of virtual

velocities furnishes the general formulae for the solution of statical problems,

and D'Alembert's principle then leads to the general formulaa for the solu-

tion of dynamical problems. The general theory of statics would seem to

admit of less ulterior development ; but as regards dynamics, the formulae

of the first edition of the ' Mecanique Analytique' have been the foundation

of a series of profound and interesting researches constituting the science of

analytical dynamics. The present report is designed to give, so far as I am

ablej! a survey of these researches ; there will be found at the end a list, in

chronological order, of the works and memoirs referred to, and I shall in the

course of the report preserve as far as possible the like chronological order.

It is proper to remark that I confine myself to the general theories of dyna-

mics. There are various special problems of great generality, and susceptible

of the most varied and extensive developments, such for instance as the

problem of the motion of a single particle (which includes as particular

cases the problem of central forces, that of two fixed centres, and that of the

motion of a conical pendulum, either with or without regard to the motion

of the earth round its axis), the problem of three bodies, and the problem

of the rotation of a solid body about a fixed point. But a detailed account

of the researches of geometers in relation to these special problems would

properly form the subject of a separate report, and it is not my intention to
enter upon them otherwise than incidentally, so far as it may appear desir-

able to do so. One problem, however, included in the first of the above-

mentioned special problems, I shall have frequent occasion to allude to: I

mean the problem of the variation of the elements of a planet's orbit, which

has a close historical connexion with the general theories which form the

subject of this report. The so-called ideal coordinates of Hansen, and the

principles of his method of integration in the planetary and lunar theories,

have a bearing on the general subject, and might have been considered in

the present report ; but on the whole I have considered it better not to do so.

mcoordinates oc,y,z of the different particles                                                              or dm of the system, quan-

tities which in general are not independent. But Lagrange introduces, in

place of the coordinates x,y,z of the different particles, any variables or

(using the term in a general sense) coordinates £, i//, 0, ... whatever, deter-

mining the position of the system at the time t: these may be taken to be in-

dependent, and then if ^', ;p', 0', . . denote as usual the differential coefficients of

In these equations, T, or the vis viva function, is the vis viva of the system

or sum of all the elements, each into the half square of its velocity, expressed

by means of the coordinates 4,1//,^,..; and (when such function exists) V,
or the force function*, is a function depending on the impressed forces and

expressed in like manner by means of the coordinates ^, -i/^, 0, .. ; the two

T Vfunctions and are given functions, by means of which the equations of

motion for the particular problem in hand are completely expressed. In

any dynamical problem whatever, the vis viva function T is a given function

of the coordinates ^,\p,(p,..., of their differential coefficients ^', i//', ^', . .
and of tiie time t; and it is of the second order in regard to the differential

coefficients I', 4/', cp', .. .; and (when such function exists) the force function

V is a given function of the coordinates ^, \^,<p,.. and of the time t. This

is the most general form of the functions T, V, as they occur in dynamical

problems, but in an extensive class of such problems the forms are less

VTgeneral, viz. and are each of them independent of the time, and T is a

homogeneous function of the second order in regard to the differential

coefficients ^', ;//', 0', .. ; the equations of motion have in this case an integral
T4-V=/«, which is the equation of vis viva, and the problems are distin-

guished as those in which the principle of vis viva holds good. It is to be

noticed also that in this case since t does not enter into the differential equa-

tions, the integral equations will contain t in the form t-\-c, that is, in con-

nexion with an arbitrary constant c attached to it by addition.
   2. The above-mentioned form '\s par excellence the Lagrangian form of the

equations of motion, and the one which has given rise to almost all the ulte-

rior developments of the theory ; but it is proper just to refer to the form
in which the equations are in the first instance obtained, and which may be

        3. The idea of a force function seems to have originated in the problems
    of physical astronomy. Lagrange, in a memoir ' On the Secular Equation
    of the Moon,' crowned by the French Academy of Sciences in the year
     1774', expressed the attractive forces, decomposed in the directions of the
     axes of coordinates, by the partial differential coefficients of one and the same
    function with respect' to these coordinates. And it was in these problems
     natural to distinguish the forces into principal and disturbing forces, and
     thence to separate the force function into two parts, a principal force function
     and a disturbing function. The problems of physical astronomy led also to

      the idea of the variation of the arbitrary constants of a mechanical problem.

     For as a fact of observation the planets move in ellipses the elements o
     which are slowly varying; the motion in a fixed ellipse Avas accounted for
     by the principal force, the attraction of the sun ; the effect of ihe disturbing
     force is to produce a continual variation of the elements of such elliptic
     orbit. Euler, in a memoir published in 1749 in the ' Memoirs of the Academy

      of Berlin' for that year, obtained differential equations of the first order for
     two of the elements, viz. the inclination and the longitude of the node, by
     making the arbitrary constants which express these elements in the fixed
     orbit to vary : this seems to be the first attempt at the method of the varia-
      tion of the arbitrary constants. Euler afterwards treated the subject in a

     more complete manner, and the method is also made use of by Lagrange in
     his ' Memoir on the Perturbations of the Planets' in the Berlin Memoirs for
     1781, 1782, 1783, and by Laplace in the 'Mecanique Celeste,' t. i. 1799.
     The method in its original form seeks for the expressions of the variations

      of the elements in terms of the differential coefficients of the disturbing

     function with respect to ihe coordinates. As regards one element, the longi-
     tude of the epoch, such expression (at least in a finite form) was first ob-
     tained by Poisson in his memoir of 1808, to be spoken of presently ; but I
    am not able to refer to any place where such expressions in their best form
     are even now to be found ; the question seems to have been unduly passed
     over in consequence of the new form immediately afterwards assumed by the
     method. It was very early observed that the variation of one of the ele-
     ments, viz. the mean distance, was expressible in a remarkable form by
     means of the differential coefficients of the disturbing function taken with

     respect to the time t, in so far as it entered into the function through the co-

    ordinates of the disturbed planet. I am not able to say at what time, or

     whether by Euler, Lagrange, or Laplace, it was observed that such diffe-
     rential coefficient with respect to the time was equivalent to the difierential

      coefficient of the disturbing function with respect to one of the elements.

     But however this may be, the notion of the representation of the variations
     of the elements by means of the differential coefficients of the disturbing
     function tvith respect to the elements had presented il'ieM a posteriori, and was
     made use of in an irregular manner prior to the year 1800, and therefore
     some eight years at any rate before the establishment by Lagrange of the

     general theory to which these forms belong.
        4. Poisson's memoir of the 20th of June, 1808, 'On the Secular In-

     equalities of the Mean Motion of the Planets,' was presented by him to the
     Academy at the age of twenty-seven years. It contains, as already re-

      marked, an expression in finite terms for the variation of the longitude of
     the epoch. But the memoir is to be considered rather as an application of
     known methods to an important problem of physical astronomy, than as a
      completion or extension of the theory of the variation of the planetary

     elements. The formulse made use of are those involving the differential
     coefficients of the disturbing function with respect to the coordinates ; and

                                                                         b2

there is nothing which can be considered an anticipation of Lagrange's
idea of tiie investigation, d priori, of expressions involving the differential
coefficients with respect to the elements. But as well for its own sake as
historically, the memoir is a very important one. Lagrange, in his memoir
of the 17th of August, 1808, speaks of it as having recalled his attention to
a subject with which he had previously occupied himself, but which lie had
quite lost sight of; and Arago records that, on the death of Lagrange, a
copy in his own handwriting of Poisson's memoir was found among his
papers ; and the memoir is referred to in, and was probably the occasion of,
Laplace's memoir also of the 17th of August, 1S08.

   5. With respect to Laplace's memoir of the 17th of August, 1808, it will

--be sufficient to quote a sentence from the introduction to Lagrange's me-

moir : " Ayant montre a M. Laplace mes forniules et mon analyse, il me
montra de son cote en meme temps des forniules analogues qui donnent

les variations des elemens elliptiques par les differences partielles d'une

meme fonction, relatives a ces elemens. J'ignore comment il y est par-

venu ; mais je presume qu'il les a trouvees par une combinaison adroite des
formules qu'il avait donne dans la 'Mecanique Celeste.'" This is, in fact,

the character of Laplace's analysis for the demonstration of the formulae.

   6. In Lagrange's memoir of the 17th of August, 1808, 'On the Theory
of the Variations of the Elements of the Planets, and in particular on the
Variations of the Major Axes of their Orbits,' the question treated of ap-
pears from the title. The author obtains formulae for the variations of the

elements of the orbit of a planet in terms of the differential coefficients of
the disturbing function with respect to the elements ; but the method is a
general one, quite independent of the particular form of the integrals, and

the memoir may be considered as the foundation of the general theory.
The equations of motion are considered under the form,

cPx_l+m _ rfii

di- r^                                 dx

d^y _\-\-m _dQ.

drz_\-\-m _dQ,
df- ~r^^~'d^'

and it Is assumed that the terms in fi being neglected, the problem is com-
pletely solved, viz., that the three coordinates, x,y,z, and their differential
coefficients, x', y\ z', are each of them given as functions of t, and of the
constants of integration a, b, c,f, g, h ; the disturbing function Q. is conse-
quently also given as a function of t, and of the arbitrary constants. The
velocities are assumed to be the same as in the undisturbed orbit. This
gives the conditions

                                      Zx=0, hj=0, Sz=0;

and then the equations of motion give

--deduces expressions for -, &c., in terms of ---, &c. ; viz.

--The form of the expressions shows at once that (a,b)= (6, a), so that

the number of the symbols (a, b) is in fact fifteen.

Lagrange proceeds to show, that the differential coefficient with respect

to f of the expression represented by the symbol (a, 6) vanishes identically

and it follows, that the coefficients (a, b) are functions of the elements only,

without the time t.

The general formulae are applied to the problem in hand ; and, in con-

sequence of the vanishing of several of the coefficients (a, b), it is easy in

the particular problem to pass from the expressions for ----, &c, in terms of
                                                                                      da

an elegant system of formulae for the variations of the elements of a planet's

respect to the elements ; but it is not for the present purpose necessary to
consider the form of the system, or the astronomical consequences deduced

by means of it.

   7. Lagrange's memoir of the 13th of March, 1809, 'On the General

Theory of the Variation of the Arbitrary Constants in all tlie Problems of

   8. It is proper to remark that, in order to prove that the expressions
(a, b) &c., are independent of the time, Lagrange, instead of considering
the differential coefficients of each of these functions separately, establishes
a general equation (see Nos. 25, 34', 35 of the Addition, and also the Sup-

plement)

where, if Act, A6, .. denote any arbitrary increments whatever of the con-

stants of integration a, b, . . then Ar, &c., are the corresponding increments

of the coordinates r, &c. ; this is, in fact, a grouping together of several

distinct equations by means of arbitrary multipliers, and it is extremely

elegant as a method of demonstration, and has been employed as well by
Lagrange, here and elsewhere, as by others who have written on the

subject; but I think the meaning of the formulae is best seen when the

component equations of the group are separately exhibited, and in the

citation of formula3 I have therefore usually followed this course. Lagrange

gives also an equation which is in fact a condensed form of the preceding

holds good, then if a be the constant of vis viva {T-\-v=-a), and c the

constant attached by addition to the time, then -r=-T-j which, he observes,
                                                                              dt dc

is an equation remarkable as well from its simplicity and generality a8
because it can be obtained a priori, independently of the variations of the

other arbitrary constants : this is obviously the generalisation of the expres-

sion for the variation of the mean distance of a planet.
    10. The consideration of Lagrange's function (a, b) originated, as appears

from what has preceded, in the theory of the variation of the elements ; but
it is to be noticed, that the function (a, b) is altogether independent of the
disturbing function, and the fundamental theorem that {a,b) is a function

of the elements onlj', without the time, is a property of the undisturbed

equations of motion. The like remark applies to Poisson's function (a, b),
in the memoir next spoken of.

   11. Poisson's memoir of the 16th of October, 1809. The formulas of
this memoir are, so to speak, the reciprocals of those of Lagrange. The

--relations between the differential coefficients , &c., of the disturbing func-
                                                                   da

--tion and the variations , &c., of the elements, depend with Lagrange,

upon expressions for the coordinates and their differential coefficients in

terms of the time and the elements ; with Poisson, on expressions for the

elements in terms of the time, and of the coordinates and their differential

coefficients. The distinction is far more important than would at first

sight appear, and the theory of Poisson gives rise to developments which

seem to have nothing corresponding to them in the theory of Lagrange.

The reason is as follows : when the system of differential equations is com-
pletely integrated, it is of course the same thing whether we have the

integral equations in the form made use of by Lagrange, or in that by

Poisson, the two systems are precisely equivalent the one to the other ; but

when the equations are not completely integrated, suppose, for instance, we

have an expression for one of the coordinates in terms of the time and the

elements, it is impossible to judge whether this is or is not one of the inte-

gral equations ; the? differential equations are not satisfied by means of this

equation alone, but only by this equation with the assistance of the other

integral equations. On the other hand, when we have an expression for

one of the constants of integration in terms of the time, and of the co-

ordinates and their differential coefficients, it is possible, by mere substi-

tution in the differential equations, and without the knowledge of any other

integral equations, to see that the differential equations are satisfied, and

that the assumed expression is, in fact, one of the system of integral

equations. An expression of the form just referred to, viz., c=(p {t,x,y,..

x\y' . ..), where the right-hand side does not contain any of the arbitrary
constants, may, with great propriety, be termed an " integral," as distin-

guished from an integral equation, in which the constants and variables

may enter in any conceivable manner ; it is convenient also to speak of such

equation simply as the integral c.

12. Returning now to the consideration of Poisson's memoir, the equa-

tions of motion are considered under the same form as by Lagrange, viz.,

T-- V=Rputting      under the form

                    ddR_dR_da

formation was only effected a considerable time afterwards by Sir W. R.

Hamilton. Poisson then assumes that the undisturbed equations are in-
tegrated in the form above adverted to, viz., that the several elements a,b..
are given as functions of the time t, and of the coordinates 0, &c., and their
differential coefficients (j)', Sec, or wiiat is the form ultimately assumed, as

functions of the time t, of the coordinates f, . ., and of the new varia-
bles s, &c. ; and he then forms the functions

where

             d(o!, b)_da db _db da

             d(s, (^) ds d<j> ds dip

(the notation is the abbreviated one before referred to), and he proves by

differentiation that the differential coefficient of {a, b) with respect to the time

vanishes : that is, that (a, b) which, by its definition is given as a function of t

--and of the coordinates <p,..., and of the new variables s, ..., is really a

constant. Upon which Poisson remarks " On conceit que la constante . .

the attention of geometers was called to it by Jacobi ; it has since been

developed by Bertrand and Bour.

i5. Poisson applies his formulce to the case of a body acted upon by a

central force varying as any function of the distance, and also to the case

of a solid body revolving round a fixed point. There is, as Poisson remarks,

a complete similarity between the formulEe for these apparently very dif-

ferent problems, but this arises from the analogy which exists between the

arbitrary constants chosen in the memoir for the two problems. The

forraulcE obtained form a very simple and elegant system, and one which,

although not actually of the canonical form (the meaning of the term will

be presently explained), might by a slight change be reduced to that form.
   16. I may notice here a problem suggested by Poisson in a report to the

Institute in the year 1830, on a manuscript work by Ostrogradsky on
           ON THEORETICAL DYNAMICS.                                                                              9

Celestial Mechanics, viz., in the case of a body acted upon by a central force,
the effect of a disturbing function, tohich is a function only of the distance
from the centre, is merely to alter the amount of the central force ; and the
 expressions for the variations of the elements should thereibre, in the case
in question, admit of exact integration ; the report is to be found in Crelle,

 t. vii. pp. 97-101.
    17. The two memoirs of Lagrange and Poisson, which have been con-

 sidered, establish the general theory of the variation of the arbitrary con-

stants, and there is not, I think, very much added to them by Lagrange's
memoir of 1810, the second edition of the ' Mecanique Analytique,' J 811,
 or Poisson's memoir of 1816. The memoir by Maurice, in 1844', belongs to

 this part of the subject, and as its title imports, it is in fact a development
 of the theories of Lagrange and Poisson.

     18. There is, however, one important point which requires to be adverted
to. Lagrange, in the memoir of 1810, and the second edition of the
 'Mecanique Analytique,' remarks, that for a particular system of arbitrary
 constants, viz., if a, ... denote the initial values of the coordinates ^, .. and

X,.. denote the initial values |of -7=-,f- then the equations for the varia-

tions of the elements take the very simple form

                                rfa__rfO d\_dil

                            'di~ dx"' dt~da'"'

This is, in fact, the original idea and simplest example of a system of can-
onical elements ; viz. of a system composed of pairs of elements, a, X, the
variations of which are given in the form just mentioned.

   19. The ' Avertissement'to the second edition of the 'Mecanique Analytique'

contains the remark, that it is not necessary that the disturbing function £2

20. Cauchy, in a note in the ' Bulletin de la Societe Philomatique' for

1819 (reproduced in the ' Memoire sur I'lntegration des Equations aux

Derivees Partielles du Premier Ordre,' ' Exer. d'Anal. et de Physique Math.,'

t. ii. pp. 238-272 (1841)), showed that the integration of a partial dif-

ferential equation of the first order could be reduced to that of a single

Asystem of ordinary differential equations.                                particular case of this general

theorem was afterwards obtained by Jacobi in the course of his investiga-

tions (founded on those of Sir W. R. Hamilton) on the equations of dyna-

mics, and he was thence led to a slightly different form of the general
theorem previously established by Cauchy, viz., Cauchy's method gives the

general, Jacobi's the complete integral, of the partial differential equation.

The investigations of the geometers who have written on the theory of
dynamics are based upon those of Sir W. R. Hamilton and Jacobi, and it is
therefore unnecessary, in the present report, to advert more particularly to

Cauchy's very important discovery.

  21. I come now to Sir W. R. Hamilton's memoirs of 1834 and 1835,

which are the commencement of a second period in the history of the sub-

ject. The title of the first memoir shows the object which the author pro-
posed to himself, viz., the discovery of a function by means of which the
integral equations can be all of them actually represented. The method

given for the determination of this function, or rather of each of the several
functions which answer the purpose, presupposes the knowledge of the
inteo-ral equations ; it is therefore not a method of integration, but a theory
of the representation of the integral equations assumed to be known. I
venture to dissent from what appears to have been Jacobi's opinion, tiiat
the author missed the true application of his discovery ; it seems to me, that
Jacobi's investigations were rather a theory collateral to, and historically
arising out of the Hamiltonian theory, than the course of development

which was of necessity to be given to such theory. But the new form ob-
tained in Sir W. R. Hamilton's memoirs for the equations of motion, is a
result of not less importance than that which was the professed object of

--the memoirs.

case of any number of free particles, but, for simplicity, I take the case of a
single particle. The equations of motion are taken to be

Uassumed that the condition of vis viva holds, that is, that is a function of

x,y,zon\y. The initial values of the coordinates are denoted by a,h,c,

and those of the velocities by a', b', c'. The equation of vis viva is
T=U H+ +H, and this gives rise to an equation To=U,,
                                                                                                                                                                                                 of the same form

for the initial values of the coordinates. The author then writes

                 V=f 2Tdt,

an equation, the form of which implies Tthat is expressed as a function

of the time and of the constants of integration a, b, c, a', b', c'. The method

of the calculus of variations leads to the equation

            lY=^m(x'hx+y'hj + z'hz)--m{a'la-irb'ib+c'Zc)^tlB.,

to understand which, it should be remarked that the coordinates x,y,z,

and the velocities a'', ?/', z\ being functions of t and of a, b, c, a', b', c', then

V is, in the first instance, given as a function of these quantities. But

'x,y,z being functions oi a,b,c, a',b',c',t, we may conversely consider

Va',b',c' as functions of .r,y, r, a,b,c,t, and thus becomes a function of

V by the equation

which, if they could be integrated, would give S as a function of x,y,z,
a,b,c, t, and thus determine the motion of the system.

 --24. Hamilton's form of the equations of motion. This is in fact the

form obtained by carrying out the idea of introducing into the differential
equations, in the place of the differential coefficients of the coordinates, the
derived functions (with respect to these differential coefficients) of the
vis viva function T. Taking jj to denote any one of the series of coordi-

nates, then the original system may be denoted by

                                      ~

                                                      dt dt}' di] dt]

(U is the force function taken with a contrary sign to that of Lagrange),
and writing in like manner cr to denote any one of the new variables con-

nected with the coordinates r) by the equations

                                                 rfT_

then T, in its original form, is a function of 77, . . . tj', . .., homogeneous

of the second order as regards the differential coefficients ??'..; and, con-

sequently, these being linear functions (without constant terms) of the new

Tvariables -m, the vis viva function can be expressed as a function of r;, . ..

w, ..,, homogeneous of the second order as regards the variables ct, ...

And when T has been thus expressed, the equations of motion take the form

Uwhich is the required transformation. The force function is independent

of the differential coefficients »;', . . and, consequently, of the variables ot, . .,
H=T--hence, writing

  V25. I have, for greater simplicity, explained the theory of the functions

and S in reference to a very special form of the equations of motion ; but

the theory is, in fact, applicable to any form whatever of these equations

and, as regards the function V, is in the first memoir examined in detail

with reference to Lagrange's general form of the equations of motion. The

function S is considered at the end of the memoir in reference only to the

special form. The new form of the equations of motion is first established

in the second memoir, and the theory of the functions V and S is there con-

sidered in reference to this form. The author considers also another

function Q, which, when the matter is looked at from a somewhat more

general point of view, is not really distinct from the function S.

   * I find it stated in a note to M. Houel's ' These sur I'integration des equations differen-
tielles de la Mecanique,' Paris, 1855, that this form of the equations of motion had been
previously employed in an unpublished memoir by Cauchy,, written in 1831.

   26. The first memoir contains applications of tlie method to the problem
of two bodies, and tlie problem of three or more bodies, and researches in

reference to the approximate integration of the equations of motion by the

separation of the Vfunction into two parts, one of them depending on the

principal forces, the other on the disturbing forces. The method, or one of

the methods, given for this purpose, involves the consideration of the varia-

tion of the arbitrary constants, but it is not easy to single out any precise
results, or explain their relation to the results of Lagrange and Poisson. The
like remark applies to the investigations contained in Nos. 7 to 12 of the
second memoir, but it is important to consider the theory described in the

heading of No. 13, as "giving formulte for the variation of elements more

Hanalogous to those already known." The function is considered as con-

sisting of two parts, one of them being treated as a disturbing function ; the
equations of motion assume therefore the form

of the resulting equations are presented in the form adopted by Poisson,

extended to the complete equations by the method of the variation of the

sidered as functional symbols, have the same meanings as in the theories of

   27. It is to be observed that the disturbing function Y is not necessarily

Hin the same problem identical with the disturbing function of Lagrange

and Poisson (indeed, in any problem, the separation of the forces into prin-

cipal forces and disturbing forces is an arbitrary one). Sir W. R. Hamil-

ton, in the second memoir, gives a very beautiful application of his theory

to the problem of three or-more bodies, which has the peculiar advantage of
making the motion of all the bodies depend upon one and the same disturbing

function*. This disturbing function contains (as in the last-mentioned

general formulae) both sets of variables, and the consequence is that, as the
author remarks, the varying elements employed by him are essentially different
from those made use of in the theories of Lagrange and Poisson ; the ve-
locities cannot, in his theory, be obtained by differentiating the coordinates
as if the elements were constant. The investigation applies to the case
where the attracting force is any function whatever of the distance, and the
six elements ultimately adopted form a canonical system.

   28. The precise relation of Sir W. R. Hamilton's form of the equations

of motion to that of Lagrange's, is best seen by considering Lagrange's
equations, not as a system of differential equations of the second order
between the coordinates and the time t, but as a system of twice as many
differential equations of the first order between the coordinates, their
differential coefficients treated as a new system of variables, and the time.

--It will be convenient to write U, instead of Lagrange's force-function V,

and (to conform to the usage of later writers who have treated the subject
in the most general manner) to represent the coordinates by q, . . ., their
differential coefficients by q', . .., and the new variables which enter into the

Hamiltonian form byjt;, . . .; then the Lagrangian system will be

nected to"-etiier by any equations of condition, then, by means of these

equations, the coordinates x,i/, z of the different points and their differential
coefficients x',i/',z', can be expressed as functions of a certain number

of independent variables (j>, \p, d, &c., and of their differential coefficients

V can of course be obtained directly by integrating the differential ex-

pression, viz. the function so obtained is in value, but not in form. Sir W.

VR. Hamilton's principal function V, for, with him, is a function of the

coordinates, and of a particular set of the constants of integration, viz. the

constant of vis viva h, and the initial value? of the coordinates. Poisson

Vadds the very important leniark, that being determined by his process as

above, then /* being the constant of vis viva, and the constants of the other

given integral equations being e,f, &c., the remaining integrals of the

problem are *

                    dY dY ^ dY

where T,l,m,.. are new arbitrary constants. But, as before remarked, the

dYexpression for    is not always a complete differential.  Poisson accord-

ingly inquires into and determines (but not in a precise form) the condi-

tions which must be satisfied, in order that the expression in question may

be a complete differential. He gives, as an example, the case of the motion

of a body in space under the action of a central force ; and, secondly, the

case considered in Jacobi's letter of 1836, which he refers to, viz., here
dY=x'dx+y'dy, and when the two integral equations are one of them, the

--equation of vis viva ^{x""+y"-) \5-{-h, and the other of them any integral
=equation a F {x,y,x',y') whatever (subject only to the restriction that a

is not a function o^ x,y,x'''+y'^-, the necessity of which is obvious) the con-

dition is satisfied per se, and, consequently, x'dx+y'dy is a complete

differential, and its integral gives (in value, although as before remarked

Vnot iu form) the principal function V; and such value of gives the two

integral equations obtained in Jacobi's letter.

variations, including, indeed, the differential equationsof dynamics, but which
belong to a different field of investigation. The latter part of the note relates
more immediately to the differential equations of dynamics. The author re-

marlcs, that, in any dynamical problem of the motion of a single particle for

which the Y>fmciTp\e o( vis viva holds good, if, besides the integral of vis -viva,

there is given any other integral, the problem is reducible to the integration

of an ordinary differential equation of two variables, and that it is always
possible to integrate this equation, or at least discover hy a precise and

general rule the factor which renders it integrable. This would seem to

refer to Jacobi's researches on the theory of the ultimate multiplier, but the

author goes on to refer to a preceding communication to the Academy of

Paris (the before-mentioned letter of 1836), which does not belong (or, at

least, does not obviously belong) to this theory. He speaks also of a class

of dynamical problems, viz. that of the motion of a system of bodies which
mutually attract each other, and which may besides be acted upon by

forces in parallel lines, or directed to fixed centres, or even to centres the

motion of which is given ; and, he remarks, in the solution of such a pro-

blem, the system of differential equations being in the first instance of the

order 2w (that is, being a system admitting of 2/i arbitrary constants), then

if one integral is known, it is possible by a proper choice of the quantities

2w--selected for variables to reduce the system to the order  2.  If another

integral is known, the equation may in like manner be reduced to a system

--of the order 2n 4, and so on until there are no more equations to be in-

tegrated ; and thus the operations to be effected depend only upon quadra-

tures. All this seems to refer to researches of Jacobi, which, so far as I

am aware, have not hitherto been published. The results correspond with

those recently obtained by ^owr, post, Nos. 66 and 67.

 --33. Jacobi's memoir of 1857. .Jacobi refers to the memoirs of Sir

W. R. Hamilton, and he reproduces, in a slightly different form, the inves-

tigation of the fundamental property of the principal function S. The case
considered is that of a system of n particles, the coordinates of which are
connected together by any number of equations ; but it will be sufficient
here to attend to the case of a single free particle. The equations of motion

are assumed to be

                      ^_rfU d^_d\J <Pz_d\3

                       ""de ~dx ' ""df ~dy ' "^dt^ ~dz '

UBut is considered as being a function of x,i/, z and of the time t, that is,

it is assumed that the condition of vis viva is not of necessity satisfied. The

definition of the function S is

           S-f Z' [\]+^(x''-\-y'-'+z'-')\dt, which,

when the equation oi vis viva is satisfied, that is, when T=^\m{x''^-\-y'^-\-z"')

= U+ /«, agrees with Sir W. R. Hamilton's definition S=2r \]dt+ht. The

function S is considered as being, by means of the integral equations as-
sumed as known, expressed as a function of t, of the coordinates x, y, z, and

of their initial values a, b, c. And then it is shown that S satisfies the equa-

tions

       dS ,                      dS ,       dS ,

SO that the intermediate and final integrals are expressed by means of the

principal function S.

34.. But Jacobi proceeds, " the definition assumes the integration of the

differential equations of the problem. The results, tlierefore, are only

interesting in so far as they have reduced the system of integral equations

Weinto a remarkable form.         may, however, define the function S in a

quite different and very much more general manner." And then, attending

only to the case of a system of free particles, he gives a definition, which, in

the case of a single particle, is as follows :

U(where is in general a function of x^y, z and #), then S is defined to be a

complete solution of the partial differential equation

  A complete solution, it will be recollected, means a solution containing as

many arbitrary constants as there are independent variables in the partial

differential equations; in the present case, tlierefore, four arbitrary con-

stants. But one of these constants may be taken to be a constant attached
to the function S by mere addition, and which disappears from the dif-
ferential coefficients, and it is only necessary to attend to the other three
arbitrary constants. S is consequently a function of t,x,y,z, and of the
Andarbitrary constants a, /3, y, satisfying the partial differential equation.
this being so, it is shown that the integrals of the problem are

                       a-=^nx,-^=my,^=mz,

                       dS_ dS_ dS_

                       d^-^'dji-^"' dy""'

where X, ju, v are any other arbitrary constants, viz., the first three equa-
tions give the intermediate integrals, and the last three equations give the

final integrals of tiie problem.

Jacobi proceeds to give an analogous definition of the principal function

V as follows :

 --35. Jacobi's principal function V. First, when the condition of vis viva

Vis satisfied. Here    is a complete solution of the partial differential

equation

where h is the constant of vis viva. The partial differential equation con-

tains only three independent variables ; and since as before one of the

constants of the complete solution may be taken to be a constant attached

Vto by mere addition, and which disaj)pears from the differential co-

Vefficients, we may consider as a function of t,x,y,z, and of the two con-

Vstants of integration a and /3. But  will of course also contain the

constant h, which enters into the partial differential equation. The integrals

of the problem are then shown to be

T=U +equation as  /<, but along with the coordinates x,y,z there is intro-

duced a new variable H, and V is defined to be a complete integral of the

partial differential equation

are, consequently, four independent variables, and a complete solution must

that the solution of the partial differential equation depends on the integra-

tion of a single system of partial diflPerential equations. The remainder of

the memoir is devoted to the discussion of this theorj' and of the integration

of the Pfaffian system of ordinary differential equations, a system which is

also treated of in Jacobi's memoir of 1844', ' Theoria Novi Multiplica-

toris,' &c. I take the opportunity of referring here to a short note by

Brioschi, ' Intorno ad una Proprieta delle Equazione alle Derivate Parziale

del Primo Ordine,' Tortolini, t. vi. pp. 426-429 (1855), where the theory

of the integration of a partial differential equation of the first order ia pre-

sented under a singularly elegant form.

 --38. Jacobi's note of 1837, 'On the Integration of the Differential Equa-

tions of Dynamics.' Jacobi remarks that it is possible to derive from

Lagrange's form of the equations of motion an important profit for the

integration of these equations, and he refers to his communication of the

29th of November 1839 to the Academy of Berlin, and to his former note
to the Academy of Paris. He proceeds to say, that whenever the condition

of vis viva holds good, he had found that it was possible in the integration

of the equations of motion to follow a course such that each of the given

integrals successively lowers by two unities the order of the system; and

that the like theorem holds good when the condition of vis viva is not satis-

fied, that is, when the force function involves the time (this seems to be a

restatement, in a more general form, of the theorems referred to in the note

of the 29th of November 1836 to the Academy of Berlin); and he men-

tions that he had been, by his researches on the theory of numbers, led

away from composing an extended memoir on the subject. The note then

passes on to other subjects, and it concludes with two theorems, which are

given without demonstration as extracts from the intended work he had

--before spoken of. These theorems are in effect as follows:

I. Let

                                                                         ^'-

  VLet be a complete solution of the partial differential equation

Vthat is, a solution containing, besides the constant attached to by mere
--addition, 3n 1 constants n(aj, a^... a3,,_j), then first the integral equa-

tions are

                                                                                      .

where /3(i(3p/32.../33,,_,) and r are new arbitrary constants: this is in fact
the theorem already quoted from Jacobi's memoir of 1837, and it is in the
present place referred to as an easy generalisation of Sir W. R. Hamilton's

thing essential which was known in reference to the integration of partial differential equa-
tions of the first order ; he refers also to his own memoir ' Ueher die Pfaffsche Methode,'
&c., Crelle, t. ii. pp. 347-358 (1827), as presenting the method in a more symmetrical and
compendious form, but without adding to it anything essentially new.

formulae. But Jacobi proceeds (and this is given as entirely new) that the
disturbed equations being

                d-x d\] do, dry dV da dPz rfU dD.

                    df dx dx' dt- dy dy' df dz dz

then the equations for the variations of the above system of arbitrary con-
stants are

                   dt~ da'" dt~ dh'

so that the constants form (I think the term is here first introduced) a

canonical system.

Jacobi observes, that in the theory of elliptic motion, certain elements

which he mentions, form a system of canonical elements, and he remarks,

that since one complete solution of a partial differential equation gives all
the others, the theorem leads to the solution of another interesting problem,
viz, " Given one system of canonical elements, to find all the other systems."

This is effected by means of the second theorem, which is as follows :

                   da^__dn        dft__dH

                   dt~ dft"" dt~ da'"'

Jacobi concludes with the remark, that other theorems no less general may

+be deduced by putting ;// X\^j+/x»^2+ · · · instead of ;//, and eliminating the

multipliers X, /x, . . by means of the equations \/'i=0 ,\p2^=0, . ., and that the
demonstrations of the theorems are obtained without difficulty.

  --39. Jacobi's note of the 21st of November, 1838. Jacobi refers to a

memoir by Encke in the Berlin ' Ephemeris' for 1837, ' iiber die Speciellen

Storungen,' where expressions are given for the partial differential coefficients

of the values in the theory of elliptic motion of the coordinates x,y, z and the

velocities x', y', z' with respect to the elements ; and he remarks, that if

Encke's elements are replaced by a system of elements a, ft, y, a', ft', y' which
he mentions, connected with those of Encke by equations of a simple form,

then considering first x,y, z, x',y', z' as given functions of t and the elements,

and afterwards the elements a, ft, y, a', ft', y' as given functions of t and
x,y,z, x',y',z', there exists the remarkable theorem that the thirty-six partial

x,y,z,.. of the different points of the system, these equations may contain
t, but they must not contain the differential coefficients x',y',z',.. The form
is a more general one than that considered by Lagrange and Poisson. The
memoir contains an elegant investigation of the variations of the elements of
the orbit of a body acted upon by a central force, the expressions for the

variations being obtained in a canonical form ; and there is also a discussion
of the problem suggested in Poisson's report of 1830 on the manuscript work
of Ostrogradslcy.

    43. Jacobi's note of 1842, in the ' Comptes Rendus,' announces the general
principle (being a particular case of the theorem of the ultimate multiplier)
stated and demonstrated in the memoir next referred to, and gives also the
rule for the formation of the multiplier in the case to which the general

principle applies.

   44. Jacobi's memoir of 1842, ' De Motu Puncti singularis': the author

remarks, that the greater the difficulties in the general integration of the
equations of dynamics, the greater the care which should be bestowed on
the examination of the dynamical problems in which the integration can be

reduced to quadratures; and the object of the memoir is stated to be the
examination of the simplest case of all, viz. the problems relating to the

motion of a single point. The first section, entitled, ' De Extensione quadam

Principii Viriumvi varum,' contains a remark which, though obvious enough,

is of considerable importance : the forces X, Y, Z which act upon a particle,

+may be such that Xdx+Ydy 7idz is not an exact differential, so that if the

particle were free, there would be no force function, and the equations of
motion would not be expressible in the standard form. But if the point
move on a surface or a curve, then in the former case Xdx-\-Ydy-\-Zdz

+will be reducible to the form Fdp Qdq, which will be an exact differential

if a single condition (instead of the three conditions which are required in
the case of a free particle) be satisfied, and in the latter case it will be
reducible to the form Fdp, which is, per se, an exact differential. In the

case of a surface, the requisite transformation is given by the Hamiltonian

form of the equations of motion, which Jacobi demonstrates for the case in
hand ; and then in the third section, with a view to its application to the
particular case, he enumerates the general proposition "quae pro novo prin-
cipio mechanico haberi potest," which is as follows :

   " Consider the motion of a system of material points subjected to anj
--24 REVORT 1857.

conditions, and let the forces acting on the several points in the direction of
the axes be functions of the coordinates alone: if the determination of the
orbits of the several points is reduced to the integration of a single differ-
ential equation of the first order between two variables, for this equation

there may be found, by a general rule, a multiplier which will render it
integrable by quadratures only."

   And for the particular case the theorem is thus stated :

and the demonstration of the theorem is given. The remainder of the
memoir, sections i to 7, is occupied by a very interesting discussion of
various important special problems.

special problem, I will merely refer to, viz. the memoir ' Sur 1' Elimination
des Noeuds dans le probleme des trois Corps,' Crelle, t. xxvii. pp. 115-131
(ISiS). The solution is made to depend upon six differential equations, all
of them of the first order except one, which is of the second order, and
upon a quadrature.

perties of the "multiplier" of a system of ordinary differential equations, or

 of a linear partial differential equation of the first order, with applications to
various systems of differential equations, and in particular to the differential

equations of dynamics. The definition of the multiplier is as follows, viz.

One of the properties of the multiplier is that contained in the theorem of
the ultimate multiplier, viz. that when all the integrals (except one) of the

system of partial differential equations are known, and the system is thereby

reduced to a single differential equation between two variables, then t^^

multiplier (in the ordinary sense of the word) of this last equation is MV,

Mwhere is the multiplier of the system, and V is a given derivative of the

known integrals, so that the multiplier of the system being known, the in-
tegration of the last differential equation is reduced to a mere quadrature.
To explain the theorem more particularly, suppose that the system of given

integrals, that is, all the integrals (except one) of the system are represented

byj9=a, 5'=/3, . . ., and let u, v be any two functions whatever of the variables,
so that jo, q,.,.u,v are in number equal to the system x, y, z, to, ... then if

the last differential equation takes the form

                          \]dv--'Wdu=0,

U Vwhere it is assumed that and are, by the assistance of the given in-

tegrals, expressed as functions of m, v and the constants of integration. The

Mmultiplier of the last-mentioned equation is MV, where is the multiplier

of the system, and V may be expressed in either of the two forms

                          _ ^(x,y,z,w,....)

                          'd{a,(i,             u,v)

and

                          ^}l'd{x,y,s,w,..

where the symbols on the right-hand sides represent functional determinants

in the first form it is assumed that x,y, z,w, . . are expressed as functions of
a, j3, . . zi, V, and in the second form that p,g,...u,v are expressed as func-

tions of x,y,s,w,..,, but that ultimately p,q,... are replaced by their
values in terms of the constants and u, v ; the first of the two forms, from its

not involving this transformation backwards, appears the more convenient.

   47. I have thought it worth while to quote the theorem in its general

form, but we may take for u, v any two of the original variables, and if, to

fix the ideas, it is assumed that there are in all the four variables x,y, z, w,

--then the theorem will be stated more simply as follows : given the system

of differential equations

                      dx-.dy.dz: dw=X : Y : Z : W,

and suppose that two of the integrals arep=:a,q=j3, the last equation to be

integrated will be

                          Wdz--Zdw=0,

where, by the assistance of the given integrals, W, Z are expressed as func-

Mtions of s, w. And the multiplier of this equation is MV, where is the

multiplier of the system, and V, attending only to the first of the two forms,

is given by the equation

                          _,, 5(a^>y)

                          ^ 9(a,/3)'

which supposes that x, y are expressed as functions of a, /3, z, w.

   48. Jacobi applies the theorem of the ultimate multiplier to the dif-
ferential equations of dynamics, considered first in the unreduced La-
grangian form, where the coordinates are connected by any given system of
equations of condition ; secondly, in the reduced or ordinary Lagrangian
form ; and, thirdlj', in the Hamiltonian form. The multiplier can be found
for the first two forms, and the expressions obtained are simple and elegant

but, as regards the third form, there is a further simplification : the multiplier

M of the system is equal to the unitj', and the multiplier of the last equation

is therefore equal to V. The two cases are to be distinguished in which t
does not, or does enter into the equations of motion ; in the latter case the
theorem furnished by the principle of the ultimate multiple is the same as

for the general case of a system, the multiplier of which is known, viz., the
theorem is, given all the integrals except one, the remaining integral can be
found by quadratures only. But in the former case, which is the ordinary

one, including all the problems in which the condition of vis viva is

satisfied, there is a further consequence deduced. In fact, the time t may

be separated from the other variables, and the system of differential equa-
tions reduced to a system not involving the time, and containing a number
of equations less by unity than the original system, and the theorem of the
ultimate multiplier applies to this new system. But when the integrals of
the new system have been obtained, the system may be completed by the
addition of a single diff'erential equation involving the time, and which is

integrable by quadratures ; the theorem consequently is, given all the
integrals except two, these given integrals being independent of the time,

the remaining integrals can be found by quadratures only. This is, in fact,
the ' Principium generale mechanicum' of the memoir of 1842.

   The last of the published writings of Jacobi on the subject of dynamics
are the ' Auszug zweier Schreiben des Professors Jacobi an Herrn Director

Hansen,' Crelle, t. xlii. pp. 12-31 (1851): these relate chiefly to Hansen's
theory of ideal coordinates.

   49. The very interesting investigations contained in sevei-al memoirs by
Liouville (' Liouville,' t. xi. xii. and xiv., and the additions to the ' Con-
naissance des Temps' for 1849 and 1850) in relation to the cases in which

the equations of motion of a particle or system of particles admit of integra-

tion, are based upon Jacobi's theory of the S Function, that is, of the function

which is the complete solution of a certain partial diff'erential equation of

the first order ; the equation is given, in the first instance, in rectangular

coordinates, and the author transforms it by means of elliptic coordinates

or otherwise, and he then inquires in what cases, that is, for M'hat forms of

Athe force function, the equation is one which admits of solution.  more

particular account of these memoirs does not come within the plan of the

present report.

   50. Desbove's memoir of 1848 contains a demonstration of the two
theorems given in Jacobi's note of 1837, in the ' Comptes Rendus;' and, as
the title imports, there is an application of the theory to the problem of the
planetary perturbations ; the author refers to the above-mentioned memoirs
of Liouville as containing a solution of the partial differential equation on
which the problem depends, and also to a memoir of his own relating to the
problem of two centres, where the solution is also given ; and from this
he deduces the solution just referred to, and which is employed in the

present memoir. Jacobi's theorem gives at once the formulae for the varia-
tion of the arbitrary constants contained in the solution. The material
thing is to determine the .signification of these constants, which can of
course be done by a comparison of the formulae with the known formulae of

elliptic motion ; the author is thus led to a sj'stem of canonical elements

similar to, but not identical with, those obtained by Jacobi.

 --51. Serret's two notes of 1848 in the ' Comptes Rendus.' These relate

to the theory of Jacobi's S function, that is, of the function considered as the

complete solution of a given partial differential equation of the first order.

In the first of the two notes, which relates to a single particle, the author

gives a demonstration founded on a particular choice of variables, viz.,

those which determine orthotomic surfaces to the curve described by the
moving point. The process appears somewhat artificial.

52. Sturm's note of 1848, in the ' Comptes Rendus,' relates to the theory

of Jacobi's S function, that is, of this function considered as the complete

solution of a given partial differential equation of the first order. The

force function is considered as involving the time t, which, however, is no

more than had been previously done by Jacobi.

 --53. Ostrogradsky's note of 1848. This contains an important step in the

theory of the forms of the equations of motion, viz.. it is shown how, in the

case where the force function contains the time, the equations of motion

may be transformed from the form of Lagrange to that of Sir W. R. Ha-

milton. If, as before, the force function (taken with the contrary sign to

+ U=ZTthat of Lagrange) is represented by U, then putting, as before,

V(the author writes instead of Z), in the case under consideration Z will

contain not only terms of the second order and terms of the order zero in the

differential coefficients of the coordinates q, .. ., but also terms of the first

+ +order, that is, Z will be of the form Z=Z2 Zi Zq, and putting H=Z2--Zq,
Hthis new function being expressed as a function of the coordinates q,..

and of the new variables j!?, .. ., then the equations of motion take the Ha-

miltonian form, viz.

In the theory of the transformation, as originally given by Sir W. R. Hamil-

ton, Z2=T, Z,=0, Zq=U, and, consequently, H=Z; -- Zq=T -- U as

before.

and with respect to the corresponding system of the mth order. The
system in question, which is, in fact, the general form of the system of
equations arising from a problem in the calculus of variations, had pre-
viously been treated of by Jacobi, but the theorem is probably new. In
conclusion, the author shows in a very elegant manner the interdependence

of the theorem relating to Lagrange's coefficients (a, b), and of the corre-
sponding theorem for the coefficients of Poisson.

   55. Bertrand's memoir of 1851, 'On the Integrals common to several

Mechanical Froljlems,' is one of great importance, but it is not very easy
to explain its relation to other investigations. The author remarks that,
given the integral of a mechanical proijlem, it is in general a question ad-
mitting of determinate solution to find the expression for the forces ; in
other words, to determine the problem which has given rise to the integral
at least, this is the case when it is assumed that the forces are functions of

the coordinates, without the time or the velocities ; and he points out how

the solution of the question is to be obtained. But, in certain cases, the
method fails, that is, it leads to expressions which are not sufficient for the
determination of the forces; these are the only cases in which the given
integral can belong to several different problems; and the method shows

the conditions necessary, in order that these cases may present themselves.
It is to be remarked that the given integral must be understood to be one

of an absolutely definite form, such for instance as the equations of the
conservation of the motion of the centre of gravity or of areas, but not such

as the equation of vis viva, which is a property common indeed to a

variety of mechanical problems, but which involves the forces, and is there-
fore not the same equation for different problems. The author studies in
particular the case where the system consists of a single particle ; he shows,
that when the motion is in a plane, the integrals capable of belonging to
two or more different problems are two in number, each of them involving

as a particular case the equation of areas. When the point moves on a

--surface, he arrives at the remarkable theorem " In order that the equa-

tions of motion of a point moving on a surface may have an integral inde-
pendent of the time, and common to two or more problems, it is necessary
that the surface should be a surface of revolution, or one which is develop-
able upon a surface of revolution." When the condition is satisfied, he gives
the form of the integral, and the general expression of" the forces in the
problems for which such integral exists. He examines, lastly, the general
case of a point moving freely in space. The number of integrals common to
several problems is here infinite. After giving a general form which com-
prehends them all, the author shows how to obtain as many particular
forms as may be desired : it is, in fact, only necessary to resolve any pro-
blem relative to motion in a plane, and to effect a certain simple trans-
formation on the integrals ; one thus obtains a new equation which is the
integral of an infinite number of different problems relating to the motion

in space."

   As an instance of the analytical forms on which these remarkable results

--depend, I quote the following, which is one of the most simple : " If an

integral of the equations of motion of a point in a plane belongs to two dif-
ferent problems, it is of the form

                                                              a='F(<j>',x,i/,t),

where 0' is the derivative with respect to t, of a function of x, y, which
equated to zero gives the equation of a system of right lines."

  --5^. Bertrand's memoir of 1851, ' On the Integration of the Differential

Equations of Dynamics.' The author refers to Jacobi's note of 1840, in
relation to Poisson's theorem ; and after remarking that there are very few
problems of which two integrals are not known, and which therefore might
not be solved by the method if it never failed ; he observes that unfor-
tunately there are (as was known) cases of exception, and that, as his me-
ON THEORETICAL DYNAMICS.  29

moir shows, these cases are far more numerous than those to which the
method applies; thus for example tl c equation of vis viva, combined with
any other integral whatever, leads to an illusory result. The theorem of
Poisson may lead to an illusory result in two ways ; either the resulting
integral may be an identity 0=0, or it may be an integral contained in the
integrals already known, and which consequently does not help the solu-
tion. It appears by the memoir that the two cases are substantially the
same, and that it is sufficient to study the case in which tiie two integrals
lead to the identity 0=0. Suppose that one integral is given, the author
shows that there always exist integrals which, combined with the given
integral, lead to an illusory result, and he shows how the integrals which,
combined with the given integral, lead to such illusory result, are to be
obtained. For instance, in the case of a body moving round a fixed centre,
there are here two known integrals ; first, the equation oi' vis viva (but this,
as already remarked, combined with any other integral whatever, leads to an

illusory result) ; secondly, the equation of areas.

   The question arises, what are the integrals which, combined with the
equation of areas, lead to an illusory result? The integrals in question
are, in fact, the other two integrals of the problem ; so that the inquiry into
the integrals which give an illusory result, leads here to the completion of
the solution. The like happens in two other cases which are considered,
viz. 1. the problem of two fixed centres, and the problem of motion i?i piano
when the forces are homogeneous functions of the coordinates of the degree.
2. Indeed the case is the same for all problems whatever, where the co-
ordinates of the points of the system can be expressed by means of two inde-
pendent variables.

    The next problem considered is that where two bodies attract each other,
and are attracted to a fixed centre. Suppose, first, the motion is in piano,
then as in the former case all the integrals will be found by seeking for
the integrals which, combined with the equation of areas, give an illusory

result. When the motion is in spa'ce, the principle of areas furnishes three

integrals (the equation of vis viva is contained in these three equations)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

the integrals which, combined with the integrals in question, give illusory
results, are eight in number, and, to complete the solution, there must be
added to these one other integral, which alone does not put the method in
default. The problem of three bodies is then shown to be reducible to the
last-mentioned problem ; and the same consequences therefore hold good
with respect to the problem of three bodies, viz., there are eight integrals
which, combined with the integrals furnished by the principle of areas, give
illusory results. To complete the solution it would be necessary to add to
these a ninth integral, which alone would not put the method into default.

    57. The author remarks that it appears by the preceding enumeration
that the method of integration, based on the theorem of Poisson, is far
from having all the importance attributed to it by Jacobi. The cases of
exception are numerous; they constitute, in certain cases, the complete
solutions of the problems, and embrace in other cases eleven integrals out
of twelve. But it would be a misapprehension of his meaning to suppose
that, according to him, the cases in which Poisson's theorem is usefully
applicable ought to be considered as exceptions. The expression would not
be correct even for the problems, which are completely resolved in seeking
for the integrals which put the method into default ; there exists for these
problems, it is true, a system of integrals which give illusory results ; but
these integrals, combined in a suitable manner, might furnish others to
which the theorem could be usefully applied.
30 llEPOBT-- 1857.

    The author remarks, that, in seeking the cases of exception to Poisson's
theorem, there is obtained a new method of integration, which may lead to
useful results ; and, after referring to Jacobi's memoir on the elimination of
the nodes in the problem of three bodies, he remarks that, by his own new
method, the problem is reduced to the integration of six equations, all of
them of the first order ; so that he effectuates one more integration than had
been done by Jacobi ; and he refers to a future memoir (not, I believe, yet
published) for the further development of his solution.

   58. To give an idea of the analytical investigations, the equations of
motion are considered under the Hamiltonian form

                           dq_dR dp__dH

                               dt~ dp'' dt~ dq'

Hwhere is any function whatever of §-, . . . ja, . . . without t, and then a given

integral being

                                         a=(l>{q,..p,...),

the question is shown to resolve itself into the determination of an integral

fi=^{q,  . . p,     . . .),  such  that  identically  (a,/3)=0  or  else (a,;3)=l, where
                 .

(a, /3) represents, as before, Poisson's symbol, viz.

if for shortness

                                   S(a,/3) _da d^_da dfi

                                   ^(q, jo) dq dp dp dq

The partial differential equations (a, /3)=0 or(a, ^)=1, satisfied by cer-
tain integrals /3, are in certain cases, as Bertrand remarks, a precious method

of integration leading to the classification of the integrals of a problem, so

as to facilitate their ulterior determination : it is in fact by means of them
that the several results before referred to are obtained in the memoir.

 --b%. Bertrand's note of 1852 in the ' Comptes Rendus.' This contains the

demonstration of a theorem analogous to Poisson's theorem (a, /3)=const.,
but the function on the left-hand side is a function involving four of the
arbitary constants and binary combinations of pairs of corresponding vari-

ables, instead of two arbitrary constants and the series of pairs of corre-
sponding variables.

    60. Bertrand's notes, vi. and vii,, to the third edition of the ' M^canique
Analytique,' 1853, contain a concise and elegant exposition of various
theorems which have been considered in the present report. The latter of
the two notes relates to the above-mentioned theorem of Poisson, and places
the theorem in a very clear light, in fact, establishing its connexion with the
theory of canonical integrals. Bertrand in fact shows, that, given any in-
tegral a of the differential equations (in the last-mentioned form, the whole
number of equations being 1K), then the solution may be completed by
joining to the integral a a system of integrals /3i, ^.2---ftzk-\'> which, com-
bined with the integral «, give to Poisson's equation an identical form, viz.
which are such that

                  = a(a,/3,,)=l («,/3,)=0,...(o,/3,,_,)

This, he remarks, shows, that, given any integral a, the solution of the pro-

blem may be completed by integrals /3i,/3o... /^a^-i, which, combined with
a, give all of them an identical form to the theorem of Poisson. But it is

not to be supposed that all the integrals of the problem are in the same case.

contains reflections and developments in relation to Bertrand's method of

integration and to canonical systems of integrals, but I do not perceive that

any new results are obtained.

   The note, ' Intorno ad un Teorema di Meccanica,' contains a demonstration
of the theorem in Bertrand's note of 1852 in the ' Comptes Rendus,' and an
extension of the theorem to the case of a combination of any even number
of the arbitrary constants ; the value of the symbol is shown by the theory
of determinants to be a function of the Poissonian coefficients (a, /3), and as

these are constants, the value of the symbol considered is also constant.

62. Liouville's note of the 29th of June, 1853*, contains the enunciation

of a theorem which completes the investigations contained in Poisson's

memoir of 1837. The equations considered are the Hamiltonian equations

Hin their most general form, viz., is any function whatever of t and the

other variables : it is assumed that half of the integrals are known, and that

the given integrals are such that for any two of tiiem a, /3, Poisson's coeffi-

cient (a, /3) is equal to zero ; this being so, the expression pdq+ ... --Hdt,

where, by means of the known integrals, the variables jo, . . are expressed in

terms o( q, . . . t, is a complete differential in respect to q,.. .t, viz. it will be

the differential of Sir W. R. Hamilton's principal function V, which is thus

determined by means of the known integrals, and the remaining integrals are

then given at once by the general theory.

Poisson, Sir W. R. Hamilton, and Jacobi, and he remarks that his own
investigations do not pretend to make any important step in advance. The

investigations contained in section 1, articles 1 to 14, establish by an inverse

process (that is, one setting out from the integral equations) the chief con-

clusions of the theories of Sir W. R. Hamilton and Jacobi, and in particular

those relating to the canonical system of elements as given by Jacobi's

theory. The theorem (3), article 1, which is a very general property of
functional determinants, is referred to as probably new. The most im-

portant results of this portion of the memoir are recapitulated in section 4,
in the form of seven theorems there given without demonstration ; some of
these will be presently again referred to. Articles 17 and 18 contain, I

believe, the only demonstration which has been given of the equivalence of
the generalised Lagrangian and Hamiltonian systems. The transformation

is as follows : the generalised Lagrangian system is

the note is only published in Liouville's Journal in the May Number for 1855, which is
subsequent to the date of the second part of Professor Donkin's memoir in the ' Philosophical

    In section 2, articles '21 and 22, there is an elegant demonstration, by

means of the Hamiltonian equations, of the theorem in relation to Poisson's

coefficients (a,b), viz., that these coefficients are functions of the elements

only. And there are contained various developments as to the consequences

of this theorem ; and as to systems of canonical, or, as the author calls
them, normal elements. The latter part of the section and section 3,
relate principally to the special problems of the motion of a body under the
action of a central force, and of the motion of rotation of a solid body.

  --6^. Part II. (sections 4, 5, 6 and 7, articles 49-93, appendices). Section

4 contains the seven theorems before referred to. Although not given as
new theorems, yet, to a considerable extent, and in form and point of view,
they are new theorems.

   Theorem 1 is a theorem standing apart from the others, and which is used
in the demonstration of the transformation from the Lagrangian to the

XHamiltonian system. It is as follows : viz., if be a function of the n vari-

ables a:,..., and ify, ... be n other variables connected with these by the
n equations

                                                       rfX

                                      -d^-y-"

then will the values of x, . . ., expressed by means of these equations in
terms of y, . . ., be of the form

                                               _rfY

and if/> be any other quantity explicitly contained in X, then also

                                     dX dY

the differentiation with respect to p being in each case performed only so

far as jo appears explicitly in the function.

  The value of Y is given by the equation

                                Y=-X+X7/+...

where, on the right-hand side, x,... are expressed in terms of y, . .
   Theorems 2, 3 and 4, and a supplemental theorem in article 50, relate to

the deduction of the generalised Hamiltonian system of differential equa-
tions from the integral equations assumed to be known. In fact (writing
y, q,.. . p, . .. b,... a, . . ., instead of the author's X, a:, . . . a;,,, y, . . . y,,,

Va, . . . a,,, ^1 . . . 5,,), it is assumed that is a given function of t, of the n va-

liables g, . . ., and of the n constants b, . . ., and that the n variables p, ...,
and the n constants a,.,., are determined by the conditions

                            g=,,....(.)

so that in fact by viitiie of these 2m equations the 2w variables X, q, . .
p,... may be considered as functions of t, and the 2n constants h, . . . a, . .
(hypothesis l), or conversely, the 2m constants b, . . . a,..., may be con-

sidered as functions of t and of the 2m variables q, .. . p,. . . (iiypothesis 2).
    Theorem 2 is as follows: viz., if from the 2m equations (1,2^ and their

total differential coefficients with respect to t, tiie 2m constants be elimi-
nated, there will result the following 2m simultaneous differential equations

of the first order, viz. :

                            dq_ dH
                                          "

                            dt dq

Hwhere  is a function of q, . . . p, . . . (which will in general also contain t

explicitly), and is given by the equation

                                 dV

d--Vwhere, on the right-hand side, the differential coefficient  is taken with

Vrespect to t, in so far as t appears explicitly in the original expression for

in terms of y, ...&,.. . and i, and after the differentiation, b, .. ., are to be
expressed in terms of the variables and t, by means of the equations (I).

   Theorem 3 is, that there exists the following relations, viz. :

                            dq da dq db

                            db~  dp' da~                   '

   To these theorems should be added the supplemental theorem contained

in article 50, viz., that there subsists also the system of equations

    In theorem 4 the author's symbol (i?, <?) has a signification such as
Poisson's (a, b), and if we write as before

(this refers of course to hypothesis 2), the theorem is, that the following
equations subsist identically, viz., b,a being corresponding constants out of
the two series b,... and a, . . ,, then

                                      (b,a)=-(a,b)=l,

but that for any other pairs b, a, or for any pairs whatever b, b or a, a, the

=0corresponding symbol       : in fact, that the constants b, , . . and a, . . . form

a canonical system of elements.

Theorem 5 is a theorem including theorem 4, and relating to any two

functions u, v either of the two 2« constants or else of the 2w variables,

and which may besides contain t explicitly ; it establishes, in fact, a relation

between Poisson's coefficient (m, v) and the corresponding coefficient of

Lagrange.

Theorem 6      is  as  follows : viz,,  p,li q, . . .  . ..  are   any 2w  variables  con-

cerning which no supposition is made, except that they are connected by

the n equations

                             b-f{q,...p,...),

which equations are only subject to the condition of being sufficient for the

determination  of j9, . . .  in terms   ando^ q, . . .  a, . . ,,  and  they may contain

explicitly any other quantities, for example, a variable t. Then, in order

tions (pi, bj)=0 may be satisfied identically.
   Theorem 7 is, in fact, the theorem previously established in its general

form in Liouville's note of the 29th of June, 1853, viz., if, of the system of
2w differential equations

the elements considered in relation to the following very general problem
viz., Q, ... P, ... being any functions whatever of the 2n variables q,...
J9, ... and t; it is required to express the integrals of the system 2« dif-

by substituting functions of t for the constant elements of the latter system.
And section 6 contains some very general researches on the general pro-
blem of the transformation of variables, a problem of which, as the author
remarks, the method of the variation of elements is a particular, and not
the only useful case. In particular, the author considers what he terns
a normal transformation of variables, and he obtains the theorem 8, which
includes as a particular case the second of the two theorems in Jacobi s
note of 1837, in the ' Comptes Rendus.' This theorem is as lollows:
viz., if the original variables ^, . . p, . . . are given by the 2n equations

                               dq_(m ^__^.
                               di~ dp' dt                                                 '

and if the new variables r,, ... cr, ... are connected with the original vari-

ables by^ the equations        dK dK

then will the transformed equations be

and is to be expressed in terms of the new variables, the substitution of the

^new variables in  being made after the differentiation. In particular, if

K ^=0does not contain t explicitly, then                                          $=H,and    so that, in this case,

equations are symbolically, but not actually, in the Hamiltonian form,

Hviz., where the function  is considered as containing functions of q, ·· ·

p,... which are exempt from differentiation in forming the differential

equations (the author calls this a pseudo-canonical system), and where, in

like manner, the transformation of variables is a pseudo-normal transforma-

tion ; the theorems 10 and 11 relate to this question, which is treated still
more generally in Appendix C. The general methods are illustrated by

applications to the problem of three bodies and the problem of rotation ;
the former problem is specially discussed in section 7 ; but the results ob-
tained (and which, as the author remarks, affords an example of the so-

called ' elimination of the nodes') do not come within the plan of the pre-

sent report.

 --66. Bour's memoir of 1855, 'On the Integration of the Differential

Equations of Analytical Mechanics.' It has been already seen that the

knowledge of half of the entire system of the integrals of the differential

equations (thfse known integrals satisfying certain conditions) leads by

quadratures only to the knowledge of the remaining integrals ; the re-
searches contained in this most interesting and valuable memoir show that

this theorem is, in fact, only the last of a series of theorems, here first

established, relating to the successive reduction which results from the

knowledge of each new integral. Speaking in general terms, it may be

stated that the author operates on the linear partial differential equation of

the first order, which is satisfied by the integrals of the differential equa-

tions ; and that he effectuates upon this equation a reduction of two unities
in the number of variables for every suitable new integral which is ob-

tained*. The author shows also that an equal or greater reduction may

think, be more accurate to say, for every suitable new integral after the first one ; in the
case considered in the memoir, the condition of vis viva is satisfied, and there is always one
integral, the equation of vis viva, which is known ; but this alone, and in the general case
the first known integral, will not cause a reduction of two unitiei.

to his method. Before going further, it maj^ be convenient to remark that

Hthe author restricts himself to the case in which is independent of the

time, and wliere, consequently, the condition of vis viva is satisfied ; it was,
however, remarked by Liouville that the analysis, slightly modified, applies

Hto the most general case where is any function of t and the variables, and

it is possible that when the entire memoir is published (it is given in ' Liou-

ville's Journal' as an extract), the theory will be exhibited under this more

general form.

under the ibrm

therefore, of representation in the canonical form «, /3, Oj, a^, . . . a^n-z

tion (1) replaces the original differential equations; it is to the equation (1)

that the theorems of Poisson and Bertrand may be supposed to be applied,

and it is this equation (1) which is studied in the memoir, where it is
shown how the order may be diminished when one or more integrals are

known.

expressed in terms of the other variables and of o. The author remarks

that it will happen, what causes the success of the method, that this opera-

tion, the object of which is to get rid of the solution Z^=H, conducts to two

which is precisely similar to the equation (1) (only the number of variables
is diminished by two unities), and is possessed of the same properties. Its

integrals are a^,a.,,a^...a2n-2j which are all of them integrals of the pro-

blem, and give (oj, Oi)=0. And the theorems of Poisson and Bertrand

apply equally to this equation ; the only difference is, that the number of

Aterms in the expressions (a, /3) is less by two unities.      new integral (og)

leads in like manner to an equation (8) similar to (5), but with the number

of variables further diminished by two unities, and so on, until the half

series of integrals a,a^,o.^..,a.2n-3 are known; the conjugate integrals

/3, 02,04... a2«-2 are then obtained by quadratures only, in the method ex-
plained in the memoir, and which is in fact identical with tliat given by the

theorem of Liouville and Donkin. Tlie memoir contains other results,

which have been already alluded to in a general manner ; some of these are

made use of by the author in his ' Memoire sur les problemes des trois

former of them, r, equal to ^-|- constant, so that

tion is an elegant and valuable one, but it is not in anywise to be inferred
that there is any advantage in considering the particular case (which is thus
shown to be capable of including the general one), rather than the general
one itself: such inference does not seem to be intended, and would, I think,
be a wrong one.

   69. Brioschi's note of 1855 contains an elegant demonstration (founded
on the theory of skew determinants) of a property which appears to be a
new one, of the canonical integrals of a dynamical problem, viz. if q,p stand
for a corresponding pair of the variables q,...p,... then

where the summation refers to all the different pairs of conjugate integrals
a, (3 of the canonical system, the pair q,p in the denominator being the same
in each term ; but if tlie variables in the denominator are a non-corresponding
pair out of the two series q, . . and jo, . . ., or else a pair out of one series only
(that is, both ^-'s or both jo's), then the expression on the left-hand side is
equal to zero. This is in fact a sort of reciprocal theorem to the theorem
which defines the canonical system of integrals. There are two or three
memoirs of Brioschi in Crelle's Journal connected with this note and tiie
note of 1853 ; but as they relate professedly to skew determinants and not to
the equations of dynamics, it is not necessary here to refer to them more

particularly.

   70. Bertrand's memoir of 1857 forms a sequel to the memoir of 1651, on
the integrals common to several problems of mechanics. The author calls
to mind that he has shown in the first memoir, that, given an integral of a
mechanical problem, and assuming only that the forces are functions of the
coordinates, it is possible to determine the problem and find the forces which
act upon each point ; and (he proceeds) it is important to remark, that the

--solution leads often to contradictory results, that, in fact, an equation as-

sumed at hazard is not in general an integral of any problem whatever of
the class under consideration : and he thereupon proposes to himself in the
present memoir to develope some of the consequences of this remark, and to
seek among the most simple forms, the equations which can present them-
selves as integrals, and the problems to which such integrals belong. The
various special results obtained in the memoir are interesting and valuable.

   71. In what precedes I have traced as well as I have been able the series
of investigations of geometers in relation to the subject of analytical dyna-
mics. The various theorems obtained have been in general stated with
sufficient fulness to render them intelligible to mathematicians; the attempt
to state them in a uniform notation and systematic order would be out of the

--province of the present report. The leading steps are, first, the establish-

ment of the Lagrangian form of the equations of motion ; secondly, La-

grange's theory of the variation of the arbitrary constants, a theory perfectly
complete in itself; and it would not have been easy to see a priori that it
would be less fruitful in results than the theory of Poisson ; thirdly, Poisson's
theory of the variation of the arbitrary constants, and the method of inte-

gration thereby afibrded ; fourthly. Sir W. R. Hamilton's representation of

the integral equations by means of a single characteristic function deter-
minable a jtjosferion by means of the integral equations assumed to be known,
or by the condition of its simultaneous satisfaction of two partial differential

equations ; fifthly. Sir W. R. Hamilton's form of the equations of motion

equation, and the general theory of the connexion of the integration of a
system of ordinary differential equations, and of a partial differential equa-
tion of the first order, a theory, however, of which Jacobi can only be con-
sidered as the second founder; seventhly, the notion (arising from the
researches of Lagrange and Poisson) and ulterior development of the theory
of a system of canonical integrals.

    I remark in conclusion, that the differential equations of dynamics (in-
cluding in tiie expression, as I have done throughout tiie repoit, the gene-
ralized Lagrangian and- Hamiltouian forms) are only one of the classes of
differential eqiialions which have occupied the attention of geometers. The
greater part of what has been done with respect to the general theory of a
system of differential equations is due to Jacobi, and he has also considered
in particular, besides the differential equations of dynamics, the Pfaffian
system of differential equations (including therein the system of differential
equations which arise from any partial differential equation of the first order),
and the so-called isoperimelric system of differential equations, that is, tiie
system arising from any problem in the calculus of variations. In a sys-
tematic treatise it would be proper to commence with the general theory of
a system of differential equations, and as a branch of this general theory, to
consider the generalized Ilamiitonian system, and in relation thereto to
develope the various theorems which have a dynamical application. It
would be shown that the generalized Lagrangian form could be transformed
into the Hamiltonian form, but the first-mentioned form would, I think,
properly be treated as a particular case of the isoperimetric system of dif-
ferential equations.

           ON THE GROWTH AND VITALITY OF SEEDS.                                   43

Sixteenth and final Report of a Committee, consisting of Professor

   Daubeny, Professor Henslow, and Professor Lindley, ap-

   pointed to continue their Experiments on the Grotvth and Vitality

    of Seeds.

When the summary, given in the Report for 1850, pp. 162 to 168, was

made up, many of the kinds of seeds set apart for the continuation of these
experiments had not ceased to germinate, which rendered a continuation of
periodical sowings necessary to arrive at a satisfactory result. Such sowings
have consequently been continued down to the present tune, and so few*
are now found to possess their vegetative powers, that it is deemed necessary
to consider the object attained, and thus close these investigations.

    The Committee submit the annexed General Summary, which contains
all the results arrived at that are worth recording in this place.

    Single sowings of a great many other kinds of seeds, mostly old, have
·been made during the time these experiments have been carried on; but as
in most cases the probable age at which they ceased to germinate could not
be traced, thej' are not inserted in the summary, but will be found entered
in the MS. Register submitted with this Report.

Continuation of Report on Steam Navigation at Hull. By James
                       Oldham, C.E. Hull, M.I.C.E.

On the occasion of the Meeting of the British Association at Hull in 1853,

I had the honour of reading a short paper " On the Rise, Progress, and present

Position of Steam Navigation at Hull," and thinking that a continuation of

the subject might be interesting to the Association, to show the increase or

advance which has taken place since 1853, I have prepared a second Report

as a Supplement, which I beg now to present, but as it consists chiefly of

Tables of Statistics, 1 shall only read to you the summary of the Tables, com-

paring them with those of 1853 ; before doing so, however, I will just refer

myto one other point introduced in      former paper, I allude to the facilities

offered in the Port of Hull to iron ship-building. I then called upon ship-

owners of tiiat Port to encourage their fellow-townsmen in this important

branch of art, and the result has been, that, since the Meeting of 1853, about

fifty-six iron ships have been launched and completed, and by the end of the

present year that number will be increased to sixty iron vessels of various

descriptions, which will have been built in Hull by two houses, viz. Messrs,

--Charles and William Earle, and Messrs. Martin Samuelsou and Co., in about

four years, varying in tonnage from about 1600 downwards, but producing

an aggregate of about 27,000 tons burthen. Several of the above were built

for other British Ports, and some for foreign Companies. The result is

highly encouraging, and although a mere fraction of what has been effected

throughout the United Kingdom, yet it illustrates the spirit which animates

the determined and onward movement of commercial enterprise. Our

builders too have made rapid improvements in both ships and machinery,

and have proved, that, by following out the principles laid down by Mr. Scott

Russell, the results will always be satisfactory. 1 may mention as a proof of this

remark, that in one case a steam-ship of upwards of 1100 tons register, and

only of 135 nominal horse-power, has made the passage from Cronstadt to

Hull with a full cargo of goods, of upwards of 1500 tons weight, in 5^ days.
   It will be seen by the summary of the Tables of Statistics, compared with

--1853, that there is under each head, except one, that of B, a great increase

of steam shipping, viz. A gives an increase of 10,564 tons and 2755 horse-

power.                        B a decrease of 1317 tons, and a decrease of 733 horse-power;

but this is chiefly owing to some of the steamers having been placed in the

Dlist B, when they ought to have been in list of 1853.                       C gives an in-

crease of 15,363 tons and of 3066 horse-power.            D gives an increase of

1275 tons and of 676 horse-power.

The total number of steamers, leaving out several tugs and other boats,

but some of which were included in 1853, has increased from 81 to 131.

The total increase in tonnage is 25,885, and of horse-power 5764.

                                 Tables of Statistics.

   The following Tables show the present position of Hull in regard to the steamers which

--belong to, or trade from the Port : (A.) Sea-going steamers belonging to the port. Total

tonnage, 19,841 ; horse-power, 5554; averaging 3'57 tons per horse-power.                                                                           (B.) River

steamers belonging to the port.  Total  tonnage,  901  ;  horse-power, 402                                                                          averaging   2-24
                                                                                                                                                 ;

tons per horse-power.         (C.) Sea-going steamers belonging to other ports, but trading to

Hull. Tonnage, 21,272; horse-power, 5302; averaging 4-01 tons per horse-power.

(D.) River steamers belonging to other ports, but trading to Hull. Total tonnage, 2431

horse-power, 1102 ; averaging 2-20 tons per horse-power.

The total number of steamers trading to Hull amounts to 131, of the aggregate burthen

of 44,445 tons, and 12,360 horse-power; averaging on the whole 3*60 tons per horse-

power                         giving also an average on the total number of steamers of 339"198                                                     tons each.

Report of a Committee, consisting of The Rt. Hon. Earl of Hard-
   wiCKE, Chairman; Mr. Andrew Henderson, Mr. John Scott
   Russell, Mr. James Robt. Napier, Mr. Charles Atherton,
   Mr. Arthur Anderson, Rev. Dr. Woolley, Admiral Moor-
   SOM (vice Mr. W. Mann), Mr. John Macgregor (vice Mr. G. F.
   Young), Captain J. O. Owen, Professor Bennett Woodcroft,
   James Perry, and Mr. James Yates, Secretary, appointed to

   inquire into the Defects of the present methods of Measuring and
   Registering the Tonnage of Shipping, as also of Marine Engine-
   Power, and to frame more perfect rules, in order that a correct and
   uniform j^rinciple may be adopted to estimate the Actual Carrying
    Capabilities and Working-Poiver of Steam Ships^.

The Committee, having held its sittings weekly, for the purposes of in-

quiry and the reception of information, beg leave to present the following
Report :

   Your Committee think it necessary, at the outset, to state the difficulties
they met with (incidental, no doubt, to all private committees that attempt

to inquire into laws affecting particular classes) in inducing individuals to
appear before them to give evidence on this subject, or to give information
by writing or correspondence.

   The chief information now derived is from members of the Committee,

who, being personally interested in the subject, were naturally biassed in
their views by the circumstances that surround them.

   The mode, therefore, your Committee thought it best to adopt, for the
purpose of eliciting information, was that of circulating the annexed letter
(see No. I. in Appendix), specially referring to eight points of inquiry bear-
ing on the subjects.

   Copies of this Circular were sent to the Admiralty, Navy Board, Board of
Trade, Custom House, and Treasury, with a request that copies might be
forwarded to the vai'ious Officers under Government connected with the
scientific and working departments.

   Your Committee received from all the Government Departments a refusal
to forward those questions.

   Copies of the Circular were also sent to all the Local Marine Boards, to
the offices of the public newspapers, at shipping ports, and to many gentle-
men connected with science and trade.

   The Local Marine Boards declined to entertain the question.
   Answers were returned from several individuals, including members of
your Committee.
   Your Committee proceed to give a short summary of the replies, which
they received from their own members, and which are inserted in the
Appendix.
   Mr. John Scott Russell considers the object of registered tonnage is the
taxation of their contents ; the present is a mere standard of taxation ! that
all tonnage dues should be abandoned, and the same should be levied on

freight.

   For scientific purposes, he considers that the register tonnage measurement

--cannot be of any service does not consider that it would be tolerated, that

                                                * See Report for 1856, p. 458.
ON THE MEASUREMEMT OP SHIPS FOR TONNAGE.  63

lines of construction and scientific calculations should be demanded to be
given up under an Act of Parliament.

    Considers (on tlie question of steam power) that it would be neither politic

nor expedient to attempt to define power in a form more absolute than the

nature of the subject practically admits.

   The results of his reflections are, that nothing is necessary to be now done
except to rectify the allowance for engine room, which remains fictitious and

arbitrary.

   Dr. WooUey thinks it hopeless to look for information from legislative

enactments that would be useful in a scientific point of view.

    Thinks that in the levying of dues on shipping it is impossible to devise a
general rule fairer than that which is now in force.

   Does not think the public much interested in the question.
    Does not doubt that the more science is brought to bear in shipbuilding

the greater will be the economy, both as regards the first cost and the
management of vessels ; and owners will consequently be able to charge a
lower price for carrying goods and passengers.

    Considers that an enforced registration should have for its object

   1st. To secure a fairness in levying Government dues,
   2ndly. To give a fair idea of the amount of tonnage or roomage employed

for mercantile purposes.

    Thinks the present registration sufficient for merely statistical pur-

poses.

    Thinks the present law makes too great a difference between steamers and

 sailing ships.

    Sees no valid reason for making distinctions based on the difl^erent mate-
rials of which ships are built, or making discriminative distinctions between
vessels based on the difl^erent principles of machinery with which they may
be fitted.

   He agrees with Mr. Napier in thinking an enforced registration of engine-

power needless.

    Mr. James Robert Napier considers the objects of registration to be the
levying of dues, and simplifying the process of transferring the property
from one owner to another.

    Thinks the present system of tonnage measurement is more minute than
is necessary, and of little or no use to the shipbuilder ; is inclined to take
Mr. Russell's view of the subject, and not limit the load-draft of water.

    Does not see any reason for making a distinction between vessels built of
wood or iron.

     Considers nominal horse-power a useless terrtl. Instead of nominal horse-
power, he would substitute simply the capacity of the cylinders, or area of
 cylinders, multiplied by length of stroke. This would be positive informa-
 tion, and would be useful in buying and selling, and might be inserted in
 the registry of a vessel.

    Thinks a legal standard of power would remove some confusion which at

 present exists.

    Mr. Atherton considers that the present registration of shipping, as re-
 spects tonnage and nominal horse-power, affords no definite measure of
 quantity, either as to ship or engines, available for judging of the relative
 capabilities of steam ships.

     Thinks the statistics of trade, based on the present expression of "ton-
 nage," does not indicate the amount of trade, as respects the weight of goods
 conveyed.

   Considers that there is no constant ratio between " Tms Burden " and
--64 REPORT 1856.

" To7is Begister," and the capability for carrying tons weight of cargo ; and
therefore the present official registration does not fulfil the advertising
requirements of trade.

   Considers that no definition of tonnage, and no mode of determining it,
can adequately embrace both the capability of a ship for carrying weight and
its capacity lor holding hulk. The weight-tonnage and the bulk-tonnage
must therefore be distinct.

    Considers that, as the present scheme of registration does not set forth
any of the principal dimensions, as length, breadth, and depth, or the load-
line-draught, or give the displacement either at light-draught when rea<ly to
receive cargo, or at tlie load-draught or submerging-draught, it cannot, on
any definite principle, constitute the base of scientific inquiry into the com-
parative displacement and consequent dynamic performances and merits of
ships, nor a reliable base for statistical inquiry into the imports and exports
of the country.

   Does not consider that the science of naval -architecture would be in-
terfered with by the constructor's deep draught of water forward and
aft, or some regulation limit to be assigned as such, being made an item
in the official registration of every ship, and duly marked on the ship

herself.

   Considers that, in forming a rule for placing this mark to regulate the
freeboard limit, an investigation into existing practice (as to the ratio which
actually exists between the freeboard and the length, breadth, and depth of the
hull^ will be the best means of deducing a rule for determining the position
of the mark in question. Proposes a rule to exemplify this method of deter-
mining the freeboard limit.

    Considers that, if the registration be based on admeasurements compre-
hensively adequate for deducing therefrom the iveight-tonnage and hulk-
tonnage, then no occasion will exist for discriminative protection in favour
of any particular class of vessel, whether sailing-ship or steamer, or descrip-

tion of material with which a ship may be built, or systems of machinery by
which ships may be propelled.

    Considers the present registration of engine-power a delusion, because no
definite measure of power has been assigned, either by the legislature or by
the practice of trade, to the term " Nominal Horse-power," as indicating the
working-power of marine engines.

    Considers that a legalized unit of horse-power is a requirement only of
secondary importance to a comprehensive tonnage registration.

    Considers there can be no objection to a system prescribed by law, whereby
ships are to be measured for tonnage registration, to include their capability
for carrying weight, in addition to the bulk-tonnage prescribed by the pre-
sent law, and considers that all official admeasurements should be made on
one uniform principle, to be sanctioned by scientific authority. Shows that
weight-tonnage would assimilate closely with metrical tonnage.

   Admits Sterling's rule, as prescribed for the measurement of ships, by the
Act of 185t, to be based on strictly scientific principles, but regards its
practical application as inconvenient, and not self-detective of error, and a

pirating of the lines of ships.

    Considers Mr. Peake's system, for various reasons stated, as the best for
common use in determining cubical admeasurements, whereby the roomage
and tonnage of a ship may be ascertained and registered, without affording

data for pirating tlie constructor's lines.

    INIr. Henderson states the objects of registering tonnage; gives a table
that shows the mode that has been in use, and the measurements for ascer-

taining displacements at certain specified draughts that are in addition
desirable gives a proposed form of certificate.

                                         ;

    Considers the plan of measurement (at present used under the Act of 1854)
practically inefficient for obtaining a correct mensuration of vessels, in con-
sequence of equal divisions not being ahvaj's attainable.

    Considers that, to obviate certain defects (stated in his paper given in the
Appendix, No. 6), all measurements, besides that of the measuring officers,
should be attested by the builder and owner, &c.

    Considers that, after a trial of two years, the present tonnage measure-
ment and registration system has proved deficient and non-eflfective for the
attainment of most of the objects of public utility which registration ought

to afford.

    Gives a comparison of four modes of measurement, on paper ruled to a
scale, i inch to a foot, for facilitating the process of admeasurement.

    Thinks tliat the book of instructions given to measuring surveyors should
contain practical directions and diagrams of each of these four modes of
measurement.

    Thinks that the measuring officers should be shipbuilders or nautical men,
experienced in taking measurements.

    Admiral Moorsom is of opinion that every vessel should incur a penalty

which is loaded so as to sink below a certain draught of water.
    That her registered tonnage should comprise the weight of water between

her assigned load-draught and that draught which she would have when fit
for sea, with crew and stores and everything on board, except that by which

she earns her freight.

   He proposes a plan for obtaining the results required for registra-

tion*.

    Considers that the public have great concern in the improvement of
engines, and improvement can make but slow and fitful progress when the
poiuer exerted and power given out are not known.

    Considers that any measure of power must be incomplete without the
weight of fuel which is the originator of the power, and in any general
system for the registration of engine capability we must include the con-
structive details of the boiler as well as the cylinder.

    Such an expression would mean a given weight moved through a certain
space in a certain time with a certain weight of coal.

   Admiral Moorsom forwarded also a pamphlet, by himself, bearing on this
subject, which will be found in the Appendix.

    Mr. James Yates shows the points of agreement between the party, as
represented by Mr. Moorsom, Registrar-General of Tonnage, and that repre-
sented by those who consider the present sj-stem of registration imperfect.
Recommends the adoption of the " Metrical Ton " as the base of a ship's

registered tonnage.

   The foregoing is a brief summary of the answers given to the eight
questions circulated by your Committee, which were received from mem-
bers of the said Committee, and will be found in the Appendix to this

Report.

    Letters from Mr. James Peake and Admiral Laws, bearing on the subject,
were received.

    That from Mr. Peake gives a full explanation of his method of calcu-
lating the tonnage of ships, both internally and externally.

    Your Comjiiittee have also received answers from gentlemen connected
with Science and Trade to the effect, as follows:

       * Appendix, No. 7.

1857.                      »
--66 REPORT 1857.

    Mr. Mansel considers that the registration of the carrying capability of a
vessel should be viewed in reference to weight alone, and is strictly propor-
tional to her external volume between the load and light-draught water-lines,
but has no definite relation to the capacity inside of the inner lining.

    Considers that, at the commencement, the desire to foster the growth of
steam-shipping led to the adoption of a discriminating tonnage, to an extent
injurious towards sailing vessels, and erroneous in principle.

    Considers that the capacity sacrificed to fuel alone ought to have been
exempted from dues.

    Thinks that the difference between the displacement at the light-draMght
and the displacement at the /ocrrf-draught, would be the weight-carrying
capability of the ship for cargo and stores, in the case of a sailing vessel, and
for cargo, fuel, and stores, in the case of a steam-ship ; and that it is impe-
rative that this difference should be registered, even though it might not be
taken as the basis for levying dues.

    Considers that the present law for measuring ships is objectionable, inas-

much that it does not directly imply the external volume of the vessel upon
which the carrying capability, cost of construction, and propulsion, directly

depend. Also, supposing equal strength, it is our interest that the difference
between the external and internal volume shall be a minimum. At present,
with equal displacement, the vessel with this difference greatest pays least
dues, and thus an indirect premium is given to the worst ship. Again, tlie

method of allowing engine deduction is still more objectionable, for if we
afill certain portion of the internal volume with an inefficient mechanism,
we get the same deduction from gross tonnage, as if the same portion of
the same vessel had been filled with the most perfect mechanism, working
up to a much greater power, to the disadvantage of the better mechanised

ship.

    Considei's that nominal horse-power implies a certain area of piston moving
through a certain space, &c. Indicated horse-power has no very definite
relation to the above. The fii'st represents more nearly the commercial
value of the material and workmanship; the second, the evaporative power
of boiler, fuel, and cost of working, &c.

    Thinks that the simplest divisor for indicating horse-power, in foot lbs.
per minute, should be 100,000. Sees no objection to retaining the old and
well-known unit of 33,000 font lbs. per minute equal to one-horse power,
and thinks it absolutely essential that both nominal horse-power and indi-
cated horse-power should be defined and recognized by legal enactment,

--and form part of the registered elements of ships the first, or engine

register of nominal horse-power, being essential for the valuation of the
engine, and the second, or indicated power, for the working expenses of the

engine.

   Mr. Greenhow thinks it would be of great value to acquire a true estimate
of the capability for carrying weight of cargo, and advances his reasons for

so thinking :

  --Scientifically. The register ought to be a decided gauge, by which to
--ascertain her capability for carrying weight of cargo.

   Statistically. The returns of tonnage now published afford no criterion
by which to judge of the amount of produce conveyed.

    Considers that the present system of tonnage measurement, as prescribed
by the Merchant Shipping Act of 1854, gives very incorrectly "the internal
roomage of ships."

    Sees no difficulty in a change towards truth, in re-arranging the tonnage
dues, by which no greater amount will be paid by the shipowner.
ON THE MEASUREMENT OP SHIPS FOR TONNAGE.  67

     Thinks there ought to be a limit to the amount of lading.
      States that he has established a rule, by which to establish the position of
 the light and load line, suited to the varying dimensions of different ships.

    He gives the plan of his rule.

     Mr. Lawrie does not think that any restriction should be laid on the
 draught of water in a ship, but that it should be left in the hands of the
 insurers. Thinks a radical change should be made in the mode of measuring
 engine-power.

     Mr. Schoneijder finds that he has been foiled in his search for knowledge
 in England, as regards the size and tonnage of ships, as well as their engine-
 power; the present system of registration giving him no information on this

 important subject.
     Mr. Miller thinks that the present rule (Sterling's) is sufficient for all

 purposes of measurement, and gives correct data for whatever measurements
 may be required yet he considers that, in addition to the same, there should

                                                                             ;

 be supplied a correct scale of displacement; also the proper position of the
 centre of gravity of displacement; centre of effort of sails, and the length of

--the meta-centre, or centre of stability; thereby determining the ship's

 proper trim.

    Does not think it equitable or advisable to make a discriminative distinc-
 tion (to the extent given by the present law) between sailing ships and

 steamers.

    Thinks it desirable that some definite system be adopted that might deter-
 mine the actual working-power of steam-engines for marine purposes.

    Mr. Baxter writes on the loss of ships at sea, and thinks that the capability
 of a ship to convey a cargo safely through the sea is in no way defined, or
 capable of being judged of, by the present system of tonnage.

    Mr. Henry Wright states that, in 1839, before a Committee of Inquiry into
the cause of the Wrecks of Timber Ships, it was found that in 1836-7-8, out of
5427 vessels which cleared from British North America, there was an aggre-
gate loss of 226, or 4*164 per cent, by wreck, of which upwards of 150 were
at sea, the remainder being wrecked on shore. It was remarked that there
were lost as many good as bad ships, showing that the frailty of the vessels
was not the sole cause, but owing to improper over-stowage. The result
was " interference" and the loss was reduced one-half.

    Mr. Wright demonstrates the weakness of the present law io prove the

overloading of a ship, and that insurance offers no safeguard whatever.
    Mr. George Rennie states that he agrees generally in the views of Mr.

Atherton.
    Your Committee, having duly weighed the character of the evidence, and

--the opinions given therein, are of opinion, 1st, That the present method of

measuring and registering the tonnage of shipping, gives a very close
approximation to the internal capacity of a ship ; but that it gives no mea-
sure of the poM'er of a ship to carry weight.

   2ndly. Engine Power (Horse-power), though an item of registration, yet
has no practically definite or legalized signification, as a measure of marine-
engine capability for working power; no unit of power is given, and there
are no registered data by which the working capability of an engine can be
approximately ascertained.

   Your Committee differ in opinion as to the capability of ships for carrying
weight being made an item of registration, but if one denomination of
tonnage only is to be recognized, concur in the opinion that "tonnage"
(though a misnomer as applied to space) should be continued, as under the
present law, to be based on the internal roomage of ships. Consider it

                                                                                                     F2
--68 REPORT 1857.

incompatible with the principles of unrestricted competition to make arbi-
trary discriminations, in the measurements for tonnage, between vessels built
of timber or iron, or fitted with the paddle or the screw (c. 22 and 23), for

the following reasons :

The internal capacity of iron ships (ships built upon the cellular principle,

like the ' Great Eastern ') has not necessarily a greater ratio to the external
bulk, than is the case with wooden ships (ships built on the diagonal plank

principle, like  the  '  Nankin,'  '  Niger,'  and  '  Banshee')                                             but  the very reverse
                                                                                                          ;

may be the case, and the space required for the machinery of a screw-ship, of

given power, is not necessarily either greater or less than the space so

occupied by engines of the same power constructed for a paddle-wheel

vessel.

    Then, again, the law, in its present discriminations between the paddle
and the screw, does not meet the case of the paddle and the screw combined

(as in the ' Great Eastern'), or, indeed, any other combination.
   It therefore appears to your Committee, that discriminations, as regards

the material of which ships are built, or different mechanical contrivances

by which ships are propelled, should be abolished.
   As negards the discriminations between sailing vessels and steamers (sec-

tion 23), whereby, in certain cases, steamers propelled by paddle are allowed
37 per cent, and when by screw, 32 per cent., to be deducted from the gross
tonnage, in consideration of the space occupied by machinerj^ which arbi-

trary deduction gives no consideration to space actually/ appropriated to
engine room, or to the actual power or weight of the machinery, without

which consideration such space may be occupied by cargo, this discrimina-
tion, and the mode of assessing it, appears to your Committed devoid of
principle, and not just even between steamers themselves. For example,
a sailing vessel and a steamer may be of the same gross tonnage (say 1000
tons), but in consequence of the steamer being fitted with auxiliary ma-
chinery, not weighing possibly more than 100 tons, including coals, there is,
by law, in the special cases now referred to, a reduction from its tonnage of
37 per cent., or 370 tons; and again, the reduction of the steamer's tonnage
may be 370 tons, whether the weight of the machinery and coals be actually

100 or 500 tons.
   That in making a deduction for propelling-machinery and fuel, the deduc-

tion for tonnage based on space, as by the present law, should be rated on
actual space occupied; and as respects tonnage based on weight, the reduc-
tion would in effect be rated on the weight of machinery, the same being
included in the light-displacement, which would be deducted from the load-

displacement.

   Your Committee, considering that the question of Government dues or
private dues assessed on shipping is a question between parties in the state

(which, though indirectly bearing on this inquiry, yet is not put to your
Committee as a question for their consideration and report), does not feel
itself called upon in the Report to enter into its merits.

   On the subject of Engine Power, your Committee cannot find that any

statute unit of power has ever been recognized in any legislative enactment
for fixing standard units of quantity (such as the standard yard, gallon,
pound-weight, <S:c.). The registration of horse-power is prescribed by the
Act of 1854, but no legalized definition is given of the term as a measure of
mechanical power, nor has the term "Nominal Horse-power" any definite
signification in trade as a measure of working power ; and consequently
the registration of the engine-power of a steam-ship affords no certain indi-

cation of her engine capabilities.
          ON THE MEASUREMENT OF SHIPS FOR TONNAGE,                                            69

It is found in practice that the actual working-power of marine engines,

with reference to their nominal horse-power, fluctuates upwards of 100 per

cent., and on the general average of the practice of the present day, it

appears that the unit of marine engine horse-power is equivalent to 100,000

lbs. raised one foot high per minute of time, being equal to three times the
unit denominated " Indicated Horse-power" (viz. 33,000 lbs. raised one foot

high per minute).

It appears to your Committee that the legalization by statute of some

standard unit of power is an indispensable requirement of the age ; and the

question is, whether 33,000 lbs. or 100,000 lbs. raised one foot high per

minute, shall be recognized and legalized as the standard unit of power to

which the registration of marine engine-power should have reference.

That the unit designated by 100,000 lbs. raised one foot high per minute,

would nearly approach the working capability per nominal horse-power of the

present   marine  engines,  is  admitted                                         but conceiving that a registration of
                                                                              ;

engine capability would still not give all the information as to the engines

which registration ought to embrace, your Committee recommend that the

registration of marine engines should, in addition to their capability, embrace
the number and diameter of the cylinders, and length of stroke, or other indi-
cation of the size of engine, according to its construction, as well as the number
and size of the boilers, and total area of the fire-grates, whereby the size
and quantity of the machinery on board, irrespective of its capability for

working power, may be at any time compared with the registered description

thereof.

The Committee supposed it important to confine the Report to those points

on which a definite aiid almost unanimous opinion could be given. With
respect to the question relating to the registration of weight-tonnage and

displacement, after maturely considering the evidence, the Committee did not

agree in such a manner as to be able to recommend this portion of the subject

for legislative enactment.

that the members of this Committee will be pleased to meet at the Hall of the
Society of Arts, Adelphi, London, on Thursday, 1st January next, at eight

o'clock P.M., to take into consideration the business assigned to this Com-

operative assistance of the Statistical Section of tlie Britisli Association, in

accordance with the recommendation and resolution of the General Com-

mittee of the British Association to that effect.
    Preparatory to this meeting on Thursday, the 1st January, and in order

that the opinions of each of the members of the Committee, whetiier present
or not, may be known and duly noticed, it is requested that each member
will be pleased to communicate in writing, on or before Monday, 1st De-
cember next, addressed to " The Secretary of the Tonnage Committee, Society
of Arts, Adelphi, London," his opinions on the following points, and on such
other points as may especially occur to respective members in relation to
the matters submitted by the British Association for the consideration of
this Committee:

   1 To particularize the objects of public utility, fiscal, mercantile, scien-
tific, and statistical, sought to be attained, or which may be promoted by a

complete system of measurement, and comprehensive registration of the
tonnage capabilities of ships, and the engine capabilities of steam ships.

    2. Admitting that the present system of tonnage admeasurement, as pre-
scribed by the Merchant Shipping Act of 1854, giving the internal roomage
of ships, affords useful data for registration so far as it goes, what are the
additional details of admeasurement which are required to give the capability
of ships for carrying weight of cargo, and in other respects necessary to render
the official registration of shipping, as periodically published by authority in
the Mercantile Navy List, complete and effective for the objects of public
utility above referred to?

    3. To particularise in what respects the present system of tonnage and
engine-power admeasurement and registration, as prescribed by Part 2 of the
 Merchant Shipping Act of " 1854," is deficient and not effective for the

attainment of the objects of public utility above referred to.
    4. Following the example of limitations commonly prescribed by Govern-

 ment in matters wherein public safety is concerned, such, for example, as
 protection from fire in Building Acts, what are the objections to the official
 assignment of some limit to the load-draught of water, based on ordinary
 conditions of protection from wreck, at which ships may leave port; and
 presuming on the necessity for some limit being assigned which the draught
 of water may not exceed, by what rules may this limit be most correctly
 determined, and by what regulations may it be most efl^ectually enforced
 without involving unnecessary interference with mercantile shipping trans-

 actions ?

     5. In what respects is it commercially equitable, or in other respects
 advisable, to make a discriminative distinction between sailing ships and
 steamers in the measurement of the registered tonnage on which dues may
 be charged on shipping?

     6. In what respects is it commercially equitable, or in other respects advi-
 sable, in the measurement and calculation of registered tonnage, to make a
 discriminative distinction, based on the different materials (whether wood or

 iron, or a combination of both) with which ships may be built, or on the

 diff"erent principles of machinery (whether paddle-wheels, screw-propeller,
 paddle and screw combined, water-jet, or other appliance) with whicii ships

 may be fitted ?
     7. Seeing that no definite measure of power has been specifically fixed by

 law as the statute unit of mechanical power (as has been done to regulate all
 other measures of quantity, as in the cases of the statute yard, the statute
 acre, the statute gallon, the statute pound, &-c.), and seeing, moreover, that
 in the practice of trade, the " nominal horse-power" of a steam-ship does not
ON THE MEASUREMENT OF SHIPS FOR TONNAGE.                                   'jfl

define the measure of power available for the propulsion of the ship (the

capability of engines for the production of working power with reference to
their nominal horse-power being notoriouslj', in some cases, the double of
what it is in others), what steps should be taken to remedy this incongruity

and, presuming on its being determined to adopt some specific measure of
power as the legalized standard unit of power, what definition, measure, or
amount of power, should (in the opinion of the respective members of this

Committee) be adopted as the statute unit of marine engine-power, and by
what name should it be called, viz. whether " horse-power," or "marine horse-
power," or " statute-power," or " units of power," or other denomination ?

   8. The respective members of Committee are requested to state their

opinion whether it be advisable that any particular mode of prosecuting the

details of measurement and working out the calculations thereof (such, for

example, as Sterling's rule) should be prescribed by law for the measurement

of ships, as is done by the Merchant Shipping Act of " 1854;;" or, ought

the system of taking the measurements and working out the calculations to

be left to the discretion of the chief officer of the department on wJiom the

responsibility for the scientific prosecution and accuracy of the calculations

will professionally rest, as in the case of the astronomical calculations for the

Nautical Almanac published by Government, but for which the system of

prosecuting the observations and deducing the calculations is not prescribed
by law, but determined and improved from time to time, as may be, by the

astronomer ; and if it be considered that a prescribed mode of working out

the calculations ought to be fixed and enforced by law, is the rule (Sterling's)
now enforced by the Merchant Shipping Act the best rule now known and

practised for calculating the cubature of ships?

It is not expected that the respective members of this Committee will indi-

vidually express opinions on each and all of the various points above sub-

mitted for their consideration, but it is requested that each member, according

to his special avocation, experience, or acquirements, will address himself to

those points on which he may be regarded as an authority ; and as the com-

plete elucidation of the matters referred to this Committee, with a view to the

public good, is the duty assigned to this Committee, it is requested that each

member will not only express his own opinion, but seek information and confer

with others within his sphere conversant with the matters referred to, though

not members of this Committee ; and for the purpose of aiding in this object

of obtaining information, duplicate copies of the points of investigation above

propounded are enclosed herewith.

    It is further purposed, that as soon as the written opinions or answers of the
respective members of the Committee, to be given in on or before Monday,

the first day of December, shall be received by the Secretaiy, addressed as

Ahave been the taxation of their contents.  keel of coals was a vessel of

given size, carrying a given bulk and weight of coals. The present imperial

tonnage scale is still a mere standard of taxation. It is, however, much more

common to tax tlie ship iiccording to this imperial tonnage, than to levy the

tax on her contents, as originally intended. Taxation by tonnage is, there-

fore, arbitrary ; to distribute taxation, or to exact tonnage dues equitably,
they should be levied on the actual freight or cargo, and not on the mere

vehicle %vhich conveys them. If this were done, tlie present tonnage-laws

might be altogether repealed, or retained for statistical purposes merely. It
would tend much to the promotion of the commerce of this country, if

shipping were thus emancipated frovn the present inequitable restrictions, by

the abandonment of all tonnage dues and tonnage registration for ^^ fiscal

purposes." Dues for lights and harbours, if levied on actual freights and

cargoes, would be much more equitably, and not less efficiently, levied than

at present. I agree with Mr. Napier in thinking this the best solution of all

the difficulties connected with the tonnage question.

If this were done, register tonnage Avould remain as a mere record of the

internal capacity, or of the room inside of ships, an imperial ton being

retained, as now, to indicate a space of 100 cubic feet, or a space of 5 feet,

by 5 feet, by 4 feet. Such measure, used for mere statistical jniiposes, would

be unobjectionable.

For mercantile jfurposes, that is, for chartering or hiring ships, the present

law is most convenient. The bulk of the room which the charterer hires,

and the owner receives payment for, is measured with sufficient precision for

such practical purposes.

   For scientijic piirposes, at least for purposes of naval architecture, it does

not appear to me that anything of the nature of register tonnage or measure-

ment can be of any service. The construction plans, or lines of a ship given

by a shipbuilder, with all the elements of her construction, if combined with

a record of her performance, and an authentic account of lier sailing quali-

ties, would be of great value. Anything short of this, recording some of

her elements, and excluding others, would be more likely to mislead than

inform. Shape is a principal element in the performance of a ship, and the

lines of the ship are required adequately to give that. I do not think that

it would be tolerated in this country by shipbuilders that their lines of con-

struction and scientific elements and calculations should be demanded to be

given up under certain clauses by Act of Parliament; neither, if this diffi-

culty were overcome, could records of qualities be obtained compulsorily, to

--give the compulsory elements of construction the scientific value which

they would only obtain by an equally compulsory record of performance.

Careful experiments, made by individuals or associations, can alone be

expected to afford scientific data of this nature.

4. The example of Government interference in such matters, is so bad an

example, that it should be avoided rather than followed, in imposing restric-

tions on the shipping trade. There is no reason to regard the Government

of our country as either more interested in enabling a ship to perform her

journey safely, or more able to judge of the conditions of such sal'ity, than

her captain and her owner. As every different form of ship, and every

different quality of ship, and various species of cargo and each different

--voyage would admit of, and require, a different degree of loading' this must

be left to the captain and owner, who know their ship and their business,

instead of being consigned to officers who cannot know it.

5. It is a mistake to suppose that, in giving to steam-ships an exemption

from payment of tonnage dues on their engine-room and coal-bunkers, they
ON THE MEASUREMENT OF SHIPS FOR TONNAGE.  73

are obtaining a preference over sailing vessels. On the contrary, it is essen-

tial to fairness that such exemption should be given. Sailing ships already
possess such exemption in the existing tonnage-law. The divisor 100, in

the tonnage-law, gives that exemption. The real ton of freight is 4-0 cubic
feet in most things, and, in some, 50 feet. The difference between the mer-

cantile ton of 40 feet, and the imperial register ton of 100 feet, is designed
to give the shipowner ample exemption for that portion of the internal room

of a ship which is occupied by captain's cabins, sailors' berths, sails, cables,

cordage, chains, anchors, sea-stores, provisions, and all the requisites of

mooring and working the ship. This exemption has been recognized in all

--the tonnage-laws of this country. It has been merely extended to the steam-

ship on the same footing the propelling power, and all provisions for it,
being included in a similar exemption. The error of the present law con-

sists in making that exemption on an arbitrary tonnage, instead of the actual

--tonnage of engine room an error which no time should be lost in re-

medying.

   6. I do not see, and cannot imagine, why any exemption should be made
other than that of the actual room occupied by engines, boilers, and fuel.

   7. The only true measure of power is the work actually performed by a
marine engine; this work will vary with the talent of the maker, with the

care and intelligence of the keeper of the engine, with the age and condition

of the boiler, and with the qualities and loading of the ship. In the absolute

sense of true power, two engines, in whicli all the main dimensions are alike,

and both perfectly new, will give out a totally different practical result. This
is why the engine of one maker is well worth £60 per horse-power, and of
another not worth £30. Yet, under varying circumstances, a given engine
will perform double at one time from another.

    Owing, therefore, to the great variety in kinds and qualities of engines, it
is neither politic nor expedient to attempt to define power in a form more
absolute than the nature of the subject practically admits. The scale com-
monly used among engineers for buying and selling engines is just as good as
any other, so long as the talent of the builder and the knowledge of the uses
is a main element of power of a marine engine. It is a question of name
and character more than of dimensions and measure. Legislation cannot
safely try to trammel such elements.

    8. Practically, Sterling's rule, or Attwood's rule, or Chapman's rule, or
any ordinary intelligent rule, will tell very accurately the cubic contents of
the inside of a ship. I do not see any grave fault in the present rule, though
 I will not assert that some more minutely precise rule for purposes of abstract
 science might not be given.

  --Conclusion. The result of considerable thought and pains given to this

examination is that, in my opinion, we need not ask any alteration of the law

regulating Imperial Register Tonnage, except the rectification of the allow-
ance for engine-i-oom, which remains fictitious and arbitrary. Neither should
I recommend any further interference of Government officers with the ret^is-
tration or working of ships or steam-vessels. I look for the advancement of
naval architecture rather to the association of naval constructors and men of
 science with each other, and the mutual communication of their notions and
 knowledge, than to empirical efforts of legislation ; and I hope for progress
 in navigation, rather from the general advancement of education and know-
 ledge, among all who are concerned in shipping, than from any trammels
 which, in the disguise of assistance and regulation. Government might be
 induced to impose on the captains and owners of ships.

--74 REPORT 1857.

--No. 3. Rev. Dr. Woolley {Member of the Commi(tee').

To the Hon. Secretary of the Tonnage Committee.

                                                                                      Portsmouth Dockyard, Feb. 27, 1857.

  --Sir, I regret that so few members of the Committee have put us in

possession of their opinions on the subjects on which we have to report;

especially that no actual builder of sliips has given us the benefit of his

experience.

   As regards the report, I am of opinion that we should keep in view two

--objects ! 1. The particularising of the useful objects which an interchange

between shipbuilders of information witii regard to ships actually built by

them, might be expected to produce. 2. Those objects which an enforced

registration ought to attain.

   1. On a careful consideration of the whole subject, I have embraced the

decided opinion that it is hopeless to look for such information as would be

useful in a scientific point of view from legislative enactment. There are so

many points beside light and load displacement, indicated horse-power. Sec,

which must be known in order to form a sufficient scientific estimate of the

value of a ship, tliat I fear an enforced registration of certain particulars

would be found to be a delusion. Our scientific objects can best be attained

by the voluntary association of persons interested in shipbuilding and the

science of naval architecture. If the British Association would lend the

sanction of its authority to tlie recommendation of the institution of a Naval

Architectural Society, it would, I think, be conferring a greater boon on

science than by any other means.
   Legislative interference is very much to be deprecated, except to serve an

object in every way commensurate with the evils which all restrictions impose

Weupon trade.  cannot too jealously guard against unnecessary restraints,

and should be very chary of calling lor Government assistance. The well-

known maxim of Horace applies M'ith great force to legislative interference

with matters of this kind

               Ncc Deus intersit nisi clignus vindice nodus

               Inciderit.

   I cannot say that it appears to me that any adequate object has been pro-

posed in the various answers to the eight queries of which I have received

an abstract. On one point all seem agreed, viz. that absolute fairness in the

incidence of tolls can only be secured by charging in every case on the actual
freight. Short of this, and if it be not feasible to make the actual freight

the basis of levying the dues, then I am of opinion that it is impossible to
devise a general rule fairer than that which is now in force.

   I cannot see that the public are much interested in this question. The
ownership of ships is in a sufficient number of hands to protect the public

from anything like a monopoly, and to render the application of the princi-
ples of supply and demand secure. The competition existing among ship-
owners is a sufficient security that the carriage of goods will be fixed at the

lowest remunerative price. No doubt the more science is brougiit to bear

on shipbuilding the greater will be the economy, both as regards the first
cost and the management of vessels, and owners will consequently be able
to charge a lower price for the carriage of goods and passengers. But I do
not think that the application of science is to be sought by legislative

enactment.

  --2. An enforced registration would have for its object First, to secure

fairness in levying Government dues (in case dues should continufe to be
levied on tonnage) ; and secondly, to give a fair idea of the amount of ton-
ON THE MEASUREMENT OF SHIPS FOR TONNAGE.  75

nage or roomage, or whatever it may be called, employed for mercantile
purposes. The space available at the usual rate of 40 cubic feet to a ton, is
quite sufficient for the purpose ; and as the internal roomage divided by 100
does on the average bear a definite ratio to this space, I am inclined to think

that the present registration is sufficient for merely statistical objects.

   Among the reasons which have weighed most with me, in arriving at the

above conclusions, are the following :
   In all the rules which have been established by Act of Parliament for the

measurement of tonnage, the legislature has had one object in view, viz. to
provide for the fair incidence of tolls.

   If measurement by weight were taken as the basis of registration, external
measurement, as proposed by the Tonnage Committee of 184^9, viz. up to
the deck, would not be more correct than the present legalized internal
measurement ; and it would have the disadvantage of offering an induce-

--ment to build ships of insufficient strength as the greater the ratio of the

internal to the external capacity for the greater number of cargoes, the more
advantageous would the arrangement be to the owner. It is generally
acknowledged that a comparatively large interior space or roomage, is of prin-
cipal importance in the eyes of shipowners; and that it would not be a recom-

mendation generally, that, with a small internal capacity, a vessel possessed

large capacity for carrying weight. If, therefore, the registration were based
on external measurement, it would become the interest of the owner to

--reduce the scantling of the vessel to the lowest possible dimensions even

verging upon danger.
   The ' Great Eastern,' now building at Millwall, will have a large external

displacement compared with its internal roomage, owing to its being built on
the cellular principle. I cannot think this an advantage, viewed merely in a
commercial or economical point of view, as the prime cost is greater, and the
vessel when built is not as available for the ordinary run of merchandise as
others which have a proportionably larger internal roomage.

   The strength of a vessel is a very important element in its construction
and it appears to me that the registration of tonnage for dues on the external
instead of the internal measurement up to the deck would operate greatly to

the detriment of this element.

   The carriage of passengers cannot be considered as among the least
lucrative of the uses to which a ship may be put. The room required for

each passenger is out of all proportion greater than the weight of himself
and luggage. Passenger ships, with a comparatively small displacement,
require large internal roomage ; and as all covered spaces are included in the
present internal measurement, the incidence of dues is far more just on the
present law than it would be on a law which established a system of mere
external measurement.

    It has been urged that the prevalence of shipwrecks and consequent loss
of life must be laid to the door of the present defective state of shipping
registration. I do not, however, find that the result of the inquiries of per-

sons most competent to judge corroborates this view. Among the causes

which the seamen themselves (no incompetent judges) urge, such as the
enormous competition of late years, insufficiency and incompetency of crews
and officers, I do not find the overloading of ships. I cannot but infer from
this significant silence that such a cause is not in operation, at least to any

 considerable extent.

    To appreciate the qualities of a vessel in a scientific point of view, a know-
ledge of the light and load displacements, as well as of the area of midship
section, and of the form of the ship, especially towards the bows and stern,
--76 REPORT 1857.

is absolutely indispensable. The qualities of the vessel, as shown at sea, are
also necessary elements to forming tins estimate. Of these none but the
load and light displacements have been proposed to become the subjects of
registration ; and these alune would by no means supply that information

which must form tlic basis of all scientific estimate.
    External measurements up to the deck, as proposed by the Commission of

J 849, would afford no data for obtaining a knowledge of the light and load
displacement. The first requisite for this purpose is to fix a definite load
water-line. The impracticability of defining such limit, openly avowed by
one Koyal Commission, has been felt and acted on by all. There is no rule

--of science which can establish it it is always to a certain extent a matter of

judgment, and it varies not only with every different condition of lading and
trim, but also with the season of the year. It may be, or it may not be, that
a rule for the defining of free-board, in other words, the distance between the
load water-line and the deck, expressed in definite parts of the principal

dimensions, may answer tolerably well for the actual practice, with regard

to a considerable proportion of our present mercantile navy; but such a
rule can be nothing but the merest empiricism, would certainly not satisfy a
majority of persons at present interested in shipping, and might be found
absolutely inapplicable to vessels built on some improved principle, which
 not only maj', but probably will, be introduced into naval architecture within

a few years. The fixing of the load water-line on other than strictly scien-
tific principles (and no such exist), would in all probability check improve-
ment and progress ; and would certainly be very unworthy of the recom-
 mendation of a professedly scientific body like the British Association.

     I think also that an official assignment of a limit to the load-draught of
 water would be attended with vexatious interference on the part of local
 officials most inimical to trade ; and I think, with Mr. Laurie, that this is a

 matter which may be safely left to be settled between the insurers and the
 insured. It is difficult to conceive any mode of determining legally this

 limit, which cannot be assigned on any scientific principle that would not
 operate as a check to the progress of science in the art of shipbuilding, which

 must be free if it is to flourish with vigour.

    On the fifth question I am now prepared to state my opinion, that the

 present law makes too great a difference between steamers and sailing ships.
 For the very same reason that a fractional part only of the contents of a
 sailing ship is taken as the registered tonnage, which in the first instance was
 undoubtedly to allow ample room for the crew and all the necessary stores
 and equipment of the vessel, I think that the excepting from the tonnage the
 space actually occupied by the engines, boilers and coals, is equitably fair.
 The measurement, however, should be limited to the space actually occupied
 by the engines, &c. It would be unfair to include the space in that on
 which dues are paid. Not only are the first cost and the expenses of work-
 ing a steam-ship much greater than those of a sailing vessel of the same
  capability of carrying cargo, but, in consequence of the motive power, the
 dues of the one are paid three or four times for each payment by the other.

     With regard to the sixth question. In the absence of any information
 from practical shipbuilders, I can see no valid reason for making any distinc-
 tion whatever, based on the different materials of which ships may be built.

 A wooden ship and an iron ship built on the same lines, and calculated for

 the same deep draught, would differ somewhat in capability of carrying
  cargo, the difference being in favour of the iron ship, which would also pay

 a somewhat higher rate of dues, having a larger internal capacity. On the

  whole I believe by registration of internal capacity the assessment is pretty
ON THE MEASUREMENT OP SHIPS FOR TONNAGE  77

fairly apportioned between vessels, whatever be the material of whicli they
are composed. Nor can I see more reason for making a discriminative
distinction between vessels, based on the different principles of machinery

with which they may be fitted.
   With regard to the seventh point. Although the term horse-power, and

the measure of useful effect which it represents, have not been specifically
fixed by law, I apprehend that, in case of a question arising between builder
and purchaser, with regard to the term indicated horse-power, the law-courts
would have no difficulty in arriving at a definite meaning of this term.

   Not only in England, where it originated, but in America, and generally
throughout the civilized world, the measure of useful effect, to which the
name horse-power is given, viz. 33,000 lbs. raised one foot high per minute,
has long been accepted. The confusion which would be introduced by the
adoption of any other measure would be much more than equivalent to any
advantage which would attend its adoption, this advantage being, at the
most, the approximate assimilation of the indicated horse-, as at present deve-
loped by engines on the average, to the nominal horse-power. The great
name of Watt has given a value and currency to the present measure, which
have placed it beyond all rivalry ; nor could any new measure hope to come

into competition with it.

   The object of the proposal to fix the statute power by Act of Parliament,
seems to be, to require that the registered power should be a real measure
of the power exerted. It appears to me that nothing could be more difficult
than to subject this to an eft'ective measurement, depending, as it does, upon
so many different qualities. If it be proposed to register the horse-power as
indicated, on trials of ships under certain specified circumstances, nothing
could well be more delusive, as it would be by no means difficult, according
as it suited the interest of the owner or maker, to make this power, so deve-
loped, vary within almost any assignable limits, on one side or other, of the
power which Avould be usually exerted. Nothing can be imagined more
inquisitorial than to require private individuals to make such trials of their

-- --engines and all merely to serve scientific purposes which trials, after all,

could not be in the least depended on.
    The present nominal horse-power is useful as giving the dimensions, &c.

 of the engine, which must form the basis on which contracts are to be made.

 It is indifferent whether this be retained in its present form, or the several
items be given under the name of " Engine Register." I agree with Mr.
 Napier in thinking an enforced registration of engine-power needless. I
 cannot see what the public have to do with it. It is the business of the
 customer to enter into such a contract with the engine-maker, as to secure
 his obtaining the article he wants. The terms of a contract are of course
 open to arrangement between the parties interested ; and if in addition to

 the dimensions, &c. of the engine, the contract includes the stipulation that
 on a trial trip, under certain specified conditions, the engine shall work up to
 some defined limit of indicated horse-power, I apprehend that, in case of
 litigation, a jury would experience no difficulty arising from indefiniteness
 in the term Indicated Horse-power. There never has been more than one
 measure of this important element, and there seems no necessity of calling

 in the aid of Parliament to fix it. I apprehend that no practical difficulty
 has been felt on this score.

  --With regard to the eighth query: 1st, I see no comparison whatever

 between the calculations for the ' Nautical Almanac' and the calculations for
 ships. Astronomical science embraces a wide field ; and many of the acutest
 minds in Europe are employed on it. In the vast variety of methods in use
--78 REPORT 1857.

in practical astronomy, it is to be expected that improvements sliould be

continually made ; and it is of course advisable that the officers charged with

the responsibility of" bringing out the 'Nautical Almanac' should be able to

avail themselves of improved methods. Moreover, the Astronomer Royal,

who is always one of the most eminent men of science in this country, and

it may also be said in Europe, is the superintendent-in-chief of the ' Nautical

Almanac' The reputation and acknowledged ability of the scientific officers

concerned in this case are a sufficient guarantee of the accuracy of the

methods they employ.

The rule or rules employed for the calculation of tonnage or displacement

are of a very different nature. As a matter of fact, no real improvement

has been made in the method, in a scientific point of view, since the days of

Newton, the rule called Simpson's or Sterling's having in reality been invented

by Newton. The great merits of this rule are, that it is as accuiate as any

rule for the measurement of a figure not strictly geometric can be, and that

it is simple and easy of application. As applied to obtain internal roomage,

Stirling's rule requires only measurements to be taken at certain intervals,

and these measurements are very easily made. The whole process, after the

measurements are made, is simply arithmetical. The accuracy of the mea*

surements can be tested by laying them down to a fixed scale on paper, and

passing a curve through them ; but this curve is not required for the purpose

of making the calculations.

Mr. Peake's method is founded on the very same principle; but, in the

mypoints wherein it differs, it is, in  opinion, no improvement. First areas

of sections are calculated as usual ; then two sets of calculations are after-

wards required to complete the operation. The areas of sections are repre-

sented on paper by lines set off to a certain scale, and an elaborate system of

exhausting the area so formed is employed. This is evidently a far more

complex and difficult process than to make simple calculations from ordi-

nates at once. In taking, also, the greatest distances from various base-

lines of points in the curved portion, Mr. Peake assumes that he obtains the

areas more correctly than Sterling's rule gives them. This is a mere assump-

tion, founded on no known property of the parabola, which is the curve

supposed to pass through any three points.

  We know that a parabola may be made to fulfil five conditions; if it pass

--through three points it fulfils three of these and its having its axis parallel

Weto a fixed line, is equivalent to the fulfilment of the other two.  know

also, that a parabola so drawn, subject to the ordinary conditions under which

this (Sterling's method) is applied, is palpably, to the eye, coincident with

the section of the ship. It is, at all events, impossible to draw a regular curve

more nearly coincident with it.

It would be very dangerous, as it would be unnecessary, to leave subordi-

nate agents to exercise their own discretion in the use of methods for calcu-

lating tonnage, when a rule so simple and correct as Sterling's is at their

command. 1 conceive, therefore, that no alteration is required, or advisable,

in the rule now in force under the Merchant Shipping Act of 1854.

                I have the honour to be. Sir, your obedient Servant,

Reply to Tonnage Committee's Circular of 6th November, 1856, by

                                        James R. Napier.

--1. The objects of registering shipping I believe are, 1st. For the purpose
ON THE MEASUREMENT OF SHIPS FOR TONNAGE.                           ^9

of levying such dues as to reimburse the proprietors of docks, harbours,

rivers, lighthouses, &c. &c., for the expenses they may have been at in pro-

viding such accommodation. 2nd. For the purpose of simplifying the process

of transferring the property from one owner to another. 3rd. The shipbuilder

and shipowner might wish to know the efficiency of a vessel, but I cannot

conceive that any public registration is necessary for this purpose, as the

shipbuilder or engineer has all the elements in his possession for finding,

what may be called, the scientific efficiency, and the shipowner's cash account
will soon show him the mercantile efficiencj-, by the profits he is making

upon his capital ; and I do not see that the public have anything to do with

the question.

3. The present system of tonnage admeasurement is more minute than is

necessary, and of little or no use to the shipbuilder, as his designs, calcula-

tions, «&c. are based almost exclusively upon the weight of ship and cargo,

and seldom upon her internal roomage.

   4. I am inclined now to take Mr. Russell's view of this subject, and not

to limit the load-draft of water.

5. I have not sufficiently considered this question.

6. I cannot see any reason for making a distinction between vessels built

of wood, iron, or of any other material, in their measurement. In the re-

gistration, the material may be named ; it would be useful to do so.
   7. Nominal horse-power is a useless term. It has no relation whatever to

the power the machine may be exerting, and is a very round-about and even

indefinite way of expressing the size of a steam-engine, or rather of its

cylinders. According to the Government ideas of the subject, even where

every length of stroke (in paddle-wheel engines) has a different velocity for

the piston to travel, the size of cylinders for a given power is quite indefi-

nite. It is useless for the purposes of buying and selling, for the cost of

construction does not vary as the nominal horse-power. Instead of nominal

horse-power, I would substitute simply the capacity of cylinders, or area of

cylinders, X length of stroke. This is positive information, and would be

useful in buying and selling, and might be inserted in the register of the

Avessel.  legal standard of power would remove some confusion which at

present exists, and as the elements of such a standard are already recognized,

viz. the lb., the foot, and the minute or second, there can be little difficulty

in combining them, and calling the unit " foot pounds," or " ft. lbs.," per

Aminute or per second.  horse-power is already known to be 33,000 foot

lbs. per minute, and I see no good reason for changing this term.

8. Sterling's rule is very good, but all vessels, large and small, ought to

be divided into the same number of ordinates, and five ordinates would give

a near enough approximation to the capacity of the ship for all the ordinary

purposes of trade.

     --No. 5. Mr. Charles Athkrton {Member of the Committee).

                             General Summary of his Report.

   The foregoing matters touching the Merchant Shipping Act of 1854, have
been thus generally gone into for the purpose of opening up those points of
inquiry which bear especially on the limited duties assigned to this Com-
mittee by the British Association, namely, " To inquire into the present
methods, and to frame more perfect rules for the measurement and regis-
tration of ships and of marine engine-power, in order that a correct and
uniform principle of estimating the actual carrying capabilities and working-
power of steam-ships may be adopted in their future registration," and the
80 REPORT-- 1857.

conclusion at which I arrive on the points thus referred to this Committee

--are, that the Merchant Shipping Act of 1854' is an admirably conceived

base of legislation, intended to concentrate all the objects for which legisla-
tion, in its protection of public interests, can be called upon to take cogni-
zance of shipping affairs; that, so far as the inquiries assigned to tiiis Com-
mittee are concerned, and which relate exclusively to Part 2 of the Act,
there appears to be no absolute necessity for the cancelling any part of the
existing clauses ; but it is necessary that the provisions of the Act be
extended to meet the following requirements, which are indispensable to the
protection and promotion of public interests.

   1. The Act of 1854 is defective, in so far that the prcscribeil registration,
though called tonnage, takes no direct cognizance whatever of the tons
weight of cargo that will either sink the ship, or that will immerse a ship
down to any definite gauge-mark. The consequence is, that a ship chart-
ered for the conveyance of merchandise may be filled with some descrip-
tions of goods without being half-loaded, or sunk with other descriptions of
goods without being half-filled. To remedy this deficiency, it is necessary

not only that the registration shall give the capacity of a ship for holding
cargo, as is done by the present law, but also the capability for carrying

weight of cargo as determined by the weight that will sink the ship down to
a given gauge-mark, to be fixed upon the stem and stern or amidships of

every ship.

   2. The Act of 1854; is defective, in so far that it prescribes no regulations
whereby the draught of water at which ships actually put to sea may be
officially inspected and recorded, with reference to a statute gauge-mark, as
above described, to be fixed upon every ship, such record to be received as

evidence in the case of questions subsequently arising as to the condition in

which ships put to sea; for the want of which record many of the provisions
of the Act, evidently intended for the protection of life, become futile for
want of proof as to the freeboard with which ships put to sea.

    3. It is submitted that the official imposition of a gauge-mark to be fixed
on the stem and stern of ships, or amidships, for the purposes above referred
to, would, of itself, without any interference whatever on the part of Govern-
ment officers in the loading of ships, tend greatly to the prevention of over-
loading, whereby ships are rendered unmanageable and life endangered.
The provisions of the Act for the protection of life would then become
operative instead of being a dead letter as respects the overloading of ships.

    4. The Act of 1854 is deficient, in so far that it does not prescribe the
measure of the unit by which the registered engine power of steam-ships is to
be determined, nor has any other Act of Parliament prescribed the unit of
power by which engine-power may be legally ascertained and designated
nor has engineering practice adopted any specific unit as the measure by
which marine engine-power is bought and sold. It is admitted that the
working-power of marine engines, as supplied to Government bj- the most

eminent engineers under contract at the nearly uniform price of £50 per

 nominal horse-power, fluctuates upwards of 100 per cent, with reference to
their nominal power, which regulates the cost. Under these circumstances,
 the registration of engine power, without reference to any legalised statute
 unit, is an imposition on public credulity.

     .5. It is submitted that the legalisation of a statute unit of power, and the
 legislative obligation that the registered power or engine capabilities of
 steam-ships shall be ascertained and registered with reference to the said
 statute unit, will be no more of government interference with mercantile and

 engineering aflPairs, than is the imposition of the statute lineal foot, the statute
       ON THE MEASUREMENT OP SHIPS FOR TONNAGE.                            81

Agallon, or the statute ton weight.  legalised statute unit of power is a

positive requirement of the age. It is not proposed that there shall be any
obligation as to engines being woi'ked up to the full power that thej' are

capable of developing, any more than that ships shall not put to sea without

being fully loaded.

   6. It is further submitted that the deficiencies of the Act of" ISS^," in

respect of the defective registration above referred to, vitiate the public

statistics of the country so far as based on the registration of shipping; for,

as shown in the foregoing pages, the ratio between the registered tonnage

of a ship, and its capability for safely carrying weight of cargo, depends in

great measure on the dimensions or proportions of length, breadth and depth
of the ship ; so much so, that (as shown) a ship of 2000 tons register may be
so proportioned as to have no displacement available for cargo without

encroaching on the freeboard necessary to the safety of the ship, whilst an-

other ship may be so proportioned externally and constructed internally as

to carry safely the double of her registered tonnage, especially in the case

of auxiliary powered steam-ships, which now threaten to supersede sailing

ships altogether. Hence the mere registered tonnage of ships is not of itself

a statistical criterion of the extent of trade, excepting in so far as respects

the carrying power of similarly proportioned and similarly built vessels.

   7. Registration under the Act of " 1854?" does not meet the requirements
of commercial operations, as shown by shipping advertisements, which fre-

quently ignore the legalised registration under the Act of "ISM'," and refer to

other designations of tonnage, such as gross tonnage, tons burden, tonnage
O.M., tons (without designation), all which terms are made use of irrespec-

tive of the register ton, and not one of all these five terms for tonnage

expresses or has any constant ratio whatever to the one thing needful, namely,

the tons weight of cargo that a ship will carry with reference to any statute

gauge mark. Then, again, we see engines advertised as 100 H.P. nominal,

but 450 H.P. effective, and neither nominal H.P. nor effective H.P. have

any statute signification or definite ratio to each other.
   8. The Act of "1854" in respect of its r(>gistration deficiencies, is obstruc-

tive of the application of science to maritime engineering and architecture,

as respects all investigations into the comparative dynamic performances of

steam-ships as a means for practically determining the best type of form for
the respective purposes or services for which ships may be required. The

extent to which this exclusion of science for so important a part of naval

engineering and architecture as that of developing the dynamic economy of
different types of ships, is adverse to public interests, may be judged of from

the fact, that on estimating the comparative dynamic capabilities of ships of

given size, and required to steam at a given speed, but of different types of

form, by any recognised law of scientific comparison, a vast difference of

dynamic merit is found to be prevalent. The great majority of ships are

found to be of a low order of dynamic merit, below what has been found to
be practically realisable ; so much so, that the average of the generality of

shipping requires probably 25 per cent, more power to attain a given speed

than is required (cceteris paribus) by vessels of the superior type, whicli is

occasionally produced ; and when it is considered that the trade and navi-
gation returns for " 1856" show that the foreign import and export trade of

Great Britain, as indicated by the registered tonnage of shipping, amounts to

18 millions of tons per annum, whilst the home trade amounts to 26 millions,

being a total of 44 millions of tons per annum, sea-borne trade (that is, if

the weight-carrying capability of ships be on the average equal to the

register tonnage), and as the cost of all merchandise to the consumer,
       '

such as corn and cotton, depends considerably on the cost of transport, it
must be admitted that the registration of tonnage and engine power, though

required only for the exclusive purpose of rendering science available for

improving the dynamic performances of steam-ships, is, of itself, a considera-

tion which demands the interference of the legislature as the guardian of

public interests in all public affairs.

    In conclusion, therefore, it is submitted that the defective condition of our
shipping registration under the Act of " 1854," is such as demands the con-

sideration of parliament with a view to the extension of the Act to meet the

following I'equirements :

1 That a statute gauge-mark shall be affixed on each side, amidships of

every ship, for indicating the statute freeboard, the exact position of said

mark to be determined by a rule based on the length, breadth and depth of

the ship taken in such proportions as the legislature shall determine, and

corresponding marks shall be fixed on the stem and stern at such position in

line with the midship mark as the approved water-line trim of the vessel

shall indicate, and the dimensions of length, breadth and depth by which
the position of the midship mark is determined shall be registered.

2. That in addition to the present registi-ation of tonnage, based on inter-

nal measurement, the registration shall include the displacement of the vessel

when light ready to receive cargo equipped in all respects ready for sea, but

not including coals and other consumable stores, also the displacement when

immersed down to the statute gauge-marks before referred to, and the total

displacement measuring up to the deck ; these displacements taken iu cubic

feet, to be rated at 35i cubic feet to the ton weight, and the difference
between the light displacement, and the statute gauge-mark displacement,

to constitute the registered weight-tonnage of the ship.

   3. That the draught at which ships actually put to sea shall be inspected
and recorded with reference to the statute gauge-mark on the stem and

stern of the ship.
   4-. That a standard measure of power be determined and legalised as the

statute unit, to which the registration of the engine power of steam-ships shall

have reference ; the registered power shall be that which engines and boilers

shall, for the time being, be capable of continuously exerting, the same being

ascertained by means of the indicator, as usual in the trial of steamers, and

calculated by the statute unit.

                                         Charles Atherton.

Woolwich Dockyard, 3rd March, 1857.

    --No. 6. Mr. Andrew Henderson (Member of the Committee).

                             General Summary of his Report.

    The British Association having appointed a Committee " to inquire into
the defects of the present methods, and to frame more perfect rules for the
measurement and registration of ships and marine engine power, in order
that a correct and uniform principle may be adopted in their future regis-
tration," the following review of the opinions and information is submitted,
premising that the members of the Committee, being unanimous in opinion
that the removal of all fiscal dues levied on tonnage would be the best solu-
tion of all the difficulties connected with the tonnage question. Although
not included in the above, it was considered so important, that the writer was
deputed by the Committee to seek information on the subject.

   The result of this inquiry shows that, although the original object of
register tonnage may have been the taxation of the cargoes of ships, it baf
           ON THE MEASUREMENT OF SHIPS VOR TONNAGE.  83

long since ceased to be used as a basis of taxation, inasmuch as all fiscal

dues or duties are levied by the Custom-house on the cargoes imported and

exported.

The only dues or rates levied on tonnage are for harbour and dock accom-

modation and light dues, for maintenance of lights on the coast ; the former

being mostly paid to local trusts or dock companies, while the light dues,

although levied by the Custom-house, are paid to the Trinity-house for the

maintenance of the lights ; so that these dues cannot, in point of fact, be any

longer considered as fiscal or government.

   Many of the light-houses, previous to 1835, were private property, till
purchased by the Trinity-house Corporation, who thereby incurred a debt

of £1,200,000. The shipowners have paid oif both principal and interest.

The light dues now charged on tonnage amounts to £313,208, and the cost

of maintenance amounts to £214,700, the surplus revenue from light dues,

£98,508, being received by the Board of Trade for the Mercantile Marine

Fund-

The coasts of France and America are lighted by their respective govern-

ments without charge on shipping. Both equity and policy dictate the

expediency of relieving the shipowners of this country from all tonnage dues

for lights, and transferring the charge to the cargoes and passengers carried

by ships, or to the Consolidated Fund.

  A bill in parliament proposes to abolish all passing tolls and town dues

levied on shipping, the latter at Liverpool amounting to £125,000 a-year,

being raised by a small rate levied on all cargoes imported or exported on

Athe Mersey.  similar rate on cargo levied at all other ports would provide

the£250,000 annually required for maintaining the lights, buoys and beacons,

and for the conservancy of the ports and rivers on our coasts. The substi-

tution of light dues levied on cargo and passengers for the present tonnage

dues levied on shipping, would entail no additional labour on the Custom-

house officers, as they must necessarily keep a record of all goods imported

and exported at each port. This is a more legitimate occupation than the
measurement of ships, which is stated to be " an extraneous duty thrown

upon their oflicers," in a report from the Commissioners of Customs recently

published.

Both economy and efficiency would be efiected by the transfer of the duty

of measuring ships from the Custom-house officers and department, to the
shipwright and engine surveyors, now employed by the Board of Trade for

all ships carrying passengers, whose certificate of survey would furnish the

Custom-house with the dimensions, register, and gross tonnage, and other

particulars required for the various forms of register and transfer of vessels

these also forming the record for compiling the statistics of the shipping of

the country, which comprises the only remaining usefulness of tonnage

registration for statistical purposes at the Custom-house, tliere being no

longer any fiscal dues or Government duties levied on the tonnage of shipping,

notwithstanding which, up to the present time, the Board of Trade and Go-

vernment have only considered the measurement of tonnage and registration

in a purely fiscal point of view.

   The reasons for these conclusions will be found in the facts of the work-

ing of the present system, detailed in the foregoing paper, in which it was

found necessary to refer to the proceedings of former committees, and the

different principles of measurement in use.

In 1835 an Act was passed adopting the principle of internal measurement

for register tonnage.

In 1849 the Bubject was again investigated by a committee, consisting of

                                                                      g2
--84 REPORT 1857.

Lord J. Hay and a body of shipowner.*, vvlio reported that " the equi-

table basis on wiiich charges for dock, light, harbour, and other dues,

Ais that of the entire cubic contents of a vessel measured externally."  bill,

based on this recommendation, was brought in, computing the tonnage by

means of diagrams of section, and curves of areas, with a scale of dis-

placement.

   This bill was opposed by the owners of timber ships and the builders of
iron vessels, and from this and political causes was deferred.

   At that time I proposed that the principle of the bill of 1850, and of the
plan recommended by Mr. Moorsom for internal measurement, should be
embodied in one bill, and the mean of the two measurements be taken as
the basis for register tonnage; and before the bill was actually passed, I
submitted that this could still be accomplished by combining the Rule No. 1
of the bill of 1850 as well as Rule No. 2, which already forms part of the
bill, by an alteration of the clauses 20, 21, 22, of the present act.

     Register tonnage is necessary for statistical purposes, but should approxi-

mate the old builder's tonnage, in Avhich the statistics of shipping have,
from the earliest times, been kept, and which more nearly assimilates that
of other nations. There are, however, objects to be attained by a more
comprehensive system of tonnage registration, viz. the saCety and efficiency

of the ships, their mercantile capabilities, and to supply scientific data

for facilitating a comparison of the various types of ships, including a record

of their burthen in weight or displacement, capacity, strength of material and
steam-power. The practicability of obtaining this record is exemplified by
the annexed table of the dimensions and proportions of ships and engines
and comparative analysis of their capacity, resistance, and the result of test-
trials and performance at sea ; the particulars recorded of many affording
data for estimating the comparative dynamic merits of ships by the co-effi-
cient of their displacement or index number. The additional measurement
and data required are shown in the table. (Appendix A.)

   With this view it is proposed to substitute for the forms now sent to the

Custom-house, the record, on the present builder's " certificate, of all parti-
culars of dimensions, old tonnage and measurement by new rule, mentioned

in the accompanying form, giving the builder's construction, load, draft,
displacement, and area of midship section, as well as the launching draught,

and estimated weight of hull and fittings as the light water-line, from which
a scale of displacement and area of midship section may be formed at any
draught of water." (Vide Appendix B.)

    These particulars relating to the external bulk and internal space, with
the draught, displacement, and area, would not oidy give the internal capa-
city, but also the capability for carrying weight of cargo, as well as the data
forming a scale for displacement and area of midship section at any draught
of water, whence may be deduced the relative efficiency of different vessels.

    I consider the present plan of taking and recording the internal measure-
ment, and the mode of computation to be practically inefficient for obtaining
a correct mensuration of vessels, and that the formula and mode of calcu-
lating are extremely liable to error, without the means of testing their cor-
rectness, as was suggested by the Tonnage Committee of 1849.

    Tiie Act of 1851', though nominally adopting the same scientific rule, in

effect abandoned the most important part, viz. tlie use of the diagram and

curves of areas.

By using paper ruled to a scale in the formation of the diagram, the com-

putation is rendered both easy and correct, and a record of these measure-

ments, &c. in the certificate of the surveyor would furnish the owuer or

government with the means of ascertaining the weight of cargo carried or

the capacity for light goods.
    All measurements, however made, ought to be attested by the builder or

owner, <S:c. and recorded on the certificate.
   The correctness of Sterling's rule is entirely based on the assumption

that the sections should be measured at exactly equal distances, but experi-
ence ])rovcs that in practice it is almost impossible to obtain these measure-

ments at the exact intervals required.
    It is, however, of comparatively little importance by what method a vessel

is measured, provided means are at the same time used to check the calcu-
lations, and the most simple and practical mode of accomplishing this is by
the method so long used by Mr. James Peake, viz. by a system of vertical
sections and curves of areas, measured by a series of triangles. Annexed is
a comparison of four modes of measurement. (Appendix C.)

    The black lines on the right side show the plan as recommended by the
Tonnage Commission of 1849, and the measurement proposed in Bill of

1850.

    The triangular lines on the extreme right represent Mr. Peake's method

for displacement to load-line.

    The dotted lines on the left represent Mr. Moorsom's mode, adopted in
 the present act, as shown in formula No. 1, p. 30, in substitution of that
 recommended by the Tonnage Commission, of which he was secretary.

    The diagonal lines on the left represent M. Norman's on the French

 plan, useful in correcting other measurements, or if built true to design.
     For statistical purposes, owing to the great decrease, as above shown, of

 from 8 to 10 per cent, in the Register Tonnage, below the average of the
 same vessel under the late law, this must impair the object of statistical
 returns, and injure the harbours, piers, and docks, maintained for shipping,
 while it reduces the charges and light dues only, and is consequently very

 popular with shipowners.

    Two years' experience in the practical working of the present tonnage

 measurement and registration system, has proved deficient and non-effective
 for the attainment of most of the objects of public utility sought for.

    The advantages of internal over external measurement have been stated to
 be, that inasmuch as the greatest number of cargoes carried by our mer-
 chant shipping consist of stowage goods, not doad weight, equal to at least
 three-fourths of the whole, and as ships' sides and bottoms are of various
 scantlings and thickness, and are constructed of materials of different weight,
 external measurement would give advantage to some ships over other's, of

 i.5 to 20 per cent.
      This is, however, not the fact, as an examination into the trade returns of

 1850 exhibits the following results of the trade of the United Kingdom,
 amounting to 10,760,297 tons of imports and exports; of which 7,483,214
 tons, or 69^ per cent, were of heavy goods (coal, metal, grain, and sugar),
 and 3,277,083 or 30^ per cent, of light goods, of which a timber-built ship

 will carry 10 per cent, less than iron vessels.
     With respect to the working of the Act of 1854, it appears that in Sep-

 tember 1855, a great many vessels were remeasured under the new act, it
 being found that the Rule No. 1 for internal measurement reduces the register
  tonnage from 5 to 10 per cent., an important saving of dock and light dues
  to coasting steamers, besides some increase in the deduction for engine-room;
  while by Rule No. 2, for external girthing, the gross tonnage was increased
 5 per cent, on the late measurement, and ranged from 5 to 15 per cent, more
 than by Rule No. 1.
--86 REPORT 1857.

   The war caused a great demand for screw steamers hired by the ton, and
induced the numerous remeasurements under the new act ; thus the anoma-
lies of our tonnage laws are exemplified by there being three or four different
measurements in use, all nearly equally indefinite as to the real built effi-

ciency or tonnage capacity of vessels transferred.

 --With respect to the fixing the load limit ; at present we can obtain from

the builder his construction load line and launching draught, and if in addi-
tion we obtain the draught of water, the scale of displacement, and area of
midship section, we have sufficient data for assigning a proper limit of
loading, and marking it on the register as in Appendix B.

    Should the builder assign a load draft and displacement, such as nautical

science may not justify, and as the safety limit must also depend much on

the proportions and form of the vessel, the load draught of water and height

--of freeboard may be ascertained as follows : For example, take one-

twentieth of the length, one-fifth of the breadth, one-fifth of the depth, and

--divide by three the result will be the safety freeboard measured from the

deck or gunwale and the mean draft of load water, which should be men-
tioned in the register and never exceeded.

    In conclusion, all that is requisite is, to alter the three clauses given in

the present act of 1854, as it embodies the principles recommended by the
Tonnage Committee of 1849 (and contained in the Bill of 1850), together
with all the advantages derived from internal measurement, as given in the
present act ; and bases the register tonnage on the mean of the external
bulk and internal space, thereby affording internal capacity and a displace-
ment measurement, from which the weight of cargo carried could be as-

certained.

Alterations w? the Clauses of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1854, appertaining
    to the Measurement of Ships for Tonnage, proposed by A. Henderson *.

    Clause 20. Throughout the following rules the tonnage deck shall be
taken to the upper deck in ships which have less than three decks, and to
be the second deck from below in all other ships; and in carrying such
rules into effect all fractions of feet shall be expressed in decimals. " It
being considered that the equitable basis on which charges for dock, light,
harbour, and other dues should be made, is that of the entire cubical con-
tents or external bulk to the medium height of the tonnage deck, together
with the internal space or capacity under the tonnage deck (within the
ceiling planking, exclusive of lower deck beams and fixtures of hull); the
mean of the two being taken as the basis of registered tonnage. These
quantities to be expressed in cubic feet and decimals on the register and
certificate. The difference between the external bulk and internal space to
 be considered the cubical contents of the hull of the vessel ; the per centage
 or ratio the cubic contents of the hull bear to that of the internal capacity,
 and of that quantity to the bulk, giving a fair criterion of the relative capa-
 city of timber and iron ships for light goods and passengers."

    Clause 21. The tonnage of every ship to be registered, with the excep-
 tions mentioned in the next section, shall, previously to her being registered,
 be ascertained by the l"ollowing rules hereinafter called Rule I. " for External
 Measurement and Internal Measurement "; and the tonnage of every ship to
 which such rule can be applied, whether she is about to be registered or not,
 shall be ascertained by the same rule.

    Rule I 1. Measure the length of the ship in a straight line along the
upper side of the tonnage deck from the inside of the inner plank (average
thickness), at the side of the stem to the inside of the midship stern timber
or plank there, as the case may be (average thickness), deducting from this
length what is due to the rake of the bow in the thickness of the deck and
what is due to the rake of the stern timber in the thickness of the deck, and
also what is due to the rake of the stern timber in one-third of the round of
the beam ; to be termed the length for tonnage. " The height for tonnage to
be taken from a base line at the underside of the false keel to the medium
height of the tonnage deck. The breadth for tonnage to be the extreme

breadth, exclusive of doubling. Divide the length so taken into the follow-
ing number of vertical sections required for the measurement of transverse

areas at nearly equal distant divisional points."

ing 120 feet, " into sections for measuring five transverse areas."

Class 3. Ships of which the tonnage deck is above 120 feet, not exceeding

greatest breadth of the ship to the outside of the outer planking or wales,

and then, having first marked on the outside of the ship on both sides thereof

the height of the tonnage deck at the ship's sides, girt the ship at the greatest

breadth in a direction perpendicular to the keel from the height so marked

on the other side by passing a chain under the keel ; to half the girth thus
taken add half the main breadth ; square the sum ; multiply the result by

the length of the ship taken as aforesaid ; then multiply this product by the

factor '0018 (eighteen ten-thousandths) in the case of ships built of wood,

and by '0021 (twenty-one ten-thousandths) in the case of ships built of iron,
and the product shall be deemed the register tonnage of the ship, subject to
the additions and deductions hereinafter mentioned.

2. If there be a break, a poop, or other closed-in space on the upper deck,

the tonnage of such space shall be ascertained by multiplying together the
mean length, breadth and depth of such space, and dividing the product by

100, and the quotient so obtained shall be deemed to be the tonnage of such

space, and shall, subject to the deduction for a closed-in forecastle mentioned

in Rule I., be added to the tonnage of the ship under the tonnage-deck as-

certained as aforesaid ; and if the ship has three or more decks, the tonnage

of each space between decks above the tonnage-deck shall be ascertained in
the same manner as for the like spaces in Rule I., and added to the tonnage

aforesaid.

                        In answer to the Circular of Nov. 6th, 1856.

 My -- Highfield, Birmingham, Feb. 23, 1857.
        Dear Sir, I shall not be able to attend your Committee to-morrow.

   I have considered the questions in Mr. Atherton's printed paper, and I
cannot afford you much help in the form of categorical reply.

   There does not seem to be much disposition on the part of owners of sailing

vessels or steamers to stir against the present system of registration.

   On many grounds, however, I think that every vessel should incur a penalty
90 BEPORT--1857.

·which is loaded so as to sink, below a certain draught of water ; and that her
registered tonnage should comprise the weight of water between her assigned
load draught and that draught which she would have when fit for sea, with
crew and stores and everything on board, except that by which she earns
her freight. Supposing such a principle to be admitted, the method of de-

termining such tonnage would not be difficult.
   I annex an example. But the question at this moment is, how is this

principle of registration to be tested, and, if sound, carried out ?

   The agitation of it, so that the public may some day see they have an

interest in it, must do good, and I shall, tlierefore, be glad to subscribe towards

the expenses of your association.

   Next, as to the unit of HP. When a person wishes to buy an engine, he

need not trouble himself about the nominal HP, but specifying the nature

and extent of the work it is to do, he can bind the engine builder to results.
The contractor, on his part, has his own rules for making the instrument.

It then becomes a question of specific performance between the parties, with
which the public is not concerned. But with the question of the improve-

ment of engines and the improvement of vessels, the public has every con-
cern, and improvement can make but slow and fitful progress when the power
exerted and the power given out in any case are not known, or knov,'n only

to a few persons, and that by special experiment only, and not by stated

performance.

   In the pamphlet I have had printed for private circulation, of which you

have a copy, I have expressed my opinion on this question of the improve-
ments of engines and vessels, and your Committee may probably coincide

in my views.

   I think then, that it is of little consequence to what unit we refer the ex-
pression HP, if in any given case we can know the power exerted ; and it is

the indicator power and its results, including the consumption of fuel, that is

wanted.

   Any measure of power must be incomplete without the weight of the fuel
which is the originator of the power, and in any general expression we must

include the boiler as well as the cjdinder.

   Such expression would consequently mean a given weight moved through

a certain space in a certain time with a certain weight of coal.
   Now, as yet we have no data for such an expression. I must apologise

for so hasty and incomplete a statement, but I would not let the day pass
without an acknowledgment of your note. Having returned home only on

Saturday, and leaving home again tomorrow, I have not at present time to

proceed further with the subjects of the printed letter.

J. Yates, Esq.         I am, Sir, yours truly,

   The builder's displacement scale would furnish these particulars, and it
should be the duty of the Customs Department to check that scale and

verify the facts.

  A table of co-efficients might be constructed on the ratios of length to

breadth, and breadth to draught of water, which would enable every owner
to ascertain the displacement at all draughts.

Memorandum on the Questions submitted in the Circular of Nov, 6th, 1856.

   Having read the papers transmitted with Mr. Wright's letter of the 19th

inst., I have something to qualify in my letter to Mr. Yates of the 23rd of
February, and not much to add to it.

    1st. I concur in the opinion that science has nothing to gain by legislation,
except the repeal of the laws which impede her progress ; and believing that
the interference of authority in things which can be matter of bargain
between man and man must always be pernicious, I would tolerate such in-

terference only where no other security can be had against misdoing. On
these principles I am disposed to let the present system of registration stand

for all purposes of voluntary contract, but I think a shipowner should be
taxed only in the measure in which he can receive freight; and as the dis-
placement is the measure of the freight which a ship can take, it should also
be the measure of tolls and dues. Moreover, as the public ultimately pay
these charges, they are interested in the question.

   In so far also as the system of registration may interfere with the best form
of construction of vessels, it impedes science, in which also the public are

concerned.

   I adhere, however, to my opinion that for each vessel there should be a

draft of water beyond which she should not be loaded, but, instead of a

penalty, I would merely withhold the clearance. On this point, it would be

useful to obtain facts as to any differences of opinion between the govern-
ment agents and the other parties in cases of vessels with passengers.

    I have heard of such differences.

   The case of the Royal Charter is somewhat in point ; after getting into
the Bay of Biscay, she was compelled to return to port to be re-stowed.

   When on board this ship, before she received her cargo, I pointed out to

the authorities of the ship then on board, the risk of such a contingency,

and how to guard against it; for, if I understood the letters of Dr. Scoresby,
(himself a seaman and on board), which appeared in the Times, the ship was
not only two feet too deep but was overweighted in her fore-body. Now, how

 could the underwriters protect themselves in such a case ?

   Would the policy be vitiated ? Was the premium higher in consequence
of such a known contingency as overloading and misleading ?

   How could the second-class passengers, who were represented as washed
--92 REPORT 1857.

out of tlicir bcrtlis, protect themselves beforehand ; and what remedy had

they after the tact, or what compensation ?
   If the displaceiuent principle were adopted, tables might be constructed

for all known forms of vessels, which would give the displacement at any
draught of water, and upon the difference of light and load draught the
dutic's should be payable : this would set at rest the question between sailing

--vessels and steamers.
   Secondly. As to a unit of HP. Here the commercial part of the question

resolves itself into a matter of bargain, and neither buyer nor seller can be
benefited by interference. The buyer has but to specify the work he requires,
and to make his contract accordingly. But the scientific part of the ques-

tion assumes another aspect.
   Improvement can make but slow and fitful progress when the power exerted

and the power given out are known only to a few of the initiated. What
science wants to know in each case is, the indicator power and its results, in-
cluding the consumption of fuel. Any measure of power which does not em-

brace the weight of fuel, which is the originator of the power, must be

incomplete.

Any general expression must include the boiler as well as the cylinder,

and it would mean a given weight moved through a certain space in a cer-

Wetain time, with a certain weight of fuel.     have not as yet data for such

an expression.

   The accompanying pamphlet, which I have had printed for private circu-
lation, may perhaps throw some light upon this subject, and I have marked

the passages bearing on the immediate question of power.

   I have now before me a table printed by the Admiralty last year, and

showing "results of trials made in her Majesty's screw ships and vessels."
These results are useful as far as they go, but they do not go far enough,
and the particulars of the table might be simplified and amended. They
involve a theory, whereas facts alone are wanted. The trials were made in
smooth water only, and do not contain any account of the consumption of

fuel.

  AThe passages marked in the pamphlet and the tables and B will show

how necessary it is to have the performances of vessels and engines at sea,
in order to institute any comparisons towards the deduction of laws, and

that the consumption of fuel is indispensable.

March 24', 1857.  C. R. Moorsom, Rear Admiral.

              No. 8 Mr. James Yates (Member of the CommiUee)-

    To the Shipping Registration Committee of the British Association.

   I am very desirous of directing the attention of the Shipping Registration

Committee to the following considerations :
   The party, if it may be called a party, which we considered as opposed to

ourselves, and which" we may probably regard as represented by Mr. G.
Moorsom, do not appear to be in such entire opposition as may at first be
imagined, and certainly, we are not entirely opposed to them. On the con-
trary, we appear to agree in the most important and fundamental points.

  We1. aorree in regard to the necessity of internal measurement as an

element of tonnage registration, being the space inside a vessel, or under
cover, which may be used to carry either cargo or passengers.

  We2. agree in regard to Sterling's rule as a recognized method of ad-

measurement, available for calculating the entire contents of a ship of any

form, measured either internally or externally.
ON THE MEASUREMENT OF SHIPS FOR TONNAGE.  93

   We3. agree that neither internal nor external measurement does, of itself,

provide any security against the construction of weak thin-sided ships,

   We4. agree with the remarks in Mr. Moorsom's Treatise on Tonnage, in

regard to the great advantages of the registration of displacement, or outward
measurement between the light and load water-lines, as showing the actual
weight which any vessel will carry.

    These advantages cannot be more distinctly stated than they are by Mr.
Moorsom, in the following remarks on the measurement of keels, and the
method of marking the load water-line with nails, according to weights
actually placed on board, as prescribed by 6 and 7 William and Mary, a.d.
1694, and by 15 George III. c. 27.

    " This being a measure of pure and unerring displacement, free from the
possibility of evasion, and giving the exact dead weight of the cargo shipped,

whatever may be the form or construction of the vessel, it offers no induce-
ment to the building of one kind of form more than another; and the conse-
quence is, that many of these peculiar vessels are remarkable for their sailing

capabilities.

    "Although the process of 'admeasuring and marking,' to which these

vessels are still legally directed to be submitted, involve neither the taking

of measurements nor computation, and can therefore, it may be supposed,
scarcely be termed a mode of admeasurement in the usual acceptation of the

operation ; yet it is, nevertheless, essentially and absolutely, the most correct
measurement possible of the displacement, or external cubature of that part
of the vessel which lies, or is contained, between the light and load lines of
floatation, that is, of the cargo shipped ; and is, therefore, not only an assu-
rance of the security of the public revenue to be derived from the export of
coals, but is found also to tend greatly to the general accommodation of the
trade in which these vessels are engaged ; and from what has been already

predicated of their sailing capabilities, the process is, moreover, an eminent

and satisfactory, though it may appear an humble example, that an operation

founded on truth, without the possibility of evasion, is an operation without
influence in the formation of ill-formed vessels*."

    In a subsequent chapter, Mr. Moorsom treats with great ability the sub-
ject of displacement, showing how it is in practice calculated by Sterling's
rule, and with how great advantage this registration of displacement may be
applied to merchant ships, as is already done in men-of-war by recording the
scale of displacement of all ships in the Royal Navy. See ch. V., p. 113-
148. These statements of Mr. Moorsom clearly establish the practicability
of ascertaining the weight that ships will carry as based on the measurement
of displacement, and recording the same, together with the measurement of

internal roomage.

    5. Another principle of the utmost importance, in which, I trust, we are
agreed, and with the statement of which I shall conclude these remarks, is,
that the measurement of tonnage should be international, in other words,
that, as far as possible, it should be the same for all nations, and adopted
with the consent of all. Mr. Moorsom asserts the value of the principle, and
quotes an American author, GriflSths, a ship-builder of great experience,

who entertains the same cosmopolitan views. He quotes that admirable

memorial of the Council of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts,
Manufactures, and Commerce, which recommends to the Lords of the Trea-
sury, A.u. 1853, the consideration of the best means of promoting the adop-
tion throughout the world of a uniform decimal system of measures, weights,

   * A' Brief Review and Analysis of the Laws for the Admeasurement of Tonnage,' by G.

Moorsom. 2nd edition. London, 1853, pp. 15, 16.

and coins, and which especially insists on the great advantage and conve-
nience of the Metrical System. As Mr. Moorsom also alludes, in encoura-

ging language, to the sentiments " of our active-minded Transatlantic rivals,"

I will add, that not a few of the most distinguished among them have urged

upon their government an examination of the merits of the same system*.
Moreover, Mr. Allan Gilmour points out the necessity " of having a law,

under which the tonnage of all vessels entering our ports, whether British or
foreign, shall be computed in the same wayf ."

   In pursuance of these "cosmopolitan views" of Mr. Moorsom and Mr.

Gilmour, I wish to offer some considerations in favour of the adoption of the

metrical ton in place of the British ton, for the registration of the weight ton-

nage of ships. It is probable that this mode of registration, if adopted by Great

Britain, would lead in a short time to perfect uniformity throughout the world.

The metrical ton of 1000 kilogrammes is now recognised, and in part practi-

cally adopted by a considerable number of the principal mercantile nations. It
is established in France, Belgium, Holland, Prussia, Hamburg and the other

Hanseatic ports, Denmark, the kingdom of Sardinia, Lombardy, Algeria,

Greece, and several South American States. Its adoption after a few years

has been decreed by the governments of Spain and Portugal.

Besides Great Britain and its dependencies, the only commercial nations

of importance, which do not already use the metrical ton, are the United

States of America, Russia, Sweden, Turkey, and Egypt. There can be no

doubt that these latter countries would adopt it, if Great Britain led the way.

The metrical ton being the weight of a cubic metre of water equal to 1000

kilo"-rammes, while the British ton is nearly 1015 kilogrammes, or 1^ per

cent in excess, it is evident that no objection can arise from the adoption of

the former as the unit of ship's tonnage by weight except the temporary in-
Aconvenience which accompanies every change whatsoever.
                                                            ship of 1000

tons British weight would simply be 1015 metrical tons.

According to a return issued by the Board of Trade, the exports from the

United Kingdom in 1855, consisting of British and Irish produce and manu-

factures, amounted in value to £95,688,085, or nearly £96,000,000. The

exports, are as follows :                                £

Thus, the portion of these exports sent to countries using the metrical

Aton amounts to above s628,000,000.  considerable proportion of the

countries to which the remaining 3668,000,000 of goods were exported
does not use either the English or the metrical ton, but some other weight.
So large a proportion of our foreign commerce being already carried on with
nations using the metrical ton, it appears highly probable that the adoption by

Great Britain of the metrical ton as the unit of weight tonnage, would speedily
lead to its universal adoption throughout the world. Nor can it be questioned,

that this would be a most proper adjunct to the recent alteration of the Navi-

gation Law, by which the ships of all countries are permitted to carry goods

Aand passengers to and from Great Britain with unrestricted freedom.

common method of computing the carrying powers of ships, would be a

manifest and indisputable advantage. For statistical information, the adop-
tion of the metrical ton weight is indispensable. At two great statistical
congresses, Brussels, 1853, and Paris, 1855, it was recommended that the

weights and measures of the Metrical System should be universally employed

as common terms of comparison, reference being made more especially to the

tonnage of ships*.

Let us now consider the advantages of the metre as a linear measure, and

of the metrical ton based upon it, independently of their extensive adoption

throughout the world. According to the English method, the measures of

length are generally computed in feet, inches, and eighths of an inch ; or, if
recourse is had to decimals, as directed by the late Mercantile Shipping Act,
in feet and hundredths of a foot. The use of a measuring-line, divided into

metres and centimetres, appears to present at least equal advantages, and

would be simple, easy, and commodious in the extreme for tonnage measure-

ments, having all the recommendations of a decimal system.

If the metrical ton be adopted as the base of ships' tonnage, the displace-

ment between the light and load water-lines, expressed in cubic metres and

centimetres, will give the metrical tonnage without any further trouble and

with perfect exactness, because a metrical ton is the weight of a cubic metre

of water. This remarkable facility is obtained, because in constructing the

Met-ical System, care was taken to adjust the weights so that they might

have a direct and simple relation to the measures. In the English weights

and measures this principle has been disregarded.

Suppose now that we follow the new law, the Mercantile Shipping Act of

1 854, which, however, is never likely to extend itself to the world at large,
because in this law " the ton " is a palpable misnomer, not being a weight of

any kind, but a certain extent of internal space. Under this law the cubic

contents of every part of a vessel, adapted to carry passengers or cargo, are

ascertained either by Stei'ling's rule or some other approved formula, and
are expressed in cubic feet. The number of cubic feet is then divided by

100, this number having been adopted as the divisor in order to assimilate
the new tonnage registration to the former tonnage registration.

If we apply the metre as the unit of linear measure, we shall find the in-

ternal space in cubic metres instead of cubic feet, and we can easily reduce

the one measure to the other, because a cubic metre being equal to 25'32
cubic feet, the number of cubic metres multiplied by the decimal '3532, will
give the number of tons measure at the rate of 100 cubic feet to the ton,
according to the principle of the new law.

   It thus appears tliat the metrical ton, differing from the British weight of
the same name only by about 15 parts in 1000, whereby a ship capable of

carrying 1000 tons weight British, would carry 1015 metrical tons, and be
registered accordingly, recommends itself, not only by its use among many
of the chief trading nations, but by its adaptation to the requirements of in-
ternational commerce, to the convenience of mariners, and, most especially,
to the measurement and registration of vessels of all kinds as respects their
capabilities for carrying weight : to which it must be added, that the system
of weights and measures to which this ton belongs, and which is every year
extending through the world, is tlie only system which appears at all likely
to become universal ; so that tiie metrical ton weight must be adopted as the
basis of tonnage registration, if international tonnage is to be pursued as an
indispensable part of a really good method.

Rejiort on the Temperature of some Deep Mines in Cornwall.

           By Robert Were Fox, F.R.S., G.S.

In compliance with the request of the Committee of the British Association,
I have had further experiments made on the temperature of some deep mines
in Cornwall by careful observers, and I have now to report the results of
their investigations*. But before I do this, it may perhaps be well to allude
to the method of working, or rather exploring a metalliferous vein or "lode"
in this county. The horizontal bearing of most of the lodes is from east to
west, or rather from northward of east to southward of west; and they
descend into the earth to an unknown depth, and much more often in an
inclined than a. vertical direction, intersecting the different rocks which occur
in their courses. The miners work a lode by means of shafts, and galleries or
"levels," which latter, being on the course of the lode, do not usually succeed

each other in a vertical, but in an inclined direction.

FiK. 1.  Fis. 2.

   Let fig. I, a,h, represent a north and south section of a lode inclined to-
wards the north ; c, d an engine-shaft through which the water is pumped

   * I am indebted to my friend \YilIiani Hustler of Rosemorryn, near Falmouth, for the

--results obtained iu the United Mines, and most of those in Fowey Consols ; to Captain
--J. Puckey, Manager of Fowey and Par Consols, for experiments in those mines ; to Captain

Charles Thomas, Manager of Dolcoath, for an experiment there; to Captain Jennings of
Tresavean, for some made in that mine in 1853 ; and to Henry Peters of Lanner, near Red-
ruth, for the other experiments in Dolcoath, iu Levant, and Cotallack Mines.

up to the adit e,/, from the bottom or "sump" d(hgs. I & 2), and from

cisterns placed at various intervals in the shaft, the water which enters the
levels being conducted into the cisterns, and thereby prevented from falling

to the bottom of the shaft. From the adit, the water is discharged into a
valley, or near the sea shore. The horizontal lines in fig. 1 represent " cross-
cuts" or N. and S. levels, which connect the engine-shaft with the levels at
right angles to them, as shown in fig. 2. These latter, on the course of the
lode, are usually about ten fathoms apart, and they are connected together
by many short shafts inclined with the lode. There are also other shafts
from the surface to the deep levels, through which the ore is drawn up,

ventilation promoted, &c. In most of the deep mines several lodes are
worked, and each by means of a similar series of levels, shafts, &c., which
are connected with the former series by " cross-cuts," so that one engine-shaft

may often serve for two or more lodes. The deepest levels in a mine are
generally much less extended than those above them, as shown in fig. 2, and
the quantity of water in them is often comparatively small, the upper water
being in a great degree cut off by the superior levels, and conveyed to the
cisterns through the latter. The temperature of the water that flows into

the ends of the deepest levels is generally as high, or nearly so, as that of the

rocks and lode, and more often higher, which it may be presumed it would
not be if much of the upper water were mixed with it. Most of the experi-
ments were made at or near the ends of the deepest level in each of the

respective mines, as at E. and W., fig. 2.

   The thermometers employed were obtained for me by Professor Phillips,

from Casella, and were, I need scarcely say, accurately graduated.
    They were placed in holes from 15 to 20 inches deep in the rocks and

lodes, which were carefully closed up with clay, tow, or cotton. After
the thermometers had been so left from half an hour to an hour, they
were withdrawn for an instant for the temperature to be read off, and
were often again left in the holes for some time longer ; but as no further
change was observed at the second reading, this precaution was latterly

dispensed with.
    In taking the temperature of the water, the most copious springs at their

sources or influx into the levels were selected, if near the stations where the
other observations were made ; and the temperature of the surrounding air

was also ascertained.
   The mines visited are situated in different parts of the county, ranging

from near Fowey, to St. Just, a little to the north of the Laud's End, a distance

of about fifty miles.

   To begin with Fowey Consols* copper mine, situated near Fowey, as

being the most easterly one.
   The deepest level in this mine was reported to be 328 fathoms under the

surface, and about 298 fathoms below the sea-level ; but the influx of water
interfered with any experiments being made in this part of the mine, which
is the more to be regretted, as perhaps there are few if any mines elsewhere
so deep in reference to the level of the sea, although there are many deeper

from the surface of the ground.
   At 268 fathoms below the surface, water issued from a copper lode at

96°'5 Fahr. ; the lode * was 95°'5 and the air 95°'2 : no persons at work near

the place.

    In a level 288 fathoms deep, another lode was Q-i", the adjoining rock
93", and the air 91°'5: no water, and the containing rock "killas."

    Par Consols is situated near Par on the shores of the English Channel, and
produces copper and tin in " killas." Its deepest level, when visited, was
208 fathoms from the surface, and about 178 fathoms under the sea-level:
the lode in it was at 84°, the rock 84-°, and the air 82°. The part of this mine
which produces tin was 128 fathoms beneath the surface at its deepest level,
and there the lode was at 74'°, the rock near the lode 74°, the air 75°, and
the water 72°.

   The United Mines in the parish of Gwennap have yielded much copper
ore in " killas." At the eastern end of a level, 255 fathoms under the surface,
and nearly 200 fathoms below the sea-level, a stream of water gushing out of
a rich copper lode, called the north lode, was lately found to be at the tem-
perature of 116° Fahr., and the neighbouring rock and air were at 106°. In
another level, also 255 fathoms deep, worked on a parallel lode, southward of
the former, in which there was very little water, the rock was 82°'5, and the

air 82°.

    I have had no recent information relative to the temperature at the bottom
 of the mine, but in 1853 the rock was 94°, the air 90°, and the depth 275
fathoms. At that date the stream of water in the eastern end of the level,
255 fathoms deep, was at 109°, or 7° less than now that the level has been
further extended. In 1846, when the level was still less advanced towards
 the east, the spring of water, discharging as was then estimated 94 gallons
in a minute, was at 106°"3, and the air 104°'2. At that time I examined

some of the water and found 15 grains of common salt and chloride of lime

 in a quarter of a pint of it, in nearly equal proportions ; but no metallic salt
 could be detected. This mine is several miles from the sea.

    In 1853 I had some observations repeated in Tresavean, to ascertain in
 what proportion the temperature had increased with the increased depth
 since 1837. This mine is in the parish of Stythians, about eight miles to
 the N.W. of Falmouth, and has been very productive of copper, found mostly
 in granite, and but very little in killas. The bottom level was 352 fathoms,
 or 2112 feet under the surface, which is more than any other mine in Corn-
 wall, and about 1750 feet below the sea-level, or rather less in this respect
 than Fowey Consols. The lode in this deep level, at its eastern extremity,
 was at 90°"5, the thermometer having been long kept in a dry hole, closed
 at the top; the contiguous granite 91°*5, the hole rather moist, the air
 91°*5, and a small spring of water flowing from the lode into the level, 93°'5.
 In 1837 the deepest level in this mine was 262 fathoms, or 1572 feet beneath
 the surface, and the rock there was then found at 82°-5.

     Dolcoath, in the pari>h of Camborne, has been a very productive mine of
 copper and tin ores, and now yields much of the latter from its deepest parts,
 the containing rock there being granite, with killas nearer the surface. The
 deepest level on the north lode was 272 fathoms below the surface, and ex-
 tended only about four fathoms on each side of the engine-shaft. The rock
 near the eastern end of this level was at 73°*5, the air 71°*7, and the water
 73°. At tlie western end the rock was 73° on one side of the level, and 73°*5
 on the other, the air 73°, and the water, the quantity of which was leri/ small,
 72°'7. At about three fathoms further south, and the same depth, another

    * When the temperature of the rods or of the lodes is mentioned in this Report, it is

 meant that the thermometers were placed in holes in them for half an hour or more, and
 that the other precautions already referred to were observed.

  lode was worked, the level extending to about fourteen fathoms to the west-
  ward of the engine-shaft. There the granite was found to be at 79°'5, and
 the water, which was much more abundant than in the other level, 79°'5,

 while the air was at 78°. Two men at a time worked near each of the
 stations in both levels. The pumps discharged only about 190 gallons of

  water per minute from the mine.
     In 1821-1822 the deepest level in Dolcoath was 230 fathoms from the

 surface, and I then had an accurate thermometer, 4 feet long, kept in it
 more than a year and a half, with the bulb sunk 3 feet in the lode, and
 it varied from 75° and 75°*5 to 76°*5 and 77° ; an occasional influx of water
 having caused a temporary rise of the mercury to the extent of a degree or
 more. This temperature being from two to three degrees higher than the
 rock, was lately found by H. Peters to be at an increased depth of 42 fathoms :
 I begged Captain Charles Thomas, the manager of the mine, to have a ther-
 mometer left for some days in a hole in the rock near one of the ends of the
 deepest level on the north lode. This he has done, and he reports that
 the temperature did not vary from 73°, although the thermometer was left
 there a week, and the top of the hole was well closed, thus confirming
 H. Peters' observations.

     The water near the bottom of the engine-shaft in 1822 was at 82°, at 239
 fathoms below the surface, and this year (1857) it was at 82°-5, at 278

 fathoms deep.
     Levant copper and tin mine, in St. Just parish, is nearly twenty miles to

 the west of Dolcoath, and is close to the sea. Its deepest level is 255
 fathoms below the surface of the ground, and nearly 230 fathoms beneath
 the sea-level, having been horizontally extended under it through killas.
 The temperature of the rock near the end of this level was 84°'7 on one side

 of the latter, and 85°-5 on the other ; the water 85°'5, and the air 85°. No
 men had been employed in this level for some time. There was very little

 water there, and indeed only about 60 or 70 gallons were discharged per
 minute from the mine.

    In 1853 the temperature of the rock in this level, when it was not ex-
 tended so far westward under the sea, was reported to me to be 87°> and the
 granite rock at the same level, eastward of the shaft, 74°.

     Botallack copper and tin mine is situated at the north-western extremity
 of Cornwall, in the parish of St. Just, and the engine-house is built on a
 rock which is washed by the sea. The western levels have been worked
 through killas far under the Atlantic, one of them extending more than half

-a mile from the shore. Two men and a boy were employed in the deepest

 level, which was less advanced from the shore. It was 188 fathoms below
 the ground, and about 180 fathoms under the sea-level. The rock near the
 end of the level was 79° on one side of it, and 79°*5 on the other, the air 81°
 no water at that station, and but little comparatively in the mine.

     The foregoing results exhibit great differences in the rates of increase in
 the temperature in different mines, and also in different parts of the same
 mine. If we arrange the mines in the order of their respective depths, in-
 cluding those only in which experiments were made in the rocks or lodes at

 their deepest levels, the following will be the ratios in feet, in descending
 from the surface, in which the temperature was augmented one degree Fahr.
 from 50°, the mean temperature of the climate.

magnesia ; no iron or copper." All these mines are several miles from the sea.
The water from the deepest level in Levant and Botallack also contained

some common salt, and was slightly saline to the taste ; but the proportion
was much less than might have been expected in excavations extending so

far under the sea. I have examined the water from numerous mines, taken
immediately from the springs at their entrance from the veins into the levels,
and I have not detected the presence of any metal, except in some instances
a very little sulphate of iron, and traces of the sulphate of zinc, on two or

three occasions. On the other hand, it may be observed, that the water not

coming directly from the springs, but which is collected more or less in

pools in the levels, often contains metallic salts derived from the ores in

the levels broken from the lodes, and exposed for a time in heaps to the
joint action of air and water.

   The phenomena observed in mineral veins, however, afford strong pre-
sumptive evidence that the water circulating through them has, from time to
time, varied much in its properties, sometimes depositing minerals, and at
others decomposing them.

   Captain J. Puckey has, at my request, made an experiment on the tem-
perature of the rock at the end of a "cross-cut" in Fowey Consols. The

end was dry, 60 fathoms from the lode, distant from other workings, and 140

fathoms deep. He thinks that they will have to extend the cross-cut 20
fathoms further to intersect another lode. The thermometer remained an

hour in a hole of the rock, the top of which was closed with clay ; and on
being withdrawn, the mercury was found at 82°, and in the air it stood at 78°.
Captain John Kitto has also made experiments in Swanpool lead mine near
Falmouth; temperature of rock 58° at the end of a dry cross-cut, 34 fathoms
northward of the lode, and 55 fathoms deep. In another cross-cut, the end
of which is 14 fathoms to the south of the lode, and 60 fathoms below the
surface, the rock was at 60°, air 64°, and the water 59°. The presence of
the latter probably indicated the proximity of another lode. This mine is

80 fathoms deep, and both the mines are in killas.
   I may remark, in conclusion, that on comparing the specific gravities of

pieces of different rocks taken from the deepest parts of some of the mines,
with others of the same kind occurring at or near the surface, I have not
found any decided differences between them in this respect.

Report on the Marine Zoology of Strangford Lough, County Down,

   and corresponding part of the Irish Channel. By G. Dicki e, M.D.,

    Professor of Natural History, Queen's College, Belfast.

The entrance to Strangford Lough is less than two miles in breadth ; it gra-

dually becomes narrower, forming a channel half a mile broad with a length
of about three miles. The tidal current in this channel is estimated as
havino- a velocity of nine miles per hour ; as a consequence of such pecu-
liarities, we find near Portaferry a depth of twenty-nine to thirty-five fathoms
in the centre of the channel, and a gradual slope upwards from mid-channel
to both shores. The bottom, in the deepest part, consists of rock with large
and small stones interspersed ; near the shore we find a mixture of small
stones and gravel, and in the small bays sand or mud, or both intermixed.

    The wider expansion of the Lough itself presents very much the same

characteristics of bottom, with this difference, that the proportion of hard

material is very much less, a large part consisting of mud. These pecu-

liarities give rise to corresponding differences in the distribution of animal

 life, as the following facts testify :

    The fauna of parts of Strangford Lough has been examined by the late
         ON THE MARINE ZOOLOGY OF STRANGFOBD LOUGH. 105

Mr. Thompson and Mr. Hyndman, during excursions in 1832, 184'6, and
1851. Some of the results of these dredgings, found among the papers of
Mr. Thompson, will be given separately ; the exact places dredged by these
gentlemen are not in every case recorded.

   About the middle of June of the present year (1857) I began the exa-
mination of the Lough ; fortunately the weather was so favourable that
during fifteen days' stay at Portaferry, twelve dredging excursions were
made, each occupying five to eight hours. At the end of the first week. I
was joined by E. Waller, Esq., and received valuable aid from him in

recording the lists of species.

   It may be necessary to state that species designated as common or very
common are those of which a considerable number of specimens were brought
up at every haul of the dredge ; of those called rare, not more than four or

five were procured, either at one haul or as the result of several trials ; the
species marked very rare, are those of which not more than four or five

specimens (generally not so many) were found among the entire products
of all the excursions : as examples, may be mentioned Chemnitzia scalaris and

Terebratula caput-serpentis.

   These symbols have been used for brevity's sake :

    In the open channel opposite to the entrance of Strangford Lough, the
results of dredging indicated very regular distribution of materials through-
out a distance of seven miles from the bar.

  -- --1. From the bar to one mile more or less large stones with a mixture of
-- --fragments about the size of the fist.

   2. Two miles more or less from the bar, gravel, small stones, and

-- --shell sand.
   3. Three miles more or less from the bar, gravel with dead and living

moUusca, and fine debris of shells.
   4. Four to five miles from the bar, sand and mud, with a smaller pro-

portion of dead and living mollusca.

  -- --5. Six miles more or less from the bar, fine mud and sand.

 -- --6. Seven miles from the bar more or less fine black tenacious mud,

with one living bivalve (^Syndosmya intermedia), and Brissus lyrifer.
   It need scarcely be stated, that the powerful currents which issue from the

narrow opening of the Lough, in some measure account for these pecu-
liarities, the lightest materials being carried farthest and deposited at a

distance from the bar.

Along with these a single living specimen of the rare Brissus lyrifer was

procured.

   In Strangford Lough 103 species (dead or living) were dredged : 58 Bi-
valves and 45 Univalves. The locality which produced the largest number

is near the junction of the narrow channel with the wider part of the Lough
itself, viz. Castle Ward Bay; the general result being

   The next locality worth mentioning is Wellstream Bay, about two miles
within the wider part of the Lough, or that distance from the upper end of
the narrow channel, and five to six miles from the sea. Contrasted with the
former locality, the number of species is reduced to one-half, viz.

   In the widest part of the Lough, near its centre, and farther from the sea
than the previous locality, we find a still greater reduction in the number:

   In the open Irish Channel, outside the Lough, 96 species were dredged,

in the following proportions :

   It may be worthy of notice, that the dead shells found in the outside
Channel, and those dredged in the Lough, presented an aspect so different,
that if the two were mixed together, I could easily point out those found in
the one or the other locality. Those dredged at sea were peculiarly fresh in

external appearance, and generally retained their original consistence, and
in many cases their colour ; whereas those found in the Lough had almost
universally lost their colour, and in many instances were so decayed that
they could be easily crushed by the fingers.

   On taking a general view of the MoUuscan fauna of Strangford and that

of the Irish Channel opposite its entrance, we remark the absence of species
belonging to the Lusitanian and South British typesf, and the general oc-
currence of those of the European type, with a large proportion of those
called Celtic. Some of those considered as more peculiarly British (British
type), are also not uncommon, as Trochus Montagui, T. millegranus, Pecten
tigrinus. Those of the Atlantic type are generally rare, the only species
found in abundance being Cerithiimi reticulatum, Mangelia gracilis, and
Psammobia tellinella ; others being rare, as Cerithium adversum, Circe mi-
nima, Fissurella reticulata, JSIatica sordida, Terebratula caput-serpentis, &c.
Those of the Boreal type are represented by Cyprina Islandica, which is
not uncommon, and by a few others which are rare, as Cardiuvi suecicum.
Crania anomala, Leda caudata, Syndosmya intermedia, and Trichotropis

borealis.

   The general conclusion is, that the Mollusca recorded here belong mainly
to the European and Celtic types, with a moderate proportion of species be-
longing to the Atlantic type, and a very few Boreal forms.

   * Species procured by the dredge only are recorded here;      littoral  species, commoQ
everywhere, are not included.

Suggestions for Statistical Inquiry into the extent to which Mercantile
   Steam Transport Economy is affected by the Constructive Type of
   Shipping, as respects the Projjortions of Length, Breadth, and

   Depth. By Charles Atherton, ChiefEngineer of Her Majesty's

   Dockyard, Woolwich.

At the Cheltenham Meeting of the British Association in August 1856, I

had the honour to present a paper on " Mercantile Steam TransportEconomy."
The principal objects of that paper were, in the first place, to expose the
difficulty which attends all investigation and even all discussion on maritime

affairs, in consequence of the technical terms in which shipping, especially

steam shipping, is spoken of, and officially registered as respects the size or
magnitude of vessels and machinery, having no definite meaning expressive

of the capability of ships for carrying weight of cargo, or the capability of
the machinery for the production of working power ; and in the second place,
after getting the better of the foregoing difficulty by rejecting the records of

tonnage and nominal horse-power as being indefinite, and basing my calcu-

lations on load displacement, as expressing the actual magnitude and weight
of the mass propelled through the water, and assigning an arbitrary but defi-
nite amount of working power based on indicator measurement to the term
horse-power, and availing myself of maritime statistics already published as
to the actual performances of vessels, and of the received laws which are re-
cognized as expressing the mutual relations of displacement, power, and speed
under definite conditions of practical application, I was enabled to demon-
strate approximately the proportional increased rate of pecuniary cost which

attends an increased rateof speed at which cargo per ton weight may be con-

veyed by steam-ships of any definite size and type, according to the length
of passage and speed that may be required : for example, assuming a passage
of 3250 nautical miles to be performed by a vessel of 2500 tons load dis-
placement, and of which the coefficients of dynamic duty were assumed to be

known and equal, and of a comparatively high order, the vessels respectively
being fitted for speeds of 8, 10, and 12 knots per hour, it was shown that the
cost of transport per ton weight at the speed of 12 knots per hour would be
about 50 per cent, above the cost that would be incurred by a speed of
 10 knots, and about 100 per cent., or double the cost incurred by a speed of
       ON MERCANTILE STEAM TRANSPORT ECONOMY.                         11^

8 knots ; and if the vessels be of a certain comparatively inferior type of
build, as indicated by a lower coefficient, but still of such type as is commonly

employed, the rate of freight per ton weight of cargo conveyed at the 12 knots'

speed on the passage referred to, was found to be about double the rate if

conveyed at the speed of 10 knots per hour, and about three times the rate

incurred by a speed of 8 knots an hour.

Applying this estimated difference of cost incurred by difference of type

to the aggregate trade of the country, as shown by the statistical returns of

the Customs' House, it was suggested that the pecuniary interest of the great
paymaster " the public," is involved to the extent of millions per annum,

simply by the difference of type of build and condition of the ships and

engines, and administrative management by which the foreign trade of the

country, as respects transport, may be prosecuted. These points of my

former paper are now referred to by way of introduction to the following

paper, in which it is purposed to continue the subject-matter of my former

dissertation, by showing the extent to which the weight-carrying capability
of ships of given tonnage, whether rated by the gross register tonnage (new

measure), under the Merchant Shipping Act of ISo't, or by the tonnage
builders' measure O.M. (also commonly called " burden," and still generally

in use, though legally superseded in 1835), is dependent on the relative pro-

portions of length, breadth, and depth to which ships may be constructed

and it is submitted for the consideration of the Association that this point of

inquiry comes to be of special importance, seeing that the tendency of the
present times to build vessels of great magnitude as respects length and

breadth, whilst the load«draught is restricted by local circumstances within
the definite limit of the minimum depth of water of the ports to be fre-

quented, has a direct tendency to involve a condition of things as respects
proportions of build adverse to public interests, for the public will have

to bear the brunt of freight charges proportional to the cost expenses that

Wemay be incurred in the general administration of shipping affairs.  may

just as well assert that the public have no interest in the efficiency of our
army and navy, as that it has no interest in the efficiency of our commercial
shipping. Rates of freight (excepting on occasions of national emergency)

must be ruled in the aggregate by the general average cost at which the
general service of mercantile transport is actually performed, whether it be

well or ill performed ; and the general introduction of proportions of build
which can only perform their service at high rates of freight above the prime

cost rates which would duly remunerate vessels of superior type, involves
pecuniary considerations that may well form the subject of special statistical
inquiry to be prosecuted at the instance of the British Association. The
application of statistical science in connexion with shipping as a means of

inquiry into the principles of Mercantile Steam Transport Economy, is, I may
say, a new subject of inquiry, to which the British Association, and, I must
add, the Society for the Promotion of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce,
have given public vitality. The question of Maritime Transport Economy

has a bearing on public interests analogous to the operation of the rail and

the telegraph.

  A further object of this paper is, that by means of the following Table (A),

·which has been prepared to show the mutual relations which subsist in ships
of given variations of build between Tonnage Builders' Measurement O.M.,

Gross Register Tonnage, Weight Tonnage, or the capability of ships to carry
weight of cargo, and the corresponding displacement when ships are loaded
down to a determinate load line ; and Table B, showing the mutual relations
of displacement, power, and speed, we may thus have the means of connect-

}14 REPORT 1857.

ing (that, is, within the limitations of the variations of build referred to in

Tables A and B), througli the intermediate element " displacement," the two

ATables and B thus establishing the mutual relations within the limits afore-

said, between builders' tonnage, gross register tonnage, and weight or cargo
tonnage, with the power required to attain a given speed, thus enabling us
to show the bearing of proportions of build as affecting mercantile steam
transport economy.

    In the first place, therefore, before entering on this exposition, and in con-
sideration that persons generally, even amongst those who devote their time
to popular and statistical studies, and to scientific pursuits, and even assume
the responsibilities of legislation on shipping, are not familiar with the technical
meaning of the terms "tonnage" and "burden," which are of such frequent
recurrence in discussing the properties of shipping, as compared with the
ordinary and unsophisticated meaning of those words, and are actually and
unconsciously misled by those terms, when used technically in shipping so-
phistry, having a signification quite at variance with their ordinary meaning,
I will endeavour to dispel this mystery by a few remarks in explanation of
the terms " tonnage " and " burden," which, above all other terms, are most
amenable to the foregoing singular imputation, namely, that their technical
meaning is directly at variance with the ordinary signification of the said
words : for example, ship's "tonnage" is not spelt with a u, " tunnage," and
we all know that a " ton," as distinguished from " tun," popularly signifies
2240 lbs. weight, or 20 cwt., each cwt. being 11 2 lbs. The ordinary accep-
tation of the word " ton " implies a unit of weight, not of measure. Thence
it is popularly inferred that the "tonnage" of a ship means the number of
tons weight which constitute the proper load of a ship ; but what is a ship's
tonnage as implied in the terms " tonnage O.M.," " tons burden," " register
tonnage" ? It has nothing whatever to do with weight. By the old law, termed
*' builders' measurement O.M.," which, though legally superseded in 1835, is
still practically in use, and constitutes to this day the rule which, even in
the Government service, generally regulates the builder's contract price of
shipping, the measurement of this tonnage is regulated by the length of the
ship and its breadth only, taking no cognizance of depth. It has nothing
whatever to do with the load-draught of water for which a ship may be
constructed. Provided that the length and breadth of two ships be the
same, the builders' tonnage O.M. will be the same, though the load-draught
of one ship be 30 feet and of the other only 3. This same tonnage, builders'
measure O.M., is also frequently called by the equally delusive term "burden,"
though, as above shown, it has nothing to do with burden : for example, in
shipping advertisements we see daily that " tons burden " is a designation by
which ships are conmionly advertised. It is true that Parliament abolished
that law of tonnage, builders' measurement O.M., or the so-called " burden,"
in 1835, but nevertheless the Government have continued to uphold the
rule (builders' measurement) as the base of their ship-building contracts, and
ships, as respects their comparative size, are still only known to the world
 generally by their so-called tonnage or tons burden, or builders' measure-

ment O.M. No steps having been taken by the Government to discontinue

 and forbid the use and adoption of the old law of measurement, though
 repudiated by statute in 1835, it has continued to prevail, and merchants,
following the example of the Government, make it the general base of build-
 ing contracts to the present day.

     It is therefore submitted for the consideration of the British Association,
 that the statute abolition of tonnage builders' measurement O.M., also called
 " burden," ought not to be permitted to lie dormant. It should be expressly
ON MERCANTILE STEAM TRANSPORT ECONOMY.                                                                      115

decreed that the said builders' measurement O.M. is not legally binding in

any contract, either for the building, or freighting, or chartering of ships, and
that the definition and measurement of " tonnage " shall be in accordance

with the existing law, viz. the Merchant Shipping Act of 1854, subject to
such amendments thereof and additions thereto as may be found necessary

to render the Act complete for all the purposes of shipping registration.

 --And now, what is tonnage registration under the new law the Merchant

Shipping Act of ISS^? To begin with: vessels constructed previously to

1854 are permitted, at the option of their owners, to retain their former ton-

nage or be measured under the new law, and be registered accordingly, and

the statistics or Parliamentary returns of shipping do not show to what extent

this privilege, of optionally withholding the former registration, has been

acted upon ; so that our present registration under the new law, the Act of
1854, is a mixed registration, and we do not know the ingredients thereof or
tlieir proportion ; but the measurement under the new law of all ships built

since May 1855, is an internal measurement, no notice whatever being taken

of external measurement, or of the light draught line or constructor's load

line, or any limitation thereof assigned by reference to " freeboard ; " and

consequently tonnage under the new law, the Act of 1854, does not give

the weight-carrying capability of ships, nor any comparison thereof, if of dif-

but if the law does not

bility of the ship, the question is what does it give ? It gives an admis-

sibly correct measurement of the internal capacity of ships, but calls this

capacity " tonnage," giving a new signification to the word ton ; for each

100 cubic feet of this internal space of the ship available for holding cargo

is called a ton of tonnage. Tonnage is therefore a mere measurement of

space, not of weight. Then, again, as regards cargo, even a ton of cargo is

not always rated as 20 cwts. The freight of goods is charged either by
measurement or by weight, and the same word " ton" is applied in all cases ;
100 cubic feet constitute a ton of shipping ; 40 cubic feet of some kinds of

goods, and 50 feet of others, constitute a ton of measurement goods ; and

cargo is rated accordingly for freight, provided the said measure do not

weigh a ton. 100 cubic feet of light goods may therefore be stowed in

1 ton of shipping, and be rated for freight at 2^ tons ; that is, a ship of

1000 tons register tonnage may be expected to stow 2500 tons of measure-

ment cargo, or, better still, 1000 tons weight of heavy goods, and fill up with

2000 tons measurement of light cargo, and thus go to sea with this 3000 tons

of freight, no limitation being assigned to draught. Such are the anomalies

of tonnage, and yet we talk of statistics based on tonnage ; and what is the

consequence of this abuse of the word " ton " ? Why, in times of war, our

tonnage registration of shipping not only affords no reliable data, but actually

deceives as to the capabilities of vessels for carrying ordnance and such

like heavy military stores. Experience of the past three years has abun-

dantly shown how great would be the advantage to the public if, in times of

war and emergency, when there is no time for the readmeasurement of

shipping, and when shipping must be chartered or purchased at any price,

our registration of shipping were available, like a tabular ready-reckoner, for

giving the Government a correct idea of the capability of every ship for

conveying weight of cargo, in addition to the present registration of capa-

city for holding cargo, and consequently a comprehensive view of the value

of ships for military transport service embracing both weight and roomage.

   The statistical insufficiency of the present system of shipping registration
as a record of the capability of ships, is shown by the following Table (A) :--

                                                                                    i2
ox MERCANTILE STEAM TRANSPORT ECONOMY.  11/

   In this Table it will be observed that the twelve vessels, A, B, C, &c-

to M, are all of the same builders' tonnage O.M., namely 1000 tons; that

we have three vessels (A, B, C) whose length is four times the breadth of

beam ; three vessels (D, E, F) whose length is six times the breadth ; three

vessels (G, H, I) whose length is eight times the breadth ; and three vessels

M)(K, L,  whose length is ten times the breadth ; and that, in each set of

three vessels, the load-draught of water is taken at two-thirds of the breadth,

half the breadth, and one-third of the breadth ; so that in this Table we have

a gradation of proportions, the length varj'ing from four times to ten times

the breadth, and the load-draught varying from two-thirds to one-third of

the breadth, which limits embrace nearly all the proportions of shipping in

mercantile use. The arbitrary elements of construction on which the calcu-

lations (Table A) have been prosecuted, are explained in the various head-

ings. It will be observed that the freeboard (column 5), or non-immersed

depth above the load-draught line, has in each case been taken at one-

fortieth of the length, plus one-twelfth of the breadth of beam. There is no

recognized rule for the determination of this element. Constructors of ship-

ping follow their own rules or their own caprice in determining freeboard, or
the position of the construction load-line. The above combined proportions

of length and breadth have been adopted, as giving a progression, which, it

is believed, will meet the ordinary allowance of freeboard at which loaded

ships of all sizes are sent to sea. The various elements of construction

(columns 7 to 16) are believed to be closely approximate to ordinary prac-

tice ; and the ratios of nominal tonnage to actual weight-carrying capabilitj',
shown in columns 1 7 to 20, are therefore approximately such as would result

from the ordinary build of shipping.

   Now, on comparing the ratios which result from the constructive propor-

--tions of the ships A, B, C, &c., M, we have the following results : 1st, it ap-

pears (see columns 17 to 20), that, taking builders' tonnage at 100, the ratio
of register tonnage varies from 85 to 51 in ships (A, B, C) of which the

length is four times the beam, and from 9i to 63 in ships (K, L, M) of which

the length is ten times the beam ; that is, taking the extreme cases embraced

Kwithin the limits of this Table, a ship of type will have a register tonnage

of 94 tons for every 100 tons builders' measure; but a ship of type C will

have only 51 tons register for each 100 tons builders' measure. It also ap-

pears (see columns 17 and 19), with reference to builders' tonnage O.M.,
taken at 100, that the capability for carrying weight fluctuates from 131 tons

weight down to 33 tons weight per 100 tons of builders' measure O.M., or a

Aship of 1000 tons builders' tonnage of the type will have four times the

weight-carrying capability that is afforded by a ship of 1000 tons builders'

tonnage of the type M.

With reference to register tonnage (gross), new measure, under the Act of

1854, taken at 100, it appears (see columns 21 and 23) that the capability

for carrying weight varies from 177 tons down to 52 tons per 100 tons of

register tonnage; or a ship of 1000 tons gross register tonnage of the type

A will have nearly 3\ times the weight-carrying capability that is afforded

by a ship of 1000 tons gross register tonnage of the type M.

With reference to weight tonnage, or the capability of ships to carry

weight, it appears (see columns 25, 26, 27) that, with the proportions of

ship A, each 100 tons of weight- carrying capability will require a vessel of

76 tons builders' measure O.M., or 65 tons gross register tonnage ; but

with the proportions of ship M, each 100 tons of weight-carrying capability

will require a vessel of 303 tons builders' measure O.M., or 191 tons gross

register tonaage.
--118 REPORT 1857.

With referencf! to tlie mutual relation of the load displacement and weight

tonnage, it appears (see columns 29 and 32) that with the proportions of

ship A, eacli 100 tons of load displacement will give 57 tons of weight

tonnage, but with the proportions of ship M, each 100 tons of load displace-

ment will give only 29 tons of weight tonnage ; that is, a ship of 1000 tons

load displacement, on the type of ship A, will carry double the weight that

would be carried by 1000 tons of displacement on the type of ship M.

It might possibly be objected that the foregoing variations, which have all

been calculated with reference to ships of 1000 tons builders' measure O.M.,are

not applicable to vessels of a different magnitude ; therefore, to test the validity

or otherwise of this remark, the same constructive elements have been applied

Xto a ship        of 20,939 tons builders' measure O.M., and 25,000 tons load

Xdisplacement, the length of this ship being six times the beam, and the

load-draught one-third of the beam, this type or proportion being the same

Xas that of ship F. On comparison of the ships and F (see columns 29,

30, 31 and 32), it will be found that the ratios of builders' tonnage, register

tonnage, weight tonnage, and load displacement, are closely similar through-

out: for example, in ship F, each 100 tons load displacement gives 42 tons

Xof weight tonnage, but in ship each 100 tons of load displacement gives

39 tons of weight tonnage. Hence we may infer that the results of these

calculations, showing the extent to which the weight-carrying capabilities of

ships is irrespective of the nominal tonnage, whether it be builders' tonnage

O.M., or gross register tonnage N.M., and is approximately dependent on

the constructor's proportions of build, admit of general application to vessels

of all sizes of the types referred to in Table A. Surely the above exposition

is sufficient to establish the necessity of some legislative enactment under

which builders' tonnage O.M., and register tonnage N.M., should not be

permitted to co-exist as recognized measurements of the mercantile capa-

bilities of shipping. Under existing circumstances, it is respectfully sub-

mitted for the consideration of the British Association, that a clause be in-

troduced into the Merchant Shipping Act, that the only legal signification

of the word "tonnage" shall be the measurement prescribed by the said Act,

and that no other signification of that term shall be legally binding in com-

mercial transactions. Also, that the capability of ships for carrying weight,

as measured with reference to some determinate freeboard, be made an item

of registration.

The ratios above set forth, as expressing the Aveight-carrying capability

of ships, include the whole weight available for engines, boilers, coal, con-

sumable stores, and cargo ; so that, as applied to steam-ships, these ratios, as
respects weight-tonnage for cargo chargeable for freight, assume a new phase

of great importance as affecting mercantile steam transport economy ; and,

for the purpose of inquiring into the modification thus introduced, the fol-

lowing Table B has been calculated, sliowing the mutual relations of dis-

placement, power, and speed, for vessels up to 25,000 tons load displacement,

the speed varying from 6 knots up to 25 knots per hour.

  The element " Load Displacement " being common to both Tables A

and B, we have, by the aid of these Tables combined, the means of showing

the mutual relations between builders' tonnage O.M., gross register tonnage

N.M., weight-tonnage, load displacement, speed, and power of all vessels

within the limits of the types or proportions of build referred to in Table A,

and thus showing to what an extent mercantile transport economy by steam

is affected by the proportions of length, breadth, and depth to which steam-

ships may be built. For example : let us compare a ship of the type D,

namely, length six times the beam, and load-draught two-thirds the bea.in,
120 REPORT 1837.

having weight-carrying capability or weight-tonnage of 2000 tons, with a ship
of the same capability for carrying weight, but of the type I, namely, length

Aeight times the beam, and load-draught one-third the beam. By Table

(columns 25, 26, 27 and 28), it appears that the ship of type D, of 2000
tons weight tonnage, will be 1680 tons builders' tonnage O.M., 1400 tons
gross register tonnage N.M., and 3680 tons load-displacement ; and by Table
B, it appears that 950 ind. h.p. would propel this ship at the speed of 10 knots
per hour; the consumption of coal at the rate of 3^ lbs. per indicated horse-
power per hour, would be SO cwts. per hour; and supposing the engines,
boilers, &c. to weigh one ton weight per fis'e ind. h.p., the weight of these
will be 184' tons; this ship may therefore be expected, on the data of the
said Tables, to make a passage of 3500 nautical miles in 350 hours, consu-
ming 525 tons of coal, and carrying 1291 tons weight of freight cargo. But
what would be the case with the vessel of 2000 tons weight tonnage of type
I? It appears that the builders' tonnage O.M, would be 5120 tons, the re-
gister tonnage N.M. 2720 tons, and the load-displacement 54-80 tons ; and by
 Table B, it appears that to propel this vessel at 10 knots per hour Avould
require 1240 ind. h.p., these engines weighing 248 tons, and the consump-
tion of coals 39 cwts. per hour ; so that, on the data of the said Tables, this
ship on the type I may be expected to make the passage of 3500 nautical
miles in 350 hours, consuming 682 tons of coal, but carrying only 1070 tons
of freight cargo. Hence it appears that with vessels of type D, we have ex-
penses proportional to 1400 tons register N.M., and 950 ind. h.p., with in-
come proportional to 1291 tons weight of freight ; while with the ship of type
I we have expense proportional to 2720 tons register N.M., and 1240 ind.
 h.p., with income proportional to only 1070 tons weight of freight; that is,
 the comparative prime cost expenses of transport in these two cases (assu-
 ming the cost incidental to one ind. h.p. to be equal to that of one ton of gross

 register tonnage) will be in the proportion of

+1400 -1- g.TO , ,,^ 2720 1240  = 3-70'
      = '-^^ ^«
1291             1070

 or in the proportion of 1 to 2. Such is the effect of mere difference of pro-
 portion or type of build on mercantile steam transport economy. This
 example of a difference or extra cost of 100 per cent, on the prime cost rates
 of freight per ton weight of cargo conveyed on the same passage, and at the
 same rate of speed, is evidently occasioned by the load-draught of water being
 two-thirds of the beam in one case, that of the vessel D, and only one-third
 of the beam in the other case, that of the vessel I ; and yet we see that the
 type or proportion of small load-draught in proportion to beam is a type or

 proportion of build, towards which the progressive increase in the size of
 shipping is gradually leafling mercantile practice, as exemplified in the most

 extraordinary maritime enterprise of the present day, the ' Great Eastern.'

    The mechanical advantage which attends progressive increase of size as
 measured by load dis])lacement, is conspicuously shown by Table B, whereby
 we observe tiiat a vessel of 250 tons displacement requires 274 ind. h.p. to
 attain the speed of 12 knots per hour, being very nearly in the ratio of one

 ton displacement to one h.p.; but, if the ship be 2000 tons, the ratio of dis-
 placement to power to attain the same speed (12 knots) will be 2 to 1 ; Avith
 a ship of 9000 tons it will be 3 to 1 ; and with a ship of 20,000 tons it will

I

 be 4 to 1. Hence a ship of the reputed size of the ' Great Eastern,* viz. about

 25,000 tons load displacement, Mill require proportionally only aborat one-
 fourth of the power to attain a given speed that would be required by a ship
 of 500 tons displacement. Hence the great advantage of size, provided the
ON THE VITALITY OF THE SPONGIADiE.  121

ship be of good type and can be always fully loaded; but seeing that load-
draught is limited by local circumstances and other considerations which may
not limit the length and breadth, it becomes a matter of calculation to deter-
mine at what point the admitted advantages of size become neutralized with
reference to any particular service by the limitation of loud-draught in pro-
portion to beam. Let us have all the advantages we can get, without running
into extremes, by which those advantages become sacrificed.

   Are not public interests involved in this matter, and is it not a matter of
grave importance, meriting the attention of the British Association ? I beg
to conclude with the suggestion, that it is only by statistics that the deficiencies
of our present maritime system can be properly searched into and brought
to light; and it is only by the force of statistical exposition that the re-

quired remedies can be devised. It is therefore respectfully submitted, that
the constructive type of shipping as respects the proportions of length, breadth,
and depth, constitutes a subject of inquiry which merits the notice of the
Statistical Section of the British Association.

                 Further Report on the Vitality of the Bpongiadcs.

                 By J. S. BowERBANK, LL.D., F.R.S. &^c.

                                                     [With a Plate.]

In the Report on the Vitality of the Spongiadae which I had the honour of
reading to the Association at Cheltenham last year, I detailed a series of ob-
servations on the inhalation through the pores and the exhalation of water
through the oscula of a marine British sponge, Hymeniacidon caruncula,
Bowerbank, MS., and I was enabled to determine with certainty the capa-
bility which that sponge possesses of opening and closing the oscula at its
pleasure; but I could not in that series of observations satisfactorily deter-
mine the nature and powers of the imbibing pores, as these organs can onh'
be seen distinctly in operation in very young and transparent specimens. I

therefore determined to confine my researches on this subject more especially
to Spongillajluviatilis, specimens of which may readily be obtained of small

size and under very favourable circumstances for the observation of the

porous system. On the 13th October, 1856, my friend Mr. H. Gilbertscn,
of Hertford, brought me several young specimens of this species, one of which

nad attached itself to a watch-glass, in which it had been kept for observation.
The point of attachment was a thin membrane projected from the edge of the
sponge {a, fig. 1, Plate I.), having in it a few single spicula irregularly dis-
posed, and with very little appearance of sarcode upon it ; and above the thin
attached membrane there was a second one, which was a prolongation of the
upper surface of the sponge. The body of the sponge was thin, concave at
the upper and convex at the lower free surface. It was nearly circular in
its outline, and rather exceeded half an inch in diameter. Atone portion of
the margin it had been recently extending its dimensions, and the space in-
tervening between the old surface and the new one had the appearance of
being one large cavity, the new dermal membrane being forced outward and
supported from the points of the radial lines of the spicula of the newly
produced portion of the skeleton, the outer surface of the membrane curving
inward, from point to point, in a manner that plainly indicated the forcible
--123 REPORT 1857.

pressure outward of the newly-formed radial lines of the skeleton. At a short

distance within the margin, and in the neighbourhood of the newly-produced
portion of the sponge {b, fig. 1), there was a single oscuium situated on a
large oval bladder-shaped projection of the dermal membrane, which varied
considerably in its form according as the sponge was inert or in action.

When in the former state it was frequently in a semi-collapsed condition,

the apex being considerably attenuated, so that the whole assumed an ovate
form, the smaller end being the distal one, and in that condition not the
slightest orifice was visible, the oscuium being entirely closed, and what was

very remarkable, its place was not even indicated by an apparent thickening

or corrugation of the membrane. On the contrary, when in action the blad-

der-shaped projection was dilated at the apex so as to cause it to assume a
regular oval form, and the oscuium was apparent in the form of a large cir-

cular orifice, about one-fourth the size of the diameter of the bladder-like

portion on which it was situated (fig. 2). From this orifice a powerful
stream of water was continuously ejected, and large and small patches of

faecal matter were frequently thrown out with considerable force.

   When a small portion of pure indigo was rubbed up in water, and a

drop or two of the water laden with this substance was mixed with that in
the watch-glass, and it was placed beneath the microscope with a power of
130 linear, and a strong light passed through it from a concave mirror,
at first no action was apparent, the oscuium was in a completely closed
condition, and although I searched the surface of the newly-formed portion
of the sponge with the greatest care and attention, I could not detect a single
open pore. In rather more than half an hour I found one open, and in a
short period others gradually and successively made their appearance, until
at last, in one of the spaces between two of the radial lines of the skeleton, I
readily counted as many as 10 in a fully expanded and active condition, and
in other similar spaces they were apparent in considerable numbers. The
action presented to the eye was exceedingly interesting. The molecules of
indigo approached the surface of the sponge at first slowly, their motion
beiu" gradually accelerated as they became nearer, until at last they sprung
as it were with avidity into the pores ; within the sponge some passed to the
right hand, while others took their course to the left, and they often passed
other molecules which had entered by other pores, and which were passing

in a contrary direction. Many of these molecules might be readily followed,

as they meandered through the interior of the sponge, and might be seen
flowing in every direction. During the maintenance of this action in full

force, when I directed my observations to the oscuium, it was seen pouring

forth a continuous stream of water and along with it masses of fiocculent
matter, and many of the larger molecules of the indigo that had entered by
the pores ; but it is remarkable that although the finer molecules of indigo
were being imbibed by the pores in very considerable numbers, very few
indeed of them were ejected from the oscuium ; and if the imbibition of the
molecules continue for half an hour or an hour, and then cease, the sponge
is seen to be very strongly tinted with the blue colour of the indigo, and it
remains so for at least 12 or 18 hours, after which period it resumes its ori-
ginal pellucid appearance, the whole of the imbibed molecules having under-
gone digestion in the sarcode lining, the interior of the sponge and the efi'ote
matter having been ejected through the oscuium. After having watched
the active operations of the sponge for nearly an hour, I set to work to sketch
the field of view in the microscope, in order to mark the position of the
pores ; but by the time the outline of the sketch was completed, about half

an hour, the action had ceased, the pores were entirely closed, and my further
ON THE VITALITY OP THE SPONGIADiB.  123

proceedings, as regarded their delineation, were deferred to a more favourable

opportunity.

   On the 14th the sponge was in a quiescent state, and strongly tinted by

--the indigo imbibed on the previous evening.
    15th October. I examined the Spongilla at ^ past 10 a.m.; there was ^lo
action to be detected, and a considerable tint of colour was still visible : at
9 P.M. 1 placed it under the microscope ; it was then free from colour and
in full action. The tube bearing the osculum was very different in form
from what it was on the evening of October the 13th, when at 11 p.m. it
was in form and proportions like an olive (fig. 2) ; at 9 p.m., on the 15th, it
was in form and proportions like the last two joints of a man's finger, slightly
bent at the last joint (fig. 3). At 10-30 of the same evening, when the
action had grown very languid, the basal portion was very much expanded,
and the whole assumed the form of a cone, the apical portion of which had
fallen over on one side, and the excurrent stream was directed towards the
body of the sponge at an angle of about 45 degrees to its plane (fig. 4) ; it
is evident, therefore, that this organ assumes a great variety of forms.

   At 9 P.M., when I commenced my observations, the portion under exa-

mination was crowded with pores in a fully expanded condition, and I imme-
diately mixed a drop of water charged with indigo, with that in the watch-
glass, and the imbibition of the molecules continued steadily until 10*30 p.m.,

when it suddenly became very languid ; at this period I directed my atten-

tion for a few moments to the osculum, and on again returning to the obser-
 vation of the pores, I found nearly the whole of them completely closed. I
 examined some of the largest of the pores with the utmost care for more than
 an hour with a power of 260 linear, but I could not detect cilia either at the

margins or within the entrance. When the incurrent action became rather

 languid, I observed that the molecules within the sponge were performing a
 sort of cyclose circulation, frequently rising up and passing across the open
 pores, but never coming out through them ; but while this action was going
 forward, now and then a molecule of indigo would pass languidly into the
 pore. It would seem, therefore, to indicate that the organs of incurrent
 action were situated, as I have long suspected, within the large intermarginal

 cavities, as in Granlia ciliata, and not immediately around or within the

 pores.

     During the continuance of vigorous incurrent action, the water charged

 with indigo is in continual motion, flowing from all quarters towards the

 open pores ; many of the molecules come in contact with the portions of the

 skeleton projected through the dermal membrane, and wherever they touch,

 tliey adhere tenaciously to the adhesive matter coating those parts, in the

 same manner as they do to the sarcodous membranes within the sponge ; but

 the same results do not seem to follow with those without, that occur with

 those within. On the evening of the 15th, when I terminated my observations,

 I left the sponge with an abundance of molecules attached to the internal

 tissues, and a considerable quantity of similar molecules fixed to the external

 fasciculi. On examining the same sponge at 11 a.m. on the 16th, I found

 the external tissues with the molecules still adhering in considerable quan-

 tities, but the internal ones were perfectly free from the coloured particles.

 The excurrent tube still retained much the same form that it had on the
 termination of my observations on the previous evening, but it was in a more

 collapsed condition, and instead of the osculum being a well-defined circular
 orifice, it had assumed a much smaller and more irregular shape, and was

 puffed out from the end of the excurrent tube in the form of a loose hemi-

 spherical appendage to its apex, from which a, molecule now and theu came
--124 REPORT 1857.

languidly forth (fig. 5). On examining the pores I could not find a single

one open.
   I again examined the same sponge at 8 p.m. of the 16th October. » The

excurrent tube bearing the osculum was nearly erect (fig. 6), and the stream
was slowly pouring forth. I examined the usual part for the pores, and found

very few that were in a slight degree opened. I then directed my attention

to the thin stratum by which the sponge was attached to the watch-glass.

Hitherto I had not detected any pores in that part of the sponge, but tiiis
evening I saw several which were open, and into which the floating mole-
cules were steadily entering. I selected one spot for observation, where
there were several pores indistinctly visible : in about 5 minutes they became

very much more distinct, fully expanded, and the margins assumed a thick-
ened and well-defined outline ; others made their appearance, and at last
fourteen were in a fully expanded and active state (fig. 8). I immediately

put a drop of water charged with indigo over the pores ; the molecules were
absoi'bed with great rapidity, and the rush of the indigo to the pores became
so great that its accumulation rendered the sight of them indistinct, and to

clear the sponge from the indigo I sent a puflP of air from my mouth on to

the surface of the water in the watch-glass, but doing this rather too roughly,
I turned the sponge over on its flexible base, as it were on a hinge ; I there-
fore removed it and placed it in a basin of fresh water to float it back again
into its proper position, and immediately replaced it under the microscope,
the whole operation not occupying more than a minute; but on getting the
precise spot into focus, I found not a single pore open : the sudden violence
done to the sponge had caused a complete cessation of action and a perfect
closing of the inhalent pores. This result is curious, in contrast with tho
fact, that the sponge endures a large Vibrio, which is continually crawling
with considerable activity over its surface, and frequently biting large mouth-
fuls out of the soft tissues, without appearing to create the slightest alarm,
although passing immediately across the pores while in full action.

  --18th October. At 11 p.m. I resumed my observations at the precise spot

which I had examined on the evening of the 16th, and of which I then took
a sketch. Not one of the pores that I had carefully diagrammed opened
during an hour and a half that I constantly observed them, but several others
close by the spot were fully expanded, and were steadily imbibing the mole-
cules of indigo with which I supplied them. I selected three of these for
observation, but with a power of 260 linear I could not detect cilia. The
mode of the entry of the molecules was regular and very remarkable : they
approached the pore by a steadily accelerated motion, and when they reached
the margin rushed suddenly into the orifice ; but although entering thus
forcibly, their course was not straight downwards, but eacii one seemed to
slip as it were round the margin and pass rapidly off' at an angle of 45 degrees
immediately beneath the dermal membrane, and their course might be traced
for a considerable distance in a straight line, and with a gradual decrease of
speed from the moment of their entrance. These circumstances would seem
to indicate the position of the motive power to be immediately within the
 margin of the pore, but I could not in any case detect them ; I sometimes
 saw a hazy rim immediately within the pore, but I believe this was due to

parallax arising from a slight change in the position of the dermal mem-
brane. The peculiar mode of the entry of the molecules, combined with the
 cyclose circulation that I have previously noted as occurring when the in-
halent action became languid, induces me to believe that the seat of the cilia

 is confined to the large intermarginal cavities of the sponge, and that they are
not appendages of either the pores or the oscula. At the end of an hour and

a half of close observation with the hope of detecting the act of the closing

of the pores, I was rewarded for my patience by seeing that the clear tense

rounded margin of one of them, which was black by the aberration of the rays
of light passing through it, began to lose its distinctness, and at the same
time it assumed an irregularly oval instead of a circular form. The margin
melted away, as it were spreading gradually inward towards the centre, and
this action continued until the orifice became entirely closed, and not the
slightest mark remained to indicate the place a minute previously occupied

by a fully expanded pore. When thus closed, the membrane presented pre-

cisely the same irregularly granulated appearance that characterized the sur-

rounding tissue. Two other pores in the immediate neighbourhood under-

--went precisely the same process in the course of less than a minute.
    October 19th. At 9 p.m. I found the sponge in very languid action, and
completely clear internally of molecules and indigo. The excurrent tube bear-
ing the osculum had assumed a new aspect. In addition to the usual conical
projection of membrane, the apex was dilated into the form of a supplementary,
obtusely oval bladder, terminated by the usual osculum in a fully dilated
condition (fig. 7). Through this orifice, in consequence of its favourable
position, I could focus clearly, down to the body of the sponge, and had
there been cilia lining the interior surface of the tube, I could not possibly,
I think, have missed seeing them ; but I failed in detecting the slightest in-
dication of their presence : very few pores were open, and none of those which
I had diagrammed carefully on the 16th, nor any of those which I had

observed on the 18th.
    I continued to observe this and several other small specimens of Spongilla

for several weeks, but as the results were with very little variation the same
as those I have previously described, it is unnecessary to detail them.

    The observations on Spongilla, as regards the forcible and the languid

exhalation, are in perfect accordance with my description of those actions in
the marine sponge Hymeniaddon caruncula, recorded in my report " On the

Vital Powers of the Spongiadae," published in the Reports of the British As-
sociation for 1856, p. 438. The vigorous imbibition and ejection of the
surrounding water is as strikingly indicative in the freshwater sponge as it
was in the marine one, of the period of feeding ; while the languid action in
either case distinctly marks the aerating process only, during which the
digestion of the nutritive particles previously imbibed is gradually effected,
and the effete matter partially ejected. In the performance of these instinct-
ive acts, Spongilla possesses the same degree of control over these actions

that I have described in my former report as existing in the marine sponge

sometimes the rapid ejection of the excurrent stream in the Spongilla was
suddenly brought to a conclusion, while at others there was a very gradual
decline in the rapidity of the action until it assumed the degree of force that

marks the excurrent streams of the breathing action only.
    The structure of the pores, and the perfectly plastic nature of the dermal

membrane, as exhibited in these observations, are very remarkable. The

sensitiveness of the sponge to injury, the rapidity of the act of closing those

organs, and the power they appear to possess of opening new ones to any
extent and in any direction they please, attest an astonishing amount of vital
energy in a membrane in which I have been unable to trace any indication

of the existence of fibrous tissue.

On Flax. By John P. Hodges, M.D., F.C.S., Professor of Agri-

   culture, Queen's College, Belfast, and Chemist to the Chemico-Agri-

   cultural Society of Ulster.

      Composition of the Unsteeped Flax Stem and of the Dressed Fibre.

For the purpose of studying the nature of the proximate compounds which

arc contained in the cells of the flax-plant, and which are in part removed in
tlie steeping process, several analyses, both of unsteeped and of dressed flax,
i.e. of the fibre in the condition in which it is brought into the market,
deprived of the portions unsuitable for spinning, have been made by the
Reporter. By operating upon large quantities of material, he was enabled to
separate considerable quantities of some of the most important constituents
of the plant, and had hoped to be ready to communicate the results of the
investigations in which, at various periods during the past three or four

years, he has been engaged ; but, froni the interruption of pressing profes-
sional duties, he has been obliged to remain content with merely a partial
survey of the subject. As, however, the chief labour of the investigation
has been removed, he expects that, in the course of next year, he may con-
clude the inqiiiry. In the mean time, a summary of some of the results ob-
tained will be found interesting, and in some degree useful, as a contribu-
tion to the chemical history of a material of so great importance to the sta))le
industry of Ireland. For the proximate analyses of the plant, various methods
of investigation were tried ; but that which was preferred, as affording the

--most reliable results, was conducted as follows: The flax, cut into small

pieces, was in the first place repeatedly treated with cold water, so long as
anything was dissolved. The solution was strained through linen, and after-
wards filtered and heated to ebullition. The coagulum which was produced
on boiling the liquid was separated by the filter, and a few drops of acetic
acid added, which produced a precipitate of caseine, which, after twelve
hours' subsidence, was collected, washed, dried, and weighed. In the liquid
from which the caseine was separated, when evaporated to an almost syrupy
consistence, alcohol, when added, produced a bulky gelatinous precipitate of
a greyish colour, which was collected on a filter, washed with alcohol, and
dried. The alcoholic liquids, on concentration, afforded rich orange-coloured
solutions, and afforded, on evaporation, reddish-brown extracts, which, in the
case of the dressed flax, weie found to contain a considerable amount of
grape-sugar. The several precipitates and residues, after being weighed,
were carefully incinerated, and the weight of ash obtained in each case de-
ducted. The amount of nitrogen contained in the samples was determined
by the method of Varrentrapp and Will, and in each case two estimations were

--made first, of the total amount of nitrogen contained in the specimen dried

at 212°; and secondly, of the amount of nitrogen which was retained, in the
form of insoluble azotized compounds, in the specimen from which all soluble
matters had been removed by treatment with water as described. The
amount of fatty matter and oil present was obtained by treating the specimen
dried at 212° in a simple, but exceedingly effective, extraction apparatus,
which for upwards of ten years has been in use in the laboratory of the Re-
porter, and has been found of great service in facilitating the treatment of
substances with alcohol and aether. It is formed by attaching a thin glass
flask, capable of containing about 6 oz. of liquid, by means of a small
glass tube and sound corks, to a glass vessel of about 12 oz. capacity pro-
vided with two openings, one being at the top and the other at the side, as
close as possible to the bottom of the vessel. To the opening at the top of
the vessel, a glass tube bent at right angles is affixed by means of a cork,
               ON FLAX.                                      127

and its longer limb made to pass to the bottom of a loosely-closed vial
which is placed in a beaiicr containing some cold water. The apparatus thus

constructed consists of three vessels; and the material to be extracted, reduced,

if possible, to coarse powder, or cut into small pieces and bruised, is placed

in the intermediate vessel, tlie lower tubulure of which should be loosely

filled with a piece of cotton which has been previously boiled with aether

Aand alcohol.  little flask, in which about an ounce of aether has been

placed, is then attached, and the bent tube inserted, with the long limb

passing into the vial, in which also there is some aether. The apparatus

being thus arranged, a spirit-lamp is held under the little flask, and the

heat continued until nearly all the aether is volatilized. The flask is then,

without being detached, cooled by immersion in a basin of cold water,

Avhen the asther in the intermediate vessel, and also that in the condenser,
is forced into it by atmospheric pressure. The flask is then dried by blotting-

paper, tiie heat of the lamp again applied, and the process continued until
the aether which passes through the little bent tube connected with the flask
is entirely (ree from colour. By this method of extraction, nearly all the
aether employed can be recovered by applying heat to the flask, so as to cause

the liquid to accumulate in the condenser, and a concentrated solution of the

matter dissolved is collected in the flask. By placing the flask (the weight
of which has been ascertained) in the water-bath, so as to remove all traces
of the solvent, the amount of the extract can readily be determined.

   The total amount of matters extracted by aether, in five experiments, with

samples of flax-straw, the produce of crops in this country, in different years,

and all of first-rate quality, gave an average of 2'068 per cent, on the flax
dried at 212°. The residue of the flax, after extraction with water, and the
subtraction of the amount of wax, &c. extracted by aether, and of the in-
soluble nitrogenized compoimds, as calculated from the amount of nitrogen in
the washed fibre, and assumed to possess the composition of albumen, and
of the insoluble inorganic matters which it was found to contain, was regarded

as fibre.

The following is a statement of the results obtained in the examination of

samples of dressed flax fibre, of average quality, and also of a sample of un-
steeped flax-straw which had been taken from the field when fully matured,

--and had remained for some weeks in the stack. The samples of fibre dried

at 212" contained, respectively No. 1, 9"10, and No. 2, 8'61 per cent, of
M'ater; and the unsteeped straw 12 per cent.:

   The total araoiint of inorganic matters present in the samples was ob-
tained by the careful incineration of tiie flax in platinum dishes. The
specimens of fibre dried at 212° gave, respectively, in No. 1, I'-tO per cent.,
and in No. 2, I'oi per cent, of ash. The ash had a brick-red colour. The
unsteeped flax left, on incineration, 5'23 per cent, of an almost white ash.

   By distilling the straw of the flax plant with water, there is obtained in
the receiver a slightly acid distillate, from which, when saturated with com-
mon salt, by treatment with tether, there is procured a small amount of an

exceedingly fragrant oil, of a yellow colour, which possesses an intense
honey-like odour. This oil, when heated, evolves a penetrating smell, with
a somewhat turpentine odour. It soon solidifies on exposure to the air,
forming irregular granules, and acquires an acid reaction. Its dilute solution
evolved the characteristic agreeable odour which is perceived in rooms in
which large quantities of dressed flax are stored. It may also be separated
by adding water to the solution, obtained by treating the straw with alcohol

in the extraction apparatus, and subjecting the mixture to distillation. By
the action of £Ether upon both the unsteeped and dressed flax, rich green-

coloured solutions are obtained. These solutions possess a strongly acid

reaction, and, on partial cooling, bulky, flocculent white deposits separate,

leaving the supernatant liquid of an emerald-green colour. The deposited
matter soon collects in transparent granules, and, when repeatedly washed
with cold aether, which separates from it a yellow colouring matter, it dries
over the water-bath to a slightly yellow brittle pulverulent extract, which
in the cold is scarcely at all acted upon by absolute alcohol, but dissolves
by the assistance of heat in spirits of turpentine and in ammonia, and is
saponified by heating with solution of caustic potash. Fixed on a loop
formed on a piece of platinum wire, and exposed, with the usual precautions,
to water heated over a lamp, it was observed, in several trials, to soften at
the temperature of 182° Fahr., and to melt at 184'°-5 Fahr. ; strongly heated
in a platinum capsule, it runs along the dish, then melts and evolves an
odour of wax, and when placed in its melted condition on paper, produces a
greasy stain. The amount of wax separated from the unsteeped flax amounted

to 0"27 per cent.

   When the solution obtained by treating the flax-straw with tether is evapo-

rated to dryness, a residue is left which consists of a deep olive, almost black
extract, mixed with a substance of a rich orange colour. This extract, on
being dissolved by the assistance of heat in aether, and distilled water added
to it, produces a brown turbid solution, on the surface of which a dark brown
sticky matter collects, which, when removed by filtration, leaves the liquid
of a bright golden-yellow colour, and affords, on evaporation, an orange
       ON FLAX.                                 129

 strongly acid extract, which was found to consist chiefly of a peculiar tannic
 acid, which strikes a deep green colour with the persalts of iron. This acid,
 which may provisionally be termed lino-tannic acid, was also obtained in white
 needle-shaped crystals, by adding neutral acetate of lead to the aethereal solu-
 tion of the plant, and decomposing the lead compound diffused in alcohol by
sulphuretted hydrogen. The filtrate from the sulphuret of lead, which had
 an orange colour, when evaporated to dryness, afforded on treatment with
aether, a solution from which, when the aether has spontaneously evaporated,
crystals of the acid separated. The acid, though existing in minute quantity
 in the plant, has been detected both in the unsteeped and dressed flax, and
 possesses considerable interest in connexion with the technical preparation
of the fibre, as its presence explains the discoloration which is frequently
observed when the flax-straw has been steeped in water containing salts of
iron. In addition to the lino-tannic acid, the straw of the flax plant was
found to contain a considerable amount of malic acid, and also an acid yellow
colouring substance of a resinous nature, which can be extracted by alcohol,
and yields, with basic acetate of lead, a rich chrome-yellow-coloured preci-
pitate, which, when suspended in alcohol and decomposed by sulphuretted
hydrogen, and the sulphuret of lead removed, yields a straw-coloured liquid,
from which, on evaporation, the resin is obtained in the form of a tenacious
orange-brown extract, which is insoluble in aether, but dissolves readily in
alcohol, and is precipitated from its solution in the form of a buflF-coloured
mass, which is dissolved by alkalies, with the production of a rich orange-

coloured solution.

   From the green plant, and also from the dressed fibre, water extracts a
gelatinous substance which is thrown down as a bulky precipitate on the
addition of alcohol. This precipitate was found to consist of pectine with
malate and sulphate of lime. In the unripe plant, and also in the stems, as
pulled from the field in the usual state of maturity, when the seeds contained
in the capsules have commenced to assume a brown colour, starch was dis-
covered, and could readily be extracted by placing the stems in a powerful
lever press, and moistening them with a small quantity of water. By allow-
ing the expressed liquids to remain at rest, the starch subsides, and can be
recognized by the microscope as consisting of extremely minute corpuscles,

which assume a purple colour on the addition of a watery solution of iodine.
When, however, the flax-straw is examined after it has remained exposed to
the air for several days in the stook, the liquid obtained by subjecting it to
pressure and washing with water was found to afford no indication of the
presence of starch. In the dressed flax, no starch could be detected, but
the presence of a considerable amount of grape-sugar was demonstrated.
The discovery of grape-sugar in the fibre is in many respects exceedingly
interesting, as it serves to afford an explanation of the statement frequently
made by experienced steepers, that, by storing up the steeped flax as imper-
fectly dried, by exposure to the air for some weeks before proceeding to re-
move the adherent woody matters by mechanical means (by scutching), the
separation of the fibre is found to be greatly facilitated, and its qualities
improved.

       Examination of the Steeping Process.

As stated in former communications to the Section, experiments, which

were conducted by immersing flax in water, both at ordinary temperatures,

and also in vats filled with water, heated and steadily maintained at from

80° to 90° Fahr., have shown that in both cases the series of decompositions

which ensued might be regarded as identical, and that the fermentation

1857.                                        K
--180 REPORT 1857.

which takes place resembles the so-called butyric acid fermentation. Thus,
when the gases which are evolved from the surface of the steeping vats are
collected, which is most conveniently effected by filling the receivers with
the flax water and supporting them over the surface of the liquid, the
mixture of gases obtained, when transferred to the mercurial trough, and

examined by the introduction of pellets of potash, explosion of the residue
with oxygen, &c., according to Bunsen's excellent methods, was found, in
numerous trials, to afford merely carbonic acid, hydrogen, and nitrogen. In
no case could traces of carbonic oxide, carburetted hydrogen, nor of sul-
phuretted hydrogen be detected. The absence of sulphuretted hydrogen
was carefully ascertained by the employment of various methods; not the
least indication of its presence could be detected, though papers moistened
with acetate of lead were exposed to the gases evolved during the entire
progress of the fermentation. This fact is important, as it has been asserted
that the disagreeable odour of the flax-pool depended upon the copious evo-
lution of sulphuretted hydrogen ; and its presence in the gases evolved has
been reported by a French chemist, though upon insufficient evidence,
afforded by the examination of flax-water, conveyed in bottles from remote
parts of the country to Paris. The production of a large amount of sul-
phuretted hydrogen has been urged as a serious objection to the adoption of

Schenck's hot-water process.

   The corrected composition of 100 volumes of the mixed gases evolved
from the fermenting vats was found to be as follows :

Carbonic acid       22-29
Hydrogeu            44-30
Nitrogen            33-41

                                                                                 10000

   At the Belfast meeting of the Association, it was stated by the Reporter
that, during the fermentation, a very considerable amount of butyric acid was
produced. Since that period, the experiments have been repeated on a con-
siderable scale, and it has been found that, though, when the fermentation
has fairly commenced, after the straw has been about twenty-four hours
immersed, the distillate from the fermenting liquid contains formic acid and
butyric acid; yet, as the process continues, and especially towards its con-
clusion, the formic acid almost entirely disappears, and the butyric acid de-
creases in amount, and is replaced by valerianic acid. In some cases, indeed,

the distillate, towards the conclusion of the period of steeping, afforded nearly

pure valerianic acid.

  Beport of the Committee on the Magnetic Survey of Great Britain.

                          By Maj 01-- General Sabine.

The author gave a brief review of the important researches connected with
the magnetism of the globe by MM. Kreil and Lamont, on the Continent of
Europe, Dr. Bache and others in America, and by our own observers in
various parts of the earth. He adverted to the Magnetic Survey of the British

Islands, executed at the request of the British Association in 1837 and 1838,
published in the ' Reports ' for 1838, as the first national work of this descrip-
tion which had been executed in any country, and to the similar works
since completed in Austria and Bavaria, at the expense of the Governments
of those countries, in proof of the value of the example. It is on such
   A CATAIiOGUK OF OBSERVATIONS OP LUMINOUS METEORS. 131

surveys that we must in great measure depend for the materials on which

correct delineations of the three magnetic elements on the surface of the
earth can be satisfactorily based ; and it is to the repetition of such surveys,
from time to time, th^ we must look for the data on which a true theory of

the secular variation of terrestrial magnetism may be founded. Twenty

years having elapsed since the execution of the iormer Magnetic Survey
of the British Islands, the General Committee had deemed that the proper
time had arrived for its repetition, and named a Committee for the purpose,

consisting of the same five members of their body by whom the former survey

was made, with the addition of Mr. Welsh, the Director of their Establishment
at Kew. The present Report stated the progress which the Committee had
already made, chiefly in England and in Scotland, and their expectation that
at the next meeting of the Association they should be able to report that the
work was drawing near to its completion.

Report on Observations of Luminous Meteors, 1856-57- -By the Rev.

  Baden Powell, M.A., F.R.S., F.R.A.S., F.G.S., Savilian Pro-

   fessor of Geometry in the University of Oxford.

In submitting to the British Association ray tenth Report of Observations
on Luminous Meteors, I could have hoped that it might have contained
some attempt at least towards the classification and generalization of the
vast mass of results which have now been communicated. But while the
actual contribution of fresh observations for the year which has elapsed since

my last communication is not very extensive, I am also constrained to admit

that I have as yet attempted very little towards the greater object in view.
   In the present communication, nevertheless, besides the mere detail of

observations, I am able to include notices of one or two important specula-
tions on the subject which have been pursued by some eminent men who
have turned their attention to this inquiry, and have followed out some

generalizations on certain points connected with it, which seem eminently
valuable towards the gradual establishment of a solid theory of meteoric
phaenomena.

   I. Some generalizations respecting the causes of meteor-phaenomena, espe-
cially the averages of their horary variation in numbers through the night,
have been advanced by Mr. G. C. Bompas, founded on the observations of

MM. Coulvier-Gravier and Boguslawski.

   The general result of those observations is, that the number of meteors
varies through the successive hours from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., by a regular
inc7-ease up to the last-named hour.

   The number which appear in the East is more than double the number
originating in the West; those from North and South nearly equal. In
other words, nearly two-thirds of the whole number originate in the Eastern
hemisphere of the sky.

   From the observations of Boguslawski and others, it appears that the crre-

raffe velocity/ of meteors is about double that of the earth in its orbit.
    Mr. Bompas, combining these facts, deduces the following theory, derived

solely from the conditions of the earth's motion. The greatest number of
meteors is encountered when the observer s meridian is in the direction of the
earth's motion, which is at 6 a.m. ; and then decreases to 6 p.m., when he
looks the opposite way. If the earth were at rest, meteors (supposed equally

                                                                       k2
--132 REPORT 1857.

distributed) would converge on it equally from all quarters. But the earth,
in fact, being in motion with a velocity half that of the average velocity of the
meteors, it encounters nearly two-thirds of the number on the side towards
which it is moving.

  AII. considerable series of results has been investigated by M. A. Poej',

respecting the colours of luminous meteors, derived from extensive sets of

observations collected by M. Ed. Biot from those made in China from the

--7th century b.c. to the 17th a.d. ; those collected in the Reports of the
--British Association ; and those made at Paris by INI. Coulvier-Gravier.

   Among these generalizations we may remark the following :

    In the Chinese observations meteors of simple primitive colours are very
rare, the great majority being of compound tints ; in the European observa-

 tions the reverse is the case.

    The Chinese observations show a remarkable constancy of tints during a
long period of years, when an equally constant but different scale of colour
 prevails ; and this for several successive periods.

     Cases of complementary colours in the body of the meteor and the train,

 or fragments, are often noticed,
     Changes of colour during the course of the meteor are observed, being

 most usually from ivhite near the zenith to blue near tlie horizon, but some-
 times from tchite to red. This, the author observes, agrees with the law of
 INI. Doppler, that a luminous body moving towards the observer will change
 its colour from white, in succession to the violet end of the spectrum ;
 ino\i\igfrom the observer, to the red. This law, he states, is especially con-

 firmed by the Paris observations. He remarks on the necessity for attend-

 ing to ^er^owa/ differences in observers' estimate of colour; a remark fully
 confirmed by the great contradictions existing in the descriptions of the
 colour of many of the brightest meteors, at the same time and place, by dif-

  ferent observers.

    He gives the results of the various observations cited, in tables exhibiting

 the number of meteors of each tint for each month; and adds others of
  meteors arranged under several heads, of physical peculiarities.

     The details are given in the Appendix No. 4.
     III. One point of the highest interest and importance towards forming
  any sound theory of meteors, is the estimate of their actual size from their

  apparent diameters and calculated distance. In all the results usually given

 this calculation is made on acknowledged geometrical principles, assuming
  that the apparent disk is the real one, diminished only by the effect of

  distance.

     Prof. J. Lawrence Smith of the U. S. has adduced some very remarkable
  optical experiments to show the entire fallacy of any conclusion from the
  apparent diameter of a highly luminous or incandescent body seen at a

   distance.

      These experiments exhibit a singular apparent enlargement of the visible
  disks of intensely luminous bodies of known size, when observed successively
  at distances of 100 yards, of a ^ mile, and -J- mile; at which distances re-
  spectively, for example, the body of electric light of carbon points (actually
  0-3 inch diameter) appeared i, 3 times, and 3^ times the diameter of the
  moon ; and other incandescent bodies in a similar proportion dependent on
   the degree of ignition.

      These results seem dependent on some optical or ocular cause, of greater
  energy than we can ascribe readily to simple irradication ; but in a rough way
  they admit of some degree of verification by looking at a row of street lamps
   seen nearly in a line from the eye, the apparent diameters of which do not

 decrease at all for a considerable distance ; and even then by no means in

 proportion to the law of perspective.
    This subject appears to be one eminently deserving of more full and

 precise investigation, whether in a meteorological or an optical point of

 view.

    IV. Prof. Lawrence Smith's paper is, however, mainly devoted to other
 points of not less importance respecting the nature and theory of meteors, and
especially of those which fall either wholly or in portions, producing meteoric

stones.

   He gives a minute account of five specimens found in America, accom-

panied by chemical analyses, from which it appears that they all contain the
mineral called Schreibersite, not known as a natural compound on the earth.

He enters largely on theoretical views, and in the course of these specula-

tions examines various hypotheses which have been put forth, and eventually
endeavours to revive the theory of the origin of these bodies from the lunar
volcanoes supposed at some remote period to have been in a state of activity.

    Without discussing such a question, which will perhaps be generally viewed
with suspicion at the present day, and passing to the general subject of
shooting stars, which the author is inclined to distinguish entirely from those
masses which have fallen to the earth, we may notice the apparently favour-
able mention he makes of the general admission of the cosmical nature of the
former, and of that view of their nature which regards them as nebulous

masses revolving in our system.

    It has been further supposed that such masses, being in a high state of
electric tension, on approaching the earth, a discharge might take place by
which their metallic elements might be reduced : dependent on the size of
the nebulous mass, the force of the discharge, the consequent intensity of
the fusion, and other conditions, larger or smaller metallic or earthy masses
might be precipitated, and might fall entire or shattered into fragments.
The author, however, considers these latter effects as incompatible with the
conditions of observed meteorites.

   But probably, on the whole, all such speculations are as yet premature.

We must obtain a larger amount of data and better classification of observa-

tions before we can hope to follow out such inferences successfully.
   For the details of Prof. L. Smith's paper see Appendix No. 5.
   V. In some of the earlier of this series of Reports, reference was made to

the theory proposed by Sir J. Lubbock, of meteors shining by reflected light
and being simply darkened by entering the earth's shadow, and to some ob-
servations of meteors which coincided with it. It is much to be regretted
that other observations of a kind capable of such application have not been
more frequent. One remarkable instance observed by Capt. Jacob, at
Bombay, was considered some years ago by Prof. C. P. Smyth, and a com-
munication on the subject made by him to the Royal Society of Edinburgh

--(184'9), of which a short notice in the Proceedings of that body is the only

remaining record the details having unfortunately not been preserved.

The results, however, are stated to accord exactly with the theory.
   The essential parts of the notice are given in Appendix No. 6.
   VI. Of the August meteors for the present year, the only notice which

has reached me has been an account published by Dr. T. Forster, of
Brussels, in the Times. He observed great numbers, some of them pre-

senting unusual appearances, especially in regard to colour.
   His letter is given in Appendix No. 7.

   No. 1. Details of a Meteorite mentioned in a former Report, which fell at
Cirencester in 1 835. Extract of a letter to Prof. Powell from Thos. C.

Brown, Esq.

       " Copy of a notice of the Meteorite entered in the Book of Donations of

-- Athe Permanent Library, Cirencester, by the late Mr. Arnold Merrick, Cura-

tor to the Museum. ' specimen of a meteorite which fell about half a
mile from Aldsworth in a field occupied by Mr. Waine, within twenty yards

       of his workmen, who were sitting against a wall at the time, on the 4th of
       AAugust 1835, a sunny afternoon without a cloud.
                                                                        meteor was seen at

       Cirencester proceeding eastward, and a remarkable noise was heard at half-

       past 4 in the afternoon. The noise was heard in most parts adjacent.

       " ' The workmen saw no unusual light, but heard the aerolite rush through

       the air, and felt it shake the ground by striking it with great violence. It
       fell on a swarth of oats, and drove the straws before it down into the earth

       for six inches, till opposed by rock. When the men got it up, it was not hot,

       but the part of the surface which appeared not to have been broken was

       quite black and soiled the fingers. It weighs about 9270 grains. It contains

       a great deal of iron, but is not magnetic. Its specific gravity is 3-4.

       " ·' Mr. Waine states that a shower of small pieces fell about half a mile

       south of the spot where this fell. Children thought it was a shower of

       black beetles, and held out their hands to catch them as they fell.'

       " My niece. Miss Anna Sophia Brown, now Mrs. Pooley, about 4 p.m. on

       the same day, being in her father's garden at Cirencester, perceived a meteor

       passing from W. to E., apparently about twice the height of Cirencester

       tower,''which is upwards of 100 feet high, looking like a copper ball larger

       than an orange [?], and having a tail or stream of light behind it. In its
       passage it made a rumbling noise heard by many persons, reminding her of

       thunder, and the people of the town marvelled that it should thunder in a

       serene day with a cloudless sky. On the same day at Aldsworth, 13 miles

       E. of Cirencester, the meteoric stone fell, the particulars of which are before

portion of its brilliancy and became nearly stationary. At first the appear-
ance was like a long oblique line of fire, '.vhich gradually swelled out towards
the centre, and curved itself not unlike a huge gilded serpent. Its apparent

                             " To the Editor of the Times.

--" Sir, Having just witnessed a very remarkable meteor, I hasten to send

you the particulars of it as observed from this place. At nine minutes to 5

(4'51 P.M., or, perhaps, 4'' 51"" 30^) a brilliant ball of white light fell from a
point in the S.S.W., 3° or 4° south and east of Jupiter. It grew brighter as

it fell, but did not appear to burst, and vanished about 12° from the horizon ;
its course was nearly perpendicular, but slightly inclined to the east. It left

behind it a brilliant streak of white liglit, tapering to both ends, about 6° in

length, which immediately assumed a curved or spiral form, exceedingly like

a serpent rearing itself up. The middle part of this tapering band of light

gradually expanded, taking the form of small fleckering clouds (cirro-cuinuli).

This became gradually more curved, or rather spiral, and the whole mass

drifted very slowly towards the south-east, the middle part having apparently

a more rapid motion than the extremities. It continued distinctly visible for
upwards of 10 minutes, when some heavy mist clouds drii'ting up from the

north-east obscured it. Being near the house, I got out an astronomical

telescope with a glass of low power, but was unable to decide whether the

ligh,t seen was vapour in the atmosphere (which it much resembled), or dif-

fused nebulous light.

" The sky at the time the meteor appeared was perfectly clear and briglit

with the rays of twilight. Its size was somewhat difficult to estimate, but I

should guess it at about four times the apparent diameter of Jupiter, which

was close at hand.

" Whatever wind there was came from E.N.E., but there were no clouds

in the tipper sky to indicate the direction of currents there. Not the slight-

est sound was perceptible. The point at which it first became visible was,

as nearly as possible, 20° above the horizon, ascertained by an altitude circle.

I had not time to get out an azimuth instrument to verify its position in

azimuth ; but the foregoing pai'ticulars may be useful for comparison, as it
has, doubtless, been observed in many places.

                             " To the Editor of the Times.

--" Sir, Nearly due south a meteor of a most remarkable and brilliant cha-

racter was observed this evening. The sky was clear overhead, but not

bright, and there arose from the horizon, to the height of about 10°, black

Aand jagged clouds.    falling star was said to have been first seen, and im-

mediately afterwards the writer had an uninterrupted view of the meteor,

which at first seemed to emerge from the dark clouds in a strictly vertical

direction, and stretched at least to a height of 30° from the horizon. In form

its first appearance was that of a wand, and it gradually tapered at the ends

and expanded in the middle, at which time its appearance was most brilliant,

its edges distinct and smooth ; and it was of such intense whiteness as to seem

an opake body, though bright as the new moon. As the expau.^ion at the

centre increased, the ends were bent in contrary directions, and Hogarth's

· line of beauty' was inscribed in the heavens on a gigantic scale.

aiid it had then the appearance of dislocated vertebrae. At this time the

--light was deep yellow, inclined to red, probably a reflection from the sun,

not far below the horizon. Its edges at last lost their character, its light

became pale, and very gradually it vanished altogether without the slightest

noise of any kind, which was attentively listened for. From its first being

noticed to its final disappearance, a period of about ten minutes elapsed. Ail

the changes seemed to be produced slowly, and only in its sudden appearance

had it at all the character of a gaseous explosion.

 --No. 3. A paper " On the Horary Variation of Meteors," by G. C.

Bompas, Esq., was communicated to the Royal Astronomical Societv, and
of which an abstract appears in their Notices for March 1857, p. 147.

   These researches relate to the law, and to the probable cause, of the liorary
variation in the number of meteors, established by the observations of
Coulvier-Gravier, Saigey, and others. (Recherches sur les Etoiles Filantes,

Paris, 1845, and Humboldt's Cosmos, iii. 440.)
   From these various researches the following table gives a summary of the

number of meteors at difi'erent hours of the night:

Hours p.M    6 to 7

           j
--144 REPORT 1857.

of the earth in its orbit, which he talces as a fair average. (6toiIes Filantes,
p. 102.)

    Mr. Bompas observes, that, as already seen, the observations indicate a
maximum of meteors at 6 A.yi., and a minimum at 6 p.m.; he also adverts
to the fact, that the part of the lieavens towards which the earth is moving
at any time is always 90° or 6'' from the direction of the sun. Thus at 6 a.m.
the observer's meridian is in the direction of the earth's motion, and at 6 p.m.
in the opposite. In other words, tiie law is this : that the greatest number of

meteors is encountered wiien the observer's meridian is in the direction of the

earth's 7notion, and the number diminishes thence regularly to 6 p.m., when
he looks the opposite way.

    Combining these considerations the author explains the facts on a very
simple principle, expressed by a construction of which the essential points are
here represented.

    m, nil, &c. being meteors eqtmlly distributed in space would converge to the

Cearth at if at rest, equally on all sides.
But if the earth move in the direction

-- EC with a velocity half\\\a.i of the

average velocity of the meteors, they will

converge to the earth at E half-way from

the extremity to the centre; and thus "»>
two-thirds nearly will fall on the side
towards C, or would have an apparent
motion more or less opposed to that of
the earth, and diverging from the point
towards which the earth is moving.

   The author gives this only as a general explanation of the principle. He

admits that the exact amount is more difficult to determine, and will chiefly
depend on the proper velocity of meteors, which seems at present not well
ascertained, and on their average direction, if ascertainable. It will also be
materially affected (as he points out) by the inclination of the earth's axis;
but these points remain for further investigation.

                                  (From the Coraptes Eendus, vols, xliii. and xHv.)

   The author observes, that, being much interested in the differences of
colour of luminous meteors, he has drawn up three tables, one of which
comprehends all the shooting stars and globes recorded as observed in China,
the second those observed in England (including some other countries), and
the third those at Paris. For tlie first table, he has made use of the well-
known catalogue by Edouard Biot * of the shooting stars and globes ob-
served in China during 2^ centuries, since the 7th century before Christ to
the middle of the 17th of our era. For the second table, he has had

recourse to catalogues published annually in England, from 184-1 to 1855,
by Prof. Baden Powell, in the Reports of the British Association for the
Advancement of Science. Lastly, for the third table, he has used the cata-

logue of shooting globes observed at Paris, from 1841 to 1853, by M. Coul-
vier-Gravier. Thus these three tables together comprise 2145 cases of
coloured shooting stars and globes observed in these several localities. With

respect to coloured shooting stars and globes, he has found nothing in the
catalogues of Messrs. Quetelet, Herrick, Chasles and Perry. In the three
tables is given the monthly distribution of the different colour of shooting

stars and globes. This notice appears to the author important, both as

regards atmospherical optics, and the relative dependences which may exist

between particular colours and the appearances or modifications of other
meteorological phienomena, as well as the variations of time according to
the seasons.

--observes one peculiarity as deserving of notice: viz. that the number and

constancy of the same tints in the observations of one period or dynasty
differ from those whether in the preceding or succeeding period. The same,
he says, holds good with respect to the colours observed when meteors
explode, whether breaking up into fragments or not.

    In making his inferences from the titles of observations in China as well
as of those in England and Paris, the author excludes those cases where the
body of the meteor and its train exhibit complementary tints, like some of
the double stars : this relation of tints he also finds in many cases of meteors
which break up mto fragments as compared with the original colour ; and in
meteors simultaneously accompanied by others, as well as in the coloured

light sometimes projected by them on the earth. He also observes that the

colour often changes in the course of a meteor through the atmosphere,

from tvhiie near the zenith to blue near the horizon. He also excludes from

his comparisons those meteors which have trains of the same colour witk the
body.

predominate, and that the compound blue-coloured meteors are twice as

numerous as those of a pure yellow and red colour ; a result contrary to that
Weobtained from the preceding observations in China.
                                                      observe that the

meteors comprised in the tints belonging to the lower part of the spectrum,

from green to red, are in number 465 cases, while those comprised in the

tints of the upper part of the spectrum, from green to violet, embrace 401

cases. Now, in applying to the colouring of shooting stars and globes the

theory of M. Charles Doppler on the colour of single fixed stars, of the

double stars, and stars periodically variable, it would be necessary to con-
clude from the facts, that 64 coloured meteors have been moving from the
observer, from the moment of their appearance ; supposing, which is not
always the case, that the meteors have followed the right line which joins
them with the eye of the observer. However, on the other hand, meteors of

a pure blue, which are of an ascending tint and approach towards the observer,
are twice as numerous as those of a pure red and yellow, which belong to
the descending tints and recede from the observer. According to the

theory of M. Doppler on the colour of fixed stars, an object luminous by

itself, or from a borrowed light, increases in intensity as it approaches the
observer, while the colour passes, rapidly ascending from white to green, then

to blue, and at last to violet. By receding, the intensity diminishes in all
cases, and the white light passes successively to yellow, to orange, and at last
to red. Perhaps we ought still to take account, in the colour of fixed and

shooting stars, of the differences of perception and appreciation of luminosity

and colour, of diff'erent observers.

1843, with notices of trains, fragments, &c., differently coloured, observed

   The author now proceeds to give a list of coloured shooting globes ob-
served at Paris fiom 1841 to 1853 by M. Coulvier-Gravier*. This skilful
observer has given with great precision as many as three or even four suc-
cessive shades assumed by meteors in their transit through the air. These
tints almost entirely follow the law deduced by M. Dopplerf, on the variation
of colour of a luminous point in motion. The greater part of the shooting

globes appear blue on approaching the horizon or the observer, after having
passed through all the tints corresponding to the upper part of the spectrum.

Some terminate with red, probably in receding from the observer. Besides
the law of M. Doppler, which may be applied to the colours of meteors, we

ought still to take account of the particular state of the atmosphere in a
twofold point of view, as regards electro-chemistry and the modificators of

meteorological agents.

their composition. It does not appear that any of them were seen to Tall, or
known to have been accompanied by any meteoric appearances, except in
one instance, in which a very vague tradition of this kind is mentioned.

He notices their irregular and fragmentary form and crystalline structure,

wiiicii he conceives evince the agency of intense heat, and show tiem to be

fragments of larger bodies.

   The presence of metallic iron in so large a proportion as that in which it

is found with respect to the other ingredients, he conceives to indicate a
proof of tlie absence of oxygen (in its gaseous state, or in that of water) in
the body from which the fragments are derived.

    The stony portions of the meteorites resemble exactly volcanic products;
in which the presence of iron also furnishes a point of analogj^ He also
comments on the usual presence of phosphorus, which is derived from the
nuneral Schreibersite, constantly occurring in these masses. The metallic
nickel, cobalt and phosphorus show equally the absence of oxygen. Carbon
is often found, contrary to the assertion of some observers.

    The Sclircibcrsite, which is observed as almost constantly present, the
 author remarks, is wholly ^jec?i//aj' to meteorites , no natural |)liosphuret of

 iron, nickel, or other metal being found as a terrestrial mineral.

    Hence he considers meteorites as having a common origin exterior to the

 earth, which he believes to be from the lunar volcanoes.

A large meteor observed at Wilton was estimated bj' Mr. E. C. Herrick

(Am. Journ. of Science, vol. xxxvii. p. ISO) to be about 150 feet in diameter.
It appeared to increase gradually in size until just before the explosion, when
it was at its largest apparent magnitude of i the moon's disk : exploded at

25° or 30° altitude with a heavy report, which was heard 30 seconds after

the explosion was seen. One or more of the observers saw fragments descend

to the ground. When it exploded it was three or four miles from the surface
of the earth ; immediately after the explosion it was no longer visible. The

large size of the body is inferred from the fact of its appearing A of the moon's

diameter about six miles' distance.

After the experiments above recorded, the uncertainty of suclj a con-

Aclusion is evident.  body in a state of incandescence might exhibit the

apparent diameter of the Wilton meteor at six miles' distance and not be

more than a few mches or afoot in actual size, according to the intensity of

the incandescence.

It ought to be added that Mr. Herrick (in the paper referred to) expressly

allows for some uncertainty of this kind.
   The author furtlier instances another large meteor observed at Weston,

and estimated by the same kind of calculation at a mile and a half in dia-

meter', on the principle of these experiments it need not have been more than

one or two feet.

 --No. 6. Extract of a Notice of a Shooting Star, by Prof. C. Piazzi Smyth.

From the Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, No. 34', Feb. 5,

1849.

   This instance, the rare one of an ascending shooting star, was furnished

by Captain W. S. Jacob, Bombay Engineers ; and he having given the place

where the body first appeared, that where it disappeared, and the time, with
great exactness, it was considered by the author to afford a good case for
testing the theory of Sir J. Lubbock.

   Allowing that many phsenomena of an atmospheric kind may have been

confounded with true shooting stars, still, the author observes, a great pro-
portion are undoubtedly of a cosmical nature, and belong properly to astro-

nomy ; and these may be divided into two classes of small bodies. 1st, Those
which are circulating round the sun as a primary ; and, 2ndly, Those which
are revolving round the earth as such. The first we may occasionally sec
when passing near them in their orbits, but are not likely to come within
sight of the same again, unless, indeed, they approach so near the earth as
to gravitate towards it instead of the sun, and so become satellites or shoot-

ing stars of the second class.
    Sir J. Lubbock's theory is, that the shooting stars shine by reflected light,

and are extinguished by entering the earth's shadow ; and he has given for-
mulse on this supposition for computing the distance of the body from tiie
spectator by noting the place in the sky where, and the time when, the ex-

tinction occurs.

   These formulai have been rendered more convenient for computation by
Mr. Archibald Smith, Phil. Mag., March ISIQ; and, computed according
to them. Captain Jacob's observation gives, for the distance of the body from
the observer, 1721 miles: and that entry into the earth's shadow was the
true cause of the disappearance, is borne out by the fact that the direction
of motion was toicards the axis of the earth's shadow. And, on account of
the extremely small distance of the body, its change of place during flight
would sufficiently account for its gradually appearing in the lower part of
the sky when coTuing out of conjunction, increasing in brilliancy during its

flight (reaching, at its maximum, the brightness of Venus), and then slowly-
vanishing as it entered first the penumbra and then the umbra of the earth's
sliadovv, in a slanting direction ; and lastly, the body can hardly fail of being
a satellite, as its distance is so much less than that of a shooting star, which
M. Petit of Toulouse has pretty well identified as revolving about the earth
in 3'' 20'", or at about 3000 miles from the surface.

                               " To the Editor of the Times.

 --" Sir, I venture once more to trespass on your valuable time and paper

to communicate the following extraordinary phsenomena to the public, since,
if similar meteors should have been seen in different latitudes, such registers

may tend to useful results, as well as to solve the long-disputed question of
the cause of meteors. Monday, being the 10th of August, astronomers were
all on the look-out for the periodical falling stars. I began my watch on the
9th, when some few brilliant examples occurred. On the 10th they were
more numerous, as also on the lltli ; but on the 12th, that is, last night, they

assumed very unusual forms and colours. Being at Ostend I returned late
to a good position above the sea, and watched them great part of the night.

Many hundreds fell in various directions, but particularly towards S.W. and
W., not N.W. as usual. They did not in general move fast and leave the

white trains behind them, as is usual, but descended slowly with a bi'ight
yellow flame ; others were splendidly crimson, and some bright blue and

purple. This fact is very curious, as favouring the hypothesis of ignited

gases, adopted by M. De Luc of Geneva ; and it would be interesting to

ascertain whether this coloration of the meteors has been observed in other

places far from the influence of the sea. I have ascertained that during the
whole of this month meteors have been numerous all along the Rhine and
in Germany. Such numbers have not fallen since the 10th of August, 1811,
nor have we any record of such a quantity as on the present occasion, extend-
ing over four days consecutively, and exhibiting such very brilliant and

diversified tints of light.

" Collaterally with these meteors the following phaenomena should be

noticed, proving the highly electric state of the air. In the storm which

raged in Holland on the 5th of July, the hailstones were larger than pigeons'

eggs, and broke nearly all the windows in Arnheim. The same occurred at
Spa on the 5th of August, when every pane of glass exposed to the hail was

beaten to pieces. All the electrical instruments indicate a high positive

Acharge.  tromhe or waterspout was witnessed by me in the distance on the

A11th. The showers have not cooled the air, as they usually do.       new

weathercock with several horizontal and vertical fans and wheels, which I

have put up in order to test the wind, shows that the varying gales have not

blown horizontally, but slanting, or in undulations, and the thermometer has

risen again to Indian heat. All these circumstances point to some cause of

the changes of temperature not at all depending on the place of the sun, and

which future observations may more fully develope, if astronomers will accu-

Werately observe them in various parts of the world.  may possibly derive

cations of the changes of weather.

On the Adaptation of Suspension Bridges to sustain the passage of
             Raihvay Trains. By C. Vignoles, CE., P.R.S.

The following observations are submitted to the British Association as ap-

pearing to possess sufficient interest for discussion, from tlie circumstance
of differences of opinion amongst civil engineers having thrown doubt upon
the feasibility of applying the principle of suspension to the purpose of

railway transit.

    But the practical success in America of this principle on a large scale
may be quoted as an example in its favour, and is a striking set-off against
the failure in this country, which occurred upwards of five-and-twenty years
ago, under circumstances which have militated against any attempt to
repeat the experiment. Some debate on this question took place in the
Institution of Civil Engineers of London, at a meeting last spring, from which
many engineers were absent ; and as the subject was on the intended appli-

cation of a suspension bridge to carry a railway across a navigable river

in the North of Ireland, a further inquiry may not be wholly uninteresting
at a meeting held in the Irish capital, where many engineers and other
practical and scientific men may be present, and who, not having had a pre-
vious opportunity of joining in the inquiry, may be disposed to propound

their opinions.

  A further reason for bringing the subject forward, and one which will

naturally create a more extended interest in the discussion, is, that the recent
events in India cannot fail to produce, among the remedial measures to be
applied, a general and a more rapid extension of railways, even to the most
remote parts of our Asiatic dominions, and in the course of this extension
many rivers of great breadth must be bridged.

    It is desirable to condense the matter into a few salient and important
points, and it may be generally assumed that the whole inquiry is comprised

under the following heads, viz

    1st. The maximum load to pass the bridge.
   2nd. The velocity of the train. And these being given, there are then

to be determined
    3rd. The strength of the chains.
    4th. The rigidity of the platform ; which having been duly provided for,

 the additional considerations will be as to

  --5th. Prevention of undulation, vibration, and oscillation.

   1st. Maximum load to pass the Bridge. This load may be taken as equal
to the weight of the locomotive engine and tender, and of as many carriages

 as will extend on a single line of railway along the platform of one wiiole
 opening between the suspension piers ; to the consideration of such a single

line the inquiry may be confined.
    The length of the train, and consequently the weight on the platform of

 the bridge, will therefore be in proportion to the span or opening. The
 weight of an engine and tender may be taken, speaking roundly, at one ton
 per lineal foot of the railway over which they pass, and the weight of loaded
 carriages at half a ton per lineal foot. For a bridge with a clear opening
 of iOO feet, the weight of a train extending the whole length of the platform
 would average little more than half a ton per lineal foot ; but as it has been
 generally customary to compute the insistent load on railway bridges at one

 ton per lineal foot of single line, this weight will be the one assumed.
     2nd. Velocity of the Train It would be opening too wide a field upon

 the present occasion to inquire into or to attempt to solve the complex
 ppoblem of what additional gravitating eflfect is produced upon railway
ON RAILWAY SUSPENSION BRIDGES.  155

Btrvictures by the percussive action of trains moving at different velocities.
It must be admitted, in limine, that we have not at present sufficient justi-
lication to recommend that railway trains should be allowed to pass over

the platforms of suspension bridges except at moderate speed ; nor, as a
matter of every- day practice, should the locomotive engine be allowed to act,

except slowly, while passing over such a bridge.
    With these limitations of speed, and of action of the driving-wheels, of the

locomotive, the resistance to weight which must be provided for in a railway

suspension bridge, need not be more than to meet the maximum load above

assumed, namely, one ton per lineal foot of the platform, in addition to the

weight of the platform itself, of the chains and their accessories, and of the
suspension-rods, all of which are matters of strict calculation dependent

--upon the span.
   3rd. Strength of the Chains. The mathematical theory of suspension
bridges has been so fully entered into by the best foreign and English
authors, more particularly by the French, amongst whom M. Navier is the

most distinguished, that little need be said now, except to give the best

admitted ybrwjwte for calculation. There is so little practical difference in
the form of the curve which the chain of a suspension bridge assumes when
freely suspended without a load, and when fully loaded, that is, the difference

in form between a catenary and a parabola, that the most esteemed writers

on this subject have, by common consent, agreed to consider the curve of

the chain of such a bridge to be a parabola rather then a catenary, on
account of the very much greater simplicity of the mathematical calculations.

Perhaps it may not be irrelevant to enter very briefly into this.
   When a heavy chain, freely suspended from two fixed points, is acted on

 by the force of gravity only, the foi'm of curve which it assumes is called

 the cateiiary. If, however, the chain be loaded with weights, distributed in
such a manner that for each unit of length {ex. gr. for each foot), measured

 along the horizontal tangent at the lowest point of the curve, the weights

 should be equal to each other, the effect of such a distribution is to cause

 the curve of the chain to approach in form to another curve called the

parabola. If the disti'ibuted weights become so great that the weight of
the chain may be neglected in comparison with them, the form which the
 curve assumes in this case is accurately that of the parabola.

     In most, if not all ordinary cases, the weight of the chain is, however,
 never inconsiderable in relation to that of the platform and of the testing-
 load together; and consequently the form of the chain is never exactly
 that of the parabola, though it approaches more nearly to this curve than to

the catenary ; so near, that for all practical purposes it may be considered

 to have attained that form, viz. of the parabola.
     In the case where the curve of the principal openings has a chord, say

 for instance of 424 feet, and a versed sine of 29^ feet, or the proportion
 between the chord and versed sine of between 14 and 15 to 1, the two
curves (catenary and parabola) passing through the points determined by
 these conditions approach so near to each other in form, that their greatest
distance, measured in a vertical line intersecting both of them, is only 0-6
 (3)5th) of an inch.

  --4th. The Rigidity of the Platform. This is perhaps the most important

point of the subject, and has probably hitherto been least considered, and,
strictly speaking, the novelty of the inquiry is confined to this alone. In
 all the earlier examples of suspension bridges, the object of the engineer
 appears to have been to construct the jilatform as light as possible. In
many instances this was carried to a most dangerous extent ; even in the
--156 REPORT 1857.

case of the great suspension bridge over the Menai Straits, tiie platform has
been repeatedly damaged by storms of wind, which twisted it as if made of
pasteboard. The late Mr. Rendel was the first engineer wlio perceived the

mistake which had been hitherto committed in this resjject. When the

suspension bridge at Montrose had been destroyed about twelve or fourteen
years ago, lie reconstructed the platform and stiffened it by bracings
so effectually that it has since remained uninjured. This principle of
strengthening the suspended platform was carried out to a greater extent by
the writer of these observations at the bridge over the Dnieper at Kieff, in
llussia, and the successful resistance of this well-braced platform to the
effect of hurricane winds, and to vibration, oscillation, and undulation, has

been very remarkable.
   The desideratum is, that the platform of a suspension bridge intended to

sustain a railway train should be made as stiff as possible; and the first
natural consideration is, how is this stiffness or rigidity to be best obtained ?
The mode in which this has been effected in the great Niagara sus]Densiou

--bridge, is on the system of a deep trellis frame, in fact, a timber tube, the

sides of which are of lattice-work, the railway passing on the top.
    It is generally understood, and a print published at the time seems to

confirm this, that the oiiginal iutention of Mr. Stephenson was to have
added suspension chains for supporting the tubular platform of the Britannia
Bridge, although that intention was subsequently abandoned, and the tubes
made sufficiently stiff not to require their assistance.

    Another great point in this discussion seems to relate to the adapting of
suspension bridges for passing railway trains in localities and under circum-
stances where fixed bridges could not be erected except at an unjustifiable
expense, or not at all, from the onerous conditions naturally or judicially

imposed.

   According to the locality, timber or iron may be best suited for con-
structing the jilatform, the platform being made as deep and as stiff as
possible, and thus becoming a girder held up by suspension chains ; and the
stiffness being augmented by the increased depth of framing, it will be
advisable that the rails should be attached thereto as high up as practicable.
But the weight of the platform must be kept within reasonable limits, to

avoid too great an increase in the sectional area and weight of the chains,
which would otherwise become necessary ; and further i)recautions have to
be taken as regards the distribution of the load on the platform, and to guard
against oscillation and undulation, for all which due consideration must be
given as to the proper breadth of the platform.

    The weight of the platform of an ordinary suspension bridge was formerly
scarcely more than 36 lbs. to the square foot of the area of the whole platform
the present weight of the Menai Bridge platform, after having been strength-
ened, is about 58^ lbs. to the square foot ; the weight of the platform of the
Montrose Bridge, as reconstructed by Mr. Rendel, is 41-^ lbs. to the square
foot; and the weight of the platform of the Kieff Bridge is 49i- lbs. to tlie
square foot, including the two footpaths which are corbelled out from the
 main part of the framing ; but the weight of that part of the platform
 between the chains, and which sustains the roadway, is about 60 lbs. to tiie
 square foot. The ordinary test-load for a suspension bridge was about
 62 lbs. to the square foot; the proof-load put upon the Kieff Bridge was
 really about 84 lbs, to the square foot.

    Now a railway-load passing over a suspension bridge being taken at one

 ton per foot forward, the weight per square foot upon the platform will
 vary as the breadth of the bridge : if the bridge be 20 feet, the passing load
ON RAILWAY SUSPENSION BRIDGES.  157

will be one cwt., or 112 lbs. to the square foot; if 27 feet wide, it will be
83 lbs. ; and if 30 feet wide, 75 lbs, to the square foot. The Kieff Bridge
is 52^ feet wide, and therefore a passing load of one ton per lineal foot
spread over this area, is only 43 lbs. per square foot, whereas the test-load
was 84 lbs. to the square foot, which is about double what would have been
the weight of the heaviest railway train ; or taking 42 feet, exclusive of
footpaths, the railway-load would have been 52 lbs. per square foot, or less
than two-thirds of tlie test-load, which, it may be remarked, lias remained
on forty-eight hours without the platform showing any deflection visible to
the eye, although some deflection really took place.

   It appears therefore most undoubted, that suspension bridges of modern
construction may be perfectly adapted to sustain the passage of railway
trains, and that the chief consideration has to be given to tiie character and
dimensions of the platform ; and as a general rule 1 would suggest, that not-
Avithstanding the advantage to be gained by depth, this should not be carried
too far, more especially if the lattice-girder system be adopted, as it presents
too much surface to the wind, and thus induces increased lateral oscillation.
Also, that the breadth of the platform for a single line should not be less
than 25 feet, in order to spread the load and reduce the insistent weight per
square foot of platform.

    It might be interesting to establish a comparison of the expense of various

descriptions of platform, but this wovxld lead too much into detail, and the

materials for this purpose have yet to be collected. Still, as a contribution,

and by way of illustration, the present opportunity may be taken to state

the cost of the platform of the Kieff Bridge, already mentioned as so re-
markably stiff, and capable of sustaining the transit of a railway train.

    In a length of 12 feet of the whole breadth of 52^ feet of the platform,
the quantity of materials was as follows :

Timber, 600 cubic feet  £150
Iron, 30 cwt                30

                                                              Total. ... £180

for a length of 12 feet, or £15 per lineal foot of the whole breadth of the
platform, which is something less than six shillings per square foot of a

--platform such as that at Kieff (of which the drawings were shown).
   5th. Prevention of Undulation, S^c. The effects upon a suspension bridge
of passing loads and of strong winds, cause vibration, oscillation, and un-
dulation. Of these, the undulation is considered to be the most serious.
The vibration may be assumed as produced by what may be called the per-
cussive action of the passing load, and when the platform is not sufficiently
stiff, and the passing action is irregular over the surface, as, for instance, by

the impetuous rush of a drove of cattle, or of a multitude of people, oscil-
lation and undulation ensue ; the first producing a lateral swing of the
platform, the latter arising from the bending of the platform in its longi-

tudinal direction.

   The remedy for vibration and oscillation is provided by a sufficiency of
stiffness, not to say absolute rigidity, in the platform, which will also, to a

certain extent, counteract the propagation of the undulation, but not entirely.

   The experience, however, of four years on the Kieff Bridge, has proved
that the mode adopted in that construction of disposing the suspension rods
alternately (in the manner shown on the exhibited drawings) has completely
counteracted the undulation ; and many very heavily-laden carriages together,

----artillery, cavalry, and large bodies of troops, have been continually
--158 REPORT 1857.

passed over the platform of this bridge without the slightest undulatory or
 oscillating motion having been produced.

   We are hence enabled to infer, without looking to improvements in detail,

which will naturally be introduced, that a platform so constructed and so
suspended as the one at Kieff', is capable of sustaining the passage of railway
trains at a moderate velocity, and within a reasonable cost of construction
and taking the example of the wire bridge in America, and of this wrought-
iron chain bridge in Russia, it may be legitimately concluded, that the
adajjting of suspension bridges to railway purposes is perfectly practicable.

    The extent to which tiiis application may be made can scarcely be defined
a priori, but the writer ventures, from his own experience, to state his
opinion, that where the span of the required bridge must exceed 300 feet,

the suspension principle should be adopted for the sake of economy.
    It would be extending these obsei-vations far beyond the bounds assigned

to such meetings as these, to go further into the details, and therefore, how-
ever tempting the opportunity, we must abstain from entering upon the
subject of the modern mode of obtaining foundations and forming river-
piers, which mode would greatly influence any selection between a fixed or
a suspension bridge. Neither must we even touch upon the choice between
the wire-rope and the wrought-iron plate chain, as the means of suspending
the platform, though it is obvious that where the span becomes very large,
the superior lightness of the wire is a great inducement to decide the pre-
ference for it over the wrought iron.

    The proportion between the chord and the vers^ed sine of the curve of the

suspending chain is another point of the highest interest, as i-elating to the
questions of more or less oscillation, and of increase or decrease in the

amount of tension, as this proportion varies.
    It is sufficient to have brought the general subject of the practicability of

adapting suspension bridges to sustain the passage of railway trains before
the Mechanical Section of the British Association ; and it is to be hoped

that this opportunity will not pass away without engineers and the other
scientific and practical men now assembled, bringing their judgement and
experience to an examination of this very important question.

On Electro-Chemistnj. By Professor W. A. Miller, M.D., F.R.S.

In reporting upon the recent progress of electro-chemical research, the
author stated that the inquiries made of late years in the field of electro-
chemistry were characterized rather by modifications of the laws previously
admitted, than by any fundamental additions to the existing stock of know-
ledge upon the subject.

   Faraday's observations on the exceptional conducting power of solid sul-
phide of silver, and one or two other substances wiien heated, had been
traced, by the researches of Beetz and Hittorf, to tiue electrolytic decompo-
sition, which is rendered possible by the somewhat viscous condition pro-
duced by heating these bodies. The true electrolytic nature of the decompo-
sition was proved, first by the rise in conducting power, occasioned by rise
of temperature (whereas in metals the effect is exactly the reverse) ; and
secondly by the effects of polarization observed upon the electrodes between
which such bodies are placed.

   Allusion was then made to the experiments by Bunsen on the insulation
      THERMOMETRICAL OBSERVATIONS AT POINT BARROW. 159

of metallic bodies by electricity ; in the course of which he had shown that
in many instances, as in the decomposition of a solution of sesquichloride of
chromium, the deposit upon the negative electrode could be made to assume
the metallic form by reducing the surface of this plate to dimensions consi-
derably smaller than those of the positive electrode, a result probably owing
in part to the secondary decomposition produced in the limited portion of
liquid around the wire, whereby the sesquichloride was reduced to the proto-
chloride of chromium and subsequently the metal itself was deposited. This
view was rendered probable by observing the effects obtained during the
electrolysis of sesquichloride of iron, in which these successive steps could be
distinctly observed. In cases in which, like the chloride of manganese, the
compound was already in the condition of protochloride, it was unimportant
whether or not the negative electrode presented a smaller area than the
positive electrode. Attention was called to the fact pointed out by Faraday
of the non-existence of more than one electrolyte in a multiple series ; thus
in the case of the two chlorides of tin, the fused protochloride is an electro-
lyte, but the bichloride, although a liquid at ordinary temperatures, is not an
electrolyte if anhydrous. Yet the bichloride when dissolved in Water, itself
also not an electrolyte, conducts freely; and a similar result is obtained in
other analogous cases.

    Referring to the decomposition of salts in solution, the bearings of elec-
trolysis upon Davy's binary theory of the composition of salts were briefly
alluded to, and some of the difficulties attending the adoption of this tlieory
in the case of the subsalts were mentioned; these facts, taken in conjunction
with those already alluded to in the case of the bichloride of tin, leading the
author rather to the view that a salt is to be regarded as a whole, susceptible

of decomposition in various modes (just as a crystal may admit of cleavage
in two or three different directions according to the method in which the

force is applied), and therefore admitting of representation under two or three
different rational formulae, each of which may, under particular circumstances,
be advantageously employed.

   in 1852-54. By John Simpson, Esq., R.N., F.R.C.S., F.R.G.S.,

                                                           [With a Plate.]

At p. 331 of the ninth volume of the 'Royal Geographical Society's Journal,'

 1839, Sir J. Richardson, in reference to Sir David Brewster's discussions of
an hourly register of the temperature at Leith Fort, says:

    " Convinced of the importance of investigating the phaenomena of diurnal
temperature in various latitudes, I have thought that a discussion of the
thermometrical observations made on Sir E. Parry's several voyages would
 be a service rendered to science." Following the lead thus indicated, it has

appeared to me that the results of the observations made at Point Barrow
would be a valuable though small addition to those given by Sir J. Richard-
son, to whose form of tables 1 have adhered, only making additions, as the
means of the decades or three divisions of each month, where I thought this

could be done without marring the original purpose of the table.

    Thn observations now offered were made with great accuracy, and possess

the advantage of having been registered every hour at one spot from the 3rd
 of September 1852 to the 7th of August 1853, and for a few days before
--160 REPORT 1857.

and after these dates in the neighbourhood, making a complete year, less 21
days. Again, in precisely the same locality, from the 7th of September 1853
to the 19th of July 1851', to which have been added the six first days of Sep-
tember, and one day, the 20th of July, during which the ship was in tVe im-
mediate neighbourhood, making a second complete year, less 42 days. The
ship returned again to the same spot on the 27th of August 1854, and
remained four whole days, for which the hourly register gave a mean tempe-

rature of 39°'448, serving as a fair guide in estimating the temperature of the
last eleven days of August, which accordingly has been assumed to be 39°'448,

thus reducing the interval in the last year to thirty-one days.

   To fill up the interval of twenty-one days' absence in 1853, the mean tem-

perature of these has been assumed at something between the decades last
preceding and first following that period. Thus, the first ten days of August
giving a mean of 3B°441, and the first ten of September giving a mean of
32°*146, the second and third decades of August have been assumed as 37°

and 35° respectively. In the same manner, to fill up the interval of thirty-one
days in the summer of 1854, the second decade of July giving a mean of
3S°"287, the mean of the last eleven days is assumed to be 39°. The last
eleven days of August having been calculated to give a mean of 39°"448, as
already stated, the intervening two decades can, without much risk of error,

be assumed at 40°.
   The thermometers used throughout the period of observation were made

by Adie and Co. of Edinburgh, in February 1848 ; and having been returned
to the Hydrographer's Office, Admiralty, in April 1855, I have no doubt
some of them could be obtained there, if required for comparison with any
acknowledged standard. There were six of them, numbered from 10 to
15, and remarkably alike in appearance and size. To each was attached a
graduated glass scale, on which, besides the number, was cut the maker's

name. On application at Messrs. Adie's establishment, Edinburgh, I ob-
tained the following information as to their mode of construction :

" For spirit thermometers constructed February 1 848,

   "Points fixed from standard mercury thermometer 62° and 32°. Scale then

   They were on several occasions exposed together to different degrees of
cold, and were very uniform in their indications down to the lowest tempera-
tures registered. Subjoined is a table of thermometers compared (p. 161).

    It appears from this Table that five of the instruments by Adie indicated
a mean of 35°"5 nearly as the freezing-point of mercury, whilst that by Cox
of Dcvonport stood at --41°, and that by Pastorelli at --48°.

  --Pastorelli, No. 419, had an error of 1°-5 at the freezing-point of water;

and at our lowest temperature its indications were 13° below Adie's.
    Cox's thermometer, No. 1, had an error of 2° at the freezing-point of water,

but at lower temperatures corresponded much more nearly with Adie's. Like
Pastorelli's, however, it had the disadvantage of a heavy box-wood scale, pre-

venting it from indicating rapid changes of temperature, which the glass scales
of Adie's instruments permitted. Both these were rejected for ordinary use.

   The mercurial thermometer used as a standard was Pastorelli, No. 406.
This also had a heavy box-wood scale, but I believe was otherwise a good in-

strument, and, if sufficiently long exposed to a uniform temperature, could

be trusted as low as 32° below the zero of Fahrenheit. At that point the

tube seemed to become irregular; and on solidifying, the mercury sank com-

pletely into the bulb.

  A curious circumstance happened with this instrument on one occasion.

Believing the quicksilver in it to be pure, I placed it beside one of Adie's, ex-

posed to the air at a temperature about the freezing-point of mercury, for the

purpose of ascertaining the exact degree indicated by Adie's at the moment
of solidifying. Whilst attentively watching it, to my surprise the column of

--mercury suddenly shot up the stem to 4°, then slowly but steadily de-

scended into the bulb. Though I heard no sound of the glass cracking, I
thought the bulb had given way, and the entrance of air had forced the mer-
cury up the tube; but in this I was mistaken, for having taken it on board
and thawed it, nothing wrong could be detected, and it worked as well as

before. The explanation which offered itself to my mind was, that the sur-

face of the mercury in the bulb becoming at once solidified, its contracting

pressed the central and still fluid portion of the metal into the stem with a

jerk, and thence again gradually absorbed it as the process of freezing ap-

proached the centre.

Whether these instruments by Adie were absolutely correct seems doubtful.

--In my Journal I find the following remarks regarding them :
   "Feb. 2, 1854'. Temperature fell to --39° in the night, when I had a good

comparison of the thermometers, those of Adie's remaining within a degree

--of 39°, whilst a quantity of quicksilver in a teacup partially froze. The

quicksilver remained out all night, and did not become completely fluid again

--until 9 a.m., when the temperature had been some hours at 36°, --35°, and

A--34-°.  mercurial thermometer placed in it also stood at --34°, and the

same one now blackened for exposure to the sun's rays and enclosed in a

--glass case has fallen to 52°, i. e. become solid, whilst the one (Adie, 11)
--in constant use shows only 37°*5."

 --"Feb. 3, 1854. One of the new thermometers was kept in the vessel in

--which the quicksilver was exposed; and it remained all day at 36°, whilst its
--fellows showed 39° and --40°. On removing it a small portion of the soli-

dified metal adhered to the bulb and still remains attached, although the tem-

perature indicated by it and the others is -37°. The result of this is either

that the mercury is impure, which I believe is not the case, or the instru-

ments have an error of 3 or 4 degrees."

  --" Feb. 4.^ The mercury adhering in the solid state to the bulb of the spirit

thermometer remained in the same state until half-past two this morning,

when it dropped off, that and the four other thermometers by Adie showing
-36°."

From these experiments, I incline to the belief that an error of 3 or 4

degrees will be found to exist in these instruments at the freezing-point of

mercury. The quantity of metal in the teacup was several ounces, and there-

fore too large, unless its indications be taken while partially solid either in
freezing or melting. I have considered the dropping off of the small portion
adhering to the bulb of the spirit thermometer as the best index.

  --The mercurial thermometer alluded to as descending to 52°, was one at-

tached to a scale apparently graduated regardless of accuracy ; but from some
experiments made with it, I considered the tube was tolerably uniform in

calibre ; I therefore removed the scale, and attached another reaching down

to within half an inch of its bulb. This scale was graduated by comparison

--with Pastorelli (mercurial), as low as 32°, and thence the graduation was

continued to the bottom of the scale in the same proportion, bringing it down to

-- 50°, about two degrees below which the mercury always stood when solid.

The spirit thermometer for use was placed in a tin cylinder 2^ inches in

 diameter, with a longitudinal opening through which it could be easily read
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

 this cylinder was kept in another of the same material which was painted
 white, seven inches in diameter, having a conical projecting roof, and a flat
 bottom, with numerous small openings in both, and a door opening like a
 common tin lantern : this again, with its door facing the north, was fixed to

 a stout stake, placed in the ice at a distance of 90 feet to the eastward of the
 ship. The arrangement so made was to protect the instrument from the wind
 and snow-drift, and from the influence of the sun, while admitting the easy
 access of air. To have placed it further from the ship would have been to
put it in the way of natives, who might steal or break it ; and as the ship's
 hull was banked round with snow, and the prevailing winds came in from
 the N.E., it was thought the effect of her presence on the thermometer at that
 distance would be little or none.

    The position of the ship at Point Barrow was at the extremity of a narrow
 point or spit of gravel, which at no part rose more than 6 feet above the
 ordinary sea-level, and about five miles distant from the mainland of the
 American continent. The coast trended on one side to the S.W., and on the
other to the E.S.E., and was uniformly low and flat in the latter direction for

 150 miles, whilst to the S.W.there was no elevation near the coast approaching

 100 feet for a like distance. Tlie mainland to the south had not been explored
for more than twenty or thirty miles, to which extent it was perfectly flat,
and the natives described it as quite level for several days' journey further,
beyond which it became hilly, and far south mountainous. The climate,
therefore, may be described as maritime or almost insular, and was not sub-

ject to such extremes of temperature as the land. This was ascertained by
the register kept by Capt. Maguire on a journey to the hunting-grounds

during the coldest part of the year, the temperatures recorded by him being
generally lower than those taken at the ship during his absence. In the
summer the shooting-parties recorded higher temperatures on the land than

were observed at the ship.

    The long polar night, or observed absence of the sun, was 69 days, from
November to January ; and the continued presence of the luminary in the
summer, owing to refraction, embraced a period of 74 days.

   The calculations for the following Tables were made at intervals of leisure,
and, though simple enough, were very tedious and open to error; but this, I

think, has been successfully avoided by the various cross checks I used.
Each mean in the first twelve Tables is deduced from the sums of the obser-

vations, and in no instance from results already obtained. Some exceptions
to this rule were made in producing the means of the two years combined.

   Table I. gives the mean temperature of each day, and the mean of every
10 days (or, when the month consists of 31 days, the last division is the meaij
of 11, and the latter portion of February is the mean of only 8 days) ; at the
foot of the table the mean of each month, and at the foot of the page the mean
temperature of the whole year, as ascertained from 8760 observations, those

of tiie last 21 daj-s of August having been intercalated as already stated.
    In this Table a remarkable rise of temperature will be observed before

and after the winter solstice. The month of December set in cold the first
10 days, giving a mean of 22i degrees below zero, whilst the second decade
presented a mean of only half a degree below that point ; and the last 1 1 days
rose to 6^ above it. The mean of December is little more than one-tenth of
a degree lower than that of October, and is nearly 4 degrees higher than
November : this was owing to a southerly gale which almost produced a thaw
for 3 days at the winter solstice, and had the effect of driving the ice com-
pletely off" the coast, leaving nothing visible from the beach to the furthest

                                                                           M2

range of vision, east, north and west, but the open ocean and a water sky.
This was succeeded bj' intense cold in January, when the sea speedily froze
over again.

   The periods at which the mean temperature of the year occurred in spring
and autumn were at the middle of October and April, or rather more than
20 days after the equinoxes; but the period of greatest cold was a month
after the winter solstice, and the greatest summer heat appears to have oc-
curred in the beginning of August, or 40 days after midsummer.

   Table II. gives the highest and lowest single temperatures of each month,

the means of the highest and lowest daily temperatures for each month, and
the means of these or of the daily extremes.

    This Table shows that the greatest monthly range of temperature occurred
in April, and was no less than 73 degrees, only 22 short of the range for the

--whole year, which was 95 ; running from +52° in summer to 43° in winter.

The mean of these two single temperatures was 3 degrees below the true
mean of the year, whilst the mean of the daily maxima and minima accorded
with the true means to nearly within half a degree.

   Table III. shows the mean temperature of every hour for each month.
By this, the hottest and coldest periods of the day may be seen, as well as
the mean daily range for the month. The coldest and hottest times of the

day were usually a little after 2 o'clock a.m., and a little before 2 o'clock
p.m. ; but the time at which the mean temperature of the month occurred
was rather before 7 a.m. and p.m. In this the daily changes of temperature
corresponded with the annual, in the intervals between the periods of the
extremes and the means following being sliorter than the intervals between
the periods of the extremes and the means preceding them. The greatest
range between the day and night temperatures took place in April, and was

11 degrees.

   Table IV. shows the mean temperature of every pair of opposite hours.
From this Table it does not appear at first sight that any pair of similar hours
can be selected as corresponding to the monthly mean ; but on closer exami-
nation, the pairs of 3 and 9 generally give a mean nearer that of the month
than any others. This appears more distinctly in the succeeding tables, where

the whole year is given.

   Table V. gives the hourly mean for the seasons, for the summer and

winter halves of the year, and for the whole 344 days, at the same locality.
From the omission of the 21 days in August, the summer temperatures ap-
pear somewhat below the truth, and the same remark applies to the summer
half and to the whole year. But this does not materially affect the main
object of the Table, which is to exhibit the progressive change of temperature
from hour to hour.

   Table VI. shows the mean temperature of every pair of similar hours for

the seasons, half-years, and year, as in the last Table. In the last column it
will be seen that the pairs of hours giving a mean nearest the mean of the
year are 3 and 9, or a little after ; or at very nearly equal periods before and
after noon and midnight, and not intermediate between the periods of the
extremes and evening and morning means.

    These first six Tables i-efer to the year 1852-53, beginning with Septem-
ber and ending with August ; and the six following are corresponding ones
for the year 1853-54.

   Table VII. differs from No. I. in the periods before referred to being
generally later, in the extremes being more marked, and in the mean tempe-
rature of the whole year being lower than that of the preceding one. Thus
the periods of the mean temperature in the autumn and spring were nearer

  the end of October and April, or about 24 to 30 days after the equinoxes
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

  the extreme of cold was experienced in the first part of February, and the
  extreme of summer heat was probably about the end of the first decade of
  August.

     The usual interruption to the winter cold was less decided, and took place
 at the beginning of the second decade of January, raising the mean of that
 month above December, as December in the preceding season had been
 raised above November.

    Table VIII. corresponds to Table II. By it the range between the

 highest and lowest single temperatures will be seen to be 1 degree more than
 the previous year, and give a mean 3 degrees below the true one of the year,
 whilst the means of the daily extremes accord very nearly with it. The
 greatest monthly range took place in March, and was 65 degrees : 1 1 less
 than that of April of the preceding year, and 31 less than the annual range.

    Table IX. is similar to Table III., from which it presents no very re-
 markable difference. In it April again shows the most marked range between
 the day and night extremes, amounting to more than 12|- degrees.

    Tables X., XI. and XII. agree in their general features with Nos. IV.,
 V. and VI., and are defective in the July and August columns from the

 absence of the ship.

    The succeeding Tables are compiled to give the means of two years, for
 which purpose the observations for the omitted summer intervals have been

 intercalated.

    Table XIII. gives the means of the decades or third parts of each month,

 and of the whole month. Also, the highest and lowest single temperature

 noted during the two years, the extreme thermometric range being 97 de-

+grees. The mean of these two extremes w"as 3°*5, and the true mean of the

two years was +6°"882, or 2,5 degrees below the freezing-point of water. The
 autumnal and vernal periods at which these temperatures occur, by tiiis Table,

are about 14 and 23 days after their respective equinoxes; but the extremes
of heat and cold, which occur on the 8th of August (probably) and on the
8th of February, are more than double that number, or about 48 days, after
the solstice. Here the interval between the summer extreme and the occur-
rence of the annual mean in autumn is 67 days, and from the latter to the
time of the winter extreme is 117 days; from the winter extreme to the
vernal period at which the annual mean occurs is 74 days, and from this to
the summer extreme 107 days.

   Table XIV. gives the mean temperature for two years, of every hour for

each month.

   Table XV. gives the mean of every pair of similar hours of Table XIV.
   Table XVI. gives the mean temperature for two years of every hour for

each of the four seasons, for the half-years, and for the year. In this Table
it will be observed that the interval of time between the extremes and that
at which the annual mean folloivinff takes place is perceptibly shorter than
between either extreme and the time of the mean preceding it.

   Table XVII. gives the mean of every pair of similar hours in Table XVI.
   Table XVIII. gives the mean temperature of every hour for the month of

June, for 22 days in July, and for the 21 days both before and after the 21st
of June, from hourly observations taken with a blackened thermometer ex-
posed to the sun's rays. This Table, though so limited, maj'^ be of some in-
terest in regard to the growth of vegetation during the short summer of the

Arctic regions.

   Table XIX. gives the means of the pairs of similar hours in the first and

third columns of Table XVIII.

                                Explanation of Plate II.

   Fig. 1 represents the mean daily curve for each month, as deduced from
Table XIV. From among the almost straight lines representing the winter
months, March is observed to rise in a bold curve, showing tiie rapidly in-
creasing power of the solar rays, which had hardly produced any effect in
shaded places during February. April exceeds March by 2 degrees in the
height of its curve; but that of each summer month in succession becomes
flatter in consequence of the summer warmth being attended by more cloudy
weather, and a lessened fall of temperature during the nights. September
presents a curve of great flatness, the difference of temperature between noon
and midnight scarcely exceeding 1 degree. The almost continued foggy state
of the weather then prevents the sun effecting much rise in the day, and the
great extent of sea, river, and lake surface, still unfrozen during the earlier
))art of the month, prevents any great fall of temperature during the night.
With the exception of a slight rise in the October curve, the whole six repre-
senting autumn and winter are remarkably flat.

    Fi(j. 2 shows the mean daily curves of the four seasons, deduced from
Table XVI. ; also the curve of the winter half of the year, or the autumn and
winter combined, the curve of the summer half, which is spring and summer
combined, and the curve of the whole year, each being the mean of two years.
The flat curve of autumn has nearly the same form as September, and in
position occupies the place of the mean temperature of the year. The winter
line nearly coincides both in form and position with January, and is very
flat. Spring has nearly the form of March and the position of April ; and
the summer cui've, either in shape or position, does not differ much from
July. With the exception of autumn, the curve of each season bears a
striking resemblance to that of its middle month.

    Fifi- 3 indicates the curve of mean daily temperature shown by a black-
ened thermometer exposed to the sun. The black line represents the month
of June, and the dotted one three weeks before and after the 21st of June. In
both, the extremes seem to be very near noon and midnight, and the bold

character of the curve is very striking.

On the Algebraic Couple ; and on the Equivalents of Indeterminate
   Exj)ressions. By Charles James Hargreave, LL.D., F.R.S.

In a paper entitled " Analytical Researches concerning Numbers," which
was published in the Philosophical Magazine some years ago (vol. xxxv.
p. 36), 1 had occasion to avail myself of a principle, which, though it has not
yet taken rank amongst recognized forms of mathematical reasoning, appears
to be capable of extensive application and calculated to lead to true and use-
ful results. This principle may be expressed by stating simply, that the ana-
lytical equivalent of an indeterminate expression is the arithmetical mean of
all its possible values. The accuracy of the results to which I was conducted

bytiie application of this principle in the pajjer above referred to, led me to
the conclusion, that the princijile might probably to some extent be intro-

 duced into mathematical science, without departing from or unduly extend-
ing doctrines heretofore admitted. Since that period, I have not had the
opportunity of pursuing this interesting subject ; but I find that it is one
                  ON THE ALGEBRAIC COUPLE. .                            185

which has not failed to attract the attention of eminent mathematicians ; and
I trust I may be permitted to avail myself of this Meeting of the British Asso-
ciation in Dublin, as a convenient opportunity for the publication of the

views which I had in contemplation on the occasion of my former paper.

These views having suggested themselves in the course of a brief investiga-
tion relating to the interpretation of the Algebraic Couple, I propose to in-
troduce this subject also, in the hope that it may prove interesting to tliose
Avho have given their attention to the various systems of Multiple Algebra

which have been from time to time propounded.

           On the Geometrical Interpretation of the Algebraic Couple.

   The object of this section is to apply and interpret the Algebraic Couple
to and by means of the geometry of angular magnitude and position.

  --The couple in its ordinary form, x-\-y^ \, is the argument of the arbi-
--trary function,/(a'+?/'V/ 1), which represents a value of u in the partial

differential equation

                                          cPu (Pu ,,

If we take the corresponding differential equation of three variables,

                  d^u d-u d?u_^

                  d^^df'^dF''

and effect its integration, not generally, but under the restrictive condition

                  +.r- »/-+ir-=7^(a constant),

we obtain

           ^v-l+?<=./,Aan-» J^ tnn-'    'j

whidli may be regarded as an integration of the equation upon the surface of
a sphere whose radius is r. If / be the longitude of a point computed from
anv origin, and X its distance in latitude from the equator, the integral

assumes the form

                  =2< 0[ Z+cos~'
                  -^\ cos Ay      . ),

or

                  M=^^/q:/i:ilogtan^).

whore ju is the co-latitude. The argument of this function is now in the
form of an ordinary algebraic couple, the constituents of which are an-
gular magnitudes ; and my object will be to show that the couple in this

form is an adequate symbolical representation of position on a sphere, or of
angular position in space, in the same manner as the ordinary couple ade-
quately represents position on a plane.

    It will be convenient for the sake of comparison to consit!or the algebraic
couple, when geometrically interpreted, rather as an operation, than as a

--quantity or result. Let us regard x-\-y*^ 1 not merely as denoting the

position of a point (x, y), but implying also the process of arriving at such a
point from the origin by progressing along an unvarying course, viz. that
course which is constantly inclined lo the unit-line at an angle whose tan-

gent is ^.
--186 REPORT 1857.

On a plane the direction of unvarying course is the straight line; and its

equation is

                          y=^x tan/3,

and the symbol denoting the point (a;, -y), involving its distance along the
unit-line, x, and the angle defining its course, /?, is

                ,(l+,/_ltan/3),or--'-L^.,/?^^.

Now if, on a sphere, we consider the equatof as the unit-line on which real

angles are measured, the line of unvarying course, or the line which is always
inclined to the unit-line at the same angle, is the rhumb line; and its equa-

tion is

                                  /tan 0=log cot ^,

where is the angle of direction. Introducing this value of 9 into the couple

-/^in its new form, /±    log cot ^. we obtain simply

                /(I  +--  s/'^\  tan  0),or  -^e^''~;
                 ^
                                        -"   cos

which is a couple of precisely the same form as the ordinary ])laue couple.

If we lay down the definitions that two lines of unvarying course (or

rhumb lines) are parallel when they are inclined at the same angle to the

equator, and that parallel lines are equal when they traverse the same amount

of longitude, we easily obtain the proper rules for adding and multiplying

two or more angular positions.

PTo find the sum of two positions or (/, 0) and P' or (/', 0'). From the

O OPorigin draw the unvarying courses        and OP' ;      from P draw the course

PP" equal and parallel to OP'; then P" is the resultant position. For the

algebraic sum,

+ + ± VHi/(I -v/ZTi tan 0) -I- Z' (1 v/:^ tan 0') equals /" (1  tan 0"),

if l-\-l'=l", and /" tan 0"=/ tan 0-f/' tan 0'.

Now in the construction above given, (which the reader will easily imagine

without diagram,) we have

                          l"z=l+V;

and since the equation of the line PP" is

                                 i\
             ^ --V tan 0'=lo°g cot c)
                                       lo°g  cot  tL,

                                                  cy

we also have

            = +/"tan0" /tan0 /'tau0'.

   Similarly, to find the difference of two positions P' and P" : fron) P" draw

the course P"P parallel to OP' and equal to it, but in the opposite direction
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

then P will be the difference of the two positions.

Considering the couple in the form                     e^"^-!, it will be seen that the

                                             cos

amplitude denotes, as on a plane, the direction of the position, or the angle

defining the course ; but the modulus does not denote the angular distance

traversed, or the length of the course, for that is         ; but it denotes the

                                                       sin

line into which the course would be projected if the sphere were opened out
            ON THE ALGEBRAIC COUPLE.                               187

after the fashion of Mercator's chart. The product of two positions (/, 6)

and {V d'), (that is, the fourth proportional to the unit.of angular magnitude

+and the two positions,) is evidently the position (Z",0"), where e"=0' 6, and

 --^' ^             ; that is to say, the amplitude of the product is the sum

cos 0" cos  cos 0'

of the amplitudes of the factors ; and the projection of the modulus of the

Weproduct is the product of the projections of the moduli of the factors.

thus see that as a plane angle bears a sort of logarithmic relation to linear mag-

nitude, so the dihedral angle (denoted here by 0) bears a similar logarithmic

relation to plane angular magnitude.
   It will be at once apparent that in this method of representing angular

position, every point has an infinite number of symbolical representations,
inasmuch as it may be reached from the origin by an infinite number of per-
fectly distinct courses. The longitude which we have denoted by I may be

denoted also by any value of /±2 « tt ; each value of which has a correspond-

ing and distinct value of d. In eiFect, the couple becomes

            l± 2mr ^Qn^--j

            cos 0,1

where 0,, is determined by the equation

            (l+2mr) tan 0,,=log cot ^.

    If the point be at the pole of the sphere, the values of 0,, are continuous ;
that is to say, every angle is a value of 0,, ; which is well known, for it is ob-

vious that the pole may be reached by an unvarying course at whatever angle
we start from the equator. In this case the longitude traversed is infinite

except when 0,,is -, in which case the longitude traversed assumes the form

OC-i-OC, and is any arbitrary quantity. This also is geometrically evident,
since if the pole be regarded as having a longitude, that longitude is per-

+ --fectly arbitrary. In this case the couple assumes the form /n
                                         \/ 1 tan
                                                          ^J.

it follows that if a position at the pole be deducted from any other position,
the resultant position is at the opposite pole; and since n tan-' (-V^-- 1)

On Infinite Angles, and on the Principle of BIcan Values,

   The exemplification of these subjects by the foregoing theory depends mainly
on the distinction above pointed out, between considering a position merely
as a point I'eached, and having one fixed relation witii the origin, and consi-
dering it with reference to tlie course by which it has been reached. The
former mode of consideration is merely a limiting view of the latter. If we
conceive a point on a sfihere starting from the origin of longitude and tra-
versing an unvarying course inclined to the meridian, and if we at any mo-
ment inquire, first, what amount of longitude has it traversed; and secondly,
in what longitude is it now posited, the answers to the two questions must
obviously be, in an algebraic sense, the same ; and in a geometrical sense also
they must be the same wherever they are intelligible, that is, for every po-
sition from the equator up to and exclusive of the pole. The assertion of
this geometrical proposition (the identity of the answers to the two queries),
extended by the substitution of inclusive for exclusive, does not involve any
principle other tlian the axiom, that, what is quantitatively true up to the
limit, is quantitatively true at the limit; for in this case the passage from ' up
to the limit' to 'at the limit,' may be considered in such a light as not of
necessity to involve any change in the character of the subjects or ideas with
which we are dealing, or to transfer our conceptions from calculable magni-
tude to something no longer the subject of calculation. The passage from
the equator of a sphere to the pole by an unvarying course does not of

necessity involve the consideration of infinite magnitude, for the linear space

-- --traversed in getting up to the pole is ; -, where a is infinitely small ; and
                                                            2 sni

the linear space traversed in actually attaining the pole is  2 sm y  , both of

which are finite and calculable. It is true that an infinite amount of angular

longitude is traversed, but this considei'ation does not interfere with the cer-

tainty of our actually attaining the pole in a finite time at a finite rate of

progress ; and there is nothing in the geometrical character of the problem         I

which could lead us to believe that the above inquiries are of totally difl^erent

natures when applied to the pole, and when applied to a point indefinitely

near to the pole. Let us then consider the point as having reached the pole

in this manner, and propose the two inquiries above suggested.

If we ask, what amount of longitude has been traversed ; the answer is, an

infinite amount. If we ask the geometrical question, in what longitude does

the point now exist; the answer is, that it is in every possible longitude

throughout the whole cycle of longitude.

  We are thus led by these considerations to the inference that the idea (as

applied to geometry) of an angle which in an analytical sense is infinite, and

the idea of an angle whicli has at one and the same time every real magnitude,

are one and the same idea. An angle in geometry, when made to vary by a

uniform process, is of necessity periodic in its magnitude ; but when the sym-

bol representing an angle is imported into algebra by the introduction of its

trigonometrical functions into general analysis, then the angle or its symbol

must of necessity be considered as having a progressive magnitude, and as

being capable of having every real value from negative infinity to positive

infinity ; and the foregoing considerations tend to the conclusion, that an in-

finite angle, in the latter sense, is the same thing as that angle in the former

sense, which has at the same time and in one conception every real value

an idea, the perception of which is facilitated by the circumstance that we

can geometrically depict a position whose angular distance in longitude from
         ON THE ALGEBRAIC COUPLE.                          189

a fixed origin has this singular value. If the conception of such an angle be
difficult, the difficulty exists to the analyst alone : to the geometrician the
idea is easy and even elementary ; for to assert that the pole has at once
every possible longitude, is merely to say that it is the intersection of all the
meridians, or that it exists at once on every meridian, which is in truth the
definition of the pole.

   The considerations here developed seem to derive additional weight from
a view of the subject which we have hitherto excluded ; where the point
passes to the pole directly in latitude, without any geometrical change of

longitude; that is, the case where 0=-. This is a limiting case. For all

values of 6 up to this value, the longitude traversed is infinite ; at this point
the infinity changes sign. What is the value through which it passes? The

analytical expression for the longitude, in all cases, is                       '

/=cot01ogcot^=cot-- log tan - at the pole.

This then assumes the form OC-rOC) where the elements producing the two
infinities are independent of each other ; a kind of expression wliich we know
to be the algebraic symbol for that which has every value within the whole
range of value. It is indeed generally said to be the representative of inde-
terminate value, or that it means, "any real quantity we please:" but the
language appears inadequate, the thing represented being manifestly, " every
real quantity at once." Here then we have a case in which, without passing
from the field of analj'sis, we find the conception of an angle having every
possible value at once ; and it presents itself to us as the limiting idea of a
series of infinities, and as the mode of transition from a series of positive in-
finities to exactly the same series of negative infinities.

   The series of infinite angles which represents the longitude traversed in

reaching the pole, is a series of functions of 0, of such a nature that their rate
of increase can be ascertained and their relative magnitudes compared, with

as much ease as if they were all finite quantities ; for they vary directly as

cotan Q.

   If (X.Q denote the longitude of the pole as reached at the angle Q, we have

^(OCe)_  logco'2_  Ztan0_ 2 OC9 ;
  d^
            siiTy  sin-0  sin 12

an equation which marks the rate of decrease as advances from towards

- : at that point it passes through the phase of analytical indeterminateness,

and then passes through the stages of negative infinity at the same rate of
progress as it had manifested on the positive side. The general result may
be thus recapitulated : that having in analysis met with angles of various de-
grees of infinite magnitude, they are interpreted geometrically into angles,
each of which has at the same time every possible value ; that having also in
analysis met with an angle which has an absolutely indeterminate value, or all
values at the same time, we find that it is the mode by which a series of de-

creasing positive infinite angles passes without discontinuity to an exactly

similar series of negative infinite angles.

   The series of infinite angles with which we are dealing is evidently at its
positive maximum when 0=0, and at its negative maximum when Q=ir.
At these points we pass through what would appear to be the most trans-
cendental of all infinite angles ; which resolves itself in geometry into the
190 REPORT-- 1857-

almost irrational idea, of the amount of longitude wliicli it would be neces-
sary to traverse before we reach the pole, the condition of the problem being
that we are never to quit the equator. It is useful, however, not to neglect
this transitional infinitj-^, for it is evidently of a different kind from those on
each side of it. It is the infinitely remote limit of a series of increasing in-
finities, just as the other transitional point appeared to be the nearest approach
to finite quantity that infinity admits of, the minimum point of a series of

decreasing infinities.
   Before proceeding to consider the trigonometrical functions of OC9, it will be

convenient to point out another series of infinite angles which presents itself
in the course of this investigation, and which may perhaps throw some light
on the nature of an infinite angle, though it is not so readily susceptible of
geometrical illustration as the case already considered. It has been observed
that any angular position furnishes an infinite number of values of f<,,, and
that the longitude has a corresponding number of values, connected by the

equation

                       +(/ 2«7r) tan 07»=log cotan ^.

By increasing n (which denotes the number of circuits which the course
makes round the sphere) without limit, 0,, diminishes without limit; and the

course approximates to an infinite number of circuits i-ound the equator.
The series of infinite longitudes now intended to be brought under considera-
tion, consists of the limits of the values of the longitude traversed when Q^ ap-

proaches 0, for all positions on the sphere from the equator to the pole.

When the point is at the pole, the infinite angle under consideration is that
which we have already noticed as being of a very high order of magnitude ;

its value is infinite, not merely because tan 0,, is zero, a circumstance which

for our present pyrpose is common to all other positions, but also because

logcotan ^ being log tan- is infinite. As the position descends from the

pole towards the equator, the limit of the longitude traversed assumes still an
infinite value, but diminishes in proportion to log cotan L, until the point

falls upon the equator itself, in which case the value is a transitional phase of
the series of infinite angles, and it assumes the form 0-f-O, where the two ele-

ments of which the zeros are the limits are independent of each other; from

which we are to infer, what is indeed geometrically evident, that the course
consists of an arbitrary number of complete revolutions 2w7r, in addition to
the original longitude of the point I. On the other side of the equator, the

longitude traversed passes through an exactly similar series of values, but

Wewithout any change of sign.  have thus another point of view from which

we perceive that the limiting conception of a series of infinite angles of vary-
ing magnitudes proves to be an angle possessing an infinite number of values.

   Having thus acquired some idea of the meaning of an infinite angle, by ob-

serving its demeanour through the various phases of the above geometrical
illustrations, the next question which suggests itself is, how are we to deal

with its trigonometrical functions. Confining ourselves to the set of angles

which we have denoted by OC^ (the longitude traversed in reaching the pole

at the angle Q), we may safely assert that these functions are independent of
0; for whatever may be the value of 0, all the values of OCg corresponding to

them are geometrically identical ; and we are here dealing with purely geo-

metrical functions. It follows that a trigonometrical function of an infinite
           ON THE ALGEBRAIC COUPLE.                                        191

angle is the same function of that angle which lius at once every possible

value, or which is the same thing, every possible value within one complete

Weperiod.  should therefore be inclined to say, that, speaking geometrically,

cos OC or sin OC has no particular individual value, but that it possesses at
-- Weonce every value between 1 and +1, both inclusive.
                                                         shall not, I ap-

prehend, arrive by any process of abstract reasoning at an analytical equiva-

Welent for these and similar expressions.  may, however, interpret them by

reference to particular problems, the solution of which involves principles not

purely algebraical; and the question will then arise, how far it is safe, having

regard to the nature of these principles, to consider the interpretation as uni-

versal.

   Suppose a point placed upon a sphere whose equator is horizontal, and such
point descending by the force of gravity, and that a person is entitled to re-
ceive, (or obliged to pay, as the case may be,) such a fraction of a pound as is
denoted by the cosine of the longitude of the place at which the point tra-
verses the plane of the equator. For every position of the point up to, but

exclusive of the pole, the value of this person's interest is simply the fraction

cos of a pound, d being the longitude of the original position. If the point
be actually on the pole, the problem considered as a physical one fails ; and
the answer assumes the form of a trigonometrical function of an angle which

has no one value in particular more than another. If we bring this limiting

--case within the scope of the problem by proposing it in this form : a material

point I'oUs from the pole of a sphere to the equator down a meridian, de-
termined by some impulse extraneous to the problem ; what is the value of
the interest of a person who is to receive, (or pay, if the result be negative,)

--the fraction of a pound above indicated ? the algebraical answer is the same

as before, viz. the cosine of an angle which has any or every value, no one in
particular more than another ; but the problem is not now purely algebraic,
but belongs to the Theory of Probabilities, which tells us that the answer is

+(cos w cos(2?2)-t-...-t-cos(mn))^OT, where n diminishes without limit and

m n=2 ii, that '\s, T^^ cos Odd; and this, which is the mean of all the possi-

ble values of cos 6, is therefore, in this problem at least, the interpretation of

the cosine of the indeterminate angle which denotes the longitude of the pole.

--Perhaps this doctrine of the interpretation of indeterminate values may be

stated as follows : If a problem when treated analytically give an indetermi-

nate result of which all the individual values are calculable, and if the same

pi'oblem when treated by the principles of the science to which it belongs

give a specific result, we are warranted in saying that the latter is quoad sub-

jectam materiam the interpretation of the former, and may be treated as its

analytical equivalent ; this doctrine being subject to the implied condition

that the science to which the problem belongs, and which gives us the spe-

cific result, is a science whose fundamental principles do not rest on induc-

tion in any other sense than the axioms of algebra do.

  A Aand B engage in a game in which they will win alternately, winning

first : what is the present value of A's ultimate winnings when they rise ?
--The only answer given by algebra is \

games about to be played ; but the real answer is evidently i, so that \ ought

and not the limit of any partial series, as 1, 3, 5, 7.... or 2, 4', 6, 8
192 REPORT--1857.

It would appear that problems of this sort are not soluble by algebra alone,
when the problem itself contains an indeterminate element ; but if it contain

an infinite in lieu of an indeterminate element, it is soluble by algebra, as a

limiting case of some more general problem. Suppose a person plays a

succession of games, of which, when divided into sets of three, he wins in
every first game a pounds, in every second b pounds, and loses iu every third

+game a h pounds; what is the present value (apart from any considerations

of time) of what he will gain, supposing that he plays until the happening of

some event unconnected with the game and which may never happen ? The

+answer given by the Theory of Probabilities \s^(2a b), being the mean .of

the three possible results of one set of games. If the conclusion of the play-

ing be indeterminate, algebra gives only an indeterminate result ; but if the

conclusion of the playing be indefinitely postponed, the answer to the problem

+ +is, the value to which the series ai' 6.r- c.r^+a.r^+&.r^+c.i'^+      (c being

-->(a-\-b)) approximates as x approximates to unity; and this also is

^ {2 a-\-b). The problem is in fact brought within the domain of algebra by
considering it as the limiting case of another problem, in which an algebraic

relation exists between the values of the winnings of each game ; and the value
of the limit depends upon the nature of the connexion. In the problem pro-
posed, the a pounds won in the first game has no kind of connexion with

the a pounds won in the 4th, 7th, &c. games ; but in the extended problem
a connexion exists, inasmuch as we consider that when ax\s the value of

a pounds at the end of the first game, ax*, ax'' ... represent the values of

a pounds at the end of the 4th, 7th, &c. games ; and it is this consideration
which renders the problem an algebraical one.

Considerations of this nature seem to tend to the conclusion, that we are

not to expect from algebra alone, as that science is at present constituted, the

discovery or proof of the principle that the analytical equivalent of an inde-

terminate expression is the arithmetical mean of all its values, or any prin-

ciple of this character ; for algebra being the science of symbols irrespective
of their meanings, knows nothing of symbols which are of their own nature

periodic or alternating, or otherwise limited as to the values they are capable

of having, or of symbols which are indeterminate in point of value ; except
indeed when they occur as limiting cases of particular problems ; in which

cases their values are to be learnt from the specialties of the problem, or in

other words, the science to which the data of the problem belong.

Returning to the consideration of infinite angles, it will be readily seen that

OCg and (X.,,_q are identical in every particular except sign. Considering

these angles as longitudes attained, they possess a species of identity which

OCg and OCg- do not possess ; the former pair have passed through precisely

the  same values, have traversed every meridian  the same number         of  times
                                                                                                      ;

the latter pair have not. Viewing the two pairs of infinities as angles im-

pressed with every value through which they have passed, now that they have

arrived at an indifferent or neutral value, the former pair possess an absolute

identity (except in sign) with reference to our mode of interpretation. If we

take two infinities which difl^er otherwise than in sign, and if we permit our-

--selves to say that (-- 1)'^=:0 and ( 1)°' =0, yet we could not thence infer

-- -- = --that ( 1)°'=(-- 1)°'' ; but since 1  1""'                  we  maybe  sure

-- --that ( 1)°'0=(-- l)«''-s since OCfl= OC^_o ; and if these quantities are to

tainly affirm, (the three infinities being the same,) that-  -- ---^ -^ fTzr""^-

This consideration enables us to obtain the following results, without the ap-
plication of the principle of mean values, wiiich, however, gives the same

results :

lieport on the Improvement of Telescope and Equatorial Mountings.

                   By Thomas Grubb, M.R.LA. ^c.

The labours of the Earl of Rosse, now only perhaps receiving due appre-

ciation, have placed beyond doubt the practicability of producing specula
for reflecting telescopes of dimensions equalling, if not exceeding, those
which the conditions of our atmosphere permit of being used with advan-
tage, combined with an accuracy of surface and consequent excellence of

definition which we can scarcely either hope or desire to surpass.

Meantime the achromatic objective has received but small increment of

dimension, and is now probably for ever distanced, in this respect, by its

competitor the reflector. The spirited exertions of the Messrs. Chance of

Birmingham have indeed produced a pair of discs suited to the formation of

an object-glass of abour. 29 inches diameter, but these exertions have not

been seconded by a corresponding spirit in Great Britain, either public or

Aprivate.       few years since, the possible acquisition of an achromatic tele-

scope, of corresponding gigantic size, was looked forward to as a national,

triumph, if ever accomplished; but our Government, retaining its character

of pr<)V(ubial supineness (if not apathy) in such matters, has allowed tliese

splendid  discs    to  be  transmitted  to a more congenial  kingdom yet even                           there
                                                                                                     ;

the work seems to progress but slowly, and 1 apprehend that their formation

into an object-glass is still a work for the future. Four years have now passed

since the production of these discs, and nearly three years since, on being

applied to by Messrs. Chance, I offered to form them into an object-glass.
Under such circumstances it is desirable that attention should be turned to
the reflecting form of telescopes as that alone suited for instruments of the
largest dimensions, and important that these should receive from time to

time such accessions of improvement as the progressive steps in arts or

science place at our disposal.

                                                                        o2
--196 REPORT 1857.

   Now the two points in which inferiority may be at present held as against

--the reflector are the greater liability of the surf\ices to tarnish, and the

less intrinsic brilliancy of the pencil. In respect of the first, I hold the

objection to be much less in amount, with good specula, than usually sup-
posed. If we have to infer that Sir J. Herschel frequently repolished his
mirrors at the Cape, we know that some specitnens of optical glass have
rapidly deteriorated. It was stated by Professor Moll, of Utrecht, at the
former Meeting of the British Association in Dublin, that there was then in
Paris an object-glass through which we might in vain attempt to look ; but
it is manifest that neither a low quality of speculum metal, nor glass carrying
its own destruction within its substance is fitted for optical instruments, and
that both should be equally avoided. As a proof of the permanence of good
specula metal, I may mention that on a recent occasion, a surface twelve
years polished showed an increase of only six per cent, of reflecting power
on being repolished.

    In respect of the second point of inferiority of the reflector, viz. the greater
absorption of the incident light, and consequent lesser intrinsic brightness of
its pencil, as compared with that of the achromatic. I would observe, m« limine,
that this difference decreases as the size of the object-glass increases, so that
an object-glass of 4 feet diameter, and of a thickness adequate to resist
flexure, would transmit little, if any, more light to the eye than a reflector of

equal aperture as it is now possible to construct it. Such considerations do
 not however lessen the importance of obtaining for the reflecting telescope
every possible accession as well to the permanence as to the reflective power
 of its surfaces, compatible with their general accuracy and perfection of
figure. To the improvement of the reflecting telescope in these respects, I
have lately devoted some attention ; how far 1 have realized what is valuable
remains to be shown.

    So far as the Cassegrain and Gregorian forms are concerned, these im-
 provements are based upon the employment of one or more silvered (not

quicksilvered) surfaces ; and my first application of it has been to that form

 of the reflecting instrument which I have long preferred (not perhaps without
 good reason) to all others, viz. the " Cassegrain." Convinced, from previous
 practical working of both speculum metal and glass, that both were capable
 of receiving equal degrees of accuracy of surface, I conceived it unnecessary
 to stop to consider whether the failure of a recorded attempt to construct a
 reflecting telescope of quicksilvered surfaces was due to the errors of work-
 manship of the artist, or the formula by which he was guided, and selected
 the small mirror of the Cassegrain telescope for experiment.

   Now the most obvious construction for a silvered mirror for such, was to

 form a lens (so to speak) of equal thickness throughout, having no disper-
 sion, and therefore requiring no correction of colour, and to silver the con-
 cave surface. This construction I rejected, notwithstanding its simplicity,
 on considering that there would be a secondary image (coinciding nearly
 with tiie primary) formed by the outer or unsilvered surface, and producing
 what is called a " ghost " in the field of view.

     I therefore assumed a radius of curvature for the outer surface differing
 considerably from that of the inner or silvered surface ; and as this would
 produce refraction and therewith colour, it became necessary to adopt an
 achromatized compound of crown and flint glass. This being constructed,
 has proved altogether satisfactory : the inner surfaces being cemented, no ap-
 preciable loss of light occurs from using two lenses instead of one ; the re-
 flecting surface being as yet only quicksilvered, no increase of light should
 be expected : still, when the combination is used in a telescope, the image
ON TELESCOPES AND EQUATORIAL MOUNTINGS.  19?

appears both brighter and whiter than when using the ordinary small spe-
culum; the image also appears perfectly free from chromatic dispersion.

When the quicksilver shall have been replaced by a surface of pure silver,

the increase of light will of course be equivalent to the proportionably higher
reflective power of the latter, which, in the absence of good photometric ob-

servations, may be estimated at the least at a fourth. The same principles I

propose to apply to the improvement of the Gregorian telescope, with in-

verted surfaces.

   In the case of the Newtonian reflector, and where the aperture does not
exceed 12 inches, the prism of total reflexion with plane surfaces, as at pre-
sent occasionally used, seems hardly to admit of improvement ; but for much
larger apertures, and especially when we approach the size of Lord Rosse's
great telescope, where the requisite size of the prism would involve the pass-
ing of the rays through about 6 inches of glass, the case is widely different,
and if the difficulty, not to speak of the expense, of procuring prisms of
homogeneous and perfectly annealed glass of adequate dimensions did
not prevent their use, their thickness would go far to neutralize their use-

fulness.

   The arrangement which here first presented itself, as affording some spe-
cial advantages and permitting of a great reduction in the size of the reflect-
ing prism, was to construct the prism with a converging power, and place it
beyond the focus of the large speculum, so that the reflected pencil would
form a secondary image to be viewed by the eye-glass instead of the primary.
By adopting an aplanatic construction for the prism, the distinctness would
be preserved, and the entire arrangement better (as having fewer surfaces)
than the more obvious one of a small plane prism placed a short distance
within the focus, and reaching (so to speak) this image with a long com-
pound eyepiece of four lenses. Both constructions, however, include two
obvious disadvantages ; viz. a secondary image, illuminating the surfaces and
making the field less dark than otherwise ; and secondly, and which is of
more consequence, a very reduced field of view.

    That form of the reflecting prism which I propose for adoption in the case

--of large Newtonian reflectors, is as follows : the prism is an aplanatic com-

pound o^ negative or diverging power ; this power is of course arbitrary or ad

libitum, but I prefer that it be such as will about halve the angle of con-
vergence of the pencil passing through it from the large speculum. As-
suming this proportion to be adopted, the practical effect will be as follows:
the requisite size of the prism will be just halved (linearly), the resulting
image will be doubled in linear dimensions, and the magnifying power (with

any given eyepiece) augmented in the same proportion. The length of the
telescope will indeed be increased, but only by one-fourth of a diameter of
the large speculum. This arrangement has the obvious advantages of the
fewest possible surfaces, and no secondary image. It has been objected that
the field of view is by it lessened. I cannot consider such to be the case in a
practical sense ; for even with Lord Rosse's telescope of 54? feet focus, the
lowest eyepiece in general use may be doubled in all its proportions, and with
such lower-power eyepiece and the proposed prism, the magnifying power and
angular extent of field would correspond with these same as obtainable from
the combination of the higher eyepiece and ordinary plane mirror or plane

 prism.

    It will be observed that my proposed improvements, so far as described,

 relate only to substitutes for the small mirror of reflecting telescopes ; and
 for so far I consider they may be confidently and advantageously applied. I
 see, however, no reason why the same may not be applied to the large specula
--198 REPORT 1857-

of the smaller reflecting instruments, and, assuming that cither the Cassegrain

or Gregorian form is selected, a beautiful principle of correction is indicated,
viz. : let both large and small mirrors be made each of a single piece of glass,
let the outer surface of the larger lens (that which when silvered becomes
the larger speculum of the telescope) differ in its radius of curvature from

that of the silvered surface by the least quantity which will sufficiently dis-

sipate its reflected image in the field, and let the outer surface of the smaller
lens (that which when silvered becomes the small speculum) diff'er from the sil-
vered surface of the same in an opposite manner, i.e.(allowing for the distance
between the two lenses) so that the colour produced by the refraction of the

larger lens shall be balanced by the colour of an opposing refraction in the

smaller. This done, the combination as a whole will be achromatized, and
the secondary images (or " ghosts ") so far dilated as to be insensible in the

field.

   For the great speculum of instruments of the largest class we probably
must retain the speculum metal ; there is, however, a construction which is
possibly practical up to a considerable size, viz. that of a comparatively thin
lens, silvered at the back, and supported throughout its back (or nearly so) by
a thick or ribbed disc or casting of glass or metal, ground to fit with ade-

quate accuracy.

   It may be useful, in concluding this section of the subject, to make a rough

Acomparison of the achromatic and reflector. 15-inch reflector, in which the

suggested improvements were carried out so far only as the small metal is
concerned, would equal a 12-inch achromatic in light, and a reflector of 36
inches in diameter, similarly circumstanced, would be more than equivalent

to an achromatic of the size of the 29-inch discs already spoken of, while,
the length of the telescope being in each instance, for the achromatic, more
than double that of the reflector, the expense of the mounting may be

estimated as fourfold.

In passing to the second division of my subject, viz. the improvement of

the equatorial mounting of large telescopes, I would first briefly advert to

the several constructions in use, and which may be classed under three

Wevarieties, two of which are of English, the third of German origin.  have,

then, the long-polar axis variety, which has the great disadvantage of the un-

steadiness resulting from the telescope being attached to nearly tlie toeakest
part of an axis longer than itself. Secondly, we have the overhanging con-
struction, consisting of a cone of great comparative w-eight and dimensions,
and prolonged beyond its upper bearing in a biforked manner, thereby ad-
mitting of the telescope turning on bearings within the projecting fork. This
construction requires for steadiness an unwieldy mass of moving matter in
proportion to the optical power it supports, four tons being used in the case
of a telescope of 8 inches aperture, a mass tenfold that required with a

better construction.

   The third variety, or German form of equatorial, has the advantage of the

telescope being supported as close as possible to the strongest part of its

polar axis ; and the efficiency of such mounting is placed beyond doubt by

the well known Dorpat instrument, and subsequently by the Avorking of

still larger instruments, for example, that erected many years since in this

13^country for E. J. Cooper, Esq., where the telescope is  inches aperture

and 24|^ feet focus, and which has remained in effective use, with scarcely any

--repair, from the time of its erection, although unprovided with a dome or

other roof, a point of no slight importance when we consider the expense of

such for so large an instrument, not to speak of the labour and time con-

sumed in moving it during observation.
ON TELESCOPES AND EQUATORIAL MOUNTINGS.  199

    It will be seen, from this short mention of the several varieties of equato-
 rial mountings, that I give a most decided preference to the general form or
principles of construction of the German instrument, in which preference it
 cannot be supposed that there is any undue element of partiality, as none of

the forms are of my own devising. The British Association, it will be re-

 collected, long since impressed with the importance to science of having a
 powerful instruuient sent to a southern latitude, urged the British Govern-
 ment to contribute to the work, and appointed a committee to examine and
select the most effective form of instrument, &c. &c. Anxious to be a suc-
 cessful competitor in such an undertaking, I applied myself to remove the

only apparent objection to the German form of instrument, and also to devise
such modi K cation of its details as would suit it pre-eminently for a large re-
flecting telescope. Both these objects were accomplished with entire success.

My plan, as also estimates, had the honour of being approved of by the

Committee before referred to ; and although it would now appear as if, from
some occult cause, the distinction of being the constructor of the proposed
 instrument is likely to remain an honorary one, still, as the improvements
sjjoken of are applicable to instruments of much smaller dimensions, it may
not be unprofitable to lay the general principles and results of these before

 the Association.

    Til at which the German form of equatorial seemed alone to require, was
a system of equipoise inter se, unobjectionable in itself, and which would
reduce the nature of the pressures of the declination axis on its bearings to
 the same which these would be if the polar axis were vertical instead of in-
clined to the co-latitude of the observatory. The declination axis of a large
instrument of the German type has necessarily great diameter, and its bear-
ings, if ground in to fit without shake, as they may be in a small instrument,
M'ould have too much friction ; it is therefore desirable that the bearings

should be in effect Y^y, and in order that such bearings shall be as admissible

Yas in a meridional instrument, the pressure of the axis on each side of its

 bearing should be equal in every position of the instrument ; moreover, it is
 desirable that the end pressure of the declination axis, in all positions of the
 instrument out of the meridian, shall be neutralized. These important condi-
tions are perfectly fulfilled by a system of internal counterpoise, which, being
 applied, then permits of an external system of anti-friction rollers, relieving

the Y bearings of all but a fractional portion of the remaining pressure of

 the declination axis and its appendages (viz. the telescope and its counter-
poise). The result of such arrangement may be readily anticipated; an
achromatic telescope of 12 inches aperture and 20 feet focus, so mounted
and with perfect steadiness, is moved by a force of about one pound applied

 at the eye end.

     Secondly, and for the equatorial mounting of the largest reflecting instru-
 ments up to 6 feet diameter (the size of Lord Rosse's), if required, I modify
the German type, as shown in the drawings exhibited, by placing the decli-

 nation axis within instead of beyond the larger end of the polar, and I invert

 the whole. Thus the previous steadiness is rather increased; the bearings of

tlie polar axis may both be of minimum size, and the centre of gravity of the

 whole instrument is brought as close to the ground-level as can be desired,

 instead of being considerably aloft ; also, the settings and readings of the

 largest instrument are rendered most convenient, and the observer is gene-

 rally close to the ground, and never more than a few feet from it.

    The subjoined Table contrasts the weights to be moved and power required
 for the same, in the second English and improved German forms of equa-

 torials, for telescopes of several sizes, viz.

       b. Grasses which are but pasture or agrarian weeds.
       c. Grasses which indicate certain conditions of soil, climate, &c.

   As regards the plots of grasses generally, I may state that last year these

consisted to a great extent of two sets, one planted five years before, and a
new lot now just coming to perfection, the difficulty of keeping species un-

mixed, and other circumstances attendant upon growing specimens in small
plots, rendering frequent renewal absolutely necessary. As respects the
purity of a crop, the older beds offered some most interesting observations,
as they show how in a short period one species may be entirely lost, and the

ground be taken possession of by others ; hence the following :

    Observations of this nature are interesting in a practical point of view, as,

from cultivation or the want of it, meadows are constantly changing their
contents, good grasses gaining the ascendant in the former, and bad in the

latter. In my plots, bad grasses, that is those of a poor feeding quality,

take possession of plots originally sown with better kinds ; this arises from
the circumstance of the general poverty of the soil, which is assisted by these
crops never being depastured like those of meadows, but on the contrary are
left to perfect themselves for the teaching of the students, and consequently
are annually cut down as ripened or seeded grasses, thus affording a practical
example of the injury arising from exhausting crops, besides showing that

   * These and most of the older beds have this year been occupied by totally diflferent crops,
the old crops of grasses being gradually destroyed.

many of the grasses only maintain a perfectly perennial habit by being crop-
ped off before tliey have seeded. This consummation having been attained,
many species, such as the Loliums, Hordeums, Dactylis, and Alopecums, die

out the same, or at best the second year afterwards ; and indeed in cultiva-
tion, even when cut before it is ripe, the old plants gradually die out.

   Grasses indeed differ so much in the species that prevail and the well or

ill doing of these according to circumstances, that the practical observer of

them, either in a wild or cultivated shape, or, better, both, may become

acquainted not only with the broad features connected with the conditions
of soil, but all their inflections, such as its value, the cultivation it has
experienced or that should be adopted, mechanical texture, want of draining,

and the like.

   As regards particular Botanical facts that have received illustration from
ray experiments, I would shortly comment upon the following genera :
Alopecurus, Dactylis, Affrostis, Poa, Feshtca and JBromus*. Of the first two

genera, I received packets of seed from the seedsman with the following

names :

Alopecurus pratensis.       Dactylis glomerata.
           ,, nigricans.          ,, gigantea.

   The A. nigricans I take to be but a variety of A. pratensis ; and indeed,
after three years of growth, it may almost be pronounced as identical. Both
do well ; and I can see no reason for preferring the one to the other, so alike
are they in growth and habit.

   As regards the two names of Dactylis, for they are nothing more, they are

here inserted to note with reprehension a practice too often adopted by seeds-
men, of giving a new name from some accidental enlargement of form per-

--haps arising from suitable soil or other unimportant distinctions ; and tiius

disappointment results to the cultivator, while works are burdened with

synonyms.

  --Agrostis. The last year's plots of this were as under :

Plot A. Agrostis vulgaris.  Plot B. Agi-ostis stolonifera.

These were sown in 1855, and at the last meeting they presented the follow-

ing appearances :

   A. "Presents the usual delicate A. vulgaris of the grass meadows with
a few plants of A. stolonifera intermixed."

   B. "The general plant is A. vulgaris having ?i feiv A. stolonifera inter-

mixed; and these latter present more of the A. alba form than of the con-
gested inflorescence and true stolon growth of the A. stolonifera."

    This seems to favour the view that the three forms are all referable to a
single speciesf , as when cultivated in a like position their broader features
of distinction are lost, and the seed of one, though for the most part coming
true, will still send up exceptional examples of each of the others ; but the
diversity of conditions under which the three forms occur in nature seems
sufHcient to account lor the different aspect which they assume, such as

   A. vulgaris, common to upland meadows.
   A. alba, in ditches and damp places.
   A. stolonifera, in stony brashes, mostly an accompaniment of agrarian con-

ditions.

* Avena and iEgilops to be noticed in the Cereal list.
f This is more strongly confirmed in the present year, 1857, as now

  APlot is attaining the size and appearance of A. alba.
   Plot B is nearly all A. alba. These plots are on a thin clay bed.
EXPERIMENTS ON THE GROWTH OF PLANTS.                                  203

   PoA. Of this genus, among other species the two following were sown
side by side.

P. aquatica {Glyceria).                    P.fluitans {Glyceria).

   These were sown in the autumn of 1855. During 1856 stiff and sturdy
sliort-and rigid-leaved plants were forming ; these leaves were so harsh as to

cut the flesh on the slightest touch. During the present year, 1857, they

have flowered, and to my utter astonishment the plants of both plots are the
same ; the culms were as much as a yard in height, and the flowers so small
and ovate as quite to justify the retaining of the generic name of Poa for the

whole group.
   While these grasses were flowering, I watched them from day to day with

great interest, as in all their parts they differed so much from any known
species; the short rigid leaves with the angular sheath, and the elegant panicle
of flowers from their size, and the rigidity of the whole plant removed these
far from the P. pratensis, and the whole details differed so much from the
forms whose seed was sown as well as from all other recognised forms, that
while it showed me I could not have mistaken my seed, it also was con-
vincing that I had obtained a new and singular variety. This indeed is not
to be wondered at when we consider that both the forms, the aquatica and
fluifans, absolutely grow in the water ; but here I had got them to grow in an
upland situation, and to manage like other upland grasses with only water
from rain. Still the change was so curious, that I was anxious to re-examine
the seeds as sown ; and fortunately some of the packets were saved, and I

can pronounce them true as named*.

    Here then I cannot help concluding that even such dissimilar grasses as

the typical forms of P. aquatica and P.fluitans are not specifically distinct
and though the former in its wild state bears a large and diffuse panicle of
flowers, and the latter is almost as spicate as a Lolium, yet we may, I think,
connect the evidence here presented to us with that obtained in the growth
of the Festiica loliacea pratensis and elatior presently to be detailed.

   However, I shall not conclude my experiments upon this subject without

sowing some new plots with seeds of the hitherto supposed species gathered
by myself for the express purpose ; not that I in the least doubt these experi-

--ments, but in order, if possible, to note the changes more clearlyf.
   Festuca. The species to be communicated upon I shall divide into two

groups.                                    b. Festuca loHacea.
            a. Festuca ovina.
                                                     ,, p pratensis.
                        ,, j8 duriuscula.             ,, y elatior.
                      ,, y rubra.
                          ,, Itenuifolia.

   (I. These were sown six years since in three distinct plots, and they soon
established themselves in a separate tufted method of growth. The first two

years they were readily distinguishable; now, however, the follo\ving facts

are observable.

   F. ovina is about eighteen inches high; F. tenuifolia, duriuscula and
rubra differ but slightly in size, and scarcely in details, and the creeping

habit of root of the latter is entirely lost J.

   It may be remarked that the F. rubra is not amongst our wild forms at

Cirencester, but I have occasionally met with specimens of F. duriuscula in

the road dirt with which the tops of our stone walls are frequently capped,
having a decidedly creeping habit which, if shown as a tendency " in light
sandy pastures near the sea" which is given by Hooker as the habitat of the
F. rubra, may account for the difference.

   As respects the varieties F. ovina, ienuifoUa and duriuscula, it may be
remarked that poor uplands present the first, the bushes and hedgerows
around these the second, and meadows examples of the latter ; but seldom
are they greatly intermixed, which, perhaps, may be taken as an argument
that these forms are but varieties induced by different circumstances. From
long observation and experiment I can only so consider them ; and had I a
choice of names for the typical form, 1 should choose that of duriuscula, as
the departure seems to be from that type, of which F. ovina is a mountain
form, and F. rubra a seaside or arenaceous one.

    b. Festuca loliacea varieties.
    Six years since, I sowed the seeds of the three forms as below, and in the

following order.

Festuca loliacea.       Festuca pratensis.  Festuca elatior.

 --These plots the first year of flowering presented appearances as under:

   1st. Festuca loliacea. Most of the plants of the true spicate type, but
sparingly mixed with paniculate flowers : the herbage of which was of the

--rich green which characterizes F. loliacea.
    2nd. Festuca pratensis. All true, but with a tendency to a rigidity of

leafage.

3rd. Festuca elatior, scarcely distinguishable from (2).

In three years great changes had been wrought as under :
-- No1st. F. loliacea.
                        spicate flowers.
--2nd. F. pratensis. More rigid and larger, in fact none of the true mea-

--Adow type.         little larger, but otherwise not distinguishable from
   3rd. F. elatior.

(2).

    In the fifth year the F. elatior prevailed in all the beds.
   These plots are destroyed, as in 1855 the same experiments were recom-
menced in another part of the garden, the plots, however, being placed at a
distance apart; and the present year they were plainly observed to be taking

the same course as the others.
   Here then, I think it satisfactorily proved by experiment that these three

forms are all of them referable to a single species, as the changes indicated
have taken place in individuals ; they, however, maintain their distinctive
characters under the following circumstances.

   In meadows by the sides of rivers subject to occasional floods, as the Isis
at Oxford, or irrigated meadows, as on the banks of the Churn at Cirencester,
F. loliacea is constant in its characters, and is a most valuable grass for hay

or pasture.

  --In rich meadow flats, as in the Vale of Berkeley the celebrated country

--of the " double Gloucester cheese," the F. pratensis is a common and valu-

able denizen, and any meadow where it maintains its character may be consi-

dered as of good quality.
EXPERIMENTS ON THE GEOWTII OF PLANTS.  205

   On the alluvial sandy clay banks by the seaside, or poor siliceous clays

inland, the F. elatior rears its tall coarse form. In Gloucestershire the

banks of alluvial mud thrown up to prevent the encroachments of the water

in the Severn estuary are always occupied by this grass, which I look upon
only as the extension of the prafensis from the rich flats within this boundary.

   The F. prafensis is a grass which is usually recommended for admixture
in forming new pastures, on which account there can be but little doubt that
it was used in the glades laid down within the last few years at the entrance
of Oakley Park, the seat of the Earl Bathurst. When first sown it came up

true enough, though with a disposition to reediness ; the last four years it has
become wholly F. elatio?- in all its features, and is now in such large coarse

" hassocks" as to be dissightly as a lawn, and much impairs the hay or pas-
ture. The secret of all this appears to be that here it was sown on the forest

marble sandy clays, the texture of which as a soil is similar to that in the
favourite habitat of this form of grass, and this too, though in a less degree,

no doubt, favoured the changes as observed in ray botanical garden.

   Here then we see, in these forms of Fescue, plants which assume what
have been taken as specific characters, not only from change of circum-
stances giving rise to varieties which have been obtained from different
generations by seeding, but these have assumed the form of varieties from
the same seed and plants, and absolutely becoming F, pratensis, and after-

mywards F. elatior from the typical F. loliacea : and so certain is this in

experimental garden, that the result of twice sowing these three forms from
seed from different seedsmen has been the permanent establishment of F.

elatior in all three plots.

    JBromus mollis varieties.

   My experiments and observations upon the annual forms of Brome, though

still in progress, yet seem to warrant a diminution in specific names; for

example, B. mollis and B. racemosus of authors are sure to be intermixed to
a greater or less extent from the same seed ; thus the seed of the B. mollis
will have a sprinkling of the racemosus, whilst seed of the latter will present

exceptional examples of the former; and, besides, all distinction is lost in
every shade of intermediate form by which the hairy and smooth varieties

are connected.

   Again, as regards B. eommutatus, this is by far too common a grass in pas-

tures subject to floods and in irrigated meadows, in which situation the
B. mollis is quite exceptional. Now, as I have watched the laying out
of poor pastures as irrigated meadows, I have always observed that two or
three years is often sufficient to change the B. mollis which was alone before

Binto commulatus. Of course it may be considered that this was in virtue

of that law of substitution of one species for another which so universally

occurs on a change of soil and other conditions ; but I incline to the belief
that much of this is after all due to a change of form and specific character,
and as regards the grass under consideration our chain of evidence is nearly
complete when it is stated that the B. eommutatus from the irrigated mea-

dows, most certainly in experiments in my garden, has resulted in fine exam-
ples of B. secalinus, a form not before known there, and therefore not liable
to have led me into error, as would be the case where the diflPerent varieties

 are wild natives near the spot.
    I have not been able to experiment upon the whole of the forms of what

I would term the B. mollis group, but I suspect that the B. arvensis which I
this year found so abundantly on the c"halk about Avebury, in Wiltshire, is
 but a form of the same ; and though in all probability a foreign one intro-
duced with "seeds," yet its individuality may have been implanted by

a. The Peruvian Barley was sown on account of the interest of this variety,

and also to occupy six large plots which were last year planted with Swede

Turnips : five plots with different manures, and one without manure for
comparison. The whole of the Turnip experiments, when complete, will

form a substantive report, I hope, next year. It may be enough here to

state that the result in the Turnips was widely different, but I could trace

no difference in the Barley.

h. For two autumns past I have sown wheat at different depths, from one

Myto seven inches.  crop of 18.56 came up tolerably regular, and that from

two to four inches in depth was certainly the best, the deeper sown being

thin, and tillering but indifferently : this year, however, the deeper sown is

very thin, and consequently with fine large ears, whilst that at less depth

is still more irregular and weaker, probably arising from injury caused by
wire worms. These experiments will be again repeated, and they are now

only noted, not to show any conclusions that have been arrived at, but to
point out how unsafe it is in agricultural experiments to generalize from a

single set of experiments, as these are so liable to be interfered with by in-

sects, climate, and a variety of causes.

  c. When last year I had the pleasure of laying my notes upon these

experimental plots before the Section of the British Association, the early

period at which we met and the general lateness of the season prevented my

being enabled to report upon some experiments in oat transmutation which

the ripening of my crops subsequently showed to be of great interest ; and

as the interest consists in the fact that the Avena fatua has been made to

assume the forms of different varieties of cereal or cultivated oats, I shall now

detail the steps taken in bringing about this change*.

It is now six years since on a neighbouring farm, in a patch of seeding man-

gold wurtzels grown on forest marble, I observed an abundance of Avena

fatua; and as this wild grass is a great pest, especially in clay districts, such as

those on the Lias of the Vale of Gloucester and the Oxford Clay in Wilts, but

comparatively rare on the Oolite brashes, I took a class of students to exa-

mine it and gather specimens for the Herbarium, at the same time giving
them a field lecture upon this pest, in which I adverted to a tradition among

the farmers of the Vale of Gloucester, that " they were prevented from grow-

ing oats because they degenerated into wild oats;" and it was with a view

of determining if possible from experiment whether this notion was correct,

that I afterwards gathered some of the ripe seed of the wild oat, which in the

following spring I sowed in one of my plots. It came up very well, and the

process was repeated the following season in another part of the garden, and

--in the autumn of 1855 I thought I remarked the following changes :
  A1. lighter-coloured fruit.

* Specimens of these changes accompanied the Report.
EXPERIMENTS ON THE GROWTH OF PLANTS.  207

  A2. less degree of hairiuess when compared with the fruits of iho true

A.fatucu

  A3. greenish coloured, straight and slight awn. instead of the black, bent

at right angles, and twisted at the lower part of the very rigid awn of the

wild plant.

   4. The fruits were more frequently two than three perfect ones to each

glume.

   5. The fruits were much more plump, arising from a greater development
of grain than in A. fatua.

   6. The ripe fruits separated from the floral envelope less readily than in
A. fatua.

    In following out the experiments in the spring of 1856, the best specimens
having been selected for seed were again sown ; and in the month of September

following, when this crop was gathered, the results were as under.
    1st. Avena/atua, tolerably true, though perhaps not so coarse and strong

as is usual on heavy clays.
   2nd. Avena fatua, var. sativa, with a diffuse, spicate, pyramidal panicle,

allied to the form called " Potatoe Oat," by farmers.
   3rd. Avena fatua, var. sativa, with a compact panicle of flowers tending

to one side, allied to the agricultural form known as " Tartarian Oats."
    The two latter presented various shades of advance ; a few of the more

changed were awnless, but most of them possessed awns which were very
coarse and rigid for what we may terra " tame oats ;" and the grain was by
no means so plump as (when compared with its thick envelope) to entitle it
to be called a good oat. However, it was sufiiciently striking, and, on the
whole, much more sudden in its advance than I had calculated upon. But

to proceed.

     In the present year, 1857, I planted the sorts, carefully separated, in

separate patches of larger size, with the following result as to the crops.

   a. The plot of Avena fatua is again mixed with many examples of the

Potatoe form of oat, but none of the Tartarian type.

   b. The Potatoe oats have a plumper seed and are much less awned ; some

examples are however still rigidly awned.
    c. The Tartarian form is much larger than is usually grown in the best

cultivation, its grain very fine, some awned, but mostly awnless.
    Thus far then have these curious experiments proceeded. Next year they

will be transferred to the field, in the hope of perpetuating these new
varieties, as they promise to be much more vigorous than the older ones
and this indeed is one of the advantages in agriculture of new sorts, as, for a
 time at least, they usually succeed better than the older ones. But this is a
 matter I must not stop now to discuss.

     It should be remarked that the shed seeds of the plot of 1856 were care-
 fully dug in, in the hope that, by being allowed to deposit their seeds as in

nature, the whole may again degenerate into wild oats ; but only one speci-
 men, and that of Afatuu, came up, for, having been so long submitted to

 cultivative processes (and the gathering and storing of seed previously to
 sowing is a very important one), they have little disposition to come up
 wildly afterwards, a fact which is more observable in some situations than in

 others ; and acting upon this hint, I am not quite sure whether the best way
 to get rid of some weeds would not be to carefully cultivate them.

    These experiments are of interest as showing what may be done in this
 direction towards elucidating some curious facts in vegetable physiology.
 They are no less so to the agriculturalist, as the remark of the old farmer,
 which was never a favourite one with the botanist, is now known to be true
208 REPORT-- 185/.

for if we can by experiment advance tiie vvild oat to the cultivated state, so

the cultivated by degenerating may relapse into the wild state. That the

latter position is true, I iiad long known from an examination of the produce

of shed oats around riclcs and in fields, as some of these in a single year will

be seen to possess a few hairs at the base of the fruit*, the awn will get longer

and more rigid witli a darker colour, and the seed niucii smaller. It would,

however, take too long to pursue an inquiry into the agricultural speculations

which these experiments might illustrate, and this perhaps may be better

done when our crops are still further advanced; and I need therefore only to

advert to such subjects as those involved in the growth of new sorts, the

reasons for their value, and the facts connected with their maintenance, to

prove this position.
--Myd. ^gilops.
                      three plots of this grass may be described as follows:

A1st. permanent plot that is allowed to seed itself and groiu sporadically,

which it does v/ith great freedom.

  A2nd. plot of carefully picked seeds sown in autumn.

3rd. The same seeds sown in spring.

In reporting upon JEgilops last year, I remarked upon the difficulty of

ripening the seeds. However, this is obviated, as the present condition of

Plot 1 shows it to have become perfectly acclimatized. I had last year some

reason to think I had made an advance towards proving the truth of M.

Fabre's statement as to this being the parent of the cultivated wheat; but

this year my examples have, if anything, retrograded. I shall therefore repeat
the experiments in my own private garden, which is a distance from the

College, and on a perfectly different soil. If M. Fabre's views be correct, I

should have little hope of success where the plant grows so well and the cir-

cumstances seem so suitable for its maintenance in a wild condition, cul-

tivation indeed consisting in the growing of plants in soils and situations

unsuitable for them in their wild nature.

 --3. Papilionaceous Plants. As regards this family, my experiments

tend to show that many species may be made available for agricultural feed-

ing purposes more than are at present employed; these however need not now

be commented upon. I shall therefore confine myself to an account of ex-

periments and observations on the following ;

 Vicia angustifolia.    Narrow-leaved vetch.
Trifolium pretense.     Broad-leaved clover.
                        Ziczac clover.
       ,, tnediujn.
                        Common melilot.
Melilotus officinalis.
        ,, Taurica.     Cabool clover.

In 1852 I collected seeds of Vicia angustifolia from the neighbourhood of

Cirencester, which I sowed in a plot. In the spring of 1853, it came up well;

but on flowering, only a few plants could be said to present the characters of

the species as laid down in books, or indeed as afforded by the parents of

these very specimens. The chief differences were much larger foliage, a

greater length of stem, a tendency to two flowers in the axils of the leaf

Nowinstead of a solitary one, and a great increase of size in the seeds.  these

distinctions did not exist in more than 20 per cent, of the plants; and as

regards the difference in the seed, it may be remarked that it is rare to get a

sample of seed of the cultivated vetch but will be very variable.

In 1854-, I planted the seeds that were largest and most changed from

   * I this year gathered a specimen from an old oat field on the Royal Agricultural College
Farm with four white hairs at the base, and the seeds had a tendency to separate with the
oblique scar, the grain still being plump.

  the original, the resulting crop being in all particulars the Vicia saliva of

  authors.

     In the autumn of the same year was planted a plot of the like selected seed
 and with the same result, affording stems as much as 2^ feet in length, with
  leaflets half an inch broad, its original size being about 6 inches long, with
 leaflets a little more than the eighth of an inch broad.

     From 18.'55, I have kept up a plot of each set, thus developing a winter
 and spring variety of V. sativa from V. angustifolia, whilst at the same time
 I have a plot in which the crop is permanently maintained by self-sown seeds;
 these, though larger than in wild nature, still preserve the rounded pods
 and small seeds with but little variation. The spring- and autumn-sown

 varieties are about as distinctive in appearance as are the agricultural forms

 of these.

  --Trifolium pratense. This form in cultivation undergoes great changes,

 particularly in size and colour ; it becomes many times larger, and its heads

 of flowers increase in size but are less bright in colour. This plant is found
 wild in all rich meadows and pastures ; its place however in poor sandy soils
 where lime is absent is supplied by the Trifolium medium, on which account
 the latter plant was some few years since introduced into agriculture, to

 ensure a crop where the T. pratense usually failed. The seedsmen used to
 supply it under the name of Trifolium medium, its proper botanical designa-
 tion; but it is a curious circumstance that all the samples of this seed now in
 the market are only those of a variety of T. pratense, and hence at present
 the best-informed seedsmen no longer send it out under the original desig-
 nation of T. medium, the " cow grass" of the farmer, but Avith the name of
 Trifolium pratense perenne, the fact being now well established that we have
 two varieties of broad clover in cultivation, whilst the true T. medium * has
 been lost to agriculture until it be again introduced from wild plants ; and
 the whole evidence with regard to this subject tends to show that it has not
been lost from neglect, as it has been in constant cultivation ; but it has
gradually merged into the T, pratense; and at this present moment the so-
called " broad clover" on the one hand and cow grass on the other are
scarcely distinguishable, and seedsmen are constantly threatened with actions
for supplying the wrong seed. This therefore remains as a matter for ex-

periment, not only on account of the practical advantage of reviving the lost
form to the farmer, but in order to settle the botanical question, as hitherto
the botanist has never had a doubt of the distinctness, as species, of the T.

--pratense and T. mediumf.
   Melilotus. Of these the M. officinalis and M. Taurica are kept up from

self-sown seeds, as well as a plot of each drilled in rows the latter ; J received
some years since under the name of " Cabool clover," and I have since
obtained the same from the seedsman with the designation of " Buchara

clover:" they are probably only exotic forms of M. leucantha of the British

flora.

   The Melilots among the Papilionacea and the Anthoxanthum odoratum

in the list of British grasses are alike remarkable for containing a peculiar
aromatic principle, to which as it occurs in the latter the sweet smell of

* It may be well bere to note that during the past week I have received some " cow-

grass" from Cheshire, which has more of the details of the true T. medium than any I have

yet seen : this case proves my position, because a great part of Cheshire has a subsoil of

marine sand, the bottom of the old strait which separated England from Wales, and on this

it continues ; and hence I view it only as an arenaceous form of T. pratense. But this fact

points out the propriety of getting cow-grass seed from the Cheshire sands.

  t Seeds of T. medium from different localities would be highly valued by me. No seeds-
man can now supply the true form.

meadow hay is due, and is probably the cause of the superior quality of pas-
ture hay when compared with that of the irrigated meadow, where this grass

is seldom present, as also with hay of artificial grasses technically called seeds.
    If flavour and, with this, superior quality, be imparted to hay by the pre-

sence of an aromatic species, would it not be well to mix a portion of melilot
with clover and seeds ? Cattle are exceedingly fond of it, and it is a plant
which will grow readily and yield a large return in produce. To this end I
have cultivated the common melilot, and should prefer it to the M. Taurica,
on account of its less woody structure when mature.

    These plants may be considered as biennial ; however, by frequent cutting
they may be made to last many years ; and the following experiments in
reference to this subject may be interesting, as showing the evil to the farmer
 of letting clovers (for it is the same with the Trifolia) remain too long before

 cutting.

   A plot of M. Taurica of two years last summer had one-half of its rows

 kept cut down and not allowed to seed, the other half was seeded ; and on

--the ith of September, 1856, I made the following note :
    " Cabool Clover. The cut-down rows about 18 inches high, fresh and

 green, and fit for cattle food ; the rest in seed."

  --On the 1st of May, 1857, I made the following note :

      " Cabool Clover. Tlie cut portion a tine succulent plant, 8 inches high

 the seeded part very thin, 3 inches high."

    This year each of my clover plots will perform double experiments, as in

--them I am carrying on the same observations.
    4. Green Feeding Crops. In this list I would only advert to the

 Symphytum, and Sanguisorba officinalis.
     The Symphytum asperrimum was introduced to this country as an orna-

 mental plant from the Caucasus, by the Messrs. Loddige, as long ago as 181 J,
 since when it has been recommended as a profitable green feeding or soiling
  crop for cattle, for which it seems adapted from its luxuriant growth and
 good feeding properties. It is a handsome plant, growing as much as 4 feet

  high, with an abundance of bright-blue bell-shaped flowers.
     While experimenting on the growth of this plant, it struck me that the

  Symphytum officinale of our ditches would be equally valuable if it could be
  made to grow away from its natural habitat. With the view of testing this, I
  introduced an example of the white form of S. officijiale from the River
  Churn in Cirencester, into my garden, which year by year has so nearly
  approached the asperrimum in its details, as to induce me to communicate
  the experiment to the British Association at a former meeting ; and it was
  again commented upon in my notes of last year before this Section, when it
  was elicited from the Rev. J. L. Jenyns that " the S. asperrimum and <S'.
  officinale were growing together near Bath, and that it was now impossible
  to distinguish the one from the other." Here then I think I am justified
  in now saying that there can be no doubt of the specific identity of these two

   forms of plant.

      Sanguisorba officinalis, on account of its astringent properties, may per-

   haps be considered as a useful plant for admixture with sainfoin and clovers,

  and to this end I have for years been anxious to try it as one of my experi-

   ments; but it is a curious fact as showing the position of the seed trade, that
  with as many as a dozen trials to procure it from as many seedsmen, and

   always under its botanical designation, I have never been able to obtain it,

  and all my plots have turned out Poterium sangicisorba, a plant of a different

   character, and which can only be considered as a weed : indeed the buyer of

   foreign sainfoin seed should be careful as to this plant, as in some samples
EXPERIMENTS IN THE GROWTH OF PLANTS.                                    211

a large per centage of Poterium will be present. Three plots are now occupied

with Poterium, the seed in all cases being labeled Sanguisorba officinalis, a
circumstance showing either a great want of knowledge or a wilful substitu-
tion of the one for the other on account of a similarity of aspect and English

name.

 --5. Esculent Vegetables. A constant change in vegetable diet has

always appeared to me to be a matter of such great importance, that I seldom

miss an opportunity of making myself acquainted with the growth and ca-
pabilities of any new kind that may be introduced, as well as such as have
nearly passed away on account of the favouritism shown from time to time

towards new introductions ; and as examples of what I am doing in that way

I would notice the following :

The potato yam is so much like our Tamus communis, as almost to lead

to the inference of specific identity, judging from the vine and foliage, for I

have not yet seen it in flower, much less in fruit. Its yearly increase of

tubers seems to me too small to warrant its displacing the potato, for which

Myit was recommended in the height of the disease of the latter plant.  plot

in the Botanical Garden is not nearly so luxuriant as some specimens in my

private garden, the latter being so much warmer and the soil considerably
better. Here my plants of this year are climbing up sticks and are as much

as 2 yards high ; what the tuber will be remains to be seen ; however, from

my present experience I can only recommend it as an addition to the list of

our culinary vegetables.

   Last winter I was gratified at receiving a box of potato tubers which had

been sent me by my friend Jenkin H. Thomas, Lieut. R.N., consisting of

tubers of a " wild potato," and also some of a " Lima potato." The former

appears to be a Solanum ; but if of the species tuberosum, it is very different in

all particulars from our cultivated form, the tubers of the latter are more like

small kidney potatoes. But from the leaves and the slight indication of flower,

I do not think it can be a Solanum at all : but I am informed that they are

usually sold in Lima, so that I must make further inquiries into their previous

history. I would now remark that a plot of them in my experimental garden

has got on very badly, not more than five per cent, of the tubers growing, and

that in a feeble state ; however, three tubers planted in my private garden,

though they were a long time coming up, are now very large plants, and in

full vigour of growth.

 --As regards the wild potato, Lieut. Thomas writes as follows : " I pro-

cured them from the top of a small island called San Lorenzo, opposite the

anchorage of Callao and town of Lima, in Peru, and I have not the slightest

doubt in my own mind but that they are the original potatoe, as the island

is uninhabited, and fertile only at the top (an elevation of about 900 feet),

where these potatoes grew : there is generally a mist over the top, and I think

the temperature from 68° to 70°. The blossom is the same as our domestic
one, but the leaf is prickly and rough ; I cooked several of them when I was
in Peru, but found them bitter and strong, but expect that cultivation and

--a couple of years' trial will totally eradicate that." In a letter to the author

of this report, Aug. 17, 1857.

--212 REPORT 1857.

   The experiments with these in niy garden at the College have been a com-

-- --parative failure however, about a tenth of them have come up, whilst in

ray private garden the six tubers which Iplanted all came up well, and flowered
and fruited too freely to expect much advance in the tubers ; they came up
quickly, and were in flower before the " Lima potatoes" (planted at the same
time) showed above ground. They are now before rae, and present the

--following appearance : the original tuber has much enlarged, and small and

imperfect young tubers stud the sides of the old one; they are very rough
externally, and of a decidedly bitter taste. I have preserved the roots, and
also a quantity of seeds, in order to carry on further experiments, as I see no
reason why, in a short time, I should not procure a new variety ot cultivated
potato from this stock ; but if these should afterwards present pinnate and
bipinnate leaves, it will be interesting to mark the progress of change from
the curious lobate leaf it now possesses.

   The arriving at fresh potatoes from this source may do much to settle
some questions regarding potato disease. It has been recommended to grow
new varieties of this tuber from the apple or seeds, in order to procure a

sound stock ; but this in practice has failed, as seedling potatoes have been
found to be as prone to disease as others. It is, however, possible that this
may arise from the fact that the apples after all contain the seeds of an
unsound race; and I shall therefore look with great interest to the result of
the next few years in the growth and advance of this wild potato, and I
hope I shall have two races going, one derived from the tubers, and another
from the seeds.

    Salsafy and Schorzonera are two capital roots, easy of cultivation, and
which readily store during the winter. They are not, perhaps, so produc-
tive as carrots and parsnips ; but they offer a good variation to these, both as
a change of crop and also as food : formerly they were highly esteemed, but,
like several other vegetables, they are now only found in the gardens of the

curious.

  --Cardoons. This is a vegetable very little grown in England, and yet it is

of excellent quality, and not difficult of cultivation. Professor Lindley, in his

'Guide to the Orchard and Kitchen Garden,' p. 535, says, "The Cardoon
{Cynaru Cardunculus,) is greatly admired by many, and ought to have a place
in every gentleman's garden ; and yet it is curious how few of even gardeners
have ever seen it." It progresses well on my plots, and I hope to experiment

largely upon it in another season.
    It may be well in this place to refer to some experiments which I have

now been carrying on for nearly ten years in the ennobling of the wild parsnip.
Of course it was known that our garden esculent was derived from the Pas-

tinaca sativa of our fields ; but the progress of the experiments has been
marked by some interesting facts relating to malformations of roots known
as finger-and-toe, and which will be found detailed in the ' Journal of the
Royal Agricultural Society ;' and at the same time it was a matter of no small
interest to myself and pupils to note the great changes that took place as the
experiments proceeded. The result has been the production of a good-sized
parsnip of a regular shape, but containing more flavour than is perhaps de-
sirable* ; but, inasmuch as some people complain of the want of flavour in the

ordinary cultivated parsnip, time may tone down my specimens to the re-

quisite degree. I would remark that I sadly want a change of soil for con-
tinuing the experiments, and I have this year grown a quantity of seed ; I

   * During the time that my experiments have been in progress, I have been enabled to
watch the downward progress of parsnips left from an abandoned garden ; and though these

have not even yet lost all traces of their civilization, they are essentially wild parsnips.
EXPERIMENTS IN THE GROWTH OF PLANTS.  213

shall be happy to forward some to any members of the Association on appli-
cation, only asking for the sake of information, any notes that may be made

 on its progress.
     It is not a little curious that experiments of a like kind with tlie carrot have

resulted in a failure. Upon reporting upon this last year, it was stated by
 Mr. Bentham, that Villemain had succeeded in advancing the carrot and
 some others, but had failed in all his experiments with the parsnip. This is

--curious, as showing that we cannot always command success in experiments

 of this nature some circumstance or other may be wanting, and therefore we
 must not pronounce a thing impossible that we have tried ourselves without
 success ; and at the same time it shows us that there are certain laws which
 operate to produce the changes we have noted, so that from a repetition of
experiments of this kind we may hope to become acquainted with some new

 facts connected with vegetable growth.

    An observation of some practical importance may be here noted. As a rule
it may be laid down that neither parsnips nor carrots yield good roots in field

 cultivation in a district where these plants abound as wild natives, as they
usually grow small and very much forked, digitated, " finger-and-toed ;" and
therefore, if grown as an agricultural crop under such circumstances, a much
 more careful preparation of the soil, even than that usually employed, will
be necessary to ensure success ; and thus it is that success is much more

 general with these roots in garden than in field culture.

    But, besides, this own-grown seed tends much to degeneracy, especially in
 the field crop; and in the choice of seed we should always, if possible, choose
 that from a poorer soil and backward climate rather than in poor root soils
to introduce a seed that had been grown in a district so much richer. These,
 indeed, may almost be considered as general laws.

  --6. Economic and Medicinal Plants. The success which has attended

my growing of many useful plants of this list in rough bits of ground, and
otherwise waste corners of my garden, as well as in poor unmanured plots, is

a matter of great interest, inasmuch as it shows that every bit of what is too
frequently waste ground may be turned to account, and made to yield at
least sufficient to pay the expenses, if not an overplus of profit ; one item,
however, the mere one of not losing, is gain, as cropping tends to get the land

in workable condition.
    In the economic class, such plants as flax, hemp, teasels, chicory and

sunflower are all worthy of attention as being capable of yielding a good
return, and often in most unpromising positions. I shall now, however, in

this department only dwell upon some experiments in the growth of Linum

perenne (perennial flax).

   In ISS^ I sowed one of my plots with seed of the L. atigustifolium

gathered at Hele in Cornwall. It came up very well, and in 1855 might

have been seen its plants in rows with branches a few inches long trailing

along the ground, some with light, others with dark- blue coloured flowers
somewhat small when compared with the L. usitatissimum or L. perenne;
in this state it presented little to recommend it as a cultivated plant. In the
past year it had advanced to a strong and vigorous upright plant somewhat
more than two feet in height, with handsome dark-blue flowers, indeed
rivalling the L. usitatissimum in size and beauty. As regards its fibre I
have as yet had no opportunity to make experiments ; but if in this respect
it should equal the annual flax, I cannot help thinking that we shall have
in the Linum perenne a plant of great economic value.

    As regards the specific distinction of the L.angustifolium and L. perenne,
I must after thrse experiments express great doubts; nay, I am almost inclined
--214 REPORT 1857.

to think that L. usitatibsinmm is but an annual form oi L. perenne, so that

this year I shall collect the seeds of my perennial patch with a view of com-
mencing an annual cultivation. At all events, should I fail in proving this

point, we may fairly expect other changes of great interest, seeing that so

much has already been done in bringing a little straggling linseed from its

wild habitat, and cultivating in a different soil and climate, not by imitating
its wild conditions, but by making for it a new soil, and planting in rows so

that one row has the effect of inducing the upright growth to its neighbour,

--a fact readily seen in examining the growth of my plant as its shoots first
--start in a trailing method a circumstance which shows that in order to test

the capabilities of some plants for a crop, we can only do so not by growing

single specimen examples, but by planting a quantity side by side.

As subjects for experiment, it fortunately happens that the linseeds are

readily affected by cuitivative processes, so that we possess in them subjects
capable of affording much information as the result of carefully conducted
experiments, which leads me to remark that, as there are some tribes of

plants which we cannot so easily act upon, permanency of our appointed

species must not be concluded from the failure of our limited experiments,

though, on the other hand, species must give way in those cases where as the
result of properly conducted experiment the seed of one plant can be made

to produce what has been considered as a distinctly specific form.

As regards medicinal plants, such specimens as Hyoscyamus, Datura,

Papaver album, Coriander, and Caraway seem to do remarkably well in a

not over-good soil and with but little trouble, so that where a market can be

got for the produce, it might be worth while to attend to their cultivation,

especially in corners.

I shall here only remark upon experiments with the Datura Stramonium

Aand D. Tatula.         plot of each of these species was sown side by side, the

former from seed grown in the district ; the latter from seed kindly commu-

nicated by Mr. Savory the eminent apothecary and chemist, of New Bond-

street. Of the former not one seed came up, whilst of the latter several
plants at the time of my writing are in great perfection. I am informed by

Mr. Savory that this species is highly valuable as a remedial agent, it being

much more active and uniform in its action than the D. Stramonium ; and
he recommends it in the shape of cigars. Though these plants have been

referred to under distinct names, there can, I think, be but little doubt that

they are only varieties. The flowers of my specimens are but very slightly

tinctured with purple. These plants are very abundant in the United States,

the tinctured variety being much more common towards the South than in

the Northern States, and it is not at all improbable that the want of colour in

my specimens is the result of the cold, exposed climate of my garden, and

poor soil in which I have planted them*.

   7. Weeds. --In this class I would notice the following plots : a. Allium

vineale ; b. Carduus acaulis and others.

  Aa. plot was planted in the spring of 1856 with young plants oi Allium

vineale with the view of showing my class its method of growth, 1 pointing

out to them how to get rid of so direful a pest. In the summer it had

grown to good flowering heads, when, fearing lest it should overrun the
garden, I had them pulled up and put into a weed fire to burn. The

plot was left untouched until the spring of 1857, when to my astonishment

young plants shot up, and the rows of this plot were as complete as in the
former season. Upon reflection I saw in this a lesson which I had not my-

   * Beck in his ' United States Botany' gives the D. Tatula as a variety of D. Stramo-
nium. The former is called the Indian, and the latter the American thorn-apple.
RESISTANCE OF TUBES TO COLLAPSE.  215

self sufficiently studied ; in order to explain which it will be necessary to
point out that around the bulb of this plant, will be found from one to four
bulblets, which at the time the plants begin to dry are easily separable from
the parent : it therefore happened that upon pulling up the stem, the bulblets
became detached and caused a thicker plant to spring up where I had

thought it destroyed. This shows how even the pulling of a plant of this
character is inefficacious for its destruction ; and it may further be appealed

to as one of those accidental experiments which almost every plot presents,

for it may be observed that in these plots many facts (of agricultural interest
especially) are daily unfolded by the College Garden experiments, that I

have not commented upon in this report.
   As regards the Carduus acaulis, it will here only be necessary to say that

having found a new locality in Wilts, for Carduus tuberosus, I have brought

a few specimens into my garden, and as will be seen from a separate paper

which I have laid before the Section on this discovery, I have an idea that

the C. tuberosus is but a hybrid. I am cultivating the C. acaulis and C.

acanthoides side by side, in the hope of being able to prove this by experi-

ment.

  --8. Flowering and Ornamental Plants. These for the most part

consist of such specimens as may be of use for teaching, or ornament in the
lecture-room ; and many of them afford interesting examples of departure

from recognized typical forms as to be of value in teaching, whilst others

seem to grow wildly and lose their whole cultivative characters. As yet I

have not attended to the cultivation of flowers merely as illustrations of trans-

mutation of species ; but I am convinced that such genera as Primula, Viola,
Myosotis, and Malva, &c., would furnish a vast amount of interesting matter

as the result of time and attention bestowed on their investigation.

   Here then, for this meeting, must end my notes ; if, however, the Section

should deem them, or the class of experiment they have reference to, worthy

 of continuation, the subject offers a field sufficiently wide, and, I think,

important for much future investigation and description, as it appears to me

 that it is upon the noting and collecting such facts as can only be obtained
where the subjects of them are under constant observation, that we can hope

for much light being thrown upon the at present obscure subject of specific
distinctions ; and here, whilst experiments are being made upon this matter,
it is not too much to state that other facts of great interest are constantly
presenting themselves, so that while we are collecting evidence of a scientific
kind we may also expect to make experiments tending to useful practical and

 economic discovery.

                  On the Resistance of Tubes to Collapse.

                    By William Faibbaikn, F.R.S.

At the joint request of the British Association and the Royal Society, a

series of experiments was undertaken to determine the laws which govern
the resisting powers of cylindrical tubes exposed to a uniform external
pressure, and from them to determine their strength, and deduce rules for
proportioning the internal flues of boilers and similar vessels.

    Hitherto it has been considered as an axiom of boiler-engineering, that a
cylindrical tube placed in the position of a boiler flue, M'as equally strong in
every part when subjected to a uniform external pressure, the length not
216 REPORT 1857.

affecting the strength of a Hue placed in such circuuistances. This rule is,
however, applicable only to tubes of infinitely great length, or to tubes
unsupported by rigid rings at the extremities ; it is very far from true
where the length of the tube does not exceed certain limits, and where the
ends are retained in a cylindrical form by being securely fastened in rigid
frames to prevent their yielding to external pressure. Some experiments
upon large boilers, with flues 20 to 30 feet long and about 3 feet diameter,
first led to misgivings on this subject, by indicating the greater strength of
the shorter flue. This anomalous result induced further inquiry, which not
proving satisfactory, it was determined to submit the question to experiment,

in order to prove how far these doubts were entitled to credit
   To attain the objects of the experiments in a satisfactory manner, it was

necessary that the apparatus for conducting them should be of great strength
and large dimensions. For this purpose a cast-iron cylinder C, 8 feet long,
28 inches in diameter, and 2 inches thick of metal, was prepared for the

Areception of the tubes to be experimented upon.    small pipe, a, was

connected with a force pump, and by means of this, water was injected into

Athe cylinder and the requisite pressure obtained.  second pipe, b, com-

municated with two steam pressure gauges, by which the force required for

collapse was registered ; and the indications of these were checked by a small

and accurately fitted safety valve d. The large cylinder was fitted at top
                 RESISTANCE OP TUBES TO COLLAPSE.                        217

and bottom with heavy ribbed covers, screwed to strong flanges on the
cylinder, calculated to sustain great pressure. The tube to be experimented
upon was fixed in the position shown at D, having cast-iron ends riveted
and soldered to it to render it perfectly water-tight. The small tube m,
communicating with the interior of the tube D, was for the purpose of
allowing the escape of the contained air at the moment of collapse. The
whole of the experiments were effected by means of the hydraulic pump, by

which water was forced into the cylinder C ; and the air, driven in a com-

pressed state into the upper part, became highly elastic as the pressure was
progressively increased until rupture took place. At very high pressures,

the air in the cylinder C was permitted to escape, and collapse effected by

water pressure only.

   The tubes upon which the experiments were made varied from 18 inches
to 60 inches in length ; from 4 inches to 18f inches in diameter, and from
·OtS to '25 inch in thickness of metal. They were composed of plates of
riveted sheet-iron, and the thinnest were carefully brazed at the joints to
make them tight and prevent the entrance of water under pressure.

   The results of the experiments may be stated under three heads : strength
as affected by length, as affected by diameter, and as affected by thickness

of metal.

  --1. Strength as affected by Length. The results under this head are sin-

gularly interesting and conclusive. Within the limits of from 1*5 foot
to about 10 feet in length, it is found that the strength of tubes similar in
other respects, and supported at the ends by rigid rings, varies inversely as

the length.

   Thus, taking the four-inch tubes of different lengths, we have the following
mean results derived from experiment :

               (1.) Resistance offour-inch Tvhes to Collapse.

      Diameter.  Thickness of Plates.    Length.   Collapsing Pressure.

   The remarkable differences which exist in the resisting powers of the above
similar tubes will be at once apparent. Assuming the experiment upon the
tube 60 inches long to be correct, we may easily calculate the strength of

the other 19- and 40-inch tubes, by the above-stated law of inverse pro-

portion.

   Thus, for the 40-inch tube, we have 40 : 60 : : 43 : a:=64 lbs. And for the

19-inch tube,

or \^ lb. less than experiment (2.). In the same manner all the experiments

might be taken and compared, and the law will be found to hold true in

every case. The discrepancies are comparatively small, and, as they appear

to follow no law, are evidently to be accounted for from defects in the con-

struction of the tubes and difficulties in the mode of conducting the expe-

riments, inseparable from such a mode of research.

-- AII. Strength as affected by Diameter.    precisely similar law is found

to hold in relation to the diameter. Tubes similar in other respects vary in

strength inversely as their diameters. Testing this law in the same manner

as the last, we may at once place the calculated pressure beside that derived

from experiment. Hence we have the following table:

the data of one experiment and those arrived at by actual collapse, will
be seen to be very slight, and within the limits of error which might be

anticipated.

 --III. Strength as affected by the Thickness. It is found that the tubes vary

in strength according to a certain power of the thickness, the index of which,
taicen from the mean of the experiments, is 2*] 9, or rather higher than the

square.

   Combining the above laws into a general expression, we get as the formula

for the strength of tubes subjected to a uniform external force,

Lwhere P is the collapsing pressure, k the thickness of the plates, the length

Dof the tube, which should not be less than 1*5, or greater than 10 feet;

the diameter, and C a constant to be determined from the experiments. For

tubes of greater length than above specified, a variable quantity dependent
upon the length must be introduced ; and the value of this has yet to be
determined.

    For ordinary practical calculations the following formula will probably
afford the needful accuracy,

                                                                                    a'

                                    P=806,300Xj^^^.

    Thus, for instance, take a flue 10 feet long, 2 feet in diameter, and com-
posed of ;^-inch plates. Here the collapsing pressure

                                                                             ·25'

                      P =806,300 X 1,0/x^24 =210 lbs.

per square inch nearly.

   Some experiments have also been made upon elliptical tubes; and the

results have been most conclusive as to the weakness of this form in resisting

external pressure. No tubes in use for boilers should ever be made of the

elliptical form.

    With regard to cylindrical flues, the experiments indicate the necessity of
an important modification of the ordinary mode of construction, in order to
render them secure at the high pressures to which they are now almost con-
stantly subjected. If we take a boiler of the ordinary construction, 30 feet
long, 7 feet in diameter, and with one or more flues 3 feet or 3 feet 6 inches
in diameter, it will be found that the outer shell is from three to three and a
half times as strong in resisting an internal force, as the flues which have to
resist the same external force. This being the case, it is evident that the

excess of strength in those parts of the vessel subjected to tension, is actually
of no value, so long as the elements of weakness are present in the other parts

subjected to compression. To remedy these defects of construction, it is pro-

--posed that strong rigid rings of angle-iron should be riveted, at intervals, along

the flue, thus practically reducing its length, or in other words, increasing its
strength to uniformity with that of the exterior shell of the boiler. This

alteration in the existing mode of construction is so simple, and yet so
efl'ective, that its adoption may be confidently recommended to the attention

of those interested in the construction of vessels so important to the success
of our manufacturing system, and yet fraught with such potent elements of
disaster when unscientifically constructed or improperly managed.
--220 REPORT 1857.

Report of the Proceedings of the Belfast Dredging Committee.

                     By George C. Hyndman.

In the comprehensive Report of the late Wm. Thompson, Esq., made in 1843,

the MoUusca of Belfast Bay were so far elucidated that but few species have
since been added, and it may be considered that little now remains to be
done in that department but to generalize the results, which may be summed

up at present by stating the numbers to be, of

          Bivalves,     Acephala lamellibranchiata,  96 species.

          Brachiopods, Acephala palliobranchiata,    2 species.

          Univalves, Gasteropoda prosobranchiata, 96 species.

          Univalves, Gasteropoda opisthobranchiata, 1 1 species.

                              In all 205 species.

   Of the Tunicata,the Nudibranchs, and the Cephalopods, little or no further
observations have been made since Mr. Thompson's report.

   The Bay of Belfast is a wide open estuary, without any minor inlets and
not diversified with any islands, except the Copelands, which lie at its
entrance on the southern side. It is about seven miles wide between the
extreme headlands, and within that space its depth does not exceed 10

fathoms. It is only beyond this line that the depth increases to 20 fathoms,
and does not reach 50 fathoms till beyond the outermost of the Copeland

Islands.

The only river of any magnitude deserving notice that flows into the Bay,

is the Lagan, which enters at the extreme southern point, and has in the course

of ages considerably changed that portion of the Bay, by the deposits of gravel,
Asand, and mud carried down.
                              very large area over which the tide once

flowed has thus been gradually filled up ; on it now stands a great portion of

the town of Belfast, with its numerous manufactories, places of business, and

the abodes of its stirring population. Evidence of this change occurs wherever

excavations have been made for wells and foundations of buildings, sea sand

and shells being generally found, sometimes at the depth of 30 feet and more

in places further up the valley than where the town stands. Further down

on either side of the Bay extensive changes have also taken place, by the

gradual rising of mud banks covered with Zostera, where so lately as sixty

or seventy years ago, people were in the habit of travelling along the strand at

low water between Belfast and the villages of Holywood and White Abbey.

Whilst these changes had been going on at the upper end of the Bay,

alterations of an opposite character were taking place on both sides still

further down, where, as at Cultra and Ballyhome Bay on the Down side, and

near Carrickfergus on the Antrim side, large portions of the land have been

undermined and swept away. Without supposing any variation in the winds

and tides, these latter changes may in part be accounted for by the continued

drawing away of gravel and sand, and the removal of numerous detached

rocks and reefs for building and other purposes, by which the shores have

been more exposed to the action of the waves than formerly.

These changes in the bed of the sea must have had a corresponding influ-

ence upon the Mollusca, many species which inhabited the sandy and muddy

tracts of shore having been covered up and killed ; and several species have

probably thus become extinct, as they are no longer found living : but on

this point as yet there is only negative evidence, and the subject requires

further investigation.

                                        are not so much sought after. Captain White, Har-
                                       bour Master, tells me that in his early days it was a

                                       common saying that " Mussels and Hemp paid the
                                       Holywood rent." The Hemp was then grown for

                                          making fishing gear, but has long ceased to be so
                                           used. In Benn's History of Belfast, it is stated that
                                          in 1739 and the following year, in consequence of the
                                          great frost, crowds of wretched people from Belfast
                                         and other places assembled on the Warren at Holy-
                                          wood, and, pitching tents there, lived on the Mussels
                                          found on the banks.

                                       Mr. Patterson in his ' Zoology for Schools ' records a
                                          similar case as having happened in 1792 or 1793,
                                        when about 20 families of poor people came from the
                                          interior of the country and encamped along the road-
                                         side and on the beach a short way to the west of
                                          Holywood. They remained there about five weeks,
                                          subsisting principally upon the mussels from the

                                            banks.
                                      Mussels grow very rapidly, as a vessel lying in the Old

                                          Channel for less than three months was found to be
                                          covered with them, fully an inch in length. They
                                          also attach themselves to the buoys, and even to
                                           the pUot-smack which is kept sailing through the

                                          and used extensively as bait for Haddock and other

          patelliformis                generally prefer hard ground, that is, where stones
           striata                     and dead shells are to be found to which they can
                                       attach themselves ; they are of better quality on such

                                       employed in dredging has diminished of late years,
                                       more owing, Mr. Gray thinks, to a falling off in price
                                     than to any scarcity of the Oysters, which are now

                                        imported in considerable quantitiesfrom Greencastle,

                                     has known the fishermen to obtain was 21s. per 120.

                                     They are now down to 7s. for the best, and have

                                           not indigenous, its occurrence may be worth noticing,
                                              as there is a tradition that a ship engaged in the slave
                                             trade was wrecked there, and thus the Cowries are

                                              accounted for.

dredging operations, owing to the strong current of the tides and the eddies
formed by the sunken rocks. After several unsuccessful attempts to reach
this region by Mr. Getty and Mr. Hyndman, the latter was at length, in
1856, enabled to accomplish his object through the kind assistance of Captain
Hoskyn, R.N., then engaged in completing the Survey, and who brought to
the task the experience gained under the late Captain Graves, R.N., while

Adredging in the TEgean. few hauls of the dredge produced Terebratula caput

serpentis and Propilidium ancyloide alive, besides some rare Crustacea and
Zoophytes. In 1857 a steamer was engaged, and a day spent in further
explorations, the result of which is now given ; but it is evident that further
investigation in this locality is desirable and likely to repay the labour.

 On the Mechanical Effect of combining Girders and Suspension Chains,
    and a comparison of the weight of Metal in Oi-dinary and Suspension
    Girders, to proditce equal defections with a given load. By Peter

   W. Barlow, F.R.S.

My attention has been recently directed to this subject from having been

 required to investigate, as engineer of the Londonderry and Enniskillen, and
 Londonderry and Coleraine Railways, the best mode of effecting a junction
 between the lines at Londonderry, to be combined with an improved road
 communication, for which an Act has been obtained by the Corporation of
 the city ; and the Commissioners having determined to advertise for plans,
 leaving the decision to Sir William Cubitt, an engineer justly occupying a
position so eminent, and in whose judgment I had the greatest confidence, I

determined to submit the result of my investigation to him, although the

principle which I concluded would best meet all the circumstances of the
case, viz. the suspension girder, was one with reference to which consi-
derable prejudice had existed.

    Sir William Cubitt, after devoting much attention to the subject, has fully
sanctioned the principle, and recommended the Bridge Commissioners to
carry out my design, with some modifications suggested by hnn.

   In order to verify my calculations, I have caused a series of experiments
to be made, the results of which are of so much practical importance, and so
fully confirm my investigations, that I determined to lay them before the

British Association, in order that the simple question of the mechanical effects
of combining a girder with a suspension chain, on which no difference of
opinion ought to exist, should be fully decided ; but before describing these

experiments I will make a few general remarks upon the systems which have
been adopted in bridge constructions.

  --General remarks upon the construction of Bridges of large span. Bridges

may be divided into three classes :
    1st. The Arch, a structure in which the supporting material is subjected to

compression alone, but which contains no rigidity in itself.
    2nd. The Suspension Bridge, in which the supporting material is sub-

jected to extension alone, which also contains no rigidity in itself; and
   3rd. The Girder, in which the material is subjected to both extension and

compression, of which there are two varieties; one, which is subjected to
diagonal strains, as the lattice, Warren, and tubular girders ; and a second,
in which all the strains are confined to the upper and lower webs, as in the

bow and string ; and Mr. Brunei's new girder, which is a combination of

an arch and a suspension chain, each doing half the supporting duty.
    This second variety is the most simple form, but has no more rigidity in

itself than an ordinary arch or suspension bridge.

   Of these three systems, the girder necessarily requires, from combining
compressive and extensive resistances, a much larger amount of metal than
either of the other systems, which will be rendered evident by a simple inves-

tigation, and by reference to existing structures.
    In an ordinary arch the compressive force is resisted by the abutments,

which in no way add weight or strain to the metal ; but if the arch is converted
into a girder, it can only be done by adding a tie-bar, the arch having then
to support its own tie or substitute for an abutment, in addition to its own

weight.
    In a suspension bridge the tensile force is resisted by back chains, and

if these are taken away to make it a girder, a compression-tube or bar has to
be used as a substitute for them (as in the Chepstow bridge), which tube
GIRDERS AND SUSPENSION CHAINS COMBINED.  239

becomes in large spans, with its supports, by far the largest portion of tlie
structure, and destroys the bridge by its own weight, the weight of metal
being fully doubled to produce equal strength, and quadrupled to produce

equal stiffness, if loaded equally all over.

   The great difference in weight produced by this and other causes will be
seen by comparing suspension girder bridges with ordinary girder bridges
and I will take as an example the case of the two largest railway openings
yet constructed, the Niagara suspension girder bridge, and compare its weight
of metal with that of the Britannia Tube.

   The quantity of material in the Niagara Bridge, having a roadway and a
single railway of three gauges in a span of 820 feet, is in round numbers
1000 tons, and the weight in the Britannia Tube of 460 feet span 3000 tons

for a double line.

   If the Britannia Tube had been made on the same principle as the Niagara
Bridge, the quantity of material to give the same strength and rigidity would
not have exceeded ^th part of what has actually been employed.

    So great a difference in the weight renders it obvious that the principle of
an ordinary girder involves great extra material, and it became an interesting

and important inquiry to ascertain the cause of this difference.
   The view that has hitherto been generally adopted on this subject, is that

advanced by Mr. E. Clark in his work on the Britannia Tube, in which he

--states, speaking of the proposal to use the Menai suspension bridge for

railway purposes, "With respect to the use of the present suspension bridge
for the proposed traffic, it was found difficult to devise any means of suffi-

ciently strengthening it that did not involve an almost entire reconstruction,

and great difficulty M'as similarly found in attempting to render any suspension
bridge sufficiently rigid for railway traffic, by means of ordinary trussing.

   " When the passing load is small compared to the weight of the chains and

of the structure itself, there is indeed no difficulty ; but the construction of a
platform 450 feet long, sufficiently rigid for railway traffic, almost amounts
to the construction of the tube itself."

    Although unsupported by fact or experiment, this theory has been received
and acted upon, not only by a large portion of the public, whose impressions
of suspension bridges are derived from what had hitherto been constructed
of insufficient strength, and without being combined with a girder, but it has
been received and acted upon by engineers of eminence in this country.

    These experiments, however, distinctly prove that a suspended girder, as
designed for the Londonderry Bridge, is rendered equally rigid with less than

^th of the metal required in the girder alone, so that the most important

economy arises from the combination of a girder with a chain.

  --Experiments on Suspe?mon Girders. I have had the model accurately

made, which is now submitted to the meeting, on a scale of ^rd part of the

--actual span, the length being 13' 6" between the bearings, a length exceed-

ing that of the average of the models used by the Iron Commissioners in their
experiments, and is amply sufficient, due allowance being made for the scale,
to determine with accuracy the deflections on the actual girder, although the
deflections of the chains will be somewhat more on the model than on the
 girder, from the weight not being sufficient to bring the surfaces into perfect

 contact.

    The principal object of the experiments was to ascertain the deflection of
 the wave of a girder attached to a chain, as compared with the deflection of
 the same girder detached.

     This being obtained, it was perfectly easy to arrive at the deflection of the
 wave of the Londonderry Bridge, because we have sufficient experiments on
 girders to enable a calculation to be made of what the Londonderry girder
--240 REPORT 1857.

would deflect without the chain, which being obtained and reduced in the

ratio of the girder attached to the girder detached, gave the true deflection.

  My first intention was to maice the experiments with a girder which was a

correct model of the actual bridge, which would have indicated ^rd of the

actual deflection, but I found the deflection of the wave to be so small that

it was difficult to measure it with sufficient accuracy, and I therefore had a

wooden box made of the correct depth, with the sides as thin as it would stand,

viz. ^ deal plank, in order to obtain greater deflection of the wave, with the
correct depth of the girder, and with the chain attached to it as in the pro-

posed bridge.
    I could no longer obtain the actual deflection of the Londonderry Bridge

by multiplying the experimental deflections by 33, but knowing that the de-

flection of a model on the correct scale would be ^rd of the Londonderry

girder, and knowing by experiment how much the model was deflected when

unattached, the actual deflection of the Londonderry girder is obtained by

reducing the observed experimental deflection in the ratio of the rigidity of
the actual model to a true model, and then multiplying by 33.

The deflections of this girder, taken without the chains attached, with a

weight of 168 lbs. on the centre, was -Jo of an inch ; with the chain attached,
and M'ith the weight placed ^ from the high tower, it was as follows:

           lbs.  Centre.  |- from Low Tower.

                 ·050     -005

   The ratio of the deflection of the wave at |th the distance, where the
greatest amount arises when the chain is attached, to that in the middle
when not attached, is as 1 to 10 only ; but it was evident from the large
deflection at the centre and from no rise occurring at the opposite end, that

the girder was too rigid to indicate the wave, and that the deflection observed
was greatly due to the chain not coming to its bearing.

   I therefore decided, in order to magnify the wave and make its amount
more distinct, to have a girder made of angle-iron 1 inch thick and a quarter
the depth of the former girder, but simply suspended from and not attached

to the chain.

   The deflection of this girder without the chains, with a load of 42 lbs.
placed on the centre, was r2 inch.

   The deflections of the wave with the chain attached, and 227 lbs. distributed
over the girder when the weights were placed at 1 from the high tovrer,

were with
from

experiment was repeated several times with the same result, was O'Gi inch
with 56 lbs., the deflection without the chains being 2'375 with 8 lbs., or 25
times the amount.

   In determining; how far this result was effected by the resistance produced
b}' the change of figure in the curve of the chain, I removed all the weights
from the plank, and found the result as follows, with 56 lbs. at -\ from the

high tower :

J from H. T.  Centre.                 \ from L. T.

    --·85     +-20                       +'75

With 56 lbs. placed 1 from low tower

+ ·81         +-12                    --86

   From this experiment it appears that the deflection is decreased by loading
the bridge to ^th of that ol the girder unattached, and if the chain were
M'ithout weight it would be still further reduced ; in practice, however, the
weight on the bridge will much exceed that on a model, and ^th will be the
least amount that will arise, a result so at variance with the preconceived
notions of many engineers, that it is to be expected in some instances it
will be received with incredulity ; but an investigation will show that the

result is in accordance with the law T-^-^a constant quantity.

    If the girder were supported only in the middle, the deflection of the half
girder would be ^th, but as one half of the girder cannot deflect without the
other half rising, from the action of the chain, it is reduced to -j^th ; but the
girder is not supported at one point only, but at various points, which will
still further reduce the deflection.

    However, whether this view is precisely the correct one or not, the fact is
established, that the deflection of the wave of a girder attached to the chain
and loaded as in the actual bridge, will not exceed -j^th of the same girder
without the chain, from which we may estimate the weight of girder sufficient
to produce in a suspension bridge or arch the requisite rigidity.

   In order to show the impoi'tance of this result in the cost of bridges, I will
compare the deflection and weight of metal in a bridge similar to the Lon-
donderry Bridge, with a girder of equal span, in each case assuming that
3 tons per foot on the bridge will bring no strain exceeding 5 tons per inch
on the metal.

The weight of chain, such that 3 tons per foot on the girder will    150 tons.
       not exceed 5 tons per inch, is (see Appendix B)               150 ,,

The weight of girder suflScient to give no wave or deflection         GO ,,
      greater than P32in. with 100 tons (see Appendix A) ....         15 ,,

       pendix C)

Weight of suspension ban, so that the tensile strain does not ex-
      ceed 5 tons per inch with 3 tons per foot load (see Ap-
      pendix D)

To this must be added the value of the cost of the anchorage         375
                                                                      57 »
       of the chains, which in the Londonderry Bridge will be 15
       per cent, of the iron-work of the main girder portion of the
       bridge, so that I iiave added 57 tons to represent the value

       of the cost

                                                                     4'32 tons.
GIRDERS AND SUSPENSION CHAINS COMBINED.  243

   To compare this weight with that of a girder alone of the same length and

depth as that used, which would be equally rigid with the suspension girder,

=we have to multiply 150x25 3750 tons, or more than eight times the

amount of metal ; but it may be correctly argued that a simple girder would
be made deeper, and it is therefore fairer to make the comparison with an
actual girder, of which we have an example nearly the same span in the

Britannia Tube.
   The weight of the pair of the Britannia Tubes is 3100 tons, or more than

seven times the amount, a difference which will be received with surprise;
but it is perfectly consistent with the fact that the Derry Bridge has nearly
three times the depth, and has 2660 tons less of its own weight to support.

   The weight of metal in the Londonderry Bridge does not in fact exceed
that of the sides of one of the Britannia Tubes without the top and bottom

webs.
    It should be observed that the proportion of the cost of anchorage will

vary under different circumstances, but in the case of the Londonderry

Bridge it will be under 15 per cent.
    It should also be noticed, on the other hand, as a set-off to the cost of

anchorage, that the foundations Avill be increased in a girder bridge, from
their having to support 3110 tons as compared with 432 tons in the suspension
bridge, Avhich will produce an amount in saving in average cases equal to

the anchorage.

  We will now compare the rigidity of the suspension bridge with that of

the tube.

   The deflection from 1 ton per foot all over the suspension bridge (see
Appendix A) will be 1^ inch.

   The deflection of one of the Britannia Tubes from 1 ton per foot all over

is 3-\ inches.

   The greatest wave that will be produced by a ti-aiu of 200 tons covering
one-half of the Londonderry Bridge, the other portion being unloaded, will
be readily found from the experiments.

   The calculated extreme deflection of the girder with 200 tons all over,

                                                                                                                            41'25

separate from the chain, is 41 "25 inches (see Appendix A) : ,,. =r65, the

greatest deflection of the wave if simply suspended from the chain ; but, as

the chain in the actual bridge is attached to the girder for nearly one-half

the length, the rigidity will be much greater than here indicated.
   It thus appears that the deflection of the Londonderry Bridge, with a sus-

pended girder and loaded all over, equals the wave when the bridge is half
loaded, and they are each about half the deflection of one of the Britannia
Tubes when loaded all over with the same weight per foot.

    It is necessary to explain, that the estimate given of the deflection of the
Britannia Tubes assumes that they act separately ; when united at the top
they become suspension girders, and the deflection is reduced ; on the other
hand, it has to be noticed that I have not taken into account the increased
rigidity from uniting the girder to the chain, instead of simply suspending it,
which will have a most material influence.

    I will also call attention to the fact, that in estimating the deflection of the
Londonderry Bridge, I have treated the point of support as a fixed point,
which is the case if all the spans are equally loaded ; but in the event of one
span being loaded and the adjoining span unloaded, the point of suspension
will not be a fixed point, and the deflection will be greater than I have
estimated.

    Thus with one span loaded and the second span unloaded, the girder bridge

                                                                         r2
--244 REPORT 1857-

will show a comparatively better result than with the entire bridge loaded,
but not to any sensible amount, as the same property which renders the
suspended girder rigid will prevent the movement of the point of suspension.

   The weight on one opening will create a disposition to straighten the chain
in the adjoining opening, which will be resisted by the girder so effectually

from being united with it, that little motion of the point of suspension will
occur, even if no assistance Avere given by the tower.

   We may make a similar comparison deduced from other large girders, of

which the next largest actually erected is the Boyne Viaduct: here the

     Span is              264' feet.

     Weight of effective metal 300 tons.

To find a girder of equal depth and rigidity of 44-0 feet span, we have

as

   264* : 440* : : 300 : 1388 tons; the weight of a girder being continuous
that would deflect 1*9 inch with 540 tons all over, or about two-thirds of the
rigidity of the Londonderry Bridge.

   The Boyne Viaduct thus indicates a much more favourable result than
the tube ; and, as the system would admit of greater depth, much less metal

would suffice for this span.

  A similar deduction may be made from the Newark Dyke Bridge, which

has  ....Span of opening

     ....Weight of metal  240 feet.

                          244|^ tons.

   Here we have as
   240'^ : 440'' :: 244^ : J 506 tons, the weight required to construct a girder
that will deflect 2^ inciies with 240 tons, and indicates also a more favourable
result than the solid-sided girder, but not equal to the Boyne Viaduct.
    I must not conclude these comparisons without referring to Mr. Brunei's
new system of combining an arch and a suspension chain, giving each half

the duty.
   There is no doubt, in the case of the proposed Londonderry Bridge, if the

chain was reduced to half the section, and an arch of the depth of tiie chain
was substituted, and the suspension rods extended to the arch, that theoretically
with the same metal there would be equal strength and rigidity ; but the real
difficultj' is the impracticability of such a construction : the metal in an arch
of 451 feet span and 80 feet rise cannot be measured by the section as in a
chain, from the tendency to buckle, and from having to contend with its
own weight.

   Thus in the Saltash Bridge, which is now in course of construction on this
principle of 451 feet span, the depth is only 56 feet, or little more than ird
of the Londonderry Bridge if of that construction, and thus nearly three
times the metal is required to give equal strength, and nearly nine times to
give equal rigidity, from the deflection varying as the cube of the depth.

    It will be observed that there will be no difficulty in giving even a greater
depth to a suspension bridge ; the vertical pressure or weight of the bridge is
small compared with the pressure on the arch of Mr. Brunei's girder, and as
the height is only 88 feet no practical difficulty arises.

                                          Concluding Observations.

   The important practical results of the preceding experiments are:
    1st. That in suspension bridges it is essential that the platform should be

stiffened with a girder to prevent vertical undulation.
   2nd. That the deflection of the wave of a girder attached to a chain similar
GIRDERS AND SUSPENSION CHAINS COMBINED.  245

to the Londonderry Bridge, will not exceed ^th of the deflection of the same

girder not attached to the chain.
    3rd. That theoretically the saving of metal to give equal strength in a

suspension bridge is only one-half of that of a girder ; but as it can be made
of great depth without practical difficulty, and as the deflection varies as the
cube of the depth, a bridge on this principle of such span as the Londonderry
Bridge may be made under average circumstances with at least one-fourth

of tiie metal of an ordinary girder bridge having equal rigidity.
   The results Nos. 1 and 2, although at variance with the general practice of

engineers, are still in accordance with such experience as we possess.
    Suspension bridges, with a few exceptions, have been not only built of

small depth without stiffening girders, either vertically or horizontally, but
the points of suspension have not been fixed, but simply resting en rollers,

so as to give every facility for movement ; and thus arises the motion generally

complained of in suspension bridges.
    Moreover, suspension bridges have been built without any rule or super-

vision, and as they will bear their own weight, however lightly constructed,
they have been in most cases of insufficient strength, many now existing
not having -^th or ^th the strength given in the Derry Bridge.

   In a few cases where a girder has been used, the results accord with my

experiments. The Niagara Bridge of 820 feet span has a gird^ very little
 deeper than the Derry Bridge, and is built of timber only ; yet the deflection
 from a train is not more than 5 inches, as appears from the Report of Mr.
 Roebling ; an amount much less than my experiments would indicate, when

 it is considered that the girder is of timber only.
     Another case is that of the Inverness Bridge, which has a wrought-iron

 parapet 3 feet 6 inches deep, and is nearly represented by the small wrought-

 iron model.
     This bridge has been subjected to the test of a locomotive passing over it

 on a truck drawn by fourteen horses, which produced so little deflection, as
 appears from the Report of Mr. Rendel, that a member of the Institution of
 Civil Engineers, when the subject was mentioned at the recent discussion,

 expressed his doubt of the fact.
     It is however satisfactorily explained by the preceding experiments, which

  prove that such a parapet is sufficient to render a suspension bridge so nearly

 rigid that no deflection would be observable without measurement.
     There are other cases of suspension girder bridges, viz. the Montrose

  Bridge in Scotland, the Kief Bridge in Russia, and more recently the Chelsea
  Bridge over the Thames at London, in all of which it is reported that objec-

 tionable movement is cured ; and I am informed by Mr. Vignoles, the engi-

  neer, that the Kief Bridge has been passed over by Russian artillery at a
  gallop without any objectionable oscillation or deflection. In America sus-

  pension bridges have been used for aqueducts, the trough acting as a girder,
  the success of which proves that all vertical and horizontal oscillation has

  been cured.

     I will conclude my paper by remarking, that it has been necessary in the
  preceding investigation to make reference to the existing works of eminent
  engineers. I am desirous to observe that such comparisons have been

   essential to the elucidation of the question, and that I have no intention for
  one moment to detract from the engineering merit of these great works. The
   genius exhibited in overcoming the various difficulties which presented them-

   selves during their execution must be evident to all, but especially to those
   whose profession renders them acquainted with what had to be contended

   with.
--246 REPORT 1857.

    At the time they were designed, the popular objections to suspension
 bridges were niucli greater than at present, and no example existed of a rail-
 way suspension bridge.

   An engineer might then have been as little justified under such circum-
 stances in adopting a suspension bridge for railway traffic, as he would now

 be in error in disregarding the experience which has since been obtained.
     It is still, however, asserted, but w ithout any assigned reason, that suspen-

sion bridges are not adapted for trains at speed ; my own view on this point,

 from large experience in railway construction, from observing the effect pro-
 duced on bridges crossed by contractors' waggons drawn by horses, and by
 experiments made on trains at speed with the Iron Commissioners, is, that
 road traffic gives as severe trial by troops marching in step, by herds of
 cattle, or by cavalry trotting or galloping, as the heaviest trains at full speed
 on railways.

    This is not, however, the subject I now submit for discussion ; the first
 step in the inquiry is the simple mechanical problem of the strength and
deflection with stationary loads, on which no doubt should exist ; and when
it is remembered that the extension of the railway system is much governed
by the cost of construction, of which the crossing of valleys and rivers forms
so considerable an item, that in some cases a single bridge costs as much
as 75 or 100 miles of line, I hope the inquiry will be deemed of sufficient
importance by the Association to elicit a full investigation and discussion.

                                 APPENDIX.

                                                           A.

Estimate of Deflection of the Londonderry Girder, from experiments on the
                                             Boyne Viaduct.

    The centre opening is 264- feet. Weight of girder 300 tons. 540 tons all

over produces a deflection of 1*9 inch.

    The deflection, if of the length of the Londonderry Bridge, would have
been 264.'' : 440^ : : 1-9 : 8-79 inches.

   To ascertain the deflection, if of the same depth as the Londonderry
Bridge, we have 16-5^ : 22-5^ : : 8*79 : 22-289 inches.

    This assumes a weight per foot forward equal to the Boyne Viaduct. The
Boyne Viaduct, if of the same length as the Londonderry Bridge, would

from the great depth. From this has to be deducted the expansion of the
cast-iron towers, which will amount to ^ an inch.

   The same deflection of course indicates the effect of 3 tons per foot on the
bridge, as tliis Aveight produces 5 tons per inch strain on the cable. One foot

per ton all over will therefore cause a deflection under 1^ inch.

In the design for the proposed Londonderry Bridge, ornamental cast-iron

towers arc proposed. As a mechanical question, we must estimate them as

cast-iron columns acting simply to carry weight, which, ifthey were sodesigned,

would be as follows :

The weight to be supported by the high tower when the bridge has its

extreme load, is 1500 tons. To give 4 tons per inch, we require 375 inches,

or 3750 lbs. per yard.

The high towers being 30 yards high, the weight of metal will be 50 tons.
The low tower will have 1320 tons with a full load, 1^^^= 330 inches, or

3300 lbs. per yard ; the height being 20 yards, the weight will be 20 tons.

The mean of the two towers will require for direct strain 40 tons. Add

=6050 per cent, for bolts and ineffective material, 20 tons  tons.

                       Estimate of the Weight of Suspension Bars.

section required is 220 inches, or 2200 lbs. per yard; tlie average length is
10 yards, and weight 10 tons. Add 50 per cent, for ineffective metal 5 tons

= 15 tons.

            Evidences of Lunar Influence on Temperature.

[A Communication addressed to Major-General Sabine, General Secretary to the British
                    Association, and ordered to be printed among the Reports.]

A FALL in temperature having been found to recur with some frequency

9between    and J), and a corresponding rise shortly after ]), tables and]

curves were formed in the early part of 1857; for a series of lunations, and!

a careful comparison instituted between the temperatures of the days at)

the period of suspected action. The result of the inquiry was satisfactorj\'

It appeared beyond question that decided effects (depending on lunar in-

--fluence) occurred at the time referred to ; and even that a single day the

--third before J), was on the annual mean of considerably lower tem-

perature than another day, viz. the second after }) ; the difference between

the two temperatures being by far the greatest in the winter months. These

facts I had the pleasure of communicating to you soon after they had been

ascertained ; and they were shortly afterwards laid before the British Asso-

ciation at Dublin.

The following Table was then formed of the mean annual temperatures of

eight fixed days, viz. the third before and the second after the four principal

phases of the moon in each lunation, for 21 years. The observations chiefly

used were those made at Dublin under the direction of the Ordnance Survey

in 1836-1852, and were well adapted to my purpose from being collected

in a single volume; the remainder were from the Greenwich results of

1852-1857.

  #Thus, in winter, for six consecutive months^ maxima predominate at ;

for the other six months minima, and that in much the same proportion.
In four of the winter months, viz. December, January, February, and March,
in which maxima preponderate at the period of %, minima are in excess at O-
In July, August, and October, the converse holds good. At the quarters, a
similar reciprocal action takes place in the months of October, November,

January, April, June, and July.

   i. Not the least striking fact which has been elicited during the progress
of this investigation, is the systematically unequal distribution of the maxima
and minima mean temperatures over the several days of the lunation. At
Dublin, for the period under consideration, the greatest number of high and
low temperatures at each quarter, excepting at O. occur upon the day fol-
lowing the change. In the annexed Table this will be clearly seen, as well

--as an apparent increase in the numbers as they approach the four days of

greatest action more particularly at the quarters.

  5. By the courtesy of Mr. Glaisher I am able to give additional evidence
of system of considerable value from his tables of mean temperatures of

each day at Greenwich for 43 years.
    It will be interesting to compare the maxima and minima mean tem-
peratures, which I have^extracted for the earlier half of this period (from
1814 to 1835), with the Dublin results (from 1830 to 1852). Thus the
number of maxima and minima of the month which occurred at Dublin

   It will be noticed also, that with the single exception of the day of 0> the
regularity in the proportion of maxima to minima which runs through these
figures is far greater than could a priori have been thought possible.

   6. Though time has not permitted me to enter on an examination of the
remaining mean temperatures at Greenwich, I am able to give the highest
and lowest maxima and minima in the month for the wiiole series of 43 years

from the notes at the foot of Mr. Glaisher's Tables ; the days of the moon's
age being obtained from the Nautical Almanack. The following was found
to be the grouping of the highest and lowest temperatures at the period

of }), to which attention was originally drawn :--

                                                                                                                   ])

                                                   ++
                                                   +

    That is to say, on nearly 16,000 observations, eleven out of tiic twenty-four
    highest and lowest mean temperatures occurred at the above period, and

minima only before the day of change. The just expectation would be
about 3 maxima and 3 minima for the whole period of seven days.

   The results at Dublin for twenty-two years were at

                      ·-·+D. + +·

In this case also minima precede the day of the change.
   For the rest more than half of the whole number of the superior maxima

and minima occurred on the following eight days, both at Greenwich and

%Dublin, viz the third day before, and the third day after ; the second day

before, and the second day after ]) ; the day before d ; and the days on
which the moon entered on her tirst, second, and third quarters.

   Of the six days of the lunation on which no superior maxima or minima
occurred, either at Greenwich or Dublin, three were found at #, two at 0>

and one at (T.

   Many other details of interest might be enumerated ; but when it was

considered that the observations on which they depend are ordinary daily
means, taken irrespective of the hour of the moon's changes, it seemed
hardly worth while to dwell on minute points which would at present only

complicate the question.

    7. The dissolution of clouds in presence of O) first announced as a
meteorological fact by Sir John Herschel, has since been confirmed by
observations made by Mr. Piazzi Smyth on the Peak of TenerifFe, at which
altitude sufficient heat was detected in the lunar rays to make it possible that
evaporation might cause the phoenomenon in still higher regions of the air.
It had been noticed previously, and independently, by Baron Humboldt in
America.

   A still more remarkable fact has been noticed by Mr. M. J. Johnson, the

Radcliffe Observer at Oxford, viz. that the cloud-dispelling power of the moon

Oextends beyond the period of ; or as it would perhaps be more correct

for me to say, is not confined to it. From repeated observations it appears
tiiat at Oxford the influence begins after the moon is four or five days old,

and lasts till she approaches the sun again the same distance on the other side.
So frequently had this been noticed by Mr. Johnson, that during a course
of observations on which he was engaged a few years ago, he felt that his
attendance at the observatory could not be dispensed with, however unpro-
mising might be the appearance of the night, until the moon had fairly risen ;
and over and over again when this has occurred, the sky, before com-
pletely obscured, has become clear.

    Mr. Johnson has furnished me with a comparative statement of the number
of observations of the sun and moon taken beween the day of ]) and the day
after O) in the years IS^i, 1845, and 1846, which shows that the moon was

 visible on an average 137 times on the meridian, while the sun is seen only
 100 times. In the year 184-4 the preponderance in favour of the visibility
of the moon was as l'S2 : 1.

   A clearing of the atmosphere, to whatever attributable, by increasing solar

 as well as terrestrial radiation, and so producing extremes of heat and cold,
 would, it is evident, be sufficient to account for some of the results enume-
 rated in this communication.

    The importance of Mr. Johnson's facts, in connexion with the peculiar
 action which it has been shown exists at the period of J) , will be at once ap-
 parent; and however little required, the latter in a measure strengthens the
 probability that the eff'ects which have been observed are not accidental.
--254 REPORT 1857.

   8. Before concluding, it will be necessary to explain the mode in which
my results were obtained.

   The average length of a lunation being a little more than 29^ days, and
the difference between the quarters varying from three or four hours to two
days and even more, with a view to secure as much uniformity as the circum-
stances of tl)e case, in the absence of a sufficient number of hourly obser-
vations, would admit, the mean temperatures of the days on which the moon
entered on her four principal phases were first set down as centres, and then
the mean temperatures of the days immediately before and after them, each
in its proper order ; and so with the maxima and minima of the month.

   By this method it will be seen that the numerically imperfect observations
in each quarter fell upon the intermediate or octant days ; and my results, I
think, show that this was a proper method to adopt. Otherwise, and if there

9had been any indications of a regular progression of effects from to O. it

would have been better to take tiie latter as a centre, and to have arranged
the observations accordingly.

   The investigation is now being carried out further by means of the
highest and lowest readings of the self-registering maximum and minimum

thermometer.

        Garlands, Ewhurst, Surrey.

    P.S. Dr. Buys Ballot, Director of the Royal Meteorological Institute of

the Netherlands, informs me that he has found the highest temperature to

follow on O, which he attributes to the greater amount of heat reflected
from the moon's surface at that period. M. Ballot's results are formed
from observations made at Haarlem, extending over 120 years. The efl^ects
were there too most conspicuous in the winter months.

Report on the Animal and Vegetable Products imported into Liverpool
                     from the year lb51 to 1855 {inclusive).

In consequence of a suggestion from Professor Balfour at the Glasgow
Meeting 1855, it was considered a very desirable object to obtain some
information relative to the species of animals and vegetables which furnish
the articles of commerce, and the extent to which the demand on each is
carried. The General Committee therefore recommended as an experiment,
that Committees should be appointed for this purpose in Liverpool and
Glasgow to collect the necessary particulars and report thereon. The gen-
tlemen chosen for Liverpool were Professor T. C. Archer, Queen's College,
Liverpool, and Joseph Dickenson, M.D., F.R.S., F.L.S., &c.

    Unfortunately the serious indisposition of Dr. Dickenson obliging him to
travel, he was unable to take any active part in preparing the following
Report, to which his great experience would have been so valuable; but as
it was seen that the sum voted by the General Committee would be insuffi-
cient to meet the expenses of clerical assistance, Dr. Dickenson liberally
undertook to pay any excess of expenditure, thus giving valuable aid to its
completion.

    The plan pursued in obtaining the results was as follows :
    In each large port there is published daily, a paper called " The Bill of
 Entry," which gives, besides a variety of other particulars, the arrival of
ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE PRODUCTS.'  256

every vessel, the port from whence she sailed, and a copy of her manifesto,
giving an account of the cargo she brings. By the kind cooperation of Mr.
Robert MacAndrew, a complete file of these papers for the five years was
obtained, and, books being prepared for the purpose, a clerk was employed
to go over the file and transcribe every importation under its proper heading,
and to make inquiries of the merchants or brokers whenever it was doubt-
fully expressed, as was very frequently the case. One thousand five hundred
and sixty-five of these mercantile newspapers were thus collated, and every
package imported in the five years was recorded. The next step was to as-
certain the average weight of each package, or the entire weight of each

consignment, which was done chiefly by personal application to the con-
signees, who in every instance, when appbed to and informed of the cause

of inquiry, readily gave the required information.

   It cannot be doubted that the connexion of Science and Commerce in this
practical way, if followed out, will have a most important effect upon human
progress. The man of science, by learning the particular species which aff"ord
valuable products, will by his knowledge of affinities be enabled to direct
the merchant to new fields of enterprise ; and when science thus shows its
power of being practically useful, the respect for it will be increased, which

must greatly assist in its advancement.
    But the method pursued in the present instance is too laborious and too

partial to be of any great use, except as indicating the important information
which is lost to the country for want of a more complete system of statistics.

The Board of Trade " Returns" would appear to supply the deficiency to a
great extent; but a comparison of the following tables with that voluminous
production will show that very many things are never mentioned in the
Official Returns, except under such general denominations as " Drugs not

otherwise enumerated," &c. Now it is to the unknown articles that most

attention should be given : intelligent people abroad see natural productions
which they believe would be most useful to our manufactures, or in our
Materia Medica ; they send a small quantity for experiment, which being
unknown, is entered under some general term similar to the above, and the

Revenue is satisfied. The broker, if a man of extensive business, does not
like to be troubled with small matters ; and the article is laid aside until value-
less, and then consigned to the dust-cart. In this way the importation of the
valuable Hydroborate of Soda, now extensively imported as borax from South
America, was in abeyance for at least six years; and almost numberless

instances of a similar kind might be collected in our largest sea-ports.
   The remedy for this would be the appointment of an official in the landing

department of each port, to ascertain and record every new importation.
The merchant in all such cases would willingly give a specimen for examina-
tion ; and as there are now Industrial Museums in London (Kew), Liverpool,
Edinburgh, and Dublin, the specimens could be determined there, and remain
for public inspection. It ought also to be imperative upon the Landing Officers
to return every ia-iportation by its correct name, a difficulty which would be
very trifling if either of the above Museums were referred to. One other

--reason cannot be objected to : if National Statistics are worth collecting,

they can only be so when correct ; and correct statistics must be more
essential to a great commercial nation than to any other.

Report on the Statistics of Life-boats and Fishing-boats on the Coasts

    of the United Kingdom. By Andrew Henderson, F.S.A. ^

     AJ.C.E.

The importance of this subject lias already brought it before the British

Association, both at Hull and at Liverpool. In the latter case, a Committee

--reported, through their chairman, Major-General Chesney, as follows : " It

is manifest that, however zealous the existing Societies may be (the Life-boat
and the Shipwrecked Fishermen's), neither they nor the Admiralty possess the
necessary funds for this purpose ; these can only be adequately provided by
Parliament ; but in order to effect this object, judiciously and economically,
it appears most desirable that, as a preliminary step, the British Association
should recommend the Government to institute such experiments as will
enable the public to form a judgment on a subject which is beset with

 difficulties."

    The papers and plans were published in p. 327 of the Report of the
Liverpool Meeting of the Association in 1854. At that Meeting it was
resolved, " That Mr. Henderson and Colonel Chesney be a committee for
the purpose of collecting the statistics of the design, arrangements and

dimensions of Life-boats." A preliminary report was made by Mr. Hen-

derson, but not printed in the volume of the Transactions of Glasgow in

 1855.

   The General Meeting of the Association at that place appointed a committee,
" consisting of Mr. Andrew Henderson, Major-General Chesney, Sir Edward
Belcher, Mr. John Wood, Mr. James R. Napier, Sir William Jardine, Bart., Mr.
W. Ramsay, and Mr. James Thompson, who were requested to continue these
investigations as to the statistics and condition of Life-boats and Fishing-
boats ; as to the principles on which Life-boats should be constructed; the
essential conditions of their successful use ; and the means of establishing
them round the coasts of the British Isles, and on board British ships."

    Difficulties were still found to exist in the want of funds for experiments,
in the members residing in distant parts of the country, and from their having
no establishment for the record of papers and models of the various life-
boats ami fishing- boats in use or improvements proposed. The latter diffi-

--culty was expected to be met by the resolution of the Association at

Liverpool in 1854- : " That it was expedient, for the advancement of naval
architecture, that a portion of the intended Mtiseum at Liverpool should be ap-

propriated to that purpose." The Museum in question was only then pro-

posed to be built by Mr. William Brown, M.P., whose impatience of delay

has been shown by his generously erecting the Museum at his own expense,

the first stone being laid in the winter of 1856.

   Meantime Mr. Arthur Anderson, Chairman of the Crystal Palace Com-

pany, having obligingly placed the naval gallery of the Palace at the disposal
of the Committee, for the exhibition of ships, life-boats, and fishing-boats,

that difficulty may be considered removed for the future.
    At the meeting at Cheltenham, in 1856, it was resolved, that a Committee,

consisting of Mr. A. Henderson, Mr. A. Anderson, Captain Sir E. Belcher,
R.N., Mr. J. R. Napier, Mr. J. Thompson, C.E., Mr. H. Ramsay, C.E.,

Captain J. P. Owen, and Sir W. Jardine, Bart., be requested to continue the

investigation as to the statistics and condition of life-boats and fishing-boats
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

as to the principles on which such boats should be constructed, the essential
conditions of their successful use, and the manner of establishing them

round the coasts; with £5 at their disposal for the purpose.
    Unfortunately, these difficulties still exist; the only aid afforded by Go-

vernment being contributions from the Mercantile Marine Fund, by the Board

of Trade, awarded for saving life, payment to the crews of life-boats, and as-
sistance in launching them. The Board have also deputed Commander Ro-
bertson to visit the stations and report upon the state of the life-boats and

rockets established on the coast. From a published return, obligingly fur-
nished by order of the Board, it appears from the Wreck Chart, which shows

by spots and crosses the position of the wrecks and damaged vessels on the

coast of the United Kingdom, amounting to 987 casualties in the year 1854,

that the loss of life, so far as can be ascertained, amounted to 1549 lives.

A similar return for the year ending the 31st December, 1855, has been

presented by the Board of Trade to Parliament, and published, from which

it appears that no less than 1141 wrecks occurred on the coasts of the

United Kingdom in that year; about one-half of that number took place

on the east coast of Great Britain. The loss of life from shipwreck during

the same period was, however, comparatively small, being only 469, or less

than one-third of the preceding year, and considerably less than in any

former year of which we have a record. The number of lives saved from

wrecked vessels was,

    During 1856, further inquiries were prosecuted through circulars sent to

different parts of the coast, giving the particulars of the life-boats more in
detail, in which every assistance was afforded by the Royal National Life-
Boat Institution, and by the Marine department of the Board of Trade, so
far as the examination of the official returns made to the Board as to the
condition of life-boats on the coast, and the other information now annually
published of wrecks and casualties on the coasts of the United Kingdom.

    This is a most valuable and useful document, comprising a statement of
the number of lives lost and saved, the amount granted out of the Mer-
cantile Marine Fund as rewards for the salvage of life, and contributions
towards the maintenance of life-boats ; the former being £1 384, and the latter
£962 last year. There is also a jorem of the special inquiries instituted into
the causes of wrecks and casualties, abstracts of the whole being given in
twenty-five tables, affording a comparative and statistical record of wrecks
and casualties, further elucidated by the Wreck Chart now published annually,
copies of which may be had from the Queen's printers, and are republished

in the ' Lifeboat Journal ' of the National Life-Boat Institution, to which I
would earnestly recommend all interested to become subscribers.

   It will be observed by the Wreck Chart, that there are few wrecks on the
coast of Scotland ; and although there are only eleven life-boats, Scotland is
provided with as good means of saving life as any part of the United Kingdom,
seeing that by the report of the Edinburgh Board of Fisheries, December 1854,
there were statioued on the coasts of Scotland, Shetland, Orkney, and Isle of
Man, 10,891 fishing-boats, manned by 40,359 fishermen, hundreds of which

could be readily converted into efficient life-boats, with experienced crews.
--312 REPORT 1857.

   There must be many stations on our coasts requiring life-boats, as will
be seen by the Wreck Chart, which shows by spots and crosses the position
of the wrecks and damaged vessels on the coasts of the United Kingdom to

--have amounted to 987 casualties in the year 18.'34; that of these, 431 were

total wrecks, and 53 vessels sunk by collision, making the number totally lost
484. Of vessels stranded and damaged, so as to be obliged to discharge
their cargoes, there were 462; those by collision, 41, amounting to 503,
making the total number of wrecks and casualties 987 vessels. The loss of
life, as far as can be ascertained, amounted to 1549 lives in 1854, being 560
more than in the previous year, while the number of vessels lost was 155 more

than in 1853.

   The tonnage of these fishing-boats amounts to 72,414 tons, and the total

--value of boats, nets and lines to £587,420, an aggregate of fishermen, ton-

nage and capital well deserving the attention of the Commissioners for the
British Fisheries, as well as the aid of Her Majesty's Government.

   This was aflPorded when Captain Washington, R.N., was ordered to report
on the loss of life and damage sustained by fishing-boats in the gale of the
19th of August, 1848. This Report was published July 1849 (pp. 579),

--giving the statistics of the Fishery and Boats ; the Secretary, the Honour-

able B. F. Primrose, stating the desire of the Commissioners to aid in esta-
blishing trial boats in the Fishery Districts, and a relative comparison of the
different boats. The Report contains the drawings of sixteen boats, with two
designed by Mr. Peake, of Woolwich Dockyard, of improved form, with the
opinion of practical boat-builders on the alterations proposed.

   There was also a tabular statement of the dimensions and particulars of

thirty boats, aflfording information to enable fishermen to select a boat that

would meet the requirements of each locality ; but as noattenipt wasmade to
build a trial fishing-boat, or other improvement, it is doubtful if much good
has been effected in improving our fishing boats; and only at two places have
I found that the Report was at all known to the fishermen, while a few weeks'
observation of a trial boat might have saved some of the 124 boats and 100

lives.

        AS TO LIFE-BOATS.

   In 1849, the Tyne Life-boat upset and drowned 20 pilots, which led the
Duke of Northumberland to offer a prize of 100 guineas for the best model
of a Life-boat. Captain Washington, R.N., and a Committee of Naval Offi-
cers and Surveyors, having considered the merits of 280 models and plans,
awarded the prize to Mr. Beeching's model, accompanying it by a report.
His Grace the Duke of Northumberland gratuitously circulated thirteen
hundred copies of this Report, accompanied by plans, drawings, and detailed

--descriptions of the best life- boats including those of a 30-feet boat, designed

by Mr. J. Peake, " in which, profiting by the experience gained in the ex-
amination of the models, all the best qualities of a life-boat should be com-
bined." The Lords of the Admiralty ordered that a life-boat according to
those lines should be built in Her Majesty's Dockyard, Woolwich.

  A catalogue or tabular return was furnished of the 280 models and plans

competing for the prize, giving their dimensions, weight and cost. Thirty

are described in detail ; and then published plans and sections of the internal
life-boat arrangements and disposition of buoyancy of thirteen boats, com-
mencing with Beeching's Prize Model, which is stated to be ballasted with two
tons of water and half-a-ton of iron keel, by means of which, and raised air-
cases in bow and stern, it was stated she would right herself when upset.

   There are other life-boat constructors who have spent much time and
money in completing their inventions, without being able to bring them into
                                             ;

practical use, particularly the Rev. J. S. Berthon, who proposed the Fareham
or Collapsing Life-boat. Although his boats have been in use for three years,
he has only succeeded in building two boats for Her Majesty's Navy, not
yet placed in service. Mr. Clarkson has had a boat in use for some time
on the coast, constructed of a mixture of cork and india-rubber. Mr. Asley
has patented a life-boat of peculiar form, having a hollow bottom, of which
a model is exhibited, and lies now at Dover. The fishermen's life-boat
before mentioned, built by myself, has been tried on the Mersey for two years
past, in the hope of establishing her on the neighbouring coast.

   In collecting the statistics of the design, arrangements, and dimensions of
life-boats, at the desire of the British Association, I have availed myself of
the before-mentionedReportof Captain Washington on Fishing-boats,in 1849,
and of the plans and tabular statements of dimensions in the Northumber-
land Report on Life-boats, in 1851, and have continued these to 1853, with
additional particulars, defining the displacement, bulk, space, resistance, and
form, exemplified by diagrams of midship sections, as affording a closer ana-
lysis of their relative sizes, proportions, properties and capacity, and their
comparative efficiency.

 --TABULAR RETURN OF FISHING-BOATS AND LIFE-BOATS. COMPARATIVE

                                 PLAN OF MIDSHIP SECTIONS.

   The Tabular Return is adopted as the most convenient mode of re-
cording the design, arrangements, and dimensions of the life-boats and
fishing-boats on our coasts, adding, for comparison, the particulars of
Chinese, Bombay, Malay, Arab, and American fishing-boats, as to life-
boats. Several of the most efficient of the original life-boats, as well as
those of improved construction and recent design, are included in the
Tabular Return, so as to afford a comparative analysis of their respective
properties, which are further explained in the remarks on each boat
some by printed diagrams, and others by lithographed working draw-
ings and printed descriptions, 500 copies of which have been gratuitously
circulated at the meetings of the Association at Liverpool, Glasgow, and
Cheltenham, and may now be obtained by gentlemen interested in the subject,
in the hope of collecting further information as to the boats actually in use
on the coasts of England and Ireland. For the coasts of Scotland, information
may be obtained from the Annual Report of the Edinburgh Board of
Fisheries, who, with an organized staff of fishery officers on the coast, and the
able supervision of the Secretary, Mr. Primrose, have done much to increase
the fisheries and improve the harbours on the coast. These tabular returns
are made separately, for the original life-boats and designs, and for forming
comparisons with the other returns of the life-boats and fishing-boats on the
coast of Scotland, on the east coast of England, on the southern coasts of
England and Wales, and on the coast of Ireland. The Annual Report of the
Commissioners of the Irish Fisheries is also published.

    In stating the peculiarities and services, or describing the boats, they will be
referred to by the initial letteror the number of the line on each separate return.

   A reference to the Statistical Statement will show the position of the life-

boats and fishing-boats on the coast in 1855; the Tabular Return will
show the particulars of those established in 1856; while, by inspection of
the Wreck Chart, it will be seen where the life-boats are wanted, or are
more urgently required ; the number and description of fishing-boats on
those parts of the coast being an important consideration in determining
what description or type of life-boat is most suitable to those localities, and in
which the crews are likely to have confidence. In like manner, the improve-
--314 REPORT 1857-

merits that may be introduced in the fishing-boats, the opinions and even
prejudices of those who risk their lives, and have practical experience, should

have due consideration.
   There not being time to go into the details of dimensions as shown in the

first four columns, it will be useful to state shortly their relative properties

--under the following heads : The proportion is shown by the ratio of the

length and depth to the breadth in the 5th and 6th columns. The 7th

column shows the external bulk in cubic feet to the height of the gunwale

or deck. The 8th and 9th columns show the least draught of water,

and the 10th column shows the area of the midship section, the principal
elements of resistance combined with displacement. The 11th column is
the angle of rise of floor, as shown in the Diagram of Sections. The 16th
column records extra buoyancy, showing their capabilities as life-boats; and

the cost, an important object in fishing-boats.

  A view of this comparative analysis of the proportions of twelve life- boats

and ten fishing-boats shows considerable difference in their proportions,

form and fitting. Their size, bulk, or capacity for burthen, seem to have
little reference to the cost. The Scotch fishing-boats (Buckie) of 1851 cubic

feet bulk, cost only £60; while an English boat (Deal) of 1478 feet bulk,

costs £'275.

   The lines of the Masula boat and Greathead's may be said to represent

--the type of the original liie-boats in Asia and Europe the Masula boat on tlie

Madras coast being the oldest, cheapest, and probably the best. It is a flat,

broad boat, built of light timber, sewed together in broad strakes, its only

fittings being brushwood in the bottom ; it goes through a very heavy surf

on a steep beach. Greathead's represents the life-boats of the last century.

The three next lines represent the special life-boats, elaborately fitted with

valves and platform, including the Shields boat, Mr. Beeching's Prize Model,

and Mr. Peake's first boat, altered at Woolwich in 1851-52.

The five next represent the light or ship's life-boats of Mr. George Palmer,

M.P. ; Costain of Liverpool ; Francis of America; White of Cowes ; and A.
Henderson's ship's life-boat. The 11th line details the peculiarities of

Beeching's Prize Model boats, which after several upsefs, two drowning their

crews at Lytham and Rhyl, have been removed from all the stations, or have
had their fittings altered. That at Lytham is now replaced by one of the

new boats built on Mr. Peake's principle.
   The peculiarities of Mr. Beeching's Prize Model and the causes of failure

are further explained by a diagram of midship sections and fittings appended

to this Report.

The 13th line gives the dimensions of Peake's life-boats of 1856, with all

the improvements in the fittings, obtained from the experience of some forty

boats, built for the National Life- Boat Institution, and the necessary removal

of Beeching's Prize Model fittings from all the life-boats under the control

of the Committee of Naval Officers, who awarded the piize to the models in

A1851.  detailed specification, section, body and sheer plan of these com-

plete coast life-boats is appended to this Report.

The 12th line gives the details of Henderson's Fishermen's life-boat, built

at Liverpool in 1852, with experimental alterations made in 1853 and 1854,

after trials on the coast by fishermen as to rig and fitting ; the improvements

being mainly the adaptation of the Chinese system of stretchers to the lug

sails now used on our coasts, with moveable step to the mast, so extensively

used by Chinese fishing-boats. There is also an iron drop-keel, as used in
American boats. The proportions and forms of the boat are a modification

of those of the Shetland fishing-boat and Yorkshire cobble.

          STATISTICS OF LIFE-BOATS AND PISHING-BOATS.  315

   The life-boat fittings are the result of practical experience in their adapta-
tion to Francis's corrugated iron boats, and costly alterations in this boat for
combining the buoyancy of timber with the strength of angle-iron frames.
The life-boat fittings are so arranged as not to interfere with her usefulness

as a fishing-boat, while, being only loose cork and casks, they can be placed in

Athe boat while the life-boat's crew are collecting.  full description with

section and sheer plan is appended to this Report ; and a lithographic spe-

cification and building draft of this, as well as of the ship's life-boat, has been

circulated amongst those interested in building and improving boats. There

will be found on the back of the Tabular Return, a lithographic comparison

of the midship section and water-lines of most of the life-boats enumerated,

including the Tubular Life-boat, ' Challenger,' designed by Mr. Richardson,
one of which is now stationed at Rhyl.

 --There are also the midship sections of the following fishing-boats (the
--proportion, bulk, displacement and arc of midsection, are recorded in the

Tables): Buckie Herring boat; Tobermory open boat; Aberdeen and
Newhaven open boats ; the Deal lugger ; Penzance or Cornish fishing lugger
the ("hinese fishing-boat; and the Bombay fishing-boat.

   The Tabular Return contains the builders and stations in 1856 of all the
life-boats stationed on the coast, from the record of the Board of Trade
and Royal National Life-Boat Institution.

   It is to be hoped that by a continuation of these inquiries we may obtain
the same information as to the fishing-boats on our coasts as we now have

as to life-boats; for although it has occupied seven years to bring the life-

boats to their present state of efficiency, it may be expected to take a much

longer time to promote an improved construction of fishermen's boats, inas-

much as while the number of life-boats is under 300, that of fishing-boats

exceeds 10,000.

   The initiation was taken in 1849, by the publication of Capt. Washington's
Report and plans of fishing-boats, but no progress has been since made ; the
only public body in any way representing the fishermen on our coasts being
the Fishing Board of Scotland, which has mainly directed its attention to the
curing of fish and to the improvement of the harbours.

   Moreover, the Fishing Board being subject to parliamentary inquiry, and

uncertain as to its being maintained, may have prevented any efforts at im-

provement. A Commission which was appointed in 1856, and whose report was

published in 1857, has confined its inquiries to the expediency of continuing

Wethe Board, and to the grants for harbours.  must look to private efforts

and enterprise to effiect any improvement in fishermen's boats, and follow the

example set by the Duke of Northumberland, in off'ering a premium for the

best fishermen's boat, and give effect to the competition by building experi-

mental trial boats suited to the different localities, and making such altera-
tions as practice proves necessary to meet the requirements of each fishing

station.

This system has been carried out so admirably with life-boats, that I will

briefly detail the progress of improvement, by describing the original Prize
life-boat that was considered the best of 260 models submitted for competi-
tion to a committee of naval officers, who printed an able report, of which

1300 copies were circulated by the Duke of Northumberland. After costly
alterations in the Northumberland life-boat at Woolwich, and many repeated
alterations in form and fitting, and after constructing 40 boats, Mr. Peake of
Woolwich Dockyard perfected the design which is illustrated by the accom-
panying Diagram and Plan, and shown in the model on the table and plans

on the wall.
--316 REPORT 1857.

   The peculiarities of Mr. Beecliing's model and patent mode of fitting life-
boats will be seen by reference to the annexed diagram of the midship sec-
tion, from a drawing and specification of a 28-feet boat, which was tried at
Woolwich dockyard in November 1851, in the presence of the Committee
who awarded the prize. This boat, estimated at 22 cwt., weighed 29^ cwt.,
and with oars, sails, and crew, 50 cwt. She had 1 9 cwt. of water ballast, and
when upset under a crane righted herself readily. With crew on board, she
drew 20 to 21 inches of water, the tubes admitting water 4 or 5 inches on
top of platform. (See diagram.) This boat was sent to Teignmouth and
tried 15th January, 1852, and when turned over under the crane laid bottom
up three or four minutes, and with a crew of twelve men the water rose to
within 2 inches of the thwarts. In December 1851, the Lytham boat, of
the same dimensions, was tried at Liverpool, and when upset under the crane
she righted herself; but on the suggestion of Mr. Beeching, some fourteen
or sixteen men getting on one side, she upset, and remained bottom up three
or four minutes, till assisted by the Liverpool life-boat men, most of whom
expressed their opinion that she would prove dangerous.

                                        Beeching's Prize Life-boat.

   In 1852 the Shipwrecked Fishermen's Society sent the Prize-model boats to
Tenby, Llanelly, Port Madoc, and Newhaven. The annexed midship section

of one of these boats shows their form and fittings. The results of their trial
being most important, I will here give a description of one of them. The

platform, or air-tight deck, is one-third of the depth above the bottom. The

principal feature is the water-ballast tank, extending over three-sevenths of
Athe length and three-fifths of the breadth amidships.
                                                        28-feet boat will

contain upwards of a ton of water. The air space at the side and end is

obtained by filled bladders, Eight 4-inch tubes pass through the ballast-

tank and bottom, relieving the boat of water to the level of flotation.

/
STATISTICS OF LIl'E-BOATS AND FISHING-BOATS.  317

   Practically, all Beeching's boats retain the water at a level of 4 or 5 inches
above the platform for three-fifths of the breadth, as shown on the diagram,
and thus, when under sail, or laid over by a sea, this water, shifting to
leeward, acts as a counter- ballast; and, as seen in the diagram, the Teign-
mouth boat, with an inclination of 17°, would have her lee gunwale immersed,
and of some three tons of water above the platform four-fifths would be on
the lee side; and should the compartments under the platform not be per-

--fectly tight, the water ballast would also shift to the lee side, leaving air or

vacuum on the weather side, the alternate pressure of which and the water
on the platform actually draws the oakum from the seams.

   The selj-righting power of Beeching's boats was obtained in the Prize-
model by very large air-compartments in the bow and stern, occupying two-
fifths of the length and as high as the stem above the gunwales, as shown in
the midship section; these compartments containing 30 to 60 feet of air or
buoyancy, forced the boat to right herself when turned over or upset; but
experience proves that when often repeated, or in a sea way, its efficiency
was neutralized by leakage, the increased weight of the boats rendering as-
sistance necessary to right them. This is illustrated by the diagram, where
the curved line shows the position of the end air-cases from stem to gunwale,
which, when the boat is turned over, would be immersed to the level of the

thwarts.

                                    SPECIAL COAST LIFE-BOAT.

   The Coast-Guard Life-boats include Hink's, Plenty, and Howden's model,
the modification of the Admiralty boat, built also by Mr. Peake, and the
many boats since built for the National Life-Boat Institution.

   The result of Mr. Peake's experiments is shown by his last boat being four
times as long as she is broad, with a flat floor and straight sides, but fine lines
in bow and stern, with a considerable sheer of gunwale. Tlie planking is of
diagonal pine, and there is a water-tight platform or deck, one-third the
depth, resting on four stout pine bulkheads athwart the boat, secured to the
bottom to form air-tight compartments in bow and stern, the bilge spaces
being filled with blocks of light pine, instead of cork or boxes as heretofore.

In the midship part of the platform is a covered well, containing anchor, cable
and stores, with air-boxes at the sides under the thwarts, and air-compartments

in bow and stern up to height of gunwale. These assist in giving the power
of " self-righting," and are aided by a thick cast-iron false keel, bolted to
keel bottom and keelson, and weighing about 1 cwt. to every 3 feet of length.
The boat frees itself of water by six tubes through the bottom fitted with
self-acting relieving valves at the height of the platform. She is fitted to
steer with oars, and to pull eight to twelve oars double-banked, to carry a small
lug sail, and is provided with improved life-belts, waterproof coats and boots,
and everything requisite for the special service of a life- boat at most of the
stations on our coasts.

    Thus it will be seen that the repeated experiments of Mr. Peake and
myself have led to the adoption by both of a model very similar in its details,
the only difference being, that whereas Mr. Peake's is intended for a coast
life-boat only, useful for no other purposes, mine is for giving to a fisher-
man's boat the properties of a life-boat when requisite.

    The annexed diagrams show the general form and the nature of the
fittings and air-chambers of one of Mr. Peake's Life-boats, 30 ft. in length,
and 7 ft. 6 in. in breadth.

     In Figs. I and 2, corresponding to the elevation and deck plans, the
general exterior form of the boat is seen, showing the sheer of gunwale,
length of keel, and rake or slope of stem and stern-posts. The dark dotted

lines in Fig. 1 also show the position and dimensions of the air-chambers
within-board and of tlie relieving tubes.

   A represents the deck. b, the relieving tubes (6 in. diameter). c, the
side air-cases, d, the end air-chambers.

    In Fig. 3, the exterior form of transverse sections at different distances from
stem to stern is shown. Fig. 4 represents a midship transverse section.

   A represents sections of the side air-cases already described.

    B, the relieving tubes, bored through solid massive chocks of wood, of the
same depth as the space between the deck and the boat's floor.

    c, spaces beneath the deck, filled up over 6 ft. in length at the midship
part of the boat with solid chocks of light wood, or boxes of cork, forming
a portion of the ballast, as before described.

    D, a section of a tier below the deck, having a moveable hatch or lid, in
which the boat's cable is stowed, and into which all leakage beneath the
deck is drained through small holes, with valves fixed in them. In some

of the latter boats, a small draining tier only is placed, having a pump in it,
by which any leakage can be pumped out by one of the crew whilst afloat.

   The proportions of one of these boats are as follows :
   Length, 30 ft. Beam, 7 ft. 6 in. Depth amidships, 3 ft. 4 in., exclusive
of keel. Depth from boat's floor to deck, 1 ft. 3 in. Depth from deck to
thwarts, 1 ft. 3 in. Depth from thwarts to gunwale, 10 in. Length of end-
cases (d), 4 ft. Width of side-cases (c), extreme, 1 ft. 6 in.

                                                                            Fig. 3.

                                                                         Midship Section.

    The festooned lines in Fig. 1 represent exterior life-lines attached round
the entire length of the boat, to which persons in the water might cling
 until they could be got into the boat : the two central life-lines are festooned

lower than the others to be used as stirrups, so that a person in the water
could more readily, by stepping on them, get into the boat, which is a very

difficult operation for even a strong man to effect, with heavy, wet clothes

 about him.

    It may be observed, that several lighter boats have been lately constructed
 on Mr. Peake's design, of the dimensions and proportions of the Coast-guard

galley ; and there can be no doubt that if every coast-guard station were
provided with boats built and fitted on this principle, a very great advantage
would accrue, in the more safe and effective boats for the use of the coast-
guard, while the number of efficient life-boats on the coasts of England,
Ireland and Scotland would be at once doubled.

                                      fishermen's life-boats.

    These are proposed to be formed by the addition of moveable corks and
casks to the fittings of the various fishing-boats in use on different parts of
the coast, the practicability of which is shown by the model of the boat built
at Liverpool in 1852, which is a modification of the Life-boats of that port,
of the Shetland Fishing-boat, and the Yorkshire Cobble-

    In order to carry out this object, and to test the usefulness of the prin-
ciples and alterations I advocated, I designed a boat in which the properties
of a life-boat could be applied to the fishing-boats in use on our coast,

without impairing their utility for the purposes of each locality, or much
increasing their cost. In March 1852 the boat was building at Liverpool,
and I took for her type the life-boats of that port, the fishing- boats of the
Shetlands, and the North-country cobble, so as to obtain a light draft of

water, and facilities in landing on a beach.

sheer of gunwale, 26 inches ; external bulk to gunwale, 568 cubic feet
displacement when loaded to two-thirds of her depth, 7^ tons. Clinch
built of larch planks, on eight-angle-iron frames, having bulkheads athwart
the boat to one-third of the depth. The annexed diagrams show this, and
also exhibit the form and outside planking, angle-iron bilge, and false keel
with iron drop or sliding-keel, and also the internal fittings of platform
over bulkhead, wells, and tanks, the latter one-third the breadth and one-
fourth the depth amidships. The diagrams also show the disposition of
extra buoyancy of fishermen's cork life-buoys in bilge, and the position of
the air-casks under the thwarts, with self-acting valves to relieve the water
to the level of flotation, and pumps to discharge the water below.

   The peculiarities of construction are the substitution for numerous small
timbers of seven or more angle-iron frames, with bulkheads one-third the
depth, which give strength, and divide the length into water-tight com-
partments, admitting fore-and-aft partitions. These divide the breadth of
the boat into side-bilge and bottom compartments, the latter only being
water-tight, with two water-ballast tanks of 29 cubic feet amidships, one-
third the breadth at bottom and one-fourth at top, as shown in diagram.
When empty they would have an extra buoyancy of 16 cwt. While
full they would act as water-ballast, or be used as fish-wells by fishing-boats.
Three smaller open wells collect the water, the centre one containing two
relieving valves and two pumps, that clear both boat and ballast- tanks of

water.

    Self-righting power was attained by four air-casks, secured above the
thwarts in bow and stern, weighing 50 lbs. each, and displacing 30 cubic
feet or 17 cwt. of water, when the boat is turned over by the sea. The
annexed sheer plan of stern of boat exhibits the disposition of air-casks
and iron false keel above and below the water-line, which, when the boat
is bottom up, displace half the weight of the boat before the gunwale
is immersed, and counterbalanced by the ballast, cause the boat to right

herself.

   To test the combination of fishing- and life-boat fittings, the boat was

placed at the disposal of four fishermen experienced in the estuary off the

 Mersey and the Dee, and employed in trawling off Hoylake, in company
with numerous fishing-boats, which were made shorter and of greater
breadth, drawing 2 to 3 feet more water, and having three to five tons of

stone ballast. On trial, the " Life-boat " held good way with the fishing-boats
while dragging the trawl, but when beating to windward, the deep-keel

fishing-boats were more weatherly ; and the fishermen stated that the life-
boat was too buoyant or floaty, and that there w£is difficulty in keeping the

fish-wells water-tight.

   To obviate these objections, the bulkheads and partitions of wells were

secured to bottom, the angle-iron false keel and drop keel being substituted
for the flat false keel, increasing the weight 3 cwt. These have been found
to answer the purpose intended, the boat retaining her self-righting power,
while at the same time the sliding keel makes her more weatherly and stiff
when down, and admits of the boat being sailed into shoal water. She was
allowed to take the ground on a rocky bottom without injury in a close reef

breeze.

The advantage of the sliding keel, both to fishing- and life-boats, was

exemplified last year by the unfortunate loss of one of the crew of the Liver-

pool Life-boat, near Formby, who had gone out fishing in one of the small,

but deep draft fishing-boats with his son, and was obliged to attempt to land

on a sandbank, the boat drawing so much water when she took the ground, that

the sea turned her over and drowned him. With the sliding keel up, the
" Fishermen's Life-boat" would have taken the ground in about two feet of

water, where the sea would hardly have depth to turn the boat over, or pre-

vent the crew landing. With the sliding keel down, the " Fishermen's Life-

boaf'would have crossed Rhyl bar, under sail, without upsetting.as Beeching's

Prize Life-boat did, on the 22nd of January, 1853, by rolling over to wind-
ward and remaining bottom up till six of the crew were drowned.

From investigation on the spot, and from the survivors, the upsetting is

clearly traceable to the weight of water above the platform, and water-ballasfc

below moving to windward with the roll. This destroyed the stability and
overcame the buoyancy, as it had before done in so many trials of Beech-
ing's boats. The principle of the latter is now condemned by the alteration
of nearly all the boats he has built for the Duke of Northumberland, Rams-
gate, and the " Shipwrecked Fishermen's Society," who ordered this boat

for the Rhyl station in preference to accepting my offer to place at their
disposal my Fishermen's Life-boat.

   The magnitude of our mercantile marine, the great increase in the size of
our ships, the number of steamers, and our numerous sea-going population,
make the exhibition of an improved construction of " ships' life-boat" a great
desideratum. Following in the steps of my respected friend, the late George

 nary use at sea. Bearing in mind the necessity of their being light and
strong, and the fittings such as can be easily repaired or renewed without
 increasing the cost of the usual boats, I have designed her to be built of light
 pine, clench built, on eight angle-iron frames, riveted to an angle-iron keel
 on stem and stern plate, also to an angle-iron stringer under the thwarts,
and an angle-iron gunwale piece. Bulkheads of pine are riveted athwart
the frames, one-fourth the depth from keel and one-eighth the breadth under
the thwarts. The disposition of planking and internal fittings are shown in
the annexed diagram of the main breadth section of a medium-sized boat,
28 feet long, 7 feet broad, and 3 feet 6 inches deep, having 10° rise of floor,
with the little hollow near the keel; the sheer of gunwale an inch to a foot;
the water-lines hollow forward, one straight aft ; eight thwarts, 3 feet 6 inches

 apart.

    The buoyancy is comprised in side compartments, between a rising plank
fore-and-aft under the thwarts (between the bulkheads, ^th of the breadth
broad), and a fore-and-aft platform over the bulkhead at the bilge; the
bow and stern partitions to be made up by a side plank, as shown on the
section ; betM'een midship thwarts to be filled by six air-casks or water-
breakers ; the bilge below the platform to be filled with cork: the plan will
show the position of the air compartments in bow and stern. The weight
of this boat is calculated at one ton, and it will displace about five tons,
and when filled to the level of thwarts with water will have buoyancy suf-
ficient to carry thirty men.

   The small diagram shows a zinc plug, of simple construction, intended
to be screwed to the bottom plank, where the usual cork or wooden plug
is placed ; but as the former gets lost, and the latter often splits the plank,
the zinc plug, which closes by turning a flat ridge over the faced collar or
hole, secured by screw, and costs only Is. 6d., is preferable. I am assured
that the boats can be built for 18*. to 24s. a foot, by the boat-builders usually
employed in building ships' boats, on a plan and specification which have
been lithographed and distributed, in the hope of inducing shipowners to
make trial of such a combination of wood and iron as will give the greatest

--strength with the least weight.
   Loivering Ships Boat. With respect to this very important question,
after much experience I am convinced that the mode adopted by whalers is
the simplest and best. That mode consists in strong davits, a good purchase
of two large threefold blocks, with swivel hooks, into a shackle at the top of
the stem- and stern-post. The boat to hang, as will be seen in the annexed
diagram of a ship's side, with the usual iron davits and quarter-boats.

   Our large steamers, transports, and emigrant ships, might carry a sufficient
number of these boats at davits, with the addition of a collapsing life-boat
stowed outside the bulwark, with separate davits, as shown in the diagram
annexed, to enable them to be provided with the means of saving all on
board in case of wreck or fire.

   The Rev. J. S. Berthon, of Fareham, having for years devoted much time,
labour, and money to the perfection of his invention, the following brief

description is offered in explanation of the diagram of his collapsing life-
boat, for providing abundant boat accommodation to all sea-going ships :

   The framework, which is made of wood, with bands and fastenings of
metal, is composed of longitudinal timbers running the whole length, and
hinged at their ends to each other, and to the top of the stem- and stern-
post, as in expanded boats. They are broad and deep, and extend two skins

of a very strong flexible waterproof material, the outer skin being firmly

attached to tlieir outer edges, c, and the inner one to their inner edges. The
whole body of the boat is tlius divided into as many water-tight longitudinal

representing the lowering machine inside, and the boat in a collapsed state

outside the bulwark of the ship, admitting of another boat being carried at

the usual davits.

The extension of this boat, which is instantaneous when its weight is

allowed to fall upon certain slings or spans attached to its gunwales, requires

no exertion of manual strength, and it is kept permanently open by the

thwarts, bottom boards, and certain gunwale stanchions-

The space required to stow these boats (viz. outside the ship's bulwarks

with strong strappings) is about one-sixth of their width when open, so that

numerous boats can thus be carried in constant readiness, and when in

action they are inferior to none in buoyancy, safety, general efficiency as

life-boats, and speed under sail or oars. The cost is about the same as that

of the best ships' life-boats.

   These boats have been most favourably reported on by the officers of Her
Majesty's Dockyard at Portsmouth, by order of the Admiralty, and some

large pinnaces on this principle, now built for the Government, will be siiortly
under trial in the Royal Navy.
326 REPORT-- 1857-

                            STANDARD FOR SHIPS LIFE-BOATS.

The necessity of establishing a Standard for Ships Life- Boats, and the
    organization of a Committee to investigate the question as to Improved
   Means of Lowoing Ships' Boats, and providing Life-preserving Appa-
    ratus on board British Ships.

   The first efforts to establish ships' life-boats were made by the late George
Palmer, Esq., M.P. for Essex, in 1828, when in command of East India
Company's ships, on board which, and by the National Life-Boat Institution,
they were adopted. Mr. Palmer circulated a sketch and specification of his
boat and fittings, the extra buoyancy consisting of air-cases and casks in the
wings, bow and stern, and under the thwarts. She was built as a whale-

boat, sharp at both ends, so as to be carried at davits with convenience.

    The second effort, in 1850, was the adoption of corrugated metal boats,

patented by Mr. Francis of New York. These are largely employed by

Government on the coast of America ; and by an Act of Congress, passen-
ger-ships are compelled to carry a certain number of these boats.

    Machinery is now being erected at Liverpool for the formation of these
iron boats by hydraulic pressure, as well as of a ship's quarter-boat (PI. V.),
and as these corrugated iron boats remain uninjured by the weather or the
heat of the boiler, they are largely used by steamers and passenger ships.

   Of the 280 models competing for the Northumberland prize in 1851,

Messrs. White's, of Cowes, models have proved admirable ships' life-boats,

with air-compartments between bilge and gunwale. Many are in use by the

--steam companies, but, from their high cost, do not come into general use the

air-compartments occupying most of the space, and being difficult to repair.
    The principal life-boats now carried by steamers, passenger- and emigrant-

ships are generally far infeiior to the above, their extra buoyancy being
merely copper or zinc cylinders placed under the thwarts ; these are again
boxed in by planks. Even with this protection it appears, from much expe-
rience, that the copper cannot be depended on for more than one year; and
no dependence at all can be placed on the zinc tube or cylinder. These air-
cases or tubes are in most life-boats placed so high in the boat as to be of

--little effect in fact they are only life-boats in name, and not in reality.

    The origin of this evil is to be found in one of the many inconsistencies
in the Merchant Shipping Act of 1854', some of the 580 clauses of which
enact that any ship carrying more than ten passengers shall be provided with
life-boats and life-belts, but in no way define the fittings and characteristics

of the life-boats to be carried.

    The limit to passenger-ships excludes more than half the 36,000 British
vessels, and there is no provision for the crews of the thousands of ships

 with fewer than ten passengers.

   What is more extraordinary still, there is no officially-recognized standard
according to which the life-boat should be constructed. The Emigration
 Office has some discretionary power, but practically it has come to a mere

question of whether the zinc tubes should be 10 or 6 inches in diameter,

and with the owners it is a code of £ s. d. In the majority of cases, when a

ship is taken up by Government, or a life-boat is required under the Passen-
gers' Act, experience has shown the usage to be for the owner or agent to
look for the smallest and cheapest fitted boat that will be passed as a life-
 boat under the Act, or to the fitting of the ship's boats with the appearance
of a life-boat by placing a light pine bulkhead on each side from the bilge
to the thwart, with a covering at that height between them. In the best of
                                             --;

STATISTICS OF LIFE-BOATS AND FISHING-BOATS.  327

these boats the space between this planking is filled with copper or zinc
cases; but in many of them it is only partially filled with zinc tubing 10 to
6 inches diameter, and in some only with cork shavings, so as to be wholly
ineflUcient when new, and liable to be injured and become sodden and lose
all buoyancy in a year.

    By inquiries of those interested in shipping, any one may satisfy himself that

this is the present position of the legal part of the question ; and a walk round
the harbours, quays, or docks, and inspection of some of the vessels, will lead to

the following conclusions as to the present practice on board merchant-ships:
    That the provision of life-boats at all is quite an exception; that the!

principal ships in the passenger and American trade have ceased to carry
large long-boats and yawls on their decks, but have substituted deck-houses
and two light boats on the top, and often two more on beams over the
quarter-deck, bottom up.

    That sailing-ships have usually one pair of iron boat's davits on each
side, some having two pairs ; while steamers and screw vessels have three,
and some of the larger four pairs of davits each side ; this innovation being
necessary from the increased length and depth of modern vessels, while the
numerous passengers or emigrants now carried by each render it more im-
perative that proper provision be made for the preservation of the lives of
all on board, in case of accident to ship or machinery.

    It is curious to observe in the ships in the docks, that while great improve-
ment has taken place in the mechanical arrangements connected with the
sails and engines, no attention seems to be paid to the application of expe-
rience or science where the safety of life is to be secured, by the suitable
construction of boats' davits and fittings, and the application of buoyancy

to life-boats.

    It will be seen that in nearly all the ships and steamers, the boats' davits
are only a thick bar of round iron, with the head bent at right angles 3 or
4 feet, having a double or threefold block bolted to the end ; with a tackle-
block having an iron stop and hook, the boat being attached to the tackle
by a chain sling, into which the tackle-block hooks ; the difficulty being,
that before the boat can be cleared of the tackle in a sea-way or under
way, the rope must be so slack that the upper part of the block must be
brought to the level of the sling and hook.

   Although, with an experienced crew, these arrangements may have been

found sufficient for the ordinary purposes of a merchant-ship, there can be
no doubt there is great room for improvement in the detail of fittino^
while the increase of passengers and loss of life by sudden accidents and
collisions render it essential that every boat should be provided with the

best mechanical means of being lowered in safety when full of the people

she is intended to save.

   This necessity has brought forward a number of proposed plans and

patents for effecting the object ; having my own views, I will quote those of

an anonymous writer in the * Shipwrecked Mariner,' on those of Messrs.

--Jeffreys, Lacon, Russell, Clifford, and Cornish, each having its respective

merits. The objects sought were 1. That both ends should be lowered
so as to secure the descent perfectly horizontal. 2. That they should not
cant in the act of lowering. 3. That there should be power to disengage
them as soon as they reach the water. 4. That there should be facilities

for replacing the boats at their davits after being lowered at sea.

   The first two objects were attained by Jeffreys, Lacon, Russell, and Clif-
ford's plans, but I do not consider them so important as the last two objects.
On these points, as well as the others, the writer in the ' Shipwrecked Ma-
--328 REPORT 1857.

riner' gives the plans of Mr. Jeffreys and Mr, Russell the most decided pre-
ference over those of Messrs. Lacon, Cornish, and Clifford ; they all required
some heavy and costly machinery for each pair of davits ; Mr. Clifford's
having the peculiarity, that his machinery is affixed under the midship
thwart of the boat, for the sole purpose of allowing one man to lower both
ends by two single ropes through threefold friction-blocks or nipping-
sheaves, which preclude the possibility of hoisting them up by the same

means that lower them.
    Attempts having been made in Parliament to force Clifford's patent on

the shipowners of the country, all really interested should cooperate in the
establishment of a Ship's Life-boat and Fittings Committee, to elicit the
views and opinions of those whose position or nautical experience enables
them to afford information and suggestions as to the requirements of ship-

ping, and the means of improving the boats and davits now in use, also of

providing efficient life-preserving apparatus in all ships, without compulsory
acts of parliament in favour of any patent.

   The only vessels in which Government dictation would be just, are
crowded troop-ships and emigrant-ships, to which extra life-boats, davits,
and apparatus should be provided while so employed ; and the only patent
which would meet these requirements is the admirable invention of the

Rev. E. J. Berthon, of an efficient collapsing life-boat, provided with patent
davits and lowering apparatus, which can be carried in addition to the usual
boats and davits, as shown in the annexed diagram and section (p. 325).

   As to a standard for ships life-boats, there are several different types

which experience has established as efficient, such as Francis's corrugated
iron boats, adopted by the American Government steamers ; also those
of White of Cowes, so largely employed by the mail steamers from South-

ampton ; and, it may be, there are others with sufficient extra buoyancy
to float with their complement of crew and passengers when filled by a
sea, which may be estimated at 20 cubic feet of air or cork. Considering
this as the minimum, the exact amount depends so much on the material

and disposition of buoyancy, that it can only be determined by careful ex-
periments and calculations, corroborated by records of their performances at
sea. This requires the cooperation of many commanders of vessels, who only
need that the points of inquiry be properly put before them, as has been
done in the case of the Compass Committee of Liverpool.

    For eliciting this information, the writer has lithographed a plan and speci-
fication of a ship's life-boat of 28 feet, with calculations of weight less than
one ton, the hull and fittings having a buoyancy of about 15 hundredweight,
and an extra buoyancy in the air-compartments and casks exceeding 50 cubic
feet or 1-j- ton, sufficient to float the boat and upwards of 30 men. The only
difference from the present boats is the substitution, for the present timber,
of angle-iron frames to which pine bulkheads are riveted, so as to form air-
compartments in bow and stern, the sides amidships being filled with 4- to 6
air-casks, and on the bilge and bottom 24 pairs of cork life-buoys, in place of
the zinc tubes and cork-shavings now in use. It has been intimated that
these boats could be built and fitted for 18s. to 20s. per foot.

    As the principal impediment to the improvement of ships' life-boats and

fittings is the increased expense to the shipowner, and the difficulty in obtain-
ing boats and davits efficient and ready when required, it is to be hoped
that some shipbuilders may be induced to build and forge a few such standard

life-boats and davits as may be recommended by the Committee, or that
subscriptions may be raised for the first or experimental boats. 500 copies

of this plan and specification iiave been gratuitously circulated.
STATISTICS OF LIFE-BOATS AND FISHING-BOATS.  329

  --Boats' Davits. As to boats' davits and tackle-blocks, having experienced

loss of boats from the bending of iron davits, and the difficulty of hoisting
boats up in sea-way, in 1835, the vcriter was induced to alter the curve and
form of the iron davits, and to adopt large threefold blocks with swivel
hooks, which resulted in greater security to the boats and much facility in
lowering and recovering them at sea ; and with reference to the before-men-
tioned right-angle and round form of davits, and small blocks now in use,
the expediency of exhibiting an improved construction of both is suggested.

    As to davits, it is proposed to increase the strength with reduced weight,
by giving a less acute angle to the curve, and, by increasing the width of the
davit in the direction of the curve, to double the diameter of the round part
at the clamp or rail. Or from the rail upwards the davit may be converted
from double-headed railway-bars, the thick parts of railway-bar, forming the

--top and bottom of the davit along the curve, to be welded together at the

upper end, to hang the tackle block, also to carry a roller, over which a
single pennant will run, so as to lower the boat by single ropes from the
ship when under way, the end of the rope running through one roller
freeing the boat from the ship. This is a modification of Guthrie's plan
already adopted in the Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamers, being
lowered by two men on board the ship, and in opposition to Mr. Clifford's
plan of one man in the centre of the boat lowering her by two ropes through
four sheaves, one in the bottom of the boat.

    As to blocks, it is proposed to use large threefold wooden blocks with
iron inside straps, the upper block to have a swivel-hook, the lower block
to have a hook hung on a pin connecting the inside straps of the block,
so that the hook can be disengaged from the sling without turning the

block.

   Mr. Ewing, of Birkenhead, has made a model of this block, which is
exhibited, and may be inspected at the Mercantile Marine Association
Rooms, 20 Water Street, Liverpool, where any suggestions for the further-
ance of the formation of a Ship's Life-boat and Fittings Committee will be

thankfully received.

   There are also models and plans of boats' davits, slings, valves, and life-
boat fittings, submitted for the consideration of the Members of the Asso-

ciation.

In opening the proceedings of this Section of the Association, I hope a few minutes
of your time, precious though it be, will not be misemployed in pointing out to

those of you who have not specially devoted yourselves to its pursuits their para-

mount importance. Its highest department, mathematical science, is the noblest,
the most nearly approaching to what we may suppose to be the kind of knowledge
possessed by beings of an order superior to our own, which man can attain. By
it alone we reach that which is the great aim of the good and wise, absolute truth.
All the rest of our knowledge is only probable, varying in degree from the verge of
certainty down to mere shadowy conjecture, and trustworthy exactly in proportion
as the intellectual processes which deduce it are trained and used in analogy to its
practice. It is also our mightiest aid in exploring the wide fields of physical and
mechanical science : in the first, without its guiding light, we wander in a region of

--their path. Yet with all its supreme dominion, it can only be attractive to a very few,

and the inferior objects of our Section as Optics, Electricity, Magnetism, Meteoro-

--logy, and the like will always be more popular. It were an evil hour for the human

race in which it should sink into a secondary place : we have always upheld it, as I
trust we always shall do, as our guiding banner. But even for the others we have
not laboured in vain, as was so well shown last night by our accomplished President.
His words carried me back to the time when, twenty-two years ago, we met in this
city for the first time ; and reminded me of the important researches which were
originatedatthatmeeting, andof the success with which they were carried out. Some

--of them I shall name as evidence of what the British Association has done for science.

To begin with my own special pursuits. 1 . There had been made at Greenwich during

the preceding century a vast series of solar, lunar, and planetary observations, match-

less in the world, of the highest importance to perfect the planetary theory, but quite

useless, because unreduced. How troublesome that work is, none know but they who

have used it; and it would, perhaps, never have been performed but that we obtained it

--from Government. It has been perfectly accomplished under the direction of Mr. Airy.
    2. There existed a collection of star observations, the 'HistoireCeleste,'the proudest

distinction of the two Lalandes, comprising 50,000 stars, all, however, unreduced and
nearly useless. These we have reduced ; and at a large pecuniary outlay, we have given

the investigations, and supplied funds for those discussions of tidal phenomena by

which Dr. Whewell has not only thrown light on a most difficult portion of hydrody-

--namics, but given precious aid to the practical navigator. 5. Two years before that

meeting, a great physicist had declared that to improve by theory the form of ships

was as hopeless as to get the equation of a breaker ; at that meeting a young man, then
unknown, produced the germ of those researches, which, extended under our auspices,

and largely aided by our pecuniary grants, have given J. Scott Russell a world-wide

fame, and made possible the construction of those noble ships which, during the last

month, have borne from your bay, at a speed twice what was once thought attain-

--able, their freight of heroes, to uphold our nation's power, to avenge our slaughtered

countrymen. 6. Lastly, we set on foot that system of magnetic observation of

which you heard last night, which has added so much to our knowledge of terres-

trial magnetism ; nay, which has gone beyond our globe and opened a new range

for inquiry, by showing us that this wondrous agent has power in other parts of the

solar system. Is not this a list of achievements on which those of us who were
then present may look with just pride? May we not venture to hope that when,

in the next of its cycles, the Association shall return to this city, those who may

survive to witness that event shall have it in their power to record one yet more

brilliant ? I cannot expect to be of the number, but the recollection that I have,

however slightly, been a partaker in those labours in which the Association has

worked so well to increase the knowledge and happiness of mankind, and the anti-

cipation that it will continue to advance in the paths of the purest and highest wis-

dom, will cheer the remnant of my appointed time. For that advance we must

prepare the way, and an occasion seems to offer now. The combined series of mag-

netic observations to which I have referred has just closed; and I cannot doubt that

it is our duty to seek for its continuance and extension on a scale commensurate to

the enlarged views which it has already opened. I shall therefore soon seek to

obtain your concurrence in a recommendation to this effect, and am confident that

we shall open a path to a series of new discoveries as much surpassing those which

we have commemorated, as our present experience of the mode of making these

researches transcends the imperfect methods with which they were commenced. I

shall detain you no longer from your work. To mark our sense of the incalculable

importance of pure mathematics, we always endeavour to devote to it the first days

of our week. I cannot, therefore, promise anything attractive, or even intelligible

to all of you ; but Monday will be given to Meteorology, and Tuesday to Optics,
Electricity and Magnetism, which I hope may prove of more general interest.

       0» the Theory of Astronomical Observations, and on some related
                    Questions. By Professor Boole, F.H.S.

   The author gave a short resume of Gauss's theory of the value of astronomical
and other observations, and the method of least squares. He then showed that the
common mode of taking means depended on a theorem, which was only one case of
a much more general theorem in probabilities which he had arrived at, and which he
explained in full to the Section, with the formulae, which he wrote on the board.

He showed that it is only where each of the observations is equally trustworthy that
our common mode of taking means can lead to correct results ; and then showed

that the same theorem furnished the principle for estimating the dependence to be
placed on testimony and other kindred questions.

   The author stated that this calculus was entirely distinct from that of quaternions,
and in it none of the roots concerned were imaginary. He then explained the lead-
ing features of the new calculus, and exemplified its use by an amusing game, which

--he called the Icosian, and which he had been led to invent by it, a lithograph of

which he distributed through the Section, and examples of what the game proposed
to be accomplished were lithographed in the margin, the solutions being shown to
be exemplifications of the calculus. The figure was the projection on a plane of the
regular pentagonal dodecahedron, and at each of the angles were holes for receiving
the ivory pins with which the game was played.

    On the Origin and Elimination of Euclid's " Reductio ad absurdum."
               By John Pope Hennessy, of the Inner Temple.

   The author first pointed out the difl^erence between direct and indirect demonstra-
tion. The enunciation of every geometrical theorem is a conclusion. This conclu-
sion may be proved in either of two ways : (1) either by the simple syllogistic method,
or (2) by a combination of that method with the principle of opposition. Mr. Hen-
nessy showed that every proposition which Euchd proves directly belongs to the first,
and that every proposition proved indirectly belongs to the second class. The origin
of the Reductio ad absurdum was thus resolved into the question, why the principle
of logical opposition should be employed in some cases and not in others. He showed
that the necessity for calling in the aid of logical opposition depended on two abnor-
mal conditions : (1) when any of the premises of an affirmative proposition are nega-
tive, and (2) when none of the premises of a negative proposition are negative. He
then adverted to the number of indirect demonstrations which Euclid had left in the
first six books of the ' Elements,' and to the very small number of these which suc-
ceeding geometers had altered. He concluded by submitting direct proofs of every
proposition hitherto proved indirectly.

   On some General Propositions connected with the Theory of Attractions.
               By the Rev. Professor Jellett, M.A., M.R.I.A.

   The author showed that the attraction of a body whose particles act with a force
varying inversely as any odd power of the distances, may be easily deduced from that of
a body having the same form and quantity of matter, the law of attraction being the
inverse ^rs? power of the distance. He showed further, that while a knowledge of
the attraction of a body whose particles act according to the law of nature, that is
to say, the inverse square of the distance, gives us no information as to any other
law (at least in this method), the knowledge of the attraction for the inverse fourth
power gives it for every higher inverse power.

   From these theorems he proved that there is no law of force capable of being
represented by a series of inverse powers of the distance, except the law of nature,
for which a body will attract as if ils mass were concentrated at a fixed point.

   He showed also that there is no law of force capable of being represented by a

finite series of inverse powers of the distance, except the law of nature, for which a
shell of any form will exercise no attraction on a point within it. If then the

particles of the electrical fluid acted on each other according to any such law,
except that of nature, free electricity, instead of residing as it does entirely on the
surface, would be dispersed through the entire of the changed body.

   These theorems have been hitherto (so far as the author is aware) known only for

a spherical surface.
    After alluding to a well-known theorem of Chasles, he stated as a generalization,

that if any two bodies have one external equilibrium surface common, then attrac-
tion at any point of external space will be in the same direction, and proportional to
the masses of the bodies, the law of force being that of nature.

On certaiji Properties of the Radii of Curvature of Curves and Surfaces,
   and their Application to the Method of Polar Reciprocation. JBy T.
    Martin, J.^., T.C.D.

    The author drew the attention of the Association to certain equations connecting
the principal radii of curvature of a surface and its ])olar reciprocal at corresponding
points, and of their inverse surfaces, and deduced the analogous equations for curves.

   He then pointed out the peculiar power of these equations in transforming theorems

of quantity, which he illustrated by selecting some of the most familiar properties of
curves and surfaces of the second order, thereby with facility and despatch arriving
at some novel and elegant conclusions.

  Om the Centring of the Lenses of the Compound Object- Glasses of Micro-
      scopes. By Sir David Brewster, K.H., LLJ)., F.R.S. L. &,- E.

  --The author said, In studying the subject of diffraction, as observed through the

 microscope, I was led to believe that in the best object-glasses now made the axes of
 the individual lenses are not coincident. I have no means of learning by what process
 the optician centres his lenses and groups of lenses, but it must be a very delicate
 one, when we consider the small size of the lenses, and the great depth of their
 curves ; and I have no doubt that, however imperfect, it is one which is anxiously
 and carefully applied. You are, no doubt, acquainted with Dr. WoUaston's

 interesting paper, "On the Concentric Adjustment of a Triple Object-Glass" (Phil.

 Trans., 1822, p. 32), 45 inches in focal length, executed by the celebrated John
 Dollond, and regarded as one of his best works. By a process which he has
 described. Dr. Wollaston found that it was very imperfectly centred ; and, con-
 trary to the advice of his friends hv2 separated the lenses, and by applying two pairs
 of adjusting screws to the edges of each lens, he placed their axes in the same line,
 and to use his own words, "he restored his object-glass to such correct per-
 formance," that it was " capable of either separating very small and nearly equal
 stars, as those of 44 Bootis and o- Coronse, or of exhibiting the minute secondaries
 of /3 Orionis and 24 Aquilne, with as much distinctness as the state of the air would
 admit." Dr. Wollaston adds, "that the actual limit to its powers cannot be fully
 ascertained, excepting under such favourable conditions of the atmosphere as do but
  rarely occur." If such a distinguished artist as Dollond failed in centring a group
  of three lenses, about 4 inches in diameter, and with comparatively flat curves,
 how much more difficult must it be to centre the six minute lenses of an achromatic
 object-glass one-eighth or one-twelfth of an inch in focal length ; and if such

results were obtained by the correction of his error, how superior must the micro-

scope be in which the concentric adjustment of its lenses is effected ! While

opticians, indeed, confine themselves to the use of only two kinds of glass, of

different refractive and dispersive powers, we can hardly expect much improvement

in the microscope, unless by the substitution of achromatic lenses in the eye-piece,

and by an infallible method of centring each lens, and each group of lenses, in the

instrument. The successful application of two pairs of adjusting screws to each of

six lenses, and also to those of the eye-piece, may be a difBcult task, but it is not

beyond the powers of mechanism. It is very obvious that Dr. Wollaston's method

of examining the centring of a triple object-glass is wholly inapplicable to the

object-glass of a microscope. In submitting to examination an object-glass made

by a distinguished optician, it was necessary to use a microscopic picture of the sun,

and to examine the position of its images as reflected from the various surfaces of

the lenses by means of a microscope, the object-glass of which was brought in

contact with the outer lens of the object-glass to be examined. By separating the

two object-glasses, I observed in succession a series of twenty-four images appearing

and disappearing in succession. These images occupied different parts of the field,

and I could not succeed by the most careful adjustment of the apparatus employed

in placing them in the same axis. These images had various sizes, and were in

various states of colour, some highly coloured, and some purely white. They had

also various sizes, many with fine planetary discs, of different magnitudes ; some

like the smallest fixed stars which it was difficult to descry, and almost all of them

exhibiting the most beautiful concentric diffracted rings when put out of focus.

Two or three images often appeared in the same part of the field, in immediate suc-

cession, while similar pairs arose at a distance from each other. Although I often

succeeded in uniting two or more of these images, yet the effect of this was to place

others at a greater distance ; and I had no hesitation in coming to the conclusion,

that the lenses of the object-glass which produced these images were imperfectly

centred. Having had occasion to see at the Paris Exposition, and more recently

at Florence, the superior performance of Prof. Amici's microscopes, I cannot omit

the present opportunity of urging philosophers and opticians, as I have often done,

to correct the colours of the secondary spectrum by fluids or solids of different

dispersive powers. Prof. Amici has done this. In his object-glasses, Nos. 1 and 2,
of low powers, he employs five different refractive and dispersive substances. In

his  powers Nos. 3, 4, and  5,  he  employs  five such  substances                                            and in his highest
                                                                                                           ;

power. No. 6, he employs six. In recommending, as I have often had occasion to

do, the employment of diamond and other gems in the construction of compound as

well as simple microscopes, I have been met with the objection that they are too

expensive for such a purpose, and they certainly are for instruments intended merely

to instruct and amuse ; but if we desire to make great discoveries, to unfold secrets
yet hid in the cells of plants and animals, we must not grudge even a few diamonds to

reveal them. If Mr. Cooper and Sir James South have given a couple of thousand

pounds for a refracting telescope, in order to study what have been miscalled

"dots" and "lumps" of light on the sky; and if Lord Rosse has expended far
greater sums on a reflecting telescope for analysing what have been called " sparks
of mud and vapour" encumbering the azure purity of the heavens, why should not

other philosophers open their purse, if they have one, and other noblemen sacrifice

--some of their household jewels to resolve the microscopic structures of our own

real world; to unravel mysteries most interesting toman; and disclose secrets
which the Almighty must have intended that we should know ?

  On a new Polarizer, resulting from a Modification of the Prism of Nicol.
                           By M. Leon Foucault, Paris.

   When it is proposed to polarize in a complete manner a pencil of white light, the

best means is to recur to the prism of Nicol ; but if a pencil of a certain volume is

-- --to be acted on, from four to five centimetres diameter, for example, Nicol's prism

becomes expensive and difficult to realize, on account of the scarcity of the beautiful
specimens of the spar of Iceland. The cut adopted for the construction of the
prism of Nicol entails necessarily a great cost of material. To have the prism entire.
--6 REPORT 1857.

a crystal of spar is required, whose longitudinal ridges are at least equal to three
times one of the equal sides which terminate the bases. The piece is then cut from
angle to obtuse angle by an inclined plane of 38^ on the plane of their bases, and
perpendicular to that of their smaller diagonals. The two surfaces thus obtained are
polished and glued together with balsam of Canada, when a parallelopiped thus

prepared is placed on a bottom uniformly lighted. On looking through the piece, a

--field of polarization is seen contained between two curved bauds, one red, the
--other blue, which correspond with the direction of the limits according to which

 the ordinary and extraordinary ray are transmitted. These bands comprise an angu-
 lar space of 32°, which makes Nicol's prism an analyser, applicable in all cases
 where the inclination of the ray, which it is desired to observe simultaneously,
 does not exceed 32°. But this angular extent of the field of polarization, which is
  sought for in the prism of Nicol, considered as an analyser, no longer presents the
 same interest when the apparatus is to fulfil the part of a simple polarizer; for then the
  action desired to be produced acts only, in general, on a pencil of light nearly
  parallel. So that there will be an advantage, in similar circumstances, in increasing
 the extent of the transverse dimension of the prism, even when the consequence
  would be a certain reduction in the extent of the angular field of polarization. Re-
  flecting on the data of the question, I have in effect discovered, that we can modify
  the prism of Nicol in its cut, so as to diminish considerably the length without in-
  jury to its character of polarizer. I take then a parallelopiped of spar, whose longi-

  tudinal ridges equal only five quarters of one of the sides of the base. An inclined
  section of 59° on the plane of the bases, and the new surfaces, being polished, I put

  the two pieces in their natural position without fastening them, taking care to pre-
  serve between the new surfaces a little space, where the air penetrates, and which,

 --with the proper incidence, determines the entire reflexion of the ordinary ray. Look-

  ing through a rhomb thus prepared in other respects mounted like a prism of Nicol

 -- there is still discovered an angular field of polarization ; but the index of refrac-

   tion of air being considerably below those of the two rays propagated by the spar,
   complete polarization only takes place in an extent of 8°, and the field it presents is
   found comprised between two red bands. The new combination then does not
   fulfil the conditions necessary to the formation of a good analyser ; but when it is
   only required to polarize a pencil of solar light, whose extreme rays have an incli-
    nation but of half a degree, the prism, with the thin stratum of air and its eight
   degrees of field, more than suffices to polarize all the elements of such a pencil.
   This kind of polarizer is even in some respects preferable to the prism of Nicol, pro-
    vided that the reflexion of the ordinary ray takes place under an incidence which
    sends it back almost normally to the intersection of its two lateral faces ; this ray
   has no tendency to issue by the base and confound itself, as in Nicol's prism, with
   the extraordinary ray. Also, when the material of spar is very pure, it accom-
    plishes the extinction of the pencil produced by an analyser in a complete manner
    on the whole extent of the transmitted pencil. It is likely that in cases where the
    prism of Nicol is employed as a polarizer, the new form will be preferred, since it
    produces an effect more complete, at the same time economizing nearly two-thirds

    of the mass of spar.

                       On a Telescope Speculum of Silvered Glass.
                              By M. Leon Foucault, Paris.

       The astronomical refractor, compared with the reflecting telescope of the same
    dimensions, has always had the advantage of giving more light ; the pencil of rays
    which fall on the object-glass passes through it for the most part, and is employed
     almost entirely in the formation of the image at the focus ; while on the metal
     mirror a part only of the light is reflected in a converging pencil, which loses still
    more by a second reflexion being brought back towards the observer. However, as
     the reflecting telescope is essentially free from aberration of refrangibility, as the
     purity of its images depends only on the perfection of a single surface, as with re-

  --gard to focal length it possesses a greater diameter than the refracting telescope, and

     thus partly regains the light wasted by reflexions some observers continue to give
     it the preference, chiefly in England, over the refracting telescope for the examina-

tion of celestial objects. It is certain that at this moment, and despite the multi-

plied improvements in the manufacture of large glasses, the most powerful instru-

ment directed towards the heavens is a telescope with a metal speculum. The tele-

scope of Lord Rosse is 6 feet English in diameter, and its focal distance is 55 feet.

Possibly the reflecting instruments would have gained the superiority, could the

--metal take as durable a polish could it be as well worked as the glass, and were

it not heavier. Placing thus in paralleUsm the two sorts of instruments, and dis-

cussing their respective qualities and defects, I finished by conceiving that the tele-

scope with a glass would possess every advantage, if the mirror being once shaped

and polished we could communicate to it the metallic brilliancy, in order to obtain

from it images as luminous as those of the refracting telescopes. This thought,

which at first appeared a fiction of imagination, was soon converted into a satisfac-

tory realit}'. The glass being cut by an experienced optician, and thoroughly

polished, is ready to be covered by Drayton's process with a very thin uniform coat-

ing of silver. This metallic coating, which when taken out of the bath in which it

is formed is dull and dark, is easily brightened by rubbing with a skin lightly tinged

wth oxide of iron, and acquires in a short time a very brilliant lustre. By this

operation the surface of the glass is wholly of metal, and becomes vividly reflective,
not exhibiting under severest tests the slightest alteration in form. To procure a

disc of glass with concave surface perfectly finished, I applied to Mr. Secretan, who
had the kindness to provide for me a clever workman. On the other hand, to be

able to obtain a deposit of silver, I had recourse to the owners of the English patent,

M. Power and M. Robert, who actually work the process in France, and who fur-

nished me with the silvery solution, giving at the same time the fullest instructions

Myhow I might best succfeed.  mirror being silvered, and having acquired a

polish of steel, I formed a telescope of it of ten centimetres diameter and fifty cen-

timetres focal length. This little instrument supports well the eye-glass, which

magnifies 200 times, and compared with the reflecting telescope of one metre, gives

a very sensibly superior effect. Wishing to learn the proportion of light usefully

reflected by the layer of silver deposited on the glass, and afterwards polished, or,

at least, to compare the intensity of a pencil of rays reflected by a surface thus pre-

pared with that of one transmitted by an equal surface from the object-glass of a

refracting telescope, I accomplished the matter without difficulty by means of a

photometer with divisions, which I had employed on another occasion. The result

of this operation ensures a decided advantage to the new telescope. The pencil of

rays reflected on the silvered glass is equal to 90 per cent, of those transmitted

through an object-glass of four partial reflexions ; so that the new instrument avails

itself of the overplus of light, which, on account of the greater diameter of the mir-

ror, concurs efficiently to the formation of the focal image. Diameters equal, the

telescope with glass is by one-half shorter than the other instrument ; with equal

lengths, it bears a double diameter, and collects three and a half times more light.
Considered in another point of view, the new combination is distinguished in this,

that it produces all its efi"ect without the concurrence of those numerous conditions

required to obtain a certain degree of perfection in any telescope, whether reflect-

ing or refracting. The achromatic telescope, above all, requires that the con-

structor of it, at one and the same time, pay particular attention to the homoge-

neity of the two sorts of glass which form the object-glass, their refracting and di-

spersive powers, the combination of curves, the centring and the execution of four

spherical surfaces. In the new telescope, on the contrary', the glass, serving not as

a middle refractor, but only to support a verj' thin layer of metal, the homogeneity

of the mass is by no means required, and the most ordinary glass of suflScient thick-

ness worked with care afl^ords a concave surface, which when silvered and polished

furnishes of itself and by reflexion excellent images. There is one strong objection

--to the metal mirrors, it is, that they become oxidized in time, and are tarnished

by contact with the air. Eight months I have kept silvered mirrors, which have not

yet undergone any sensible alteration. Will they preserve this state of perfection a

still longer time ? The experiment has not been sufficiently prolonged to decide one

way or the other ; but even should the lustre of the mirror become weaker, there

is no difficulty in recurring to the same means for re-establishing it, by which it

had been at first obtained. In fine, should the depth of the silver be altered, the

operation of depositing it is so easy and prompt, that it can easily be repeated. To
resume, the new instrument, compared with the refracting telescopes, gives, at much
less cost, more light, more distinctness, and is free, like the reflecting telescope, from

all aberration of refrangibility.

On the Colour of Sahs in Solution, each Constituent of tohich is coloured.
                     ^ Bt/ J.U. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.E.S.

   It is a general law, that " all the compounds of a particular base or acid, when in
aqueous solution, absorb the same rays of light ; " hence it may be deduced, that
when a coloured base and a coloured acid combine, the resulting salt will transmit

only those rays which are not absorbed by either constituent, or in other words,

only those rays which are transmitted by both. This was proved to be actually the

case by a prismatic examination of compounds of chromic, permanganic, and car-

bazotic acids with copper, iron, nickel, uranium, and chromium. Though the

compounds of chlorine, bromine, and iodine with hydrogen and most metals are
colourless, the compounds of these halogens with gold, platinum, and palladium

exhibit an absorption of light due to the halogen as well as that due to the metal.

The same is true in respect to chlorides, bromides, and iodides of copper, iron,
nickel, and cobalt, when these salts are dissolved in a minimum of water ; but
when more water is added, the colour changes, and the absorption due to the halogen
no longer exists. In one or two of the cases examined a slight variation from the

general law occurred ; and ferrocyanide of iron forms a complete exception. The
double chloride of platinum and copper shows the absorbent eflect of all three

constituents.             ^_____

          On the Effects of Heat on the Colour of Dissolved Salts.
                   By J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.R.S.

If a coloured salt be dissolved in water, heating the solution does not usually

affect the colour of it. In not a few cases, however, the colour is rendered more

intense, and altered somewhat in its character. Among the examples mentioned

were ferridcyanide of potassium, meconate of iron, chloride and bromide of palla-

dium. In other cases, heating the solution produces apparently a total change of

colour :  for  instance,  chloride of copper  passes when  heated  from blue to  green
                                                                                                         ;

chloride of nickel from a bluish to a yellowish green; sulphocyanide of cobalt, or

chloride of cobalt dissolved in aqueous alcohol, from a pale red to a deep bluish

purple. In all these instances heat causes the absorption of a larger quantity of
rays by the solution ; but this appears to depend sometimes upon some purely

physical cause, at other times upon some chemical change. With ferridcyanide of

potassium, and similar salts, a certain thickness of the heated solution produces

precisely the same effect on the spectrum as an increased thickness of the same
solution when cold. With chloride of copper, and similar salts, the somewhat

--dilute solution when heated produces the same effect on the spectrum as the same

solution when concentrated and cold, these salts being all of that character which

is altered in colour by the addition of water.

    On Improvements in the Optical Details of Reflecting Telescopes and
     Equatoreal Instnanents. By Thomas Grube, M.R.I.A., Dublin.

   The author stated, that while the Earl of Rosse, by his achievements, had placed
beyond doubt the practicability of producing specula for reflecting telescopes at
once as perfect as could be desired, and as large as could be made practically useful,
the achromatic object-glass had received but little increment of size ; and though
the Messrs. Chance, of Birmingham, had produced a pair of discs, of optical glass,
of 29 inches diameter, yet these had been allowed to be transferred to another
country, where the work of forming them into an object-glass was still to be effected.
Four years had now elapsed since the production of these discs, and the refracting
telescope may now be considered as being completely distanced in size by its com-
petitor, the reflector. Under such circumstances, it was important, he conceived.

 to give to the reflecting telescope every possible accession of improvement which the
 progress of art or science placed from time to time at our disposal. The two points

 of admitted inferiority of the reflector being, a greater liability to tarnish than glass,
 and less intrinsic brilliancy of the reflected pencil of light ; the author had suc-
 ceeded (so far as the small specul'im of the reflecting telescope is concerned) in

 entirely obviating the former objection, and in very much lessening the other. Regard-
 less of the failure of an attempt, made years since, to construct a reflecting telescope
 of glass surfaces quicksilvered, he concluded, from his own experience, that such
 surfaces could be made equally perfect with those of speculum metal; while by

 silvering (not quicksilvering) that surface required to reflect, a great increase of light
 would result, thus producing for the small reflector of the telescope a mirror as
 imperishable as glass, and, in reflecting power, approaching the transmitting power

 of a lens. The author explained why, instead of using this reflector in its simplest
 form, viz. that of a lens of equal thickness silvered on one side, he preferred an
 achromatized compound of two lenses, cemented and silvered, and exhibited such a
compound, which, he stated, had on trial performed perfectly. He next proceeded
 to describe in detail his proposed application of the same principles to both small
 and large specula of telescopes (where such were of moderate dimensions), as also
an improved form of the prism of total reflexion applicable to Newtonian telescopes
of the largest dimensions. This latter is a prism of divergent or concave power made
aplanatic, or at least achromatized, reducing the convergence of the rays coming
from the large speculum, and also the size required for the pi ism in the same arbi-

trary proportion (two or three times being suggested) ; the required magnifying
power being obtained by a proportionally lower eye-piece. The author next pro-
ceeded to discuss the respective merits of the several varieties of equatoreal mounting
as applicable to large telescopes. The first variety, or long polar axis (biforked or
not), he rejects from its necessarily great length and consequent unsteadiness. The
second, or large-cone polar axis, supporting the telescope in a bifurcation prolonged

--beyond the upper bearing, he would also reject, from the enormous weight of such

in proportion to the telescope carried, 4 tons being stated as the moving mass
in the case of a telescope of only 8 inches diameter. The third, or German
variety of construction, the author considers, in its general type, as preferable to all

others ; and he has therefore devoted much attention to its improvement. By a

system of internal counterpoise, he has reduced the direction of the pressure of the
declination axis (with its appendages, including the telescope and its counterpoise)
to that of the centre of revolution of the polar axis, removed all end pressure of the
declination axis, and supported all but a small fraction of these weights by anti-
friction rollers. In this arrangement great steadiness is retained and freedom of

motion attained. An instrument combining these principles and carrying a 12-inch

achromatic of 20 feet focus, has but about 12 cwt. of material (including the tele-
scope) to be moved ; and this is effected by a force of about 1 lb. applied at the eye
end. This instrument, contrasted with the 8 -inch before mentioned, is (allowing
for the difi^erence in size) lighter in the proportion of about hundredweights to tons.
The author, in conclusion, and aided by drawings, explained the general construction
of an instrument of the German type which he had devised purposely for the pro-
posed great southern telescope, and which construction had been selected by the
Committee appointed by the British Association in reference to the same. In this
instrument a telescope of the proposed diameter (viz. 4 feet), and the other moving
portions of the instrument, are calculated at 19,000 lbs., moved by a force of 20 lbs.,
applied at a radius of 5 feet ; the other proposed construction, which was that of
the prolonged polar axis, being estimated at 45,000 lbs. moving weight, and requiring

750 lbs., or 37^ times that of the author's construction for its movement.

On a Method of determining whether the Luminiferous Vibrations are Parallel

quantity of light reflected from the surface of metals. Going even still further,

M. Cau'chy calculated this same quantity of light for all the incidences in cases

where the'primitive ray would be supposed to be decomposed into two polar rays at

right angles, the one parallel and the other perpendicular to the plane of incidence.

   This being settled, the following is the mode of reasoning, by which, we believe,
all doubt maybe removed as to the truth of the hypothesis which supposes that the
luminous vibrations are perpendicular to the plane of polarization, and as to the

falsity of that according to which the vibrations are parallel to this plane.

   I. Of the two rays polcirized at right angles, which we have hitherto considered,

one has its vibrations parallel, and the other has them.'perpendicular to the plane of
incidence and to the indication of this plane upon the plane of reflexion.

   If we ask ourselves which of them must be least extinguished in the act of re-
flexion, which, when reflected must exhibit the greatest intensity, we shall answer

without hesitation, that of which the vibrations are parallel to the plane of the re-
flecting surface, as it penetrates less into the metallic medium, and undergoes less of

its influence. On the other hand, M. Cauchy has proved that the ray li, polarized

in a direction parallel to the plane of incidence, is that which is most reflected

consequently it is for this ray li that the vibrations are parallel to the reflecting

surface, or to the plane of reflexion ; but vibrations parallel to the reflecting surface

are at the same time vibrations perpendicular to the plane of incidence, and conse-
quently perpendicular to the plane of polarization, which for the ray li coincides

with the plane of incidence; therefore for the ray li polarized in the plane of inci-
dence the vibrations are perpendicular to the plane of polarization. If we reasoned
upon the ray Ip, we should also say that it is the ray which is reflected with the
least intensity, therefore it is that of which the vibrations are oblique to the reflect-

--ing surface, and at the same time perpendicular to the indication of the plane of

incidence, therefore, for the ray polarized perpendicularly to the plane of inci-
dence, the vibrations are parallel to that plane, or perpendicular to the plane of

polarization.

   II. Of the two rays polarized at right angles, one is of such a nature, that as the
incidence increases, the intensity after reflexion remains very nearly constant, and
increases very little in proportion as the incidence increases ; the other, on the con-
trary, is such, that its intensity after reflexion goes on diminishing more and more.
Now'is it not evident that the ray which must sensibly retain the same intensity

after reflexion, is the ray of which the vibrations are parallel to the plane of reflexion ;
that, on the contrary, the ray which becomes extinguished by degrees when the in-

cidence increases, is the one whose vibrations are in the plane of incidence, perpen-

dicular to the direction of propagation, and to the intersection of the planes of in-

cidence and reflexion ; since these vibrations, being at first parallel to the plane of
reflexion, erect themselves by degrees when the incidence increases, and form with the
plane of reflexion an angle which becomes larger and larger, until they become per-

pendicular under the incidence of 90° ? Now from the formulae of M. Cauchy, the

reflected ray of which the intensity is perceptibly constant, and increases slowly in

proportion aa the incidence increases, is the ray It ; therefore it is for this ray that
               TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                11

the vibrations are parallel to the plane of reflexion, and perpendicular to the plane

of incidence, and consequently to the plane of polarization, which for this ray li co-
incides with the plane of incidence. According to M. Cauchy, also, the ray which

is gradually extinguished in proportion as the incidence increases, is the ray Ip ; there-

fore it is for this ray that the vibrations, always perpendicular to the direction of pro-

pagation and to the intersection of the planes of incidence and reflexion, are in the

plane of incidence, and consequently perpendicular to the plane of polarization,

which is perpendicular to the plane of incidence. Therefore in all cases the luminous

vibrations are perpendicular to the plane of polarization.

   Mr. Stokes has raised an objection to this demonstration, which appears to us

to fail. He says that M. Cauchy has deduced his numbers from a theory which

assumes as its starting-point, the hypothesis that the vibrations are perpendicular

to the plane of polarization ; but there is nothing to prove that in this case, as in

many others, we do not arrive at the same result by starting from the opposite

Wehypothesis.  do not deny that this may be the case ; but in order that our rea-

soning may subsist in its full extent, it is sufficient that the numbers of M. Cauchy

should be considered as numbers obtained by photometric experiments. Now this

is certainly the case, for these numbers undoubtedly agree with all the known results

of photometric experiments. As soon as they are admitted as natural numbers, no
objections can be raised to our mode of reasoning.

A Mathematical Investigation of the Proportion between the Length required

  for an Electric Telegraph Cable and its Specific Gravity. By Captain

   Blakely.

   The author showed, by the principles of the composition of motion, as a telegraph
wire was paid out from a ship, the velocity which gravity would give it would soon
become uniform by the resistance of the water as its parts descended ; therefore, the
descending part of the cable from the advancing ship to the part of the cable which
had reached and was supported upon the bottom, and which he showed in very deep
water, say two miles or more, might stretch back six or more miles from the ship.
Now, unless a great strain were kept on the brake in the ship where the cable was
paying out, a strain, which in the case of the Atlantic cable had caused it to part, it
was obvious from this demonstration that there must always be what the sailor
termed " slack" in the cable when it reached and lay on the bottom, for the incUned
length of the rope was always longer than the horizontal length of the bottom on
which it was intended to lie. The author then proceeded to estimate, by mathema-
tical formulae, and numerically, the exact proportion of these in several supposed
depths of soundings, rapidity of paying out, and specific gravity of the cable ; and
came to the conclusion, that the only way of lessening an evil, which must never be
expected to be entirely got rid of, was by increasing the speed of the vessel paying
out the cable, and diminishing the specific gravity of the cable itself, so that it should

sink gently to its final position.

                      On the Electro-dynamic Induction Machine.

             By the Rev. Professor Call an, of Maynooth College.

    After stating that he had discovered the induction coil in 1836, that in 1837 he had
devised an instrument for getting a rapid succession of electrical currents from the
coil, and that thus he had completed the coil in 1837, as a machine by which a regular
supply of electricity might be furnished, the author said that he would lay before
the Association the results of a long series of experiments on the induction machine.
The first of these results is a means of getting a shock directly from the armature of
a magnet at the moment of its demagnetization, by using, not a solid piece of iron.
12 REPORT-- 1857.

but a coil of very fine insulated iron for the armature of an electro-magnet, between

the poles of which the coil would fit. When the helix of the magnet is connected

with a battery, the armature is magnetized on account of its proximity to the mag-

netized iron ; and when the battery connexion is broken, if the ends of the insulated
iron wire be held in the hands, a shock will be felt. The second result is the dis-

covery of the fact, that if iron wires be put into a coil of covered copper wire, the

ends of which are connected with a battery, and if another coil be connected with

the same battery, the quantity of electricity which will flow through the latter will
be greater (vhen the first coil is filled with iron wires than when they are removed.

The third result is, a core for the primary coil, which consists of a coil of insulated

iron wire, and which has five advantages over all the cores in common use. First,

there is no complete circuit for any electrical current excited in any section of the

core, because all the spirals of the coil are insulated from each other, and no spiral

returns to itself. In the common cores, even when the wires are covered with

thread, there is a complete circuit for every current induced in each section of every

wire. Secondly, the currents in the various sections of the iron coil do not oppose each,

other ; but the currents in each section of every wire of the common cores are opposed

by the currents flowing in the surrounding wires. Thirdly, in the iron coil all the cur-

rents in the various spirals flow in the same direction, and form one strong current,

which may be used by connecting the ends of the coil with any body to which we wish

to applvits force. But in the common cores all the currents in the sections of each

wire remain within the wires, and cannot be used. Fourthly, the effect of the condenser

on the currents produced in the iron core can be ascertained when an iron coil is
used, but not with the common cores. By using an iron coil as a core, it is found

that the condenser increases the intensity of the currents induced in the core.

Fifthly, the ends of the iron coil, used as a core, may be connected with the coatings

of a Leyden jar, and then the sparks from the coil are diminished in length, but in-

creased in brightness. By the use of cores consisting of coils of insulated iron
wires, electrical currents of considerable quantity and intensity may be obtained.
These currents of quantity and intensity may answer for working the Atlantic tele-

graph, and for producing the electric light. Besides the cores just described, and

the common  core.  Prof.  Callan  used  three  other  kinds  of cores                                       viz. a flat or ellip-
                                                                                                         ;

tical bundle of wires ; a core made by coiling uninsulated iron wire on an iron bar,

and a core consisting partly of a bundle of iron wire, and partly of a coil of insulated
iron wire. The fourth result of his experiments is a new mode of insulation, in

which imperfect insulation is used when imperfect insulation is sufficient, and per-

fect insulation is employed where such insulation is required. The advantage of

this mode of insulation is, that each spiral in the secondary coil is brought nearer

to the other spirals, as well as to the primary coil and core, than it can be in the

common method of insulation, without at all diminishing the efficiency of the insu-

Alation.  coil in which the secondary wire was iron, and insulated in the manner

described, was shown to the meeting, which, with a single cell, 6 inches by 4, gave
sparks half an inch long without a condenser. The insulation of the large conden-

sers made by Prof. Callan, in which the acting metallic surface of each plate exceeded
600 square feet, gave way before the coil which he exhibited was made ; and there-
fore he could not say what the length of the sparks would be with the aid of a con-

denser. But were a condenser of the proper size to have the effect of increasing the

sparks in a thirtyfold ratio, as in Mr. Gassiot's great coil, the length of the sparks
produced by Prof. Callan's coil with a single cell should be 15 inches. The outer

diameter of the coil was about 4 inches, its length 20 inches, and the length of the

secondary coil about 21,000 feet. The fifth result is, a contact-breaker in which the
striking parts are copper, and which acts as well as if they were platina. The sixth

result is a more satisfactory explanation of the condenser, which is confirmed by the
effect of the condenser on the electrical currents produced in the core. The last result
consists in the discovery of some new facts relating to the condenser, from some of
which it follows, that the ordinary mode of making the condenser is defective ; for con-

densers are generally made so that the entire surface of each of the metallic plates

must act. But the condenser for every coil should be constructed in such a way, that
a small, or a considerable part, or the whole of the surface of each plate may be
applied to the coil. For a large condenser which would make the effect of a coil ex-

of tke same coil, when it is connected with a battery often or twelve cells.

On controlling the Movements of Ordinary Clocks hy Galvanic Currents.
                      By John Hartnup, F.R.A.S.

Since the application of electricity to the purposes of the telegraph, various

methods have been employed for working clocks at distant stations by a normal

clock at an observatory, or by causing one clock in a large establishment to work

several sympathetic clocks in different parts of the building. The advantage of being

able to make several clocks show the same time as a normal clock regulated by

astronomical observations, or by the transmission of time signals from an observa-

tory, must be admitted to be great ; but those who have had much practical experi-

ence in the matter are aware of the serious drawback which, in spite of every pre-

caution, will occasionally arise from failure in the'galvanic current, and which neces-

Wesarily causes all the sympathetic clocks to stop.  think, therefore, that the

members of the British Association for the Advancement of Science will be gratified

to hear of an invention which sacrifices nothing in point of accuracy, and which is,

nevertheless, perfectly exempt from the objection to which we have alluded.

For the discovery of this simple and very beautiful method, we are indebted to

Mr. R. L. Jones, of Chester ; and the first application of it to a large public clock
was to that of the Liverpool Town Hall. This clock being appealed to by the mer-

chants on change as the standard of time, had subjected them to great incon-

venience by its irregular performance, and at my recommendation the plan of Mr.

Jones has been adopted with perfect success. The clock in its present state, with

the improvements which have been made, differs in no respect from an ordinary' old

turret clock, except that the pendulum-bob is a hollow electro-magnetic coil, which

passes around permanent magnets at each oscillation. At each transmission of a

current from our normal clock at the Observatory, the coil itself becomes a magnet,

and the attraction or repulsion between it and the permanent magnet prevents the

pendulum from oscillating except in strict conformity with the pendulum at the
Observatory. The wire which connects the Town Hall clock with the clock at the

Observatory is about one mile in length, and the controlling power is so great, that a

single cell of a Smee's battery charged with very weak acid is sufficient to control
the movements of the Town Hall clock, even when the pendulum is lengthened or
shortened so as to make it lose or gain several minutes a day when not under the

control of the clock at the Observatory. In practice, however, the pendulum is

regulated to correct time as near as possible, so that in the event of the current

failing, the clock will not only continue to go, but it is liable to the errors only of an

ordinary clock ; and as an error so small even as a fraction of a second is sufficient

to show that the current is not controlling, the fault may be detected and the remedy

applied before the public are subjected to any inconvenience.

   By this method therefore it is quite practicable to make all the public clocks in a
town, or any number of clocks in a large building, strike, or keep the same time to a

fraction of a second, without the risk of inconvenience by failure of the electric

current, since all the clocks would go as ordinary clocks should the current fail.
   This method of controlling the pendulum of a large public clock has been in opera-

tion at Liverpool for several months past, and the public have an opportunity each

hour of the day of witnessing the efficiency of the method. In the office window of

the Magnetic Telegraph Company, which is within a few yards of the Liverpool

Town Hall, there is a sympathetic seconds clock, the face of which is exhibited to

the public.  This clock is worked  by our normal clock at the Observatory                                                                                                                                                   and  as
                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

the seconds' hand, at the end of each hour, falls upon the sixtieth second, the first
blow of the hammer of the Town Hall clock breaks upon the ear, much to the

admiration and astonishment of a large number of persons who congregate daily to

witness this novel performance.

   The normal clock at the Observatory is an ordinary astronomical clock, the con-
tact-springs of which are so slight as not to interfere sensibly with its performance.

It will be seen, therefore, that by placing a good astronomical clock in any build-
ing, a turret or any other clocks may be connected and their movements controlled

by it, and a degree of accuracy secured which has hitherto not been attained.

On the Amount and Frequency of the Magnetic Disturbances and of the
  Aurora at Point Barroiu, on the Shores of the Polar Sea. By Major-

   General Sabine, Treas. R.S.

   Point Barrow is the most northern cape of that part of the American continent
which lies between Behring's Strait and the Mackenzie River. It was the station
of H.M.S. ' Plover' from the summer of 1852 to the summer of 1854, and to Cap-
tain Maguire, now in the Section, and to the officers of that ship, they were indebted

for the very valuable series of observations which he was now about to lay before

the Section, and in part discuss.

   They were furnished with supplies of provisions, &c. for Sir John Franklin's
ships, had they succeeded in making their way through the land-locked and ice-

encumbered channel, through which they sought to effect a passage from the Atlan-

tic to the Pacific. In this most dreary and otherwise uninteresting abode Capt.

Maguire and his officers happily found occupation during seventeen months unre-

mittingly, in observing and recording every hour the variations of the magnetic and

concomitant auroral phenomena, in a locality perhaps one of the most important

on the globe for such investigations. Their observatory, placed on the sand of

the shore, which for a long tract nowhere rose much more than 5 feet above the

sea, was constructed of slabs of ice, and lined with seal-skins throughout. The

instruments had been supplied by the Woolwich establishment, together with the

requisite instructions for their use ; and the observations were made and recorded

precisely in the same manner as those of the Colonial magnetic observatories. These

were sent by Capt. Maguire to the Admiralty, and were in due course transmitted

to General Sabine, by whom they were subjected to the same processes of reduction

as those made in the Colonial observatories.

The author then exhibited to the Section six diagrams, containing the results of

this discussion, giving the reduced observations at each of the hours of the twenty-

Afour.  sufficient body of the larger disturbances having been separated from the

rest, it was found at Point Barrow as elsewhere, wherever similar investigations

had been made, that in regard to the frequency of their occurrence, and the average

amounts of easterly and westerly deflections, the disturbances followed systematic

laws depending on the hours of solar time. The laws of the easterly and westerly

deflections were also found at Point Barrow, as elsewhere, to be distinct and dissi-

milar. The author explained how these observations were separated from the rest,

for the purpose of this investigation. Upon instituting a comparison between the

disturbance laws at Point Barrow and Toronto, it was found that the laws of the

deflections of the same name at the two stations did not correspond ; but, on the

other hand, that there existed a very striking and remarkable correspondence between

the law observed by the easterly at Point Barrow and the westerly at Toronto, and

between the law of the westerly at Point Barrow and easterly at Toronto ; this
correspondence was shown to exist not in slight or occasional particulars only, but

throughout all the hours in well-marked characteristics of both classes of phenomena

and from the correspondence in the hours at which opposite disturbance deflections

prevail, it follows that the portion of the diurnal variation which depends upon the

disturbances has opposite, or nearly opposite, characteristics at the two stations. The

importance of eliminating these disturbances from the regular march of the solar vari-

ation was then pointed out ; for when the diurnal variation is derived from the whole

body of observations at Point Barrow, retaining the disturbances, the westerly ex-

treme of the diurnal excursion, which, as is well known, occurs generally in the

extra-tropical part of the northern hemisphere a little after 1 p.m., is found to take

place at 1 1 p.m. ; but when these larger disturbances are omitted, the westerly extreme
is brought back to the same time as elsewhere, viz. 1 p.m. ; and the author suggested

the probability that the anomalies which have sometimes been supposed to exist in

the turning hours of the solar diurnal variation in high latitudes may be susceptible

of a similar explanation. It appears, then, by a comparison of the Point Barrow

and Toronto observations, that in the regular solar-diurnal variation the progression

at the two stations is similar, the easterly and the westerly extremes being each

reached nearly at the same hours, whilst in the disturbance diurnal variation this

progression is reversed. Another distinction exists in their magnitudes, which are

found in the solar-diurnal variation to be as nearly as may be in the inverse ratio of
the values of the horizontal force at the two stations (which is the antagonistic force
opposing all magnetic variations), whilst on the other hand the increase in the range
of the disturbance variation is many times greater than it would be according to the

same proportion. It would appear, therefore, that the energy of the disturbing

force must be much greater at Point Barrow than at Toronto.
   The author then proceeded to point out the concomitant occurrences of the auroral

manifestations. The observers noted at each hour whether or not there was an
aurora visible: from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. no auroral displays were ever observed;
but the number of them was found progressively to increase from 3 p.m. to 1 a.m.,
and then again in regular progression to decrease to 0, at 11 a.m. The frequency
of the occurrence of the aurora may be judged of, when it is shown that during six

--months, December, January, and February of 1852-58, and the same of 1853-54,
--the aurora was seen six days out of every seven. The hour of the day at which

no auroral display is ever observed corresponds with the minimum of westerly dis-
turbance, while the maximum of both is found at the same hour of westerly dis-
turbance, viz. l.A.M. The frequency of the aurora, also, and the amount of west-

erly deflection of the magnet also accord ; whilst on the other hand, the auroral
hours appear to have little or nothing in common with the turning hours or the pro-

gression of the easterly deflections.

When Sir John Franklin was going out on the expedition which deprived his

country of the invaluable services of himself and his brave companions, he had been

furnished by the Admiralty with instruments carefully adjusted and compared with

standards, and with full instructions for their use, and for the making and recording

hourly magnetic observations in the several stations he might occupy in these seas ;

and in the last letter which had ever been received from him, he had expressed his

determination to put up those instruments at the several stations at which he should

Nowwinter.  when his ardour in these pursuits and that of Captain Crozier, the

second in command, and the other ofiicers, were taken into account, there could

remain no doubt that such observations had been made and recorded, and that these

records may still exist if the ships themselves have not been destroyed. Parties

quitting the ships with the prospect before them of a long and perilous journey to

the Hudson's Bay settlements would not be likely to charge themselves with such
records, but would leave them, well secured, to be found by those who they might
naturally expect would be sent to search for them. He had therefore no doubt that
if the ships of Sir John Franklin were still in existence, the records of more than one
winter's observations would be found in their cabins ; and this was one of the reasons
why men of science were so anxious to have the ships carefully looked for ; it was
a duty to the memories of those who had sacrificed their lives in procuring these
and other valuable results, to have them recovered if possible.

Brief Account of the Construction and Effects of a very Powerful Induction

  ByApparatus, devised by Mr. E. S. Ritchie, of Boston, United Statet,.
  Professor W. B. Rogers.

   In this the secondary coil is formed by winding the wire in such manner as to
make a series of flat spirals, having each the thickness of a single wire, and thus
building up the coil by thin transverse strata. The primary coil is covered by a
gutta-percha tube, and this by a closely fitting bell-glass, knobbed at the upper end,
and having a widely expanded lip below. Over the whole is placed the secondary
coil. By this arrangement the discharge between the core and the secondary coil
is efi"ectually prevented. Very perfect means are used for preventing any discharge
within the secondary coil, between its difi^erent parts. With a secondary coil of
30,000 feet of wire, No. 34, and using one Bunsen cell, this apparatus gives a spark

6 inches in length. When the coil is increased to 50,000 or 60,000 feet, and four

cells are used, the spark is lengthened to upwards of 10 inches, and has been passed
continuously through an interval of lOf inches. The primary coil is formed of
No. 9 wire, and is about 80 feet in length. The condenser, made of tinfoil sepa-
rated by oiled silk, has a surface in this larger apparatus of about 30 feet. Prof.

Rogers referred to the very superb phenonaena produced by the passage of the cur-

by the beautiful arrangement known as Gassiot's Cascade, which, with other pheno-
mena of electrical light, were developed by this apparatus with a splendour perhaps

never before equalled.

Hesearches on the Correlation of Dynamic Electricity and the other Physical

                         Forces. By M. Louis Soket.

                              Introduction.

    Suppose an electric circuit composed, for example, of a voltaic battery, the poles

of which are united by a conductor. Suppose, in the first place, that all parts of
this circuit are sufficiently distant from any other conducting or magnetic body, that

the current cannot exert any exterior action. The facts may then be represented in

the following manner. In the battery, a chemical action, the primary source of force,

is set up. If the two poles be disunited, the chemical action can nevertheless take

place; this production offeree is manifested by heat evolved in the battery itself. If

the poles be united by a conductor, a part of this force is converted into electricity ;
it manifests itself without the battery in the conductor, where it again becomes trans-
formed into heat. According to M. De la Rive and M. Favre, the sum of the quan-
tities of heat disengaged in the battery and in the rest of the circuit, has a constant

value for the same amount of chemical action, a law which is perfectly in accordance
with the principle of the conservation of forces. This quantity of active force, which
is usually manifested in the form of heat, may be called the interior work of the

circuit.

Now suppose the current to act upon bodies external to its own circuit ; we know
that it may produce currents of induction, magnetization, &c., forces which may

themselves be converted either into heat or into mechanical work. This new quan-

tity of active force may be called the exterior work of the circuit.
   If it were to be supposed that nothing was changed in the primary circuit when

it had to exert an exterior action, that the interior v/ork has its value whether or no

the current produces exterior work, this would lead us to admit a creation of force,

and to place ourselves in complete opposition to the fundamental principles of

...mechanics.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ..
   What are the changes into the phenomena produced in the mterior of the circuit

when exterior work is produced ? in other words, how is the conversion of force

then effected ? This is the question, the investigation of which I have set before me.

  We are already aware, principally from the researches of M. Jacobi, that when

mechanical work is produced by means of electricity with the aid of an electro-mag-

netic  machine, the  current  employed diminishes in  intensity                                           with this diminution
                                                                                                       ;

of intensity, a diminution of the heat evolved in the circuit must necessarily cor-

respond. But it appears to me that the explanation is far from being satisfactory.

In fact at the same time that the intensity of the current is weakened, the chemical
action is also weakened ; and according to Faraday's law, which appears to be now

well established, it is admitted that the amount of chemical work produced in the

battery is always proportionate to the intensity of the current. It results from this,

that, as regards the chemical action, we may perfectly assimilate a current whose

intensity is weakened because it produces exterior work, with another current which
Weexerts no exterior action, but of which the intensity is less.                                          may therefore

conceive two circuits, one only producing interior work, the other producing exterior

work in addition, but having both the same intensity, and consequently consuming

the same quantity of zinc in the two batteries to which they owe their origin ; can

we suppose that the interior work will be the same in both circuits ? Evidently not;
Athis again would be to admit a creation of force.
                                                      change, for example, a diminu-

tion in the heat evolved, must supervene, either in the part of the circuit which

exerts the exterior action by induction, or in the battery itself; or else Faraday's

law ceases to be correct in this case.

   I am far from having arrived at the solution of this question ; and for the present

--I must confine myself to the investigation of some of its elements.

First Memoir. On the variations of intensity undergone by the electric current

                     when it produces mechanical worlc.

When an electric current is employed in setting any machine in motion, it under-
                                                      ----

                 TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                17

goes variations of intensity as soon as there is a relative displacement of the parts

of the apparatus which attract or repel each other under the influence of the elec-

tricity. This phenomenon may be explained by the production of currents of induc-

tion in the conductor itself, in which the principal current is propagated. M. Jacobi

has been the first to insist upon this point in different memoirs. The simplicity of

the formulce at which he arrived has been contested by M. Marie Davy (Comptes

Rendus de I'Acad. des Sciences, 1855). I was of course obliged to attend to this

subject, and I shall give a brief summary of the results of this investigation, results

which are for the most part well known or easy to foresee, but which have not per-

haps been exhibited in a sufficiently general manner, and of which all the conse-

quences have not been examined.

 --Part I. The phenomena which are here in question may be summed up in the fol-
--lowing manner: IVhen an electric current causes the attraction of two pieces of an appa-

ratus, if these two pieces, yielding to this attraction, are set in motion, a diminution of the

intensity of the current is observed ; and inversely, whe7i these two pieces which mutu-

ally attract each other are compelled to move in a direction opposed to that which the

attraction tends to give them, we observe an augmentation of the intensity of the current

whilst this movement is being effected. This law appears to flow from the principle

of Lery upon induction. I have verified it experimentally in four principal cases,
in which a movement may be produced by the action of the current. I have also

examined two other cases which do not answer directly to the enunciation of the

law.

Most frequently these variations of intensity cannot be proved by the direct

measurement of the current by means of a galvanometer, for they are too small in

proportion to the total intensity ; it is necessary to have recourse to a more delicate

method, such as that employed by Wheatstone, Svanberg, &c., which has been

sometimes designated by the name of the  method of the galvanic  bridge                                   at  other
                                                                                                    ;

times, especially when permanent magnets entered into the composition of the

apparatus, it was necessary to be satisfied with proving the presence of a current

of induction in a conducting wire suitably arranged.

The four principal cases which I have investigated are the following :

   1. Attraction of a piece of soft iron by an electro-dynamic coil ; each time that
the piece of soft iron penetrates into the interior of the coil, or emerges from it, a

diminution or an augmentation of the current is observed.

2. Attraction of a piece of soft iron by an electro-magnet. The law is easily

verified, even without the employment of the galvanic bridge, if a strong electro-

magnet be used.

   3. Mutual attraction of two coils, of which one can penetrate into the interior of
the other. The variations of intensity are very slight.

4. Rotation of magnets by currents, and of currents by magnets. The intensity

of the current is weaker when the apparatus is in motion under the influence of the
current ; it is stronger when it is forced to take a rotatory movement opposed to

that which it would naturally take. These variations of intensit}', which are very

slight, arise from currents of axial induction, according to the denomination of

M. Matteucci.

The secondary cases, which I have also studied, are,

   5. Attraction of an armature of soft iron by a permanent magnet. If the per-
manent magnet be surrounded by a coil, of which the extremities are in communi-

cation with a galvanometer, the latter shows, at the moment when the armature is
attracted, a current of which the direction is the same as that which would be pro-
duced by a momentary diminution of the magnetism of the magnet. When the

armature is pulled away, the current is in the opposite direction, as if there were an

augmentation of the magnetism. These facts may be considered as confirming the

law enounced.

   6. Magnetism of rotation. It is well known, that when a sphere of copper is
made to turn rapidly between the poles of an electro-magnet, currents of induction

are developed in the sphere which present a considerable resistance to the movement
of rotation. The motion of the sphere of copper is always contrary to that which

the forces emanating from the electro-magnet tend to impress upon it ; but these
only originate when the movement takes place. If the law were still applicable in

1857.                                                                                                  2
                                                                                  ;

this case, we ought to find a permanent augmentation of the intensity of the cur-

rent as long as the sphere is in rotation. Different causes, amongst others the con-

cussion which inevitably accompanies the rajjid motion of the sphere, render the

experiments very difficult. The following, however, are the results which I have

Whenobtained.  the sphere is set in rotation, as long as its rapidity continues in-

creasing, a current of induction is developed, and this being added to the primitive

current, slightly increases its intensity ; when the movement of the sphere is uni-

form, the intensity again becomes the same as when the sphere was without motion

lastly, when the rotation becomes slower, the intensity is slightly diminished.

   This case, therefore, does not come under the ordinary rule, which is accounted
for because we cannot suppose that the current really produces any mechanical

work : it acts like a force which would tighten a check ; the resistance which the

sphere experiences is analogous to a friction, and becomes converted into heat,

--according to the experiment of M. Foucault.
   Part II. In his researches upon the theory of electromotors, M. Jacobi has only

occupied himself with the case in which the movement of the machine takes place in

he natural direction. But nothing in the formulae which he has given prevents their

application to the case in which the machine is compelled to take a movement oppo-

site to that which it tends to take under the influence of the electric forces. It is

Wesufficient to give a negative value to the rapidity v.    then arrive at singular

consequences.

In this case, the current of induction which M. Jacobi has called the counter-cur-

rent, would become negative, that is to say, it would be in the same direction as the

principal current, consequently the total current would be stronger whilst the

machine is animated by a negative rapidity than when it is stopped.

J^Giving the rapidity a negative value,  the total current would acquire an in-

finite intensity (formula 10 of M. Jacobi, 'Annales de Chimie et de Physique,' xxxiv.

Nowp. 451).    this rapidity would not be very great. At the same time that the in-

tensity of the current would become infinite, the mechanical work which it would be

necessary to apply to the machine to give it this rapidity would itself become infinite

(formula 19). From this it would follow, that by causing the machine to move in

a direction opposite to its natural movement, the intensity of the current might be
augmented indefinitely, and consequently mechanical work might be unlimited, con-

verted into electric current.

   Lastly, on this negative rapidity being still more increased, the current would

change its direction.

It is useless to dwell upon the theoretical and practical importance which would

Abe possessed by these consequences if they were realized.  priori we might think

that it was impossible thev should be absolutely verified, for the laws upon which

the calculation is founded have been determined between certain limits and would

cease to be correct if we passed those limits; moreover, electro-magnetic machines

present, in their construction, certain obstacles which would prevent the absolute

realization of these phenomena.

   But, on making the experiment, far from seeing the intensity of the current inde-
finitely increased, when a reversed motion is given to the machine, we observe that
the current is weakened almost as much as if the movements were effected in the
normal direction. Thus, in an experiment made with a small electro-magnetic
machine, constructed by Froment, the needle of a galvanometer deviated 57" when

the machine was kept still ; on setting the machine in motion so that 242 revolutions
in a minute were recorded, the deviation fell to 30° ; and on making it move in the
opposite direction with the same rapidity, the deviation was 32°.

   The results differ so widely from the deductions of calculation, that we must

necessarily admit the inexactitude of the formulae.

  We have already said that M. Marie Davy had disputed them ; he has indicated

two elements which have been neglected in the calculation, namely, the electrical
inertia proper to conductors, and the inertia which arises from these conductors
being rolled in a spiral, in such away that the turns of the spire act upon each other
by induction. M. Jacobi has also neglected a still more important element, which
M. Marie Davy has perhaps recognized and indicated in a recent memoir presented
         TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                       19

to the Academy of Sciences, of which the title alone is naentioned in the 'Comptes

Reudus.' This is the induction which magnetization must produce at the moment

of the closure of the circuit : as soon as the current traverses the coils of a machine,

the iron nucleus which they contain becomes magnetized, and this magnetization

must produce an energetic current of induction in a direction opposed to that of

the primitive current. When the circuit is interrupted, the demagnetization tends

to produce a direct current of induction ; but it cannot propagate itself, because the
circuit is interrupted. The two effects therefore do not compensate one another.

However, I shall refer to these experiments, which show very clearly the necessity

of taking this element into account.

  A1. small electro-magnetic machine made by Froment was employed. It con-

sists of a wheel furnished with six pieces of soft iron passing successively before the

poles of three horseshoe electro-magnets. The axle which bears this wheel, also

bears the commutator. The wheel and the pieces of soft iron were removed,

leaving the axle and the commutator in their places. Of course the machine

could no longer progress of itself, but the axle could be made to rotate, by trans-

mitting to it in a suitable manner the motion of a wheel turned by a handle. There

were then produced in the electro-magnets, alternations of magnetization and de-
magnetization similar to those which take place when the machine is in motion

under the influence of the current. When- the current is passed without the axle

being set in rotation, the deviation of the galvanometer was 48° ; then on setting the

axle in motion so as to make 408 turns in a minute, the deviation fell to about 30°
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       j

when the rapidity was increased, the deviation diminished still more.

Thus without the production of any mechanical work by the machine, and with-

out the development of those counter-currents arising from the approximation of
pieces by mutual attraction, we see that the current is considerably diminished.

This result appears to me to be perfectly incompatible with the calculations of M.

Jacobi.

A2. circuit was formed, consisting of a battery, a watch-work interrupter, and

Aa coil into which a cylinder of soft iron might be introduced at pleasure.  mag-

netized needle placed below a portion of the current deviated 32° when the iron
cylinder was not put into the interior of the coil ; but as soon as it was introduced,

the deviation fell to 25°.

   3. By means of a battery motion was given to an electro-magnetic machine, the
movement of which was produced by the magnetization and demagnetization of a
single electro-magnet, in such a way that the current was interrupted in the whole
circuit during the period of demagnetization. The circuit also included a coil of con-
siderable resistance ; the moment a cylinder of soft iron was introduced into this
coil, the motion of the machine was notably retarded.

   These three experiments show in a striking manner the loss of force which is
caused by the employment of non-continuous currents in electro-magnetic machines.
There is in this case an analogy with ordinary steam engines, in which a great part
of the force which might be produced by the heat is uselessly employed. Better
results in this respect would doubtless be obtained, if we could succeed in con-
structing machines of a certain force, founded upon the principle of the rotation of
currents by currents, or vice versa. But hitherto these machines have had too little
power to allow of their being employed as motors.

--Second Memoir. On the heat evolved by the current in a conductor, arranged so aa

                                                 to produce exterior work.

   I have already stated that when a circuit produces exterior work, a change must
be produced in the interior work, that, for example, there must be a diminution in

the heat evolved either in the part of the circuit which effects the exterior action by
induction, or in the battery itself. The former of these suppositions has been in-
vestigated in this memoir.

   The question, then, is to know, if a coil, for example, when traversed by a current
undergoes the same elevation of temperature when it exerts no exterior action, and
when it exerts one, such as the alternations of magnetization and demagnttiz'atiou
which it produces upon a nucleus of soft iron when the current is not continuous.

   The method adopted consists in arranging, in the same circuit, two coils, each

                                                                                                   g*

Weplaced in a calorimeter, which measure the quantities of heat evolved.  determine,

in the first place, the relative quantities of heat evolved in the two coils when neither

of them exerts any exterior action. The apparatus is then arranged so that one of

the coils may produce exterior work, and we see whether the relative quantities of

heat remain the same.

   The coils employed were of copper wire covered with silk ; they were placed in
calorimeters filled with rectified oil of turpentine, a non-conducting liquid, of which

the elevation of temperature was determined. The calorimeters first employed were

brass vessels, of which the annular form would allow of the introduction into the

interior of the coil, of a cylinder of soft iron, or of the body upon which the exterior

action was to be exerted. Subsequently glass calorimeters were made use of. The

calorimetric methods of M. Regnault were adopted.

In operating with a brass calorimeter and a cylinder of soft iron in the interior of

the coil, currents of induction are developed in the walls of the calorimeter itself,

which evolve a great quantity of heat ; the experiments made in this way conse-

quently present a very considerable source of error, but they demonstrate that the

exterior Avork exerted by the current is very considerable ; in fact, the excess of heat

betrayed by the calorimeter containing the soft iron, sometimes rises to ^th of the

heat evolved in the coil itself.

With glass calorimeters, after the elimination of numerous causes of error which

render these experiments very delicate, a negative result was obtained, that is to

say, the relative quantities of heat evolved in the two coils were found not to be

modified when one of these coils produced an action exterior to itself by induction.

The following are the numerical results of the last experiments which were made:

and that it is not in the part of the current which exerts an exterior action that we

must seek for the modification which the interior work must undergo under these

circumstances.

                   Description of an Arrangement of Grove's Battery.

                 By G. Johnstone Stoney, A.M., M.JR.I.A.

   The earthenware cells in this arrangement were the ordinary flat cells commonly

used for Grove's battery, consisting of flat porous cells containing nitric acid, placed

within outer cells of glazed earthenware containing acidulated water.

  A sheet of platinum foil hangs into each cell of nitric acid, and on either side two
Aparallel plates of zinc stand in the acidulated water of the outer cell. stout copper

wire effects the necessary connexion between the two zinc plates of one element and
the platinum of the next. This connecting wire takes a form somewhat resembling

that of an S, being first soldered along the top of one zinc plate ; then after a semi-
circular bend brought along the top of the other zinc plate of the same element and
soldered to it, and finally, by a second semicircular bend, brought along the top of
the platinum of the next element and soldered to it. The same mode of connexion
was of course repeated throughout the battery, with the exception of trifling and
obvious modifications at the end of each trough of cells. The soldered joints were
varnished; each of those which attach the platinum plates was further protected
from spatters and fumes by a piece of loose gutta-percha tubing, which was shpped
lengthways over the wire after its under side had been slit for the platinum foil to

pass through.
   The S-shape of the connecting wires admits of any set of metals being at any

moment withdrawn or introduced without disturbing the others.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  21

   The zincs not being folded at the bottom may be amalgamated bj' dipping them,
first into acidulated water, then into a spare outer cell filled with mercury, and
finally into their place in the battery. The excess of mercury drains off, and will

be found after the battery has been taken asunder.
    In dismounting the battery, the whole series of metals in each trough was with-

drawn together by a frame, the essential parts of which are two parallel bars of
wood, the interval between which, can be adjusted, and which are somewhat longer
than the trough. These bars are first to be separated sufficiently to enable the
frame to be passed down over the S-connecting wires of the metals. The interval
between the bars is then to be reduced, so that on raising the frame all the metals
are carried with it, being supported by the projecting semicircular bends of the con-
necting wires resting on the bars of the frame. Frame and all are to be immediately
dipped into a tank of water, and the frame with its metals then laid aside to drain

till the battery is again required.

   The workmanship of this form of battery is throughout of the simplest description*.

On Mr. Wliitehouse's Relay and Induction Coils iji action on Short Circuit.
                  By Professor W. Thomson, ZZ.i)., F.R.S.

   The peculiarities of Mr. Whitehouse's induction coils, which fit them remarkably
for the purpose for which they are adapted, as distinguished from the induction
coils by which such brilliant effects of high intensity are obtained, were described.
The chief part of the telegraphic receiving apparatus, the relay, was fully described,
and was shown inaction, through thirty yards of the Atlantic cable, after some re-

--marks explaining the general nature of a relay, an electrical hair-trigger. The

relation of Mr. Whitehouse's relay to the Henley receiving instrument, was pointed
out. The author expressed his conviction, that by using Mr. Whitehouse's. system
of taking advantage of each motion for a single signal, instead of the to-and-fro
motion, as in all systems hitherto practised, the Henley single needle instrument
might be easily used, so as to give as great a speed on one line of wire alone, as is
at present attained by two with the double needle instrument, 'i'he beautiful method
of reading by bells would be most ready and convenient for giving the indications to
be interpreted as the messages, but the author believes that either by the eye or ear,
messages may be read off with the rapidity and ease which will render the use of
one telegraph wire in all respects as satisfactory as that of two.

      On the Effects of Induction in long Submarine Lines of Telegraph.
                 By Professsor W. Thomson, LL.D., F.R.S.

  A general explanation of the theory was given, and the "law of squares" was

proved to be rigorously true. It was pointed out, that when the resistances of the
instruments employed to generate and to receive the electric current are consider-

able in comparison with the resistance of the line, the observed phenomena do not
fulfil the law of squares, because the conditions on which that law is founded are
deviated from. The application of the theory to the alternate " positive " and
" negative" electrical actions used by Mr. Whitehouse for telegraphing was explained,
and the circumstances which practically limit the speed of working were pointed
out. Curves illustrating the enfeeblement of the current towards the remote end of
the telegraph line, and the consequent necessity of the high pressure system intro-
duced by Mr. Whitehouse, were shown. The embarrassment occasioned by the
great electrical effect through the wire, which follows the commencement of a series
of uniform signals with a full strength of electrical force, was illustrated in one dia-
gram, which showed a succession of eight impulses following one another at equal
intervals of time, and giving only one turn of the electrical tide at the remote end,
or two motions of the relay, including the initial effect. The remedy suggested by

the author was illustrated by another diagram, in which a succession of seven equal
alternate applications of positive and negative force following a first impulse of half

Outline of a TJieory of the Structure and Magnetic Phenomena of the Globe.

                               By J. Drummond.

The author, from the admitted fact of our earth having cooled down from an

original state of fluidity, and that it now is a solid crust enclosing a fluid mass of

molten materials, held that there must be an action of the sun and moon on this

fluid mass analogous to that which caused the tides of the ocean ; that from thence

an outward pressure on the crust must result, propagated along it, in a manner

similar to the great tidal wave ; and from this principle, in an elaborate essay, he

deduced the ordinary magnetic phenomena, as well as volcanoes, earthquakes, and

other  violent  actions                                    concluding  by  answering  objections  which  may  be  urged

    On a singular Acoustic Phenomenon. By M. Donovan, M.R.LA.

   The author explained the beats which are experienced when two strings tuned
nearly, but not exactly, to unison, are struck at the same time. He then stated
that Earl Stanhope had observed these beats in all the tuning-forks tried by him,
which he attributed to inequality of the prongs. Earl Stanhope, in consequence, had
been at the pains to invent a new tuning instrument. This effect the author often
tried to experience, but never could succeed until upon one occasion, just after he had
ceased from violent exercise, having applied the fork to his teeth, he distinctly heard
the beats. He was thus led to the true origin of the phenomenon, which he could
now experience whenever he wished, by running a short distance, particularly up and
down stairs. The effect was caused by the beatings of his own heart, which are
synchronous with those of the fork.

                 On the Effect of fVind on the Intensity of Sound.

             By Professor G. G. Stokes, i1!/.^.,Z>.C'.Z/., Sec.R.S.

   The remarkable diminution in the intensity of sound, v^'hich is produced when a
strong wind blows in a direction from the observer towards the source of sound, is

familiar to everybody, but has not hitherto been explained, so far as the author is

aware. At first sight we might be disposed to attribute it merely to the increase in
the radius of the sound-wave which reaches the observer. The whole mass of air
being supposed to be carried uniformly along, the time which the sound would take
to reach the observer, and consequently the radius of the sound-wave, would be in-
creased by the wind in the ratio of the velocity of sound to the sum of the velocities
of sound and of the wind, and the intensity would be diminished in the inverse
duplicate ratio. But the effect is much too great to be attributable to this cause.
It would be a strong wind, whose velocity was a twenty-fourth part of that of
sound yet even in this case the intensity would be diminished by only about a

twelfth part. The first volume of the 'Annales de Chimie ' (1816) contains a
paper by M. Delaroche, giving the results of some experiments made on this sub-

--ject. It appeared from the experiments, first, that at small distances the wind

has hardly any perceptible effect, the sound being propagated almost equally well in
a direction contrary to the wind and in the direction of the wind ; secondl)', that
the disparity between the intensity of the sound propagated in these two directions
hecomes proportionally greater and greater as the distance increases ; thirdly, that
sound is propagated rather better in a direction perpendicular to the wind than even
in the direction of the wind. The explanation offered by the author of the present

communication is as follows. If we imagine the whole mass of air in the neigh-

bourhood of the source of disturbance divided into horizontal strata, these strata do
not all move with the same velocity. The lower strata are retarded by friction
against the earth, and by the various obstacles they meet with ; the upper by friction
against the lower, and so on. Hence the velocity increases from the ground upwards^
conformably with observation. This difference of velocity disturbs the spherical
form of the sound-wave, tending to make it somewhat of the form of an ellipsoid,
the section of which by a vertical diametral plane parallel to the direction of the
wind is an ellipse meeting the ground at an obtuse angle on the side towards which

the wind is blowing, and an acute angle on the opposite side. Now, sound tends

to propagate itself in a direction perpendicular to the sound-wave ; and if a portion
of the wave is intercepted by an obstacle of large size, the space behind is left in a
sort of sound-shadow, and the only sound there heard is what diverges from the
general wave after passing the obstacle. Hence, near the earth, in a direction con-
trary to the wind, the sound continually tends to be propagated upwards, and con-
sequently there is a continual tendency for an observer in that direction to be left in
a sort of sound-shadow. Hence, at a sufficient distance, the sound ought to be
very much enfeebled ; but near the source of disturbance this cause has not yet had
time to operate, and therefore the wind produces no sensible effect, except what
arises from the augmentation in the radius of the sound-wave, and this is too small

to be perceptible. In the contrary direction, that is, in the direction towards
which the wind is blowing, the sound tends to propagate itself downwards, and to
be reflected from the surface of the earth ; and both tbe direct and reflected waves

contribute to the effect perceived. The two waves assist each other so much the
better, as the angle between them is less, and this angle vanishes in a direction per-

pendicular to the wind. Hence, in the latter direction the sound ought to be pro-
pagated a little better than even in the direction of the wind, which agrees with the

experiments of M. Delaroche. Thus the effect is referred to two known causes,
the increased velocity of the air in ascending, and the diffraction of sound.

            On the Distribution of the Orbits of the Comets in Space.

                         By Cavaliere O. F. Mosotti.

   The author not being present, this communication was read and explained by
Prof. Bolzani. The author commenced by explaining that the simplest and most
direct method of analysing the distribution of the comets in space would seem to be,
to divide the celestial sphere by means of so many circles parallel to the ecliptic into
equal zones corresponding to an aliquot part of the entire superficies, and then to
ascertain how man)' culminating points are contained in each of these. If the orbits
were uniformly distributed throughout space, each of them should contain about an
equal number of these points ; if not, the greater or less number contained in each
will serve to show the tendency the orbits have to approach to or recede from that
distribution. The author applied this method arithmetically in the first instance
and afterwards, in order to render the results more palpable, reduced them to a
graphic construction. The learned Professor then exhibited and explained to the
Section, in detail, the several formulae on which the numerical examination of the
question was founded, and then exhibited and explained the graphic construction
                                                                                ;

reduced to a planisphere. The same planisphere, when properly projected, was
made to serve for both the northern and southern hemispheres, by colouring the
projecting lines which marked radially on the outer circle the longitudes of the cul-

minating points and of the perihelia for the northern hemisphere blue, and for the

southern black ; and on each of these radial lines was marked the number assigned
to the comet in the catalogue of the 263 discussed by the author. If, then, we con-

ceive these two lines to be produced to the centre, and caused to revolve towards the

northern hemisphere if marked with the sign plus, to the southern if marked minus,

until they take the position of the inclination of the orbit marked as belonging to

each, the position of the two lines will present to the mind a picture of the position

which the orbit will hold as well in space as in its own plane. At the end of each

of the eight tables, corresponding to the eight zones, were specified the total num-

ber of orbits found in that zone, as well as the number of those having their peri-

helia in the northern or southern hemisphere, and their motion direct or retrograde;

combining the data thence given, the author drew up the summary of the whole.

He found the orbits to have a tendency to approach in prevailing numbers the polar

regions of the ecliptic. The minimum occurs in the fifth zone of each hemisphere.

Those whose perihelia are in the northern hemisphere exceed those whose perihelia

are in the southern in the proportion of 3 to 2 ; the number of those having a

direct motion to those retrograde as 5 to 6, or nearly equal. The author calls the

WayGreat Circle, which passes so as to divide the Milky  pretty equally, the Galaxy

Circle. In the centre of this the sun and earth may be considered to be placed

it cuts the ecliptic towards the solstitial points, and is inclined to it at about 60''.

He then finds that the planes of the orbits of the comets are, for the most part,

little, if at all, inclined to the plane of the Galaxy Circle, and that they go on de-

creasing in number as that inclination increases ; and therefore he concludes that

some cosmical cause must have led to such a result. Also, the perihelia of by far

the greater number of those he has discussed are found near the Galaxy Circle,

showing that when they are passing most closely under the influence of the sua

they are both near the Galaxy Circle, and their proper motion is nearly parallel to

its plane. Hence the greater number of comets come to us from the region of the

Galaxy itself.

On a Moveable Horizontal Sun-dial, lohich shows correct Solar Time within
           a Fraction of a Bliniitc. By M. Donovan, M.R.I.A.

   The author first pointed out the inaccuracies incidental to or inseparable from the
ordinary horizontal sun-dial, even when executed with the greatest care. He then
adverted to the peculiarities of his own dial, showing how it can be placed with the

greatest precision in the meridian of the place. After alluding to the defects of the

ordinary style, he showed the advantages of substituting a human hair, which, cast-

ing a shadow as slender as itself for several inches of its length, affords a line of
direction for another hair springing from the same source, which, when stretched
through the centre of the most slender part of the shadow, marks the precise time to
a few seconds on a large divided circle. One of the peculiarities of this dial is, that
it may be placed in any spot illuminated by the sun ; an advantage, from which the
common horizontal dial is precluded by its being a fixture, and without means of

exactly placing its meridian in the meridian of the place.

            On the Direction of Gravity at the Earth's Surface.

covers three-fourths of the entire spheroid, gravity would be perpendicular to it at
every point. If, however, the earth were stripped of all its seas and oceans, the
surface would present considerable inequalities. From what is now known regard-
ing the depth of the ocean, the continents would appear as plateaus elevated above
the oceanic depressions to an amount which, although small compared to the earth's
radius, would be considerable when compared to its outswelling at the equator,
and its flattening towards the poles. The surface thus presented would be the
true surface of the earth, and would not be perpendicular to gravity. If a mean

surface be conceived intersecting this, so as to leave equal volumes above of eleva-

tions, and of depressions below it, it is not allowable to assume that such a surface
is perpendicular to gravity. The mean surface of the solid crust of the earth would

not be perpendicular to gravity, if, after the process of solidification had commenced,
any extensive changes in the distribution of matter in the earth's interior could take
place. If the fluid matter in solidifying underwent no change of volume, the forms
of the strata of equal density within the earth would be the same as those of the
primitive fluid mass, and would continue to be the same at every stage of its solidi-
fication. But if, as observation indicates, such fused matter, on passing to the solid
crystalline state, should diminish in volume, the pressure on the remaining strata of
the fluid would be relieved, and they would tend to assume a greater ellipticity than
they had when existing under a greater pressure. The general result of this action
would manifestly be to produce a change in the direction of the attractive forces at
the outer surface of the solid crust. The direction of a plumb-line would be altered
so as to slightly increase the apparent latitudes of places over a zone intermediate
between the equator and poles.

                    On the Solidification of Fluids by Pressure.

                      By Professor Hennessy, M.R.I.A.

   The views put forward were deduced from some propositions in the dynamical
theory of heat contained in the writings of Prof. W. Thomson and Prof. Clausius.
The general result arrived at regarding the influence of pressure on a fluid so cir-
cumstanced as to lose no part of the heat acquired by condensation, would be, that
so long as the matter continued in a fluid condition, the resistance to compression
from this cause would be very small. If, however, the fluid were on the point of
changing its state to that of solidity, the effect of the latent heat of fusion, which by
hypothesis could not be emitted, would interpose a resistance of great magnitude
compared to that resulting from simple compression. The fused matter of which
the interior of the earth most probably consists, would be under conditions similar
to those mentioned, from the slow conducting power of the materials composing
the earth, and from the pressure of all the outermost strata of equilibrium of the
fluid upon those ne'ar the centre ; and thus the influence of pressure in promoting
solidification would be less than at its surface.

On the relative Accuracy of the different Methods of determining

        Geographical Longitude. By Professor Loomis.

The author first gave a rapid sketch of the several methods of determining differ-

ences of longitude adopted by astronomers and geographers, and pointed out the

degree of accuracy that might be expected from each; and drew, as the conclusion of

this branch of his subject, the importance of obtaining a method far more accurate

than any of the preceding, and in which the personal equations of the observers

would either be eliminated or greatly reduced; and such a desideratum he considered

was afforded by the electric telegraph. He then explained at length the various

methods resorted to by Dr. Bache, Prof. Morse, himself, and other American philo-

sophers, the chief peculiarity of which was using either a sidereal and mean-time

clock at the recording-station                                                                                                            the beats of these, coinciding every six minutes, gave
                                                                                                                                       ;

second from the observing end or station ; or by using a sidereal clock and chrono-

meter, beating twice each second, intervals of three minutes became similarly marked

recorded by interchanging the observers at these stations, the nstruments remaining
unchanged, and by various mechanical improvements in the recording apparatus of
the telegraph, chiefly with a view to ensure uniformity of motion in the slips on
which the recording dots were impressed, he showed that a degree of accuracy

--hitherto not approached by any other method had been obtained, the error of botli

clocks disappearing also in the results, if only their rates had been made perfect.

On a Proposalfor the Establishment of a Unform Reckoning of Time in

Byco7i)iexion tvith the Telegraph.  J. J. Murphy.

   The author said, that as in Britain the establishment of the telegraph had made
it necessary to adopt Greenwich time all over the country, where the difference was
small this was possible, but when the telegraph extended to America, or greater
distances, it would cease to be so. He proposed that all clocks should be furnished

with a double circle of figures on the dial, the outer circle being moveable through

any required number of degrees. When a clock is set up at any place, let the hands

show local time on the inner circle; and let the outer circle be so set, that the hour-
hand will on it show Greenwich time.

           On some Phenomena in connexion with Molten Substances.
                                 Bxj J. Nasmyth, F.R.A.S.

   The author stated, on introducing the above subject to the notice of the Section,
that his object in so doing was to direct the attention of scientific men to a class of
phenomena, which although in their main features they might be familiar to practical
men, yet appeared to have escaped the attention of those who were more engaged
in scientific research. The great fact which he desired to call attention to is com-

prised in the following general proposition, namely, that all substances in a molten
condition are specifically heavier than the same substance in an unmolteu state.

Hitherto water has been supposed to be a singular and special exception to the ordi-
nary law, namely, that as substances were elevated in temperature they became
specifically lighter, that is to say, water at temperature 32° on being heated does on
its progress towards temperature 40° become more dense and specifically heavier
until it reaches 40°, after which, if we continue to elevate the temperature, its den-
sity progressively decreases. From the facts which Mr. Nasmyth brought forward,
it appears that water is not a special and singular exception in this respect, but
that, on the contrary, the phenomenon in relation to change of density (when near
the point of solidification) is shared with every substance with which we are at all
familiar in a molten state, so entirely so, that Mr. Nasmyth felt himself warranted
in propounding, as a general law, the one before stated, namely, that in every in-
stance in which he has tested its existence, he finds that a moltci> substance is more
dense, or specifically heavier, than the same substance in its unmolten state. It is

on account of this, that if we throw a piece of solid lead into a pot of melted lead,
the solid, or unmolten metal, will float in the fluid, or molten metal. Mr. Nasmyth
stated, that he found that this fact of the floating of the unmolten substance in the
molten, holds true with every substance on which he has tested the existence of the
phenomenon in question ; as, for instance, in the case of lead, silver, copper, iron,
zinc, tin, antimony, bismuth, glass, pitch, rosin, wax, tallow, &c. ; and that the
same is the case with respect to alloys of metals and mixtures of any of the above-
named substances : also, that the normal condition as to density is resumed in
most substances a little on the molten side of solidification, and in a few cases the
resumption of the normal condition occurs during the act of solidification. He also
stated, that, from experiments which he had made, he had reason to believe that by
heating molten metals up to a temperature far beyond their melting-point, the point
of maximum density was, as in the case of water, at 40° about to be passed ; and
that at such very elevated temperatures, the normal state, as regards reduction of
density by increase of temperature, was also resumed, but that as yet he has not
been able to test this point with such certainty as to warrant him to allude further

to its existence.

   Mr. Nasmyth concluded his observations by stating, that he considered this to be
a Bubject wejl-worthy of the attention of geologists, who might find in it a key to

the explanation of many eruptive or upheaving phenomena, which the earth's crust,
and especially that of the moon, present, namely, that on the approach to the

point of solidification molten mineral substances then beneath the solid crust of the
earth must, in accordance with the above-stated law, expand, and tend to elevate or

--burst up the solid crust, and also express upwards, through the so cracked surface,

streams more or less fluid of those mineral substances which we know must have
been originally in a molten condition. Mr. Nasmyth stated, that the aspect of the
lunar surface, as revealed to us by powerful telescopes, appeared to him to yield
most striking confirmation of the above remark. He concluded by expressing a hope,
that the facts which he had brought forward might receive the careful attention of
scientific men, which their important bearing on the phenomena in question
appeared to him to entitle them to.

                     On certain Planetary Perturbations. By the Rev. VV. G. Penny.

It appears that there are in the motions of several of the planets inequalities

arising from the product of the disturbing forces of two planets, which inequalities

appear to have been but little noticed hitherto, but which seem to be much larger

than might have been expected, owing to the length of time during which they

are accumulating. The most remarkable is one which exists in the motions of

Mars and the earth. Its period is about 1800 years, or about twice that of the

long inequality of Jupiter and Saturn. In the case of the earth it appears to amount

to about 7i", and is owing to the product of the disturbing forces of Jupiter and
Mars ; and in the case of Mars it seems to amount to about 45^", and is owing to

the product of the disturbing forces of Jupiter and the Earth. It arises from the

fact, that four times the mean motion of the earth is very nearly equal to eight times

that of Mars minus three times that of Jupiter. Its value for the earth is repre-

sented by the following equation :

and for Mars by the equation

where Ma, Wj, tit are the mean motions of the earth. Mars, and Jupiter. This

inequality is remarkable as being, if the work is correct, larger, and in the case of

--Mars very considerably so, than any which arise from the simple perturbation of a

single planet, the largest hitherto known in the case of the earth amounting to only
7"' 15, and in the case of Mars to 25""5. Also, there will be a corresponding inequality

in the motion of the moon, which I have not yet examined, but which may, perhaps,

be sensible ; for, according to the investigations of M. Hansen, the inequality in the
motion of the earth discovered by Prof. Airy, amounting to 2""04, with a period of 240

3'ears, produces one of not less than 23" in the motion of the moon, so that, judging

hy analogy, there ought to be a sensible inequality in the present case also. Again,

there seems to be an inequality in the motions of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus, with a

periodofsomewhatmore than 1700years, and amounting in the case of Jupiter to about

10"                  and in the case of Saturn to about 40";  and in that of Uranus to 43".  It arises
                  ;

from the fact, that six times the mean motion of Saturn is nearly equal to twice that

of Jupiter plus three times that of Uranus. There are several others besides these of

less importance, arising from the product of two disturbing forces ; and thereis even one

which results from the product of three. forces, and appears to amount to nearly 7".

There are also several inequalities of the same kind in some of the asteroids, which are
very much larger than any in the motions of the principal planets ; but as the theory

of the asteroids is considered to be of comparatively little interest, I have not sent

them.

On Transit Observations of the Moon. By the Rev. T. R. Robinson, D.D.

Dr. Loomis's remarks on longitudes, deduced from the method of moon culmi-

nating stars, reminded him of the results which he had formerly obtained by it.

The high praise given to it by the German astronomers, and his valued friend the
late Mr. Baily, had induced him to attend to it particularly when determining the
longitude of the Armagh Observatory. He found it very unsatisfactory. The longi-

tudes, deduced by comparison on the same night with Dublin, Greenwich, Paris, and

Konigsberg, all first-rate Observatories, were very discordant ; and those deduced
--28 REPORT 1857.

from the first limb by himself, and the second by his assistant, once differed 50".

He found the cause of this to be, that the personal equation of the observers differs,
and unequally, for the two limbs, and both are greater than for stars. The reason
of this is obvious, for the field round the moon is very dark by contrast, and it is
not easy to compare a luminous space with a dark one. He found that in fog,

when the field is nearly as bright as the lunar disc, the longitudes were the most
consistent, and this led to a mode of illuniiBation which proved effective, and which he

now mentioned in hope that it might be useful to travellers, as a most effective means
of getting longitude, if provided with a transit, especially one similar to the " Broken
telescope" of Reichenbach's universal instrument. He placed in front of the object-

glass a disk of emerald glass, from the centre of which a circle is cut, four-tenths
of the diameter of the object-glass. This portion forms the image, but the remaming
portion fills the field with scattered light from the moon, while it contributes none

to the image. The effect is similar to that of the fog, and it nearly reduces the per-
sonal error to that of stars. The small aperture, however, gives a larger diameter

of the moon, and therefore both limbs should be used in nearly equal proportion.
With these precautions he thought the longitude could be obtained more certainly
than by any other means within the reach of a traveller, certainly far surpassing the

ordinary one of lunar distances.

                  Notice of Meteorological Observations made at Sea.
                   Communicated by Rear-Admiral FitzRot, F.R.S.

   Admiral FitzRoy drew the attention of the Section to the meteorological papers
lying on the table, which had been recently published by the Board of Trade. The
Report to which he referred would show what progress had been made, and therefore
he would not occupy valuable time by entering into verbal details. He would only
observe generally, that a great number of valuable observations had already been made

on board some hundred ships, with excellent instruments approved by the Kew Com-

mittee of the British Association, and that those observations were regularly tabu-
lated in such a manner as to admit of their being combined in groups or used indi-
viduallv. The willing cooperation of ofiicers at sea had already accumulated more
observations than can be reduced and tabulated with corresponding quickness ; there-
fore more reduction of observations, rather than more observers with a larger number
of instruments, seems necessary ; and this can only be accomplished by employing
a larger staff. The Government had shown the utmost willingness to attend to the
recommendations of competent authorities with respect to the establishment and
support of the Meteorological Office at the Board of Trade ; and only desired to
apply the vote sanctioned by Parliament for meteorological observations at sea to the
best possible advantage. The United States, Great Britain, and Holland, bad already
cooperated largely in this work ; and France had lately established a similar depart-

ment for collecting and discussing such observations.

On the Variation in the Quantity of Rain due to the Moon's Position in

Byreference to the Plane of the Earth's Orbit.   C. Fu lb rook.

   The author called attention to an important difference in the amount of rain which
falls in these latitudes at opposite parts of the moon's course with reference to the

--plane of the earth's orbit : a result obtained by placing horizontally (from the daily

register of Howard, in the vicinity of London) the amount of rain (when any) due
to each day throughout a lunar course, and so on for 100 courses in due order.

The following Table exhibits the result:

This effect the author supposes to be due to alternate southerly and northerly cur-
rents depending on the ascent and descent of the moon through the plane of the
earth's orbit. Be this as it may, it is reasonable to infer, that when she is thus in
some way producing an excess of rain in these latitudes, comparatively dry weather
obtains in corresponding southern latitudes, and vice versa; and that intermediate

latitudes experience an intermediate degree of the effect. Meteorologists of other

latitudes and distant countries, who may possess a register of the weather extending

over one hundred courses, or about seven years and a half, should try the result for

their respective latitudes, and transmit their conclusions to the author.

 On Simultaneous Isothermal Lines. By Professor Hennessy, M.R.I.A.

   Having briefly referred to the interest shown by the Association in the question
of distribution of temperature over the surface of the earth bj' the publication of
the maps of Prof. Dove, and acknowledged the importance of the results furnished
by a comparison of mean temperatures in connexion with the climatology of the globe,
Mr. Hennessy proceeded to describe the new species of isothermals now proposed.
--99 REPORT 1857.

If temperature were recorded at every station on the surface of the earth at the
mean time corresponding to any given meridian, then a line traversing the places
where such temperatures were found to be equal would be a simultaneous isothermal
line. The forms of such lines would manifestly depend on the diurnal range cf tem-
perature at the several stations, as well as the several physical conditions influencing
mean temperature. If the earth were absolutely at rest, and stripped of its fluid
coverings, these lines would be circles, having their planes perpendicular to a line
joining the centres of the earth and sun. This would be nearly the case in a body
turning very slowly on its axis, like our satellite, in which Prof. Hennessy anticipated
that observations would ultimately show a great diminution of heat radiated from
the edges compared to the centre of the illuminated disk. With a more rapid motion
of rotation, as in the case of the earth, the isothcrmals would be elongated in a direction

parallel to that of the rotation. On introducing the influence of all the actual motions
of the earth, and of the emissive and absorbing powers of the atmosphere, the ground,
and the sea, the forms of these lines would be considerably modified. The forms of the
isothermals on the land and sea would necessarily differ, and might be expected to
present some important relations to the directions of land and sea breezes. It
appears, in general, far more probable that a knowledge of the contemporaneous
 conditions of temperature at different places would assist in pointing to a connexion
 between these phenomena and atmospheric perturbations rather than a knowledge
 of mean temperature. Atmospheric currents, whether vertical or parallel to the

 Aearth's surface, depend upon contemporaneous differences of temperature. similar

 remark might be applied to many other important atmospheric phenomena, and these
 lines would also serve to indicate more clearly, or to lessen the possibility of the
 supposed connexion between terrestrial magnetism and terrestrial temperature.

        On the Distribution of Heat over the Surface of the British Isles,

                       By Professor Henislessy, M.R.I.A.

     Since the author had communicated to the Section at the Cheltenham Meeting of
 the Association an account of his general views as to the laws of distribution of
 isothermal lines, further confirmation of these views had arisen. It had been already
 shown that the isothermals in Ireland are partly closed curves surrounding a space
 of minimum temperature, having its centre a Uttle to the north-east of the centre of
 the island. With the aid of the observations collected and published by Mr. Glaisher,
 those contained in Prof. Dove's Reports, and a few additional isolated results, the
 isothermals for Great Britain have been laid down on the map exhibited to the

 Section. No correction has been made for elevation above the sea-level, as atmo-

 spherical phenomena do not depend upon the fictitious temperatures so deduced, but
 upon their actual amounts. This non-reduction would partly account for the remark-
 able decrease in temperature in going from the coast towards the interior of the
 island, and by which the space of minimum temperature in Great Britain appears to
  occupy a position between the midland counties of England and the north of Scot-
  land, where it expands to its greatest breadth. The influence of distance from the
  sea and of height above it are, doubtless, both combined in producing the remarkable
  forms of the isothermals of the British Isles, and it would therefore be desirable in
  future tables of the distribution of temperature to have the former element noted in
  connexion with each station as well as the latter.

                       On the Vertical Currents of the Atmosphere.

                        By Professor Hennessy, M.R.I.A.

     The anemoscope described by the author at the Cheltenham Meeting of the Asso-
  ciation having been since modified, has enabled him not only to observe the vertical
  direction of atmospheric currents, but also to compare the intensity of the vertical
  with the horizontal force of such currents. This is done by observing the angle of
  inclination of a moveable flange, which is turned by the vertical and horizontal com-
  ponents of the current until it is in equilibrium. By integrating the elements
  these components at each side of the flange, it was easily shown that the horizontal
  force, multiplied by the tangent of the angle of inclination, would give the vertical

                                           M

force of the wind, and that the absolute force would be found by multiplying the

horizontal force by the secant of the inclination. The vertical anemoscope might

thus be usefully combined with one of the horizontal anemometers now in use in
meteorological observatories. Among the general results of Prof. Hennessy's obser-

vations, it appears that the wind rarely blows in a perfectly horizontal direction.

The deviations from that direction, although usually very small, are sometimes very

remarkable, and follow each other in such a way, especially during strong breezes,

as to indicate a species of undulatory motion in the wind. The force of the wind

given by horizontal anemometers is thus almost always a little inferior to its actual

mechanical energy. True vertical currents are sometimes indicated by the anemo-

scope when the flange points continuously and steadily in an upward or downward

direction. This is usually observed when the air is otherwise in a comparatively

calm state. The vertical ascending currents, which have been long supposed to take

place over the land during fine weather, in connexion with the phenomena of sea

and land breezes, were often very distinctly observed. The obvious connexion of

vertical currents with changes of temperature and other atmospheric disturbances,

points to the importance of observing them, as well as the horizontal movements of

the air.           .

Admiral Smyth by TuUey, is only 3j inches, and the object-glass of the RadcIifFe
equatoreal is 7^ inches. The planet was seen again in the evening of the 22nd of
August with the Radcliife equatoreal, but exceedingly faint ; and on the evening of
the 23rd, it was again seen with the Smythian refractor, and it appeared but a very
little fainter with the latter than with the former ; which fact may serve to put
amateur astronomers on their guard in the purchase of object-glasses, and as evidence

that the largest object-glasses are not necessarily the best.

On the Results of Measurements of y Virginis for the Epoch 1857. By Rear-

  Admiral Smyth, D.C.L., F.R^S. {Comnninicated by Dr. Lee, F.R.S.)

    The fine double star y Virginis, to which Admiral Smyth has for some years

devoted much attention, is one of the most remarkable specimens of a binary sj'stem

in the sidereal regions, the history of which is fully related both in his work ' The

Celestial Cycle,' and the ' jEdes Hartwelliana;.' It has been very assiduously

watched by the best astronomers of the age, and its motions so clearly ascertained,

as to offer sufficient phenomena to induce a conviction that the Newtonian law of

gravitation obtains in the remote stellar regions. Besides the Hartwell observations,

the latest series of which are here presented, this epoch 1857 has been also watched

by  the Astronomer Royal,  Mr. Airy  ;  and  by the  Rev. W.  R.  Dawes,  of  Haddenham
                                                                                                                               ;

and by Lord Wrottesley, at his well-conducted observatory, near Wolverhampton
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

merits of Admiral Smyth, I might refer to Lord Wrottesley, to whom the public are

indebted, not only for his attentions to the orbit of this star, but also for his import-

ant Catalogue of Stars, as well as for the services which he has rendered to this

Association as President of the Royal Society.

On certain Electrical Phenomena in the l/nited States. By Professor Loomis.

   Atmospheric electricity is very abundant in the United States, and often exhibits
phenomena more remarkable than are witnessed in most of the countries of Europe,
especially in England and Germany. These phenomena are not confined to any
particular season of the year ; but the exhibitions in summer appear under a dif-
ferent form from those of winter. In summer, free electricity exhibits itself chiefly
in the form of lightning during thunder-storms ; and these exhibitions are often among
the most sublime and impressive phenomena witnessed in any part of the globe. The
telegraph wires are exceedingly sensitive to the approach of a thunder-storm. The
wires are often charged with electricity, from the eflects of a storm so distant that

no thunder is heard or lightning seen. 1 have often stood at such times in a tele-

graph office, and introduced my own body into the electric circuit, by taking hold of

a telegraph wire with one hand, and with the other hand grasping a wire which

Acommunicated with the earth. frequent twinge is felt in the arms and sometimes

through the breast. The shock is pungent and painful, even when scarcely the
slightest spark can be obtained by bringing the two wires nearly in contact. Such
experiments are unsafe when the electric cloud is near. If, during the passage of a
thunder-shower, the telegraph apparatus is left in communication with the long tele-
graph wires, the fine wires of the electro-magnets are almost sure to be melted, and
the magnets thereby rendered useless. Sometimes, in telegraphic offices, there occurs
an explosion, which melts large wires and is dangerous to human life. The effect
of a feeble current of atmospheric electricity on the telegraph wires is the same as
of a current from a galvanic battery. It makes a dot on the telegraph register ; and
when a thunder-storm passes in the neighbourhood of a telegraph line, those dots are
of constant occurrence ; and being interposed between the dots of the telegraph
operators, they render the writing confused and often illegible. The operators are
therefore commonly compelled to abandon their work when a thunder-shower pre-
vails in the vicinity of any part of the line.

   The aurora borealis is very common in the United States, even in summer; but,

on account of the long-continued twilight, it is seldom witnessed with such brilliancy
in summer as in winter. During winter, thunder-storms in the United States are of
very rare occurrence ; but even at this season they are not entirely unknown. Some-

The aurora borealis is very common in the United States, even in summer; but,

on account of the long-continued twilight, it is seldom witnessed with such brilliancy

in summer as in winter. During winter, thunder-storms in the United States are of

very rare occurrence; but even at this season they arc not entirely unknown. Some-

times in mid-winter, after a series of unusually warm days, a strong wind suddenly

springs up from the west, attended by a shower, during which several flashes of

lightning, accompanied by thunder, are noticed. Such a shower is invariably

followed by a great and sudden fall of the thermometer. But while electrical dis-

charges in the form of lightning are rarely witnessed in winter, other electrical phe-

nomena of great interest are of almost daily occurrence. Those phenomena consist

of free electricity residing upon almost all bodies resting on the earth, but suflSciently

insulated. This free electricity is particularly noticeable on the clothes and hair of

the human body. During the cold months of winter, the human hair is commonly

electrical, and especially when it is brushed with a fine comb. Often at such times

the fine hairs are seen to stand erect ; and the more you comb to make them smooth,

the more obstinately they refuse to keep their proper place. If you present your

fingers to those electrified hairs, they fly to meet you, like a lock of dry hair attached

to the prime conductor of an electric machine. In such cases there is but one

remedy ; the hair must be thoroughly moistened, after which it lies quietly in its

place. During the same season of the year, all woollen articles of clothing become

highly charged with free electricity. The pantal6ons in particular are found to

attract light floating particles of dust, down, &c., especially near the feet ; and it is

impossible to cleanse them by brushing. The longer you brush, the more your

clothes are covered with dust and lint. Nothing less than a wet sponge is efficient

to cleanse them. At night, when you take off your pantaloons, you hear a distinct

crackling noise, and in a dark room perceive a succession of flashes. You draw

your fingers down over them, especially near the lower extremities, and you perceive

a repetition of the crackling noise, accompanied by distinct flashes of light. As you

take oif your flannel drawers, the crackling is again heard, louder than before, and

the flashes of light are more vivid. If you take a woollen blanket from your bed,

hold it suspended in your left-hand, and draw the fingers of your right-hand over

it, the crackling is equally loud and longer continued. Your fingers seem enveloped

in a blaze of light, and the flashes can be several times renewed. Brute animals do

not escape the general electrical influence. In a cold frosty night, you draw your

hand gently over a cat's back, and you hear a distinct crackling noise, while the cat

shows unmistakeable signs of bad temper, and refuses her consent to play the philo-

sopher with you. Persons riding on horseback during a snow-storm in the night

have frequently noticed the extremities of their horse's ears tipped with light, like
that of a pale, steady flame. The preceding phenomena are either unknown in sum-

mer or are only noticed occasionally, and in an inferior degree ; but the aurora

borealis is often witnessed in the United States during winter, and frequently attains

a splendour such as is surpassed in but few portions of the globe. During the seve-

rity of winter, and especially in houses which are furnished with heavy carpets and

kept thoroughly warmed, even more remarkable electrical phenomena are often wit-

nessed. If you walk across such a carpet with a slight shuffling motion, and then

present your knuckle to some metallic object, as the knob of a door, you perceive a

decided spark and a faint snap. By walking rapidly two or three times back and

forth, the spark may be increased, arid becomes, perhaps, a quarter of an inch or

more in length, and has great intensity accompanied by a smart snap. This phe-

nomenon is not peculiar to any particular house or style of carpet, but in the cold

months can be witnessed in almost every house in New York where there is a thick

woollen carpet, and the room is kept habitually well-heated and dry. In some houses

these phenomena are so remarkable that persons who have never witnessed them have

listened to the accounts with evident incredulity.

  A few winters ago I received from a female friend an account of some phenomena
which she had witnessed at the house of Mrs. C. in New York, and which appeared

so remarkable that I concluded the account must be greatly exaggerated. I was in-

duced to call on Mrs. C, and request her to favour me with an exhibition of her

Weelectrical powers, to which request she readily acceded.  were sitting in a par-

lour covered with a heavy velvet carpet, and lighted with gas by a chandelier suspended

from the ceiling. Mrs. C. rose from her chair, advanced one or two short steps, and

gave a slight spring towards the chandelier, which was above her reach when her feet

rested upon the floor. As her finger approached the metal I perceived a brilliant

spark and heard a snap such as would have attracted the attention of a person casu-

ally walking through the hall, separated from the parlour by a closed door. The

spark was more brilliant than that which is furnished by an ordinary electrophorus

Awhen most highly excited, but its length was not so great.    few steps upon the

carpet were sufficient to renew the electric charge, and the spark was perceived when-

ever Mrs. C. touched a metallic object, like the knob of a door or the gilded frame of

a mirror. The facts which had been before recited to me now no longer appeared in-
credible, and most of them I verified by my own observations. On approaching the

speaking tube to give orders to the servants, Mrs. C. repeatedly received a very un-

pleasant shock in the mouth, and was very much annoyed by the electricity until

she learned first to touch tVie tube with her finger. In passing from one parlour to

the other, if she chanced to step upon the brass plate which served as a slide for the

Afolding-doors, she received an unpleasant shock in the foot.  visitor upon enter-

ing the house, in attempting to shake hands with Mrs. C, received a shock which

was quite noticeable and somewhat unpleasant. A lady on attempting to kiss her

was saluted by a spark from her lips. Her little girl on taking hold of the knob of

a door received so severe a shock that she ran off in great fright. Larger children

frequently amused themselves by shuffling about on the carpet and giving each other

sparks from their fingers. The preceding is the most remarkable case I have myself

witnessed ; but I have heard of several other houses in New York which appeared

about equally electrical ; and most of these phenomena have become so familiar in

New York that they have ceased to excite surprise. The electricity thus developed

exhibits the usual phenomena of attraction and repulsion, and is capable of igniting

combustible bodies. By skipping a few times across the room with a shuffling
motion, and then presenting the knuckle to an open gas-burner, the gas may be
ignited. This experiment generally fails unless the burner be warm ; but if after a
jet has been some time burning you extinguish the flame and then draw a spark
with your knuckle from the warm burner, the gas is readily ignited. After a care-

ful examination of several cases of this kind, I have come to the conclusion that the
electricity is excited by the friction of the shoes of the inmates upon the carpets of

the house. I have found by direct experiment, that electricity is developed by the
friction of leather upon woollen cloth. For this purpose I stood upon an insulating
stool, and spreading a small piece of carpeting upon a table before me, rubbed a piece

of leather vigorously upon it ; and then bringing the leather near the cap of a gold-
ieaf electrometer, found that the leaves were repelled with great violenae. The elec-
tricity of the leather was of the resinous kind. Electricity must therefore neces-

sarily be excited whenever a person walks with a shuffling motion across a carpet

but it may be thought remarkable that the electricity should be intense enough

to give a bright spark. In order to produce the highest effect, there must be a

combination of several favourable circumstances. The carpet, or at least its upper

surface, must be entirely of wool and of a close texture. From my own observa-

tions I infer that heavy velvet carpets answer this purpose best. Two thicknesses

pet yields a good supply of electricity. The effect of the increased thickness is
obviously to improve the insulation of the carpet. The carpet must be quite dry,
and also the floor of the room, so that the fluid may not be conveyed away as soon

as it is excited. These conditions will not generally exist except in winter, and in
rooms which are habitually kept quite warm. The most remarkable cases which I

have heard of in New York have been in close, well-built houses, kept verv warm

by furnaces. These furnaces are erected in the cellar and are filled with anthracite
coal, which is kept constantly burning from autumn till spring. The heated air is

conveyed to the hall, the parlours, and to every room in the house, as far as is desired,
through large flues built in the walls, the flues having a section of about one square
foot. In such a house the wood during winter becomes very dry, and all the furni-
ture shrinks and cracks. The electricity is most abundant in very cold weather. In
warm weather only feeble signs of electricity are obtained. The rubber, viz. the
shoe, must also be dry like the carpet, and it must be rubbed upon the carpet some-
what vigorously. By skipping once or twice across a room with a shuflfling motion
of the feet a person becomes highly charged; and then upon bringing the knuckle
near to any metallic body, particularly if it have good communication with the earth,
a bright spark passes. In almost any room which is furnished with a thick woollen
carpet, and is kept tolerably warm and dry, a spark may thus be obtained in winter;

but in some rooms the insulation is so good, and the carpets are so electrical, that it
is impossible to walk across the floor without exciting suiRcient electricity to give a

spark. It may be thought that in walking across a room there is but little friction

between the shoe and carpet, but it should be remembered that the rubber is applied
to the carpet with uncommon force, being aided by the entire weight of the body, so
that a slight shuffling motion of the feet acts with great energy.

Account of an instance of Converging Rays seen at Greenisland, on tJie

  Antrim Shore of Belfast Lough, August 13, 1857. By J. J, Murphy.

 -- --At about 6 P.M., after a thunder-storm which was the second on that day

rainbow was formed. The phenomenon to be described was seen about the left-hand

part of the rainbow. The sky outside the rainbow was of that purple black which
accompanies thunder-storms. Inside it was lighter, and diversified by alternate dark
and bright rays, like those of an aurora, which appeared to converge to a point a

little above the .centre of the rainbow, but below the horizon. These rays fluctuated

like those of an aurora, but much less rapidly, their changes being scarcely quick
enough to be visible. The dark rays extended through the rainbow, almost blotting
it out where they crossed it. The rays were continued outside the rainbow at the

period of their greatest intensity, but not all the time, and were never so distinct
outside as inside. The dark rays were of the same purple black colour as the sky
outside the rainbow; the light rays were like what we call "watery sunshine." This

appearance lasted in all about three-quarters of an hour. The light rays began to

--disappear one by one from the horizon upward, the dark ones being welded toge-

ther into a mass of purple darkness, which, as it ascended, blotted out the rainbow.
In this way the lower part of the rainbow and the rays disappeared. The upper
part of both disappeared by vanishing, the rays being the last completely to disap-
pear. After this, there was some thunder and much rain. Another rainbow w^as
formed during the evening which did not contain any rays, but resembled the former
in having a dark sky outside and a light one inside.

Examination of some Problems of Meteorology. Neiv and complete Explana-

              tion of the Rainbow. By M. l'Abbe Raillard.

   The principal object which I present today, is a new and complete explanation of
the rainbow. I show that the efficient rays of Descartes never enter into the formation
of this phenomenon, but that it is always and solely produced by interferences. I
apply to the rainbow the principle of interferences, not only as Dr. Young has done
it, in his explanations of the supernumerary bows, but according to the much more
exact and complete views of Mr. Airy. Dr. Young preserves in fact to the primary

                                                                                                 3*

bow, a constant radius, while according to that of Mr. Aiiy, it ought to be variable, a

matter which entirely agrees Avith observations made. I have added to my memoir

a drawing, which represents, according to these two theories, the variations which

the rainbow's fringes of interference undergo according to the different diameters of

the drops, from two millimetres to two hundredths of a millimetre, and for the two

extreme colours of the solar spectrum, the red next the ray C, and the violet next the

ray H.

The simply punctuated curves of this drawing give the deviation of the maxima

and minima red and violet of different orders for a given diameter of the drops, the

abscissrc of these curves representing the deviations of the different points of each

fringe ; and the ordinates, the proximate intensities of these points in the theory of
Young. The curves with a full and coloured line represent the real action of the

phenomenon ; they only give the variations of the first two fringes, red as well as
violet, the numerical results of Mr. Airy having only furnished me with means of

cyphering a greater number. But these first two fringes are by far the most import-

ant, and are more than sufficient to fix the real theory of the rainbow, and of all

the variations which it undergoes in its breadth, rav, and the shade of its colours ; as
also the theory of supernumerary bows, the white rainbow, the crowns opposite

the sun, which are nothing else but supernumerary bows, as I demonstrate ; and

finally, to ex|ilain the absence of the coloured rainbow in fogs and rainless clouds.

The relative intensities of the different points of these two fringes are not indicated

in an arbitrary manner by the ordinates of the curves which represent them. I have

determined them as faithfully as I could, making use of the drawings and numbers
published by Mr. Aiiy in his learned " Memoir on the Intensity of Light in the

vicinity of a Caustic."

  The columns of figures contained in my Table give a facility in passing from one
system to another, by means of a formula which I give in my memoir, and from
proportional numbers taken from the memoir of Mr. Airy. The curves may be

multiplied at will by choosing other measures of diameter than those I have given
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

   Instead of a deviation of 42° IG' for the red rays, and 40° 29'for the violet, which the

first maximum should have presented, according to the theory of Descartes and that

of Dr. Young, whatever may be the diameter of the drops, we find for a diameter of

creasing augmentation in the breadth of the first fringe and all the colours, and ends

by their being superposed; such is the cause of the disappearance of the coloured

rainbow in the clouds and fogs, and the origin of the white rainbow which after-

wards disappears.

When the diameter of the globules, of which the fogs are formed, become less than

02 the millimetre, the same Table shows that the conditions favourable to the for-

mation of the white rainbow, is, that the globules of the fogs have a diameter always

between O'l and 0"02 of a millimetre. Moreover, if the diameter does not exceed

0-05 of a millimetre, the colours of all the fringes which follow the first, present

themselves in a bow, from that in which they are produced under the latter, and

give birth to coloured crowns opposite the sun, a phenomenon which up to the pre-
sent time remained unexplained. In support of views purely theoretical, which are
developed at length, I bring first the experiments of Mr. Miller on threads of water
of three different diameters, then the direct observations of Mr. Galle on the rainbow,

afterwards my own experiments on very fine cylindrical threads of a viscous liquid,
and finally, my observations on the coloured rainbows which are seen in cooled water,

or on the irisation of the little cloud formed above hot water.
    All these facts justify, fully and in all its details, the theory which I have pro-

pounded, and clearly show how illusory was the theory of the efficient rays of Des-

cartes ; the latter facts, above all, are a proof of the fallacy of the hypothesis of the
vesicular state. They teach us what is the true constitution of clouds and fogs

whose temperature is beyond zero Centigrade, and it is the only principle of inter-
ferences suitably employed which enabled me to establish it with certainty.

   Towards the close of my memoir, I call the attention of physicists to certain

singular facts, not yet explained, of interferences produced by very thin laminte. I
draw from these facts a most conclusive argument against the explanation which
had been given of the suspension of the clouds by the hypothesis of vesicular vapours.
For this reason, and for all the others which I have deduced against the truly singular
hypothesis of tbe vesicular state, and against that of efficient rays, I dare hope these
two hypotheses will be henceforward banished when teaching the sciences which they
shackled ; that they will never more be called to explain the suspension of clouds, the

colours of the rainbow, the absence of the rainbow in clouds or fogs, but that we
may confine ourselves to the explanations, free from every gratuitous supposition,
which I have now given of these phenomena.

   at Point Barrow, in the Years 1852, 1853, 1854. i?y John Simpson,

   M.D.,R.N., F.R.G.S.

    This communication was brought under the notice of the Section by Prof.
Haughton. The author commenced by saying that his attention was first directed

to the importance of this subject, and he was induced to undertake the laborious task

of hourly observations on the temperature in these regions, by certain remarks of
Sir J.Richardson, at p. 331 of the ninth volume of the Royal Geographical Society's

Journal, 1839, in reference to Sir D. Brewster's discussions of the hourly register
of the temperature at Leith Fort. The author then stated that the observations had
been continued from the 3rd of September, 1852, to the 7th of August, 1853, and
for a few days before and after each of these dates in the neighbourhood, making a
complete year, less 21 days; again, in precisely the same locality, from the 7th of
September, 1853, to the 19th of July, 1854, to Avhich have been added the first six
days of September and one day, the 21st of July, during which the ship was in the
immediate neighbourhood, making a second complete year, less 42 days. The ship
returned to the same spot on the 27th of August, 1854, and remained four whole
days, for which the hourly register gave a mean temperature of 39°"448, serving as

a fair guide for estimating the temperature of the last eleven days of August. He

then touched on the principle of an estimate for filling up the entire interval of twenty-
one days in 1853, and proceeded to describe the instruments used, which were fur-
nished by Adie and Co. of Edinburgh, and which, having been j-eturned to the Hydro-
grapher's office in 1855, could now be re-examined and compared with standards at
Kew. The author then proceeded to give some highly interesting details of the
freezing of the mercurial thermometers, and of the freezing of mercury exposed in open
vessels ; the temperature when it froze seemed about 39°. Prof. Haughton then pro-
ceeded to direct the attention of the Section to several interesting points, selected
from the Journal and Tables, and concluded by describing two large sheets of curves
of mean temperature : Fig. 1 showing the mean daily curve of temperature in the
shade for each month of the year; also the mean daily curve of temperature in the
sun for the month of June. Fig. 2 showed the mean daily curve of temperature for
each season of the year for the summer and winter half-years, and for the whole year

also the mean daily curve of temperature in the sun for forty-two days at Midsum-
mer. The latitude at Point Barrow is 71° 21' North, longitude 156° 17' West.

On the Grand Currents of Atmospheric Circulation.
           By James Thomson, C.E., 3)C.

   In this paper Mr. Thomson brought under the notice of the Section a theory of
the grand currents of atmospheric circulation, which had occurred to him. It has

been ascertained as a matter of observation, that in latitudes extending from about

30° to the poles, the winds, while prevailing from west to east, prevail also in direc-

tions from the equator towards the poles. Now this motion towards the poles ap-

pears not to have been hitherto satisfactorily explained. In fact, it is the contrary

motion to what is naturally to be expected when the theory of Halley, which was

given about the year 1686, and which appears to atford the true key to the explana-

tion of the trade-winds, is followed up with respect to the circulation of the air in
other latitudes than those in which the trade-winds occur. According to this theory

so applied, it would naturally be expected that the air, having risen to the upper

regions of the atmosphere in a hot zone at the equator, should float towards the north

and south polar regions in two grand upper currents, retaining, as they pass to higher

latitudes, some remains, not abstracted by friction and admixture with the currents

below, of the rapid equatorial motion of about 1000 miles per hour from WTst to cast,

which they had in moving with the earth's surface at the equator. Also, it would

be expected that the air in the polar regions should have a prevailing tendency to sink

towards the surface of the earth, in consequence of its increased density caused by

cold ; and that it should tend to flow from the polar regions along the surface of the
earth, towards the equator, with a prevailing motion from west to east in advance of

the earth, until, by friction and impulses on the earth's surface, the motion in ad-

vance of the earth, brought from above by the air in its descent, and communicated

further to it by friction and admixture from above, as it passes to lower latitudes than

its places of descent, is exhausted ; or, in other words, until it reaches the latitude

in which the trade-winds commence to blow from the east; and until it has commu-

nicated, in blowing from west to east on the earth's surface, a torsional force to the

earth, just sufficient to balance the opposite torsional force communicated to the earth

Nowby the trade-winds blowing from east to west.  this theory, obvious as it ap-

pears in the form just adduced, is found in one essential point to be controverted by
observations. This point is what was stated in the outset of the present article,

namely, that the prevailing winds on the surface of the earth in latitudes higher than
30^, are, while blowing from the west, as should be expected, found to blow more
towards the poles than from the poles ; and thus do not move as if impelled along
the surface of the earth from polar to equatorial regions by an augmented pressure
due to condensation by cold in polar regions, and a diminished pressure due to rare-

faction in the equatorial regions. Observations being thus at variance with the only

obvious theory proposed, the circumstance in question has been commonly regarded
as rather paradoxical : and Lieut. Maury, one of the most recent writers on the sub-
ject, has, in his much-valued treatise on the Physical Geography of the Sea, found
himself forced into supposing an entire reversal in latitudes above SC, of the great

circulation just described.

   Mr. Thomson regards I,ieut. Maury's supposition as being entirely unsupported
by the known physical causes of the atmospheric motions. He, on the contrary,

maintains that the great circulation already described does actually occur, but occurs
subject to this modification, that a thin stratum of air on the surface of the earth in

--the latitudes higher than 30° a stratum in which the inhabitants of those latitudes

have their existence, and of which the movements constitute the observed winds of

--those latitudes being, by friction and impulses on the surface of the earth, retarded

with reference to the rapid whirl or vortex motion from west to east of the great mass
of air above it, tends to flow towards the pole, and actually does so flow to supply
the partial void in the central parts of that vortex, due to the centrifugal force of its

revolution. Thus it appears that, in temperate latitudes, there are three currents at

--different heights : that the uppermost moves towards the pole, and is part of a grand
--primary circulation between equatorial and polar regions; that the lowermost moves
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  3Q:.

--also towards the pole, but is only a thin stratum forming part of a secondary circu-

lation ; that the middle current moves from the pole, and constitutes the return cur-

--rent for both the preceding ; and that all these three currents have a prevailing

motion from west to east in advance of the earth. This is the substance of Mr.

--Thomson's theory ; and he gives, as an illustration, the following simple experiment:
    If a shallow circular vessel with flat bottom, be filled to a moderate depth with
water, and if a few small objects, very little heavier than water, and suitable for
indicating to the eye the motions of the water in the bottom*, be put in, and if the
water be set to revolve by being stirred round, then, on the process of stirring being
terminated, and the water being left to itself, the small particles in the bottom will
be seen to collect in the centre. They are evidently carried there by a current deter-
mined towards the centre along the bottom in consequence of the centrifugal force of
the lowest stratum of the water being diminished in reference to the strata above
through a diminution of velocity of rotation in the lowest stratum by friction on the
bottom. The particles being heavier than the water, must, in respect of their den-
sity, have more centrifugal force than the water immediately in contact with them

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

and must therefore in this respect have a tendency to fly outwards from the centre,
but the flow of water towards the centre overcomes this tendency and carries them
inwards; and thus is the flow of water towards the centre in the stratum in contact
with the bottom palpably manifested.

          On the Plasticity of Ice. By .James Thomson, C.E. ^c.

   Mr. Thomson commenced by stating, that to Prof. James Forbes is to be attributed
the discovery that the motion of glaciers down their valleys depends on a plastic or
viscous quality of the ice. He (Mr. Thomson) had formed a theory to explain the
nature of this plasticity, and the manner in which it originates. He had been led to
his speculations on this subject from a previous theoretical deduction at which he
had arrived, namely, that the freezing-point of water, or the melting-point of ice,
must vary with the pressure to which the water or the ice is subjected, the tempera-

ture of the freezing-point being lowered as the pressure is increased. His theory on
that matterf led to the conclusion that the lowering of the freezing-point for one
additional atmosphere of pressure must be 0°"0075 Centigrade, and that the lowering
of the freezing-point corresponding to other pressures must be propoi'tional to the
additional pressure above one atmosphere. The phenomena which he thus predicted,
in anticipation of direct observations, were afterwards fully established by experi-
ments made by his brother. Prof. William Thomson, of which an account was pub-
lished in the ' Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh for February 1850.'
Having thus laid down as a basis the principle of the lowering of the freezing-point
of water by pressure, Mr. Thomson proceeded to oflFer his explanation, derived from

--it, of the plasticity of ice at the freezing-point, as follows : If to a mass of ice at

0° Centigrade, which may be supposed, for the present, to be slightly porous, and to

contain small quantities of liquid water diffused through its substance, forces tend-

ing to change its form be applied, whatever portions of it may thereby be subjected

to compression will instantly have their melting-point lowered so as to be below
their existing temperature of 0° Centigrade. Melting of those portions will therefore
set in throughout their substance, and this will be accompanied by a fall of tempera-
ture in them, on account of the cold evolved in the liquefaction. The liquefied por-
tions being subject to squeezing of the compressed mass in which they originate, will
spread themselves out through the pores of the general mass, by dispersion from the
regions of greatest to those of least fluid pressure. Thus the fluid pressure is relieved
in those portions in which the compression and liquefaction of the ice had set in, ac-

companied by the lowering of temperature. On the removal of this cause of liquidity,

the fluid pressure, namely, the cold, which had been evolved in the compressed parts

  A* few tea-leaves taken from a teapot will suit the purpose well.

   t This theory is to be found in a paper by the author, entitled "Theoretical Considera-
tions on the Effect of Pressure in lowering the Freezing-point of Water," published in the
Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, vol. xiv. part 5, 1S49, and also re-published
in the Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal for Nov. 1850, vol. v. p. 248.

of the ice and water, freezes the water again in new positions, and thus a change of
forra, or plastic yielding of the mass of ice to the applied pressures, has occurred.
The newly-formed ice is at first free from the stress of the applied forces, but the
yielding of one part always leaves some other part exposed to the pressure, and that
part, in its turn, melts and falls in temperature ; and, on the whole, a continual suc-

--cession goes on, of pressures being applied to particular parts liquefaction occurring
--in those parts accompanied by evolution of cold, dispersion of the water so pro-

duced in such directions as will relieve its pressure,-- and re-congelation, by the cold
previously evolved, of the water on its being relieved from this pressure. Tiie cycle
of operations then begins again, for the parts re-congealed, after having been melted,
must, in their turn, through the yielding of other parts, receive pressures from the
applied forces, thereby to be again liquefied, and to proceed through successive ope-
rations as before. The succession of these processes must continue as long as the
external forces tending to change of form remain applied to the mass of porous ice per-
meated by minute quantities of liquid water. The ice is thus shown to be incapable
of opposing a permanent resistance to the pressures, and to be subject to gradual
changes of form while they act on it ; or, in other words, it has been shown to be
possessed of the quality of plasticity. In the foregoing, I have supposed the ice
under consideration to be porous, and to contain small quantities of liquid water dif-
fused through its substance. Porosity and permeation by liquid water are generally
understood, from the results of observations, and from numerous other reasons, to
be normal conditions of glacier ice. It is not, however, necessary for the purposes

myof explanation of the plasticity of ice at the freezing-point, that the ice should be,

at the outset, in this condition ; for even if we commence with the consideration of
a mass of ice perfectly free from porosity, and free from particles of liquid water
diffused through its substance, and if we suppose it to be kept in an atmosphere at
or above 0° Centigrade, then, as soon as pressure is applied to it, pores occupied by
liquid water must instantly be formed in the compressed parts, in accordance with

--the fundamental principle of the explanation which 1 have proposed the lowering,

namely, of the freezing- or melting-point, by pressure, and tlie cognate fact, that ice
cannot exist atO° Centigrade under a pressure exceeding that of the atmosphere. I
would further wish to make it distinctly understood, that no part of the ice, even if
supposed at the outset to be solid, or free from porosity, can resist being permeated

by the water squeezed against it from such parts as may be directly subjected to the
pressure ; because, the very fact of that water being forced against any portions of
the ice supposed to be solid, will instantly subject them to pressure, and so will
cause melting to set in throughout their substance, thereby reducing them imme-
diately to the porous condition. Thus it is a matter of indifference, as to whether
we commence with the supposition of a mass of porous or of solid ice.

   Mr. Thomson then referred to an experiment made by Prof. Christie, late Secre-
tary to the Royal Society, showing the plasticity of ice in small hand specimens,
and also to more recent experiments by Prof. Tyndall to the same effect, and very
interesting on account of the striking way in which they exhibit the phenomena.
He also stated that another very important quality of ice was brought forward by
Faradav in 1850 (see 'AthenfEum,' No 1181). It was that two pieces of moist ice
will consolidate into one on being laid in contact with one another, even in hot wea-

--ther. The theory he had just propounded, he said, afforded a clear explanation of

this fact as follows : The two pieces of ice, on being pressed together at their point
of contact, will, at that place, in virtue of the pressure, be in part liquefied and reduced
in temperature, and the cold evolved in their liquefaction will cause some of the liquid
film intervening between the two masses to freeze. It is thus evident, he added, that
by continued pressure fragmentary masses of ice maybe moulded into a continuous
mass · and a sufficient reason is afl'orded for the reunion, found to occur in glaciers,
of the fragments resulting from an ice cascade, and for the mending of the crevasses or
deep fissures which result occasionally from their motion along their uneven beds.

 Secular Variations in Lunar and Terrestrial Motion from the influence of

            Tidal Action. By D. Vaughan, of Cincinnati, Ohio.

    Laplace eoncludcs from his elaborate investigations, that the rotation of the earth
              TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                 4]

is not affected by the occurrence of the tides ; nor do his formulae reveal anj' perma-
nent alteration in the motion of the lunar orb which disturbs the repose of our oceans.

These results, announced by so high an authority, might be received without a care-

ful examination if the fundamental principles of natural philosophy did not discoun-
tenance the idea of an actual creation of power by lunar attraction. The tides con-

stitute an important mechanical agent ; and, could their whole force be rendered

available, it would be found adequate to several hundred times the labour of the human

population. So great an amount of motive power, whether appropriated to the great

purposes of nature and art, or wasted in overcoming friction, cannot be produced

without some expense j and my present object is to trace the change which it involves

in the motions of the earth and the moon. As the extreme disproportion between the

momentum of the oceanic waters and that of the planetary bodies is the chief source

of error in these investigations, I shall commence by showing how the tidal action

should operate, if the moon moved around the earth in an exact circle, situated in the

plane of the equator, and not more than 34,000 miles in diameter. Her periodical

revolution in this case would occupy nearly twelve hours, and the lunar day would

be about twenty-four hours in length. The tidal action on the seas nearest to the

moon would be almost twice as great as on those most distant ; the former being

about 5000 times, and the latter over 2500 times, the disturbing action now exerted

by the moon on the watery domain. The aqueous appendage of our planet would

in this case form two great moveable oceans, sustained on its opposite sides by the

attraction of our satellite, and keeping pace with her movements. Without taking

into consideration the oscillations of the solid part of the earth which might possibly

occur in these circumstances, it is evident that there should be a general flow of the

waters from west to east ; and though the current may be alternately reversed in deep

channels, the force propelling it in an eastern direction should always maintain the

Aascendency.  vast body of water, circulating around the earth from west to east,

could not fail to accelerate its rotarymotion; although the result would not beexhibited

by the formulae of Laplace. The moon in this case would sustain a loss of momentum

to a more considerable extent. It is well known that the attraction of mountains

modifies the direction of terrestrial gravity in their vicinity ; and that a plumb-line
on that part of the equator immediately west of the Andes would be slightly deflected

to the cast. In the case we have supposed, the direction of terrestrial gravity would

experience a similar deflection at places in conjunction with the moon from the

attraction of the excess of waters which swelled behind her. Accordingly, the lunar

orb would be drav/n, not directly to the earth's centre, but always to a point a little
westward of it, and a constant loss of motion would be an inevitable consequence.

It would be different if the earth could preserve an invariable form, for in that case

its attraction on a satellite being always directed to the centre, or alternately deflected

east and west of that point, the loss and gain of motion should be evenly balanced

Aafter one or manj' revolutions. Other investigations lead to the same conclusion.

satellite revolving just beyond the confines of our atmosphere, would alternately

accelerate and retard the movements of one more distant ; and physical astronomy
shows that in our planetary systems a like periodicity results from the inequality
of the times in which the several planets perform their revolutions. But as the tide-
wave rolls around the earth with the same mean angular velocity as the moon, their

mutual action will not exhibit the periodicity which characterizes planetary disturb-

ances. In the analytical solution of this problem, the equation depending on the

difference of motion of the moon and the tide-wave would acquire by integration a
divisor infinitely small ; and this proves its secular character. If Laplace finds no

such divisors, it is because all the modifications in the action of the moon on the

waters of the ocean are not embraced in his investigations on the subject. Leaving

the supposed case, we shall now pass to the actual condition of the agencies con-

cerned in tidal phenomena on our globe. At her present distance the revolution of

the moon occupies more time than the earth's period of rotation; and the tidal wave

which has the greatest disturbing influence being always east of our satellite, must

Weadd to its velocity, while it retards that of the earth.  may remark, however,

that the additional velocity imparted to the moon would give her a larger orbit, and

increase the period of her revolution. Hence the orbital motion of the moon, as well

as the rotary motion of the earth, sustain a loss depending on the difference of the

tidal force on opposite sides of our globe, and so very insignificant, that some mil-
--42 REPORT 1857.

lions of years would be required to cause a reduction or one per cent, in the momenta
of these vast bodies. I must however question the results of Laplace, who finds that
the change in the length of the day has not amounted to the ^^lyth part of a second
during the last 2000 years. This conclusion is based on a comparison of ancient and
modern eclipses ; and the time of the earth's rotation is thus ascertained from the

revolutions of the moon, making corrections for the disturbances operating on the
latter body. But all the disturbing influences have not yet been taken into considera-
tion; and as the one noticed in the present article operates on the earth and moon,
we cannot regard either of these bodies as ad infallible chronometer for measuring
the vast ages of eternity.

            On the Light of Suns, Meteors, and temporary Stars,

                    By D. Vaughan, Cincimiati, Ohio.

Modern science recognizes shooting-stars, fire-balls, and meteoric stones as bodies

which enter our atmosphere from external space with immense velocities. From the

great elevation at which these objects are luminous, it has been inferred that their

light  has  little  or  no  dependence  on  aerial  action                               and  indeed  the  presence of the  air
                                                                                      ;

alone could not account for the greatness of the illumination which marks their ap-

proach to the earth, but ceases when they enter the dense stratuni«f the atmosphere.
The diameter of many luminous meteors has been estimated .it two or three thousand

feet ; and the globe of light which they exhibited must have been several million times

greater than the largest meteoric stone yet found on the earth's surface. It is sup-

posed that these brilliant exhibitions are produced by cosmical masses several hundred

yards in diameter, which, in traversing the planetary regions, occasionally sweep

through the verge of our atmosphere, and, after casting a few fragments on the earth,

continue their course through space. But the idea tliat such wandering bodies should

graze o\ir planet so often, without ever striking it directly or falling to its surface, is

too extravagant to be seriously entertained, it would be far more likely that, during

a naval engagement, a ship should be almost touched by several thousand balls, with-

out being ever stnick by a single one. Moreover, there is not the slightest evidence

that meteorites ever perform such remarkable feats of precision, or experience so many

narrow escapes from a collision with the earth ; for, instead of being observed depart-
ing into space, they suddenly disappear after their encounter with the air. The small

amount of solid matter which falls to the groimd on these occasions is justly regarded

as inadequate to evolve so vast a body of light by acting on the rarefied air at great

elevations ; but our globe seems to be invested with an atmosphere of aether having far

more wonderful properties. Astronomical investigations prove the existence of a rare

medium pervading all space ; and this subtle fluid cannot be wholly insensible to che-

mical forces, which alone could render it useful in nature's economy. Extreme rai'ity

would, indeed, prevent it from undergoing any chemical change in the interplanetary
regions ; but it is com])ressed to a much greater density about the vast spheres by

which space is tenanted. The atmospheres of this fluid enveloping the earth and the

other large planets, are not sufficiently dense for chemical action, except in cases

where they receive an additional pressure from meteoric bodies sweeping through

them with wonderful rapidity. The evolution of light on such occasions depends, not

only on the size and velocity of the falling mass, but also on the direction in which it

approaches the planetar}' surface; and observation shows that the most brilliant meteors
move very nearly parallel to the horizon. But around the sun a much stronger attract-

ive force gives this ethereal fluid the compression necessary for a constant c'lemical

action, and a steady development of light; while the realms of sp.ace furnish inex-

haustible supplies of the luciferous matter, and impart perpetual brilliancy to the great

luminary of our system. It is not possible that the self-luminous condition of the sun

could be maintained by any combustible, or light-yielding matter ; of which it is com-
posed. From a comparison of the relative intensity of solar, lunar, and artificial

light, as determined by Euler and Wollaston, it appears that the rays of the sun have

an illuminating power equal to that of 14,000 candles, at a distance of one foot; or

of 3500,000000,000000,000000,000000 candles, at a distance of 95,000,000 miles.

be consumed every ten years in maintaining its wonderful brilliancy, and its atmo-

sphere, if pure oxygen, would be expended before a few days in supporting so great

a conflagration.

   An illumination on so vast a scale could be kept up only by the inexhaustible

niagazine of aether disseminated through space, and ever ready to manifest its luci-

ferous properties on large spheres, whose attraction renders it sufficiently dense for

the play of chemical affinity. Accordingly, suns derive the power of shedding per-

jietual light, not from their chemical constitution, but from their immense mass and

Wetheir superior attractive power.     thus obtain some definite knowledge respecting

tile stupendous magnitude of the fixed stars; and making due allowance for their
density, we may confidently pronounce the smallest stellar body several thousand

times greater than the globe we inhabit. This theory gives considerable support to
tlie views which many astronomers maintain, on different grounds, in regard to the

relative brilliancy of the stars ; for it appears that, though the self-luminous occupants
of space are not necessarily equal in size, they differ much less than we might anti-
cipate from an acquaintance with the members of our planetary system. That the

light of the sun is furnished, not by its solid or liquid matter, but by its luminous

atmosphere, has been proved very conclusively from the observations with Arngo's

polarizing telescope. There is also evidence that this luciferous envelope is constantly
replenished by supplies of a;ther from space. The sun's rotation assists in effecting this

object by expelling the fluid from its equatorial regions, and thus creating a corre-

Asponding influx at its poles.  displacement by this means would evidently cause

tlie solar atmosphere to advance constantly from its poles to its equator ; and such a
movement is indicated by the change in the position of the sun's spots, which, accord-
ing to the observations of Peters for many years, are continually diminishing their

heliocentric latitude. The progressive motion of the solar orb tl)rough space tends

also to replenish its atmosphere with fresh material for the maintenance of its light;

and the position of the large planets has some influence on the amount of tether which

it receives from the celestial domain. The periodicity observed in the solar spots,
and some changes exhibited by many variable stars, may be ascribed to an eflbct of

this kind. But the result would be far more decided if a sun had large planets in its

immediate vicinity ; for the attraction of these bodies would alter the pressure on its

sethereal atmosphere, and produce a corresponding variation in the development of its

light. On this principle we may explain several phenomena connected with the vari-
able stars ; and I may remark, that Argelander regards many of their peculiarities as

indicating, that planets revolving around some suns affect the generation of light in

their photospheres. But a planet revolving in an orbit of the smallest size possible

would be productive of more remarkable consequences. Sweeping through the ethe-

real atmosphere of the great central sphere, it would impart a sufficient degree of

pressure for luciferous action ; and exhibit, on a grand scale, the evolution of light
which accompanies the visits of meteoric masses to the earth. From the great bril-
liancy of meteors which move in a horizontal direction, it is evident that a satellite

revolving around a large globe, at a small distance above its surface, should be favoured

with all the conditions necessary for  a sublime meteoric illumination                                                                                                                                              and  it is pro-

bable that some of the bright tenants of space may shine by light originating from

such a cause. Indeed, the resistance of the space-pervading medium must constantly

diminish the orbits of all satellites, and, after innumerable years, bring them into

such a proximity with their central bodies that such gi-and meteoric phenomena would

be almost inevitable. If space contain dark systems (as is generally believed), the

central orb which presides over each of them would become luminous, when one of
its planets was passing through the final state of existence.

    In a paper read at the last meeting of the American Association for the Advance-

--ment of Science, and published in the ' Proceedings ' (pp. 1 1 1 113), I Ivave shown

that the stability of satellites could no longer exist if their orbits were reduced to a
certain limit; and that the attraction of the primary body would render them inca-
pable of preserving a planetary form. In like manner, a member of one of the
dark systems of space, wlien brought too near its central orb, would be likewise
doomed to suffer a dismemberment; and the fragments resulting from the mighty
wreck would immediately scatter into separate orbits. Instead, therefore, of closing

its planetary career as one vast meteor, the attendant should form a host of meteoric
masses, and thus send forth far greater floods of light into space. But the frag-

meiits, gradually assuming; circular orbits, would ultimately form a ring similar
to that around Saturn ; and as this change advanced, the light should constantly de-
cline until it ceased when tlie aHher partook of the motion of tlie fragmentary host,
and became almost insensible to their pressure. It is to occurrences of this kind,
which must occasionally lake place in the wide domains of creation, that wc may
ascribe the aj)pearance of temporary stars, and in doing so, we obtain a satisfactory
explanation of the various ])eculiarities which they exhibit. The existence, on our
own sphere, of the ttlher which acts so important a part in the scene of celestial won-

der's is indicated by certain tlectrical i)henomena. On its presence seems to depend
the evolution of light attending the passage of electricity through the vacuum of an

exhausted receiver, and the light of the aurora borealis appears to be evolved by
electric action from the rethereal fluid, which arrives at the polar regions from space.
It is only by this hypothesis that we can account for the effect of a shooting-star
during an aurora, in lighting up certain parts of the vaults of heaven not previously
illuminated (see Humboldt's ' Cosmos' on Aerolites). It thus appears that the subtle
medium which fdls space is not to be regarded as a mere impediment to planetary
motion, but as a useful agent in the course of Nature's o))erations, and as indispensable
to our existence as the appendages of air and water which roll around our planet.

     On the Condition of Thames Water, as affected by London Sewage.

            By R. Barnes, 3I.D. and \\\ Odling, 3I.B., F.C.S.

   The authors had, for a period of nearly six months, made consecutive weekly
examinations, microscopical and chemical, of Thames water, taken at high and low
tide from the middle of the stream at Greenwich. From their experiments it appeared
that the pouring in of the contents of drains did not afiect Thames water so seriously
as was generally considered, inasmuch as the greater part of the sewage become de-
stroyed'by the innoxious processes of oxidation and vital development, while only a
small portion underwent tlie process of putrefaction, properly so called. The amount
of organic matter present did not appear to be any criterion of the offensiveness of
the water, seeing that it existed for the most part in the state of living organisms.
The authors found invariably a greater amount of organic matter in high, than in
low Avater.

              On Urea as a Direct Source of Nitrogen to Vegetation.
                          By Charles A. Cameron, 31.D.

   The author showed that nitrogen was as available as food for plants, when a con-
stituent lor lU'ea, as in its ammoniacal combination ; or, in other words, that urea,
without being converted into ammonia, may be taken up into the organisms of plants,
and there supply the necessary cpianfity of nitrogen. He described the experiments
which led him to this conclusion, which were very elaborate, and were made on barley
plants grown in non-nitrogenous soils, and in confined spaces supplied with air freed

--from ammonia. The following conclusions were dtducible from the results of his

experiments, viz. 1. That the perfect development of barley can take place, under

certain conditions, in soil and air destitntc of ammonia and its compounds. 2. That
urea in solution is capable of being taken unchanged into the organisms of plants.
3. That urea need not be converted into ammonia before its nitrogen becomes avail-
able for the purposes of vegetation. 4. That the fertilizing effects of urea are not at
all inferior to those of the salts of ammonia. Ci. That there exists no necessity for
allowing drainings or other fertilising substances containing urea to ferment ; but that,
on the contrary, greater benefits must be derived from their application in the recent
or unfermented condition.

 On a Method of Hefining Sugar. By Professor Daubeny, M.D., F.R.S.

    Dr. Daubeny gave an account of a new method of refining sugar, conducted at
Plj'mouth by Mr. Oxland, and known by his name. It consists in the adoption of the

superphosphate of alumina in conjunction with animal charcoal, as a substitute for the
albumen usually employed for that purpose. In both cases the object is to separate
and carry down the various impurities, which colour and adulterate the pure saccha-
rine prinriple, present in the syrup expressed from the cane or other vegetable which
supplies it. As, however, bullocks' blood is the material usually procured for the pur-
poses of supplying the albumen, a portion of uncoagulated animal matter, togetlier

--with certain salts, is left in the juice in the ordinary process of refining, which impairs

its purity, and promotes its fermentation thus occasioning a certain loss of saccha-
rine matter to result. Nothing of the kind happens wlien the superphosphate is
substituted, and so much more perfect a purification of the feculent matters, under
such circumstances, takes place, that several varieties of native sugar, which, froni
being very highly charged with feculent matters, would be rejected in the ordinary
process of refining, are readily purified by this method. The employment of super-

phosphate of alumina also gets rid of so much larger a proportion of the impurities
present in the sugar, that much less animal charcoal is subsequently required for
effecting its complete defecation, than when bullocks' blood has been resorted to.

'J'he quantity of superphosphate necessary for eftecting the object is, for ordinary
sugars, not more than twelve ounces to the ton ; whereas, for the same quantity, as

much as from one to four gallons of bullocks' blood is found to be required. Dr.
Daubeny suggested that this reagent might be advantageously resorted to, not only
in the purification of sugar, but also in other processes of the laboratory, when the
removal of foreign matters, intimately mixed with the solution of a definite compound,
becomes a necessary preliminary to its further examination.

                    On the Conversion of Paper into Parchment.

                    By Professor Daubeny, M.D., F.R.S.

   Dr. Daubeny exhibited some specimens of paper that had been converted into parch-
ment. The discovery,he believed, had originated in the experiments made in connexion
with the manufacture of gun-cotton, as it was accidentally discovered, when dipping
paper into nitric acid, that the same effect was not exercised upon it as upon the cotton,
but that it was rendered tough. The alteration visible in the conversion of common
paper into parchment after being dipped into weak sulphuric acid, is believed to be
attributable to the substitution of an atom of water for an atom of hydrogen.

tic nomenclature for organic compounds, is a modification of that employed by Ger-

stances in a number of groups or families, the individual members of each of which
have analogous relations to each other. "The relations existing between the various

groups can be most easily explained by comparing corresponding terms of each. For

not rceoramended by being already partially in use amongst chemists. It is evident

that the system of nomenclature proposed is very far from complete : it is intended
only as a suggestion of the way in which a more complete system might be formed.

         On some Arseniates of Ammonia. By Alphonse Gages.

   After mentioning the arseniates of ammonia already described by Berzelius and Mit-

schcrlich, and noticing the imperfect description given in books about the processes
for preparing the salts of aitimonia and arsenic acid, and the doubtful character of
their constitution, the author described his own experiments, which verified the
constitution of the salts mentioned by Berzelius and Mitscherlich : he found, how-
ever, that the salt containing three equivalents of ammonia described by the former,

contains seven equivalents of hydrated water. He described three new double salts,

formed by avsciiiate of ammonia, in which soda, potash, &c. act as the second bases.

He also exhibited some beautifully crystallized compounds of arsenic acid, with mor-
phia and quinine, which may probably be of interest as therapeutical agents.

gen dissolves in absolute alcohol without decomposition, but if the solution be allowed

to stand for a few hours it decomposes. He described an apparatus for introducing

the chloride of nitrogen into the alcohol, and mentioned the character of the reaction
which took place.

  --2. On Frolli. Some licjnids wlien sliakeii wilb air form a more ov less permanent

frotli. Aqueous solutions of organic bodies are jieculiarly disposed to do so. The

frothing of beer is due originally in a great measure to the carbonic acid that rises

through the liquid, but its persistence is quite independent of that or any other dis-

solved gas, as was proved by exhausting some beer by an air-punij), and afterwards

shaking it. Acetates are much given to making a permanent froth when dissolved

in water, whether the solution contain air or not yet acetic acid itself is not remark-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

ai)lc for this quality, and alcohol or rctlier forms bubbles when shaken which instantly

disappear. The power of producing a persistent froth appears to be a specific quality

not depending on the density of the liquid or any other knovrn property. The colour

of froth is always lighter than that of the liquid from v/hich it is produced, and in

some cases it is totally difterent. The author showed that this was due to the dichro-

niatisni  of  such  liquids                                 for  instance,  a  thin  stratum  of cochineal  transmits  rays

colourless bubble that floats on port wine was explained by a prismatic analysis.

          On the Deconipodtion hy Heat of certain Ammoniacal Salts.
                      By J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.R.S.

   The author showed that the decomposition of phosphate and sulphate of ammonia by
a strong heat was not entirely owing to the non-volatility, unless at a very high tempera-
tui-e, of phosphoric and sulphuric acids. In fact these salts arc decomposed partially
when their solutions are boiled, ammonia being given of!', and the remaining liquor
becoming acid. In like manner oxalate of ammonia is capable of decomposition, and

crystals of the citrate give off the volatile alkali even at the ordinary temperature,

acquiring at the same time an acid reaction. It was noticed that the ammonia salts
of the monobasic hydrochloric and nitric acids are not decomposable by water, while
the compounds of the bibasic, oxalic, and sulphuric acids are liable to partial decom-
position, and those of the tribasic, phosphoric, and citric acids are still more easily
resolved into free ammonia and acid salts.

                  On the Use of the Prism in detecting Impurities.
                     By J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.R.S.

   This paper described the novel use of the prism in detecting imprn'ities. The author
described the methods of examining substances by means of a prism, especially the
instructive results obtained with liquids when the ray of light traverses them in a
wedge-shaped vessel. lie suggested this as a means of detecting coloured impurities
when they do exist, and of proving their absence when they are wrongfully suspected.

He showed the value of the means in respect to coloured confectionery, tea, and mus-

tard, and remarked on its use in examining wines, liqueurs, pigments used in the fine

arts, gems, pharmaceutical preparations, &c. He stated that the prism and hollow

wedge were already used as a commercial means of ascertaining the purity of certain

 substances.

                   On Electrical Currents in the Earth's Sxirface.
                         By Archibald H. Hamilton.

     In the spring of the present year, the author had occasion to try a series of experi-
 ments on n diflicult point, namely, the nature of the earth as a conducting body.
 Having selected six convenient stations, represented in the diagram, he buried dif-
 ferent metallic bodies in those marked A, 13, C, D, and wooden boxes, filled with
 water, in which metal plates were to be plunged, at stations No. 1 and No. 2 ; these
 stations were connected by wires sufficiently insulated to convey currents of a single
 cell, without sensible loss in ordinary weather.

    On the evening of April 20, 1857, about G'30 p.m., he proceeded to make some
 observations with a small galvanometer. He first connected a brass plate in box No. 1
 with the brasses buried at A and B, and found a strong deflection, arising as it were
 Afrom x'lnc plates at and B. He then took down the galvanometer to C, and con-
 nected by its wire the plates buried at C with a zinc plate plunged in No. 2, and

observed that, instead of a current ffowing from the less oxidable metals (Cu+ 1 Sn)

into the more oxidable (Zn), there was a strong current flowing/row the zinc into the
copper and tin plates buried at C.

This unlooked-for current, by stopping the source of his motive power (for there
was no battery-power to be used in these experiments), forcibly diverted his attention
from the original experiments,
                                to the examination of this new and curious phenomenon
He accordingly endeavoured,     by enlarging the number of the stations, &c., and espe-

cially by usuig wooden boxes or porous earthen vessels buried in the ground and open
at the top, and plates of the same metal, numbered for identification, and iniercha?iged

as frequently as possible, to obtain some rudiments of laws for these curious currents.
Owing to the difficulties of the experiments, and the incompleteness of the apparatus'
the followmg results are presented merely as agreeing with the general tenor of the'
observations, and affording a basis for laws to be deduced from more extended and
accurate experiments.

    1. There will be, almost always, a current flowing  along an insulated wire,                               joini'no"-
two plates of the same metal, shnilarly buried in the   surface of the earth.

2. The direction and strength of this current depend upon the titne of the day, the
season, the year, &c., and seem to be functions of the azimuth of the straight' line

joining the centres of the buried plates.

   3. The strength of the current seems also to be a function of the letinth of this

straight line.

   4. There will generally be at least one neutral hne in which buried plates will be
inactive; this line the author thinks the magnetic meridian of the place will be found

to be.

5. As to the siffn of the current along the wire, the author is quite at a loss to
account for its very curious changes from
                                           one  time  to another                                         nor,  knowing its sign

at any one moment in the wire, can he say what is most likely to be its sign at that
moment in the earth, not having been able to complete a series of chemical experi-
ments begun for that purjiose.

On some Modified Results attending the Decomposition of Bituminous Coals
                  by Heat. By Dr. A. A. Hayes, United States.

   When bituminous coal is exposed in proper vessels to a gradually increasing teni'

perature, at a certain point decomposition commences and continues, while heavy
hydrocarbon vapours, mixed with the vapours of water and salts of ammonia, escape,
and may be condensed.

   The proportion of permanent gases formed is small in comparison with the weight
of the liquids produced, when the decomposition of the coal is carefully regulated.

    In the ordinary rapid breaking up of the composition of coal by heat suddenly
applied in the manufacture of illuminating gas, the proportion of permanent gases is
increased, but tlie heavy fluid hydrocarbons are also formed. This mode of decom-
position is evidently a mixed one, partaking of the characters of a regulated distilla-
tion, while at the same moment a more complete destruction of the coal is proceeding

in some parts of the mass.

   A further decomposition of the fluid products, condensed from either or both of

these modes of operating, takes place when we again subject them to the influence of

--heat; and this well-known fact is the basis on which improvements in the manufac-

ture of illuminating gas have been founded, a secondary destruction of vapours being
elFeeted in appropriate apparatus, heated to a high temperature.

    This character, which all the bituminous coals exhibit, of passing into carbon nearly
free from vapours only when heavy fluid hydrocarbons are also formed, has, in a che-
mical view, been the strongest fact adduced in opposition to the generally received
opinion that the anthracites and semi-anthracites have i-esulted from chemical changes
of bituminous coal, through the agency of the heat of igneous rocks which have dis-
turbed their beds. The heavy hydrocarbons, represented by ordinary coal-tar, are
the most indestructible bodies known ; and wherever anthracites exist, we should
expect to find near those products of the chemical changes effected in the coal.-
Such is the delicacy of the balance existing between the elements of the heavy hydro-
carbons, that no second distillation of them can be effected ; they always undergo
decomposition by heat, with the separation of carbon, which, under any known natu-
ral conditions, would remain to attest their previous presence.

   Considerations of this kind have led me to experiment on tlie changes which coals

undergo by heat, where the influencing conditions were not the same as those usually
seen ; and the results of extended trials demonstrate that the bituminous coals may
be broken up into permanent gases, vapours of water, and ammoniacal salts, while
carbon remains as a fixed product.

    If we substitute, for the ordinary forms of apparatus used in decomposing coal by
heat suddenly applied, any modification of form which compels the gas, as it forms,
to escape from the more highly heated part of the mass of coal, through a small open-
ing, or, better, a small eduction-pipe, the heavy hydrocarbons do not form part of the
products which escape. Generally the light, nearly colourless oils of the benzole
series appear with the aqueous solutions of the ammoniacal salts, while only an acci-
dental quantity of carbon is deposited in the eduction-pipe. The carbon left is more
than usually compact and hard ; and such coals as ordinarily produce much water,
when they form heavy hydrocarbons, afford less than half the usual amount, when
thus decomposed, under the influence of the constant presence of an atmosphere of

permanent gases.
    In following the observations at the earlier stage, it was found that the size of the

eduction-tube leading the gas from the hotter part of the mass of coal undergoing
changes, exerted a most marked effect on the composition of the products. It was
established as a fact, that in an ordinary coal-gas retort, the size of the conduit might
be varied so as to allow the tar-like bodies to form, or to prevent their appearance at

pleasure.

   But a more remarkable result was obtained, when, after having prevented the pro-
duction of heavy hydrocarbon fluids, the influence of reduced size of tube was studied
in its relation to the composition of the gas afforded by a particular kind of coal. To
a certain extent, the chemical constitution of the gas formed was found to be under
control, and the conclusion reached was, that dissimilar permanent gases may be thus
obtained from the same parcel of coal without a modification of temperature.

   Any explanation of the change of composition induced in the volatile parts of
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                           51

bituminous coals under the above-described conditions should not include mechanical
pressure, which is no greater than often exists in ordinary cases.

    It seems probable that the presence of an atmosphere of nearly permanent gases in
the decomposing vessel, and the regular continuous flow of them from the coal, pre-
vent the formation of heavy vapours at the instant of change in the coal. In support
of this point, we find the temperature necessary to convert coal into gas without the
presence of heavy hydrocarbons much less high than when they are produced.

  We may therefore observe the decomposition of coal without the simultaneous

formation of tar, and beds of coal may be converted under existing natural conditions

to anthracite without secondary products being formed.

                  On a new Method of administering Chloroform.
By M. LE Baron Heurteloup. {Communicated by M. l'Abbe Moigno.)

Tliis method consists in projecting the chloroform by means of a simple apparatus

composed of a small pair of bellows, to which is adjusted a sort of glass syringe. The

latter is a small hollow glass tube having a cork at each end ; at the further extremity

is fixed a metallic tube of a conical shape terminating in a point, through the other

cork passes another metallic tube communicating with the bellows by means of an
Aindia-rubber tube.
                     given quantity of cliloroform is introduced into the syringe on

a piece of gauze ; a slight movement of the bellows drives out the chloroform against

the mouth and nose of the patient. In this manner the autlior can regulate the in-

halation of the chloroform, and, moreover, the persons present are not so much affected

by its vapours as when it is administered in the ordinary manner.

               On illuminating Peat Gas. By R. L. Johnson.

   The author stated that it is now nearly half a century since a Parliamentary Com-
mittee appointed by Government to report on Irish peat named the town of Sl'igo and
the Hill of Howth as the extreme points of a straight line, and Galway and Wicklow
Mead as the extreme points of another straight line, between which two right lines lay

the six-sevenths of all the peat in Ireland, the remaining one-seventh being distri-
buted throughout localities on either side of these lines. Having named the different
localities where peat is distributed, the total quantity of which in superficial acres
appears to be three millions, Mr. Johnson entered into a detailed description of the

mode by which he obtained illuminating gas from common peat or turf, which he pro-
duced by the double decomposition of the constituents of the peat. He stated that
works for the production of the gas have been recently erected and are in actual opera-
tion in two places in Ireland. In the Queen's County and County Westmeath, the
gas produced was good, and its cost, as stated to him by a gentleman who was using
it, less than 2s. the thousand cubic feet. He stated that from one single pound weight
of common peat an hour's light may be produced, that its cost being so very small
it should ultimately be extensively used throughout Ireland, and that in all peat

countries also in its production there was a residual of charcoal equal to one-third of
the peat employed.

Notice of Researches on the Assimilation of Nitrogen by Plants.

           By Messrs. Lawes, Gilbert, and Pugh.

Whether or not plants can assimilate the free nitrogen of the atmosphere, is in a

purely scientific point of view, a question of high interest; and, if answered in the

affamative, will add a striking fact to the history both of nitrogen itself, and of the

Avegetative functions.  true theory of many agricultural facts and practices requires

a definitive solution of this debated point. The earlier writers supposed that the free

nitrogen of the air could be taken up by plants. De Saussure and others came to an

opposite conclusion ; and this latter view has been pretty generally adopted by scientific
oDscrvers. M. Boussingault in particular, adduced experimental evidence to show,

that plants do not assimilate the free nitrogen of the air. But, during the last few

years, an extensive and elaborate series of investigations has been made by Mons. G.

Ville of Paris, the results of which led him to conclude, that plants sometimes assimi-

late a considerable amount of free nitrogen. M. Boussingault has followed up the

inquiry in various ways, and still maintains the opposite opinion. It is hence highly

                                                                   4.*

desirable that others should undertake the subject ; and it was the plan adopted by
the authors to this end, and the indications so far obtained, that they now brought
before the Section. They described the several methods adopted by M, Boussin-
gault and M. Ville respectively, and then illustrated by drawings their own methods
and progress. In all cases their plants grew, in the first instance, in soil and atmo-
sphere destitute of all combined nitrogen, except that contained in the seed sown. To
some, however, as their growth seemed to indicate the need, for the sake of compa-
rison, small and known quantities of ammonia (as sulphate), were supplied. Draw-
ings of the progress of the plants showed a very considerable increase of growth where
this ammoniacal supply was given. In some of these cases, the plants promised to
yield seed, and their height and general development was pretty natural. In other
instances, where only the combined nitrogen of the seed sown, and the free nitrogen
of the air, were available, the plants remained exceedingly small, and withered before
coming to perfection. The quantitative result could not, however, be known, until
the growing plants, the soil, and the pots in which they grew, were analysed ; when
the debtor and creditor account, so to speak, of the nitrogen, could be made up. Col-
lateral researches were briefly described, the object of which was, to throw light on
the relation of the gases evolved during the growth of plants, to constituents actually
assimilated ; and also others, to show whether free nitrogen was a product of the
decomposition of organic matters under certain circumstances.

On the Chemical Composition of an ancient Iron Slag found at Lochgoilhead,

ByArgyleshire.  John J. J. Kyle, Assistant in Chemistry, Surgeons^

Hall, Edinburgh. (^Communicated by Dr. Stevenson Macadam,

F.R.S.E.)

This paper had reference to a discovery made by the author, during the autumn of

185G, of a quantity of iron scoria or furnace slag, as also portions of charcoal, and

other remains indicative of the existence, at some remote period, of an ancient iron
work or " Bloomei-j'" on the shores of Loch Goil in Argyleshire. The slag referred

to, which the author has subjected to analysis, yielded him the following results :

Silicic acid         29-60

Alumina              5*60

Lime                 2-80

Magnesia             3*72

Protoxide of iron    56*52

Sulphide of calcium  1-00

                                                                                               10000
   Referring to the large amount of protoxide of iron entering into the composition
of the slag, the author stated his belief that the process of manufacture adopted in
this bloomery was in all probability that known as the direct or Catalan process, in
which the ore is reduced by the action of the fuel, without the intervention of any
flux, and giving rise to the formation of a silicate of iron, which from its great fusi-
bility woiUd readily admit of being run off at a comparatively low temperature. It
having been long remarked that ancient scorite found on elevated positions almost in-
variably contained a large proportion of iron, whilst those found on less exalted dis-
tricts had but little of that metal in their composition, it had hence been inferred that
the former indicated the more ancient seats of the iron manufacture, as, prior to the
introduction of bellows as a means of forcing air into the burning fuel, open and ex-
posed situations would be best adapted for furnace operations, seeing that the natural
currents of air could have more ready access to the combustible than in sheltered
localities ; although even by the adoption of this expedient, the operators of these early
times would be unable to command a temperature sufficiently intense to enable them
to employ a flux such as lime, with the view of removing the silicic acid of the ore,
owing to the difficultly fusible nature of the calcareous silicate thus formed. From
the preceding considerations the author drew the inference that the Loch Goil bloomery
was one of the most ancient in the kingdom, remarking that in this view he was borne
out by the nature of the position where the remains were discovered, it being one
which, although at no great elevation, was yet freely exposed to the sudden and high

winds almost constantly sweeping through the glen. In conclusion, he stated ihat
he had as yet been unable to prove the existence of any natural cliposits of iron ore
in the vicinity of Loch Goil, but intended to examine the locality more fully on an
early occasion.

was fovmd to be

Dissolving the metal in dilute muriatic acid, precipitating with ammonia, weighing

the precipitate, and calculating from the results, and from the above composition of

the crude metal, the weight of pure alumina yielded by a given weight of pure alumi-

nium was found, and hence the equivalent of the element. The number deduced

from one experiment, out of four made, differed so seriously from that given by the

other three, that the investigation must be looked upon as still quite incomplete. The

apparent cause of the discrepancy was pointed out ; namely, the retention by alumina

of a small amount of water at even a very high temperature. The importance of a

speedy revision of the atomic weight of aluminium was insisted upon, the method by

which the number now admitted was obtained being noticed as ill-suited to give an

accurate result.  ^_______

           On the Melting-points of Bodies, By Dr. Miall.

           Notices of Photography. By M. l'Abbe Moigno.

The Abbe Moigno presented, in the name of M. Bertsch, ' Microscopic Photo-

graphs;' in the name of Mr. Bingham, ' Improved Photographic Copies of Oil Paint-
ings ;' and in the name of M. Niepce de St. Victor, A' perfectly New Metliod of exhi-

biting, by means of Photography, the Phosphorescence and Fluorescence of Bodies.'

There are two methods of rendering evident this new action of light upon bodies

submitted to its influence. The first consists in the exposure to light of an engraving

which has been kept in a dark place, and which after exposure is placed upon a sheet

of photographic paper. After twenty-four hours' contact the engraving leaves its
image upon the latter, the black parts of the drawing making a white expression

on a dark ground. In this experiment the engraving may be replaced by any

other body : wood, paper, ivory, porcelain, &-c., all act more or less in the same

manner. If the intei-ior of an opake metallic tube closed at one end and lined with

paper or card-board, be exposed to the sun for about an hour, and then taken into a

dark room, it leaves the impression of its circular orifice on photographic paper ; and
if after exposure its extremity be closed and sealed up, the interior will preserve its
radiating power for a considerable length of time, and will act on photographic paper

on being opened.

as sulphate of quinine, &c., and exposed to the sun, prints itself on photographic

--54 REPORT 1857.

quinine has not been exposed to light, it pi-oduces no effect on the photographic paper.

Other substances act as sulphate of quinine.

   The second method of rendering palpable this peculiar action of light is as follows :
" I take," says M. Niepce, " a sheet of paper which has been kept for some time in
complete darkness; I cover it with a photographic print taken either on glass or paper,

and I expose them to the rays of the sun, after which I immediately carry my sheet
back into a dark room. Taking off my photographic print, I plunge my sheet of

paper into a solution of nitrate of silver; in a very short space of time the image of
the print appears upon it. It is only necessary to wash the sheet in water to fix
permanently the impression thus obtained. To obtain a more perfect impression,

and one, moreover, produced in a still shorter space of time, it is necessary that the

sheet of paper be previously impregnated with one of those substances which possess,
to a great degree, the faculty of absorbing light. The most efficacious is perhaps a
solution of nitrate of urane or tartaric acid. The image obtained by the medium of

these substances is of a chestnut colour. To render it black, it may be treated with
chloride of gold. The prints thus obtained are positives; they resist the destructive
action of boiling cyanide of potassium, ammonia, &c. ; aqua regia alone destroys them,

A slight degree of heat accelerates the above phenomena."

   The author has experimented with a great number of absorbing substances and
with very varied effects. He is still occupied with these interesting researches.

      On Three New Electrotype Processes. By M. l'Abbe Moigno.

   The first of these improved processes consisted in the employment of platina wires
instead of copper, and of making a skeleton figure resembling roughly the outline of
the cast sought to be obtained, by means of which, according to M. Lenoir's process,
busts, statues and groups can be produced in full relief by a single operation. The
second of these consisted in M. Oudry's process for galvanizing or coppering iron and
cast iron to any thickness required without the cyanide bath, with remarks upon its
employment in commerce and in the navy. The process was not fully communicated,
as it is commercially desirable to keep it a secret ; but sufficient was communicated to
show that the cyanide bath, which is not only expensive but dangerous, can be dis-
pensed with, and the present system, according to which there was a great waste of
material, avoided, although the substance that was placed upon the iron to induce the
deposit of the copper was not stated. The process essentially consists in depositing
by electricity, copper in a pure state, to any thickness, upon articles of cast, wrought,
or rolled iron, zinc and other metals, and alloys of metals, after being coated with one

or several coats of a composition in a liquid or semi-liquid state, serving as an isolating

and metallizing medium. The author claims also as his invention the application to
metallic articles, compositions, paints or varnishes of any kind to act as protective
intermediates, before depositing on them the required thickness of copper, by means
of the galvanic battery. The last branch of the paper treated of Messrs. Christofe
and Bonillet's process for strengthening electrotypes, the principle of which was to
leave an opening in the back of the thin electrotype obtained by precipitating, and
to put into it various little pieces of brass, Vy'liich, on being melted with an oxy-
hydiogen blast, became diffused all over the interior surface of the copper without
injiniiig it in any way, and therebjf imparted to it the strength of cast iron.

On the Choice of Perennial rather than Annual Fertilizers.

Belfast forty years ago. One of these mere trials, with vitriolized bones, yielded

luxuriant crops in June 1808. Long-continued experiments h;iving now convinced

him that the soluble biphosphates were in fact too soluble, he had turned his attention

               On Coloured Confectionary. By Dr. M'Namara.

   The author drew the attention of the Section to the large quantity of highly poisonous
colouring matters employed in the manufacture of confectionary. He referred to cases
of deaths resulting from this practice. He alluded to the manner in which these sub-
stances might be coloured by vegetable colouring materials of a harmless nature, and
suggested that a list of such colours should be compiled by parties competent to the
task, from which alone confectioners should be permitted to select their colours. He
gave a sketch of such a list, and exhibited some beautifully coloured confectionary, in
which such colouring matter had been employed. These confections he had for some
time in his possession, and their colours did not appear to have faded. In conclusion,
he cautioned the public against buying any confectionary in which green or blue
colours exist, as such colours are probably produced by poisonous agencies.

  On the Effects of Alum in Panification. By W. Odling, M.B., F.C.S.

    The author maintained that during the process of making fermented bread, in
addition to the fermentation of some of the sugar of the wheat into alcohol and car-
bonic acid, another species of fermentation or change most frequently took place, which
consisted in a transformation of the starch into dextrine or sugar, and occurred to the
greatest extent in flour that had undergone a damp harvesting, in some cases even to
such an extent as to prevent altogether the production of a presentable loaf, save by the
use of alum or some such agent. It appeared that alum exerted very little effect upon
the necessary fermentation of the sugar into carbonic acid and alcohol, but that it
impeded very greatly, or altogether prevented, the conversion of the starch into sugar.
It was found that dough having of itself a tendency to undergo this saccharine change,
or having the tendency induced by means of an infusion of malt, yielded loaves that
were dark-coloured, sodden, sticky, sweet, and uneatable ; while the same dough, with
the addition of alum, yielded loaves that were white, dry, crumbly, and unobjection-
able both as to taste and appearance.

       On the Presence of Copper in the Tissues of Plants and Animals.

           By W. Odling, M.B., F.C.S. ; and A. Duphe, Ph.D.

   The authors had made more than 100 examinations by a great variety of processes,
and had recognized the presence of copper in nearly every instance. In several
specimens of wheat-grain and animal tissue the copper had been estimated. From
100 grains of wheat-ash, the authors had obtained "023 grain, and from an entire
sheep's liver, '515 grain, of oxide of copper. The process used, was to precipitate
the copper eletrolytically on a platinum wire, to dissolve the deposit in nitric acid,
and to ignite the residue of the evaporated solution.

            Om a new Method offorming Ammonio- Iodides of Metals.

                    By the Rev. J. B. Reade, M.A., F.R.S.

    It is only within the last few years that the attention of chemists has been directed
to compounds of metals with iodine and ammonia. The 5th edition of Brando's
' Chemistry,' published in 1841, is silent on the subject. At the Oxford Meeting of
the British Association in 1847, Mr. Reade exhibited the ammonio-iodide and per-
iodide of gold, and he has since experimented with other metals.

   The common method of forming the ammonio-iodides, is by placing an iodide of the
metal in liquor ammonias, or in ammoniacal gas, with or without heat. The method
which Mr. Reade adopts, is to place the pure metal in direct contact with iodine when
dissolved in ammonia.

   Some caution is required in forming this solution, but with ordinary care to secure
a large excess of iodine, which dissolves teriodide of nitrogen if formed, the explosion
of this terrible compound may be avoided.

  --Solution of Iodine in Ammonia. Perhaps the best mode of dissolving iodine in am-

monia for the purpose in question, is to place about 50 or 60 grains of iodine in an
evaporating dish, hold it over the spirit-lamp for a few seconds till it is thoroughly warm
--56 REPORT 1857.

and the vapour arises, and tlien add a few drops of liquor ammonias, wliich will be im-
mediately charged with a large excess of iodine in solution. This may he poured into
a bottle, and more iodine and ammonia added until the requisite supply is obtained.

  --Ammo7no-iodide of Gold. Gold-leaf when placed in the iodine solution instantly

turns black (or purple if the solution be diluted), and immediately dissolves, like sugar
in water. If left to evaporate spontaneously in some quantity, we obtain black four-
sided prisms of the ammonio-periodidc, which readily dissolve in water; and if a very
weak solution be exposed for some months to the direct action of the sun's rays, a slight
precipitate appears, and a drop or two of the clear solution furnishes a most striking
microscopic object, both as to crystalline arrangement and richness of tint, when placed

in polarized light.

    The application of gentle heat to the ammonio-periodide expels iodine, and leaves

white crystals of the ammonio-iodide.

   The addition of ammonia to the ammonio-iodides is generally attended with inter-
esting results. In the present case, by adding ammonia to the periodide of gold we
obtain a crop of minute six-sided crystals tei-minated by hexahedral summits, and acted
on by polarized light.

    If a drop or two of the iodine solution be spread on a slip of glass, and two or three
square inches of gold-leaf be dissolved in it, a very slight application of heat will quicken
the crystallization and cause it to assume the arborescent form, or if the little forest
be not quite satisfactory, a second solution, by means of a drop of water and re-cry-
stallization, will give what is required. The slip of glass must now be held over the
spirit-lamp to drive off the iodine, at first slowly, and continued there till the evapo-
rable elements are gone and nothing remains but metallic arborescent gold as a charm-

ing microscopic object. It may be protected by Canada balsam, as in the example
exhibited. The ammonio-periodide of gold is a very valuable ingredient in the toning

bath for photographic pictures. Before adding it to the solution of hyposulphite of
soda, or using it as an independent bath, it should be dissolved in water and boiled in
a test tube, or an evaporating dish, to drive off any free iodine, and then the quantity

added to the bath depends upon the tint required for the picture, wliich may be brought
up to a deep purple.

   The solution of iodine in ammonia may also be successfully used in separating the

pure metal from gold ore obtained at "the diggings," where the per-centage of gold
is very small. In a commercial point of view this solution might be in some cases even
 more available than mercury, and the iodine could be easily collected and used for

 further experiments.

  --Ammonio-iodide of Silver. Gmelin says of the ammonio-iodide of silver, that

 " unfused iodide of silver absorbs with evolution of heat 3"6 per cent, of ammonia,
 and forms a white compound, which on exposure to the air gives off annnonia and

 turns yellow again."

    The phenomena are far more interesting when silver-leaf is added to the ammonia
 solution of iodine. The metallic silver is immediately dissolved, and when a few
 drops are placed on a slip of glass beautiful brushes of prismatic crystals shoot out in
 all directions, which may be mounted as a microscopic object in Canada balsam after
 the excess of iodine is spontaneously evaporated. Under polarized light the colours

 of the crystals are brilliant in the extreme.

   A few drops of rather strong ammonia added to these crystals of ammonio-iodide of

 silver on the stage of the microscope, produce a crop of hexagonal and triangular
 plates, which attain soon after their formation a variety of tints rivalling the reflexions
 from the facets of the diamond. The)' must of course be viewed as opake objects,
 but unfortunately they are not permanent and cannot be preserved in the cabinet.

--This is also the case with similar crystals of iron similarly formed.
    Ammonio-iodide of Mercury. The phenomena in forming this compound are varied
 and interesting. Mercury is added to the iodine solution, and after the application
 of heat and the addition of a little water, a few drops on a slip of glass give bundles
 of prismatic crystals similar to those of silver, and acted on with the same energy by
 polarized light. If ammonia be added to these crystals they are immediately covered
 with tufts of snowy whiteness, and by degrees these are converted into ruby-coloured
 hexagonal prisms which are permanent.

solutions of cobalt either by hydriodic acid or iodide of potassium, or by iodic acid
or iodate of potassa." The author fiuds, however, that cobalt yields to the action of
the amraonio-iodide solutions after some hours' digestion and a little heat and water.

As might be expected, it exhibits very strongly the sympathetic properties of the
chloride; for when placed on paper and gently heated, it becomes a brilliant green,
which of coiu'se vanishes as the paper cools.

   The prismatic crystals obtained by evaporation on a slip of glass and mounted in
balsam are decidedly acted on by polarized light ; but the chief value of this neve com-
pound will be found in its properties as a photographic agent.

   When used for the purpose of iodizing collodion, it certainly produces richness of

detail in those parts of the picture where iodide of potassium often fails, and it is also
exceedingly sensitive to the action of light when ordinary attempts would be fruitless.

--Photographic chemists may therefore profitably turn their attention to this compound.
   Ammonio-iodide of Titanuim. As titanium, which resists every direct method of

attack in the laboratorj', yields after a period of digestion in the iodine solution, it is

probable that other of the scarcer metals, which are with difficulty reduced by the
ordinary methods, might be exhibited in the form of ammonio-iodides, and thus throw
additional light on their respective equivalents.

   The crystals of ammonio-iodide of titanium which Mr. Reads obtained, were from
a pure specimen of the metal obtained by Mr. Waterhouse, of Halifax, from the slag

--of the neighbouring iron furnaces at Low Moor.
   Ammonio-iodide of Aluminium. In forming this compound, Mr. Reade used not
the pure metal, but alumina only, precipitated in the usual way. Afier allowing the
alumina to digest for some time in the iodine solution, the whole was boiled in a little
water, which dissolved the new compound, and upon evaporation and the proper mea-
sure of heat to volatilize the excess of iodine and ammonia, a white semi-metallic
substance remained, as in the case of silver. It is soluble in dilute hydrochloric acid,
and yields a blue precipitate on the addition of yellow prussiate of potash. Whether
any use can be made of this process towards obtaining the pure metal, is a problem
for practical men.

The author had succeeded in running down, with great facility, several ounces of

best cable bolt-iron into buttons of metal, which presented on fracture a beautiful
lamellar structure, and worked extremely well at a low heat ; but which, after having
been exposed to a welding heat, was altogether useless, from its property of cracking

On the Nutritive Properties of the Potato, lohen properly manipulated, as
         compared with Wheat, <Sfc. By Jasper W. Rogers, C.E.

The object of the writer was to introduce the use of the potato for the manufacture

of flour and meal analogous to flour and meal of wheat and oats, and thus to preserve
the potato in a state equally fit for the food of man. It vifas an error to imagine the
potato had not the same elements of nutrition as wheat and oafs. The nutritive pro-
perties of the potato, when deprived of its average quantum of water, which might

be stated at 75 per cent., were as follow:        84-077 per cent.

             Of starch

                 ,, gluten                        14-818  ,,
                 ,, oil                            1-104  ,,
Whilst the nutritive properties of wheat are
                                                  78199 per cent.
             Of starch

,, gluten                                         17-536  ,,

,, oil                                            4-255   ,,

Why then should the potato be used merely boiled or baked as a garden vegetable,

whilst by proper manipidation it might be converted into a material for producing

meal and flour nearly, if not fully, equal to wheat, and of a nature also, that resists

the usual action of climate and decay, as had been abundantly proved by its trans-

mission to the tropics, as well as by tests made by the writer imder the orders of

Governinent in producing several descriptions of food from potatoes at the South

Dublin Union ?

    But the proper manipulation of tlie potato was the more imperative and essential,
from the fact of the greatly increased quantity of food which it yields as compared

with wheat. An acre of laud planted with potatoes, will, when the watery portion

is extracted, produce, of dry matter or meal, similar in appearance to whcaten meal,
about 4076 lbs. ; whilst an acre of wheat will produce but about 105,5 lbs. Thus the
quantity of food from the potato, nearly analogous to food from wheat, is nearly four

times that from wheat.
   Samples of the several preparations of meal and flour of potato were exhibited

and the process of manufacture was stated to be so simple as to be within reach of
farmers and householders generally, by using the usual appliances of the dairy, &c.

On some of the Medicinal and Chemical Properties of Carbonized Peat Moss
                          By Jasper W. Rogers, C.E.

    Peat possesses in itself, and in the water combined with it, great anti-putrescent

powers. Human bodies have been frequently found in peat mosses in a state of pre-
servation scarcely inferior to that of an Egyptian mummy. The analyses of peat

moss discover substances not to be found in wood, amongst others "paraffine,"
closely analogous to spermaceti. The absorptive power of peat moss, properly car-

bonized, was found by mea.«!ure as follows :
                                  100 volumes of Ammoniacal gas.

                                    60 ,, ,, Sulphuretted hydrogen.
                                     40 ,, ,, Carbonic acid gas.
   The author states, that experiments as to the effects to be obtained by the action
of "carbonized peat," used medicinally, had been made by competent medical men,
and that in dyspepsia, and all diseases of the stomach and chest, the effect of carbo)>-

izcd peat moss, exhibited internally, had been found specially advantageous. He
proposes an explanation of this effect on the known anti-putrescent quality of peat,

and concludes that if it be true, it can scarcely be doubted that in " carbonized peat
is to be found a remedy for cholera. It is an anii-pulrescent and a ionic, combined
with an absorbent power, which has no known equal."

On a Process for the Determination of the Nitrates in Plants.
     By Professor W. K. Sullivan, Ph.D., M.R.I.A.

The author pointed out the great importance of finding a process for the purpose,

because in determining the amount of nitogen in plants by the usual processes, a part

of the nitrogen of the nitric acid is included in the result, and consequently the true

amount of assimilable azotic proximate principles cannot be deduced from ultimate

analysis, if nitrates be present. The chief feature of the process is the use of sulpho-

vinate of silver to precipitate the vegetable acids ; the silver salts of which are inso-

Heluble in absolute alcohol, while the nitrate of silver is soluble.  also pointed out a

method of separating lactic and acetic acids from one another when present.

On the Presence of several Acids of the Series C" H" O'' among the Products of

  the Distillation of Peat. By Professor W. K. Sullivan, Ph.D., M.R.I.A.

    Professor Snllivan stated, that he first observed the presence of butyric acid in the
acetic acid prepared from peat, about five or six years ago, but had not an opportunity
of examining the subject further until recently, when he became possessed of a large
quantity of raw products of peat, which he hoped gradually to investigate, The pro-
cess of separating the acids, and the results of the analyses of some of the compounds
of each, were described. The salt of baryta, which was obtained with butyric acid,
contained four equivalents of water, and therefore corresponded with one of Chancel's
salts. The tendency of butyrate of baryta to crystallize in the anhydrous form was
remarked, and the great difficulty of obtaining the hydrated salts, which accounts for
Lerch having always obtained that salt as an anhydrous compound. The formation
of a considerable amount of cyanide of ammonium, by the destructive distillatioB of

peat, was also established.

Remarks on the Solubility of Salts at high temperatures, and on the action of

  BySaline Solutions on Silicates under the influence of Heat and Pressure.
  Professor W. K. Sullivan, Ph.D., M.'RJ.A.

   The author observed, that crystallized gypsum heated with water in a sealed tube to
a temperature of 150° Cent, lost part of its water, and formed the hydrate 2(CaO SO'),

HO ; when heated for several hours at a temperature of 200° C. it was completely

dehydrated. Several of the zeolites, heated under similar circumstances, were also

dehydrated, but this required a much higher temperature, and a much longer expo-
sui'e to the heat than the dehydration of the gypsum. Some experiments upon the

solubility of salts at high temperatures were also mentioned, and a suggestion made

as to the probability that there exists for each salt a temperature of absolute insolu-

bility, unless it was a compound decomposable at a much lower degree. In connexion
with this subject, the author confirmed the interesting observation of M. Couste, of the
total insolubility of sulphate of lime at a temperature of about 150° C. The author

stated that he was still engaged with experiments upon this subject.

On the Composition of Norwegian Apatite. By Professor Voelcker, F.C.S.

   The author stated that all the specimens of apatite which he obtained from
Kragerbe in Norway, were perfectly free from fluorine and contained variable quan-

tities of chloride of calcium.

   In some specimens he found as little as 1*61 to 1'71 per cent, of chloride of cal-
cium, in others as much as 641 to 6'70.

   These specimens were obtained from the same block of crystalline apatite. The
following analyses express the composition of several specimens of this Norwegian

apatite :

    All the samples of apatite were perfectly free from carbonates. After uniting the
phosphoric acid with lime to tribasic phosphate, and with chlorine, there remains over
in each analysis an appreciable quantity of lime, which is neither united with carbonic
acid nor with fluorine. At any rate, the author's results show that the ordinary
formula for apatite cannot be applied to the apatite from Krageroe, which, as has been
stated, is distinguished by the entire absence of fluorine, and a very small proportion
of chlorine in some specimens.

                On the Methods of Analysing the Siqjerphosphates.
                        By Professor Voelcker, F.C.S.

    In this paper Dr. Voelcker reviewed the different methods of analysing superphos-
phate, and directed attention to the fact that the biphosphate of lime in commercial
superphosphates is decomposed when the latter are boiled out at once with water, in
consequence of which the amount of soluble phosphate is always obtained too low if

boiling water is em))loyed for extraction.

   He showed likewise that the amount of organic matter and ammoniacal salts in

superphosphate cannot be determined as usually done by burning, inasmuch as sul-
phuric acid is thereby driven out, and the per-centage of organic matter obtained too

high.

   Superphosphates often contain common salt in considerable quantities ; in deter-
mining the alkaline salts, the common salt is obtained as sulphate of soda, and has to
be stated in the results of chloride of sodium. He next pointed out the variable
composition of the precipitated phosphates, and recommended in accurate analyses
the method of Wbhler for determining the composition of the phosphates.

   Allusion having been made to the irrational manner of stating the results of analysis,
Dr. Voelcker described his own plan of analysing superphosphate, of which the fol-

lowing is a brief abstract.
    Water and nitrogen are determined as usual. 30 to 35 grains of superphosphate

are exhausted three or four times with two ounces of distilled water each time, and
then boiled out with sufficient water to obtain an excess of gypsum in solution. The
insoluble portion is collected in a weighed filter, dried, weighed, and then burned.
The ash is then dissolved in HCl, the solution precipitated with ammonia, and the
filtrate from insoluble phosphates with oxalate of ammonia. The portion dissolved
in water is concentrated with the addition of some HCl to prevent phosphates falling
down, the soluble phosphates are then thrown down with ammonia, the filtrate from
phosphates is precipitated with oxalate of ammonia, and the filtrate from lime evapo-
rated for alkaline salts. In accurate analysis the phosphates have to be analysed.

    On the Proportion of Organic Phosphorus in Legumine.
                By Professor Voelcker, F.C.S.

   The presence of phosphorus in legumine, contained in it in organic combination
and not in the form of phosphates, was shown by the author by deflagrating a mixture
of leo-umine with carbonate of soda and nitre, dissolving the white residue in dilute
hydrochloric acid, and precipitating the sulphiu-ic acid with BaCl, removing the ex-

cess of BnO by pure sulphuric acid, adding to filtrate from BnO, SO^ ammonia to

throw down any phosphates present, evaporating to small bulk, and precipitating finally
phosphoric acid with ammoniacal sulphate of magnesia.

   In this way the following results were obtained :

On the Preservation of Albuminized Collodion Plates.

           By W. Sykes Ward, F.C.S.

   Having made numerous experiments on tlie application of albuminized collodion
according to Taupenot's process, in comparison with collodion washed and covered

with gelatine, according to the process published by Dr. Hill Norris and others, the

author found the albuminized collodion process to give better results in all respects,

excepting that of deteriorating by keeping. He also found that plates prepared by

Taupenot's process were affected by the wood of the dark slide, especially in some
instances in which he employed unvarnished cedar wood.

    In the hope of combining the advantages of both processes, he poured on the plates
prepared in accordance with Taupenot's process, and whilst yet wet, various solutions
of gelatine and metagelatine, and found that these had the desired effect of enabling
him to keep the sensitized plates without deterioration at least four times as long as he
could, under similar circumstances, keep the plates not so protected.

   The additional coating of metagelatine also gives a clearness, brilliancy, and trans-
parency to the negative which is seldom obtained by the ordinary process. The coat-
ing of metagelatine is applied after the sensitized plate has been carefully washed, and
may be dried by heat, or in the ordinary manner.

The following is the formula preferred :

                   On the Processesfor the Detection of Fluorine.
             By Professor G. Wilson, M.D., F.R.S.E., F.C.S.

   The author made an oral communication on M. Nickles' recent observations on the
etching of glass as produced by the vapour of fuming sulphuric acid at a high tempe-
rature, and disputed the validity of Nickles' conclusion, that his results prove the in-
Heapplicability of glass to the detection of fluorine in the form of hydrofluoric acid.
also drew attention to the impossibility of detecting minute traces of this acid, if
quartz, as proposed by Nickles, was substituted for glass as the material to be etched,
and stated his intention of publishing at length his investigations on the relative suit-
ability of glass and quartz for the detection of fluorine.

            On the Time required by Compounds for Decomposition.

                               By Dr. T. Woods.

   The object of this paper was to prove that all compounds require a certain length

of time in which, under similar circumstances, they can be decomposed; that this
time is invariable in amount, definite and specific. It was first shown experimentally
that different compounds require different " times" in which to decompose. This was
done by making a galvanic pair, one end of which was zinc in sulphuric acid, the other

end, in a porous cell, platina in the compound to be decomposed. When the metals

are joined externally, a galvanometer being included in the circuit, the needle shows
the amount of electricity in circulation, and consequently the rapidity with which the
zinc is being dissolved, and therefore the " time " in which the decomposition of the
compound is going on.

   By successively using different compounds, the time for the decomposition of each
was seen, and for the same compound always to be the same under like circumstances.
It was also shown that the length of time each compound requires for decomposition
was proportional to the amount of heat absorbed by the decomposition ; the more

heat absorbed the longer it required to absorb it ; so that the interesting fact was
proved, that all compounds require the same length of time to absorb the same quan-
tity of heat in decomposing. It was shown that the galvanometer in this arrange-
ment acted the part of a thermometer of chemical action, as the needle varied exactly
with the amount of heat absorbed in a given time.

   The paper urged the importance of attention being paid to thermo-chemistry, and
claimed the precedence of all others on the subject it treated of, as the " time " of action

in chemical changes had not hefore been noticed. It concluded by expressing a doubt
if electricity and heat could be the same agent, or modification of it, as equivalents
of substances always produce, in combining, the same amount of electricity, but very
different amounts of heat.

Notice of the occurrence of a Boulder of Granite in the White Chalk of the

     South-east of England. By Robert Godwin- Austen, F.JR.S.

The author described first the threefold division of the cretaceous series of the
South-east of England ; the extent of the area occupied by each division, and the

--conditions of accumulation thus severally implied that, commencing from shallow

water, each shows more extended boundary lines, and increasing depth.
   1 . Littoral shingle of Lower greensand or Neocomian group at Farringdon ; deepest

deposits in Neocomian clays, with Bivalves in normal position, not exceeding ten

fathoms.
   2. Gault had its deep beds over South-east parts of England, its littoral ones in the

West, as in the Halden-sands.
   3. The area of the white chalk ranged as far North as the North of Ireland, and

from the coast of Scotland to the area of the Baltic, and thence occupied a broad
zone over North Germany. In Western Europe the conditions under which the white
chalk was accumulated were remarkably uniform ; for the whole of the Anglo-French

basin (Seine), 800 feet maybe taken as its average thickness, the whole a deep-water

accumulation.
   Rolled shingle and fragments of extraneous rocks have been found in the chalk,

and are to be seen in several collections ; they are all of crystalline, mostly granitic
rocks, and their size is not considerable yet in every case they are beyond the moving

                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

   Modes of transfer of marginal materials into great depths are,
   1. By floating sea-weeds. Illustrations of this are to be seen on most coasts, and
evidences of it may be detected in most of the older sedimentary deposits.

   Description of the Croydon Granite Boulder. Form, size, and weight such that it
could only have been moved by ice ; other materials associated with it, such as rounded
pebbles of other crystalline rocks and siliceous sand. Such an association of materials

sinking in one place, shows that they were held together in the act of sinking, as also

when they sank into the fine calcareous mud of the chalk sea- bed.
   The author abstained from entering upon a description of tlie rocks found associated

with the Croydon boulder, but stated that such an assemblage existed only in the

Scandinavian and other northern regions.

    The inferences to be derived from the foregoing considerations have a very inter-

esting bearing on the physical geography of the North European area, at the period of

the greatest expansion of the Cretaceous sea. There were regions of the globe then,

as  now,  where  coast-ice  was  periodically  formed,  was  broken  up  and  dispersed                                             these
                                                                                                                                 ;

regions lay to the north of the area of the white chalk of West Europe, and the white

chalk ocean extended continuously up to such latitudes.

    Why, if ice was the transporting agent, such materials are not more common, was

explained with reference to the present course taken by the icebergs and ice-floes of

the Atlantic.

    During the Drift period of the Pliocene division of geological history, the set of the

liberated ice was more eastward, and was dependent on considerations which are well

understood and can be made available for every geological period.

On Carboniferous Limestone Fossils from the Count?/ of Limerick, collected

 county of Limerick, which, from its containing several new forms, and the fine state
 of preservation of many of the specimens, presented points of structure and other pecu-
 liarities not before described. The fauna of the carboniferous limestone period,
 which is usually one of the richest in zoophytes, in this collection is represented only
 by a small proportion, principally belonging to the division Zoantharia tabulata of
 Prof. Milne-Edwards, amongst which are the genera Michelinea and Chcetites, with
 the characteristic and extensively distributed coral Amplexus coralloides. The Echino-
 dermata, which are most familiar to us in a fossil state, in this collection belong
 almost entirely to one division of crinoids, the Melocrinidae, consisting of numerous
 detached bodies, principally otPlatycrinns axiAActinocrinus, genera almost exclusively
 confined to this formation. Remains of animals of the class Bryozoa or Polyzoa, now
 included with the MoUusca, are well exhibited by various forms, principally belonging

 to the family Reteporidse, amongst which are fine specimens of the well-known form
 Fenestella membranacea of Prof. Phillips. Of the Brachiopoda, the family Terebra-

 tulidae are represented by but one species, the Terebratula hastata, of which there is
 a numerous and fine series. Of the Spiriferidje, there are several characteristic species,

 together with the Athyris Roissyi, a singular and rare form belonging to this family,

 in which the lines of growth are developed into expansions, giving it a fringed appear-

ance. Of the family Rhynchonellidse, are the common forms of Rhynchonella fuynus
and pleurodon. The Orthidae are represented by the well-known Orthis resupinata, and
the very rare species Orthis radialis, and other well-known forms. Also numerous
examples of several characteristic and some rare species of the family Productidse are
found, including Productus aculeaius; and a new species. Of the genus Chonetes there
Care several interesting and rare varieties, including C, variolata (D'Orb.) and papl-
lioiiacea. The Conchifera, or Lamellibranchiata, form a fine series, containing several
new forms, amongst them being several species of the genera Aviculopecten and

Pteronites (M'Coy), shells having an oblique axis like most of the so-called Pectens of
the coal-measures. Of the singular shell called Conocardium Hibernicum (Pleurorhyn-

chus of Prof. Phillips) several instructive specimens were collected, showing the ex-
panded keel and siphonal tube, which in some species is still more extended, being pro-
bably analogous (as suggested by Mr. S. P. Woodward in his 'Manualof the MoUusca')

to the soft, elongated siphons of a remarkable gi-oup of cockles inhabiting the inland

salt seas, Aral and Caspian, burrowing in mud ; also a second species, of which several

specimens were collected, some of them attaining a larger size than the C. Hibernicum,

being remarkably perfect, and having a long siphonal tube, which Prof. De Koninck
agreed with the author in considering an undescribed form. He proposed, therefore, to

dedicate this magnificent species to that distinguished palaeontologist under the name

of Conocardium Koninckii. There are several species of the genus Cardiomorpha, one
of which, C. Koninckii, is new to Britain, and another, a new species, of large dimen-

sions. The Gasteropoda, or univalve shells, are also numerously represented by many
genera and species, including a new species of Macrocheilus, and other undescribed
forms. Of the Nucleobranchiata, believed to be allied to the floating shells of the

present day, this collection contains several species of Belleropbon and Porcellia Puzo,
a discoidal form of great rarity. The highest order of MoUusca, and most important
geologically, are those of the Cephalopoda, which are here remarkable for size and
rarity of form, all belonging to the order Tetrabranchiata. The Nautilidse contained
many large and fine specimens, some of them being new species. Of the Orthocera-

tidae, specimens were collected of Orthoceras Muensterianum, fine examples of 0. dacty-
liophorum, and the peculiar formsof Gomphoceras {Poterioceras) fusiforme and Cyrto-

ceras Verneitilamim; also of the Goniatites, a division of the Ammonitidae, several
species, including G. crenistria and fasciculatus, alluded to as contained in this col-
lection, some of them showing external markings and others being new forms.

      On a New Fossil Fernfrom the Coal-Measures near Glin, County
                      Limerick. By W. H. Baily, F. G.S.

   The fossil plant alluded to by the author, and of which an enlarged representation
was given, was collected by Mr. G. Henry Kinahan, of the Geological Survey, from
the black shale above the coal townland of Ballygiltenan Lower, county of Limerick,
asBOCJated with ordinary coal plants. It appeared to be the central portion of a frond,

with about twenty alternating pinnules, which are apparently covered by thecsE, or
cases of the reproductive germs, presenting an appearance somewhat resembling rows
of small flowers. The unique character of this singular plant, possessing, as it does, a
form so totally unlike any recent or fossil plant, combined with the rare circumstance
 in fossil ferns of the carboniferous period, that of bearing organs of fructification, which

here appear to be so fully developed, renders it of great interest, and may possibly
constitute it a new generic form.

          On the Drift of West Galway and the Eastern parts of Mayo.

              By J. Birmingham, ofMillbrook, County Galway.

   The author sets out by alluding to the interest and importance of the Irish driftsi
general, which are well developed in the district to which his paper refers. They differ
from the drifts of many other countries by containing no fossiliferous evidence of their
comparative date : and, to account for the absence of shells or any traces of boring
molluscs in their materials, the author suggests that the remains of those great drifts,
which are now exposed, never formed the surface of the former sea-bottom, but were
probably situated at a depth to which no shell-fish ever reached. He divides the
drift of his district into three principal divisions; namely,

   1. The Clay Drift, from a point between the south-east and the west, forming cliffa
on the north, east, and south shores of Galway Bay.

   2. The Great Boulder Drift, from a point between the north and the west, over-

lying the former.

   3. The Escar Drift, forming the chains of gravel hills in the interior of the country,
from the south-west.

   The direction and sequence of those drifts are inferred from their mineralogical
characters and relative positions. The perfect round forms of the Escar Hills, and
the complete curves that their beds or layers generally exhibit in any stratified sec-
tion, not only prove their subsequency to the other drifts, but show that their emer-
gence from the waves, at which time they must have received their present contour,
did not take place during any glacial period ; for if icebergs had been moving about,
and grooving the rock bottom of the shallowing sea, the Plscars would scarcely have
escaped their action, which would be recognized in the tabulation of their summits,
or other significant appearances. The long ranges of those gravel hills may show the
resultants of currents that had been subdivided from the main stream, and met again
at large angles beyond the limits of opposhig hills.

   He refers to a fact which he considers worthy of note, from being at variance, as he
believes it to be, with recognized theory. He often observed that in the Escar drift,

the coarser gravel and boulders betray a tendency to arrange themselves in the upper
parts of the mass; and he has remarked the same phenomenon in the shoal beds
periodically formed by river floods.

   He maintains that it is to the power of moving water, and not either to land glaciers
or floating ice, that the great boulder drift of his district is also to be attributed. The

fact of large boulders being found on the sides and summits of hills, which they must
have ascended, sufiiciently refutes the land-ice hypothesis and the floating-ice theory

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

is rendered improbable by the appearance of a regular increase in number, as well as
in size and angularity, of the erratic blocks as they are followed towards their source.
Their decrease in number, according to their remoteness from their parent rocks,
might, indeed, be accounted for on glacial principles, but not so easily their decrease
in size ; for though the ice-raft may waste away by degrees, and its powers of buoy-
ancy become less, still this must be thought to affect the total quantity, rather than
the individual parts of the load that it bears. As its cliffs succumb in its progress

through the warm sea-waves, its burden may gradually be reduced; but there is no
reason why the largest masses should not be found among the mixed materials which

are still carried on its contracting area. If ice, therefore, were the transporting cause
of this drift, we should expect to see, scattered over the land, even a few large boulders
derived from distant localities ; but those are never found so situated ; they must be
looked for near their source. The clay drift is in some places stratified, and in others
amorphous ; and it presents no phenomena which, in the author's ophiion, oblige us
to have recourse to the agency of ice to account for its formation, while its southerly
                                                                                                        TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                        65

origin is directly opposed to such a hypothesis. Still the object of the author is not

to dispute the existence of a glacial period in his district, hut simply to state his

opinion that the conditions which the drifts exhibit must be ascribed to the eflect of
moving water, and not of ice.

   He alludes to Agassiz, as the first who applied the ice theory to the drift pheno-
mena of the British Islands, and remarks, that it may be with the geologist as with

the painter or the niusician, in whose works, though they speak the universal lan-

guage of genius, a national accent may still be noticed ; and the ice or water theories

may, to a great extent, owe their origin to the physical circumstances of the native

countries of their proposers. An inhabitant of Switzerland, who has been accustomed

to observe the vast powers of the glaciers grinding away the sides of mountains,

scooping out their bed in the granite rock, and carrying the fragments of fallen peaks

on the crests of their solid waves, must see that ice is indeed a great agent in geo-

logical phenomena                                                                                       and, on the other hand, to a native of our western isles, who has

the huge masses of their debris tossed about by the surge, the force of water will be

considered unsurpassed. One as correctly as the other might found a theory of

limited applicabilitj' on the great power he had been used to contemplate, but they

would be equally wrong in giving it too great a generalization                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            and the author hopes

lie thinks that the general contour of the country shows the existence of great

denuding action from the east at a period anterior to the drifts; and the rise of out-

cropping strata is generally towards the lowlands, proving them to be valleys of

denudation, where the upheaval and disturbance of the limestone beds rendered them

liable to be carried away. Looking south from Galway Bay, a grand illustration of
this phenomenon may be seen, where the inclined beach terraces of ancient seas

ascend the Burren Hills like stairs of giants; but the remark does not apply to the

mountains west of Loch Mask and Loch Corrib.

Ow certain Alterations of Level on the Sea Coast ofpart of the County of

The author described the elevation of an ancient sea-beach on the coast of the

County of Waterford, extending about two and a quarter miles, and reaching at one

part an elevation of 60 feet. The shells foutul in the upraised beach were exclusively

those  of Cardium edule                                                                                 the  elevation  is  believed  by the author to be of later date

the formation of trap-rock at Newton Head were noticed as bearing on this pheno-

igneous agency which raised the dyke.

         On the Geology of the Neighbourhood of Tralee.
               By F. J. Foot, Geological Survey.

   This paper is descriptive of a section north and south, from Bird Island on the
south shore of the mouth of the Shannon to the village of Castlemaine.

'J'he rocks seen in this section are given in a descending series, the uppermost

being the coal-measure shales, consisting of thick beds of black shale, more or less

fossiliferous, alternating with beds of olive-coloured grits, containing fragments of

plants.

The rocks under these are those of the carboniferous limestone, which may be

divided into three parts, upper, middle, and lower.

   The upper limestone in this district vai-ies from a light grey compact to a dark grev
crystalline limestone, abounding in fossils.

The middle portion is a thin bed, only a few feet thick, being a shaly impure lime-

stone, representing the calp.

   The lower member is chiefly a light gray hard compact rock, abounding in fossils.
   The thickness of the limestone is very difficult to ascertain, partly because the
limestone is often very thick-bedded, and partly that the great amount of drift in the

district prevents one getting a good section. The lines of stiatificntion arc also often
nu!ch tlfaccd by joints, cleavage, and weathering of tlic surface. Under tlio limestone
conies the carboniferous slate, consisting of black shale, brown grits, and some cal-
careous bands, full of fossils, the thickness being about 500 feet. Next comes the
yellow sandstone of Dr. Griffith, consisting of yellowish grit and ehales, varying from
i>00 to 1000 feet in thickness. The former is the thickness at the Slieve-Mhh
monntnins near Tralee ; the latter that near Bird Island. Here 1 discovered a thin
bed full of plants, all branching and some having a cellular structure ; there are some

leaves that look like those of Cyclopteris Hibernica.
    Below the yellow sandstone comes a considerable thickness of red sandstones and

slates, amounting at Slieve-mish to about 800 feet ; from this they pass downward into
a conglomerate. A remarkable point about this conglomerate is the manner in which
it varies both in thickr^ess and character. Its thickness where it is shown on the line
of section, is about 80 feet, and it consists of large and small rounded pebbles of
quartz, jasper, and hornstone, in a base of red sand ; while about one mile and a half
 further west (on the soiith side of the anticlinal of the Slieve-mish range, where the
beds are thrown down by a fault), it is more than 200 feet thick, and consists of large
angular fragments of gneiss, mica-schist, grey grit, trap ashes, &c., thinning out on
 the noi-thern slope to about 50 feet.

    This conglomerate is the lowest rock seen in this section, but it must not be con-
founded witli that which is now considered as the base of the carboniferous rocks in
this district, and which is several hundred feet below it, and lies unconformably on

the Silurians.

On the Relations of the Rocks at or below the base of the Carboniferous Scries
  of Ireland. By Sir Richard Griffith, Bart., LL.D., M.R.I.A., F.G.S.

   The author stated that he had found great difficidty, when preparing the several
editions of his Geological map of Ireland, in deciding on the class to which certain
rocks characterized by brown and reddish-brown grits and conglomerates ought to be

These      rocks  occur in  three  districts in  the  north                             viz.  one in  the  neighbourhood  of
                                                                                     ;

Pomerov and Omagh, in the counties of Fermanagh and Tyrone, one forming the

Curlew mountains in Sligo and Mayo, one forming the Croaghmoyle mountains and

neighbourhood in Mayo, and one extensive district in the south occupying large por-
tions of the counties of Cork and Kerry.

   The author then referred to his paper read at the Cork meeting of the British
Association for the Advancement of Science, from which it appeared that he was then
inclined to connect the conformable brownish-red sandstones and conglomerates with

the Silurian system.

   The author next referred to his paper read to the Belfast meeting of the Asso-j
elation on the yellow sandstone of the north shore of Mayo, and to the advice tendered^
to him by Sir H. De la Beche and Mr. Jukes, with reference to the omission on hid
map of the so-called Old lied Sandstone district, as the red rocks appeared to them ta
be all carboniferous, an opinion confirmed by the subsequent discovery of SiyUluri^
and Siigmaria Jicoides within the area, as also in similar rocks at MacSwyne's Bay ii

Donegal, a very large specimen from which locality is preserved in the court-yard (

the Royal Dublin Society.
   It appears therefore that these supposed Old Red Sandstone rocks of the North ard

undoubtedly carboniferous ; but it is yet doubtful to what series the red rocks belo«
lying unconformably to them may belong.

   The author then mentioned the limits of the true Old Red Sandstone of the Sonthj

from the east to the west side of the island, reposing on other red and purple rocka

which in the Dingle district become distinctly unconformable to them, while the red

and purple rocks themselves repose conformably on fossiliferous Silurian rocks.

   He then described the grounds on which he based his division of yellow sandstonel

principally from the occurrence of plants subsequently found by Professor Haughtoni
Mr. Jukes and others, to extend still lower down into the red rocks; and stated, that as

he considered the plants to be the proof of the yellow sandstone being of carboniferous
age, he was not prepared to deny the inference that the whole of the fish-beds of
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  67

 Scotland, and tlie similar rocks of Glamorgansliirc and Soulh Wales, might belong lo
 the carboniferous system.

   He estimated the mean thickness of the true Old Red Sandstone of tlie South of Ire-

land at about .'3000 feet, including 800 feet of yellow sandstone.
    The author then described an east and west section across Ireland from BInckstairs

mountain in the county of Wexford to the extremity of the Dingle promontory in tlie
county of Kerry, and afterwards entered into some details as to the structure of the

Dingle district and that round Killarney and Glengariff. He referred more parti-

cularly to the great difficulty which arose from the fact that the red and green rocks (for
which INIr. Jukes had proposed the term 'GlengarifFgrits,' a term which had his entire
concurrence) were conformable to the Silurian rocks of the Dingle district, while the
Old Red Sandstone reposed unconformably on both ; on the other hand, in the coun-
try south of Dingle Bay, it should be mentioned these same Glengariff grits passed
insensibly up into the Old Red Sandstone; and no want of conformity could be foxuid
in any part of the series, from the Glengariff grits as far up as the coal-measures;
and the author exhibited a north and south section through the Dingle jiromontory to

the valley of Kenmare, illustrative of his views. He then pointed out the analogy

between the Glengariff grits and the broivnish-red grits of the three districts in the
north of Ireland already alluded to, referring to numerous sections which he had for-
merly prepared.

   'J'he author thought, on the whole, from the occurrence of similar felstones and
ashes in the Silurian rocks and the Glengariff grits, and the f.icts stated above, that
there was a double probability in favoiu- of those rocks being of Silurian rather than of
Devonian age, or at all events that he was justified in the classification which he had
made on his map, and in distinguishing these rocks by separate letters and colours.

                      Notes from the Barhary Coast, with Fossils.

       By G. F. Habershon. (^Communicated by Dr. Gladstone.)

    In this communication there were described the promontory of sandstone stretching
into the Atlantic, on which the town of Mogador is built; two islands, likewise of
sandstone, one of which contains a remarkable central depression ; the sand-hills, and
the barren sandy plain, which extends some 20 miles by 5 or 6 inland; and the Iheb-
el-Hadeed, or " Mountains of the Iron," a day's journey to the north of Mogador.
There is a universal tradition that the plain was once luxuriant with vegetation, but
had been gradually covered with sand. This could not have been blown from any
desert, as the plain is surrounded on all sides by fertile regions, except that open to
the sea. That the land is sinking, is rendered probable by the very low position of
the town of Mogador, of a palace built long since by one of the emperors of Morocco,
and of a circular fort erected by the Portuguese on the shore and now in ruins, and
especially by the fact that it was the custom of the Moors in former times to drive
their cattle to feed on the larger island, by a path which is now covered at low tide
by about 10 feet of water.

   About half a mile from the northern gate of Mogador is a sand-hill, in which Mr.
Habershon had seen what appeared the stems, branches, and twigs of many trees,
but all converted into sand and hollow. Dr. Gladstone, who had suggested the pro-
priety of bringing over some of these fossils, described the specimens accompanying
the paper as branching irregular tubes of carbonate of lime, on the outside of which
sea-sand of a very heterogeneous character was cemented by crystals of the carbonate.
These specimens varied from half an inch to five inches in diameter; and though he
had formed several theories as to their origin and nature, not one of these seemed to
meet every point of the case. The communication was further illustrated by speci-
mens of sandstone from Mogador and the islands, minerals from the province of
Soos, and ironstone and chert from the Iheb-el Hadeed.

   On the Geology of Caldbeck Fells, and the Lower Sedimentary Rocks of

               Cumberland. By Professor Harkness, F.R.S.

   The district alluded to in this communication forms the northern portion of the
mountainous area of the lake district of Cumberland. Caldbeck Fells, including their

eastern extremity Carrick Fell, consist of masses of plutonic and igneous rocks. On

the southern slopes of tiicsc hills there is seen Skiddaw slate, which generally has a
south dip and this Skiddaw slate, as it approximates the granite of Skiddaw Forest,

                                                     ;

passes into chiastolitc slate, chiastolite rock, and a pseudo-gneiss. On the south side
of the granite area the same phenomena occur, hut on this side hornblende rock and

actinolite rock also appear. In the metamorj)hic rocks, and likewise in the ordinary
Skiddaw slates which succeed them in position, the strike of the strata is nearly
east and west, and the general arrangement of the strata seems to indicate that the
plutonic and igneous masses of C'aldbeck Fells form the axis of the group rather than
the granite of Skiddaw Forest. With respect to the uiuiltered rocks of tlie Skiddaw
district, these have been referred by Prof Sedgwick to three groups, black Skiddaw
slate, grits seen in the masses of Grassmoor, and grey Skiddaw slate containing fossils
described in the Palceozoic fossils of the Woodwavdian Museum. The upper grey
slates are the deposits which have hitherto afforded organic I'emains. Last year the
author obtained traces of worms from the black Skiddaw slate, the lowest member of
the unaltered series, at Threlkeld, and, from a communication which the author had
recently from Prof. Sedgwick, it would appear that in these low strata graptolitcs
have been lately obtained by Mr. J. Ruthven. With regard to the lithological nature
of these Skiddaw rocks, it would seem that there is a considerable change according
to locality. Westward grey slates, with intercalated grits, obtain on the line of the
strike of the black Skiddaw slates, leading to the inference that coarser beds supply
the place of the finer black slates on the eastern margin of the area.

  On the Jointing and Dolomitizatioii of the Lower Carboniferous Limestone

     in the Neighbourhood of Cork. By Professor Harkness, FM.S,

   The district round Cork consists of a series of hills and valleys, the former com-
posed of Devonian, and the latter of limestone belonging to the lower portion of the
caiboniferous series. In the latter are joints having three directions : one, the pre-
vailing direction being north and south and of the other two, one is almost horizontal

                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and the other oblique. These joints occur in great profusion in most of the limestone
localities ; but in certain spots where the limestone is siliceous and bedded, the joint-

ings are imperfect and the stratification distinct. Among these limestones there are

seen in the neighbourhood of Cork dykes of dolomite, and these dykes in jointed lime-
stone conform to the main perpendicular joints. In the limestone, where the strati-
fication is distinct, we often find also dolomites ; and these agree with the planes of
stratification. The production of these dolomites appears to be subsequent to the
deposition of the strata in which they occur. From the observations of Regnault it
would seem that sea-water (containing sulphate of magnesia) is capable of exerting
considerable influence on limestone, giving rise to carbonate of magnesia and sulphate
of lime; and the phenomena exhibited by the district around Cork would lead to the
inference that sea-watei-, finding access into rocks by joints, and in some instances
along the planes of stratification, so produced the dolomitic masses.

  On the Records of a Triassic Shore. By Professor Harkness, F.R.S.

   The area occupied by the trias strata referred to occurs in the north-west of England
and the south of Scotland, The deposits which form this series consist of argillaceous
strata and sandstones, and these beds have their surfaces marked by ripples, which
have resulted from the action of the wind on shallow water. Ripples of another
character also occur, and these have been produced by the influence of small rills
traversing a muddy shore. Tracks which have originated from the wanderings of
crustaceans likewise make their appearance on the surface of the sandstones, and with
these are found associated the sinuous tracks of annelids, as well as the pitted hollows
which form the entrances into the burrows of these animals. Pseudomorphic crystals
of salt are also exhibited in the state of small pyramidal elevations on the under sides
of the sandstones, affording evidence of natural salt-pans on this Triassic shore. Small
pittings mark, in many instances, the faces of the sandstones, and the surfaces repo-
sing upon these pitted faces manifest little dome-like elevations. These have arisen
from the eflTect of rain-drops, in most instances of a small size, resulting from fine

                        ;

they are the results of heavy drifting rain. All the physical conditions on these

ancient shores are such as we find under favourable circumstances on the Scindy and

muddy coast of our present seas.

                                     On a Model illustrative of Slaty Cleavage.
                               By the Rev. Professor Haughton, M.A., M.R.I.A.

This model was intended to illustrate Mr. Haughton's views respecting the distor-

tion of fossils by cleavage. It was made of zinc, and represented one-eighth part of

Athe ellipsoid of compression.                   moveable zinc quadrant might be placed in diiFerent

positions in the model, and thus show the manner in which the line of greatest elonga-

tion of the fossils shifted with the intersection of cleavage and bedding.

Ml-. Haughton stated that in all the rocks he had hitherto examined, the ellipsoid

of compression was very nearly oblate, with its short axis perpendicular to the planes

of cleavage.

On Fossil Stems allied to Stigmaria, recently obtained from the Upper Beds
  of the Old Bed Sandstone of Hook Point. Co. Wexford. By the Rev.
  Professor Haughton, M.A., M.R.I.A.

   It is well known to geologists that many plants of the genera Stigmaria, Lepido-

dendron, Knorria, Sigillaria, &c., have recently been found on this geological horizon
in Donegal, Mayo, Kilkenny, Cork, and Wexford.

   The specimens found at Hook Point are generally in very bad preservation. Those
exhibited by Professor Haughton showed the structure of the stem well-preserved.
There must have been a central bundle of vascular tissue, more or less woody ; a
hollow stem, and a thick bark ; the latter being connected with the central vascular
column by oblique spinous bundles analogous to the medullary rays of Calamites.

    In the specimens exhibited by Prof. Haughton, the central vascular column was
represented by a hollow tube filled with coaly matter and surrounded by the sandstone
cast of the hollow stem, outside of which again appeared the carbonaceous remains

of the bark of the stem, with the spinous processes on its inner surface. On the

whole he considered these obscure remains of the earliest vegetation of Ireland to be
allied to Stigmaria more closely than to any other fossil genus, and he believed that
there were some peculiarities in these plants which would amply repay a careful study.

   Accompanying the plant beds at Hook, was a thin bed of anthracitic coal, about
2 inches thick, the stems being found in the soft sandstone beds both above and below
the coal seam. The stems were sometimes 2 feet long, and always terminated

abruptly in the rock.

   In conclusion. Prof. Haughton stated that geologists present at the Meeting would
be able to form an excellent idea of the yellow sandstone flora by visiting the Museum
of the Geological Survey, Royal Dublin Society, and Trinity College, all of which
contained fine specimens of these plant remains.

On the Existence of Forces capable of changing the Sea-level during different
          Geological Epochs. By Professor Hennessy, M.R.I.A.

If, in assuming its present state from an anterior condition of entire fiuidit}', the

matter composing the crust of the earth underwent no change of volume, the direction

of gi'avity at the earth's surface would remain imaltered, and consequently the general

figure of the liquid coating of our planet. If, on the contrary, as we have reason to

believe, a diminution of volume should accompany the change of state of the mate-

i-ials of the earth from fluidity to solidity, the mean depth of the ocean would undergo

gradual, though small alterations, over its entire extent at successive geological epochs.

This result is easily deduced from the general views contained in other writings of the

author, whence it appears, that if the surface stratum of the internal fluid nucleus of

the earth should contract when passing to the solid state, a tendency would exist to

Aincrease the ellipticity of the liquid covering of the outer surface of the crust.

very small change of ellipticity woidd suffice to lay bare or submerge extensive tracts

^^of the globe. If, for example, the mean ellipticity of the ocean increased from            to

5^^, the level of the sea would be raised at the equator by about 2:?8 feet, while under
--70 REPORT 1857.

the parallel of 52* if. would be depressed by 196 feet. Sliallow seas and banks in the
latitudes of the British Isles, and between them and the pole, would thus be converted
into dry land, while low-lying plains and islands near the equator would be submerged.
If similar phenomena occurred during early periods of geological history, they would
manifestly influence the distribution of land and water during these periods ; and with
such a direction of the forces as that referred to, they would tend to increase the pro-
portion of land in the polar and temperate regions of the earth, as compared with the
equatorial regions during successive geological epochs. Such maps as those published
by Sir Charles Lyell on the distribution of land and water in Europe during the ter-

tiary period, and those of M. Elie de Beaumont, contained in Beudant's ' Geology,'

would, if sufficiently extended, assist in verifying or disproving these views.

                   071 the Conductivity of various Substances for Heat.

                By William Hopkins, M.A., LL.D., F.R.S.

   The author gave an accomit of the results of numerous experiments which he
had recently made on the conductive powers of various substances for heat. To
explain the object of these experiments, he stated that if a globe of very large dimen-
sions, like the earth, were heated in any manner and in any degree, and then left to
cool by the radiation of heat from the surface, the temperature of the mass at points

--not too remote from its surface, and after a great lapse of time, would follow a very

simple law, the increase of temperature in descending below the surface would bo

--proportional to the increase of depth supposing the conductive power of the mass

to be the same throughout. But if a stratum of another substance (as sedimentary
matter for instance in the case of the earth) should be superimposed on the sphere,
its horizontal extent being large in proportion to its thickness, the rate of increase of
temperature in descending within this stratum, would be greater or less than in the
other parts of the sphere, according as tlie conductive power should be less or greater.
It would be very approximately in the inverse proportion of the conductive power.
The principal object of these experiments was to ascertain whether such be the case

or not.

    The conductive powers of lime, clay, and sand, in the state of dry powder, are in
the order in which they are now mentioned. Calcareous rocks from dry chalk to hard
mountain limestone vary in their conductive powers (on the numerical scale adopted)
from 1'7 to 5*5; dry sandstone rocks from 2"5 to 7"o granite and very hard com-

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

pact felspathic rocks from 5 to 10.
    Hence it follows, that if the temperature observed at present in mines, Artesian wells,

&c. be entirely due to heat transmitted from a central nucleus, the rate at which the
temperature increases in descending below the surface of the earth, -ought to be very
different in different formations. It appears, however, that this rate in those mining
shafts and Artesian wells which have penetrated to the greatest depths, and in which
the observations are most trustworthy, in different parts of Western Europe, is nearly
the same in different formations. The author compared the two cases of the Puis de

Crenelle at Paris, and a vertical coal siiaft at Duckenfield nearManchester. He esti-

mated the conductive power in the former ca.se at one-half of that in the latter, while
it was found by observation that there was an increase of 1° F. for every CO feet of
depth in the former, and for about 64 feet in the latter instance ; whereas these depths,
instead of being in the ratio of 00 : 64, ought, according to the theory, to be in the
ratio of 60 : 120, This proves that the temperatures observed in these cases cannot
be due merely to heat transmitted from the interior of the earth by ordinary conduc-

tion.

    The author stated also that he had investigated the influence of induration, pres-
sure, moisture, and discontinuity, on the conductive powers of various substances,
referring for details to a paper lately read before the Royal Society.

 poi'tant bearing which it had on the general cLissification of the rocks between the top

 of the Silurian and the bottom of the carboniferous formations, usually classed as one
 thing under the terms of Old Red Sandstone, or Devonian Rocks.

    Along the extreme western coast, between Sibyl Head and Slea Head, a distance
of six miles, a nearly continuous section may be seen, consisting chiefly of red and
 greenish slates, sandstones and conglomerates, all dipping to the south at an angle of
about 60°, except the red sandstones and conglomerates of Sibyl Head, which dip to

the north, and repose unconformably on other red sandstones and conglomerates, the
age of which is doubtful.

    Between Ferriter's Castle and Doonquin the rocks are full of Upper Silurian fossils,
and contain interstratified beds of contemporaneous traps and ashes, principally feld-
spathic. By means of these peculiar beds, an inverted S-like contortion or anticlinal
and synclinal curve may be traced about Clogher Head; and if we take a certain band
of red sandstone and fine conglomerate interstratified with thin ash- beds as a boun-
dary, the fossils found below are more peculiarly Wenlock species, while those above
are Ludlow, including in some places an abundance oi Pe7itamerus Knightii.

   The following fossils, as determined by Mr. Salter, occur in the lower or Wenlock

group :--

--Zuoplnjta. Favosites polymorpha, alveolaris; Leperditia balthica; Halysites catenu-
 --latUK; Alveolites De la Bechei ; Syringopora ramulosa; Omphyma turbinatum.

In the Upper or Ludlow group, the following species occur according to the same

    This Upper or Ludlow band strikes from Dooncpiin into the interior, forming the
hill of Croaghniarin, and the adjacent ground. Over it may be seen a set of red
sliaU's and sandstones 800 or 1000 feet thick, which may be considered as passage
beds from the Ludlow into the overlying rocks, and thus representing the Tilestoncs
of South Wales. These pass gradually upwards into a great mass of pale green and
dull purple grits and slates, which, in conjunction with Mr. Griffith, the authors call
ihc (JlengarifF grits. These beds are about 6000 feet thick ; they contain no fossils,
but I'.ave occasional calcareous bands like the Cornstones of South W'ales and Here-
ford, and are believed to be contemporaneous with the Cornstone group of the Old
Red Sandstone of that district.

   Above the Glengarift' grits come a nearly equally thick series of bright red slates

and sandstones, with thick beds of coarse conglomerate, containing pebbles of calca-
reous grit which have fossils belonging to the Llandovery sandstone, such as Penta-
merrnt ohlongus, Pelraia Inna, Ci/clolites lunlicularis, Strophomena depressa, Eiicri-

nurus punclatus, SfC.

   In addition to those are many nearly angular fragments of felspathic traps and
ashes, and pieces of Silurian grits and slates. 'J'hese beds, which are excellently shown
along the shores of Dingle Harbour and the neighbourhood, are now called the Dingle

beds. So far the continuous succession of conforjnablc deposits is apparently unbroken,

--There are now two anomalous localities to be noticed : 1st. East of Dingle Har-

bour, at Coosathurig, near Bull Head, some rocks consisting of red and green grits
and slates, often calcareous, make their appearance, containing many common Wen-

lock fossils, such as Hulysitcs calenulatux, Atnjpa rctlcidaris, &c.* Over these

is a good thickness of black slates, in which nothing but fragments of encrinite

stems have been found. These two sets of beds strike directly E.N.E. from Bull

Head and Minard towards Cahirconree, and have on their northern side an equally

straight parallel band of " Dingle beds" dipping towards them, and as seen at two

localities abutting against them, either brought against them by a fault, or by some

curious and distorted unconformability. The second anomalous locality is north of Fer-

riter's Cove, between Ferriter's Castle and Sibyl Head, where thick masses of pale

salmon-coloured sandstone with some conglomerate appear to dip under the Wenlock

rocks, and would therefore occupy the place of the Llandovery sandstone, to which at

first they were assigned. This assumption, however, involves the supposition of such

enormous faults in other parts of the di?trict, that it has been thought better to sup-

pose them to be a slightly modified form of the group lying over the Ludlow rocks

(that which represents the Tilestones), and brought down against the lower part of
the Wenlock by a fault running through Smerwick Harbour about E.N.E. and W.S.W.

   Many faults are proved to e.xist in the district S. of Ferriter's Cove, and one or two

of great magnitude running E.N.E., or nearly so from that neighhom-hood, across

the Mount Brandon range parallel to the axes of the anticlinal and synclical curves

mentioned before. Over the whole of these highly inclined and dislocated rocks

sweeps another great mass of red sandstone and conglomerate, attaining in some

places a thickness of more than 3000 feet, resting quite unconforniably on everything

below, but dipping quite conformably under the lower beds of the carboniferous lime-

stone, wherever that formation is to be seen, namely, on the north about Castlegregory,

on the north-east and east about Tralee, and on the south-east about Castlemain.

Rising from underneath the lowland of tlie neighbourhood of Tralee and Castle Island,

this undoubted Old Red Sandstone gradually swells up into a broad anticlinal ridge,

the summit of which attains an elevation of 2700 feet in Baurtregaum and Cahirconree.

Between those two eminences a deep glen has been eroded in it, known asDerrymore

Glen, at the bottom of which grey slates and sandstones are formed, containing Upper

.Silurian fossils ; and to the west of Cahirconree a broad longitudinal valley, which may
be called that of Anascaul, has been eroded along the anticlinal axis of the Old Red

Sandstone, in which valley can be seen the rocks previously mentioned as striking from

Cahirconree to the coast at Minard. On the south side of this valley the Old Red

Sandstone proper, resting unconformably on the lower rocks, contains a curious local

conglomerate full of angular and rounded blocks of mica-schist, a rock not known in

situ anywhere in the neighbourhood. It is 200 feet thick in Derrymore Glen, but

thins out to six feet near Minard Head. This mica-schist conglomerate is not seen

in the Old Red north of the Anascaul valley, where that rock forms a bold and strong

unconformable capping to many of the hills, and has several outlying patches forming

the summits of peaks. One of these outlying patches also occurs on the south side,

resting on Bull Head, within four miles of Dingle Harbour, being its furthest west

extension on the south side of the promontorj', while on the north side the Old Red

Sandstone forms the capping of the ridge over Lough Anascaul, sweeps round Brandon

Ba}-, forms Brandon Head, and runs off thence in a direct straight line for eighteen

miles, dipping N.N.W. at Go°, and forming all the headlands that come within its

beundary from Brandon Head to the northern Blasket Island.

In the map of the promontory of Dingle, it may bo likened to the broken crust of

a pasty, through the fractures and holes of which the lower rocks become visible. It

   * Mr. Salter, from some fossils collected here, believes these beds to be lower than any seen
at Ferriter's Cove.

appears, then, from this description, that above the Upper Sihirian rocks, containing
true Ludlow fossils, and liaving a thickness of 3000 or 4000 feet, red rocks set in quite
conformable to, and graduating into these upper Silurian rocks, and tliatthese red rocks
have a total thickness of 10,000 or 12,000 feet. So far the facts are in exact accordance
with those of the typical Silurian district of South Wales, &c., and the Glengariff grits
and Dingle beds maybe placed on a parallel with the Cornstone group of Siluria and
the Cephalaspis beds of Scotland. Unfortunately this identification has not been con-
finned by the discovery of any fragments of Cephalaspis or other fish remains in the
Dingle district, but it is one that few persons, perhaps, will be inclined to dissent from.

    Unlike Silmia, however, instead of being covered in apparent sonformity by red
sandstone and conglomerates forming part of an apparently continuous series, the
Glengariff grits and Dingle beds are totally separated in the Dingle promontory from
these overlying sandstones and conglomerates by as complete a discordance of position

as can anywhere be seen, even between the Trias or New Red Sandstone, forming the

base of the Secondary, and the Carboniferous, Silurian, or other Palaeozoic rocks. It
certainly seems to the authors impossible to group these two entirely separated and
discordant things imder one name like that of Old Red Sandstone, and advisable to give
them two separate names.

    If the upper red sandstones and conglomerates which pass conformably upwards
into the base of the true carboniferous rocks should retain the name of the Old Red
Sandstone, some othex designation should be given to the Glengariff grits and Dingle
beds. If we call them Devonian, it follows that the terms " Old Red Sandstone" and
"Devonian" can no longer be considered synonymous; if, on the other hand, we
keep those names as synonymous, then some other term must be introduced to desig-
nate the Glengariff grits and Dingle beds of Ireland, and the Cornstone group of
Siluria and Cephalaspsis beds of Scotland. The Old Red Sandstone, which passes con-
formably up into the carboniferous rocks, may tiien be considered as the true base of
that system, and with it may be classed the red sandstones and conglomerates having
over them yellow sandstones often containing plants, which underlie the carboniferous
slates and lower limestone shales of South Ireland, South Wales, and South England,
the scraps of old red sandstones found here and there under the carboniferous lime-
stone of North Wales and North England, and also the Upper Old Red or Yellow sand-

stone of Scotland, containing Holopitjchius nohiUssimus, Cyclopteris {Sphenopteris)

Hibernica, &c.

    The Middle Old Red of Scotland, or Cephalaspis beds of Miller, and also the Lower
Old Red or Pterichthys beds of the same author, can, if the author's views be correct,
no longer be considered as Old Red Sandstone at all. What position the (rue Devonian
rocks of Devonshire and the Eifel beds of the Rhine will occupy with respect to the
two groups of red sandstone and conglomerate (the one capping the Silurian, and the
other forming the base of the carboniferous), is still uncertain. They may be either
wholly or in part the contemporaries of the one or the other, or they may be inter-
 mediate between the two, deposited perh.aps in the long interval which in the Dingle
 district was occupied by the elevation and contortion and great denudation of the
 lower group, and the exposure of the Silurian rocks on which they rested.

                 Notes on the Old Red Sandstone of South Wales.

                By J. Beete Jukes, M.A., F.R.S., M.R.I.A.

   After examining the work of the Geological Survey of the Dingle district, and seeing
that the rocks, which by most geologists would be considered to be Old Red Sandstone,
were there apparently conformable at their base to the top of the Upper Silurian rocks
containing Ludlow fossils, and conformable at their top to the base of the carbonife-
rous rocks, while they were themselves separated into two groups by an utter discord-
ance and wide unconformity in their centre, the author took a very hasty run on
leave of absence into South Wales, for the purpose of seeing whether anything similar
could be discovered there, if the country v;ere to be re-examined with that express
object. The short time at his disposal compelled him to confine his observations to

--three districts: 1st, the country about Llandeilofawr, and thence to Llandovery;

2ndly, the Beacons of Brecon ; Srdly, the valley of the Usk, south of Abergavenny and

east of Pontypool.
            ----

--74 REPORT 1857.

He exhibited a sketch section through each of these localities, which gave as a

result the following facts:

   1st. Near Llandeilo the Upper Silurian beds are capped by a narrow band of very
micaceous yellowish flags and grifs, occasionally conglomeritic, and frequently fossili-
ferous. Below these are dull red and purple beds, alternating with grey slates and

grits near Llangadddck, of which the following section is given by Sir H.De laBechc

(Memoirs of Geological Survey, vol. i. p. 23) :

                                                   Feet.

Line of red conglomerate

                                                   1075

Below are about 2000 feet of Upper Silurian rocks of the ordinary blue and grey

colours.

   Above this band of micaceous flags, here and elsewhere, for a distance of many

miles, blood-red marls and shales set in, alternating with red sandstones, and fre-

quently containing beds of the red or greenish or mottled calcareous sandstones,

or concretionary limestones known as Comstones. These beds are frequently and

excellently shown over a band of country a mile wide and twelve miles long, from

Middleton Hall to the Sawdde, near Llangaddock, and always vertical, or nearly so.

Between them and the escarpment of the carboniferous limestone, to the south is a

narrow richly-wooded valley in which little or nothing could be seen, except near

CwmCastell  Cennen, where a mass of carboniferous limestone is brought down by

a fault close against some of these vertical beds dipping at them at 20°, the Old Red

Sandstone between this detached lump and the escai-pment of carboniferous limestone

being gently arched and contorted, and then dipping conformably under the carboni-

ferous rocks, which it was seen to do everywhere in the neighbourhood.

Six miles east of Llangaddock, in the glen of Llechclawdd, these same rocks with

strong cornstone bands dip S.E. at 70°; but on proceeding into the red district, the

angle soon flattens to 45° and 20°, but without any appearance of want of conformity,
while further on, five miles east by south of Llandovery, Silurian rocks and Old Red

Sandstone alike lower their angles of dip to 30° or 40°; and as we jiroceed towards

Brecknock, the Old Red Sandstone beds containing the Comstones undulate in various

directions, at angles never exceeding 5° or 10°.

What may be the exact nature of the overlap towards the west of the red rocks

over the Upper Silurian, and of the upper part of the red rocks over the lower part of
the same, and finally of the carboniferous rocks over the Old Red till the coal-measures

rest directly on the Lower Silurian, he had no time to inquire.

  2ndly. A walk across the Beacons of Brecon showed that from the Comstones deep

down in the Old Red Sandstone to the base of the carboniferous limestone, theie wiis
no apparent break. Red marls occiu'rcd throughout, containing brown and grey
flagstones and sandstones with no conglomerate worthy of the name, all dijjping

south at about 5°.

   3rdly. On examining the narrow valley of the Usk, hov/ever, near Pontyponl, the

Upper Silurian rocks were found to differ greatly from those near Llandeilo and Llan-

dovery. There were no red beds in them, no appearance of any graduation between
them and the Old Red Sandstone, and finally they either plunged at high angles with

some contortion and obliquity tov. ards the valley of Old Red, or as at one place dipped
directly from it at 25° close to the boundary, while the Old Red Sandstone inclined
towards the carboniferous escarpment, at angles varying from 10° to 30°. Here then

there appeared to be a possibility, at all events, of an unconformity between the Old

RedSandstone and the UpperSilurian, and a possible concealment therefore of the lower
beds of the Old Red Sandstone, which have a conformable junction with the uppermost
beds of the Ludlow rocks, beneath the imconformablo beds of the Upper Old Red.

This conclusion, though based on very slender evidence, is strengthened by the fact

of the 8(;ction here giving, with all allowances, a thickness of only 2500 feet for tbo

Old Red of this locality, while the section through the Beacons of Brecon shows 3000
feet for the beds above the Cornstones, and those near Llandeilo at least 5000 feet for
the vertical beds of the Cornstone group, without reckoning the upper gently inclined
beds near the escarpment of the carboniferous limestone. The tortuous boundary of
the Upper Silurian and Old Red in the valley east of Pontypool forbids the supposition

of its being a fault.

   As a general result, the author stated his belief that it was possible the Old Red
Sandstone (so called) of Soutli Wales might be really two things, just as the New Rod
S;indstone of former days is now believed to be two things, although it is probable that
from their similarity of character their separation maybe more dilKcult in the Old than
ii has been in the New, and may perhaps be found to be impossible.

 On the Geology of Lambay Island. By Messrs. Jukes and Du Noyer,

            On the Valentia Trap-District. By G. H. Kinahan.

   These traps occur in the Glengariff grit formation, and seem to have been con-

temporaneous with the aqueous beds. On the mainland, and on part of Begenish,

they are conformable ; and on the rest of Begenish, and on the Island of Valentia,
they are unconformable. The lowest place in the formation where they are observed
is to the south of Beenakeyraka, where they make their appearance as a dyke. It is
then lost under the bog and drift, but is seen again when we go east, at the north of

Glanleam, the seat of the Knight of Kerry. On Begenish, and the mainland, wo
meet with si.\ different volcanic periods. The first is greenish-white compact felstono,
which seems to be very local, as ic is only met with at one place. Second: green-

stone ash, which seems to have been very general, as it is found everywhere but
on the mainland. Third : felstone, either blue, black, or greenish. It is generally
separated from the last by a bed of altered slate, and has always, except on the main-
land, a bed of altered slate on the top of it. This bed of felstone is found every-
where when we get a section. Fourth : the great igneous action of the period, which
is a greenstone more or less felspathic. The centre of action would seem to have
been at the east of Begenish, as here, where the fault is marked, there is an uncon-
formability. It would seem also to have been near this place that the vent of the
previous irruptions had taken place, as they are all represented here. The dyke in
Valentia would seem to be the feeder that supplied this greenstone. It runs under
the Quarry Hill, not making its appearance from Beenakeyraka until you come to the
north of Glanleam, where it is lost in the sea opposite the Begenish traps. This bed
is also found on the mainland, and can be traced inland for about a mile. In places
it is in regular columns, and everywhere has a tendency to be columnar. Fifthly
compact felstone of a dark blue or purplish colour. It is found lying on the top of
the greenstone, but dies out as we go east. To the north it is slightly hornblendic,
but everywhere else it is a compact felstone. Sixthly : trappean breccia, which lies
on the top of the last. It is made up of pieces of all the foregoing traps, along with
slates and grits, imbedded in a green matrix. At Laght Point, and at the south-cast

of Begenish, there is a slight inversion.

   These rocks can be no longer looked on as azoic, as in these two localities they will

be found full of traces of organic life of three types at least. 1st. Zoopliytic : Okl-
hamia, of two species, which occurs in immense beds in Bray, Co. Wicklow, and
sparingly at Howth, Co. Dublin, where it was first discovered by the author in
IS.j?. 2nd. Annelidan: tracks of wandering worms, .(4>'e7iico/i<es, arranged in the

same direction as the bedding found both at Howth and Bray. Worm burrows, ver-

tical to the bedding, and arranged in pairs similar to those in the Longniyud,

trumpet- shaped burrow, bent up at the lower end: this occurs at Bray abundantly in
a Cambrian sea-beach. 3rd. Molluscan (.') : markings precisely similar to those so
called in the carboniferous slates. These are from Bray. The worm-tracks of Howth
do not appear to be identical with those of Bray. All the fossils at this latter place
would appear to have been deposited in shallow, quiet waters.

                                       O71 the genus Woodocrinus.

     By Prof. L. de Koninck, F.G.S. ; and Edward Wood, F.G.S.

   In the year 1854, when the genus Woodocrinus was first described, a single species
onl)' had been discovered.

   Since then so much attention has been paid to these fossils, that we have succeeded
in procuring three new species belonging to the same genus, the details of which
appear to be by no means less interesting than those of the species which formed the
type of the genus ; and they offer some peculiarities which tend to modify and com-

plete th.e characters which have been assigned to it.

  We therefore think that a reproduction of the published definition of this genus,

together with the modifications which the discovery of the new species has forced
upon our notice, will not be a work altogether unworthy of a short memoir.

                                      Genus Woodocrinus, Kon. 1854.

  --Generic characters. Basal plates 5. Subradial plates 5, alternating with the

basal plates. Radial plates 2x5:=10, united laterally. Interradial plates none.
Anal plates 8 to 20. Brachial pieces 4 to 10. Number of arms 10, bifurcating 1
to 5 times and furnished with pinnules. Joints of the stem cylindrical, tapering
towards the outer extremity. Dome composed of a great number of small hexagonal
plates, marked with star-like rays.

   The calyx* of this genus takes the form of a widely-opened cup, the base of which
is composed of five equal quadrangular plates, forming by their imion a star with
five rays. Alternating with and above these basal plates, is a row of five hexagonal
plates, which in their turn alternate with the first radial pieces, to the base of which
they are united by one of their sides. The radial pieces are two to each ray ; these
two pieces, the second of which is axillary, are cimeiform and of the same size and
shape; with the exception of those which are adjacent to the anal region, all these
pieces are jointed by their lateral edges, and show no trace of interradial pieces.
To each ray there is a single bifurcation, consequently ten arms. The number of
brachial pieces is variable; but of the species at present known, no specimen has less
than four or more than ten. The arms bifurcate from one to four and sometimes five
times, according to the species. The parts not laterally united are composed of alter-
nate articulations, on the interior sides of which are inserted the pinnules, each of
ten to twelve small pieces superposed one upon the othei", and with a length greater
than their breadth. The anal region is composed of a great number of plates (8 to
20), varying in each si)ecies. The dome appears to have been formed of small pen-
tagonal or hexagonal regular plates. The stem, of a variable length, is composed of
cylindrical articulations, alternately larger and smaller : its special character is, that,
unlike the stem of all other known Crinoids, it is much thinner at the base than at
the summit ; this circumstance would lead us to conjecture that the Woodocrinus
floated freely in the water, and that the stems were used to keep it upright while it

floatedt.

  * The nomenclature is that determined by MM. de Koninck and Le Hon, in their

Monograph of the Belgian Carboniferous Crinoids.
   t This pecuharity seems also to point out that the genus Woodocrinus may form a link

between the fixed Crinoids'and the adult state of the genus Conmtiila. Another conjecture
might be hazarded, viz. that these Crinoids were fixed on the rocks near tide-mark, and that

 --Relaiionn and (Vifferences. This genus, which has been named after the zealous

amateur who alone has brought the specimens to light, is related to the genera

Ci/athocrhius (Miller), Taxocrhius (PhilL), and Forbesiocriniis (Kon.). The charac-

ters which mark their differences are easy to distinguish.
   The Cyathocrinus has normally only four snbradial plates, while the Woodocrimts

has five, and the Taxocrimts, as well as the Forhesiocrinus, have none. Besides, the

principal rays of the two last genera are composed of more than two radial plates.
   The known species of this genus are Woodocrinus macrodactylus, Woodocrinus

expansus, Woodocrimts goniodactylus, and Woodocrinus dichodactylus.

 --1. AVooDOCRiNus MACRODACTYLUS. As this species has been fully described in a

notice on a nevv genus of Crinoids, read by M. de Koninck, February 1854, before the

WeAcademy of Belgium, it will not be necessary to enter into its details.                                                     would

here  only  add,  that  it is  by  far  the  most  common                                            the thin  limestone bed  of a very
                                                                                                  ;

limited area, in which this genus has alone been found, having as yet furnished but

very few specimens of the other three species, while its flags are covered with the stems,

arms, and calyces of the W. macrodactylus, twisted over each other, knotted, inter-

laced in almost inextricable confusion, and in such numbers as show that the ocean

where they lived was not less full of life, because its denizens were so special, than
those seas which have furnished to the naturalist genera much more numerous.

   It may be further added, that the above beds have furnished as yet no other fossil

except the Woodocrimts and a few teeth of Pelalodus Haslingsia and acuminatus

(Agass.).

 --2. Woodocrinus expansus. The calyx of this species is composed of plates which

bear a close resemblance to those of Woodocj-inus macrodactylus; their position is
exactly the same, and by their union they form a vase-like cup ; but the diameter of
these plates is greater, and they appear to be thicker and stronger than those of W.

macrodactylus.

   The basal plates are small, and the height of the exterior part is not equal to its
breadth. The articulated surface of the base is very broad, and forms with the

exterior surface, an angle almost equal to a right angle. The subradial plates are
equal in length and breadth. The length of the fu'St radial pieces is not equal to

their breadth. Their thickness appears to be considerable. The second radial pieces

are axillary and very short, though as broad as the first ; from each springs two
arms, one of which is genei*ally composed of three to four and the other of four or

five brachial pieces, which generally have a length three times that of their breadth.
Each arm gives origin to two primary brachial rays, composed of nine and five
brachial joints. The first is divided into two secondary rays, one bifurcating a»ain
once or twice before it attains its greatest length. The other, composed of about fifty
brachial joints, remains single. The second divides also into two secondary rays, one
bifurcating, the other single. The joints of these rays are almost semi-cylindrical,

with their breadth and length nearly equal, and alternately a little thicker on each
opposite side. The pinnules to which they give origin are exactly similar to those of
Woodocrinus tnacrodaciyhif;. The number of the ultimate rays of this crinoid is 80 to
100, and the total length of the arms is three times that of the calyx. The anal
region, the form of which can be but imperfectly distinguished, and that only in a
single specimen, appears to be composed of fewer plates than that of Woodocrimts
macrodactylus -jhut these plates are broader and thicker than those of the above species,
though their general disposition is the same. The dome imperfectly marked, and
that in but two specimens, appears to have been large, and composed of a great num-
ber of hexagonal united to pentagonal plates, having their surface ornamented with
stars in relief, not unlike the dog-toothed ornament of early English architectiu'e.
The proboscis of this species has not yet been found. The stem, in its general form,
and the form of its articulations, resembles that of the W. macrodactylus, but it is
usually larger and a little thicker.

  --Relations and differences. Woodocrinus expansus differs from W, macrodactylus

their flexible stems permitted their arms to rise and fall with the tide, and that when dead they
broke off, and the floating bodies were cast on the beach; which would account for the con-
fusion with which they seem thrown together, and for the absence of any fixed base to the

stems.

in tlie thickness of tlie plates which form the calyx, in the number and larger size of
the anal plates, and especially in the form and greater mnnber of the brachial rays,
the first having 100 while the last has but 20 of them, whilst the joints of these rayi;
in the first have a breadth equal to tiu'ir height ; in the second, wliere they are very

--short, the breadth is six times greater.
    Localily U'oodocrinns expansus is found associated with W. macrodactyliis, and
characterises the same beds.

  --3. VVooDocRiNUs GoNioDACTYLUs. In the form of the calyx and its plates this

species diifers little from the two preceding ones.
   The basal, the suhradial, and radial plates resemble those of Woodocrinvs macro-

daclybis. The axillary radial pieces are surmounted by two rays, each composed of
four joints, from the last of which spring two seco)idary rays, one of which attains its
full length without bifurcation, while the other branches otf into four small rays ; so
that each arm contains ten rays, principal and secondary, making a total of fifty.
These rays have these peculiarities, that they preserve the same breadth throughout

their entire length; that their dorsal or exterior side is angular; that the last axillary
joint of each ray is very large, and the joints thicken alternately at each opposite side,
l)roducing by their union a zigzag pallium, exactly like that which is found in some
species of Platycrhius and Aclinocriniis. The pinnules are delicate and a little more

distant than in the other species. The anal region is not known. The form of the
plates of the dome, of which but a small portion has been found, appears to be the
same as that of the analogous plates of the preceding species. The stem is composed
of cylindrical joints, so arranged that three smaller ones alternate with one larger one ;
this disposition gives to the stem an aspect quite different to that of the other species.
Though no perfect termination has yet been found to any of the stems, there seems no

--reason to doubt that they have the same character as those of its other known congeners.
    Relations and differences. The augular form of the brachial rays, the peculiar mode
in which the joints are articulated, as well as the diflTerent number of the rays, dis-
tinguish this species well from all the others.

  --Localily. The same as that of the two preceding species.
  --4. WooDOCRiNus DicHODACTYLUS. The fomi of the calyx of this species is less

open and a little more elongated than that of W. macrodactyliis, to which it has the

greatest resemblance.
    'i'hc basal plates are small, like those of W. macrodactyliis, and offer no peculiarity.

The suhradial plates are not so broad as they are long, and are produced in a slight
cup-like form. The first radial plates are as broad as they are long, and are closely
united to each other. The radial axillary pieces have a length greater than their
breadth, and are the principal cause of the elongation of the calyx : these axillary
pieces give origin to two brachial rays composed of nine joints, rounded on their dor-

sal aspect, the breadth of these joints being about one-third greater than their length.
The ninth joint is in its turn axillary, and from it spring two more rays, each com-
posed of twenty-five to thirty joints, which have one of their sides alternately larger
than the other. The breadth of these, like that of the joints of the primary rays, is

one-third greater than their length. The total number of rays is forty. The stem is
composed of joints nearly similar to each other; hence it has the appearance of being
more cylindrical and less ringed than that of W. macrodactyliis. Neither the anal

 the n-.imber of its rays, which are double that of the last, not less than by the greater
tenuity of those rays. It cannot be confounded with W. e.rpansus, on account of the
same distinctive characters and the length of its brachial pieces. The form of the

Nutice of the recent Advances of Palccontological Discovery in Tuscany.

        By Prof. Car. G. Meneghini, of the University cf Pisa.

   Tuscany is exceedingly rich in mineral products of every kind, and presents at tlic
same time an cxtraordinar)- number of stupendous geological plienomena. Indus-

trial interests and the love of science find there alil^e their inducement and reconi-
])ense. It were to be desired, for the greater prosperity of tlie mining operations,
that these were carried on with adequate capital, directed by an intelligent spirit of

association. But, with respect to the scientific researches, they are ardently pursued

by many amateiirs, and are every day bringing to light new treasures.

Especially the Paleontology of Tuscany has been enriched of late in an extraordi-

nary degree ; and the present communication is intended to give an outline of these
new discoveries.

   Under the name of Verrucano (previously employed by Targioni), Savi, beginning

with the earliest of his works, designated a vast formation which underlies the entire
series of the secondary rocks, and is composed of sandstones, quartzites, talcose-
schists, and arragonites, the series ending below in gneiss. This might, at that date,
have been identified in a general way with the red sandstone, but palaeontological
data were wholly wanting to characterize it more particularly. At present we know
the existence, in the middle part of this formation, of an anthracite deposit accom-

panied by casts of upwards of fifty species of Sigillaria, Calamites, Annularia, Astero-

pliyllUes,  Cyatheites, Neuropteris, Pecopteris, &c.,  in splendid  preservation                                                          and
                                                                                                                                       ;

all, or nearly all, capable of being positively identified with those of the other car-

boniferous beds. Besides this, in the strata of sandstone which accompany the

anthracite bed, there are found in abundance Cyathocriniis, Cyafhophyllum, Orlliis,

Leptaina, and Spirifer, of species equally distinguishable as belonging to the carbon-

iferous epoch, although a mineralogical equivalent of the mountain limestone is en-

tirely wanting. In this formation of the Verrucano, therefore, we are now enabled to

distinguish the presence of the two red sandstones, the Old and the New.

The first member of our secondary rocks is composed of a bituminous, black lime-

Westone, frequently converted into beautiful black marble, or into bardiglio.                                                             have

found in it numerous fossils, but in a state which does not favour their identification.

They seem, however, sufficient to characterize this limestone as Trassic, especially by

the presence of the Gervillia socialis.

   The series of the Lias and the Jura appear in Tuscany and in the neighbouring
regions of the rest of Italy, under conditions of the greatest interest. The straligraphic
and mineralogical succession in the anticlinal curves of the metalliferous chain is com-
posed of the following members in ascending order. First. White limestone passing
into marble, more or less crystalline, of great bulk, and elevated so as to constitute the
central nucleus of the anticlinal curve (Campiglia), or the most central of the peri-
pheric bands, in case the palaeozoic rocks also have been sufficiently elevated and
disrupted to constitute the central area (Apuan Alps, Montagnola Senese, Elba, Cayo
Argentaro). Fossil remains abound here in some spots, but are seldom recognizable

those which it has been possible to determine belong to the lower lias. Secondly.
Ammonitic red Hmestone, so called from the abundance of ammonites which it con-
tains, but which must not be confounded with other ammonitic red limestones in and out

of Italy, since the species which it includes are almost all of the section of the Arietes

it has in general but little thickness. Thirdly. Another limestone of a light-grey

colour, often including flint. The lower part of this affords, very sparingly,

ammonites of the same species as those of the subjacent red limestone, but in the

upper part we have very lately found a great number of ammonites, converted, for

the greater part, into liydratic oxide of iron, and of species completely diflTerent.

prehended under the name of " variegated," in which, before this time, there had not

Webeen any fossils found.  have recently discovered that the lower beds of these

schists, that is, those which are in immediate superposition to the grey limestone which

contains the altered ammonites, are full of casts of Posidonomya Bronnii.

The locality of La Spezia has long been known for the abundance of ammonites

discovered there by Guidoni, and illustrated by Sowerby in the work of De la Beche.

flexures and liy an extensive f';iult, yet the snine series exists, only the relative extent
of the different niincralogical formations is different ; the red and the light-grey lime-
stones being tlicre very little developed, while the variegated schists arc much more
so, and have a black liinestine interstratified with them, corresponding in position to
a marly limestone, which is found in other places, also interspersed among these
schists, and which is remarkable for the abundance of fucoids that it contains. This
Jurassic limestone with fucoids is not lo be confounded with tlie other succeeding
Cretaceous and Eocene limestones, of which we shall speiik hereafter, although the
species of these fucoids are in general very difficult to distingnish. Nor yet is this
black limestone, intercalated among the mottled schists of La Spezia (and which is cer-
tainly of the Jurassic period), lo be confounded with another fossiliferous black lime-
stone of the same locahty, which belongs to the cretaceous system, and to which also we
shall presently advert. It was just the confounding of these two limestones that gave
rise to so many discussions and to so man)' false interpretations respecting the struc-

ture of the western promontory of the Gulf of bpczia. Now the ammonites described
by Sowerby and many others, which occur at La Spezia in the lower beds of the

variegated schists, and in the black limestone therewith interstratified, are the same
as those which are to be found in a like position in the light grey limestone in the
Pisan Mountains. They are of species belonging to the Lias, and many of them have
been recently recognized at Hierlatz by Hauer. These same species of ammonites
of La Spezia, of the Monti Pisani, and of Hierlatz, have been also recently found in
a sparry limestone at Campiglia. There the variegated schists are wanting, and the
limestone occupies the fissures existing in the red ammonitic limestoue. Finall}',
another recent discovery has been made to complete the series; in the upper part of
the variegated schists of La Spezia, there have been found in great abundance, casts
of ammonites of species totall}' different from those already indicated, and perfectly
recognizable as belonging to the " Oxford clay."

   The black fossiliferous limestone which is in su])erposition to the Jurassic schists of
La Spezia, is represented in the Apuan Alps, and in the Monte Pisano, by a lime-
stone of like character, but rarely containing fossils. It is remarkable that in the same
locality of La Spezia, we find it, at the distance of a few paces, decidedly metamor-
phosed into a most beautiful Portovenere or Portoro marble, or into white dolomite,
and extremely rich in fossils exposed by the erosive action of the sea. In the Apuan
Alps this forins the second peripheric band, and constitutes the lofty summits of
the Pania, Pizzo d'tTccello, Pisanir.o, &c. The fossils which it includes prove it to
be cretaceous, but with regard to its synchronism with the rocks of other localities,
nothing more can be said than that it corresponds to the most ancient of the cretaceous
periods, which elsewhere has been called " Neocomian." The remainder of the cre-
taceous rocks of the Tuscan Ajjennine and of the metalliferous chain, is chiefly com-
posed of two mineralogical formations, a flaggy limestone, more or less arenaceous,
denominated " Pietra forte," which constitutes the material with which the city of
Florence is paved, and argillaceous schists frequently altered into lianile and jaspers,
in contact with the ophiolitic volcanic masses. These schists, locally denominated
" Galistri," also contain, more or less abundantly interspersed, a white, cream, or
lead-coloured limestone, denominated "Alberese;" and finally, there appear in it
beds of micaceous sandstone, " Macigno," which, at last prevailing over the schist
formation, constitutes the chief bulk of our Apennines. In many places the Albei-ese
limestone is partially replaced by some inconsiderable beds of nummulitlc limestone,
often containing nummulites of many species and well preserved, together with a
great quantity of the other fossils which usually accompany them ; sometimes, instead,
with the nummulites small or fragmentary, in which case it takes the name of " Cal-
care screziato." When this member of the stratigraphic series exists, we have the
means of distinguishing the portion of it, which, being lov^^er in position than the num-
mulitic band, belongs to the cretaceous system, from the upper part, which, together
with the nummulitic formation itself, ought rather to be considered as Eocene Tertiary.
But where there does not exist any nummulitic bed, as frequently happens, it is not
possible to draw any line of separation. It is to be observed, by the w^aj', that the
mineralogical character of the " Pietra forte" seems to resemble closely that of the
Macigno sandstone ; but not only are they in reality distinct, and their sf ratigraphical
position very distinct, but moreover it was in the Pietva forte that Micheli found the

famous Hamites which Savi named Hamites Miclielii ; and in the same, Count Carlo
Strozzi has lately discovered a very I'emarkable abundance of easily recognizable fossils,
Jnocerami, Ammonites, Crioceratites, Scaphiles, &c., besides very many other fossils
of strange and indeterminate forms, probably belonging to zoophytes and annelides.
Some of these fossils, as for instance Gorgonia Turgionii and Neinertelites Strozzi, as
well as niunerous fucoids, reappear, both above and below the nummulitic band, in the
Macigno limestone, in its accompanying schists, and in the Alberese limestone which

occurs alternately with it.
   Besides the lower part of the Eocene formation, thus intimately connected with the

cretacean system, an upper part may also be distinguished. This is chiefly argilla-

ceous and calcareous; and a disturbance of the crust, anterior to its deposition, con-

nected with the eruption of the ophiolite or diallagic serpentine, has occasioned a
local unconformability of stratification between the upper and lower parts of the
deposit. This upper Eocene formation is principally developed in a vast band on the

northern declivity of the Apennines. On the southern side, again, it is niucli less so,

or is chiefly calcareous, as in the valley of Tiberina, or else is entirely wanting. In
this last case there is a transition also in the miueralogical character, from the Eocene
Macigno to the Mollasse of the Miocene formation, which in every instance is con-
stantly conformable to the underlying Eocene. It is then distinguishable only by

the presence of the neogenic fossils.
   Three other principal mineralogical formations, besides that of the Mollasse, are

equally referable to theMiddleTertiary or Miocene, since they underlie the indubitable

subapennine formation, the type of the Pliocene. These are, fluviatile or estuary form-
ations, with abundant deposits of lignite, sometimes converted into anthracite (Monte
Bamboli) ; an ophiolitic rock, perfectly similar to that of the hill of Turin; and a
coarse limestone, extremely rich in fossils. The limestone formation contains numerous
remains of Anthracotherium and other pachydermata, of chelonians, and of plants
(Palms), which fix for it a high relative antiquity. The Calcaire grassier, on the
other hand, although decidedly in infraposition to the subapennine formation, and

unconformable to this (Rosignano), contains scarcely any other fossils but those of

the subapennine itself.
   This last, as is well known, is chiefly composed of the two mineralogical forms,

blue clay, and yellow sand and gravel. Athough in general these last overlie the clay,
yet their position and frequent alternations show that the two are to be looked upon

--as contemporaneous, with this difference only that the sands constitute a littoral

deposit, and the clays were deposited in a deeper sea. About a thousand species of

Mollusca and Radiata, in a fossil state, are found in this formation, to which are to be
added the Vertebrata and the plants. To this, in fact, belongs the famous bone-bed

of the upper part of the Val d'Arno, consisting of a lacustrine deposit, contem-
poraneous with the marine subapennine, in which also are found bones and complete
skeletons of the Mastodon and other large mammalia, besides not unfrequent remains

of Reptiles, Fishes, and Cetacea. Many casts of plants have lately been discovered as

well in these lacustrine deposits as in the marine littoi'al formation ; and this flora,
decidedly Pliocene (very soon to be published), will be of the utmost importance for
the means it will afford of comparison with the Miocene flora, and with that actually

existing.

   With respect to the Pliocene fauna, the great richness of which has been mentioned,

it is to be observed that every day it is found to comprise more and more of the species

which hitherto were believed to belong exclusively to the Miocene formation, or which

are now actually living in other seas.

To conclude, there is perhaps no place better adapted than Tuscany for the study

of the Pleistocene, which is even yet in the course of formation at some points of the

sea-coast, where waters charged with calcareous contents are still discharging them-

selves                              whilst at a more or less considerable distance from the sea, it blends its cha-
                                 ;

racters, mineralogical, stratigraphical, and palseontological, with the littoral Pliocene

formation. In the lower part of the Pliocene formation (in some places arenaceous,

and in others calcareous), known under the names of Tiifo and of Pancluna, are found

the remains of elephants, and the fossils pre-eminently subapennine ; in the upper

part are buried articles of human manufacture, together with shells of species still

living in our seas.

82 REPORT-- 1857.

    Ill terminating these cursory notices, it may perhaps be not amiss to subjoin a few

general considerations.

   It would appear that the niineralogical characters of rocks are infinitely more varied
and inconstant in Tuscany than anywhere else. The chief cause of the modifications
locally presented by sedimentary rocks, is the abundance of the volcanic masses, them-
selves also extremely diversified in their nature. The eruptions of these have taken
place in a chronological order, very marked and distinct, exhibited by the modifica-
tions they have induced in the various sedimentary rocks.

    Except the oldest granite, the protrusion of which is probably referable to the

palaeozoic epoch, all the other eruptions belong decidedly to the Tertiary period.

    The ophiolite or diallagic serpentine is the most ancient of them ; to this succeed

in  chronological order,  the euphotide or granitone ;  the  diorite  and ophite                                                    granite
                                                                                                                                 ;

with tourmaline ; the masses of siderolite and amphibolite ; the quartziferous por-

phyries ; the recent serpentine without diallage ; the trachytes ; and finally, the

basalts.

   The local disturbances partially produced by these eruptions do not correspond

either to the systematic divisions elsewhere established or to the palseontological

differences.

   The study of palaeontology reveals a slow and graduated transition from the most
ancient secondary strata up to these which are at present in course of formation, the
fauna of each successive period assuming its own marked and constant character,

while all are at the same time connected together by insensible transitions.
   Finally, in Tuscany also it is evident, and perhaps in Tuscany it was first perceived,

that the study of stratification is the only true key to open the secret and hitherto in-

accessible paths of geological chronology.

The Quartz Rocks, Crystalline Limestones, and Micaceous Schists of the

    North-ivestern Highlands of Scotland, proved to be of Lower Silurian Age,

    Bythrough the recent Fossil discoveries of Mr. C. Peach.          Sir Roderick

    I. MuRCHisoN, D.C.L., F.R.S.

   At the last Meeting of the British Association at Glasgow, I communicated my

opinion, founded on a survey with Professor Sedgwick in 1827, and confirmed by an
exploration with Professor Nicol in 1855, that the quartz rocks, limestones, and mica-

schists of Sutherlandshire, in which Mr. Peach had then detected a few imperfect

fossils, would prove to be of Lower Silurian age. This belief was mainly founded

--on the physical succession of the various rock-masses, which I described as follows

in the ascending order :

   1. An ancient gneiss in part highly granitoid or traversed by granite veins.
   2. Coarse grit and conglomerate of reddish colours (formerly mistaken for Old Red

Sandstone).

    3. Quartz rocks with intercalated limestones.

   4. Micaceous schists, &c., in parts almost gneissose, with quartz rock, &c.
   5. The great triple series of the Old Red Sandstone consisting of conglomerates and
sandstone at the base, the Caithness ichthyolite flags in the centre, and the sandstones

of Dunnet Head and the Orkneys above.

  My present view (as completed by the subsequent observations of Colonel James,

R.E. and of Professor Nicol in the summer of 1856, is, that the coarse red grit and
cono-lomerate No. 2 represents the Cambrian of the British Government Surveyors;
the quartz rocks, limestones, and micaceous schists, Nos. 3 and 4, having now proved
to be what I suggested, viz. Lower Silurian rocks.

   ]\Iy earlier sections and observations having led me to conclude that the base of the
Old Red Sandstone or Devonian rocks reposed transgressively and discordantly upon

those quartzites and mica-schists, I naturally infeiTed that if the Durness limestones
and quartz rock were Lower Silurian in a metamovphic state, the Upper Silurian was
omitted; thus accounting for the great solution of continuity which occurs.

  A recent discovery of Mr. C. Peach in the limestones of Durness has set the matter

--at rest : and as it has been a quastio rexuta, Mr. Hugh Miller having thrown out the

hvpothesis that these rocks might be metamorphosed equivalents of the Old Red and
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                              83

Caithness flags of the east coast, and Prof. Nicol having since suggested that they were

possibly of carboniferous age, or the equivalents of the sandstones and carboniferous

limestones of the South of Scotland (Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. vol. xiii. p. 36), it js

essential that my own view should be explained to the British Association, before

which body the subject has already undergone discussion.

The annexed Note demonstrates, that the fossil shells last collected by Mr. Peach,

and which he sent to me, are forms which characterize one of the lowest zones of

the Silurian rocks of North America ; and therefore the palasontological evidence is

in accordance with that of the physical geologist.

1 would here observe, that in tracing the Silurian rocks to the north and west, we

begin to find North American types which are unknown to us in the Silurian region

or in any part of England and Wales. Thus, in the South of Scotland, the Madurea

magna (Hall) is a well-known Ayrshire fossil, and in Ireland the Isotclun g'tgas

(Dekay) is not unfrequent, and these are species which do not range further south-

ward or eastward. It is therefore peculiarly interesting to find in a still more northern

tract, a zone which is as low in the series of metamorphosed rocks in which it occurs,

as the Canadian and North American calciferous sand-rock is in the regular and un-

altered deposits of those countries.

As this notice is to be read at the Dublin Meeting, I venture to recall the attention

myof my Associates to the hypothesis which I put forth in  work, ' Siluria' (1854),

viz. that the quartz rocks, micaceous schists and marbles, grey and green, of the

Bins of Connemara in Galway, are also nothing more than metamorphosed ' Lower

Silurians.' It is true, that no organic remains have yet been detected in any portion

of these rocks, though perchance, if their weathered surfaces were searched by as keen-

eyed a collector as Mr. Peach, they might afford such evidences.

  My belief is founded on the fact, that the fossils found near Leenane, Maam, and

other places, are none of them of higher antiquitj' than the Llandovery rocks (Middle

Silurian), and merely indicate a passage downwards; so that the crystalline rocks

which dip regularly beneath these fossil-bearing rocks may well represent the Caradoc

or Bala formation, and the Llandeilo and Lingula flags, in a metamorphosed condition.

       Note on the Fossils from Durness. By J. W. Salter, F.G.S.

    It had given no little trouble, which had yet no satisfactory result, to examine and
decide upon the fragments formerly collected in these altered limestones. There
were always some reasons for regarding them as Lower Silurian forms, although the
first reference of any of them to that period was only made with a wide margin for
doubt. And so like were some fragments to those of chambered shells, and even
Goniatites, that it was impossible quite to rebut Professor Nicol's notion that the whole
might prove of carboniferous age, though the grounds on which he stated that belief

(the presence of Stigmaria for instance) were far from satisfactory. Quart. Geol.

Journ. vol. xiii. p. 36.
   Mr. Peach's specimens, however, furnish us with a fortunate coincidence with

some of the yet unpublished fossils of Canada, for a knowledge of which we are
indebted to Sir VV. Logan's zeal in bringing over his whole collection to England for

purposes of comparison. (See Quart. Geol. Journ. vol. viii. p. 201.) In Canada, the
rock which immediately overlies the Potsdam sandstone, viz. the calciferous sand-

rock, contains only a few fossils, but these are characteristic of the horizon. Among

them is a genus or subgenus allied to the Raphistoma of Hall, which has received the
name OphUeta from Vanuxem, and consists of species which have a very wide open
umbilicus angular at the edge, and with straight sides to the whorls.

   In Durness the same genera and even species has been found. The Canadian speci-
mens are far larger than the British ones, but show the same characters, and the name
OphUeta compacia hasbeen applied to them in MSS. and will be published in the Deca'i,' -
of the Canadian Survey. With them, in Canada, occurs a peculiar Eiiomphalus, or
some s\ich genus, to which the term Madurea matutina is applied by Hall. And I
cannot distinguish certain flattened spiral shells (with the same proportions) in the
Scotch collection, from these. Again, there is a Pleiirotomaria very like the P. suhco-
nica. Hall, from the Trenton limestone. The Scotch fossil resembles it in shape and
in the position of the band, but has narrower whorls. Another Trenton limestone

form occurs in tlie presence of move tlinn one species of Oncoceras, Hall. The British
specimens have closer septa than tjiose of North America, but are otherwise much
like. Thus, while there is but one, or perhaps two identical species, the character
of the fossils is so very similar to th;it of the lower limestones of America, often con-
founded (as we learn from Sir W. Logan) in a single calcareous band, that one is
tempted to concliule that the succession in N.W. Scotland, a thick limestone reposing
on a quartzite full of fiicoidal markings (Nicol, /. c), can be nothing else but the equi-
valent of the calcareous series of Canada, with its underlying Potsdam sandstone.

     0« the Junction of the Mica-slates and Granite, Killincy Hill, Dublin.
                      By George V. Du Noyer, M.R.I.A.

The junction of the mica-slates and granite at Killiney Hill offers many points of

interest to the geologist. Where the slates are in immediate contact with the granite

they have become highly micaceous, and crystals of a mineral closely resembling

Andalusite, as well as Audnlusite itself, occur in great abundance, in some places so

much so as to form a constituent of the rock. Crystals of garnet are also very common

in these rocks. Throughout the entire boundary of the slates and granite, the former

Lave a persistent dip to the east and south-east, and are singularly free from contor-

tions, showing that where tlie granite acted on them its force was applied slowly, and

while it was in a fluid or at least a pasty condition from heat ; no violent disturbance,

but a steady upheaving force, which acted uniformly on the hardened massof the slates,

aud metamorphosed without crushing them : examples on a small scale, showing this,

are to be seen on the shore under Obelisk Hill.

   The slates which belong to the Lower Silurian group are not cleaved but foliated
large wedge-shaped masses of them, many hundred yards in length, are included in

the granite; and the author explained, that when two such rocks were injunction

along the flanks of mountain ranges, the detached portions of the slate might be com-

pared to almonds on the surface of a pudding; not that tliey penetrated to any great

depth into the granite mass, as was the idea entertained formerly by some geologists,

although they may appeal- to be interstratified with it in bands.

Along the shores of Killiney Bay, lumps of granite are found containing galena, a

small vein of which is observed in the slates close to their contact with the granite east
of Killiney Railway Station. West of Toronto Terrace, the granite in some places is

full of plumose mica. In the true granite north of the rock called Black Castle, a

large vein of euritic granite occurs, 40 yards thick, with many smaller veins formed
chiefly of quartz and felspar. Many instances were given of euritic or Elvanite veins

which cut through the granite and slates, being themselves traversed by newer eurites.

The elvanite or euritic granite veins are often faulted, and the cracks thus formed

filled up with infiltrated quartz.
   Thin parallel veins of elvanite are often bounded at either side by a thin layer of

semi-transparent sub-crystalline quartz, possibly the result of segregation from the

elvanite as it shrunk in the process of cooling.

   M. Du Noyer directed attention to a dyke- like tongue of granite in the hill north of

Killiney Park, 3 feet 6 inches wide, which traverised the slates in a north and south

direction. This dyke is cut across by elvanitic veins, which do not extend into the

adjoining slates. He accounted for this singular fact by supposing that the main mass

of the granite is close at hand below the surface, that the slates offered more resistance

to forces disturbing both, and that the elvanite followed the lines of least resistance.

The mica is very dark-coloured, and along the east wall of the dyke it is arranged in

fine and well-defined laminae oblique to the wall.

At a quarry north of the garden wall of Killiney Park, the junction of the slates and

granite is well exposed. Here the dark mica assumes a remarkable appearance in

the granite, being arranged in fine waved parallel lines which follow the direction of

the  boundary  wall  of  the  granite,  and  therefore  dipping  east  at  about  45°                    hence  the
                                                                                                      ;

granite here has a stratified look. This singular foliation, as it may be called, of the

mica crystals in the granite is best developed at the distance of a few feet from the

slates, but it extends into the mass of the rock for the distance of about 20 feet, when

it gradually dies out and the granite assumes its normal appearance ; close to the

slates the mica in the granite is disposed in small but well-defined blotches for the

distance of 18 inches, giving the rock a mottled look. In otlier places along the shores
of and over Killiney Hill, the granite, at its contact with the slates, exliibits a thin

layer of well-developed crystals of mica.
    In our present state of information regarding the chemical or mechanical action

which would take place in a heated granite being brought on a large scale into rela-
tion with a cold mass of slates, it is difficult to account for the appearance which the
granite presents at Killiney Park Quarry ; doubtless the appearance which the mica
now presents is the result of a i-e-arrangement of the crystals, and is, in short, a meta-
morphism.

General Sketch of the Districts already visited by the Geological Survey of

  India. By Thomas Oldham, A.M., F.R.S., G.S., 4c, Svperintendent

   of the Geological Survey of India.

   The labours of the Geological Survey of India have been conducted hitherto under
great difficulties. More recently, however, the liberality of the Government of India
has greatly extended the establishment of the survey, and Mr. Oldham trusted that their
future progress would be rapid and effective. 'I'he only general sketch-map of the
geology of India which they had was that published by the late Mr. Greenough. This
was a work of great value, and gave abundant pi-oof of the extent and labour of its
author in its compilation. As might be anticipated under the circumstances, it was full
of errors ; and perhaps few could speak more confidently of this than himself. But
at the same time it was a most valuable contribution, and would prove a most useful
guide to future observers. The officer of the Geological Survey had examined several
districts of considerable area in detached positions, and the results which he was able
to lay before the Section might therefore appear less connected than he could wish.
But every day would tend to unite them more closely ; and his object was now simply
to report progress, and to show that something had been done to elucidate the struc-
ture of India. Referring first to the districts to the east of the Bay of Bengal, the
Tenasserim Provinces extend for about six degrees of latitude along the east shores
of the Bay of Bengal. In breadth they seldom exceed more than one degree of lon-
gitude. From Siam, on the east, these provinces are separated by an interrupted
range of mountains, occasionally rising to 7000 or 8000 feet high, but the general
height of which is to the north about 4000, diminishing in passing southwards to
3000 feet or less. The main direction of this range is north and south ; this being
also the general direction of the coast line, of the minor and outlying ranges of hills,
and therefore of the rivers. The geological structure is tolerably simple, although
at first sight apparently complicated, from the great disturbances to which the rocks
have been subjected. The central range is of granite, occasionall}-, but not frequently

of syenitic character ; itself traversed by thick veins of large crystalline felspathic
granite, and often along its outer edges, or near its junction with overlying slates,
characterized by the presence of tinstone as an ingredient of the mass disseminated
among the other mineral constituents. This granite axis is succeeded by highly
metamorphic rocks of gneissic and micaceous character, themselves cut up by nume-
rous veins of granite, which, however, do not extend far from the junction. Upon
these is a great accumulation of bluish and bluish-black earthy beds, thinly laminated,
of thin-bedded grits, and of pseudo-porphyritic rock, the normal character of which is
an earthy hard rock with small irregularly disseminated sub-crystalline felspar, pass-
ing, on the one hand, into slates, and, on the other, into grits, often coarse and con-
glomeritic. These harder rocks form all the higher grounds of the outer ranges of
 hills. This series, being best seen in the southern province of Mergui, has been pro-
visionally called the " Mergui" series. The total thickness is about 9000 feet. It is
succeeded unconformably by hard sandstones in thick and massive beds, with their

Aearthy partings, generally of reddish tints, occasionally deep red and yellowish.

 few beds are slightly calcareous, and in the upper portion a few thin and irregular
 bands of earthy blue limestone occur. Above these rest about 200 feet of soft sand-
 stone in thin beds, upon which apparently rests the massive limestone of the country
so largely seen near to Moulmein. The thickness of the entire group is about 6000
 feet, and as some of its members are but seen in the northern province of Moulmein,
 I have provisionally called it the "Moulmein" series. To determine the age of the
--86 REPORT 1857.

older of these two groups (the Mergui) we have no data. The aspect of much of the

rocks is very similar to the trappean ashes and felstones so abundant in the Silurian

rocks of this country, while others are lithologically like Devonian; but these resem-

blances are very deceptive. The age of tlie Moulmein series is, however, tolerably

defined by its organic contents. These appear to fix the age of the group as distinctly

carboniferous. The whole of these rocks were, subsequently to their induration and

disturbance, widely and greatly denuded, and on their upturned edges at intervals is

found a series of conglomerates and sandstones and imperfectly coherent shales, with

thick beds of coal, generally of lignitic character. None of the conglomerates are

coarse;  the sandstones are fine,  gritty,  and  pebbly,  or  clean  white  quartzose grits
                                                                                                                                                ;

Ihe shales thinly laminated ; the coal itself thinly disposed in thin flaky laminas, with

earthy streakings marking its structure. In addition to the total unconformity of

these rocks, the imbedded organic remains are quite distinct. They consist of dico-

tyledonous plants (leaves) belonging to the group of the Laureacese, and probably to

the genus Laurophyllum of Goppert. In the thin papery shales which overlie the coal

are also remains offish (scales, he.) of freshwater character; the whole referring the

beds to a very recent epoch, probably corresponding in part to the pliocene of Euro-

pean geologists. It is curious to notice here the absence of any coal in the carboni-

ferous rocks below, and its abundant presence in those newer beds. The total thick-

ness of these beds does not exceed 900 to 1 000 feet. They are never continuously

traceable; they occur heaped up against and separated by the projecting ridges of the

higher grounds, and must have been deposited when the physical conformation of the

country was very similar to that now existing. They appear to be the result of a

series of freshwater deposits, formed in small lake-like expansions along the lines of

the great drainage valleys of the country ; and to mark a line of general and greater

depression between the main ridge of hills dividing Siam from the British dominions,

and the outer ridges which occur between this and the sea. The direction of the

main drainage of the country is determined, as already remarked, by the direction of

these ranges, and is discharged into the sea through narrow rocky gorges, which

have a direction nearly east and west, and which are due to lines of breakage and dis-

location. To this is due the sudden alteration in the direction of the courses of the

larger rivers, as may be seen on maps. Rocks similar to those situated in the Tenas-

serim provinces extend northwards up the course of the Salween River, and into the

adjoining districts of Burmah, to the north-east of Pegu. And, again, close to the

capital of Burmah, and stretching nearly north and south, as far as examined, high

ridges of metamorphic rocks are again met with, consisting of gneiss, micaceous

schists, and highly crystalline limestones, occasionally of a fine white colour, and

largely used by the Burmese for sculpture. But the great valley of the Irrawad}' is,

throughout a very large extent of its course, bounded on either side by a thick series

of rocks, chiefly sandstones, but with massive limestones also, which are locally rich

in fossils, and which, from this evidence, may be clearly referred to the eocene period.

These stretch on both sides of the river as far north as Pugahu, beyond which the

higher grounds recede from the river banks ; but they are in all probability continued

thence into Munipoor, and so united with the nummulitic rocks of the Khasi and

Cachar Hills. These rocks have been considerably disturbed and broken, but have a

general and prevailing strike nearly north and south, which strike, throughout many

iniles, has determined the general course of the River Irrawady. Their thickness

is considerable, certainly exceeding 5000 feet. Above these eocene rocks, and rest-

ing upon them with slight unconformity, is a series of beds of no very great thickness,

characterized by an abundance of gypsum disseminated in thin layers and veins, and

in the lower beds of which occur the deposits of clays and of vegetable matter, from

which are derived the larger supplies of petroleum. These rocks are well seen at

Senan Kyoung ("stream of foetid water"), and are traceable northwards to near

Amarapura. In the beds which appear to form the uppermost part of this group, but

which may possibly belong to another and distinct series, ai-e found some of the fossil

bones of the larger animals which occur abundantly in this district. About forty

miles north of Amarapura we again meet with sandstones, shales, and coal, resting un-

conformably on the metamorphic rocks, and characterized by remains of dicotyledo-

nous trees similar to, if not identical with, those found in the coal-yielding group of

Jhe Tcnasscrim provinces, and which are therefore referred to the same age (pliocene),

WeThis series, so far as examined, proved of no great extent or thickness.  pass now

to the Khasi Hills, which form a comparatively isolated range, rising suddenly from the
great plains of Bengal in the south, and divided in the north by the valley of Assam

from the great Himalaya or Bhotan range. On the southern face this range rises

almost perpendicularly from the plains, which are continuous from the Bay of Ben-

gal, with scarcely a perceptible change of level to the very foot of the hills, and, with

the exception of a comparatively small thickness of metamorphic rocks at the base,

are composed of nearly horizontal beds of sandstones, a few shaly layers, and limestone,

long known for the abimdance and beauty of the nummulites it contains. 'J'hese

beds dip slightly to the south, and die out towards the north, when the metamorphic

rocks come to the surface in the hills. Disregarding here any details as to the older

rocks, the age of the sandstones and limestones is unquestionably fixed by their organic

contents, and therefore, also, the epoch of the coal, which is associated with them, as

belonging to the great eocene period of geologists. No newer group of rocks is defi-

nitively seen in these hills. Along the southern face of the range there is evidence

of a great dislocation extending for many miles, and possibly along the entire scarp,

which has brought down to the level of the plains the rocks which are seen at the top

of the hills. This line of dislocation has in all probability tended to give the nearly

rectilinear direction of the escarpment; its date is fixed as at least subsequent to the

formation of all the eocene rocks here seen. An older group of sandstones, consider-

ably altered, is seen further to the north, within the hills, and also a series of highly

metamci-phosed schists and grits resting upon the gneissic and granite rocks ; but the

details of these are reserved. Passing thence still further to the north and east, at

the base of the Sikkim Himalayas, under the hill station of Darjiling, another section

Wiis described. The great mass of the lofty hills is here composed of schistose rocks

of various characters, considerably disturbed and contorted. These, although hitherto

coloured similarly, and considered as of the same age, were decidedly different from,

and more recent than, the gneissose rocks of the greatest portion of India. Near the

base of the hills, and faulted against these rocks at high angles, there is a small extent

of sandstone and black shales, which contain Vertebrata, Pecopteris, &c., similar to

those occurring in the great coal-fields of Bengal. These fossils are peculiarly inter-

fisting, from the fact of their being changed into graphite, and occurring in beds

which themselves have a very strongly marked graphitic character. They are of very

limited extent; the greater portion of the sandstones, which in this section exhibit a

thickness of some thousand feet, belonging to a series of much more recent date, and

which has been subjected to a much smaller amount of disturbance and alteration.

The exact relation of these, too, it has not been possible to observe. This upper

group contains many large stems, in all observed cases prostrate, and in most cases

giving evidence of great wear and long exposure previously to being imbedded; and

in some of the finer and more earthy deposits an abundance of leaves occurs, of the

same general character as those already noticed as occurring in Burmah and Tenas-

serim. This group was therefore provisionally referred to the same age (pliocene).

No traces of the great nummulitic series had been observed in this district. In the

more central portions of India three very large districts had been examined, to which

he would now refer. One of these was to the south of Calcutta, in the district of

Cuttack; the second included all the country between the great coal-field of the Da-

inoodah, which had previously been mapped by Mr. Williams, and the River Ganges,

extending northwards to Hajmahal and Bhagulpore ; and the third extended along

the valley of the Nerbudda from west of the Hosungabad to many miles east of Jub-

bulpur. For the details of the first of these he was indebted chiefly to his able assist-

ants, Messrs. Blandford; for the last to Mr. Jos. Medlicott, who had very zealously

worked it out, having to carry on the formation of a topographical map at the same

time. In all these cases the sedimentary rocks, to which he would refer, formed

portions of a series once more widely extended, and probably continuous over the
whole country, now separated by denudation, from removal by which they have been

in great part protected, by being faulted into and against the highly metamorphic

gneiss, &c. which surround them. The Talcheer field extends for about 70 miles

from east to west, with an average breadth of 15 to 20 miles, and is bounded both on

Hie north and south by great parallel faults, the former of which has an aggregate

0now of upwards of 2000 feet; these faults are not truly east and west, but to tho

south of east and north of west. The section in ascending order of the basin shows

at the base sandstone and bhie shale, but sHghtly fossihferous in thickness from 500

to 600 feet; over these is a series of shales and sandstones often micaceous, occasional

beds of ironstone, and thin layers of coal and coally shale, giving a total thickness of

about 1800 feet; and over these again is a distinct series of quartzose grits, conglo-

merates, and sandston:>s, in thickness from 1600 to 2000 feet. These three groups

are  unconformable  each                            to   the  other                           the  unconformity  between  the  two  lower  being,

however, much less marked than that between the two upper. To the lower group,

as having been first recognized and described in this district, the name of " Talcheer "

series  has been  given                             the  second  group,                       which,  from  its imbedded    vegetable remains,

was proved to be identical with the rocks of tlie extensive Damoodah coal-field when

these were first described, has been denoted the " Damoodah" series; while the upper

group, supposed to represent the great series of rocks, so magnificently seen in the

Mahadeva Hills of Central India, has been called the " Mahadeva" series. Thus

these series can be recognized in each of the extensive fields referred to, although with

varying developments and thicknesses. At the base of the Talcheer series there is a

remarkable bed, consisting of very large and only slightly rounded masses of granite

and gneiss, imbedded in a fine silt, and occurring under such conditions as induce the

opinion that the action of ground ice has been the cause of its formation. In the

Rajmahal district, there is a very limited development of the lower beds, above which

unconformably comes the Damoodah series, here exhibiting a greater extension up-

ward than in Cuttack ; but unfort\inately the sequence of the rocks is interrupted by

the intercalation of several successive floes of basaltic trap, the intervals between

which have been marked by the continued and tranquil deposition of the mechanical

rocks going on. These floes have been repeated six or seven times, and the pheno-
mena of contact are in all cases marked; the upper layers of the mechanical deposits

in contact with the trap being in all cases greatly altered, while the lower layers are

in no cases changed, but rest unaltered on the degraded surface of the underlying

trap. But while the actual physical sequence of the deposits cannot be here traced,

the fact of their all belonging to the same great series is attested by the occurrence of

Asome identical fossils throughout.                                                           few species pass upwards through the series,

but there is a very marked change in the general facies of the flora in the upper as

compared with the lower portion of the group ; the latter characterized by the abun-

dance of Pecopteris, &c., the former by the abundance of zamia-like plants. The

series, therefore, has been divided into Upper and Lower Damoodah rocks. For

the details of the structure of the district, reference was made to the maps. In the
Nerbudda district the series was less interrupted, and there also the same general

results were obtained. The southern boundary of this great field was for a large

part of its coiu'se produced by a great fault, having, qxam prox'ime, the same general

direction as that of the faults bounding the Talcheer field. The age, geologically

Aconsidered, of these Damoodah rocks was briefly referred to.                                                             large series of draw-

ings of the fossil plants from them were exhibited, and the fact of the general oolitic

facies of this group, especially of those from the upper beds, pointed out. The

diflSculty of the question was alluded to, especially in connexion with the disco-

very, on the one side, of several species identical with those found in these Indian

rocks in the Australian coal-fields, associated with numerous animal remains distinctly

referable to the lower carboniferous                             era                               and, on the other hand,  with the discovery
                                                                                    ;

in Cntch of other species, also identical with some of these Indian forms, in beds

associated with animal remain^, undoubtedly referable to the oolitic epoch. It must,

I'.owcver, bo borne in mind that the latter fin-ms, or those which the evidence of asso-

ciated animal remains would show to be oolitic, are only found in the upper beds of
the Damoodah series, while those which are common to the Australian fields are those

chiefly found in the lower beds. Unfortunately, no animal remains whatever have

been found with these plants in the districts examined, excepting some annelide tracts

useless as distinctive forms. He preferred, under these circumstances, waiting for

further evidence before giving any definite opinion as to the age of this widely-ex-

tended and important gi-oup of rocks. Mr. Oldham then stated that there seemed

good reason for separating altogether from the several groups of rocks to which he
had referred the whole of the great thickness of sandstones which formed the great

Vindhyan range, extending almost entirely across India, from the mouths of the
--

Nerbudda to the Ganges at Monghyr. These appeared to be of prior date, and there
was a probability that there was a great line, or a group of hues, of dislocation pass-
ing along the general line of the valley of the Nerbuddiij and the effects of which
might be traced over a very large area, extending towards the north-east, possibly

even into the Valley of Assam. Besides the examination of these districts, which
together included an area of more than 30,000 square miles, the Geological Survey had

been able to add to the knowledge of the structure of the country in other ways. 1. An

excellent selection of fossils from the neighbourhood of Verdachellum in Madras, for
which they were indebted to Brooke Cunliffe, Esq., who had been associated with the
Rev. Mr. Cay in the first examination of these fossils, had enabled them to add largely
to the lists of Forbes, and to establish more conclusively than before the cretaceous

age of these deposits. 2. The exertions of Captain Keatinge at Mundlaiser, to whom
Mr. Oldham had pointed out the interest of the inquiry, had collected a good set of
organic remains from the limestone at Bang, to the west of Mhow, which had enabled
him to fix the age of those deposits as contemporary, or nearly so, with the cretaceous

beds of Trichinopoly and Verdachellum. This discovery gives rise to many import-
ant speculations as to the age of other beds, and also as to the epoch of the elevation
of all Central India; but more data were required before these could fairly be entered

upon.

    In this communication the author gives the detailed succession of beds in a section
from Sibyl's Head on the north to Dunquin and Machin Mountain on the south, and

shows from the fossil succession, as had also been demonstrated by Mr. G. Du Noyer

from sections, that,

    1. There is no evidence of a great anticlinal arch, including the whole of the Silu-
rian beds, nor of a double antichnal divided by the mass of Clogher Head (there is
however, a great flexure and fault at this point), but rather the underlying rocks, Silu-
rian and Lower Devonian, taken in a rough sense, lie in a rude, faulted and broken
synclinal, the lowest beds being respectively at Sibyl's Head on the north, and at the
Bull's Head promontory east of Dingle, on the south.

   2. The Wenlock and Ludlow formations are present, each well-developed, and
very much like those of Britain, with some diflerences in the distribution of the fos-
sils. The Choneies lata, for example, a characteristic Ludlow fossil in Britain, i3
here liiost abundant in the lower Wenlock beds. Many common trilobites and shells
also occur in it. Great coral beds (chiefly Favosites pobjmorpha) distinguish the
Wenlock series, with abundance of a large Spirifer, S. bijugosus, and of Aviculae pecu-

liar to the district.

   Pentamerus Knightii, Rkynchonella navicida, with several species of corals, mark

--the upper or Ludlow series; and there is a mass of /«co«/-bearing strata very re-
--markable and persistent between the Ludlow and Wenlock series. At Bull's Head

promontory, beds with Pentameri occur beneath Wenlock strata; and though these
cannot be connected with the beds to the nortliward, there is reason to think them the
equivalents of the beds at Sibyl's Head (which underlie the old red conglomerates),
and that they are here brought up by enormous faults.

    Lastly, attention is drawn to the fact, that this is the only Upper Silurian district of
Ireland ; that of Uggool, county Mayo, being rather the uppermost beds of the great

Llandovery or May Hill sandstone series, so fully developed in Connemara.

         On Erosion of Rivers in India.
By Hermann and Robert Schlagintweit.

   Amongst the phscnomena which characterize the course of large tropical rivers, and
which, although not entirely wanting in European rivers, are still but very imperfectly
developed in them, are the considerable alterations in their amount of water, recurring
periodically at various seasons of the year, the amount of their suspended matter, and
especially the astonishing vastness of their erosions. The erosion of the rivers consists

in their constantly deepening their beds, and thus slowly, but constantly receding

from the general surface.
    It is indeed the erosion that is most highly and generally developed in Indian

rivers, both in their lower course in the plains, and especially in their middle and

upper course in the mountains, in the Himalaya and in Tibet. When correctly

recognized and determined, it is moreover interesting, because it furnishes important

data for the explanation of many geographical, geological and physical conditions.
   But before referring to some of the numerous phsenomena which stand partly in

intimate connexion with the erosion of rivers, and are partly an immediate conse-

quence thereof, we venture to illustrate the vastness and universal extension of the
erosion of Indian rivers by a few examples and numbers.

   The erosion is greatest in the upper course of the river, in the mountains. But
even in the plains it is generally recognisable, and even here it not unfrequently

attains a magnitude of 80 to 120 feet.

But in the' Himalaya and Tibet the average magnitude of the erosion of the rivers,

even the small ones, amoimts to 1200--1500 feet, frequently exceeds 2000 feet,

and in some cases, as in the upper course of the Ganges, the Sutlej and the Indus,
even attains the extraordinary magnitude of 3000 feet, or, to express ourselves more

generally, the bed of each of these rivers was originally in the most extreme cases,

3000 feet higher than at present; and a stratum, partly of solid rock, partly of allu-

vium of a thickness of 3000 feet, has been removed.

These relative magnitudes were so surprising, and the effects of erosion in general

were so new a subject of investigation, that we had at first much difficulty in find-

ing those data which might guide us in the definitive determination of the mag-

Anitude of the erosion.  summary of the various to])ographical forms which served

us as well-defined starting-points in the determination of the magnitudes, with a short

discussion of the value of each of these forms, may not be without interest.

The most essential positive data for the determination of erosion are:

    Spoon-shaped erosions in the walls of valleys ; detritus, partly different from, partly
identical with those still occurring in the river (which are often deposited on level
surfaces) ; and connected lines of conglomerates of sand and freshwater shells along
the steep w-alls of the valleys. In the Himalaya and in Tibet these often occurred,
most distinctly marked, at elevations exceeding the level of the present bed of the

river by 3000 feet.
    In the most various rivers, and under tlie most midtifarious conditions, some, but

certainly not all the forms which we have just cited as characteristic of erosion, were
always present, so that we were able in almost all jdnces to measure the erosion
directly, and to determine it more accurately than the subject would lead one to expect.

   In the plains, as has already been mentioned, the magnitude of the erosion is much

less, namely 80 to 120 feet, but the form is perfectly different.
   From the Kaveri, Pener, Kistna and Godavery, in the south of India, and from the

rivers of central India up to the plain of the Ganges, all the rivers have a distinctly
marked bed of erosion, in which two stages are to be distinguished; one for the average

height of the lower or ordinary height of water; and the other, the rainy river-bed, for

the maximum height of the water.
   The magnitude of the rainy river-bed is astonishing; in the lower course of the

Ganges, the Brahmaputra and the Indus, it sometimes amounts to three or four miles,
whilst the bed for the average-water level is about one mile in breadth. It is remark-
able that the rainy river-bed increases in relative size the smaller the regular bed of

   During nine months of the year the river runs in its regular bed, whilst its rainy

especially ; but on others, as on the Indus and Sutlej, occupied by fine sand and shells,

forming barren zones along their shores.
   The overflow of the river commences v^fithin a few days after the commencement

of the rainy season ; as the rainy season increases, it swells so rapidly, that by careful

observation, even without instruments, the increase of the river may be traced front

iiour to hour, like the rising of the sea during the tide of flood, until after uninter-
rupted rain, it completely fills both its ordinary bed and its rainy river-bed, and then

has a breadth of four to five miles, a magnitude which is even far exceeded by many

rivers.

   The small rivers swell in the same way as the large ones, but, as we have remarked

above, the rainy river-bed being larger, in proportion as the river is smaller, impass-

able streams are now produced, where a few days before there stood small pools filled

with water scarcely an inch in depth.

   So long as the river only fills its rainy river-bed, although it may be four or five
miles broad, this rise has not by any means become an inundation. The mass of water
is completely enclosed between the two sides of the rainy river-bed. An inundation
only takes place, when the river, being swollen by unusually continuous rains, or by a

greater melting of the snow in the mountains, rises above its rainy bed, which is en-
closed by high banks, and then covered the neighbouring plains like a lake. Unlike
the rivers of Europe, destructive inundations are rare in most Indian rivers.

   The commencement of the formation of deltas is situnted where the periodical rise
of the river somewhat exceeds the height of the rainy bed. Inundations, btit of a
harmless kind, occur here regularly every year, as, for example, to the south of Dacca
and Berhampoor in Lower Bengal.

   But in the upper parts of almost any large river district, inundations do not occur
regularly, but only occasionally, and they both take place suddenly and leave destruc-
tive effects behind them. One of the greatest inundations took place along the Indus
in the summer of 1856, in its middle course between Dera Ismael Khan and Mithan-
kot, where the river attained a breadth of nearly seven miles, its regular rainy bed
extending two miles in breadth ; and where, in the winter of 1856-57, after the lapse of
six months, we saw profitable fishing going on in pools and channels which the Indus
had left behind in its return, in places where for yeai-s only corn had grown.

   That the phienomeha of erosion in the plains should so many times e.^ceed similar
phenomena in Europe, may be satisfactorily explained here by the magnitude of the
mass of water and its periodical accumulation at particular seasons of the year.

    It is more difficult, however, to explain the enormous erosions in the mountains in
the north of India. In the Himalaya itself the quantity of rain is one of the most
essential causes, but here, as in Tibet, the narrowness and steepness of the valleys
combine with this to increase the action extraordinarily. Hence it is that the entire
eroding force of the masses of water poured down is definitely concentrated in the
middle of the valleys. Waterfalls and lakes, wherever they occur, are only possible
as long as the erosion has not yet reached a certain maximum. In the Himalaya and
Tibet both are wanting. Lakes have been emptied by the constantly progressive
erosion, as is evidenced by numerous beds of lakes now dry ; in many cases the evapo-
ration has so greatly increased, after so many watery surfaces ceased to exist, that the
lakes still remaining begin to grow saline.

   Waterfalls have also formerly existed, but the lateral valleys have now become so
nearly equal in level, in their lower parts, with the principal valleys, in which the
erosion progresses more slowly in proportion in consequence of their smaller inclina-

tion, that the subsidiary rivers unite with the principal streams with scarcely an

acceleration of the current.

   This gradual production of valleys, of which the bed has become some thousands of
feet deeper, must naturally have had the greatest influence upon the physical con-

ditions.

  We should dread extending our remarks too far, if we did more than indicate the

essential consequences of erosion, to which we may perhaps hereafter have the oppor-

--tunity of adverting again ; and we here mention in conclusion, only, elevation of

temperature ; thermic action of the currents of air ascending the valleys along their
steep walls ; alternation of the conditions of moisture, and the changes, so intimately

ponnected with these, in the distribution of plants ; and extension of the glaciers,

   This communication contained an account of some of the general conclusions the
autlior had arrived at since the j)ublication of his papers on the subject. The micro-
scopical mineral structure of much so-called c/«^-s]ates, is entirely different from the
modern deposits of clay, formed from decomposed felspar, or from those occurring in

 strata that have undergone no subsequent chemical change. In fact they contain

--little or no clay, according to the usual acceptation of the term no felspar clay, but

are often almost entirely composed of very minute plates and crystals of a peculiar
mica, so that they might be called luica clay-slates. Though differing materially in

 several particulars, they are thus analogous to very fine-grained mica-schists, into

which they gradually pass by the increase in the size of tiie crystals of mica. The
form of many of the particles of which they are composed, and the manner in which
they are arranged, are quite different from what are seen in rocks that have been
merely deposited from suspension as mud, but are extremely like what occur when
minute crystals are formed in s'ltti. When not altered by subsequent mechanical
movements, the structure most closely resembles that of pseudomorphs of mica or

chlorite after felspar. If then it be supposed that the material had been at first depo-

sited as a decomposed felspar clay, and that a subsequent alteration occurred, so as to

convert it into a mass of minute crystals of mica, the physical structure could easily

be explained ; and it would not be requisite to suppose that the deposit was originally
in any way different from the ordinary clays of more modern periods. That this
change is physically possible is proved by the occurrence of large crystiils of felspar,
entirely replaced by mica and quartz ; and that the chemical composition of a deposit
of partially decomposed felspar is the same as that of a mixture of mica and quartz,

may be readily seen by comparing their composition. This may very clearly be shown
by employing the very simple formula for felspar, mica, and clay adopted by Gmelin
in his ' Handbook of Chemistry ' (Cavendish Soc. translation, vol. iii. pp. 415, 441

and 449).                                                                                                           = =2 equivalents of clay

The presence of the oxides of iron and other bases in the clay would, of course, mate-                                                                                          I
rially modify these results ; and when sufficient magnesia was present, it probably

determined the formation of chloritic or steatitic slate.
   The author therefore thinks that such clay-slate as is almost entirely composed of

mica was originally a deposit of ordinary felspar clay, and that, probably under the
action of water at a high temperature, this was altered into a mass of minute crystals of
mica. The quartz appears to have either remained disseminated amongst the mica,
or to have been removed and deposited in other situations ; for quartz veins are of very
general occurrence where this change has occurred, but are usually absent from those
strata where the felspar-clay remains in its original condition. This view of the sub-
iect is of much interest in connexion with slaty cleavage, since it explains why the
minute particles of mica were arranged so very promiscuously in all directions before
the cleavage was developed by pressure ; a fact which presented great difficulty, when

it was supposed that they had been simply deposited as mud from suspension in

   The author then proceeded to point out that there are two distinct extreme kinds
of structure that have often been confounded under the term slaty cleavage. One of
these characteristic of the best roofing-slates of Wales, is an ultimate stmctural
weakness, quite independent of any actual fractures or breaks of continuity, and may
thus be called uUimate-slructure-c\ea\agt. Experiments clearly prove that this is

just such a structure as would result from the rock yielding to pressure as a plastic

substance ; and the amount of absolute compression when the cleavage was developed,

as deduced from the form of the green spots, indicates that the amount of water

squeezed out was almost exactly the same as is requisite to render clay quite plastic.

The other extreme structure is a cleavage due to very close joints, often so close as to

be quite undistinguishable unless a thin section is examined with the microscope,

whilst the arrangement of the particles in the spaces between them is independent of

the direction of the joints, and is often related to quite another plane. This kind of

cleavage may therefore be called c/o,se-_;om/«-cleavage ; and agrees with what experi-

ment shows would have been the result if the rock had yielded to change of dimen-

sions like a rigid body, by the formation of close cracks. 'J'hese two kinds of cleavage

obey materially different laws; but at the same time, in like manner as there is a

gradual passage from rigidity to plasticity, so there is also between these two kinds of

structure, due to the rocks yielding in one way or the other according to the circuni-

stances of the case ; and thus the structure affords an indication of the actual condi-
tion of the rocks at the time when they were compressed; and perhaps also, in some

cases, indicates whether the movements of elevation were sudden or gradual.

The paper concluded with a list of the various physical structures the author had

Amet witli in stratified rocks.  difference in the kind of chemical change that has

occurred, and the previous or subsequent action of mechanical compression, when the

rocks were in a condition to yield as plastic, flexible, or rigid bodies, have produced

many more distinctly different structures than has been usually supposed.

On a Fossil of the Severn Drift. By the Rev. W. S. Symonds.

HamThe excavations of the alluvial drift of the Severn at Tewkesbury       are nearly

40 feet deep, and the river-bed itself has been dredged to the depth of 7 feet. The

river-bed contains osseous relics of the human race several feet below the surface of

the gravel; these are associated with the remains of Roman pottery, the vertebra of

a whale, and many singular round-shaped glass bottles of great thickness. The allu-

vial drift is a mass of clay and brick earth, 39 feet thick, resting upon an ancient

river-bed of gravel and shingle, and about 37i feet from the surface we find the fos-

silized antler of a large stag (Cervus). This antler is at the base of the brick earth,

a few feet above the gravel. I was interested in observing the difference in the state
of fossihzation between the vertebra of the whale, which is little altered, and the antler
of the deer, which is nearly stone. The antler is in much the same state as those
mammalian remains discovered by Mr. Strickland in the drifts of Avon Valley; while

we may compare the vertebra of the whale with the large crooked-horned head of a
Bison, obtained by Mr. Strickland, sen., from the Avon river-bed. From comparison
of the fossils, I am inclined to believe that the cervine antler of the Severn is the
relic of an animal that lived in the period of the Bos primigenius, a fine skull of

which is in Mr. Strickland's possession.

On a Neto Species of Eun/pferus from the Old Red Sandstone of Hereford-
                     shire. By the Rev. W. S. Symonds,

   This fossil was discovered by the parish clerk of Rowlstone, Herefordshire, and pre-

sented to the Rev. W. Wenraan. Mr. Symonds examined the correlation of the rocks

in which this fossil was found, and stated that they were grey sandstones of the upper
Cornstones, and pass upwards into those red and chocolate-coloured sandstones which
are surmounted by the " Old Red conglomerate." The Eurypterus is a Silurian fossil
of the Lower Tilestones, found by Mr. Banks associated with Pterygotus, Pteraspis,
and Himantopterus at Kington, and again in the Upper Tilestones of Kidderminster,
by Mr. Roberts, with Cophalaspis Lyelli, Parka decipiens, and Pteraspis truncatiis.
" Eurypterus pygmtBus" is found with the Lingula cornea, but the large form of that
crustacean, now about to be described by Mr. Salter, is a different and entirely new

species.

                 On the Geology of the Galty Mountains, S^e.
                   By A. B. Wynne, Geological Survey.

The author presented a north and south section across the summit of Galty More
--94 REPORT 1857.

from an outlier of the coal-measures on the south, through the carboniferous lime-
stone, Old llt'd Sandstone, and Sikn-ian, to the limestone of the Glen of Aherlow on

the north. This section may be regarded as typical of the geological structure of the
lofty range of the Galty Mountains, among the highest in the south of Ireland, reach-
ing an elevation of 3014 feet above the sea. The Lower Silurian, occupying chiefly
a large hollow in the centre of the range, surrounded by hills of varying height, cap-
ped with the lower conglomerate of the Old Red Sandstone, is composed of dark-
coloured green, olive, red, and pnrple slates, grits and gritty sandstones generally
Striking in a nearly east and west direction, dipping at high angles, sometimes to the
north, sometimes to tlie south, and often much contorted. Upon and unconformable
to it rests the Old Red Sandstone, which, from previously existing irregularities in the

surface of the Silurian, or from other causes, seems to have been very unequally depo-
sited, as seen by referring to the section, where this formation is represented on the

north by somewhat less than half its thickness to the south. It frequently presents fine
examples of oblique lamination ; and the only traces of organic life met with in it were
some small markings of two kinds, probably annelid tracks, or fucoids, in beds of fine
 red sandstone, near the base of the formation, specimens of which were exhibited.
The basal bed of the Old Red Sandstone is generally a thick soft conglomerate formed
 of red grit, pebbles, and fragments of the Silurian rocks in a purple paste, with very few
 pebbles of quart?. This character is not, however, constant, for it is sometimes found
 to be a green breccia with some rounded fragments of purple grit, and sometimes a
 few beds of red sandstone intervene between the conglomerate and the Silurian.
 Further up in the formation, at about half its thickness, occurs another marked band
 of conglomerate, the space between it and the basal one being occupied by red grits
 and sandstones. It is in one place 400 feet thick, and its pebbles are chiefly of quartz
 in a purple paste. Small and much rounded pebbles of syenite and trap are also fonnd
 in it, as well as some fragments of green and grey grit. Above this are more red
 grits, becoming paler as they approach the top, and having bands of liver-coloured
 shale, interstratified with yellowish and coai'se grey and greenish sandstone. At about
 1200 feet above the last-mentioned conglomerate occur certain beds of purple ferru-
 ginous .sandstone, having, when weathered, a pitted appearance. Immediately above
 them the author draws the very arbitrary boundary of the yellow sandstone, which,
 on the southern slopes of the Galties, may be about 1200 feet thick. There are just
 traces of some dark green gritty shales appearing in one or two places, which are pro-
 bably the representatives of the carboniferous slate. The apparent thickness of all the
 Old Red, including the Yellow, Sandstone on the south side of the mountains may
 be in different places from 4000 to 4500 feet, while on the north side it is only 2000
 feet thick. The carboniferous limestone is almost quite concealed by drift, and when
 seen is grey, compact, and sometimes slightly crystalline, containing corals and other
 fossils, but the Calp division does not appear. Upon it lies a thin outlier of the coal-
 measures, seen at the south end of the section, consisting of the lower black carbona-
 ceous shales and thin olive grits, in which a shaft was sunk with the hope of finding
 culm ; but the limestone was reached without success, and the search was then aban-

  doned.

                   County of Tipperary. By A. B. Wynne.

   This clay is found under and about the ruins of the old castle of Ballymacadam,
of which little more than the foundations now remain. The mode of its occurrence
is very strange, for when standing in the centre of the small hollow which it occu-

pies, at a distance of about 100 yards, on almost every side the carboniferous lime-

stone may be seen to protrude through the ordinary drift which is spread over the
surrounding country, and which most probably once covered this isolated basin of
tertiarv clay, occupying an area of at the most about an acre and a half. Many
pits have been sunk within this limit, of which three or four are visible, now filled

with water ; one small one has been recently opened to the depth of four or five feet,
and in this, in situ, was found a lenticular mass of lignite, a specimen of which is on
the table. The clay is usually white, more or less pure, and sometimes of a dun or
bluish tinge, smooth to the touch, and extremely tenacious. The lignite is brown.

and occurs in different states of decomposition and alteration, but iione of it remains
sufficiently perfect to prove what kind of wood it was. The potter's clay is not in

the lowest position in the neighbourhood, but at a slight elevation ; and close to it,

indeed, within the space it occupies, occur some of those natural drains so common

to the mountain limestone of Ireland, expressively called by the peasantry " swallow
in holes ;" these carrj' off all the surplus water which accumulates in the pits, one in
particular having been used to drain them whenever they "were opened. Having sunk
through about fifteen feet of white clay, containing small fragments of plants which
unfit it for the manufacture of pipes, a bed of lignite is reached, of varying thick-
ness, from which parts of trees four or five feet in length could be raised without

difficulty. Beneath this occurs the purest and best clay, which is white, with some-
times a pale shade of blue, is soft, and has a soapy feel. Lower than it no person
has penetrated, one of the reasons assigned being that thej' were prevented by springs
of clear water, then bursting upwards through the clay and filling the pits, accom-

panied by so ofi"ensive an odour of sulphuretted hydrogen as could scarcely be endured.

Even now the place is not quite free from a mitigated form of this unpleasant cir-

  umstance, which, as stated by Dr. Griffith, attends the occurrence of potter's clay

and lignite in many other places in Ireland, such as at the south-eastern margin of
Lough Neagh, counties of Tyrone and Antrim ; in the parish of Clonoe, in county
Tyrone ; and near Lough Ree, in Roscommon. Of the lowest found clay, which
burns white, have been manufactured very good tobacco pipes, and many articles of
finer ware, as cups and saucers, &c. ; while that above the lignite makes beautiful
buff and dun-coloured tiles; the most inferior of it has been used for bricks. The

lignite has been often used as fuel, but it gives forth a heavy and peculiar smell while
burning, and is associated with black shales, traces of which were seen near the

mouth of one of the pits. No shells were met with in any part of this clay.

   Mr. James Yates exhibited a fossil cone, the propertyof Mr. T. Wetherell, F.G.S.,
probably from the greensand formation. He explained the appearances which prove
that it belonged to the proper Coniferse, illustrating his statement by producing spe-

cimens of recent cones belonging to the Cycadeae.

   The President exhibited another fossil from the lower Oolite, in the south of
England, which, in the opinion of Mr. Yates, belonged to the Cycadese. This was
not a cone, but a stem.

           On the Lotus or Sacred Bean of India. By Dr. Buist.

                      {Communicated 1)1/ Dr. Norton Shaw.)

   This plant belongs to the natural order Nelumbiacefe, and is allied to the water
lilies, and is the Nelumhium speciosnni of botanists. Dr. Buist states that there are
three species of this genus at least. The only variety he had observed in India was
one with pale rose-coloured flowers, which when full-blown, but not open, formed
a globe of from 6 to 7 inches in diameter. The leaf is from 14 to 16 inches long, the
leaf and flowerstalks together from G to 8 feet in length. The leaf and flowerstalks
abound in spiral vessels, which Dr. Wright says are extracted and burnt by the Hindus
in the lamps placed before the shrines of their gods. Dr. Buist, however, states his
conviction that the spirals of all the lotuses of India, from the Himalayas to the
Line, would not malce a lamp- wick a yard long the thickness of the finger. The
stalks are full of air, the leaves buoyant and floating, and the flowers small, like
the Tonquin bean. After describing the external appearance and uses of the plant,
the author proceeded to describe

  --1. The infernal slructure of the root, floioer, and leaf-stems. The stalks are filled

with air, and in their construction care is taken to prevent the percolation or intro-

--duction of water.
   2. Repulsion of water from the leaves. This depends upon the surface of the
leaves being covered with a fine fur of silvery hair, like papillae, which, when mag-
nified, show themselves in the form of a succession of beads, diminishing in size
towards the ape,x. It is this structure which entangles and retains the air, and thus
obtains a high degree of buoyancy. It is the same structure which enables the rose,
clover, and young cabbage-leaves, young shoots of grain and grass to exhibit the
pearly forms of dew-drops, and to repel water from their surface. An analogous
structure performs the same function in the wings of diving birds.

  --3. Respiration of the Lotus. The lotus leaves constantly give out air from their

surface, which Dr. Buist has not examined. He found that one plant gave out from
a cut stem thirty-three cubic inches of air in an hour. The greatest quantity of this
air was given off two hours after sunrise.

strong and upright character of the stem, made Mr. J. Hogg rather suppose that it
might be a foreign species of Astragalus, which had been introduced with ballast.
At any rate, it must be considered as a plant very distinct from the usual form of
the pretty little A. hypoglottis.

    The second plant presents an extraordinary transformation of the flowering spike
or head of Plantago major.

    Each single flower in the spike assumed a close pyramidal bunch of flowers, and
the entire panicle also became a compact pyramid. This variety or abnormal form

--might be characterized as var. pyramidalis, paniculis pyramidalibus densis. Smith,

in his 'English Flora,' mentions a var. " Plantago rosea," but with which this trans-
formed plant does not seem to agree. The rest of the plant does not differ from the
usual form of P. major. It was discovered in a meadow, this summer, at Norton,

-- --in the county of Durham. And the third the Arhutxis Unedo is a plant of much

interest to the English botanist, for it grows naturally in the south-west of Ireland.
    Mr. Hogg, having just visited the Lakes of Killarney, showed two specimens

which he brought from thence, and which vary very greatly in their leaves ; one
having narrow leaves, a var. which he termed angustifolia ; and another with broad
 leaves, having some of them rounded at their tips, he designated as var. latifolia.

This second variety, which appeared to grow to a larger-sized and more robust tree,
he discovered on the margin of the Tore Lake, or as it is also called, the Middle
Lake, whilst the narrow-leaved form he gathered on the side of the Lower Lake : both
shores in those spots are of the same formation, viz. a compact limestone. Doctors
Mackay and Steele make no mention of these variations of the leaves of the straw-
berry tree in their respective floras of Ireland.

    Contributions to Vegetable Teratology. By T. Maxwell Masters.

On the forms of Diatomacecc found in Chalk. By the Rev. E. O'Meara.

The four specimens of chalk on which my experiments were made were taken

from the cliffs in the County of Antrim ; and having been well washed for the pur-

pose of removing such forms as might be attached to the surface, were dissolved in

hydrochloric acid, and when thus disintegrated were boiled in dilute sulphuric acid.

In all the preparations diatomaceous forms were found, a few of which I was un-

able to identify with any of those figured by Mr. Smith in his ' Monograph of the

British Diatomacese ;' but all the rest, forty-two in number, were identical with those

described by him as existing species.

They may be distributed into the three following classes :

       Species inhabiting fresh or brackish water               4

       Marine species                                           7

       Freshwater species                                       31

                                                                                                      Total 42

   It may be necessary to add, that the specimens selected were perfectly clean and
free from any coating of vegetable matter, and that the one which yielded the greatest
number of forms and of species had been repeatedly washed with hydrochloric acid,
and the disintegrated portion removed previous to treating the remainder, which was

subjected to examination.

Observations on the Plants tvhich, by their Growth and Decomposition, form

         the principal part of the Irish Turf-Bogs. By D. Moore.

   It was observed that, although much has been written on this subject, and many

able reports made on it, strange to say, no one had yet given any intelligible account

of the species of plants which enter principally into the formation of the turf-bogs of

Ireland, although so large a portion of the surface of the country is covered with them,

and bog labour constitutes no inconsiderable item of productive economy in Ireland.

The varieties of bog were divided into red bog, brown bog, black or turbary bog,

and mountain bog, which, although not very scientific, these being the names they

are best known by, are retained. The differences of colour and consistences of matter,

of which each variety is composed, were considered to depend chiefly on the localities

where the substances are produced, according as they vary in different degrees of

moisture, temperature, and altitude, whereby the growth and decomposition of vege-

tables are affected. Iron, and some other mineral substances which are generally

found in peat-bogs, had no doubt something to do with the colouring, but the former

combination of causes produced the effect principally.

By far the greatest portion of the bogs in Ireland consists of the kind called red

bog, which varies in depth from 10 to 40 feet, or even more. This variety is the

least valuable for fuel, owing to its soft fibrous consistency. It is supposed to have

been formed on the sites of extensive ancient lakes, or very wet morasses, which may

be inferred from the small quantity of wood found mixed up with it ; besides the

roots and trunks of trees being mostly found near the edges of the bog, the por-

tions towards the centre being composed of nearly a uniform mass of the debris of

the list of plants mentioned. Narthecium ossifragum, Eleocharis cmspitosa, Carex

atellulata, Schanus nigricans. Erica teiralix, and Myrica gale, might be considered

the phanerogamic plants which form the framework to bear up the mass of Sphag-

nums and other cryptogamic species which fill up the interstices on the higher and

drier spots, whilst Menyanihes trifoliaia, Comarum palustre, and Eriophorum angusti-

foliutn, mix their decumbeat and ruaning stems over the surface of water, which

soon become sufficiently matted together so as to be capable of bearing up the other
plants enumerated as forming this variety of bog. It was further stated, that although
Sphagnums constitute a large portion of this substance, without the aid of phanero-
gamic plants the formation of bog could not go on at nearly so quick a ratio as it does.

    In the absence of all trustworthy experiments on the growth of bog, the rate of
increase could not be well ascertained, but holes out of which turf had been cut had
been observed filled up with soft vegetable matter, to the depth of 1 foot in five years,
which, if supposed to be ultimately compressed into one-fourth part of that bulk,
after being solidified, as near an approach as can be made to the rate of increase of
bog at the present day might probably be reckoned on. In limestone districts, where
the larger species of Cliara abound, whose stems and branches are always thickly
encrusted with calcareous substances, the deposition of matter takes place faster than
it does where those plants are not so common. The debris resulting from Chara
hispida alone, where it grows freely, will soon fill up a shallow pool, so that plants
higher in the scale of vegetation can grow on it. According to the Report of the
Commissioners appointed to report on the nature and extent of the Irish bogs, up-
wards of a million of English acres are covered with red and brown bog, more than
two-third parts of which are westward of the river Shannon.

    The variety called black or turbary bog was next considered in detail, which is
the most valuable for fuel, owing to the great quantity of woody matter it contains.
This variety is supposed to have been formed on the sites of ancient forests, which
either spread continuously over large portions of the country, or skirted the margins
of morasses, as is evident from the large quantities of prostrate trunks of trees and
their roots, frequently in situ, which are found in it. The kinds consist chiefly of
Pinus sylvesiris, Querciis rohur, Betula alba, and Abms ylutinosa, though large quan-
tities of yew, Taxus baccaia, and some mountain ash, are also found in particular
districts. The roots of the oaks are generally nearest the margins of the bogs, resting
on the clay or marl bottoms ; whilst the Scotch firs occur further towards the centre,
and rest on several feet of peat, thus showing that a considerable accumulation of
that substance must have taken place before they vegetated on it. These roots are
frequently found one above the other, where they have grown, which has led some
to suppose there have been several consecutive and distinct epochs of growth, and
that some species of the trees which formed them are not now natives of Ireland.
This hypothesis was not considered correct, but rather, that by the gradual growth
of the bog, matter accumulated and covered the first tier of roots, and the seeds of
contiguous trees, on falling and vegetating above them, grew and formed in their turn
another tier, and so on up to the present surface, as a few of the trees of those
ancient forests which once covered so large a portion of Ireland still exist on the Earl
of Arran's property in the County Mayo at the present time.

    After the plants which form this variety of bog were enumerated, the kind called
mountain bog was next considered, which sometimes accumulates to a great depth
on the tops of mountains, at elevations varying from 1000 to 2000 feet. The Sphag-
nums do not enter so largely into the composition of this kind, but their place is
supplied by the grey moss, Racomitrium lanuginosum. The conclusions Mr. Moore
has come to on this subject are the following ; namely, that so far as proofs exist, the
same plants which are now forming the bogs of Ireland have done so from the bottom
upwards, though probably at different ratios, as drainage has increased, and that all

mthe species are still existence in Ireland which have ever formed any part of them.

These formations he considers to be of a more recent date than the glacial epochs of
geologists, with probably the exception of that at Lough Neagh, which may have been
anterior to that period ; but he thought it would be very hazardous to state the species
which formed the fossilized wood found there.

On the Importance of a thorough understanding of the Root Principle in the

   Cultivation of Trees. Hy N. Niven, Landscape Gardener and Garden

    Architect, ^c.

    Success in connexion with the cultivation of trees, but especial ly /ru«7- Searing trees,
is unquestionably of the utmost importance as far as matter-of-fact result goes in
the production of fruit, and therefore the desirableness of a thorough understanding
                               --

TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  99

of the principle in trees that chiefly conduces to the development of the same

namely, that of the root. When I thus distinctively allude to the " Root Principle,"

I hold that in all cases of the vegetable structure there are invariably two distinct

and separate processes going forward in the development of each separate tree or

--plant the one from the root upwards, which I, on a former occasion before the

British Association, some years ago, in Liverpool, denominated, in contrast with the

--above, " the I/eaf Principle," these being as it were the two extreme ends or

turning-points in the circle of assimilation, and continually more or less in action,

--according to the stimuli arising from light, air, heat, and moisture, the leaf being

--so far analogous to the lung in animals, and the spongiole or root to that of the

heart, the one, from the combined action of atmosphere, light and heat, conducing
to the deposition of woody fibre, or the annual layer of wood in the tree, and the
ramification of that wood into numerous roots and rootlets ; the other, from the

--action of soil and its various constituents, to the development of buds, leaves, flowers,

and fruit, this beautiful and simple process of circulation passing separately up and
down without intermixture, but evidently, I conceive, b)^ distinct sets of vessels,
through the alburnous layer between the bark and the wood, externally in Dicotyle-
dons, and internally as it relates to Monocotyledons. Nor do I consider that we can
ever actually change the course of these principles so as to invert their results. Cut
the tree by a mortise section, as shown by the figure in Lindley's ' Theory of Horti-
culture,' p. 36, or rather look at the figure on p. 35, and you will see an exact
representation of the embryo development of the leaf and. root principles alluded to,

as they became developed in the course of my experiments quoted. In short, the

--leaf cannot long exist without the root, nor the root without the leaf; the one and

the other are evidently equally essential to vegetable life. I stop not, however, to

dwell upon the multitudinous variations and modifications of the two principles in

question to be met with amongst the various genera and species of plants (as^ for
instance, the Cacti and other succulents), as what I above describe may be sufficient

for my present purpose. To the point, then. In the management of fruit-bearing
trees, whilst much doubtless will depend upon the nature and quality of soil, situa-
tion, aspect, &c., as it regards the growing process, much more as io fruit bearing

will depend upon the manipulation, position, form and nature of the roots. I doubt

--not the growing specimens presented will readily illustrate this, the roots being com-

pletely washed clear of the soil, so as to facilitate examination. In these two fruit-
bearing dwarf trees with the numerous roots, I present specimens planted only six
months since ; in tho other two specimens you have the same varieties ; but on another
form of roots, barren, and likely so to be for three or four years to come. It may
now be said, how is all this ? I will shortly endeavour to tell you. la the fruit-
bearing Pear, the stock worked upon is the Quince, a close congener of the genus

Pyrus, namely, Cydonia vulgaris, remarkable for the minute subdivision and conse-
quent number of its rootlets, forming, as may be observed, a perfect wig. The other,
but barren tree, is of the same kind and date of grafting, but worked upon the

-- --common Pear stock or Pear grown from the seed pip in other words, the Crab

Pear, the roots of which are few, deep, and straggling. In the case of the fruit-
bearing apple, the stock worked upon is what is called the Paradise; that is, the cut-

ting from a certain kind of grafted apple that is highly productive of roots and root-
lets, as in the case of the Quince above noticed. The other, but barren Apple, is also

of the same kind and date as that just mentioned, but worked on the common or Crab
stock, raised in like manner from the seed or pip, and, with the barren Pear, nearly
equally deficient in fibres. The cause of this remarkable contrast of precocity on the

one hand, and barrenness on the other, arises chiefly from the forms and positions of
their roots. In those with fruit, the numerous spongioles or feeders of these twiggy
rootlets at once answer the question as to precocit}', as tending, from the immediate
action of air, heat and moisture, to the rapid maturation of the ripening process and

consequent development of flower-buds. On the other hand, as it regards the barren
specimens presented, you at once see how different are the forms and distribution of

the roots : in these they are more in the form of tap-roots running deep into the soil
and subsoil, and away from the more direct influence of solar heat and air, thus
lessening greatly the ripening process in the wood so conducive to flower-bud forma-
tion, and thereby otherwise going to the productiou of strong long-jointed water-

                                                                                  7*

shoots. In many cases of deep cold soils, such trees might not bear for several years

after planting.

   To meet any ordinary contingency of drought, when the roots are thus kept near

the surface, as in the case of the fruit-bearing specimens before you, it is necessary
to counteract this by a simple application of surface mulching. This is one of the
most essential items of treatment in the cultivation of almost all fruit trees, but

--especially exotic species as the peach, nectarine, &c. Next in importance is the

matter of periodical root-pruning as it is called. The most easy and effectual way
in which I accomplish this is, say every second or third year, to lift the tree fairly up
out of the ground and either put it back again in its old place, or, what is better,

--change the position somewhat. This, with a little fresh food, will do the work

effectually ; and the result lots of fine plump fruit. In short, the more such wig-
rooted trees are thus handled and moved about, the more will their fruit-bearing

tendencies increase.
    I have thus endeavoured shortly to set forth the importance of a thorough under-

standing of the action of the root principle in fruit-bearing trees ; and I may con-
clude by adding that the same process applies equally to wall as to standard trees.

   Ok the Remarkable Result of an Experiment upo7i a Fruit-bearing Tree.
       By N. NiVEN, Landscape Gardener and Garden Architect, ^c.

    In the book of the Revelation of St. John, it will be remembered that in the con-
cluding chapter of that sublime portion of the sacred volume, a very wonderful tree
is there described, prophetically, as bearing " twelve manner of fruits, and yielding
her fruit every month." Struck with this description, the author was led to consider
what possible approximation could be made towards such a result, with the means
placed, under the present order of things, at his disposal. From amongst our hardy
fruit-bearing trees he made choice of the Pear, fixing upon a highly vigorous and
healthy young specimen then in the course of ordinary training, that had been pre-
viously worked or grafted, and which had arrived at fruit-bearing. This tree occu-
pies a portion of the walls of his residence, having been planted on an angle of the
building, occupying thereon two aspects, the one east, the other south or nearly
so, the leading stem or trunk being on the angle, the side branches being horizontal,
thus as it were at this point clasping the two walls of the house. The object aimed
at, it will now he seen, was, if possible, to endeavour to construct a tree that would
yield a succession of fruits for each month of the year complete. In the specimen
fixed upon there were twenty horizontal branches on each side, thus presenting facility
for the insertion by grafting oi forty varieties or kinds of Pears. Accordingly the fol-
lowing selection and classification of sorts were made, put on, and labelled, viz. :

          Months.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  tOl

   In the spring of 1855, the scions of these various varieties were inserted one upon
each branch, all of which had been cut back to within six inches of the main stem.

--Thus the important process of what is called doitble grafting, or grafting tipon a graft,

was effected, a process greatly tending to extra fruitfulness In the tree. Almost each
graft of the above succeeded ; and the growth of the whole came off simultaneously,
and with nearly equal luxuriance, the same healthful progress resulting in 1856, but
with the interesting addition of numerous sets of flower-buds on many of the
grafts. In the spring of the present year the blossoms set freely, and now there
are upwards of one hundred fine specimens of fruit upon so many of the sorts, that
they will, in the order of their ripening, nearly, if not fully, realize the result hoped

for.

   Thus, in July, we had Citron des Carmes ; in August, Belle d'Aousti ; in Septem-
ber, we shall have Beurre d'Amanlis ; in October, Flemish Beauty ; in November,
Napoleon j in December, Glout Morceau ; in January, Beurre Langeher ; in Febru-
ary, Winter Beurre ; in March, Easter Beurre ; in April, Late Bergamot ; in May,

Beurre Ranee ; in June, Suzzette de Bavey.
   These, therefore, may fairly be looked upon as the types of the monthly classes

as they will come to maturity for the table ; and thus by having so many duplicates,
as to their times of coming into season, under ordinary circumstances, we may rea-
sonably expect that the circle of monthly supply from the one tree will be completed

year by year. The value and importance of the above curious result, particularly

where wall accommodation is limited, will at once appear ; but besides this, the
opportunity that will be presented for comparison between one variety and the other,
and the ready ascertainment of their respective qualities and characters, must greatly

tend to the enjoyment and pleasure, as well as profit, of the interested cultivator.

thought must be referred to the Coniferse. He also exhibited a specimen of the

stem of a fossil Cycad, which bore a close resemblance to the recent Cycadaceae.

On the Sea Fisheries of Ireland, with reference to their investigation practi-
              cally and scientifically. By William Andrews.

   This paper was chiefly directed to pointing out the want of knowledge that had
hitherto existed in carrying out all projects connected with the fisheries of the coasts
of Ireland ; hence the repeated failures of Companies formed for those objects.

    Habits and seasons of the fish frequenting the coasts, periods of spawning, and
characteristics of spawn and spawning grounds, peculiarity of the soundings and
marine animals, were branches of knowledge of essential importance, and these were
treated of scientifically and practically in the paper. In the many investigations
that had been held with regard to the regulations of trawling, much ignorance had
been shown by fishermen (who had opposed the working of the trawl boats) in
their knowledge of the nature of the spawn of the several kinds of fish which were
trawled for, and this was proved in an inquiry made at Galway in 1852, where Mr,
Andrews had shown that masses of a substance, which the fishermen had averred to
be the spawn of fish, was nothing more than a species of sponge, the Cliona Celata
of Johnston, and which frequently occurred in clear ground in Galway Bay in fifteen
to twenty fathoms.

recorded as Irish, whilst 803 are found io Great Britain. I have paid some atten-
tion to this order of insects during the present summer, and have much pleasure in
exhibiting specimens of twenty-five species captured in Ireland, and not included in

--Mr. Green's list. They may be thus summed up : two Papilionidse ; one Sphinx

five Bombyces; seven' Noctuse ; five Py rales ; five Geometree. There can be no
doubt that the great discrepancy which still exists between the British and Irish lists
of Lepidoptera would be much further reduced, even if a few districts of Ireland were
fully worked by resident collectors : to collect successfully, local knowledge is essen-
tial, and the hurried visit of a stranger to any district generally results in disappoint-
ment. The West of Ireland, in particular, where many districts remain to the pre-
sent time in much the same state as they have been for centuries, presents a wide
 field for research, and affords strongholds to species of great interest to the naturalist,
probably to some altogether new. I may mention that ten of the species now exhi-
 bited were captured in the county of Galway. The recent discovery of Anthrocera
Minos in the locality referred to is an earnest of what we may expect when the West
 of Ireland is thoroughly explored : this conspicuous insect occurs in great profusion,
 yet shows no disposition to wander beyond an extremely restricted locality, where
 it has doubtless flourished for ages. The following is a list of the new species :

 Note on Peculiarities of Growth in Cacidce. By Philip P. Carpenter.

    The Cfficidae are a group of rostriferous Gasteropoda, with shells shaped likeX)e«-
 talium, and closed by a plug at the posterior end. There are many successive stages
 of growth, varying in shape and structure, but constant in the form of plug, which
 is of complex structure, displaying lines of growth from a central or lateral nucleus,
 and affords one of the best guides for the discrimination of species. As a mono-
 graph of the family was in preparation, the author sought opportunities of exa-
 mining specimens from those who were interested in microscopical inquiries. They
 were abundant in the sponge of commerce, and lived in the worm-eaten passages of

 decaying shells.

  On the Embryo State o/'Palinurus vulgaris. By R. Q. Couch, Penzance.

     At the time of the publication of Professor Bell's admirable work on British
 Crustacea, by some inadvertence the particulars respecting the embryo condition of
 Palinurv.s vulgaris were overlooked, and up to the present time have not been pub-
 lished. As several years have now passed, and the subject has not hitherto attracted
 the attention of any other observer, I beg to lay the following observations before
 the meeting. The metamorphoses of the decapod crustaceans may now be considered
 as established by observation made in every part of the world. The first announce-
 ment of the discovery came from Ireland, from experiments made near Cork by the
 late Mr. J. V. Thompson. The form under which the young decapods first appeared
 was announced as belonging to the genus Zoea, and all subsequently published
observations have confirmed this. But in the species to which I now refer there is
 an important exception. Lest there should be any error on the matter, I have
during the past summer again investigated the point, and have bred many thousands

in confinement, and have under the microscope seen them escaping ex ovo ; so that

there can, in my own mind, be but little doubt on the matter. The young of Pali-
nurus vulgaris diflFers from every other species with which I am acquainted. On

escaping ex ovo the different parts are very obscure, from being so closely folded

together ; but in a few minutes they are sufficiently spread out to become recog-
nizable by a moderate magnifying power. The carapace is globularly oval, slightly
pointed or produced both at the anterior and posterior margin, and is slightly con-
tracted anteriorly so as to give the appearance of a rostrum. The abdomen is
moderately long, and from four of the six annulations of which it is formed arise
eight pairs of tendril-like appendages. The lateral margin of each ring is expanded
into a thin projecting process, from which the articulated appendages arise. These
tendrils are long, slender, and dichotomous. Their double character commences at
the third joint, and afterwards they are nearly of equal length, and both are covered
with strongly marked spines, termination pointed. The caudal extremity is simple,

contracted, pointed, and somewhat oval. On the centre of the rostrum is a dark

spot. The eyes are on enormously long and stoutly club-shaped peduncles, which
are attached by very narrow and slender points. The pedunculated eyes are about

two-thirds as long as the carapace. This concise description, with the figures

accompanying it, will sufficiently explain the great differences between this and the
young of all the other species hitherto described. So general is the Zoe form, that

it has even passed into an expression with investigators of this branch of Natural
History, and " the Zoe condition" has been considered equivalent to " the Embryo
state " in speaking of these creatures. The contrast between the present species
and that of others is very great. In them the eyes are sessile, in this enormously
pedunculated ; in them the feet are beneath the carapace, in this they are attached

to what, for clearness, I have called the abdominal rings. Instead, therefore, of
belonging to the genus Zoe, I would place it in Phyllosoma of Milne-Edwards,

belonging to the Stornapodes.

  On British Naked-eyed Medusce, with notices of seven undescribedforms.

                            By Joseph R. Greene.

   The author commenced by alluding to the progress which had been made in the
study of the Naked-eyed Medusae since the publication of ProfessorE. Forbes's mono-
graph; the researches of Agassiz, Leuckhardt, and Gegenbaur being more especially
dwelt on. He next gave a list of the Acalephae which he had hitherto observed on
the Dublin coast, in all amounting to twenty-five species. The Siphonophoraj were
re|)resented by the beautiful Agalmopsis of Sars ; the Ctenophorse by two species

--of Cydippe one of Beroe, and the Mneraia Norvegica ; the Steganophthalmata by

ail the British species, except Pelagia ; and the GjTnnophthalmata by thirteen
species, six of which were new to science. In addition to the above, two other

species of Thmimantias had been taken in Belfast Bay, one the T. lineata, the other
a new species, which he proposed to name T. Patfersonii.

   The author then proceeded to describe the seven new species which he had dis-

covered. Three of these were referred to the genus Thaumantias, one to Bougain-
villea, one to Equorea, one to Steenstrupia, and one was deemed sufficiently remark-
able to induce him to establish a new genus for its reception. This last animal was
particularly interesting, since it was, in all probability, identical with the medusoids
produced from Coryne, as observed in Iceland by Professor Steenstrup.

   The author also noticed that in this medusa reproduction took place by gemma-
tion from the tentacles themselves, as also from the tentacular bulbs. He had
observed the latter mode to occur in his new species of Steenstrupia. The develop-
ment of medusoids from Laomedea geniculata was next alluded to : in all the cases
which the author had himself observed, the medusoids were free and detached, nor
in any instance was he able to corroborate the statement of Loven, " that the medu-
soids merely expanded at the summit of the ' ovigerous vesicle,' discharged ova,
and then perished." He did not, however, wish to deny the correctness of Loven's
description. The free medusoids were probably males. Allusion was also made to
the observations of Dr. T. S. Wright and Mr. C. W. Peach. The author concluded
by calling the attention of members to the study of this interesting group of animals.

        Notice of a curious Monstrosity of Form in the Fusus antiquus.

                              By G. C. Hyndman.

   The specimen exhibited was obtained during the present summer, by dredging oflf
Groomsport, in the county Down, by Samuel Vance, Esq., and George Murray, Esq.,
and kindly presented by the former to Mr. Hyndman. Unfortunately, the animal
was not preserved, as the specimen was boiled along with a number of other shells,

and their contents extracted before the singular form of this shell attracted notice.
The author had no doubt, however, in referring to it as a curious and interesting

monstrosity of the common Fusus antiqmw, although its convolute form more nearly
resembled that of the foreign genus Delphinula, or of Euomphalus. From the pro-
jection of two or three turns of the original apex of the shell, from the centre of the
coil, the author considered that the abnormal form had been occasioned by some
accident befalling the animal whilst in the young state, which obliged it to change

the usual angle of the whorl with the central spire, and that the shell has thus

become convoluted as seen.

Remarks on certain Genera of Terrestrial Isopoda.

             By Professor J. R. Kinahan.

These have all been included by M. Edwards under his group Cleportides, but are

very improperly characterized, and the British species are comparatively unknown.

A new arrangement of the genera was proposed, the characters selected as generic
being the presence or absence of the so-called "epimerals" of the abdominal rings,

the state of development of the frontal and lateral lobes of the head, the form and
characters of the terminal abdominal ring and its appendages, and the form and

structure of the filaments of the external antennce. The following arrangement

was suggested :--Family Ligidae, genus Ligia (Brandt) ; family Philocidse, genera

Ligidium, Titanethes (Schiodte), Philoscia (Latreille) ; family Iteadae, genera Tri-

choniscus (Brandt)? this genus may owe its origin to imperfect means of examina-

tion. Itea (Koch, in part) ;--this would appear to contain three genera in Koch, one

only of which belongs to this division. Philougria (raihi), Deto (Guerin)? Porcel-

lioiiida;, Platyarthrus (Brandt)? Porcellio (Brandt) ; Oniscus (Latreille); Armadil-
lidse. Armadillo (Brandt); Armadillium (Brandt); Spheriilo (Dana). The other
families, Cubaridffi and Diploexochids, are not met with in Britain. ITie species met

with in Britain are as follows : seven being new to that country ; they are all met

with in Ireland, except P. armadilloides, of which specimens from London are in the

--British Museum collection : Ligia oceanica ; Philoscia muscoruni ; Philougria celer

(raihi) ; Philougria, generic character, epimerals of abdominal rings rudimentary,
head rounded, neither lateral nor frontal lobes, last pair of abdominal false legs

uncovered, peduncle branched, external branch of the lateral appendages subulate ;

antennae four ; internal antennae rudimentary ; external antennae filament subulate,

smooth, five-jointed, terminal joint setaceous : Porcellio scaler (Brandt) ; P. dilu'

talus (Brandt) ; P. pictus (Brandt) ; P. lavis (Latreille) ; P. pruinosus (Brandt)

--P. armadilloides (Lereboullet) ; P. civgendus (mihi), body elongated, smooth or

slightly scabrous,  frontal  and  lateral processes  rudimentary  only                     last  abdominal
                                                                                        ;

ring triangular, acute at apex : Oniscus murarius (Cuv.) ; O.fossor (Koch ?) ; Arma-

dillium officinale (Brandt). All the species are from the neighbourhood of Dublin.

       On a Neio Species o/"Galathea. By Professor J. R. Kinahan.

   This species combined many of the characters of the genera Munida and Galathea
as at present constituted, possessing the elongate slender claws of the former, and
the flattened broad rostrum of the latter. This new species in characters is inter-
mediate between the three known species. Professor Kinahan had named it Gala-

thea Andrewsii. It is found abundantly along the east coast of Ireland, from Belfast

to Dublin.

        On the Spectre Distinctions of Uria troile and Uria lacrymans.

                                   Bt/ the Rev. F. O. Morris.

   The author showed that in the Uria lacrymans the eye is larger than in the Uria
troile, and this, in addition to the permanent white streak from which the bird derives
its name in the Latin, French and English languages, and the darker colour of old
birds, he considered to establish the species distinct. He pointed out the Corvus
eorone as only distinguishable from Corvus comix in a portion of the plumage ; and
though the birds were different in habits, so were the young and the old birds of one
and the same species, Larus marinus, the former being gregarious and the other not.
On the whole, he concluded that neither in the shape or size of the bill or feet was
there any but accidental or temporary differences between individuals of the two
species, as imagined by Macgillivray and others, but the distinctions he had pointed
out, existing as they did " semper, ubique, et in omnibus," were permanent specific
characteristics, and marked the individuality of the species.

On the Dispersion of Domestic Animals in connexion with the Primary Eth'
     nological Divisions of the Human Race. By W. Ogilby, F.L.S.

   The author commenced by observing that the present memoir was the complement
of a paper read at the Belfast Meeting of the Association, " On the Geographical Dis-

tribution of Animals adapted to Domestication, in relation to the progressive Develop-

ment of Human Civilization." The extent of the subject, and the limited time at

his disposal, compelled him to confine his attention to the domestic sheep ; but the
same phenomena were exhibited by the Ox, Dog, Goat, &c. The leading facts of Mr.
Ogilby's communication may be comprised under the following heads :

    1. That the Ovis Brachyiira, proper to the northern parts of Europe and Asia, is
the characteristic variety of the Tschudic or Ugrian races of mankind. The conquests
and encroachments of the Indo-Germanic races have circumscribed the boundaries,
and in some places interpolated their own proper variety (the 0. dolichura) into the

original habitat of the short-tailed  sheep                              but even where  the  aboriginal  natives
                                                                      ;

have been long extirpated or amalgamated with the conquering race, as in Iceland,

the Faroe Islands, &c., this variety still retains its ground; whilst it is the only

breed found north of the river Occa among the scattered remains of the Ugrian

nations.

   2. That the Ovis dolichura has been from time immemorial the appropriate breed
of the Indo-Germanic nations, the Celts, Germans, Greeks, Romans, &c. The con-

quests and migrations of this widely-spread race probably introduced it into Western
and Southern Europe long anterior to the historic era, as they have more recently

done into North-western India, America, Australia, and partially into Northern

Africa.

3. That the Ovis plaiynra was originally, as it still continues to be, the character-

istic variety of the Semitic nations. It is frequently mentioned in the Bible, and has
been extended by the conquests and commerce of the Arabs into Central Asia,
Persia, Barbary, and along the whole East coast of Africa, as far as the Cape of Good

Hope. It is this variety which furnishes the beautiful lamb-skins of Bokhara and

the Crimea.

4. That the Ovis steatopyga was the original breed of the Mongolic nations, who

still continue to cultivate it exclusively on the elevated plains of Central and North-
eastern Asia and China. At a very remote period it was introduced by the conquests
of these hordes into South-western Asia, and is unmistakeably mentioned by Moses
in three or four texts of the Sacred Volume ; but it seems never to have obtained
much favour among the Semitic nations, and was not spread abroad, like the 0. pla-

tyura, by the conquests of the Arabs.

   5. That the Ovis loiigicaudata was the original, as it still continues to be the ap-
propriate breed of the dark-skinned i-aces of mankind both in Asia and Africa, the

^Ethiopians of classical writers. It is exclusively found in the Central and Western
parts of Africa, from Mount Atlas to the country of the Great Damarras; and still
lingers along the Southern coasts of Arabia and Persia, in both Indian Peninsulas,
and the interior of some of the great islands of the Indian Archipelago.

Mr. R. Patterson read the following note of the quantity of periwinkles (Litto-

rina Uitorea) shipped at Belfast during the years 1 853, 1854, 1855, and 1856. It had

been kindly furnished to him by Edmund Getty, Esq., Secretary to the Harbour

Commissioners of that port :

Such of these as are not got in the Bay of Belfast, are principally collected on the
coasts of the County Down; but the " banks" from which they have been derived
are becoming exliausted, and no longer capable of supplying the demand. The
quantity of periwinkles deficient is now imported from Stranraer to Belfast, and

thence re-shipped for London. The local term in the north of Ireland for the peri-
winkle is " whelk." The " whelk" {Buccinum undatum) is known as the " buckle."

  On a Method of applying the Compound Microscope to the sides or top of
    Aquaria less than two feet in height. By Professor Redfern, M.D.

  The arrangement consists of a vertical stem, supported by a heavy foot. On the

stem a short transverse tube slides vertically and rotates on the axis of the stem, as
well as on an axis at right angles to the direction of the stem. This transverse tube
carries a long sliding arm, made use of as a lever, with arms of very unequal length.

AThe short arm of the lever terminates in the cup of a ball-and-socket joint. short

stem attaches a tube to the ball, and this tube allows that which carries the objective
and ocular to slide through it in coarse adjustment ; whilst a fine adjustment is made

by acting on the long arm of the lever. The body of the microscope may thus be

placed either vertically or horizontally, and placed either over an aquarium or applied
to its side with equal ease in the use of the 2 inch, 1-inch, and the g-inch objectives.
For the purpose of illumination, the author employs a small mirror, which is let

down into the fluid, and is capable of being moved in any direction by a simple
arrangement of brass wires shown to the Section.

            On Flustrella hispida. By Professor Reufern, M.D.

   The author pointed out numerous inaccuracies in the existing descriptions of
Flustrella hispida, under the names of Flustra hispida and Fhistra cai-nosa, referring
especially to the facts that no spines are ever to be found on that side of the aperture
of the cell next its base ; and that whilst in specimens gathered in Kincardineshire
the spines are placed on the septa all round the cells, in those gathered in Dublin
Bay the spines for the most part form a semicircle over the aperture, two or three
only being found on the sides of the cell in rare instances. The author then described
the structure of the polypide after its removal from the cell and its development by
gemmation, describing its various stages from day to day, as it grew from a mere
projection on the wall of the original cell, up to a complete cell with its spines and
fully protruded polypide. The various characters of the perfectly formed zoophyte,
with its cells set with spines, the most prominent features of its anatomical struc-
ture, and the growth of the new being from day to day, were illustrated by a series
of coloured drawings made by the author with the camera lucida. Microscopical
preparations were also exhibited to the Section showing the characters of the cell,
and of the polypide after its removal.

      Notes on some of the Animals of Tibet and India.

       By Hermann and Robert Schlagintweit.

The existence of the Yak, or Tibetan Ox {Bos grunniens), in a wild state has been

repeatedly doubted, but we frequently found wild yaks. The chief localities where

we met with them were both sides of the range which separates the Indus from the

Sutlej, near the origin of the Indus, and near the environs of Gartok                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         but the great-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

as to the south of the Kuenluen, in Turkistan. In Western Tibet, particularly in

Ladalf, there are no more yaks in a wild state at present, though [ have no doubt

that they have formerly existed there. They seem to have been extirpated here, the

population being, though very thin, a little more numerous than in Tibet in general.
As Ladak has been occasionally more visited by travellers than any other part of

Tibet, the want of the yak here has probably given rise to the idea that they are no

more to be found in a wild state at all. Amongst all quadruped animals the yak is

found at the greatest height : it stands best the cold of the Snowy Mountains, and

is least affected by the rarefied air. But at the same time the range of temperature

in which a yak can live is very limited ; the real yak can scarcely exist in summer

Wein heights of 8000 feet.    often found large herds of wild yaks, from thirty to

--fortj', in heights of 18,600 to 18,900 English feet; and on one occasion we traced

them even as high as 19,300 feet, a remarkable elevation, as it is very considerably

above the limits of vegetation, and even more than 1000 feet above the snow-line.

The hybrid between the yak and the Indian cow is called Chooboo, and it is very

remarkable that the chooboos are fertile. The chooboos, which are most useful

domestic animals to the inhabitants of the Himalayas, are brought down to lower

places, where yaks do not exist, and where consequently they cannot mix either

Wewith yaks or with the Indian cow.  had occasion to see and examine the offspring

of chooboos as far as to the seventh generation, and in all these cases we found the

later generations neither much altered nor deteriorated ; and we were moreover in-

formed that there was never found any limit as to the number of generations.

The Kiang, or wild horse {Equvs hemionus), has been often confounded with the

Gorkhar, or wild ass, though they differ considerably in appearance, and inhabit

countries with very dissimilar climates. The kiang exists in the high cold regions

and mountains of Tibet, the ass in the heated sandy plains of Sindh and Beloo-

chistan. The kiang is found in great numbers nearly in the same localities as the

yak ; he does not, however, go up the mountains so high as the yak, but the range

of his distribution is greater than that of the yak. The greatest elevation where we

found kiangs was 18,600 English feet, whilst we traced yaks as high up as 19,300

feet. The region where the yak and the kiang are found are, in a zoological

point of view, among the most remarkable and interesting of our globe. The

highest absolute elevation coincides here, it is true, with the greatest height of the

snow-line, or rather it causes the snow-line to be higher. But those large, high

plateaus and regions, though free from snow and ice in summer, remain a desert

throughout the year. The amount of vegetation on them is less than it is in the

Desert between Suez and Cairo, in Egypt. Nevertheless these high, sterile regions

are  inhabited  by  numerous  herds  of large quadrupeds                                                                                              and  besides those  already
                                                                                                                                                   ;

mentioned, numerous species of wild sheep, antelopes, and a few canine animals,

chiefly wolves, as well as hares, are abundant. The herbivorous animals find here

their food only by travelling daily over vast tracts of land, as there are only a few

fertile spots, the greater part being completely barren. The great scarcity of vege-

tation, particularly the entire absence of mosses and lichens, has a very different

effect, though an indirect one, on the occurrence of birds. Those small plants are the

chief abode of insects : the want of mosses and lichens, coinciding with a total absence
of humus, limits, therefore, to its minimum the occurrence of insects, the exclusive

food of small birds in all extremely elevated parts of the globe, where grains are no
Wemore found.
                    indeed met, travelling twenty consecutive days between heights of

14,000 to 18,200 feet, only with three individuals belonging to a species of Fringilla,

but occasionally a few large carnivorous birds, as vultures, were met with.

The Gorkhar, or wild ass {Asinus onager), an animal which, as I mentioned before,

has been often confounded with the Kiang, or wild horse, inhabits chiefly the rather

hilly districts of Beloochistan, part of the sandy plains of Sindh ; and a similar animal

is to be found, if I am not mistaken, to the westward of Beloochistan, in Persia,

which is called Koolan (Eqiius hemippus). Dr. Barth lately told me, that, according

to the description I gave him, he thinks the asses he saw in Africa identical with the

Gorkhars, or wild asses, of Sindh and Beloochistan.

I will now try to give an explanation about the fabulous Unicorn, or animal which

is said to have one horn only. This animal has been described by Messrs. Hue and

Gabet, the famous travellers in Eastern Tibet, according to information they received.
--108 REPORT 1857.

as a species of antelope with one horn placed unsymmetrically on his head. When my

brother Hermann was in Nepaul, he procured specimens of horns of a wild sheep
(not of an antelope) of very curious appearance. At first sight it seemed to be but
one horn placed on the centre of the head ; but on closer examination, and after
having made a horizontal section of the horn, it was found to consist of two distinct
parts, which were included in a horny envelope, not unlike to two fingers put in one
finger of a glove. The animal when young has two separate horns, which are how-

ever placed so close to each other, that the interior borders begin very soon to touch
each other ; later, by a slight consequent irritation, the horny matter forms one un-
interrupted mass, and the two horns are surrounded by this horny substance, so that
they appear at first sight to be but one.

   In conclusion, allow me to say a few words about migratory birds. There are no
migratory birds in the Himalayas ; we nowhere and at no season found flocks cross-
ing the Himalayas, as many birds of Europe cross the Alps, between Italy and Ger-
many. The Himalayan birds do not change their abodes on a large scale ; the
dififerent various heights themselves aflford them the opportunity to select the climate

they require in different seasons. In the plains of India, however, chiefly in Bengal,
a large number of birds disappear during the breeding time ; they do not, however,
leave India altogether, but select their abodes in the lower, impenetrable jungles of
the delta of the Ganges and Brahmapootra, called the Sunderbunds, where they were

found by my brother Hermann in large quantities, whilst at the same time they had

entirely disappeared in Bengal Proper.

            On Dredging in Weymouth Bay. By W. Thompson.

    The results of a day's dredging in Weymouth Bay, by Mr. Thompson, were read,
 by which it appeared that he had obtained thirteen species of Conchiferous MoUusks ;
 two of fish ; eight of Crustacea ; two Nudibranchiate Mollusks ; four Tunicated
 MoUusks; four Actiniadae ; one Cirrhipede ; one Medusa (floating) ; three Sponges;

 three Radiata ; and nine Annelides.
    Mr. Thompson also drew attention to the gregarious habit of Doris hilamellata

 in early spring, when they approach the shore for the purpose of depositing their

 coils of ova.

    He also drew attention to the constancy with which certain parasites in the dif-

 ferent families of nature are always found in the same species, and he instanced
 Adamsia palUaiia as always found on Pagurus Prideauxii ; Sagartia parasitica on
 Pagurus Bernhardus ; Halichondria suherea on Pagurus Furbesii, and very seldom on
  Pagurus Icevis ; Hydractinia echinata on Pagurus Bernhardus. Pecten opercularis,
 when young, is always attached by a byssus, and Pecten varius is attached through-

  out its existence.

     The dredging ground was on a rough shingle and coralline bottom in 10 fathoms
 water, in Weymouth Bay, about four miles from the shore.

                              Notes of a Visit to MitcJielstown Caves.

 By Dr. E. Percival Wright, Director of the Dublin University Museum.

     The author stated, that in company with Mr. Halliday, he, in the early part of
  August 1857, explored the extensive limestone caverns situated in the valley of
  Mitchelstown, between the Galtee and the Knockmildown ranges of mountains ; the
  object of the visit being to examine whether any of the curious blind animals, so well
 known as inhabiting the Carniola and other caves, could be found in Ireland.

     He gave a brief sketch of the geology of the district, of the various blind insects

  found on the continent and described by Schiodte, and of the Mitchelstown Cave, of
  which a ground-plan was exhibited ; and then stated that in the interior of the cave,
  and near some small pools of water formed by the dropping from the roof, specimens
  of a small white Lipura were discovered. This insect comes very near to the species
  figured by Schiodte, found in Adellesburg Cave ; but on a very careful examination

by Mr. Halliday, many differences were detected, more particularly the total absence
of ocelli, fourteen of which are figured by Schiodte on each side of the head of his
Lipura ; but not a trace of ocelli was found in the Mitchelstown Cave specimens.
Mr. Halliday observed that there were some other points, in which Schiodte's obser-
vations, or at least his interpretation of them, were at variance with what is known
of the common structure of this family. Hence he was led to hesitate as to the im-

portance to be attached to the diflferences noted. His Lipura, as well as another
species of the family (certainly Wind), Tritomurus scutellatus, had both been ascer-
tained to have an extensive range in the caves of the Austrian territory, and it did

not seem so improbable that they should occur in similar situations even in these
islands. The other species found in the Mitchelstown caves having distinct eyes, and
the structure of the anal fork agreeing with Macrotoma, could not be confounded

with the last-named insect.
   The list of the proper subterranean Fauna of the European caves (independent of

the immigrant animals which occur on the outer world also) had been largely added

to since Mr. A. Murray's paper " On Blind Insects and Blind Vision" was written.
Mr. Halliday submitted a list which, in its turn, would doubtless soon be antiquated
by the fresh investigations so diligently pursued by the Austrian naturalists. The

--present list comprises : Vertebrata, 1 ; Insecta, 31 ; Arachnida, 7 ; Myriapoda, 1

Crustacea, 5 ; Annelida, 1 ; MoUusca, 17.

                                               Physiology.

   The President of the Physiological Sub-Section said that it would be in the recol-
lection of several persons present, that in the year 1835. when the British Associa-
tion met first in Dublin, a Physiological or Medical Section had been formed and
had worked with great success, and that many important additions to science had
emanated from its labours. Since that period, however, at the meetings of the
Association which took place in the principal towns throughout the empire, no
Physiological Section existed, nor indeed had it been originally intended in the
arrangements for the present meeting in Dublin to establish any such Section as a
distinct one. It had been found, however, that many distinguished scientific medi-
cal men had assembled in the city, representing not merely England and Scotland,
but several of the Continental countries, and even America, and it was determined,
even at the present late hour, to organize a Sub-section, in which the labours of these
eminent medical men could be made available for the promotion of science, and he
(Professor Harrison) was happy to congratulate the meeting on the distinguished
array of gentlemen now assembled in this room.

  On certain a priori Principles of Biology. By Professor Alison, M.D.

   The writer stated that there were certain principles which shouM be admitted as
ultimate facts, as stated, very accurately, by Cuvier, because exceptions to the laws of
inorganic matter ; and that they formed the same basis for physiological science as
the principles of Gravity, the Inertia of Matter, or the Laws of Chemistry, for the
sciences of dead matter, and as certain inductive principles to the science of morals.
It might be said that the object of the paper was to apply the logic of the Scotch
school of metaphysics to physiological science ; but on account of the recent illness of
the distinguished author, the communication was incomplete*.

    * Dr. Gairdner, of Edinburgh, as a pupil of Professor Alison, explained the nature and ob-
ject of his distinguished preceptor's views, which he said were chiefly directed to oppose the
modern tendency of medical investigation, which he regarded as likely to degrade the science
to that of a subordinate department of chemistry on the one hand, and of mechanical science
on the other, omitting the one consideration of that indispensable though less intelligible class
of phenomena which were known to be vital.

I The author had frequently found auriculo-veutricular regurgitant murmurs, which
were not fully explained by the post-mortem appearances. He pointed out anato-
mical conditions of the valves at the time of their tension, which he believed have
not been suflSciently attended to ; and that these explained the occurrence in certain
otherwise obscure cases of regurgitant murmurs without organic lesions of the valves

or dilatation of the orifices.

        On the Mortality from certain Diseases. By Dr. Gaikdnek.

   The object of the author was to obtain a more accurate account of the causes of
death, especially in our hospitals, than yet obtained by the reports afforded by those
institutions. In the course of his remarks Dr. Gairdner commented upon the returns
of the Registrar-General, and stated that for the purposes of medical science they
were in many respects framed so as to mislead, from their referring only to a single
cause of death in each case, whereas the real fatal issues of disease were usually

very complex.

                       On the Oriental Bath.

By Edward Haughton, M.D. (Edinb.), M.R.C.S. Ed.

Antiquarians inform us that some of the most ancient ruins in the world aix those

of hot-air baths; whilst hot-water baths (to lie down in) are so modern as to have
been unknown to the Greeks. The former kind possesses many marked advantages

over the latter, both in purifying tlie blood, and as a simple detergent; being, more-

over, less liable to overheat the body ; the evaporation from the surface being a safe-
guard in the case of liot-air which does not exist when a denser medium is employed.

When the skin has been got to act well, soap and water ;ire then employed to remove
the impurities thus brought to the surface. The baths of tlie East are not only more

salutary than those which we are familiar with, but are infinitely pleasanter; as the

bath itself is a chamber permitting perfect freedom of motion. It is also of a social

character; a kind of bathing dress being worn of suflScient size to permit persons of

the same sex to meet together without embarrassment. This kind of bath is univer-

sally resorted to by Mahometans as a religious duty; indeed, on a rough calculation,
it may be said to be employed by ith of the human race. No objection on the head
of climate can be urged against this practice, as it is employed in so many and so

variable regions ; nor could it be used (as it is) by every class of society, if there were

anything in its nature to prevent it from being self supporting at a reasonable charge.

It appears, moreover, that certain forms of disease (here very prevalent) are scarcely

known at all  in  those  countries, where  the bath                     is  in  general  use                    and  that it also
                                                                                                             ;

possesses considerable curative efficacy, being capable of removing opium, nicotine,

alcohol, and other poisons from  the  blond                             so that it is not unreasonable to suppose,
                                                                     ;

that if it were introduced into this country, a great sanitary revolution would take

place. These circumstances render it worthy of the best attention of all reformers

and philanthropists.

On the Physiological Relations of Albumen. By Professor Hayden, 3I.D.

   The writer commenced with some preliminary observations tending to show that
the elimination by the excernent glands of the body of certain of the stamina! prin-
ciples of the blood, was indicative of derangement in the norrnaj proportion of its con-
stituent elements, whether resulting from temporary indigestion or confirmed disease;

                                                                                                                     A
                     TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                            Ill

and proceeded : " It is well known that the ' elements of respiration ' may be stored

up in the body by a process of deposition in the form of fat, to meet the urgent

demands involving a large expenditure of these elements, to which variation of external
temperature and other circumstances occasionally expose the animal. Not so, how-

ever, the ' plastic elements of nutrition;' these are appropriated only as required for

immediate use in the renovation of the tissues ; and if from any cause one of them
happen to be in excess in the blood, whether absolutely, as the direct result of indi-
gestion, or relatively, by loss of some of the allied constituents, then a process which

may be conveniently designated elemental adjustment is set up, by which the principle

in excess continues to be discharged from the system till it attains the normal pro-

portion relatively to the other staminal elements."

In proof of the existence of this self-adjusting power in the blood, the observation

of Kaupp was mentioned, to the effect that the quantity of chloride of sodium

excreted by the kidneys, usually observed a definite proportion to that taken by the

animal ; but if this salt be withhold for some time and then given in large quantity,

the kidneys are found to eliminate less than the quantity taken : also that of Andral,
" that the first effect of haemorrhage on the constitution of the blood is a decrease of

the corpuscles only; but if it (the haemorrhage) be prolonged or repeated, the albumen

and fibrine are found to have undergone a corresponding diminution." In such a

case, it is asserted by Becquerel and Rodier that the equilibrium is not restored

through the blood lost, in which the corpuscles and albumen observe a regular and

equal ratio of decrease with each subsequent bleeding. Albumen is occasionally found

in the urine of pregnancy, and may be accounted for on this hypothesis, by the loss

of blood-corpuscles, often to the amount of 27 parts in 1000, experienced by such
females who are peculiarly anaemic. An absolute or relative decrease of the fibrine, as

in scurvy and plethora, will give rise to spontaneous haemorrhage, by which the

equilibrium is restored between the fibrine and globules. The marked pallor in Bright's

disease indicates a loss of red corpuscles, amounting, according to the analyses of

Becquerel and Rodier, to nearly 10 per cent. The albumen likewise undergoes a

diminution, greatest towards the termination of the disease. In the chronic form

of this disease the decrease of corpuscles and albumen was still more marked, whilst

the fibrine had increased to a mean of 4" 37 per thousand.

In order to test the correctness of the views here set forth in general terms, the

following experiments were performed ; the object was threefold, viz. 1st, to deter-

mine the effect produced on the urine by inducing an absolute or relative increase

of albumen  in  the  blood                              2ndly,  the  action  of urea  on the  blood- corpuscles  as
                                                     ;

exhibited by the microscope ; and Srdly, the proportion of albumen contained in

the serous effusions of renal and cardiac dropsy respective!}'. With the first-men-

tioned object in view, blood was taken from living animals, the effect of which was

a decrease in the proportion of corpuscles and a relative increase of the albumen of

the circulating blood. An absolute increase of the albumen was produced by draw-

ing a small quantity of blood from an animal, and then injecting into the vein an

equal quantity of a solution of albumen of the temperature and specific gravity of

blood-serum. After having been operated upon, the animal was placed under a wire

crib on a concave zinc table, with an aperture in the bottom leading into a receiver,

--Ain which the urine was collected.
Experiment 1.        rabbit, weighing 3|lbs., was fed on cabbage, milk and water;

the urine passed next day was feebly alkaline, specific gravity 1020, and free of

albumen : the animal was then bled to 6 drachms, and fed on fresh grass and warm

milk ; the urine examined next day presented the same reaction and specific gravity,

--Abut became distinctly opalescent by heat and nitric acid.
Experiment 2.        dog, weighing 18lbs., was fed on milk and stirabout; urine

neutral, specific gravity 1020, contained no albumen : the animal was bled to 8

ounces on the 18th August; on the 19th, the urine collected during the previous night

was examined and found neutral, specific gravity 1030 ; it contained a trace of albu-
men. Examined again on the 20th, the urine was found alkaline; its specific gravity

had fallen to 1020, still a trace of albumen. Aug. 21, specific gravity 1022 ; albu-
men as on yesterday. The quantity of blood taken in the experiments was deter-

mined by the estimate of Welker, according to which the total quantity in the body

of an animal is equal to -^th. its weight.
--112 REPORT 1857.

   When the quantity of albumen held in solution is very small, the microscope
affords much aid in its detection. If a drop of the suspected liquid be placed on a

slip of glass in the field of the microscope, and a drop of nitric acid be added, a cloud
of minute vesicles will be observed to pass slowly over the field of view ; and if the
line of advance of this cloud be closely observed, the suddenness with which the
constituent vesicles start into view from an apparently structureless fluid, cannot

fail to arrest attention. These minute bodies present a highly refractive margin, with

--Aa light centre, and an average diameter of TooTo^b part of an inch.
Experiment 3.  young dog, weighing 12lbs. 7oz., was next subjected to experi-

ment. The urine collected before operating was free of albumen and alkaline, specific
gravity 1005. Blood was now drawn from the jugular vein to the amount of 5 ounces,

and into the aperture in the vessel was injected §ss of fresh dilute ov. -albumen
having the temperature and density of blood-serum. Bread and warm milk were

given as food, and ravenously eaten. The following day it was found that no urine

had been passed in the interim ; the second day after (Aug. 27th), 4 ounces of
urine were collected, neutral in reaction, of specific gravity 1030, and highly albu-

menous, being almost gelatinized by heat and nitric acid. The albumen was coagu-

lated and collected by filtration, dried, pulverized, and freed from impurities by ether

and boiling water, subsequently dried and incinerated ; the total quantity of pure
albumen thus obtained was 9 grains. In order to determine what proportion of
this was due to the ov. albumen injected, and what, if any, to the ser-alburaen dis-

charged in consequence of the bleeding, 1 ascertained the amount of pure dried albu-
men yielded by half an ounce of the white of egg, and found it to be 72|^ grains.

1 had expected, and probably would have found, had the operative part of the ex-

periment been in all respects successful, a balance in favour of the albumen excreted

in the urine, as compared with the quantity contained in half an ounce of the white
of egg, but unfortunately, at the moment when the last portion of albumen was in-

jected, and before a ligature could be applied to the open vessel, the dog struggled

violently and caused a fresh loss of blood, with probably a more than proportionate

loss of the albumen injected, as the bleeding occurred chiefly by regurgitation from

the heart. Five ounces of urine were obtained from this dog on 28th August, but

containing no trace of albumen.

   With regard to the action of urea on the blood-corpuscles, when exposed for a few
hours to a concentrated solution of urea, the corpuscles become tumid and many

entirely disappear ; the action, however, is slow and feeble.

  The proportion of albumen in the different dropsical effusions next engaged my

attention. If the hypothesis be well-founded, namely, that albuminaria is the result

of an effort of the blood to restore the equilibrium between its corpuscles and albu-

men by ridding itself of a portion of the latter, then we might not unreasonably ex-

pect to find the blood-serum effused coincidently into the cellular tissue and serous

cavities, bearing evidence of the same tendency by containing an excess of albumen.

With the view of determining this point by comparison between the fluids of renal

and cardiac dropsy, I analysed the serum obtained by acupuncture from two cases

of renal anasarca, and compared the results with those obtained by Audral from his

analyses of the serum of cardiac dropsy. The proportion of albumen obtained by

Andral ranged between 4 and 48 parts in a thousand in my two analyses the pro-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

portion was 12 and 24 per thousand respectively. I should desire, before coming

to any definite conclusion on this point, to pursue this portion of the inquiry still

further.

The inherent property of quantitative adjustment in the blood would appear to have

reference mainly to nutrition, which requires as an essential condition for its healthy

exercise, certain fixed mutual proportions between the constituent elements of the

blood. The maintenance of the normal relative density of the serum and corpuscles

is obviously subserved also by this property.

  The appearance of albumen in the urine is either transitory or persistent. When

transitory, it is produced either by an error of excess in the use of proteine substances,

of which the blood seeks to relieve itself through the kidneys ; or by a state of con-
gestion of these organs, in which the blood-serum transudes to walls of the renal

capillaries and is discharged with the urine. When persistent, it is probably always

the result of continued loss or solution of the blood-corpuscles, and produced by an

                                                                                          d

inherentself-regulating property in the blood, by which the normal relative proportion

between its constituent elenaents is sought to be re-established.
    In acute renal dropsy the point de depart in the blood-changes would appear to be

loss of albuinen ; but in the chronic form of the disease attended with ursemia, the

starting-point probably is solution of the corpuscles.
   The loss of albumen experienced by the blood in Bright's disease would appear to

be inversely proportioned to the quantity which appears in the urine, and probably

in the dropsical effusion.

   The quantity of fibrine in the blood is regulated in great part by that of the cor-
puscles, not by " adjustment," but in virtue of the causal relation subsisting between
the disintegration of the one and the production of the other.

   Diminution by removal, therefore, of the quantity of globules in the blood will not
necessarily cause elimination of the fibrine, because it involves diminished production
of the latter ; but the converse of the proposition will not hold, as diminished pro-

portion of fibrine, by whatever cause produced, may give rise to elimination of the

blood-corpuscles in the form of hsemorrhage.

          On certain Pailwlogical Characters of the Blood Corpuscles.

                               By 3. P. Hennessy.

   The author stated the results of his microscopical observations on healthy blood,
and on inflamed blood. The result to which he directed particular attention was,
that in inflamed blood the corpuscles were smaller and darker than in healthy blood.
In corroboration of his views, he quoted the remarks of M. Donne, of Mr. Wharton
JoneSj Mr. Gulliver, and many others. Upon this change of size Mr. Hennessy
founded a theory of inflammation ; the increase of temperature, the occurrence of the

buffy coat and the other phenomena being satisfactorily explained.

  Dr. Lankester laid on the table a number of the Tables issued by the Com-
mittee for the Registration of Periodic Phenomena. These Tables were filled up,
but he complained that every year persons took the tables, promising to fill them in,

but failed to send them to the Committee.

On the Alternation of Generatio7is and Parthenogenesis in Plants and
            Animals. By E. Lankester, M.D., F.R.S.

The author, after alluding to the phenomena of "Alternation" as described by

Steenstrup in the Entozoa, Medusee, and Sertularian polyps, and to the phenomena

--of Parthenogenesis, described by Owen and Von Siebold, concluded his paper as

follows : " If we turn now to the vegetable kingdom, we find perfectly analogous

phenomena presenting themselves. In fact, the modifications of the reproductive

function, which have recently excited so much surprise in the animal kingdom, are

the normal forms of the function among plants. In the roots and branches of a tree

we have a gigantic ' nurse,' and the buds are its progeny. Just as we find the same

secondary products called ' gemmae,' in animals either remaining adherent to their

parent-stocks, as in the Sertularian and other zoophytes, or floating off, as in Hydra

and many others, so we find the buds of plants remaining attached to the tree, or

becoming separated from it. Just, too, as we find a different form assumed by the

secondary offspring of the ' nurse,' as in the scolex-head of the cystic-worm, so we

find in such cases as those presented by the 'bulbillus,' the 'bulb,' and the 'sporule,'

different forms assumed by partshaving the same relations in the plant as in the animal.

So likewise in the plant we find a greater change of the secondary offspring taking

place, when sexes are developed and flowers are produced, and the hermaphrodite

flower, with its stamens and pistils, is the representative of the segments (proglottides)

Weof the tape- worm, with its male and female apparatus in a common envelope.

may go yet further with our analogies in the vegetable kingdom. Here also we have

numerous cases in which the germ-cell, the ovule, is produced, and developes within

itself an embryo, quite independent of the influence of the sperm-cell, the pollen."

The paper was illustrated by the following diagram :

 On the Importance of introdiicing a New and Uniform Standard of Micro-
                   metric Measurement. By Professor Lyons.

   The author alluded to the great difficulties experienced by observers in enumerating,
recording, and remembering the various kinds of measures now in use in these coun-
tries and on the Continent, portions of the English and French inch and line, and
decimal parts of the French wiUimetre. The high figure in the denominator and the
number of decimal places are exceedingly cumbrous. He (Dr. Lyons) would pro-
pose that some definite micrometric integer should be assumed, being a determinate
part of unity. He proposed that this measure should be denominated a Microline.
He did not mean definitely to bind himself to the adoption of any particular standard,
but would propose provisionally that the one ten -thousandth part of the English inch
should be assumed and denominated the standard Microline j)ro tern. The size of

microscopic objects could thus be recorded simply, by saying they were one, two,

three, or more Microlines in diameter. He would have his hearers bear in mind the
present tendency of scientific men towards a decimal system. For his own part, he

would prefer to assume as the standard Microline, some minute subdivision of the
French decimal scale.

   Professor Lyons exhibited an instrument for the local application of chloroform,
the invention of Dr. Hardy of Dublin, which for simplicity and effectiveness he
thought contrasted very favourably with any similar instrument he had yet seen.

On the Valvular Apparatus connected with the Vascular System of certain
            Abdominal Viscera. By Robert M'Donnell, M.D.

  A series of drawings were exhibited, showing the anatomical structure and arrange-

ment of the valves situated at or near the point where the renal veins open into the

vena cava ascendens in various animals as well as man.
   The author having spoken also of the beautiful valvular structures which in the

lower animals are so constantly found guarding, more or less, completely the mouths
of the hepatic veins, detailed some experiments performed by him, which seem to
show not only an anatomical but physical grounds that these valves cannot act

otherwise than in preventing, or at least checking any regurgitation of venous blood

into the vessels thus guarded : on these grounds he was opposed to the so-called
" Hepatico -renal" circulation.

                                          Note on Electric Fishes.

             By Sir J. Richardson, C.B., M.D., LL.D., F.R.S.

    The author stated that there were not less than eleven genera of fishes known
 that had the power of giving electric shocks. There was one peculiarity in all these
 fishes, and that was the absence of scales. In every one of them an apparatus had
 been discovered which consisted of a series of galvanic cells put in action by a
 powerful system of nerves. He read extracts from a letter from Dr. Baikie, now
 engaged in exploring the Niger, in which that gentleman stated he had met with
 an electric fish in Fernando Po, and which he believed was identical with the
^Malapterurus, which had been described by Dr. Wilson, from the coast of Old Cala-

 bar. The natives called this fish the Tremble-fish.

  On the Employment of the Living Electric FisJies as Medical Shock-
                   Machines. By Professor G. Wilson.

The author stated, that in prosecuting researches into the early history of the
                                                                                              8*

electric machine, he did not contemplate going further back than the seventeenth
century, or commencing with any earlier instrument than Otto Guericke's sulphur

globe of 1670. His attention, however, had been incidentally directed to the employ-

ment of the living torpedo as a remedial agent by the ancient Greek and Roman
physicians, and he now felt satisfied that a living electric fish was alike the earliest

and the most familiar electric instrument employed by mankind. In proof of the

antiquity of the practice, he adduced the testimony of Galen, Dioscorides, Scribonius,

and Asclepiades, whose works proved that the shock of the torpedo had been used

Aas a remedy in paralytic and neuralgic affections before the Christian era.                                    still

higher antiquity had been conjecturally claimed for the electric Silurus, or Mala-

pterurus of the Nile, on the supposition that its Arabic name, raad, signifies thunder-

fish, and implies a very ancient recognition of the identity in nature of the shock-

giving power and the lightning force ; but the best Arabic scholars have pointed out

that the words for thunder (raad) and for the electric fish (raa'dd) are different, and
that the latter signifies the " causer of trembling" or " convulser" ; so that there

are no grounds for imputing to the ancient Egyptians, or even to the Arabs, the

identification of Silurus-power with the electric force. In proof of the generality of
the practice of employing the living zoo-electric machine at the present day, the
author referred to the remedial application of the torpedo by the Abyssinians, to
that of the Gymnotus by the South American Indians, and to that of the recently-

discovered electric fish {Malaj)terurus Benincnsis) by the dwellers on the Old Calabar
River, which, strictly speaking, flows into the Bight of Biafra, but by a looser geo-
graphical interpretation is held to enter the Bight of Benin. The native Calabar

women are in the practice of keeping one or more of the fishes in a basin of water,
and bathing their children in it daily, with a view to strengthen them by the shocks

which they receive. These shocks are certainly powerful, for living specimens of the
Calabar fish are at present in Edinburgh, and a single one gives a shock to the hand
reaching to the elbow or even to the shoulder. The usages referred to appear to
have prevailed among the nations following them from time immemorial, so that

they furnish proof of the antiquity as well as of the generality of the practice under

notice.

   The author concluded by directing the attention of naturalists to the probability

of additional kinds of electrical fish being discovered, and to the importance of
ascertaining what the views of the natives familiar with them are in reference to the

source of their power and to their therapeutic employment.

                      Miscellaneous.

On the Functions of the Human Ear. By Professor H. Carlile, M.D.

   Dr. Carlile made some observations on the manner in which sounds are reflected
by the auricle and external meatus of the human ear, and so caused to fall on the

membrana tympani. He showed that after reflexion from the surface of the concha,

and from a cavity formed by the inner surface of the tragus, they are received upon

a third concave surface, or reflector, situated at the upper and back part of the tube,

where the cartilaginous joins the osseous portion of the meatus, whence they are

transmitted, some directly to the surface of the membrana tympani, falling upon it

obliquely, and others to the outer and lower part of the tube, reflected from which

they fall on the membrana tympani nearly at right angles. The first three reflecting

surfaces are the chief seats of the sebaceous glands, those appertaining to the second

and third surfaces secreting the substance called the cerumen, or wax, of the ear,

distinguished by its yellow colour and bitterness. This bitter secretion is very pro-

bably, as it is generally described, a preventive of the ingress of insects, as these are

not found to enter the tube of the ear even when persons sleep upon the ground in

places swarming with  insects, such as  earwigs, &c.                                                            but it is very likely that these
                                                                                                             ;

sebaceous secretions also serve the purpose of a varnish, which, being spread over

the reflecting surfaces, produces a smoothness, and a regularity of curve, favourable

to the transmission by reflexion of the pulses of sound in their passage to the mem-

brana tympani. It is highly probable that slight deafnesses, such as are occasion-
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  Il7

ally the result of exposure to cold, are produced by triHing alterations in the quantity

or quality of this secretion, which, when very abundant, is known to cause nearly

complete incapacity of hearing, until the accumulation be removed. In this respect
the ear seems to possess an analogy with the other organs of sense, the skin, the
tongue, the nose, and the eye, in all of which the normal condition of the surface
secretions is necessary for the due performance of the specific function of the organ.
Dr. Carlile also called attention to the form of the external ear in some species of the
Vespertilionidce, more especially in the Plecotus auritus. In this animal the external
ear consists of a large posterior auricle, almost as long as the body of the creature,

and a small anterior auricle, nearly symmetrical with the larger, the tube of the ear
opening at the lower part of these appendages, in front of the larger, and behind the
smaller. The smaller auricle is generally regarded as an operculum, which prevents
the entrance, into the tube of the ear, of the air, when the animal flies with rapidity
in pursuit of its prey or against the wind ; but more probably, like the tragus, its
homologue in the human ear, it serves as a reflector, receiving on its back or inner
surface many rays of sound, sent by reflexion from the front or hollow surface of
the larger auricle, and reflecting them again to the same surface, whence they are
transmitted, either by one reflexion or by several, between the opposed surfaces of
the large and small auricles, to the tube of the ear, in order to reach the membrana
tympani. Were it not for this provision, many rays of sound, after a first reflexion
from the surface of the larger auricle, would pass into the air, and be altogether lost.
The large size of the cochlea in some Vespertilionidee, found in connexion with the
great expansion of the auricle, would seem adverse to the opinion that the cochlea is
the portion of the internal ear specially adapted to receive sounds conveyed by con-
duction through the solid parts of the head, the great reflecting power of the auricles

being one of the distinguishing characteristics of the organ.

Periodical Phenomena at Llangefelach, Glamorganshire," were presented.

On the Ethnological and Physical Characters of the Negro variety of man-
  kind. By Antoine D'Abbadie, Correspondent of the French Institute.

The following statements were founded chiefly on the author's own observations

collected during a ten years' stay in Eastern Ethiopia.
   The settlement of the negroes in Africa was effected by a stream of immigration

flowing from east to west. The negro tribes who live now in the most easterly parts
have the largest facial angle, the greatest amount of intelligence, and can be referred,
by slow and almost imperceptible gradations of form and colour, to the red races of
Ethiopia, which all authors have until now agreed in referring to the Caucasian
stock. From his total inability to decide whether several individuals of the
Doggo, Barya, and Nara tribes belonged to red or to negro origin, he has been forced
to conclude that all future controversies on the creation of negro varieties of man-
kind must take into account the fact of a gradual formation of the black variety, or
at least must explain, in the uncalled-for hypothesis of a separate negro creation,
how tribes living in continual war with their neighbours, have amongst themselves,
and spontaneously as it would seem, several individuals who must be referred to a
variety alike alien to the majority of their relations and to that of their fellow-

countrymen.
   The author proceeded to quote several facts drawn from tribes living at opposite

extremities of Ethiopia and separated by an extent of country equal to the breadth

of France. It is inferred from these facts, that in tropical Africa the skin of man
is blackened when the chief food is not animal, but vegetable. Numerous direct
observations prove that the air of Ethiopia differs from that of Europe by some very
--118 REPORT 1857.

remarkable properties, which may have likewise a hitherto unrecognized effect in
blackening the human skin. Finally, the traveller quoted several cases where the
skin was notoriously blackened, with or without apparent malady, in the same per-
son living in the very peculiar Ethiopian climate. This latter fact is generally
believed and asserted by the Ethiopians themselves.

              The Human Hand, an Index of Mental Development.
                         By Richard Beamish, F.R.S.

   The author first alludes to the labours of Lavater, Gall, Sir Charles Bell, Earl
Gustav Carus, and others, who have sought to demonstrate the value of the symbol-
ical system, dwelling more at length on those of Georg Meissner, as furnishing, in
his ' Anatomic und Physiologie der Haut,' the fullest demonstration of the nerve
of touch as contradistinguished from that of feeling; and of D'Arpentigny, as offer-
ing, in his ' Chirognomie ou I'art de reconnaitre les Tendances de la Main,' the first
definite and practical illustrations of the value of the hand in ethnological inquiries.

  --The author then proceeds to consider the several portions of the hand the palm

as indicative of temperament ; the development of the thumb as significant of power;
and the form of the fingers as expressive of social and intellectual character; refer-
ence being made to numerous tracings of the hands of individuals of different
nations, whereby the great importance of the study of the hand by the ethnologist
was inferred.

    The necessity for a more extended knowledge of the reUgious and social instincts
of nations was strongly urged, and the effects of ignorance in this department of
science illustrated by reference to our sj'stems of government both at home and
abroad, in Ireland, and in India, where the nationalities of the people had been
equally disregarded, and as a consequence, equally productive of results not only
disappointing, but disastrous.

       On the Physical Characters of the Ancient and Modern Germans.
                             By John Beddoe, M.D.

    All accounts of the physical character of the ancient Germans agree in representing
them as a very light-complexioned people, having hair redder or yellower than that
of the Gauls, themselves considered as fair by the Italians. Niebuhr, Bunsen and
Prichard, however, agree in thinking that their descendants, as a rule, do not answer
to these descriptions, and have to a great extent ceased to be the xanthous race they

were in the time of Tacitus. I am disposed, however, to doubt whether the differ-

ences in complexion between the Italians and the most pure-blooded Germans were
any more marked in that age than they are at present. There are reasons for not
taking too literally Tacitus' statements as to the remarkable uniformity of complexioa
in the ancient Germans : ^avObi and Jlavus, as applied to the colour of hair, probably
meant chestnut or light brown rather than bright yellow ; wvppos, which means
literally " flame-coloured," and rutilus, an epithet often applied to gold, may have
included bright yellow as well as what we call red. The use of soap as a cosmetic by
both Gauls and Germans had probably a great effect on the colour of the hair. Ob-
serve the light hue of the locks of Venetian ladies in the portraits of the I6th century,
though their eyes, and the eyes and hair of their spouses, are represented as dark.
This light colour is known to have been produced by the use of an alkaline ley.

    Id order to ascertain with accuracj' some of the physical characters of the modern

--Germans, I have made observations in most parts of their country, and have noted

the colour of the hair and eyes in Holland, in 1133 individuals; in Belgium, in 4023;
in North-Western Germany, in 2545 ; in Prussia, Saxony, &c., in 1220 ; at Vienna,
in 1807 ; and in other parts of Austria, in 1659 : I have seen but very few natives
of Swabia and Bavaria, and not many Swiss.
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  119:

   The general result of these investigations is, that hair of a very strongly red hue
is in scarcely any of the districts I have visited so common as it is in many parts of
Scotland, and even of Ireland. The exceptions to this statement are tv^o somewhat

remarkable ones : the first is that of the peasantry about Cologne and Dusseldorf,

whose ancestors, whether Sicambri or other Franks, may have had much to do with
originating in the minds of their near neighbours, the Roman colonists, ideas relative
to the German complexion and physiognomy. The other is that of the peasantry

to the west of Eisenach.

   Red hair is decidedly uncommon in Friesland, and somewhat so in Holland and

Flanders ; but blond hair of various shades, from flaxen and light brown to yellow,
and even pale golden verging on red, prevails in all parts where the true Teutonic

blood can well be supposed pure, including all that country between the Rhine and
Elbe which is considered by Dr. Latham to be the homeland of the race. The same

may be said of several districts in which we have reason to know that the Germans
established numerous colonies. The proportion of light to dark eyes varies consider-

ably : it is very large in Groningen, and small in Flanders, where, as in most parts
of Germany, and in some of the Saxon districts of Britain, the combination of hazel
or brown eyes with light hair is common. 1 found the Frisians a remarkably comely
people, tall and well-made, with oval crania and faces, regular features, and noses
of good length, straight or very slightly arched : the eyes are generally light blue or
light grey and well-opened ; the hair is, I think, much more often flaxen or light

brown than strongly yellow. The Westphalian Saxons seemed to me shorter in
stature ; with heads shorter, though still oval, and faces broader and heavier, and

hair more often inclined to red. Beyond the Elbe and Saale, where Slavish blood
assuredly predominates over German, the prevailing type changes accordingly ; dark
and even black hair become common ; the head is often of the Slavonic form, short

and broad, especially behind the ears, and flattened at the back. The Upper Au-
strians look like true Germans, but I have seen natives of the Alpine valleys who had
narrow square foreheads, prominent supra- orbital ridges, dark grey eyes and black-
ish hair, and who altogether so much resembled one of the common Irish types as
to call to mind the ancient Celts of Noricura. The Lower Austrian s, whatever else
they may be, have not the form or complexion of Germans. Their heads sometimes
present the Slavish, sometimes even the Turanian (Avar ?) type ; and they are
generally dark-haired. The Styrians are a mixed people, and apparently in part

Celtic. In the Thuringerwald, at Riihla, near Eisenach, and not far from the fair-

haired Hessians, I found a peculiar people of very dark complexion. The domain
of the German type extends thence across the Rhine ; but on entering the Walloon
country, which surrounds Liege, a remarkable change is observable : the people are
distinguishable from their Teutonic neighbours by dark, often black hair, gaunt
angular forms, square foreheads and narrow pointed chins ; in fact, they have the

characters assigned by W. F. Edwards to the Ciinbrian race*.

   In many cities, as will be observed in the following Table, which exhibit in a form
suitable for comparison some of my data for the colours of eyes and hair, the popu-
lation is darker than in the surrounding rural districts. It might be wrong to con-

clude from these facts that a city life, continued generation after generation, exercises
a modifying influence on the colours : for this diflFerence is not universal even in

Germany ; it is greatest in Cologne, a Roman colony. The Germans being fairer

than almost any other people, foreign immigration almost necessarily implies dark-
ening, and such immigration takes place into cities almost exclusively. Lastly, I
have found that at Liege, and in some parts of Italy, where the foreign element is
likely to have been xanthous, the peasantry are darker than the urban population.

   On the whole, I conclude that the Germans were in the time of the Romans a
people fairer than the Gauls, and very strikingly fairer than the Romans and other

southern Europeans ; that their hair, however, was probably often light brown or
flaxen, and not always red or even yellow ; and that this description applies at the
present day to such of their descendants as are likely to have preserved their blood

tolerably pure.

Ethnological and Antiquarian Researches in New Granada, Quito and Pent,

   with Observations o)i the Pre-Incareal, Incareal, and the Monuments of

  neighbouring Nations in Peru. By W. Bollaert, F.R.G.S., Corre~

   sponding Member of the University of Chile, &ic.

The author says, when passing through the West Indies, that one looks in vain for

even a specimen of the aboriginal inhabitant of the Antilles, once so populous ; one
only sees a few whites, the population being principally negroes, and the numberless

mixtures of white and black, but the natives have long since been exterminated by

the ruthless Spanish invader.

  The coast of New Granada was visited, the tropical vegetation of which is wonder-

ful, and where the "Victoria Regia" was found in some places in such abundance

Ain the rivers as to be a troublesome weed.         few scattered remnants of Indian

tribes are met with on the coast, but in the interior they are more numerous.

  The principal Indian nation of New Granada is generally called Muysea: this

word means a man, but Chibeha is the proper term for the nation.

Some modern writers state that Quetzalcoatl, the legislator of Mexico, Bochiea

of Bogota, and Maneo Capae, were Buddhist priests ; the result of Mr. Bollaert's
inquiries in those countries, leads him to set such down as mere ideas, and to have

no foundation whatever.

The author crossed the Isthmus and saw some of the Darien Indians at Panama,

rather fine-looking people ; they went about almost naked, and the general impression
is that the white man is not safe in their wilds. There is now a railroad across the

Isthmus. The scheme of a ship canal for the present is abandoned ; most things

are possible, but a ship canal through the Isthmus is very improhahle.

  The population of New Granada is 2,363,000, composed of VYhites, Cuarterones,

Mestyes, Indians, civilized and savage. Mulattos, Zambos, and Negroes.

The author expresses surprise that monuments of more ancient nations than those

conquered by the Spaniards have not been discovered in this country and in the

same abundance as have been found in Mexico, Yucatan, and Cheapos, and adds,

perhaps the dense tropical forests cover such remains, and are awaiting the foot-

steps of the antiquarian explorer.

The Chibehas (Muyseas) had a species of calander, and had necessarily advanced

in a peculiar species of civilization, but then there is but little left to throw any Hght

on their architecture. They buried in tombs, with various precious ornaments, in-

cluding objects in gold and emeralds. Their places of adoration were lakes and rivers,

into which were thrown their offerings.

   Scattered about the country stone ruins exist, supposed to be the work of natives
anterior to the Chibehas. Near Lieva is one of these spots, and called " Little Hell ;

and the "Devil's Cushions" are stone columns lying on the ground j also a great
stone table of sacrifice. Caves full of mummies are often met with ; in these crania
of more ancient nations than the Chibehas may be found.

  Quito is an interesting portion of the New World, celebrated by being under the

equator, its capital being 10,000 feet above the sea ; for the great elevation of its

volcanic mountains, including Chimboi-azo ; and as having been the seat of a very

ancient civilization long before it was conquered by the Caras or by the Incas of Peru.

In earlier times the country was governed by Quitus and conquered by the Caras.

The Caras had taken possession of the coast about a.d. 800, and their chiefs were
called Scyris, or lords of all. These Caras may have separated at a very early date

from the Chimus of Trujello, or from the great Chineha family.

The Caras made their way to Quito by the river Esmeraldas about a.d. 1000

they  adored  the  sun  and  moon, and  were  less  barbarous  than  the Quitus                                             they
                                                                                                                         ;

clothed in skins, woven cloths of wool and cotton, and their year was regulated by

the solstices ; they are said to have had twelve pillars round their temple to the Sun,

which served as gnomons. Although the Scyris adored the sun, they did not, as

the Peruvians, call themselves " Children of the Sun." Their architecture has not

Aso far advanced as the Peruvian.       wreath of feathers was worn by all who bore

arms; the Scyri added to their wreath or crown of feathers, a large emerald.
--122 REPORT 1857-

   Instead of the Peruvian quiper, they had pieces of wood, clay, stones of various
sizes, colours and forms, by which was expressed principal occurrences, these being
kept in compartments in their temples, tombs, and dwellings.

   According to the reading of the coloured stones, 700 years is given by some for the
reigns of eighteen or nineteen Scyris ; other readers give fifteen Scyris and 500 years
up to the death of Cacha Duchicela, who was conquered by Huayna Capae, the

Peruvian Inca.
   The eighth Scyri conquered towards the south, making inroads upon the Puruhas

of Liribamba.

By the death of the eleventh Scyri, about a.d. 1300, the male line of the Scyris

was extinguished, when Toa, his daughter, was declared the successor; she married

Duchicela, the eldest son of Condorazo, chief of the Puruhas, who reigned seventy

years ; was succeeded by his son Antachi, the thirteenth Scyri, and died about a.d.

1370. Guallca, his eldest son, being of a bad disposition, his brother Huaicopo was

put in his place, who died about 1463, leaving his kingdom to Cacha, the fifteenth

Scvri, leaving an only daughter, Paccha, who succeeded him.

   Huayna Capae, twelfth Inca of Peru, went against Quito in 1475 ; Cacha was
mortally wounded, when his daughter Paccha was declared the Scyri. Huayna

Capae, however, made overtures of marriage to Paccha, who was then twenty years

of age, and by the law of Quito, whosoever she married could reign with her.

Paccha consented, Atahualpa being her first son. Huayno Capae reigned thirty years

over Quito, and at his death he gave the kingdom of Quito to his son Atahualpa,

the empire of Peru descending to Huasca.

According to some, the natives of Quito called the supreme power Con: that Pacha-

Acamac was the son of Con.  temple was built on the coast of Peru to Pachacamac,

where he was worshiped as the invisible God ; it would seem, however, that the

first Inca taught his people that the Sun was the Supreme Power, and that Con and

Pachacamac were his offspring; also that he the Inca was a child of the Sun.

Under the 9th Inca, the country of Curysmancun, whose capital was at Pachaca-

mac, was conquered by the Peruvians, when the Incareal theology was in danger

from the purer one of Pachacamac ; however, it was arranged that Pachacamac should

--retain his temples, and that others should be built to the Sun.
   Peru. Mr. Bollaert states, that in 1852 he communicated to the Ethnological

Society a paper on the Incas and Inchans of Peru, noticing principally some points
in early Peruvian history, and opposing the ideas of such writers as Ranking, who

have given as their opinion, that the Peruvians had an Asiatic origin in the thirteenth
century, that Manco Capae was the son of Glengis Khan ! and that the term Inga

comes from the Mongol word Ungut ! ! The author also noticed that the dynasty

of the Incas was rather modern, and that they had probably built some of their

cities upon the ruins of those of more ancient nations, and adverted to those curious
remains, the " Pintados," or Indian Pictography, observed by him in 1827 in Tara-

paca. In 1853 Mr. Bollaert again visited South America, and extended his obser-

vations.

   Adverting to the history, &c. of the aborigines south of Panama, Puna, and Tum-

bez, he dwells somewhat upon the history and remains met with at Trujello, the land

of the ancient Chimus. During the time of the Inca Pachacuter, there reigned in
this part of the country the chief Chimu-Canchu : the Inca Jupanqui made success-
ful war upon this nation, which had to abandon the worship of idols and follow that
of the Sun. The Chimu ruins are very extensive, the architecture and ornaments
simple and elegant. Here then we have the ruins of a nation nearly as powerful as
that of the Incas : there are also here Incareal remains. The Chimu Huacas or
tombs have yielded, amongst other things, many rich ornaments in gold and silver.
The author has deposited in the British Museum, with other pieces of pottery, a fine
specimen of art, a vase forming the head of an Inca, having the lobes of the ears

enlarged and known as an "Orejon*."

ties, principally from Trujello.

The author enters into details of various collections of ruins in the north of Peru,

not of Incareal origin, such as those of Cuelap, Huanuco, Patuelca, Pachacamac, &c.

He also gives some particulars of the tombs of Caiiete, anciently called the beautiful

vallej's of the Guarcu, which formed the state of the Chuqui-Mancu. The Chincha

islands take their name from the ancient great Chincha nation of the coast, and it is

supposed that there is guano only for ten years if it is taken away in such quantities

as at present. At Arica, in 18° S., are many Huacas or tombs containing mum-

Amies, pottery, and various other curiosities.  cave is also described as existing in

the Mirro or headland of Arica.

Mr. Bollaert was some time in the province of Tarapaca, famed for the existence

there of inexhaustible quantities of nitrate of soda, about 50,000 tons of which are

Aannually exported.  new mineral of boracic acid has lately been met with there.

The celebrated silver mines of Huantajaya are in this province ; copper exists in large

quantities as well as other metals.

   On the arid hills and mountains of the province of Tarapac^, Mr. Bollaert dis-
covered the " Pintados," or ancient Indian Pictography. The figures are of large

size, produced by taking away the loose dark pieces of stone in outline from the sur-

face of the mountain. This peculiar species of Pictography he at first considered to

have been done by the ancient as well as by the present Indians for amusement, but

his recent researches show that they are Huacas or sacred spots, some of them being
ancient burial-places. 1, called " Las Rayas," is laid out as if for a garden, with

a large double circle in the centre, the paths rendered hard by the feet of people

religious ceremonies may have been performed here. 2 is composed of oblong

Afigures. 3. large double circle and oblong figures. 4. Irregular designs, figures

of Indians, puma and llama. 5 is the most interesting, made up of compart-

ments ; in one of these was found an ancient grave containing the body of a female

in a dress of feathers. The "White Horse," near Oldbury Castle in Wilts, is of
this sort of " Pintados."

Near to the rich copper deposit in the Andes of Yabricoya, an interesting monu-

ment was fallen in with in the Parapa del Leon. Here is a large isolated block of

granite covered with old Indian sculptures. The centre group is a man wrestling

with a puma ; there are also figures of llamas, guanacos, circles, serpents, &c. These

--figures have been picked out by a pointed instrument say of hard brass.

Mr. Bollaert concludes by referring to the many ancient monuments existing in-

Peru, separating the Incareal from those of neighbouring and more ancient nations,

assisting at least, with the labours of others, in the collecting of materials for the

ancient history of Peru.

He examined the coal mines of Chile, and paid a second visit to Arauco. The

Chilian government have it in contemplation to colonize that part of Chile ; some
think this may be done amicably, whilst others foresee, should such be attempted, a

sanguinary war would result. Mr. Bollaert saw some of the Araucanos ; they looked
a superior race, and as if they would resist inroads into their lovely valleys filled with

cattle and horses, and studded with the magnificent Araucaria, yielding them abun-

dance of nuts forming their bread.

         On the Routes of Communication between England and India.

            By Major-General Chesney, R,A., D.C.L., F.R.S.

   The importance of a rapid communication with India is now an admitted fact by

the whole of Europe. In reality it should have been so considered in past times, nor
can it ever be otherwise so long as India remains a dependency of Great Britain.
Since I had the honour of addressing the Section on this subject at Belfast, in 1852,
the question of our communication with India by the line of the Euphrates has taken
a much higher position than it then occupied in public attention. But before going
on to the few remarks which I wish to make to you on this subject, I should like to
point out to you the various existing and proposed lines of route to India, in order

that you may have clearly before your mind what it is that I am anxious to accom-
plish by this Euphrates route of which you have so often heard. You all know our
long sea line to India round the Cape, as well as the existing line by the Red Sea
--124 REPORT 1857.

and Aden to Kurrachee and Calcutta. The line proposed by Sir Rowland Macdonald
Stevenson, and which is apparently the one preferred by Lord Palmerston, passes

over the Balkan, the Taurus and other mountain ranges quite regardless of engineer-

ing diflSculties. But if a direct line be drawn along the globe from London to Bom-
bay or Kurrachee, it exactly takes in the route by the Valley of the Euphrates ; con-

sequently this portion of the line has necessarily formed a part of all the various
projects that have been advanced with a view to facilitating and shortening our com-

munication with India, with one exception, brought to my notice in a paper read

last year at Cheltenham, which is supposed to go from Acre across the desert to

--Bussorah. The distance by the two overland routes are as follows :

                                                                                                                                    English miles.

the diflference in favour of the Euphrates Valley being 1 104^ miles. The great gain,
therefore, is from the entrance of the Red Sea and Persian Gulf onward. From the

Red Sea to Kurrachee we have 1705 English miles ; whilst we have only 702 from

the head of the Persian Gulf to the same port, or less than one-half. In the one

case we have the monsoon right ahead towards Aden ; in the other it is nearly abeam

--to Ormuz I need scarcely add, a difficult and dangerous navigation in the one case,

and a perfectly safe one in the other. The completion of the proposed arrangements

would enable us to get over this distance and carry mails and passengers from Lon-

don to Kurrachee in thirteen days and a half, or less than half the time at present

occupied in the transit by the Red Sea ; while, by laying down an electric telegraph

line by this route, we may, in eighteen or twenty hours, be assured of the welfare
of some friend or relative in a distant part of India, whose fate is now a matter

of uncertainty and anxiety. I should just point out to you also that the pro-

posed railway will form a chain of communication with those lines up the valley

of the Indus, &c., now in progress of completion in India, and will thus give

us as direct a route as can be had between London and Lahore. But the rapidity

of rail and electric communication forms but a small portion of the benefits which,

in a political, military, commercial, and social point of view, will result from

opening up the Euphrates Valley route to India. No country possesses associa-

Wetions of such deep and historical interest as this.     have here the first seat
-- --of mankind the sites of the four primaeval cities of the Bible the empires of

Cyrus the Great, Cyrus the Younger, and of the great follower of his steps,

Alexander, whose conquests and unparalleled marches of 19,020 miles (according to

a careful calculation which I have made), laid the foundation of that connexion
of the East with the West which is now under consideration. The Romans

also were alive to the great importance of this territory ; for after the empire
of Seleucus had passed away, we read of the attempt of Crassus to conquer

the country 53 years B.C., and of the expedition of Trajan a.d. 106. Julian the

Apostate followed in the steps of Trajan, a.d. 361. He built a fleet on the banks of

the Euphrates, descended the river, and, according to Gibbon, encountered there a

most terrific  hurricane at  a  spot  answering  to  the  present El Kaim,  above Anah
                                                                                                                                    ;

and it is remarkable that it was apparently nearly at the same spot that the expedi-

tion which I had the honour of commanding was visited by a similar and equally

fearful hurricane in May 1836. From the period of Julian, a.d. 363, we have no

record of any great militarv' expedition in connexion with Western Asia until Napo-

leon conceived the idea in 1809 of transporting a force down the Euphrates with a

view to the invasion of India. All his calculations and arrangements were made for
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  125

this end. His troops were to have been transported on rafts, constructed of timber
cut down in the vicinity and on the banks of the river and sea coast. With a little
of his daring we might do the same at this moment, and with much greater facility.
There have been various proposals at different times for opening a communication
with India by the Euphrates Valley. That which took the most practical shape was
elaborated by Lieutenant Campbell, then of the Royal Engineers, in 1843. His pro-
posal and map were in all essential points identical with those more recently pro-
posed by the great engineer. Sir R. Macdonald Stevenson. These and many other
subsequent proposals, both French and English, have all now become merged in the
company of which Mr. Andrews is Chairman, and Sir John MacNeill, a man well-
known among you, Engineer-in-Chief. I was induced last year to proceed to Con-
stantinople to obtain the Sultan's firman, and make all preliminary arrangements
for the proposed line to India ; and I afterwards proceeded, accompanied by Sir John

MacNeill, C.E., and two assistant engineers, to examine carefully the coast of Asia-

Minor, where the Taurus touches the sea, in the hope of finding a practicable valley
for a future line through that country, and then proceeded to examine the coast for
a good harbour. That of Alexandretta did not promise to answer, on account of its
mountains, impassable for a railway ; and the ancient harbour of Seleucia was also
condemned as not affording sufficient depth of water. But on the southern side of
the Bay of Antioch, a spot was selected by Sir John MacNeill admirably adapted to
form a safe and commodious harbour of refuge. It will be capable of receiving
second-rate line-of-battle ships, and will be as good as, or superior to, the harbour
of Kingstown. The spot chosen is three miles south of the river Orontes, and six
miles east of the old harbour of Seleucia. The harbour is proposed to be formed by
running out a breakwater on the south side of the small natural harbour, which is a
perfectly safe and secure landing-place for boats, with good holding-ground ; so that
vessels taking out materials for the construction of the railway could anchor in safety
oflF this landing-place. Stone of the finest quality abounds close to the point where
the breakwater will abut on the land, and can be quarried also to any extent in the
immediate neighbourhood. It is proposed to construct about 1000 feet of the break-
water in the first instance, and to complete each portion as the work advances, so as
to afford shelter and landing wharfs within the first year or eighteen months, which
will enable vessels drawing 20 feet of water to lie in safety during the winter months,
if required to do so ; and within six months from the commencement of the work a
landing-place can be formed, and perfect shelter for boats, at an expense of £20,000.
The harbour, when completed, will be capable of giving shelter to thirty or

thirty-five vessels. The average depth of water will be from 20 to 40 feet. Our

survey of the country and the subsequent trial sections of the engineers, extended
from the coast to within sight of the Euphrates, taking in the towns of Antioch and
Aleppo. Beyond the latter, all engineering difficulties cease, the country presenting

--a hard dry level surface (called in Arabic " Ka Jalide," flat and hard), most admi-

rably adapted for a railway. And even between the Mediterranean and Aleppo the
difficulties are such as would be considered small in this country. There will not be
a single tunnel, and only two cuttings of any consequence. Two chain bridges over
the Orontes will be necessary ; but neither do these present any obstacle to the
engineering science of the present day. The estimated expense of the whole line is

£6,000,000.
    It is impossible to over-estimate the political and commercial advantages which

England would derive from the opening up of this most fertile country. History

proves what a powerful influence has at all times belonged to the possession of the

Valley of the Euphrates ; and to science, to the geologist, the naturalist, the ethno-
logist and the archaeologist, fresh and most interesting fields of inquirj' would be
opened by this line of communication with India. The difiSculties of dealing with

the Arabs have been much exaggerated. They are a singular people, combining

the extremes of good and evil in their character. But with good faith on our part,
judicious management, and a little foresight, there would be little to apprehend from

them. The chief difiiculties in dealing satisfactorily with the Arabs would arise from
their ignorance, the hostile state of their tribes, and their blood feuds. But I know
--126 REPORT 1857.

from experience, that by moderatioD, tact, and truthfulness on our part, these may

 be overcome.

    With regard to a telegraphic communication with India by this route, two lines
 have been proposed ; the one along the Red Sea to Kurrachee, the other along the
 Valley of the Euphrates to the same part. Both would seem to be most desirable,
 if not necessary. To effect this a submarine cable should be laid down from Kur-
 rachee to Ras-el-Had, or some other place near the entrance of the Persian Gulf.
Thence the proposed respective companies could carry their lines to England, the one
by way of Suez, and the other by the Persian Gulf. The Red Sea line, by following
Arabia, at a short distance from the coast, would encounter depths varying from
 20 to 100 fathoms nearly the whole way to Suez ; coral rocks are only occasionally
met with, and we should have the advantage of knowing where an accident might
occur, and prepare the means in consequence of recovering and repairing the broken
 pieces of the cable : so that the completion of the line from Ras-el-Had to Suez
does not seem to offer any practical diflSculty. For the other line, there is a choice
of two routes across Asia Minor from Constantinople, as far as Aleppo by one line,
and as far as Dyarbekir by the other : no difficulties whatever exist. But beyond
these places the Arabs are to be taken into account, but this is only for a limited
distance. The Une of the railway would ultimately be the preferable one, but for
immediate operation the other might be somewhat quicker. The work might there-

fore be commenced simultaneously at each extremity. A submarine cable could be

laid down from Ras-el-Had to Kuruah, and from the latter place to Bagdad, along
the bed of the Tigris ; and again between Constantinople and Dyarbekir, beginning
at several places at once in each part of these lines. The middle part only would be
wanting from Dyarbekir to Bagdad, and this might be completed by a line of Tartars;
and thus we should very soon be in possession of two lines of electric wires to India.

   The line of communication with India proposed by the French, would traverse
Asia Minor more to the northward than that which I have advocated, so as to come
into this line towards the head of the Euphrates. Unlimited funds might, doubt-

less, accomplish this, but my local knowledge gives me the firm belief that the Taurus

can only be passed, without an absolutely ruinous expense, in the direction of Adaua
and the Orontes. The French have long seen the importance of the Valley of the
Euphrates. They seem to know and feel, as the great Oriental scholar Dr. Sprenger
has said, " that its possessor holds the key of the Eastern world." It is, in fact, a
country far richer and more valuable than Egypt, and England, therefore, has now
at her feet the opportunity of acquiring the means of greatly increasing her com-
merce, of consolidating Turkey, and of securing our Indian territory both from in-
ternal and external dangers and the proposed railway would be the means of repay-

                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

to us originally from thence.

           On Australian Crania. By Professor J. H. Corbett.

   Professor J. H. Corbett exhibited crania, which had been selected by the late Dr.
John A. Corbett, R.N., in the neighbourhood of Port Essington, North Australia,
as affording characteristic examples of the heads of the Aborigines of that country.

   The texture of the cranial and facial bones is strong and compact. The superior max-
illary bones exhibit the prognathous tendency in a marked degree. The frontal region
may be described as receding, but by no means deficient in height; the temporal
regions are much flattened ; the perpendicular measurement of head from the mar-
gin of the foramen magnum to the vertex is equal with European heads ; the antero-
posterior measurement of the cranium is somewhat from half to three quarters of an
inch greater than that presented by many European skulls. The internal capacity
of these crania was found to be exactly the same as that of several European crania
of average size, which had been examined ; the method adopted for this purpose
being that of sealing up the several apertures, and then filling the head with fine sand
introduced through the foramen magnum. This mode of examination tends to show,
that the Australiem crania are capable of lodging an amount of cerebral matter just
equal to that of many European skulls, although the form of the brain must be

necessarily modified and moulded in adaptation with the cranial conformation. In

mthese heads, the cerebellar compartment is not in the least degree larger than

European crania.

On the Character, Extent, and Ethnological Value of the Indo-European

  Element in the Language of Finland. By Richard Cull, F.S.A.

   The author stated that his would differ from the ordinary form in which papers
and communications are presented to the Section. The shortness of time allowed
for each paper, the difficulty and extent of the inquiry, and the inability of phi-
lological papers to arrest the continuous attention of a mixed audience, induced him
to describe simply the method of his investigation, to read portions of two chapters
of his forthcoming work on the Finn language, to state some consequences which
result from the discovery of the great relationship of the Finn language, and to offer

a few remarks in conclusion.
   The existence of Greek and Latin words in the Finn language was pointed out by

Juslenius in I7l2 ; and Palmroth had previously, in 1685, called attention to certam

Greek words in the language. Professor Key drew attention to the subject in 1846,
in a short notice of the ' Grammatica Lapponica' by Fiellstrom, Stockholm, 1738, and
the ' Grammatica Finnica' by Vhael, Abo, 1733, in a paper entitled " The Lapp and
Finn tongues not unconnected with the Indo-European Family. By T. Hewitt

Key, A.M.*" Mr. Wedgwood has since drawn attention to the subject by pointing
out a number of words which he deems to have miscellaneous affinities with many

of the Indo-European languagesf- Their views, however, are not generally accepted.
   The base or root of most Finn words is bisyllabic. The syllables commonly begin

with a consonant and end with a vowel : some syllables, however, end with a con-

sonant, of which the most common are k, I, m, n, s and t, but n, s and t are the only
Aconsonants found at the end of words.
                                           few syllables occur with two final con-

sonants, and some with two initial consonants ; but these are in recently imported

words of Swedish origin and chiefly Biblical proper names.

The Swedish words which have been incorporated in the Finn language have

either naturally, or by artificial means, the peculiarities which characterize Finn

words, as in the following examples :

   The above selected examples are sufficient to indicate the nature of the modifica-
tions which Swedish words have suffered on their incorporation in the Finn lan-
guage. The author has collected and classified every Swedish woi-d in the Finn

language under three general heads, viz. («) unchanged, (jS) changed, and (y)
^greatly changed in form . The several means adopted to bring Swedish words to the
Finn form were briefly described.

and others equally like, suggested a careful study of Finn words in relation to those
of the Indo-European languages. The result of this comparison was the discovery
of a large number of Indo-European roots which appear to have suffered modifica-
tions precisely similar to those which the Swedish words have undergone. The fol-
lowing specimens are sufficient to indicate the nature of this discovery :

   The long lists of words from which the above selected vocabulary is taken are too
numerous and regular to be examples of mere accidental coincidence. They are
words, too, that form the basis or groundwork of speech, and not such words as are
commonly imported from one language to another by the fortune of war, or by the
peaceful intercourse of commerce. Hence it is impossible to escape the conclusion,
that the Indo-European element of the Finn language is an essential fundamental
element pervading the Finn language ; and being so, the Finn language must be
grouped as a member of the Indo-European family of languages. This philological
result is of ethnological value ; for as we are justified in assuming that peoples
speaking languages of a common origin have themselves a common origin, we are
bound to assume the Finns to be of the same origin as the rest of the Indo-European
nations. And all the Finnic tongues, as the Hungarian, the Lapponic, the Estho-
nian, and those of the isolated tribes in the Russian Empire, as the Karelian, the
Cheremissian, the Sirjanian, &c., must with the peoples speaking them be admitted

into the Indo-European family of tongues and peoples.

   There is no time even to state the consequences of this admission, but the close
connexion of the Turanian and Indo-European families of languages by means of

the Finnic dialects is too important not to be named.

On China^ in more immediate reference to pending Operations in that
     Quarter. By Sir John F. Davis, Bart., K.C.B., F.R.S.

The paper, after some general remarks on the interest of the subject at the present

moment, enters into a running but graphic description of the coast of Canton river,

Chusan, Shanghai, &c., showing the facilities which in many places they afford for

defence, and for annoying the hostile fleet, but at the same time the facility with

--which any such annoyance on the part of the Chinese could be overcome. With

respect to Canton, Sir John says, " It seems at once good policy as regards the

Cantonese, and mere justice and humanity towards the better-disposed populations

towards the north-east, that, if a lesson is to be administered, it should be adminis-

tered in the right quarter. Topical evils require topical remedies, and if we were

once more to leave Canton to itself (as we have done before), the question would

Whyagain be asked, which was so often asked then, '  did you not address yourselves

to those who had offended you, and were prepared to resist you, instead of attacking

us?' At Canton, besides, there is nothing at present to lose, for all trade has left

it, and all the foreign quarter is in ruins. The complete capture and occupation of

the city, and the heights behind, by our troops, with Hong-Kong and its harbour, its

barracks and its hospitals, for the base of operations, would at once dispel the delu-

sions of the Cantonese, and supply us with a material guarantee and pledge, as long

as it was retained, for all that we have to require from the Pekin Government.

These two points seem to comprise within themselves the objects of the expedition,
that is to say, satisfaction for the past and security for the future; and as the
surest way to the second, the first seems indispensable, viz. the capture and occu-

pation of the provincial city."

       071 the Physical Characteristics of the Ancient Irish.

                   By John O'Donovan, LL.D.

The author argued at full length to prove that the ancient Irish were a large race

of men, warlike and vigorous, from the poet Claudian and the Christian father St.

Jerome, the latter of whom describes a Scot from the neighbourhood of Britain, as

" canem grandem et corpulenturn, et qui calcibus magis possit sccvire quam dentihus."

Passing over many fabulous accounts of the gigantic size of the ancient Irish, he

dwelt with particular emphasis upon the description of the stature and personal

appearance of the Irish people given by Giraldus Cambrensis in 1183, before they

had received any admixture of Saxon or Anglo-Norman blood. In his 'Topographia

Hibernise,' Dist. i. c. 19, Giraldus says that all the animals in Ireland were smaller

than those he had seen in other countries, except man, " who alone retained his

majesty of stature ;" and in Dist. iii. c. x., where he says that (although the Irish

were no adepts in the science of nursing) their children nevertheless grew up by

--nature to be of beautiful, tall, and strong persons of well-formed and well-coloured

faces ; "Tanquam itaque Natura probans quid per se valeat fingere, non cessat et

figurare quousque in robur perfectum, pulcherrimis et proceris corporibus, et colo-
ratissimis vultibus, homines istos provehat et producat."

              On the Intellectual Characteristics of the Ancient Irish.
                         By JoHK ODoNovAX, LL.D.

   The author laid particular stress upon a passage in Bede's ' Ecclesiastical History,'
lib. iii. c. 7, to prove their love of learning and their wish to impart it to the Saxons,
while their neighbours the Cymri or Welsh people were unwilling to communicate
any literary or religious instruction to the Saxons. He nest glanced over the history
of various Irishmen who distinguished themselves on the Continent by their learning,
as Columbanus of Bobbio, St. Fursey of Peronne, St. Fridolin, St. Gall, Virgilius,
Solivagus the Geometrician ; Alcuin, Dungal, Joannes Scotus Erigena ; whose learn-
ing and scepticism were most remarkable for the age in which he flourisbed ; Mari-
anus Scotus, &c.

On the Surnames of the Irish People, their Meanings, and the various changes
^ which they have undergone since the English Invasion of Ireland. By

   John O'Donovan, LL.D.

   On this subject, to which he had devoted much time and study, the author in-

tended to publish a dictionary of Irish surnames, in which he would give thehistorr,
location, and census of all the families of Irish and Anglo-Irish descent now in Ire-
land, with references to all the ancient Irish and Anglo-Irish documents and records,
in which the origins and particular histories of these families are to be found, and to
the churches in which they have been interred.

On the Probable Migrations and Variations of the Earlier Families of the
          Human Bace. By Rear- Admiral FitzRoy, F.R.S.

In one of the first places which the author visited on the opposite side of the

world, he found no fewer than twenty-eight varieties of man. They were all di-

stinct, known by different names, and classified by no less an authority than Hum-

boldt. It was the cit)- of Lima, in Peru ; where one now may watch the colour,

features, and form of almost every variety in the world. He was greatly struck by

Wethis aggregation of colovirs and appearances.  all know that in Lima 400 years

since, there were only three distinct varieties ; 500 years ago there was but one race

(apparently) in Lima, the aboriginal Peruvian ; next the Spaniards (or Whites)
came, and with them Negroes from Africa : from which three sources have sprung

in the short space of 300 years all those varieties which Eire now so distinctly marked.

In some parts of India, also, there are numerous races, and in the Mauritius there

are likewise many varieties.

It is desirable to keep in mind three particular epochs in the world's historj',

namely,

1st. The commencement of this century.

2ndly. About 3000 years ago ; and
3rdly. The earliest dispersion of the human race.

First, as to the world's population at the beginning of this century. 'At that time

there were in existence in Van Diemen's Land, a few remnants of an aboriginal race,

which have since vanished. There were in Africa the genuine black roan, the brown

Moor or Berber; the red man, or CaflFre; the Hottentot, jmd the Bushman. The
latter are frequently regarded as degenerated varieties, but those who have seen the
interior of that country know that they cannot be so classed. In Americaj from

--Cape Horn to the Arctic Circle, we then found the same race of men the same

colour and hair. Having (twenty-five years ago) brought home four natives of
Tierra del Fuego, who remained with him for three years, the author was natu-
rally much struck on seeing an Esquimaux brought to England by Captain Ommaney,
precisely like the Fuegians in all respects ; and as we know the habits of those

who wander in canoes along the South American and the North American coasts
          TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                          131

are similar, this would seem to show that the original stock was the same. From
this and other facts, the author thinks that all the tribes of America are of one

aboriginal race, except those of Eastern Patagonia.
    In Asia the inhabitants of the Northern and Eastern parts are generally of a yel-

lower hue, but do not differ much in feature from the Americans. In the west of
America, the natives look to the West as the place from which they came, and bury
their dead towards the West (placing them " towards the spirits of their ancestors,"

as they say) ; while the natives of the east coast of Patagonia point to the east-
ward as the quarter whence they came, and they bury their dead on the highest hills
to the eastward for a similar reason. It is remarkable that none of them derive their
origin from their present localities in America. In Africa the natives point to the
North as the place of their origin ; and, briefly, all aboriginal tribes have been found
by travellers and the learned to derive their origin more or less directly from the

central regions of Asia.

HowIt may be asked.       could they have migrated so far in those early days ?  Land

travelling probably was not difficult, however slow, while the power of crossing the

sea in early times is not perhaps sufficiently appreciated in general. The double

canoe of the South Sea or Polynesian Islands is not commonly known, and is nearly

extinct as it formerly existed.

   It was one of the most sea-worthy vessels that could have been devised in those

primitive limes, and in such vessels families could have migrated not only along
coasts, but across oceans ; where no doubt they were liable to be driven far away

from their intended destination by unexpected winds, and perhaps currents. Such
casualties may have been the cause of early cannibalism.

   Regarding the possible connexion of those who migrated from Asia (the Tartar
and Malay race) with the tribes of the west coast of America, independently of
intercourse by Behring's Strait, the author remarks that if Malays were driven into

-- --the winds which always blow westward anti-trades or moonsoons they must go

towards the coast of America, which we know has happened within the last few
centuries, and would account for their derivation of origin from Asia.

   The habits and appearance of the Aborigines of Chiloe and Western Patagonia

correspond with many of the New Zealander's peculiarities. The black races of

Polynesia are a mixed breed, between the genuine Negro and the reddish-brown
man, or Malay.

   On one little island of the Indian Ocean (the Keeling or Cocos), an Englishman

was found married to a mixed or half-breed Malay. Their children were of a rich

bright red copper colour. Some children of Englishmen and native New Zealand
women were not of that colour in the first generation, but were so in the second.

--Of this the author can bear ocular testimony. The result of the whole inquiry is

thus expressed : " To reduce races to their original or primitive number, we can
only reach to the white and the black by tracing back the intermixtures." The
author concludes by referring to some passages of the Scriptures which bear on this

subject.

Oil some Skulls discovered in an ancient Sepulchral Mound near Mount

On the Progress already made in the Traiiscripiion and Translation of the
   Ancient Laws of Ireland, called the JBrehon Laws. By the Rev. Professor

   Graves,

   The author referred to the array of quarto MS. volumes on the table before him,
as evidence of the amount of work that had been already accomplished. The first
thing done, after ascertaining all the MSS. of those laws that were to be found in
the libraries of Trinity College, the Royal Irish Academy, the British Museum, and
the Bodleian Library, was to entrust the transcription to Dr. O'Donovan and Mr.
Curry. This was commenced in 1853 ; and at the present time about six thousand

quarto pages of manuscript had been transcribed, and about two thousand pages had
been translated. The transcript had been executed in anastatic ink, which enabled

--them to make several copies, one great advantage of which was that they had been

                                                                                              9*

able readily to compile a vast glossary of the words used in the laws, with all the

quotations to illustrate their meaning, arranged alphabetically. He had to mention,
as an interesting fact, that Mr. Curry had been enabled, by this glossary, to inves-
tigate some of the legal terms in the ancient Welsh laws, which the Welsh transla-
tors had been unable fully to explain. The language of these manuscripts was very
ancient, and the writing was in many places scarcely legible : hence it was impos-
sible to estimate the amount of labour and of eyesight expended on them. This great
work, however, was worth all the labour devoted to it. It was a most important con-
tribution to our history, for nothing better explained the history and manners of a
people than their laws and institutions. They throw a light even upon the history
of other countries. The glossary which they had formed would be of the utmost
value for the knowledge of the Celtic languages ; and he had no doubt that the Bre-
hon Laws would present to us a picture of the civilization of this country as it existed
from twelve to fifteen hundred years ago. W^hat length of time would be requisite,
he might be asked, until this work would be completed? He had already told them
what had been done in the last four years, and if it took as much more it would be
worth the expense. He was happy to inform them that there was no fear that the
work would be left unfinished. At the close of the late session of Parliament the
 Government had provided ample means for completing and publishing it.

    The Rev. Professor Giiaves made a communication, the object of which was to
 identify the river Dur, mentioned by Ptolemy in his description of Ireland, with the
 Kenmare river. The principal argument by which Dr. Graves endeavoured to esta-
 blish this conclusion, rests on the fact that at the mouth of the Kenmare river is an
 island retaining to this day the name of Dursey. The obvious and certain deriva-
 tion of this name is Durs-ey, i. e. the " Island of Dur," "Dur" meaning woier.
 Dr. Graves noticed that the termination "ey," meaning island, entered into the
 names of Dalkey, Ireland's Eye, and Lambay, on the Irish coast, not to mention
 Anglesey and other islands on the coast of Britain. The order in which Ptolemy
 enumerates the principal headlands, rivers, and maritime towns of Ireland also
 shows that the river which he calls the Dur is on our southwest coast. Ware and
 O'Connor have expressed the opinion that the Dur of Ptolemy was Dingle Bay, or
 Castlemaine Bay, but they have stated no grounds for their belief. Dr. Graves con-
 cluded by observing that the Irish topographical names appearing in Ptolemy's list
 deserve a more complete discussion than they have yet received.

             0?i the Influence of the Gulf-stream on the Climate of Ireland.

                   By Professor Hennessy, F.R.S., M.R.I.A.

    By referring to a large map of the British Isles*, the isothermal lines, or lines indi-
 cating the distribution of equal temperature, were shown to run not even approxi-

 mately in the direction of the parallels of latitude, as might be expected, but in
 curves almost concentric, and following very nearly the windings of the coast. These
 relations to the coast line illustrated a fact first pointed out by Dr. Lloyd, President
 of the Association, which was deduced from a series of both day and night observa-
 tions, namely, that the mean temperature of the sea off the west coast of Ireland is
 four degrees higher than the main temperature of the land. All these facts are easily

 explained by the phenomenon of the Gulf-stream, or warm current of water, which,
 as is well known to navigators, flows from the Gulf of Mexico in the direction of
 those islands and the north-west coast of Europe. That current of water, heated
 in the warm regions where it commences, exercises its influence very sensibly on the
 atmosphere, raising its temperature, and charging it with vapours, which are known
 to give out a certain amount of heat during their subsequent precipitation. From
 Dr. Wilde's historical ' Report on the Diseases and Cosmical Phenomena of Ireland,'

On the Round Towers of Ireland. By Gordon M. Hills.

   The author exhibited drawings, forty-four in number, illustrating forty of the
round towers, being the first portion of a survey still in progress, which is intended
to include drawings of every round tower in existence, with the architectural features
of each shown at large, and the dimensions taken either by actual measurement or
by the sextant and artificial horizon. The survey extends to the churches and build-
ings adjacent to, or in connexion with the round towers ; and in addition, to the
sites and buildings where there is authority for believing that round towers have

existed.

  An abstract of the particulars given of the first portion of the survey is as follows;

On the relation between the newly-discovered Accadian Langv/ige and the
   Indo- European, Semitic, and Egyptian Languages ; with remarhs on the

   original values of certain Semitic Letters, and on the state of tlw Greek

   Alphabet at different periods. By the Rev. E. Hincks, LL.D.

   The facts from which the author proposed to reason relate to the language of the
Assyrians, the mode of writing of the Assyrians, and the language of the people who
invented this mode of writing, or, as they have been called, the Accadians. The
Assyrian language is a member of the family which has been generally called Semitic.
This term may be retained, as no preferable term presents itself; but is objection-
able, as we have no reason to suppose that the divisions of mankind with respect to
language and with respect to descent were coincident. All the Semitic languages
that were known before the discovery of the Assyrian agree with one another in
some important particulars in which they differ from the Assyrian. For example,

Hthey have in the separate pronouns and affixes of the third person, and in the

preformative of causative verbs ; while the Assyrian has S. They may be classed

together as the Syro-Arabian sub-family of the Semitic family of languages ; the

Assyrio-Babylonian being its other sub- family.
   The grand distinctive feature of the Semitic languages is that in them the roots

are consonantal. Most commonly, they consist of three consonants, or what are
considered as such ; but in no instance does a vowel form part of the root. The
vowels are used to determine the grammatical forms, which they sometimes do alone,
but oftener with the assistance of consonants, prefixed or suffixed to those of the
root or inserted among them. In all other languages, on the contrary, the roots are
syllabic ; though in many languages the vowels are liable to be changed in certain

Wgrammatical forms, and consonants may be inserted within the roots. Besides the

ordinary consonants, the semi-vowels and Y, and certain breathings, there are
combinations of consonantal sounds, which are treated in Semitic grammar as simple

consonants.

  Now this distinctive feature of Semitic language, that its roots are consonantal, con-

nects itself naturally with a distinctive feature of Semitic writing. It is consonantal.
Its characters represent those consonants, or what were considered as such, which
are capable of being elements of roots. It has, properly speaking, no vowels. In

Hebrew, as it is now printed, there are points attached to the letters, which indicate
the vowels with which these letters are to be sounded ; but it is generally admitted
that these points were no part of the original text. There are also some letters,
which in certain cases supply the place of vowels when the points are not written.

TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  135

UThe most common of these are Faw and Yod, which express the vowels and I, as

Wwell as the semi-vowels and Y. There can scarcely be a doubt, however, that in

some cases where these letters are now read as vowels, they were originally read as
semivowels ; the 6th of the feminine plural was originally dwath ; the t of the affix
" my " was originally ya. In other cases, these vowel letters were inserted by

copyists at a comparatively recent period ; according to Dr. Wall, in the second
century after Christ. In the oldest Phoenician inscription extant, that on the sar-
cophagus of Asmunezer, there are no vowel letters. The Yod of the plural number

is never written in either the absolute or the constant form ; there is no Vaw at the

end of the third person plural, and no letter after Zayin in the demonstrative pronoun.

   All the Semitic languages with which we were acquainted previously to the deci-

phering of the Assyrio-Babylonian inscriptions were originally written from right to
left, and with consonants only ; and no languages other than Semitic ones were thus
written, except under Semitic influence. It was therefore a natural supposition
that the cuneiform writing of Babylon, where a Semitic language was believed to have
been spoken, would be written with characters which represented the Semitic conso-

nants. Two circumstances might have suggested doubts as to this being the case

the writing was directed from left to right, and the characters were far more nume-
rous than in the Semitic alphabet ; but notwithstanding these objections, all who
undertook the decipherment of the inscriptions before 1847, with the single excep-
tion of Grotefend, referred the characters to the Semitic alphabet. The explanation
which they gave of the large number of the characters was that each letter was repre-
sented by several equivalent characters ; and that some characters represented com-
binations of letters, Aleph, Faw, and Yod being accounted vowels. Grotefend denied
the equivalence of any two characters, and supposed that characters might represent

consonants, combinations of consonants, vowels or syllables. Grotefend identified the
Babylonian groups which represented the names of Darius, Hystaspes, and Xerxes

and his analysis of these names might pass if no other words were to be considered
and so indeed might that of the other decipherers ; but both these systems failed when
the values of the characters used in these words were transferred to other words in
which the characters occurred. In the latter end of 1847. it occurred to the author

of this paper that the characters must represent definite syllables, no character re-

presenting a detached consonant, and no vowel being left unexpressed. He consi-

dered that the Assyrians did not analyse their words beyond syllables ; they did not

recognize consonants or vowels as constituents of syllables ; their characters repre-
sented simple syllables or combinations of syllables ; not Semitic letters or combi-
nations of them, as the French decipherers and Sir H. Rawlinson supposed, nor
European letters and combinations of them, as Grotefend thought. These three

modes of analysing the names of Darius and Hystaspes were represented in fig. 1
of a lithographed plate, which was distributed in the Section (Plate III.). It was
observed that, so far as respected these two names, the difference between these dif-
ferent modes might appear unimportant ; but the problem to be solved was to analyse
these names in such a manner as that the values of the characters deduced from these
and other like names, when substituted in Assyrian nouns and verbs, would enable
us to exhibit them in Semitic forms. The first two modes of analysis failed to do
this, but the third effected it. In a lithographed plate, which was exhibited at the

Edinburgh Meeting of the British Association in 18.50, and which was pubUshed in

the Report for that year, there were a number of groups of cuneatic characters,
which were read syllabically as Semitic words. Though there were errors in most

of these words, which have since been corrected by the author himself or by others,

they were such close approximations to the true reading of the words, that they could

scarcely fail to carry conviction to those who were studying the inscriptions. The
syllabic system of deciphering, which had previously been maintained by the author
alone, is now universally adopted.

   This, then, being a settled point, it comes to be inquired, how came the Assyrians
to write on a totally different system from what all other Semitic people used ? The

answer to this question given by the author in 1850 was, that the Assyrians learned

their system of writing from a non-Semitic people. He then thought that this other
people had partially adopted the Egyptian system of writing ; but he was now satis-
fied that they had invented it independently of the Egyptians. What suggested to
--!36 REPORT 1857.

him that the inventors of cuneatic writing were acquainted with hieroglyphic writing,

was that ideographic characters were mixed with i)honetic ones in botli the systems.

This alone, however, would not prove that this was the case ; for ideographic cha-
racters are mixed with phonetic ones in almost all systems. The Arabic and Roman

numerals, the signs for degrees, minutes and seconds, and for the diiferent denomi-

nations of money and the like, are ideographic. These have not been borrowed from

either the Assyrian or the Egyptian system ; why then should it be tliought that one of
these was borrowed from the other? Unless the ideographs were introduced among the

phonographs in a strikingly similar manner in the two systems, it would by no means

follow that one system was taken from the other. The author, however, denied that

they were introduced in a similar manner. The Egyptians sometimes wrote the name

of an object phonetically, and added the figure or symbol of the object ; but the

Assyrians never did so. They wrote down the word or they wrote down the sign
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

but they never wrote down both, one after the other. At other times, the Egyptians

wrote the name of an object phonetically, and wrote after it the ideograph, not of

the object, but of the species or genus to which it belonged. The Assyrians did

something like this, but not this. They prefixed the ideographic sign of the species

to the name of the individual, or that of the genus to the name of the species. They

prefixed what the Egyptians postfixed. Surely, if they had learned the use of deter-

minative signs from the Egyptians, they would have used them as the Egyptians did.

Again, compound ideographs are used in Egyptian writing ; but though there appear

to be instances of the use of them in Assyrian writing, these are capable of a difl^er-

ent explanation, which is probably the true one. In fig. 2, we have a combination

of two characters, which signifies "a. son;" the characters signifying severally

"child" and "male." Sir Henry Rawlinson has, however, suggested that these

characters, which have the phonetic values iur and us, represent words of the Acca-

dian language to which the cuneatic writing was first applied. These Accadian

words, when alone, are interchanged with the equivalent Assyrian words which are

beneath them in the figure, being written when those Assyrian words should be

read ; and in like manner the compound Accadian word Tur-us, "a male child," is

written when the equivalent Assyrian word pal should be read. This Accadian

compound is interchanged with a simple Accadian word for " son," which was pro-

Abably pronounced hivah ; both Accadian forms being equally read as pal.  great

deal of the supposed ideographic writing of the Assyrians is thus, in fact, a writing

down of Accadian words, when the equivalent Assyrian words are to be read ; a
mode of proceeding which was certainly not learned from the Egyptians, who prac-

tised nothing at all like it. Strange as this mode of proceeding must appear, and as

it certainly is, it has some resemblance to what occurs in English. Abbreviations

are frequently used, which represent Latin words, and which ore nevertheless read

by English words. Thus "A!" represents " lihros," but is read " pounds ;" " e. g."
represents " exempli gratia," but is read " for example." It thus appears that so

far as respects their use of ideographs, there is very little resemblance between the

Assyrian and Egyptian systems of writing ; certainly not enough to require us to

attribute to them a common origin. Let us now look to the forms and values of the

characters. In both systems we have representations of "the mouth" and of
" water ;" but they are as unlike as it would be possible to make them (see fig. 3).

The Egyptians represented the mouth as seen in front, the Assyrians as seen from

the side; the wedges represent the lips, the line of the face, and the mouth itself.

The Assyrians represented water by drops of rain ; the Egyptians by the waved sur-

face of standing water. Sui-ely there would not have been such differences if one

system had been taken from the other. Again, the Egyptian characters for the most

part represented incomplete syllables, requiring vowels to be supplied which were

not expressed ; whereas the Assyrian characters all represented complete or definite

syllables, in which no vowels had to be supplied. The Egyptian syllabic characters

differed in another respect from the Assyrian ones. They admitted complementary

letters, as they are called ; sometimes before them, sometimes after them, and some-
times both before and after them ; while the Assyrian characters had no comple-
ments. To show the nature of the complementary characters of the Egyptians, and

at the same time the uncertainty of their writing, owing to the absence of vowels,

two syllabic characters are given in figures 4 and 5, with the variations of which the

writing of them admits, and with the equivalent Hebrew and Roman characters.

The first character in fig. 4 represents Alej^h, Mem, ; and by the aid of the Leaf, Aleph,
and the Owl, Mem, we have four modes of writing the syllable equivalent to the

simple syllabic character. None, however, of the five modes of writing distinguishes

the vowel. All these modes are equivalent to a pair of Hebrew letters ; but they
represent three different combinations of Roman letters; to each of which a distinct

Assyrian character corresponds. In fig. 5 there is only one mode of completing the
syllable used. Two Egyptian ways of expressing Mem, Nun were in use ; and each

might represent three syllables, two of which had Assyrian characters to represent

them, while all three might be represented by combinations of two Assyrian charac-

ters, having the respective values of MA. AN, MI. IN and MU.UN. It appears,

then, that the values of Assyrian and Egyptian characters are not even of the same

kind. They could not be the same unless the value were a vowel; and in point of

fact they never are the same.

Dismissing then the idea that the Assyrian mode of writing was in any respect

derived from the Egyptians, we have to seek its origin in the lower part of the valley

of the Euphrates, where the clayey nature of the soil would account for the plastic

character of the writing. The name of Accad occurs in Gen. x. 10, as that of one

of the earliest cities in this district, and it is also found in the Assyrian inscriptions,

apparently applied to the whole district. It has therefore been chosen with great

propriety by Sir H. Rawlinson to represent the people who invented the Assyrian

mode of writing. The language of this people may be called Accadian ; and there

are in existence ample means of attaining to the knowledge of its structure and its

vocabulary. The sources of information respecting it are of three sorts. The bilin-
gual tablets in the British Museum were written in the seventh century b.c. Some

of these contain Accadian sentences and equivalent Assyrian sentences, either in

parallel columns, or one beneath the other. In others, sentences in the two lan-

guages are analysed, so as to give the precise meaning of every element in the long

Accadian words that we meet. In all the Assyrian inscriptions Accadian words are

occasionally introduced and when different copies of the inscriptions have been
                                                                                                                                                            ;

found, it often happens that one contains an Accadian word and another its Assyrian

equivalent. The oldest Assyrian inscription of considerable length is that of Tiglath

Pileser I., whose capital was sacked by the Accadians of Babylon 419 years before

the first year of Sennacherib (702 b.c). The inscription was therefore written a

little before 1121 b.c. Inscriptions, the language of which is wholly Accadian, and

which are anterior to the Assyrian ones, are said to be in existence ; but copies of

them have not yet been made public. A third source of information as to the glos-

sary of the Accadian language goes back to the origin of this species of writing. The

phonetic values of the characters used in the original writing of the Accadians were

Wethe names of the objects which the characters represented.                                 know what certain

characters represented, and we know their phonetic values ; and thus we come to

know the Accadian names of certain objects at the time when this mode of writing

Wewas invented.  cannot assign the date of this invention ; but we have a minor

limit for it. In the inscription of Tiglath Pileser I., who began to reign about

1130 B.C., mention is made of a temple, which after standing 641 years, having be-

come ruinous, had been taken down by the great-grandfather of this king, sixty years

before his accession. Sixty is a round number, but is more likely to have been less

than greater  than the  actual  number                                        but the other  number, which  purports to be
                                                                           ;

accurate, was doubtless taken from an authentic record. The temple would there-

fore have been built about 1830 b.c Now, Tiglath Pileser found inscriptions written

by its builder, who lived before the origin of the Assyrian monarch)' ; and we have

thus the 19th century b.c as the latest date at which the origin of Accadian writing

can be fixed. Its actual date was in all probability several generations earlier.

The bilingual tablets teach us that the Accadian language was in its structure as

dissimilar as can well be conceived possible both to the Indo-European languages

and to the Semitic ones. It had unmistakeable affinities with the language of the in-

scriptions found at Susa and in its neighbourhood, and with that of the Achsemenian

inscriptions of the second kind. These latter had been supposed by Mr. Norris to be

connected with the Ugrian languages ; while others believed them to be represented
by the Mongolian or Dravidian languages. The author, being unacquainted with
--138 REPORT 1857-

these languages, declined to express a positive opinion. As respected his arguments

in this paper, it was of no consequence whether the Accadian language was repre-

sented by one or more living languages, or whether it had died away, like the Egyp-

tian, leaving no representative on the tongues of men. He was inclined to think,

however, that all the Turanian languages were descended, if not from the Accadian,

from its parent the Japhetic, which is hereafter to be noticed ; though from the long

period which must have elapsed before these languages were reduced to writing, and

from the barbarism and nomadic habits of most of the nations who spoke them,

there can be little hope of the descent being traced in a satisfactory manner. It had

been noticed, several years ago, that the Egyptian language was connected with the

Semitic languages in respect to its glossary. The connexion was so manifest, that,

notwithstanding the structural difference of the languages, Bunsen and others have

Aclassed the Egyptian among the Semitic languages.  glossarial resemblance

between the Indo-European languages and either the Semitic or the Egyptian had

also been remarked in some words. In the present paper, the author endeavours

to establish this glossarial affinity between the three languages or families of lan-

guages that have been named, and the Accadian. The latter he regards as more

closely connected with the Indo-European languages than with the other two.

He supposes it to be a sister language to the primitive Indo-European lan-

guage, from which all the existing languages of this stock are descended; and

he supposes that the common parent of these two (and possibly of other Turanian

languages), which he calls the Japhetic language, was a sister to the Semitic

and Egyptian languages. The linguistic pedigree, according to the author's view,

is found in fig. 6. It is inferred from a number of verbal pedigrees, such as that of

the second numeral in fig. 7, in which it is to be observed that each word in the

verbal pedigree is to be referred to that language, the name of which occupies a cor-

responding position in the linguistic pedigree. It is to be observed also that the

Egyptian and Accadian words are directly obtained from inscriptions ; but all the
other words in the pedigrees are obtained by inference from what is otherwise known.

The author's principle is, that when of the corresponding words in two sister lan-

guages, one is known, and a number of descendants of the other are also known,

this other may be in general inferred with certainty. His mode of proceeding is

illustrated by the numeral for "two." The Egyptian word is given in fig. 8. It

occurs. Select Papyri, pi. 27. 1. 11, where it follows the word nV> ^""^ implies that
it should be doubled. Elsewhere it is found doubled. The identity of the word in

both its forms is unquestionable from the peculiar monstrous bird which it signifies,

by a representation of which it is followed. The first character in the hieroglyphic
TH Wname might be read indifferently T,
Dor ; the others represent and Y, one of

which at least must be read as a vowel. The Egyptians introduced vowel letters

much earlier than the Phoenicians or Hebrews did ; and these last probably learned

the use of them from them. The Accadian word is used, like the Egyptian word,

to denote duplication. The plural of the word signifying a city is written, for

example, in three ways ; and it should be observed that the Accadian plural was

formed by doubling the singular. These are exhibited in fig. 9. The character is

doubled ; or the syllable mi is added ; or a character is added, which has been
called the plural sign. It is, however, composed of one of the forms for mi and

is; and in the Syllabary, K. 110, it is directed to be pronounced ww. It might

be argued, indeed, that the Accadian value of this word was rather "many"

than " twice ;" but the use of it in fig. 10 proves decisively that this was not

the case. Some preliminary explanation is, however, required before the force

of the argument drawn from this use of it can be seen. It has been stated that

Accadian words were used in Assyrian inscriptions, in place of Assyrian words.

When the words were verbs, it was customary to add to the Accadian verbal root

the termination of the Assyrian verb. Thus the Accadian root signifying " to go"

was (hi; and we have in the upper line of fig. 10 the equivalent forms (du) ku

and illiku, both of which are found written interchangeably, but the latter of which
was always read. The corresponding English verb would be " he has gone ;" the

final u not being a sign of the plural number, but of the preterperfect tense. In the

following line we have three forms used interchangeably, which represent the corre-
sponding frequentative verb ittalaku, " he has gone repeatedly." The Accadian

                                                                                       J
                                                                             ;

                TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                139

frequentative verb is formed by duplication ; it is du-du. This gives (du-du) Ttu,
analogous to (c^m) leu of the preceding line ; and for this we have, in the great in-

scription of Tiglath Pileser I. {du-mis) ku. In this instance, it is impossible to assign

any value to mis but "twice." The double Accadian formmi, mis, analogous to the

Sanskrit dvi, dvis, and to the similar forms in Greek and Latin, is one argument out

of many for the closer connexion of the Accadian with the Indo-European lan-

guages than with the Semitic and Egyptian languages. The form in i occurs in all
the languages ; the adverbial development in is is Japhetic, being common to both

the Accadian and the Indo-European languages; but the adjectival declension is

exclusively Indo-European.

Having obtained the Accadian form from the inscriptions, the author investigated

the other forms in the verbal pedigree by inference from this form and the Semitic

and Indo-European forms. There can be no question that the two last radicals of

the primitive Semitic root for "two" were J. Before these some languages had {Jf,

nand others ; the Arabs having their peculiar letter Tha. Again, there can be no

question that the primitive Indo-European form had v or w, preceded by a dental,

Now mbefore i.  is interchangeable both with its fellow-nasal n and with its cog-

nate labial v or w; whereas no direct interchange could exist between n and v or w.

mIt necessarily follows that the primeval form had before i ; and as a double change

in passing from the primeval to the primitive Semitic is not admissible, and as tm is

an unpronounceable combination, these two forms must have been ihmi and thni, the

th being pronounced as in "thin." The Japhetic form must have been i/imi, and
the primitive Indo-European thwi but in the last two words the th may have been

                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

sounded as in "thy ;" and probably was so, as it is represented by d in the great

majority of existing forms.

This may serve as a specimen of the manner in which verbal pedigrees have been

Aformed.  list is given further on of Accadian words with the primitive Indo-Euro-

pean and Japhetic words, to which they and the known Indo-European words that

correspond to them conduct us. It is necessary, however, to ascertain the original

values of certain Semitic letters which occur in the Accadian words. It will be seen

that the values which some of these letters had subsequently to the Babylonish cap-

tivity, were very different from what they had when the Accadian language was first

committed to writing.

In the Achsemenian inscriptions Samech has the value S, and Shin SH. The

Sibilant in the name of Darius and the former of those in that of Hystaspes, fig. 1,

SHare represented by Shin, and in the first kind of Persepolitan writing by  ; the

latter of the Sibilants in the name of Hystaspes is represented by Samech, and by S.
This is in conformity with received opinion ; but when we go back to the Assyrian
inscriptions, we find a very different state of things. There, in the Assyrian repre-

sentations of foreign proper names, the Hebrew Shin is represented by Samech
although in the roots which were common to the two languages Samech corresponds

to Samech, and Shin to Shin, no matter where the diacritical point of the Masoretes

be placed. This is invariably the case where the Shin precedes a vowel or an ordi-

nary consonant, or terminates a word. Where, however, it precedes Kaph or Qoph,

Shin and Samech seem to be used indiscriminately in Assyrian. To establish these

facts, from which he inferred that Shin was always pronounced by the Assyrians as

S, and that they used SK (which they represented by Samech) for the Hebrew SH,

the author exhibited the following transcriptions of Hebrew names, occurring in Assy-

rian inscriptions, with the vowels used by the Assyrians represented by points.

The Masoretic pointing of the Hebrew he thought it useless to set down.

n\DM
--140 REPORT 1857.

substituted Samech for the Sin that was originally written. That SK was the ori-

ginal value of Samech is confirmed by the value of the Greek letter, which corre-
sponds in figure and position to the latter ; which is KS, and which was originally
SK. It is also confirmed by the etymological relation of '\D> " a bowl," with (TKacprj,

and ^P, a " sword," with ^l(f)os. What the Ephraimites in Judges xii. 6 said, when

desired to say Shibboleth (which they, like the Assyrians, could not pronounce), must
have been Shibboleth. It is SK, and not S, that a person would naturally utter,
who was making an unsuccessful attempt to pronounce SH.

    Prior, however, to tlie twelfth century b.c, the date of the earliest existing

Assyrian inscriptions, Samech had acquired the secondary value of ST. In those

forms of Assyrian verbs where a T was introduced after the first radical, when the

first radical was Shin, Samech was used for the double letter.  Thus we have JD^V
                                                                                                                                           |

from \3^' representing astakan. Also when the afiixes of the third person, all of
which begin with S, were attached to nouns ending in T, we have Samech for the

ST, which, according to a well-known Semitic analogy, would be substituted forTS.

KThat is particularly liable to be replaced by T, which is easier to be pronounced,

appears from the languages of many Polynesian tribes, and from the first attempts

Kat speaking made by children among ourselves. The passage of into T appears in

the verbal pedigree of the pronoun of the second person (fig. 11). It is evident that

the T was derived from an original K in the three languages independently of one

another. In the Egyptian, T was substituted in the feminine gender, the original

harsher sound being retained for the masculine. In the Semitic languages, T was

Ksubstituted for in the independent pronoun, and in the preformatives and aflForm-

Katives of verbs,  being retained for the possessive and objective aflSxes. In the

KJaphetic languages has disappeared altogether, being everywhere replaced by a

dental. The values of Samech were, therefore, originally SK only ; from about the

13th century b.c, SK and ST, the latter gradually supplanting the other ; and from

the 6th century b.c, S.

Zayin expressed the sonant or softened sound corresponding to the second value

ZDof Samech, that is  ;  and from the 6th century b.c, Z.

Tsaddi expressed the strengthened sound corresponding to the above. After the

6th century b.c, it represented the Arabic Sad, and before that date, the combina-

tion of that letter with Teth.

Teth represented a strengthened TH. With the vowel a after it Teth is generally

confounded, in Assyrian writing, with Daleth ; and Tsaddi always with Zayin ; but
they are distinguished before the other vowels. Perhaps it may be fairly inferred

from this, that tha was pronounced as in that, but thi and thu as in thin and thumb;

always, however, with the peculiar Semitic strengthening of the consonant.

Qoph is another strengthened letter, bearing the same relation to Gimel and Kapk,

that Teth bears to Daleth and Tau.

Heth must also have been a strengthened letter, being frequently substituted for

Teth. It may be conjectured, but is scarcely capable of proof, that the letters to

which it was related were Ghayin, pronounced as in the name of Gaza, and He.

Aleph is usually considered to denote the simple commencement of utterance, or

the absence of any breathing or semivowel ; and this certainly seems to have been

its value in all the Assyrian inscriptions which are extant. If, however, we go back

to the infancy of language, we shall see reason to think that Aleph had once a posi-

tive value. It expresses the preformative of the first person singular ; sometimes

alone, and at other times with a vowel, which is evidently one of connexion. As T

Nrepresents the pronoun of the second person singular, and that of the first person

plural, so Aleph represents that of the first person singular; and this must have

been originally something substantial, not a mere negation as at present.

The character which represents the preformative with the vowel a as a link of

connexion, is that which as an ideograph denotes " water" (fig. 3). It represents

^other Hebrew letters as well as Aleph. In fig. 12 it has this value, that is ; but

in fig. 13 it represents Hi in figs. 14 and 15 *; and in fig. 15 it also represents 1.

It is probable that the Hebrew words in which it represents initial ya were originally
                                                                        TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                                                                              l4l

pronounced with wa. This seems evident in the case of |*> " wine," and of verbs

like ^tJ^*.                     It would appear then that the letter Aleph passed into He and Vaw
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

HW,and it is therefore natural to suppose that its original value was                                                                                                                    which would

Weasily do this. Indeed there is no sound which would be likely to be dropped that

Aleph could represent except this, H, and Y having other letters to represent them.

In confirmation of this, it is to be observed that mu is the pronominal root of the

first person in Accadian ; and the Indo-European objective me implies the existence

of a nominative mu, from which it would be derived as te from tu. The transition

of hw into m is exceedingly common : see the annexed Table. The Japhetic form

would then be hwu, the Semitic and Egyptian }ij or Ji{, the vowel being unsettled.

By adding ku, " here," to the primeval hwu, we have kwu-ku, changed for euphony
into hwdku or hwiku, "I here." This became the Indo-European iku, and with the

verb of presence hwan-hwdku, properly " adsum," and not used till a late period for
"ego."

   The character for "water" was in Accadian hwa generally used in the plural as
                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

hwa-hwa. These were Japhetic forms ; and from them we have the Indo-European
ahwa, and from the singular form ma, wa, wi, u, all of wliich are in use. The Semitic
mi and mami and the Egyptian mu are clearly connected with them.

   The following is a list of the verbal pedigrees, several of them imperfect, which
have been obtained by me. Of the numerals with which it begins, the Accadian
words for "three" and " four" are less to be depended on than the rest. It is sup-
posed that the second character in fig. 1 represents "a set of three," three bars or
other objects connected by a string; that the Accadian name of this was the phonetic
value of the character ri ; while the Semitic word corresponding to this, tal (whence
talit in the feminine), was a second phonetic value, as in fig. 10. The analogy of the
numeral for "two" favours this view. It is supposed again that a rhombus or four-
sided figure, of which the phonetic value was ut, represented the Accadian word for
"four," as four small horizontal wedges represented the corresponding Semitic
word. The equivalence in value of these characters seems probable, though it has
not been demonstrated. Here again the analogies of Nos. 11 and 12 corroborate the

pedigree.

 first on the list, and all those after the ninth have no representatives at all in
 Sanskrit ; and of the eight which have Sanskrit representatives, it is only in the case

 of the numerals for "two" and "three" that they come anything like as near to the

 primitive Indo-European forms as the Classical or Teutonic representatives of these
 words. It thus appears that, contrary to what has been generally thought of late

 years, eo far as the roots are concerned, the Greek, Latin and Teutonic forms ap-
 proach the nearest to the primitive forms ; while the Sanskrit deviates from them

 most.
     Even as respects the verbal terminations, where the Sanskrit is more to be de-

 pended on, it appears that Bopp has given more weight to its testimony than it
 deserves. He considers the ST of the second person, preserved in English and
 German to this day, and found also in the Latin and Armoric preterperfects, to con-
 tain an unorganic addition ; whereas it appears from what has been said that »« and
 st are the commencements of the primitive Indo-European pronouns of the first and
 second persons singular. It is now manifest that the original declension of the
 Latin present was reg-u-m, reg.i-st . . .reg-u-mus, reg-i-stis. The st was reduced to s
 in the singular and to t in the plural; just as in the separate pronoun it was reduced

 to s in Greek and to t in Latin.
    The increased value of the Greek and Latin forms given to them by this discovery

 renders it more than ever important to ascertain what they were in (he earliest
 periods. It is known that while the Greek which has come down to us is written with
an alphabet of twenty-four letters, the Greeks had at first only sixteen. It is there-
fore a question of great interest what these sixteen letters were ; and in connexion
with this it has to be considered how the Greeks originally wrote words which were
subsequently written with the newly introduced eight letters. That the Greeks
derived their letters from the Phcenicians is generally admitted ; and both the names
that are given to most of them and their forms prove that this is the case. The
vowels of the original alphabet were the three Semitic breathings, Aleph, He, and

WAyin. Vaw and Yod retained their original values, and represented the semivowels
     and Y. Of the remaining seventeen Semitic letters there were six which repre-
sented either combinations of consonants, or those strengthened consonants which
were peculiar to the Semitic languages. These six were rejected by the Greeks.
The remaining eleven with the three vowels and the two semivowels constituted the
original alphabet. These were the first twenty letters of the full alphabet, with the
exception of Z, H, and 3. An old Greek Scholiast expressly affirms that these
were the sixteen original or Cadmean letters ; and the fanciful theories of modern
writers in England and on the Continent, in opposition to this statement, are un-
worthy of the slightest attention. Two different sets of four letters were added to

the original sixteen in different parts of Greece. In certain districts the four excepted

letters given above were added ; butH was used as an aspirate, not as a long vowel.

HIn other districts was added as an aspirate, and along with it Q, *, and X as com-

pound aspirates. Prior to the introduction of H, its place was supplied by 2, which
was originally pronounced as a sibilant in the masculine article 20 and many other
words, and which afterwards retained its place in the word when an aspirate only
was sounded there. This was the 2av Ki^haXov of the fragment of Pindar. About

Hthe time when was introduced as an aspirate, the semivowels lost their original

values, except in the diphthongs ; and were used to express modifications of the ori-

ginal vowels E and O. The Jiolians retained the semivowel for W, as well as the
new vowel which the other Greeks substituted for it ; but neither this additional

letter nor the Koppa ever formed part of the regular Greek alphabet. At the time
when Z and S were first added to the alphabet, which must have been before 1000
B.C., their values were erS and vk respectively. By combining together the letters
added in different parts of Greece, an alphabet of twenty-two letters was formed.
The values of Z and S having been changed from those just stated to Scr and ko-,
Simonides added a twenty-third letter, arcr ; and he then completed the alphabet by

Hadding the long Q. at the end ; changing at the same time the value of from an

aspirate to a long vowel.
   It appears from what has been said that in the earliest Greek writing the vowels

E and O were used to express what were afterwards divided into two vowel sounds;
the former comprehending E and I, the latter O and Y. In like manner, the conso-
             TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                       143

nnants K, and T were used to express not only the sounds that were afterwards

expressed by those letters, but also those that were afterwards expressed by X, *

and e. It is important to attend to this; as the mode of spelling which prevailed
before this distinction was made, was for the most part retained in roots and even
in suffixes of derivation. Thus irivre, iri^inTos might be intended to express not
only the words which those letters would represent when the alphabet was com-
pleted, but also ^LvQf, <bLyL^6os, and so in other instances. Analogy leads us to
think that if the twenty-four letters had been all in use when the language was first
written down, these words would have been written in the last- mentioned mode.

    In these instances the ancient spelling has been preserved, but the pronunciation
which it suggests has been changed. In other instances the spelling has been
altered ; and there is particular need to attend to that change of spelling which was
occasioned by the dropping of the semivowels and the change of 2 to H, and this
again to a sign of aspiration which was dropped in the middle of a word, and not

always expressed at the beginning of one. The examples of 6, j), originally 20,

2IA, then HO, HIA, or HA, and of avbava, originally 2YANAANO, will sufficiently

illustrate what is meant.

On the supposed Biblical Names of Baalbec, and on the position of Baalgad.

  By John Hogg, M.A.y F.R.S., L.S., R.G.S. ^c, Foreign Secretary of

   the Royal Society of Literature.

The author began this communication with some remarks on the vast interest

which has recently become attached to the geography, both historical and physical,

of the Bible ; especially since the important geographical and topographical excava-
tions and discoveries in ancient Assyria, and other parts of the East, have thrown

fresh light upon many portions of Scripture. Also, as regards the cartography of

Syria and Palestine, much had been done of late years by Russegger, Robinson,

Porter, Van de Velde, and the officers of the American Survey. The author said,
that notwithstanding these great additions to science, he felt satisfied that much still
remained uncertain respecting the natural positions of many of the valleys and river-

courses in both Lebanons, a more correct knowledge of the heights of the chief

mountains, the magnetic influences, and certain meteorological phenomena.

Considering that Baalbec had been so long known to travellers and artists, and

its magnificent ruins so often visited and described, it was a remarkable fact that its
Biblical name remained at this day undetermined. And it was further remarkable,

that history has not preserved the name of its founder, or recorded in what year of

the world it was begun to be built. As a Roman colony at the commencement of
the Christian era, under the name of " Hcliopolis," it bore the title of " Julia

Augusta," derived from its benefactors, Julius and Augustus Caesars.

The author then showed that it could not answer in geographical details to

Baalath, or Baal-Hamon, or Balamo, or Baal Hermon, or Baalah, or Baalgad, of
the Scriptures. Dr. Robinson of America imagines with much probability, that the

prophet Amos, in chap. i. v. 5, alluded to Baalbec {Heliopolis) and its idol- worship,

where he mentions " the plain of Aven," or as it is given in the margin of the Bible,

" Bikath Aven." This would seem to refer to the plain of Coelesyria, or the Bukaa,

meaning a " valley," which lies between the Lebanons, or the range of Libanus, and

that of Anti-Libanus. Mr. Hogg observed that this ' allusion ' had long ago occurred

Wm.to the traveller Maundrell, and to Dr.  Lowth. The Septuagint translators
-- --having rendered the Hebrew word 'Aven' by On the Heliopolis of Egypt thought

the same. As this word 'QN is supposed to mean in Egyptian the sun, so the Sep-
tuagint rightly translated it Heliopolis ; consequently Bikath Aven would signify the

Bukaa On, or ' plain of Om;' that is to say, the plain or valley of Heliopolis.

The author, in this supposition, agreed with those writers, and he further remarked

that the word Baalbec has the same meaning in Aramaic or ancient Syriac, viz. the

"Sun-city."

In the next place, as to the geographical position of Baalgad, Mr. Hogg, having

demonstrated from the descriptions contained in Scripture, that it could not coincide

with the site of Baalbec, as has been strongly urged by many authors, considered
--144 REPORT 1857.

that Dr. Robinson's supposition of Baalgad having been " no other than the secluded
grotto," Paninm near Paneas, now called Banias, was quite untenable. He, on the
contrary, conceived that the ancient and long-lost -Baa^^rac^ must have stood either in
Wadi £' Teim, or in a neighbouring smaller valley of Lebanon, on the west of, and
under Mount Hermon, named at this day the ' Mountain of the Chief,' or Gebel E'
Sheikh. Indeed, he said that a hope might be entertained that among the numerous
ancient ruins and temples still remaining in the Wadis near the Lebanon, some
vestiges of Baalgad might yet be discovered, when more careful explorations shall
have been made, in the secluded western gorges adjacent to the noble Hermon.

   Mr. Hogg pointed out the supposed position of Baalgad, as it accorded with the
accounts of Holy Writ, on a sketch map which he had coloured and drawn on a
scale eight-times enlarged, from a part of Kiepert's " New Map of Palestine and
Coelesyria," 1856, extending from nearly 33° 14' to 34° north latitude, and from
about 35° 35' to 36° 11' east longitude ; and he also explained from it the sites of

other Biblical localities, as well as the present courses of the principal rivers in that

portion of Syria.

    On the Cause of the Mild Winter Temperature of the British Islands.
                                  By T. Hopkins.

    In this paper the writer combated the opinion that the mild winter temperature of

the north-western part of Europe is attributable to the warm ocean stream that flows
from the Gulf of Mexico into the Atlantic Ocean. He denied that the mere con-
tiguity of a warm current makes the adjoining country warm. In support of this,
it was shown that the parts of America close to the Gulf and the warm stream, are
not warmed by them. On the contrary, Louisiana and Florida, notwithstanding
their vicinity to the warm water, were shown to have cold winter climates ; and this

character attaches to the sea-board of America that extends parallel with the Gulf-

stream.

    It was shown that Dove's Isothermal line for the month of January, of 50° Fahr.,
passed over the 45° of latitude in the Pacific Ocean, but that it descended to the 32nd
degree near the Gulf of Mexico, and when crossing the warm Florida stream the line
rose but little; yet as it passed to the middle of the Atlantic it ascended to the same
latitude that it passed over in the Pacific, thus showing that it was as cold over the
warm stream in a southern as in the middle of the Atlantic in a northern latitude.
Extracts were given from Dr. Scoresby's paper on the temperature of the northern
Atlantic, in which it was shown that the cold current -which flows from Baffin's
Bay, and passes the island of Newfoundland, intervenes between the Gulf-stream
and the ocean to the north of 40° of latitude, stopping its progress east in that
latitude. These facts, it was contended, showed that the warm water of the Gulf-
stream flowed, as described by Humboldt, towards the Azores, and therefore could
not warm the north-west parts of Europe.

    It was stated also that an ocean current runs from 7° of south latitude along the
Brazilian and eastern Patagonian coasts, but that it no more warms those countries
than the Gulf-stream does the adjacent parts of America, all these countries being
dry and cool in the winter season. It was contended that the mild winter climate
of the British Islands was due to copious condensation of vapour brought from the
surface of the Atlantic Ocean. This vapour is condensed freely in the winter and
warms the atmosphere, the vapour giving out its heat of elasticity to the air, this
warmth extending to other parts in proportion to the amount of vapour condensed.
The Isle of Skye in Scotland is warm in the winter, and it is recorded that more rain
had fallen in that island in the single month of January than falls in Paris or London

 in a year.
    Instances were given of sudden changes of winter weather from cold to warm, in

 Manchester and Paris, under circumstances which proved that much heat was
 brought to those parts in vapour. Other parts of the world, distant from the tro-
 pics, were also pointed out, which were rendered warm in their winters by conden-
 sation of vapour, and not through the contiguity of a warm ocean. The north-west
 coast of America, up to the latitude of 60°, has as warm a winter climate as the
 western coast of Europe in the same latitudes. And Western Patagonia and Cape

Horn, extending from 40° to 54° of latitude, have very warm winters, although the

ocean that laves their shores is cold ; but the winter rains are heavy and constant.

   The general conclusion drawn in the paper was, that the British Islands, as well
as many other countries in cold latitudes, but which have warm winters, have their

winter climates determined by condensation of vapour.

On the application of a Decimal Scale to the construction of Maps.

                     By W. Hughes, F.R.G.S.

   The writer urged the desirability of using a system of decimal scales, not merely
in the case of the national surveys undertaken by the governments of different nations,
but as a principle which might with advantage be adopted in all maps, of whatever
size, and which would prove especially valuable in those designed for educational

purposes. The Ordnance Map of Great Britain contrasts disadvantageously with

the national surveys of other countries, in the fact that, of the different scales used
from time to time in its construction, no one of the number bears a decimal ratio to
the earth's quadrant. In the case of ordinary maps, where uniformity of scale is un-
attainable, the various scales employed might yet always bear a decimal ratio to one
another. In proof of this, the paper was accompanied by a series of projections,
such as might be used for the various maps embraced within an ordinary Atlas.

Thus, supposing Europe to be drawn on a scale of iq (,oo^,,ou ' -^^'^ ^'^'^ Africa would

be delineated on exactly half that measure, or 20 000 000 ' North and South America

Aon a scale of 17-5^5-^-                               scale    of               would  correspond  to the      required

                                                                      ^ ^^^ ^^^

dimensions for a map of the British Islands, and also for maps of France, Spain,

Prussia, Austria, Turkey, Italy, &c. Switzerland, Holland, Belgium, Greece, and

other countries would be on a scale of                          jjjfjjj;^.       The same principle might of course

be adopted in the case of divisional maps, such as the counties of England, for

example. Thus if the allotted size would allow of Surrey being drawn to a scale of

                           -,  Lancashire  (a  larger  county)  might  be        on  ^55;^ of the  natural  measure,  and

;m, om,

so on.

The writer pointed out the advantages attendant on the use of such a system,

in the facility of comparison between different maps, and in the more definite

character which might be given to the features which the maps drawn on progressive

scales would embrace. For educational uses especially, the value of attention to

such points can hardly be over-rated. It is from maps that our ideas of distance

and magnitude, in respect of geographical objects, are chiefly derived in early life,

and no after-teaching will counteract the erroneous impressions that are often

imbibed at that period. Proportionate distances and magnitudes, referred to an

easily-comprehended standard, are the basis of all sound geographical knowledge.

On Routesfrom Lima to the Navigable Branches of the Amazon, with Notes
  on Eastern Peru as afieldfor Colonization. By Santiago Jackson.

The first part of this paper was on some geographical details of no great interest.

On the subject of colonization, it was stated that a colony of 200 or 300 Europeans

desirous of settling on the eastern slope of the Amazon, ought to arrive at Lima in

April or May, and have a depot of food provided at their destination beforehand,

enough to last about four months, at the end of which time they would be able to

live on the produce of their fields. Neglect of this precaution has caused the failure

of several attempts at colonization, for the natives cannot supply any unexpected

demand.

The resources of the Amazon territory are unsurpassed in the world. It will

produce any quantity of sugar, coffee, tobacco, indigo, cochineal, rice, and cotton.

The latter is better than any grown in the United States, except the Sea Island.

Cinchona bark, dye-woods of various kinds, India rubber, and gutta percha have

been discovered. Cedar trees of enormous size abound ; but the forests are encum-

bered by dense brushwood, through which one must cut one's way. Savannahs are
found in a few places. Gold, silver, copper, iron, sulphur, cinnabar, coal, and other
minerals are known to exist. The rivers swarm with fish.

   The climate varies in different localities ; it is healthiest highest up the rivers. The
country in its wild state is liable to low intermittent fevers, which however in great
part disappear when it is cleared.

   The Peruvian Government is prepared to make large grants of land and give ex-
tensive rights of self-administration to European colonies in the valley of the Amazon.

                     On the Final Arctic Searching Expedition.
                          By Clements R. Markham.

   The search for Sir John Franklin's expedition has been continued with untiring
energy until no less than 21,500 miles of coast-line has been examined ; and the
search for traces of the missing ships has been contracted within those narrow limits
bounded by the western shores of Boothia, King William's Island, and the space
occupied by a strait or deep inlet from Osborn and Wynniath's farthest, to Victoria

   Thither the Expedition commanded by Captain M'Clintock, the father of Arctic
travelling, has proceeded, to solve the mystery which has so long hung over the fate

of our gallant countrymen.
His intention is, after ascertaining the safety of the abundant stores of provisions

left on Beechey Island and in Leopold Sound, first to examine the state of the ice in

Peel Strait, and his prospect of success in this direction appears to be very hopeful.
But should' he fail in his endeavour to force his way down it, it is almost certain that
he will have been able to reach such a position down Prince Regent's Inlet, as to

complete the search by travelling parties in the ensuing spring.

The Expedition which sailed last July, differs from any preceding one, from the
important fact that its commander knows the exact spot to which his search should

be directed. He has gone forth, single-handed, to complete the search for this most
heroic body of men, with the determination of clearing up the mystery which has so

long hung over their fate, and of crowning his long and weary labours with success.
It is satisfactory to find that an officer who has searched from the very first, in

every expedition, through Lancaster Sound, will now, in all probability, have the
                                               work                            and     am
glory of completing  this  deeply interesting                               ;       I      certain that  everyone

here will unite in wishing him all the success that his noble perseverance so well

deserves.

           On the Macrocephali of Hippocrates. By Dr. Minchin.

The singularity of cranial outline which constituted so remarkable a character in
the appearance of the ancient Macrocephali as to have induced Hippocrates to assert
that no other nation had heads in the least resembling them, presents us with a
problem, which, however curious and interesting as a matter of speculation and
inquiry, is nevertheless beset with difficulties of a practical nature when we come to
examine and compare the different statements to be found in the works of Strabo,

Pliny,  Mela, and others, regarding   this singular people.                                the  "  long-heads,"  as
        author of the paper referred  to the various accounts of
   The
given by the several ancient authors. From these he endeavoured to show that they
were probably not a distinct race or tribe ; that, however, in a particular district near
the south-east of the Black Sea, a certain form of cranial elongation appeared, and
that the individuals so constituted were possessed of mental endowments of a peculiar
kind. Thus, Hippocrates says that " they were considered most noble who had the                                      J

                                                                                                                     y

longest heads ;" and Mela describes the long-heads as being " minus feri" than the

other tribes in their vicinity. The author conceives that a recognition of this mental

superiority may probably have suggested originally the practice of infantile skull-

compression, the people ignorantly supposing that the elongation could be imitated

by art and would be followed by a corresponding improvement of the mental capa-

Acity.                                     remarkable passage in the eleventh Book of Strabo lends likelihood to this

supposition. In this passage, a certain tribe is said to have anxiously endeavoured

to appear excessively long-headed and to have foreheads projecting over their beards.

   The author commented at some length upon statements in the writings of

Tschudi, Wagner, Meyer and Rathke, all of whom have endeavoured to prove that

the Macrocephali had heads of the acuminated form which is found among those of

the Peruvians. In opposition to these views, he adduced the case of the first Macro-

cephalic head which had been found in the East, namely, that sent by Asche to

Blumenbach, and figured by the latter in the 'Decades Craniorum.' This head was

elongated antero-posteriorly, and was of a wholly different stamp from Peruvian

pointed heads. The author proved by a reference to numerous instances of an
exactly similar head-form, that this elongation was a natural shape. He entered

into a brief anatomical description of the cause of the elongation of these heads, and

exhibited to the Section some well-marked examples ; one of these was the skull of

a child aged three and a half years, whom he had seen during life. In this cranium

could be seen the central vertical point of ossific origin, from which sprang originally

a single os bregmatis in place of two parietals. The absence of an interparietal (or

sagittal) suture at this early age, vsras considered by those present as a remarkable

feature of tbis cranium. But in fact all the long-heads with overhanging foreheads

have this same constitution of the vertex. It is this original central ossification

which gives a fixed character to the shape of the middle region of the head, and pre-

cludes the enlargement of the skull in a transverse direction during the period of

growth                                     the skull therefore is obliged to enlarge excessively in some other direction
                                        ;

wherever the open sutures permit, and the result is a decided elongation fore-and-

aft. In the organic kingdoms it has been observed that occasionally very singular

varieties will occur, which seem to be almost a distinct species, capable of repro-

ducing similar varieties; these, however, disappear, and afterwards reappear spo-

radically at irregular intervals. Now, in several countries of Europe within com-

--paratively few years, many instances of skulls have been observed, having the ana-

tomical characters described above, the elongated shape, overhanging forehead,

vertical ossification. The author conceives that it is more consistent with the prin-

ciples of cerebral physiology to suppose the Macrocephali to have been thus consti-

tuted, than to say that because Hippocrates has mentioned the custom of skull-com-

pression in connexion with these people, their heads must have been necessarily

acuminated ; for in the treatise on injuries of the head, by the same venerable author,
pointed heads are called by the Homeric term (fio^oL

The author conceives that the fact of several skulls of the latter shape having been

found, some at Kerch, and one at Grafeneck, does not tend to prove the prevalence

of an artificial custom in later times (e. g. among the Avars and Huns) in that part

of the world, for the entire number of these heads which has as yet been found does

not exceed six, and not one of them has been found within a tumulus or accompanied

with other bones of the skeleton, while in several sepulchral mounds, near to which

pointed heads have been found, entire skeletons have been discovered, but with

normally-shaped skulls. The most recent investigations have shown that the stray,

solitary instances of acuminated and compressed heads found in Europe, may all be

referred to one and the same period, namely that of Charles V. ; they have been

brought over from Peru and afterwards cast adrift. These heads therefore throw

no light whatever upon the probable shape preserved by the heads of the so-called

race of extinct Macrocephali.

In fine, the author thinks it highly probable that the crania of the earliest Ma-

crocephali possessed the same shape as that described by Blumenbach in the 'Decades

Craniorum,' and that the reappearance of this form as a sporadic phenomenon in
many parts of Europe in the present day, gives support to this hypothesis ; moreover,

this shape has been found in many living instances to be associated with a superior

of tlie sides ; roundness and projection of frontal region ; absence of sagittal suture

this last being the determining cause of all the other peculiarities. It may easily be
imagined how this flattened appearance of the temporal regions may have suggested

the custom of compression spoken of by Hippocrates.

    On the Remains of early Stone-built Fortresses and Habitations in the

          County of Kerry. By George V. Du Noyer, M.R.I.A.

   In this paper attention was directed to a class of Celtic antiquities hitherto but
slightly noticed by archieologists, and in this instance to an extensive group of those
buildings discovered by the author in the summer of 1856, and which occupy a line
of three miles in extent along the southern tope of Mount Eagle; they amount to
more than seventy in number, and he considered he was justified in calling this
remarkable collection of edifices erected in pre-historic times, " a Celtic city."

   The buildings consisted of massive stone houses of dry masonry, variable in their
internal ground-plan, which was sometimes circular or elliptical, or a waved-oval,
or semi-oval, or semicircular, or square; and in one instance, north of Kilmalkedar,
the house consisted of ivio apartments, one square and the other circular, both con-
nected by a straight passage ; when perfect, these buildings terminated in a dome-
shaped roof; the stones, overlapping each other on the wall, rose till one stone closed
in the top. Groups of such houses are often surrounded by a massive stone wall,

as if intended for warlike purposes, or they occur singly of one, two, or three separate
apartments, more or less circular in plan, and evidently intended for residences merely;

some are yet quite perfect, but generally the roofs have fallen in. One of the most

important of the former class is called " Caher-na-mactirech," or the stone Fort of

the Wolves, and it presents many peculiarities of architecture which renders it unique
of its kind. Of the latter class he instanced a triple-chambered building, waved
oval in plan, and 80 feet in its longest diameter; this is known as " Caher-fada-an-

doruis," or the long Fort of the Doors.
   The highest authorities on Irish Archaeology attribute the erection of such buildings

as are described in this paper to the Firbolg and Tuatha de Danann tribes, who

inhabited this country prior to the introduction of Christianity.
    In conclusion, the author dwelt on what must have been the habits as well as the

probable social condition of the people who erected such rude and solid buildings,

which, from their sequestered position and other favouring causes, have been preserved
through the lapse of ages to the present time.

Abstract of the Report of James Anderson, Esq., Chief Factor of the Hud-
   son's Bay Company, commandirig a Searching Party that descended the
     Great Fish River in quest of the Remains of the Crews of the ' Erebus'

   and ' Terror' in 1855. By Sir John Riciiardson, R.N., F.R.S.

   The author gives the details of his survey, illustrated by a map of a new route
between the Mountain Portage on the shores of the Great Slave Lake and the Lake
Aylmer of Sir George Back, comprising about 200 miles of water communication,
 interrupted by rapids and short portages.

   On Lake Franklin, near the mouth of the Great Fish River, Mr. Anderson came to

 an Eskimo encampment of three tents. The inmates were in possession of various
 articles that had belonged to Sir John Franklin's party, viz. a letter-clip bearing date
 1843, fragments of elm, oak, mahogany, and white pine boards, some of them
 painted white. From the want of an interpreter it was very difficult to obtain correct
 answers to queries from these simple and friendly people. Printed books were shown
 to them and pieces of written paper, with the offer of large rewards for anything of
 the kind, but they signified that they had none. The women exhibited much intelli-
gence, and apparently a ready comprehension. They made signs by pressing the

stomach inwards, pointing to their mouths, and shaking their heads piteously, that
these things were obtained from a kayack of a party who had died of starvation.

Two men of the same tribe were met further down the river, but nothing more was

learnt from them.
    Mr. Anderson remained three days on Montreal Island and thoroughly explored

every part of it. The spot where the expedition boat had been cut up was on a rocky
ridge at its north-eastern extremity. The ground there was strewed with shavings
of wood, ends of plank, &c., evidently cut by the natives. On a piece of board that
was painted black, the name " Erebus" was carved. Small pieces of rope containing
the coloured dock-yard threads, pieces of bunting, &c., were lying about. There
being many Eskimo caches in the neighbourhood, they were opened, and in them
were found, besides stores of seal oil, blacksmith's tools, a tomahawk, a chain-hook,

a fragment of an unwrought iron bar, a bundle of ash sticks, being parts of snow-
shoe frames with " Mr. Stanley" carved on one, together with some pieces of hoop-
iron, parts of instruments, a bit of cane, and a piece of the leather of a backgammon
board, but not a scrap of paper nor a human bone. Every mound was examined in
search of graves, but without success. Both coasts of the peninsula, from Elliot
Bay northward, were minutely searched, but nothing more was found except a bit
of cod-line and a rag of striped cotton on Point Ogle. Maconochie Island was also
carefully traversed, but the state of the ice hindered the canoes from crossing to

Point Richardson. On the return, part of the eastern shores of the estuary was also
examined, and the Eskimos at Lake Franklin were again visited. They were now
assembled to strike their tents and move elsewhere, and the strength of the party
was seen to be five men, three women, and twelve lads and children. Mr. Anderson

spread all his trading stores before them and offered the whole for books or papers,
but they signified that they had none, and opened all their caches to show what they

actually had. In the caches were found an oval frying-pan, a chisel, a broken hand-
saw, a piece of a metal thermometer-scale, and part of an ivory rule. Most of the
paddles of the party were made out of ash-oars.

   These people made Mr. Anderson comprehend that they had not seen the ships

or great kayacks, but that they had heard from others of their being wrecked, and
that the crews had all died of starvation. Mr. Anderson, judging from the quantity
of drift sand on Montreal Island and on the adjoining peninsula, thought that if the
expedition perished there, their bodies would be covered by that material.

On the Routes pursued by Herren Hermann, Adolphe, and Robert Schlagint-

   weit in India, the Himalayas, Tibet, and Turhistan. By Robert

    SCHLAGINTWEIT.

    This paper was introduced by a short account of a demi-official nature regarding
their mission to India. Mr. Schlagintweit mentioned in the highest terms the labours
of their predecessors in scientific researches in India, particularly amongst many
others, Buist, Cunningham, Everest, Gerards, Hodgson, Hooker, Oldham, Strachey,
Sykes, Thompson, Waugh, &c.

    In reference to their official position, they were particularly indebted to Col,
Sykes, as well as to the Royal Society under Gen. Sabine's directions.

   In 1854 they reached India, and passed from Bombay to Madras, through Central
India, each by different routes, making geological, geographical, and other scientific
investigations as they proceeded. On their sea voyage previously, they had made
observations as to the specific gravity of sea-water, and also as to the currents of the
sea, and continued these in the voyage from Madras to Calcutta.
'. On arriving at Calcutta in the beginning of 1855, Mr. Hermann Schlagintweit set

out for the northern provinces of Bengal, and, having reached Sikkim, continued his
 researches all along the Himalayas, with a view of ascertaining their height and
 geographical position. To the west of Kunchinjinga he met with a remarkably high
mountain, mentioned in a letter to Baron Humboldt (July 10, 1855, summit of
                                           --

150 REPORT 1857.

Phulloot) ; this is the same mountain, exceeding 29,000 feet English, which, inde-
pendent of Mr. Hermann Schlagintweit's measurements, was signalized in 1856 by
Col. Waugh, from the Proceedings of the Trigonometrical Survey, as the highest
mountain, and was called by him Mount Everest, after his distingui.shed predecessor.

    This is the highest mountain in the world at present known, being considerably
over 29,000 feet above the level of the sea. The natives have two names for it : one
of them, Gaurisankar, which is mythological, is to be found only in the Nepaulese
territories ; and the second name, Chingopanmari, is that by which it is known among
the people of Tibet to the north. The name Deodunga, which was mentioned by
Mr. Hodgson occasionally ia connexion with this peak, was not the name of this
mountain, but of a small mountain some 8000 feet high, which lies in the same
direction when seen from Katmandoo.

     It is very remarkable that the signification of Gaurisankar, a Sanscrit word, is
identical with the Bhutea word Chaura Cha ri, probably the highest peak of
Bhutan proper.

    Gauri Chanca means the female deity.
     SanJcar Cha, the male god, Sankar especially being a form for Shiva.
    Ri, in Bhutea (mountain) is the only part not represented in Gaurisankar.
    After leaving Sikkim, Hermann, having examined a part of the Bhootan Hima-
 layas and Upper Assam, returned to Calcutta by the Brahmapootra and the delta
 of the Ganges. Adolphe and Robert left Calcutta in March 1855, and after passing
 through the north-western provinces, reached Nainital, and then went to Milum,
 and thence to Tibet.
    They investigated the geographical and other features of the country as they went
 on ; the principal of which was the alluvial deposit along an immense valley, the
 largest probably in the world. In this vedley the Indus and the Dihong both take
 their rise, and flow in opposite directions, but nearly in one line, for hundreds of
 miles, their origin being separated only by a small rise in the surface of the valley.
 They then went to the Ibi Gamin, and having encamped on a glacier there, at the
 height of 19,220 feet, on the evening of the 18th of August, they on the 19th of
 August succeeded in reaching the flanks of the Ibi Gamin (called Kamet by Capt.
 Strachey), at the height of 22,260 feet, the greatest height which had ever been
 attained on any mountain. They returned to the plains of Hindostan by difl"erent
 routes, each pursuing his special inquiries.
     Mr. Robert then entered into some details respecting the operations during the

 next cold season. He went to Central India, where he visited the plateau of Amar-

 kantak, which is only about 3300 English feet above the level of the sea, though it
 is erroneously supposed to be 8000 feet. Four rivers take their rise in the neigh-
 bourhood of this plateau, the Nerbudda, the Soane, the Fohilla, and the Mahanaddy.

    Mr. Adolphe went through Central and Southern India down to Trichinopoly,
 visited the Nilgherries, and returned afterwards by Madras and Calcutta to the
 North-west provinces.

     The three brothers again met at Simla, previous to commencing the operations
 intended for the summer of 1856.

     Mr. Adolphe, on leaving that place, crossed the Himalaya, went over Tibet, Bal-
  tistan, and visited the interesting spot where several mountain crests meet, and the

 Hindoo Koosh joins the range lying to the north of India. He then returned to the

  Punjab through the valley of Cashmere.

    MM. Hermann and Robert proceeded to Ladak by different routes. Under good

  disguises, they were enabled to penetrate into Turkistan proper, by crossing the
  Karakoroom and the Kuenluen mountains and descending into the great valley of
  Yarkand, a region never visited before, not even by Marco Polo. It is a vast depres-
  sion of between 3000 and 4000 feet, separating the Kuenluen, on the northern fron-

 -- --tier of the Himalaya Tibetan system of mountains from the Syan Chane, or the

  mountains of Central Asia, on the southern border of Russia. They then returned
  to Ladak, and entered the Punjab by different routes through Cashmere, where they
  again met all three, for a short time, at Rowulpiodee.

     From there, their routes were the following ones :
     After a two years' negotiation, Mr. Hermann was, at the commencement of 1857,
  admitted into Nepaul, where he determined the altitudes of Mount Marhipoorha and
----                           --

TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.      151

MouQt Yassa, which have hitherto been vaguely called the Dhawalagery, which means
nothing else but " snow crests," and is applicable to all snow-capped mountains.

   Mr. Robert proceeded to Bombay through Scinde, Kutsch and Guzerat, where he
surveyed the chain called the Salt Range, and determined the changes effected in

the course of centuries in the bed and direction of several rivers. Before returning
to Europe, he stayed a month in Ceylon.

   Mr. Adolphe visited various parts of the Punjab and of Cabul. He intended to
return to Europe in a few months, when by the spreading out of the revolution in
India this became impossible. He seems to have made the best of his time by re-
turning on a more western route than his brothers to Yarkand, from where the last

indirect news which have reached Europe are from July.

                On some Human Races in India and Upper Asia.
                         By Hermann Schlagintweit.

   The principal races of India are,
   1. The Aborigines; they live now in various mountainous parts of India, for
example in the small mountains in the south of Bengal, in Central India, in the

Nilgherries, &c.
   2. The Brahmins and their descendants by intermixture with original tribes of

India.

   3. The Mohammedan Mongols, also crossed with the tribes 1 and 2.
   4. The Buddhist Mongols, who have kept themselves very pure.
   5. The Fetish-worshipers, likewise Mongols, and in the mountains between India
and Burmah, almost as savage as the inhabitants of Australia.
    1. The Aborigines of India consist in India itself of the following tribes: a. God.

b. Bheels. c. Kols. d. Santals. e. Tudas.
   Another very numerous series of tribes, which are very similar to them physically,

occur in Tartary, along the entire foot of the Himalaya.

   By the remarkably dark colour of their faces, by their thick, protruded hps, they

approach very closely to the type of the Africans, especially in the lower part of the
face. They are essentially distinct from all the other tribes of India. Their fore-
head is, however, usually far better formed than in the Africans. With regard to the
separate parts of the skeleton also, these races are furthest removed from the Euro-

peans.

   They are at a very low stage of civilization, and many of them have no written

lauguage, at least at present. Their clothing is very miserable, consisting of a cloth

wound round the loins ; they have no covering for the feet, and, what is peculiarly
characteristic, they alone, amongst all the inhabitants of India, are able to withstand
the influence of the sun without any covering for the head. They live by breeding
cattle, and by miserable husbandry in the uncultivable wildernesses of Central and
Southern India, in small huts formed of twigs and branches of trees, which they have
erected in open places which occur amongst the jungles. They also alone can endure
the miasmatic air which is evolved during the raiuy season in their forests, and which

is so dangerous to all the other races of India.
    Their natural shyness and timidity has been greatly increased by the haughty con-

tempt with which they have been treated by the castes of the other inhabitants of

India ; not unfrequently they are seen to take flight into the thickest wilderness at
the first glance of a European.

   2. The second principal class is formed by the Brahmins and their descendants,
which are now best understood under the names of the Indian castes.

  --The Brahmins and their descendants are divided into the four following great

groups: J. Brahmins. 2. Tschatrya, Chatrya. 3. Vhaysias. 4. Sudras.
   Each of these four principal groups includes a great number of castes, produced

in the following manner :

   When the Brahmins, who we will regard as a homogeneous tribe when they came

from the Himalaya to India, mixed with the tribes of the Autochthones of India,
namely with the Gods, Santals, &c. ; their posterity formed a great number of castes,
as the descendants of a Brahmin, with every other tribe, were regarded as quite new

castes. Moreover, the number of castes was increased by the Mohammedan Mon-
                                                              --

--152 REPORT 1857.

gols who subsequently penetrated into the country, and their strict separation and
nomenclature was enjoined and sanctioned by religion. As soon as a caste contained
a considerable number of members, these intermarried almost exclusively amongst
themselves alone, and followed a mode of life which was very different not only from
that of the other groups, but sometimes even from that of their allied tribes. The
altered mode of life continued for centuries, and the strict separation from the other
castes have exerted so essential an influence upon the physical character and deve-

lopment, that at the present day castes which, ethnographically considered, belong
to one and the same group, have become so essentially different, which was not the
case at first, that it is often impossible, without tracing the historical formation of
the castes, to determine with certainty the degree of their connexion from their

 physical characters alone.

    As one of the most strongly marked examples of the influence which the mode of

--life exerts upon the physical development, we may refer to the three principal divi-

 sions of the Brahmin's : the Cashmiri Brahmins, who eat flesh ; the Kannanj
Brahmins, who live upon vegetable food ; and the Bengali Brahmins, who enjoy the
 privilege of having an unlimited number of wives, even from the lower castes. The
 Cashmiri Brahmins are of powerful frames, have pale faces even when they have
lived for generations in India, and are very intelligent and active. [Many of their
 colonies still occur in Delhi and Lucknow ; some also in Nepaul.]

    The Kannanj are weak, destitute of all physical and mental energy, and have a

 peculiar formation of the head.

    The Bengali Brahmins are ambitious and intellectual, but not unfrequently distin-
 guished from the others by the want of an upright and open character.

    As among the Brahmins, great differences have often formed nearly related castes

 in the other groups also.

    I may mention, as a peculiarly characteristic example, the three nearly related

 castes of the Mehtars, Dhobis and Tsamars, belonging to the group of the Sudras,

 which are now most clearly distinguished both in the formation of the face and the

 structure of the body.

    3. The Mohammedan Mongols are to be regarded as the third principal race of the
 inhabitants of India; they have penetrated into India from the Asiatic countries
 bounding India to the north-west, over the Hindoo Coosh and through Affghanistan.
 In their religion they were Mohammedan, perhaps divided into various sects, but at
 all events free from the prejudices of the Indian castes. As soon as they had mixed

 themselves with the Indian tribes, their descendants, in accordance with the Indian

 ideas in general, were raised into a new caste, and now all Mohammedans are
 universally divided into castes, to which they hold strictly, although these are neither
 founded in their religion, nor in the institutions of the countries from whch they
 came as conquerors. The Mohammedans in India fall into the following castes :

 Moghuls, Pashans, Sayyads, Shaiks.
     Simultaneously with the intermixture of the various peoples hitherto referred to,

 a new language, the Hindostani, was also formed, containing elements from all their
 languages, especially from the Sanscrit dialects, the Arabic and Persian. This has
 assisted essentially, so far as it has been diffused, in softening the original separation

 of tribes still speaking differently, such as exists in America, into the slighter di-
 stinction of castes speaking the same language. In those parts where Hindostani
 has not been diffused, for example in the mountains of Central and Southern India,
 in the mountains which separate the valleys of the Brahmaputra and Irawaddy and
 in the parts of the eastern Himalaya inhabited by Mongols, the difference of lan-
 guage has given the diversity of races a very different and far more definite type ; in

 these places even small tribes have been developed, who cannot understand one
 another's language, and are also distinguished far more strongly both physically
 and in their religious and political code, than the corresponding castes of the same
 physical relationship who speak Hindostani.

     4. The Buddhist Mongols constitute the fourth principal class. This class includes
 a great number of tribes, of which I may cite the following as the principal. In the
 eastern Himalaya, in Bhutan and Sikkira, the Bhutias and Lepchas predominate. In
 the northernmost, and at the same time highest parts of Nepal also, there are many
 Mongol tribes on this side of the water-separation of Tibet. In the Western Himalaya
                TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    153

they are no longer pure, but mixed with Brahmin races, and if possible distinguished
into castes even more than in India itself. The principal seat of the Buddhist Mon-
gols, which may be regarded as a great and perfectly homogeneous tribe, is in Tibet,
where they have retained their religion unchanged for centuries perfectly free from
Indian castes ; it is only in a small portion of Tibet, the westernmost, that the Bud-
dhists have been converted to Islam.

   lu Central Tibet itself, when the great caravans from Russia came through Turk-
istan as far as Cashmir, a mixed race between the Tibetans and the Northern Mon-
gols had been formed, which is called Argon : they are Mohammedans.

   5. The half-savage, nearly naked races in the mountains to the east of the Brah-
maputra, constitute another group to be specially referred to. From their most
general characters they belong to the Mongol race, but possess little similarity even
amongst themselves in language and bodily structure. The few rehgious ideas of
the lowest kind which they possess, are also very different in the various tribes.

   6. For the sake of completeness, we have still to mention, as perfectly foreign

races dwelling in India, besides the Europeans and their descendants of mixed race,
the Parsis and Jewish settlers, some of them very ancient, a few Sidis from Africa,
and Armenians, nearly all confined to the west coast of India.

                                 Observations on Vancouver Island.

By Kenneth Leith Sutherland, i?.iV"., Barrister-at-Law, F.R.G.S. ^c.

   This island, situated between the parallels of 48° 19' and 50° 50' north latitude,
deserves the honour of bearing the name of one of those great men England has

good reason to be proud of; but what would Vancouver think of his country-
men, if he could look now upon the natural charms of this island, still breathing in
her undiminished beauty, but no happy Christian population contentedly smiling

through her rich valleys, drawn thye not only to enjoy and partake of the bountiful

goodness of Providence, but to promote the true welfare and conversion of the

poor savages that are thinly scattered over the face of this smiling country, on which

the hand of human industry has not yet been laid ? Here is a soil the richest I know

of, without a human being to draw from it even the minimum of human exertion, a

soil that will  produce whatever the husbandman may design to cultivate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

--aboriginal inhabitants neither plant nor sow, but live upon the spontaneous products

of the soil, a few roots. Do we not claim this island as a part of our possessions ?

and does not this ownership hold us in duty to promote to the utmost of our ability

the amelioration of the moral and civil condition of these savage or semi-barbarous

--Indians, for the purpose of gradually fitting them to assume the characters and

station of freemen, to emancipate these poor creatures from their degraded position

by civilization ? I am sorry to see projects entered into with regard to the coloniza-

tion of this island, that reason and policy, upon a closer investigation, and humanity

itself, would pronounce to be premature. This island, under the existing state of
affairs, is not likely to receive many colonists ; all those who are intending to emi-

grate will be scrupulous in purchasing land. I consider the grant of Vancouver
Island to the Hudson's Bay Company as an unwise act. The evil consequences

attending the Company's exclusive right to the fur trade will be soon felt by every

colonist.

But notwithstanding we make false moves in our colonies, we may be justly proud

of them all, whether they be connected with or independent of the parent state ; and
may feel not a little vain, that the benefits we have conferred on our species, equal,

ay, surpass, what has been accomplished by the whole of the other nations of Europe
put together. The present system, with regard to the sale of lands in a new colony
(especially Vancouver), appears to me to be founded on a false principle. Every frac-
tion produced by the sale of lands in a new colony, should go to the ameliorating the

condition of the aboriginal inhabitants ; if you want a stimulus to immigration to a

particular colony, let not that stimulus be given at the expense of the poor savage.

required for Vancouver is for the Government to encourage emigration by facilitating
the means of transport : and as first impressions are strongest, let there be imported
into Vancouver, colonists possessing the sterling qualities of our British labourer,
fidelity, hardy and industrious habits, and strong domestic affections.

   Tlicie are strodig reasons for assuming that this will turn out a fine mining country

will become the nucleus of everv nation's wealth.

                                                             Section.

In opening the business of this Section there is no occasion for rae to enter into

any lengthened detail of its characteristic objects, for these, I presume, must be

sufficiently known to most of you. Our department is conversant about almost all

the most important transactions of human life, as far, at least, as this present world

is concerned. It is conversant about all that relates to prosperity, national and in-

--dividual, all that relates to the promotionofhonest industry and fair dealing between
-- --man and man, all that relates to the repression of crime, all that relates to the

--spreading of industrious, sober and useful habits, all that relates to the mitigation

--or prevention of famine and pestilence, all these come within our department ; and

if there be any one thing which it is needful that all should have some knowledge of,

--it must be that which all persons are concerned about, vk'hich all persons must do

and attend to, and which it is highly important that they should be instructed how

We Weto do well.                                                       do
collect, and reason from, facts relating to all these matters.

--not encroach on the department of any branch of science, but we lend our aid to

almost all, there is hardly any one which, in its practical results, is not more or less

connected with ours. For example, the procuring of valuable substances from peat,

--which you must have all heard of, that is a matter for the chemist ; the cultivation

of beet for the production of sugar is a matter for the chemist and the agriculturist;

but how far these processes can be made profitable and valuable, that is, how far

they will be worth attending to, is a question that comes within our department.

Again, there is the important invention of the manufacture of soda from sea-salt.

That is a matter, of course, for the chemist. We, in our economic department, have

nothing to do with that; but with the commercial results, and, I may add, the

practical and moral results of it, we are greatly concerned. The increased cheapness

of soda, which has been the result of that invention, has created a very greatly in-

creased demand for soap, through its increased cheapness ; and that has created
an increased demand for the supply of the oils necessary for the manufacture of soap.

That, again, has occasioned a very great demand for palm oil from Africa, which has

contributed to check, more than probably any other cause, the progress of the slave

trade ; because the barbarian African chiefs find that it answers better and is more

profitable to employ their people in extracting palm oil than in kidnapping and selling

them for slaves. I mention these few, and might mention fifty other instances, in

which the results of other branches of science come under our department, and are

to be considered with a great deal of care and attention, in order that we may arrive

at correct results. Some people have, or had, at least some years ago, a sort of

dread that attention to these subjects would lead us to be too worldly and too

attentive to gain ; not considering that our pursuit has no more necessary connexion

with the acquisition of wealth, than it has with charity. Charity everybody allows

to be a virtue; but there is hardly any vice that produces so much mischief as mis-

directed charity ; and how charity may be so directed, and distress so relieved

or prevented, as to occEision the greatest good and the least evil, is a matter that

comes within our department. This world is the place in which we are fixed, and

in which our duties are to be performed ; and it is absolutely necessary, if we would

perform our duties aright, that we should know the circumstances under which

Athose duties are to be performed.  person is not excused from merely meaning

well if he neglects to acquaint himself with all the circumstances which will en-

able him to carry his good intentions into effect ; and therefore it is, that, although

I have said our department is conversant in matters pertaining to this world, yet this

world is connected with the next, as it is the same God that is the author of both

worlds; and it is most essential that we should be acquainted with the circumstances
that regulate human transactions wherein our duties lie. On these subjects I hope

some very interesting and important communications will be made on this and on

succeeding days.

On the Car Establishment of Mr. Bianconi in Ireland. By C. Bianconi.

   Referring to the synopsis of my establishment, submitted in a concise form to

the Association at its Session in Cork, in 1843, I now take the liberty of submitting
some further particulars, embracing its origin, with its present condition, and the

extent of its operations.

  My establishment originated immediately after the peace of 1815, having then had

the advantage of a supply of first-class horses intended for the army, and rating in
price from ten to twenty pounds each, one of which drew a car and six persons with
ease seven miles an hour. The demand for such horses having ceased, the breeding
of them naturally diminished, and, after some time, I found it necessary to put two
inferior horses to do the work of one. Finding I thus had extra horse power, I in-

-- --creased the size of the car, which held six passengers three on each side to one

capable of carrying eight ; and in jjroportion as the breed of horses improved, 1 con-
tinued to increase the size of the cars for summer work, and to add to the number of
horses in winter for the conveyance of the same number of passengers, until I con-
verted the two-wheeled two-horse cars into four-wheeled cars, drawn by two, three
or four horses, according to the traffic on the respective roads and the wants of the
public. This freedom of communication has greatly added to the elevation of the
lower classes ; for, in proportion as they found that travelling by car, with a saving
of time, was cheaper than walking with a loss of it, they began to appreciate the value
of speedy communication, and hence have been, to an almost incalculable extent,

travellers by my cars, where, mixing with the better orders of society, their own moral

 elevation has been of a decided character.
    As the establishment extended, I was surprised and delighted at its commercial and

 moral importance; I found, as soon as I had 0))ened communication with the interior,
the consumption of manufactured goods had greatly increased. The competition of
 parties availing themselves of the facilities of travelling was so great, that instead of
 buying at second-hand, after many profits, they were enabled to obtain the supplies

--nearer the manufacturer in the more remote parts of Ireland. For instance, on

 my opening the communiciition from Tralee to Cahirciveen in the south, Gal way

 to Clifden in the west, and Ballina to Belmullet in the north-west, purchasers were
 obliged to give eight pence or nine pence a yard for calico for shirts subsequently sold
 for three pence and four pence, thus enabling that portion of the population who could
 previously badly afibrd only one shirt each to have two for a less price than was paid

 for one, and in the same ratio other commodities came into general use at reduced

 prices.

--156 REPORT 1857.

The formation of my first car, conveying passengers back to back, on the principle

of the outside car, now so much used in Dublin, was admirably adapted to its purposes,
and it frequently happened that, whilst on one side were sitting some of the higher

classes, persons as opposite in position were seated on the other. Not only was this

imaccompanied with any inconvenience, but I consider its effects were very salutary;

as many who had no status were, by coming into casual communication with the

educated classes, inspired witli the importance of, and respect for, social position.

  The growth and extent of railways necessarily affected my establishment, and

diminished its operation, by withdrawing from it ten two-wheeled cars, travelling

daily 450 miles; twenty-two four-wheeled cars, travelling daily 1G20 miles; five
coaches, travelling daily 37G miles; thus making a total falling off of thirty-seven

vehicles, travelling daily 2452 miles. Notwithstanding this falling off, the consequent

result of the extension of raihvays, I still have over 900 horses, working thirty-five

two-wheeled  cars,   travelling  daily  1752  miles                            twenty-two four-wheeled cars, travel-
                                                                            ;

ling daily 1500 miles ; ten coaches, travelling daily 992 miles; making in the whole

sixty-seven conveyances, travelling daily 4244 miles, and extending over portions of

twenty-two counties, viz. Cork, Clare, Carlow, Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Galway,

King's, Kilkenny, Kerry, Limerick, Longford, Leitrim, Mayo, Queen's, Roscommon,
Sligo, Tipperary, Tyrone, Waterford, Wexford and Westmcath,

   Anxious to aid as well as I could the resources of the country, many of which lay

so Ion" tmproductive, I used this establishment, as far as practicable, to effect so

desirable an object. For instance, I enabled fishermen on the western coast to avail

themselves of a rapid transit for their fresh fish, which, being a very perishable article,

would be comparatively profitless unless its conveyance to Dublin and other suitable

markets could be ensured within a given time, so that those engaged in the fisheries

at Clifden, VVestport, and other places, sending their produce by my conveyances in

one day, coidd rely on its reaching its destination the following morning, additional

horses and special conveyances being provided and put on in the proper seasons. The

myamount realized by this valuable traffic is almost incredible, and has, in                                                                                                                                                        opinion,

lariTcly contributed to the comfort and independence now so happily contrasting with

tl'.e lamentable condition which the west of Ireland presented a few years since.

I shall conclude by two observations, which, I think, illustrate the increasing pros-

perity of the country and the progress of the people. First, although the population

has so considerably decreased by emigration and other causes, the proportion of

travellers by my conveyances is greater, thus demonstrating that the people appre-

ciate not only the money-value of time, but also the advantages of an establishment
designed and worked for their particular use and development, now forty-two years

in operation. Secondly, the peaceable and high moral bearing of the Irish people,
which can only be known and duly appreciated by those who live amongst them, and

who have, as I have had, long and constant intercourse with them. 1 have therefore

been equally surprised and pained to observe in portions of the respectable press, both

in England and Ireland, repeated attacks on the morality of our population, charging
them with a proneness to violate the laws and with a disregard of private property

--but as one fact is worth a thousand assertions, I offer, in contradiction of those state-

ments, this indisputable fact: j\Iy conveyances, many of them carrying very in»-
portant mails, have been travelling during all hours of the day and night, often in

lonely and unfrequented places ; and during the long period of forty-two years that

my establishment has been in existence, the slightest injury has never been done by
                                 or that entrusted to my care                                                                                                                                                                       and this fact gives me
mythe people to      property,                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

On some of the Principal Effects of the Neio Gold, as an Instrument of Pur-
  chase^ on the Production and Distribution of Real Wealth. By Professor

   Cairnes.
   The expression " as an instrument of purchase," was used in order to exclude the

consideration of the indirect effects of the gold discoveries on real wealth, through

TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  15?

the influence which they would exercise on the dispersion of mankind, and the ques-
tion was thus narrowed to the effects of the new gold, in its capacity as a portion of
the general circulating medium of commercial nations.

   Viewed in this light, it was contended that the new gold had no direct tendency to
stimulate industry or increase real wealth (understanding hy this latter term com-
modities which contribute to human enjoyment as distinguished from " money," or
tiie instrument for exchanging such commodities). The gold discoveries had not

added to the fertility of natural agents, nor to the intelligence of capitalists, nor to the

health or strength of labourers ; nor, therefore, except so far as gold was desired on
its own account (that is to say, so far as it was not used as money), to the motives to

exertion of the human race. A given sacrifice would now produce more gold than

formerly, but not more of any other thing. So far, therefore, as " other things" were
the inducement to exertion, the new gold could not stimulate industry or increase

--real wealth ; luiless it did so in one or other of the following ways ; viz. first, by

practising some illusion on the understanding, so as to induce men to undergo a

greater sacrifice for a given reward than formerly ; or secondly, by causing such a
change in the distribution of wealth, as might, at the expense of the idle or less
actively producing classes and nations, operate as a premium on its production.

   In both these ways it was contended that the new gold would lead to an augmen-

tation of the real wealth of society.

    With regard to the first, it was shown, that after gold through the increase in its
quantity had become depreciated in value, the recognition of the change in its whole
extent would not be immediate. jglOO would cease to represent the same quantity
of commodities as before, but its influence upon the mind as a stimulus to exertion
would not at once decline in the same proportion. Those who gained by the monetary
revolution would appear to gain more, and those who lost would appear to lose less
and both, measuring their reward rather by its nominal than by its real standard,
would, for a time and until the rise in prices had been very decidedly established, be,
as it were, cheated into increased exertions. All would more or less feel the influ-
ence of the new gold in this respect, but those who would be most infinitely affected

by it would be those in the determination of whose remuneration competition was
modified by custom-- such as the recipients of fixed salaries, fees, &c.

   But secondly, the new gold tended to augment real wealth through its effects on

distribution.

   The effect of the new gold was not, according to the popular idea, to increase the
demand for commodities in general, but to cause a redistribution of purchasing power,
and thus to cause a disturbance in the demand for commodities. It was the same in
effect as if a tax were levied over the world, and the proceeds deposited in the sands
of Australia and California. Those who gai)ied by the new monetary changes did not
gain simply because their money incomes were increased, but because they were

raised relatively to those of others : they could therefore appropriate a larger share of

the general wealth ; and, for the contrary reason, those whose money incomes were
not similarly affected, could appropriate a smaller share than before. The gain
depended on the rise in money income as compared with the rise in the price of the
articles on which it was expended. It followed therefore, that, for a given amount of
gold, those who gained most were the original finders, and, the earlier it was found,

the greater the gain.

    Applying these principles to the case in hand, the gold-finders were the greatest
gainers, the merchants and manufacturers who were best able to supply their most
pressing needs were gainers in the next degree, and afterwards those who could supply
the wants of such merchants and manufacturers ; or, turning from classes to nations,
the gold countries were the greatest gainers by the new gold ; the United States and
England the next ; while the countries who would suffer most by the new movement
would be such countries as India and China, who would not receive their share till it
had first operated on prices in most of the markets of the world. England during the

Russian war could, in consequence of the gold discoveries, command with a given
outlay of labour and capital a greater amount of gold than before. With this gold she
came into the markets of Turkey, which had not yet felt the effects of the Australian
 discoveries, and carried oft" an increased amount of such things as she required, to
the injury, of course, of all her competitors in the same market. The pressure of

 the war-straiu was thus lightened in proportion to her cheapened cost of obtaining gold.
--158 REPORT 1857.

   In further illustration of the same principle, the trade of England and America with
India and China in recent years was referred to. During the last seven years, not
less than sixty millions sterling in gold and silver had been sent to the East in pay-

ment of increased imports from oriental countries. This was, in other words, to say
that real wealth to that amount had, during that time, been obtained from these
countries for which, not " real wealth," but money had been returned. It was evident,
therefore, that unless India and China had worked very much harder during that
period, they must in real wealth be very much poorer. The new gold thus tended to
enrich En<yland and America and the gold countries at the expense of India and

China and countries similarly situated.

Such being the effect of the new gold on the distribution of real wealth, it was not

difficult to see that the effect of the change would be indirectly to stimulate its pro-

duction. In every instance the transfer was in favour of the more active of th.e pro-

ducing classes and nations at the expense of the idle or less active, and, in general,

in favour of the Anglo-Saxon race at the expense of the rest of the world. The effect

w'ould be the same as if a tax were laid on the idle for the benefit of tlie industrious.

   The character of the new movement being determined by these principles, the

--magnitude of the consequences resulting would depend on two conditions: first, on

the  permanent  diminution which should  be     effected  in  the  cost of producing                                                                                gold
                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

and secondly, on the slowness with which this diminution in cost would be neutralized

in the general rise of prices which would result.

From the rise which had been established in money-wages in the gold countries, it

was deduced that the cost of obtaining gold had in these countries been diminished

by one half. Prices, therefore, in these countries would rise in general to double

their former range, and the laws of international e.Kchange would tend to bring about

a corresponding advance in all other countries.

The rate at which the advance took place would depend, not simply on the actual

quantity of gold annually produced, nor yet on the relation of the new increments to

the quantity previously in existence, but also on the extensions wliich the trade of the

world would in the mean time undergo ; and, considering the great increase of pro-

ductive power lately brought into operation, as exemplified in the extension of rail-

ways the development of free trade, the improvements in ship building, the electric

telegraph, and the increased application of scientific inventions to productive pro-

gggggs there was every reason to expect that such extensions of commerce would be

considerable, and that thus the rise in prices would not be so rapid as, looking simply

to the increased production of gold, we might be led to expect.

   From these principles it followed that in all future extensions of trade England

--and America (including under these names the gold countries their colonies) would
--have a double interest: first, from the advantage which, in common with all com-

mercial nations, they would derive from a more efficient application of the productive

forces of the world ; and secondly, from the special benefits which, as gold-producing

countries, they would enjoy through retarding influence which such extensions of trade

would exert    on the general range  of prices  throughout the world                                                                                                thereby enabling
                                                                                                                                                                 ;

them to avail themselves, to a greater extent and for a longer time, of their cheapened

cost of gold.

Census, in which, assuming that the proportion of the active, ruling, and productive
portion of the population would be found nearly represented by the number of males
from 25 to 55 years of age, it was shown that this proportion was considerably higher in
the north-western division of the kingdom than in the rest of it ; higher in Manches-
ter (including Salford) than in the north-western division ; and considerably higher in
Liverpool than in Manchester. Details were also given showing the relative propor-
tions in each case of the female, and of the immature and aged male population,

making up, in each case, the remnant of the population. And from the materials

thus stated were deduced the general conclusions,
    That as not only the productive and defensive power, but also the character and

conduct of a given population is dependent, in a great measure, upon the ages of
the individuals composing it, so sanitary improvements, by lengthening the dura-
tion of life, tend directly to increase the proportion of mature and aged persons to
the whole of the population on which they take effect, thus prolonging the effects
of experience upon such a population; and when taken with the prestige commonly

conferred upon opinions by the ages of those who utter them, may be expected to

give a corresponding influence to reason, as opposed to passion, in the affairs of a

population so placed.
   That the high and increasing value of life in England indicates a large and increa-

sing proportion of matured minds; and undoubtedly has a corresponding influence on

--the exercise of the national will, as well at home as abroad an influence already

traceable in our political history ; and that there is no apparent reason why municipal
action should not be influenced by the same causes.

   " The land" is the elementary basis of all civilized industry; and the desire to
possess this kind of capital is so universal, as almost to influence mankind every-

where like an instinct.
   The reasonable gratification of this urgent desire demands a more easy commerce

in land than we have as yet attained to.
   The facihties given by "The Encumbered Estates" sales have led the way in this

good change ; and the extension of that law to properties not encumbered, indicates
courage in the progress towards a real free-trade in land which is greatly encouraging

and hope-inspiring. If land could be bought and sold in lots of all suitable sizes,

several vague inventions proposed for giving either a factitious, or an arbitrary pos-
session of the soil, would be rendered unnecessary. " Tenant-right," as yet an unread
riddle, would be left in its impracticability, and real possessions made by cash pur-

chases would be a solid, and not a visionary landownership.

The excessive emigration of our people has been induced because our agricultural

population cannot buy small lots of land at home ; the result is, that savings gathered

with much denial at home, are invested in small piuxhases of "real estate" in

WeCanada and elsewhere abroad.                   want a yeoman class of contented settlers in

Ireland, and might soon have them if land were sold in small parcels without dif-

ficulty, and only for cash.
   The writer suggests the construction of a " land-market " for retail-land sales, one

in each of Ireland's four provinces; and that the facilities of these marts be only

afforded to cash purchasers : he thinks land should be sold in parcels of from one acre

upward, as is now done in Canada.
   The author also recommends that " all superior rights, even royalties, should be

sold to purchasers," so as to make owners reoX freeholders ; believing that without
an easily acquired and perfect ownership in the soil, the powers of the people, and

the capabilities of the land, cannot be properly or fully developed.

On the Necessity of Prompt Measures for the Suppression of Intemperance
                and Drimkenness. By James Haughton.

The drinking usages of society cast greater impediments in the way of national

improvement than any other cause which could be named.

That education alone is insufficient to effect the overthrow of intemperance. Dr. Lees'

statistics of 24 counties in England, prove that 12 of these counties, in which large

means of education exist, have more crime than the other 12 in which there are fewer

such facilities. Drinking customs explain the difference. In the first 12 comities

there are 147 public houses, and the crime is 119. In the second, the numbers stand,
58 public houses, 78 crime. In making these calculations a mean is taken for all the
counties in England, and the relative population is taken into account. So much for

the insufficiency of education.

Drinking accumulates from generation to generation. The consumption of whisky

in Ireland during the last century proves this. It increased 90-fold, while the popu-

lation increased but 4-fold.

of national resources.

                  On Agricultural and Manufacturing Industry.

                  By John Pope Hennessy, Inner Temple.

   Having contrasted the views of Adam Smith and those of the modern school of

British economists, with reference to the relative importance of agriculture and manu-
factures, the author proceeded to examine the principles on which the modern econo-
mists rely. Regarding Mr. Senior as a fair and accurate exponent of the modern
school, he made his treatise on 'Political Economy' the groundwork of the memoir.

 --Taking what Mr. Senior calls the fourth elementary proposition, the author stated

it in a threefold form : "(1) Skill and space remaining unaltered; (2) additional
labour employed on land occasions an increase in the produce, (3) but an increase
in a diminishing ratio." The five fundamental terms used in treating the agricultural

--side of the question are, skill, labour, space, produce, and materials. In treating the

manufacturing side of the question, however, he showed that the modern economists
neglected one of these terms, and used another of them with a different signification.

He traced at great length the effect of this omission, and pointed out the anomalous

results to which it has given rise. Applying a general principle, similar to the fourth

--elementary preposition, to both sides of the question, he established the following

conclusions; viz. 1st. that skill and space remaining the same, additional labour
is more efficiently employed in agriculture than in manufactures ; and 2nd, that skill
remaining the same, additional labour and capital are more efficiently employed in

agriculture than in manufactures.
   Having disposed of the theoretical part of the question, the author proceeded to

examine the practical facts which bear upon it. He quoted largely from the statistics

of the growth and prices of cotton in America, and the statistics of the production of
corn in Prussia and in Great Britain. From the statistical tables he exhibited, it

appeared that practical experience completely confirmed the views of Adam Smith,

and was altogether at variance with the opinions of the modern school. The final
result of the memoir consisted of an application of the principles it attempted to

establish to the laws regulating the incidence of taxation.

On the Prevention of Crime. By William H. Jemison, LL.B., Dublin.

The proper object of criminal jurisprudence is the prevention of actions that are

injurious to person or property. Such actions arise from one, or all, of three sources

the smallness of the  offender's means                                                                the weakness  of his moral principle ;  or the
                                                                                                   ;

strength of the inducement. Hence, in order to prevent their occurrence, we must

better the material condition of the lower classes, improve their moral principles,

and diminish the inducement to crime by the intervention of punishment. The

material condition of the lower classes is promoted by diffusing intelligence and pru-

dence ; by the duties of the wealthy and educated being properly performed ; by
useful public institutions ; and by freedom for industry and security for its fruits.

Secondly. Crimes that arise from deficiency of moral principle, will decrease with

the spread of religion and morality. Lastly. Effective punishment must partake of

three characteristics : its nature, and the liability to it, must be properly made known;

its connexion with the offence must be felt as certain ; and its severity must be such
as to outweigh the advantage expected from crime. The first-named characteristic

is inconsistent with magisterial discretion as to the punishments awarded ; with their
infliction being in any measure conditional on the after-conduct of prisoners ; and
with commuting sentences. Secondly. The certainty of connexion between an offence

and its penal consequences must be attained by securing the detection, conviction,

and real punishment of offenders. Detection is promoted by improvements in our

police system ; and conviction by reforms in our criminal law and its administration.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  163

These reforms will involve a better organization of our legal service, a revision of our
rules of evidence and trial, and the removal of useless technicalities. Thirdly. As we
approach certainty in the matters of detection and conviction, the less need be the
severity of our penal code. This suggests a moral consideration. That amount of
severity is not justifiable which is a set-off against imperfections which we can remove
from our penal legislation.

   In the Reformatory movement of the present day, the great object of criminal law
is overlooked. Lord Brougham, e.g., one of the supporters of the movement, lays
down the proposition, " that all punishment should be conducted mainly with a view
to reforming the offender*." From the laws of our moral nature, however, the prac-
ticability of this system must be very doubtful. But its grand error is, that it mis-
takes its proper object. The inculcation of moral lessons to reform convicts, and the
infliction of such punishment as will deter others from committing offences, are objects
so widely apart, that they must be reached by far different roads ; and the latter

object, and not the former, is the end of criminal law.
   The Juvenile Reformatories, also, are open to grave objections. Their position is

unnatural, for they seek to discharge parental duties. Their effects too are mis-
chievous, for instead of public attention being directed to such means as will assist
parents in rearing their children, these institutions tend to impress them with the
notion that they shall be relieved, if not from supporting, at least from caring for

their offspring.

  We must, indeed, deprecate immoral tendencies in the arrangements of our gaols;

but the prevention of crime is to be promoted, not by reforming convicts, but by
improving, materially and morally, the mass of the people, and by the detection,

conviction, and punishment of offenders.

   This paper, on the subject of " The Encumbered Estates Commission," was com-
municated, on a day's notice, at the request of several Vice-Presidents of the Statis-
tical Section, and therefore some of the figures could only be considered as proxi-
matively correct ; but the results, which the author had anticipatively sketched at the
Belfast meeting in 1852, and again at Hull in 1853, had been fully verified by the
subsequent success of this remarkable tribunal.

   Number of petitions presented up to this date, 4159 ; number of conveyances
executed, 7105 ; total produce of sales, twenty millions and seven-eighths, of which
about two-thirds, or fourteen millionst, had been distributed. About two million
acres, or nearly a seventh of the available superficies of the island, had fallen under
the hammer of the court ; and over that extent the proprietors were increased in
number about eight and a half-fold. The expenditure on improvements of these new

and solvent landlords constituted the principal cause of the rise in the wages of labour,
which were doubled since the date of the establishment of the Commission. During
the eight years of its continuance, from three to four millions yearly were poured into
reproductive channels over the surface of this impoverished agricultural country, i. e.
 taking into account the capital laid out on the land by purchasers, as well as the

millions set free, that had been locked up in barren mortgages for scores of years. Up

to the end of the legal session of 1 853, the British purchasers were, as to number,

one in twenty-three ; as to total amount of purchase-money, one-sixth. Since that
date, both these proportions had fallen off, and the Irish had now their land market

almost entirely to themselves. However, the fee of upwards of 600,000 acres in

Connaught, or nearly one-sixth of its extent, had been acquired by British puixhasers

and the intermixture of these, and of English and Scotch farmers settled in the far

West, with the native proprietors and their tenantry, tended greatly to improve and
develope the resources of this, the most neglected province in Ireland. The facilities

afforded for sale and transfer, and the vast extent of land thrown into the tenant-

market by the agency of the Commission, has certainly prevented tenant-right agita-

tion from assuming a dangerous agrarian aspect.

In allusion to the ruinous condition of landed property in the famine years, the

author had been examined before the Committee of Peers on the subject of the labour-

rate debt, and stated, from his personal knowledge, that long before the evidence was
closed, the British Peers on the Committee had resolved unanimously to recommend

a remission of the debt. They merited our gratitude; for had it been enforced, a

vastly greater number of our landlords would have been ruined, by their estates being

forced into a depreciated market during the panic that succeeded the famine.

Registration of title by map was strongly urged on the consideration of the Section,

as a necessary complement to the completeness of a great land-sale tribunal ; and the

author quoted, in support of that proposition, a portion of his own evidence before

Athe " Registration of Title Commission."  map, correctly executed, under careful

supervision, spoke a more clear and definite language than even the wording of the

abstract. The Ordnance Survey was available as an auxiliary, and the instrumenta-

lity might be applied, through means of the machinery of the Encumbei'ed Estates
Court itself, at a small additional cost. Had this plan been adopted, the titles to

nearly one-seventh of the country would now have been in a forward process of

registration by map.

The Encumbered Estates Act had effected the most extensive and salutary revolu-

tion which had ever occurred in Ireland, and that too without exciting one angry

international feeling. But its beneficial results were mainly extrinsic of the condition

as to property being encumbered ; and the principles upon which it was constituted
ought not to be exceptionally applied. In short, both at home and in our dependen-

cies, the liberation of real property from unnecessary legal delays and restrictions,

combined with the facility of its sale and transfer, would increase, beyond calculation,

both the security and prosperity of the British empire.

The author stated, in conclusion, that the progressive improvements in the sales

were in great part attributable to the prudence and cleverness of the conducting soli-

citors ; but that the success of the Commission itself was due to the zeal and ability
of the Commissioners, especially the late Chief-Commissioner, Baron Richards, witli

whose name were indissolubly connected the benefits conferred upon Ireland by a

tribunal which that learned judge so efficiently organized and so indefatigably worked

in its earlier stage of difficulties and unpopularity.

             Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages in Ireland.

                         By Arthur Moore, 3I.B.A.

    After some preliminary observations as to the uses and importance of a general
registration of births, deaths and marriages, the author described the systems in use
in England and Scotland, and their results ; and adverted to the anomaly of Ireland
being the only part of the United Kingdom, and almost the only country in Europe,

without such a registration. He observed that the object of his paper was not so

much to dwell on the value of the registration or on the above anomaly, as to invite
attention to the subject and discussion of it, with a view to consider the means of
supplying the want and to show the practicability of doing so.

    Jn Ireland there is no registration whatever of births and deaths, and but a very
limited registration of marriages under the Irish Marriage Registration Act of 1844,

which however does not include the bulk of the population, the Roman Catholics.
   The author proposes to remove this exclusion of Roman Catholics from the advan-

tage of registration, by including their marriages in a general and uniform registration
corresponding with that of all other of Her Majesty's subjects in the United Kingdom

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

and he contends that this may be done without offending any religious convictions
of any class of the community. The Roman Catholics, like others, are already regis-
tered in England and Wales and Scotland. The registry of the Roman Catholic
marriages would be made by the Roman Catholic clergy by whom the marriages are
solemnized, and by whom they would continue to be solemnized as at present : the
registry of other than Roman Catholic marriages is already provided for and would

not be disturbed.

   For the registration of births and deaths in Ireland, the author proposed to make
use of the Poor Law organization established throughout the country, and especially
the system of dispensary districts and medical officers now spread all over the whole
country in connexion with that organization. He exhibited a map showing the distribu-
tion and arrangement of the Union districts, which he would adopt for the chief or
superintendent registrar's districts, and which would be subdivided by the Guardians
into smaller or registrars' districts, for the registration of births and deaths, by a regis-
trar to be appointed for each by the Guardians of the Union district. He dwelt upon

the importance of securing the cooperation of the medical profession in this registra-

tion, and of obtaining qualified registrars.
   The register of books of births, deaths and marriages, as they became filled, would

be deposited and open to searches in the office of the superintendent registrar of the
Union district; and certified copies of the entries therein would be made every three
months for transmission to a general register-office in Dublin, where they would be
indexed and open to searches: and means would thus be afforded of access to the

registers of all births, deaths and marriages occurring throughout Ireland. An annual
summary and report to be made by the Registrar-General <ind laid before Parliament.

   The author's estimate of the expense of establishing the system proposed, amounted
to about £31,586, of which £11,887 would be paid out of the public funds, and about
£19,699 out of the local rates. These amounts are about one-third of the cost for
England, where the total expense is about £92,000 per annum, of which £27,000 is
paid out of the funds of the state, and £65,000 out of local rates. The annual cost
of the central office for England is £18,000; that for Ireland would be £6900, being
only one-third more for the general registration of births, deaths and marriages, than

the present cost (nearly £4000) of the central office for the registration of a small
portion of marriages only. The estimate for Ireland is at the rate of a farthing and
seven-tenths of a farthing per head on the population, for the charge on the public

funds of the state ; and one farthing and six-tenths of a farthing on the Poor Law

valuation for the charge on the local rates. But the author suggests that the whole
of these expenses, for an object of so great and general importance, and one of national
rather than local concern, might fairly be charged upon the funds of the state. If

that were done for Ireland, it would be equally right that it should be done for the

other portions of the United Kingdom. He had, however, followed the existing pre-

cedents in this respect, both in his calculations and in the draft of a Bill which he
prepared and submitted to the Government in the summer of last year (1856), for
carrying out in detail the plan of which his paper gave a general outline.

          Reasons for extending Limited Liability to Joint-Stock Banks.

                            By Joseph J. Murphy.

   It was argued in this paper, that could banking companies of limited liability be
established anywhere with perfect facility, the country would be covered with banks,
and the small towns and rural districts would be enabled to enjoy those advantages
of accommodation from banks having their head-quarters on the spot, which at pre-
sent are confined to great commercial centres.
--166 REPORT 1857.

It was also argued that if banks had limited liability, a large proportion of those

who are  now depositors would  become shai-eholders                                                                                              the proportion of share capital
                                                                                                                                              ;

to deposits would be increased, and the banks would be sounder and safer.

For the purpose of security, it was urged that directors ought to be under unlimited

liability ; and that auditors elected by the shareholders should have full powers of

investigation.

These suggestions apply to what is properly banking. With respect to the issue

of notes, it was proposed, that should Parliament decide on its increase, any party
should be permitted to issue notes against bullion and securities ; but that companies

should not be permitted to issue notes to a greater extent than their paid-up capital.

   It was also suggested that the State ought to withdraw its account from the Bank
of England and keep its own cash partly for the purpose of doing the work more

                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

cheaply, and partly in order to dispel the false notion that the Bank of England is

somehow a department of State.

On the Recent Legislation relative to Joint-Stock Companies and Joint- Stock
                      Banks. By W. Newmarch, F.S.S.

   The author began by a historical outline of the subject. Joint-stock companies are
unknown to the common law ; but the clear necessity of the case enabled many com-
panies to obtain charters of incorporation, for railway and other purposes, from Par-
liament in some cases, and from the Crown in others.

    In 1844 an Act of Parliament was passed for the purpose of regulating the incor-
poration and working of joint-stock companies, both for banking and for other purposes.
This made the granting of charters of incorporation dependent on the discretion of
the Board of Trade, and provided a very elaborate administrative system for their

regulation. It did not touch the question of limited liability, which, until 1856, could

be conferred only by Parliament. The administrative system thus provided did not
work satisfactorily ; it was too complex, and gave the public a false idea of security,
which, in many well-known unhappy cases, proved not to be well-founded.

   In 1856 the well-known Joint-Stock Companies' Act was passed. A great mass

of complications was got rid of on that occasion, by laying down the principle, un-
known to the common law, but necessary at the present time, that incorporation is
not a favour but a right ; and, consistently with that principle, but unlike the Act of
1844, the administrative machinery it provided for the purpose of registration, publi-
city, &c., is extremely simple. The Act of 1856 also empowered companies to con-
stitute themselves with the privilege of limited liability. It did not affect banks

which remain under the operation of previous acts, nor insurance companies, which,
from the nature of their business, are able to protect themselves against the common-
law operation of unlimited liability by treating every policy as a separate contract and
inserting therein a clause limiting their liability. Thus the question stands at present.

   The author thinks the settlement of the general question of limited liability quite
satisfactory, owing both to the fairness of the principle and to the simplicity of the
machinery ; but is inclined to hesitate about its extension to banking companies, in
consequence of the important difference between companies which trade on their own
moneys, such as railway and manufacturing companies, and those which, like banks,
trade in great part on the money of others. It is perhaps reasonable to attach a more
stringent responsibility to the latter than to the former. At the same time the author
desires to reserve to himself full liberty of considering any new facts as regards th^

extension of limited liability to banks.

While a large portion of the labour employed in this industry depends on Ireland,

the chief seat of the manufacture is in Glasgow ; there are thirty-five to forty manu-
facturing houses in Glasgow ; one or two in Paisley ; and about a dozen in the north

of Ireland.

   The gross value of the sewed muslin manufacture of Scotland and Ireland last year
amounted to a little above or below a million sterling. There were employed in it
2200 weavers, 450 pattern printers and pressmen, 200 designers and salesmen, and

3680 females occupied within the warehouse doors in the various manipulations ot
sewing, darning, ironing, making-up, &c. ; while in the work of embroidery itself,
there might be 200,000 females employed in Ireland and 25,000 in Scotland. The

annual amount of these, according to the average rate of weekly wages paid to such

parties, is as follows :

                                           Per annum.

                                                                                                           .£675,513

   Adding to this the cost of labour in spinning the yarn for the muslin and the cotton
for the embroidery, in bleaching the goods, in making the fancy-paper boxes, baskets,
&c. in which the finished goods are packed, it will not be too much to assume that
the embroidered muslin manufacturer pays for labour a sum little short of £700,000
a year. The truth is, among tlie many industries of Great Britain, there are ievi into
which labour enters more deeply than the muslin embroidery manufacture, and in

which the labouring classes have a deeper interest.

 On the Advantages arising from the Improvement of Tidal Rivers as

down water in floods to the extent of 33,885 cubic feet per second, it remained in a
state of nature till 17G8, having only about 2 feet depth of water. By different
engineering appliances it has been rendered navigable for vessels drawing 20 feet of
water. This has been accomplished, first, by placing jetties on its sides, whereby
to contract the stream and cause it to deepen itself by its own flow and scour

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

this obtained a depth of 8 feet ; secondly, by connecting these jetties by half-tide
parallel dykes, a depth of 10 feet, and thereafter by raising them to full-tide dykes, a
depth of 11^ feet; thirdly, by the combined processes of dredging and steam naviga-
tion jjrior to 1839, which augmented the depth to 15 feet ; and, fourthly, by the com-
bined action of the dykes, deepening machines, and steam-boat traffic, an artificial
river has been got at this moment of a depth of 1 8 feet water at neap, and 20 feet at
spring tide.

    With respect to the harbour of Glasgow, its changes have been equally marked.
In 1800, the whole quay was limited to a few hundred yards ; now it extends to about
two miles and a half, leaving an extent of harbour of upwards of sixty acres. From
these causes the number of vessels arriving at the harbour of Glasgow has increased
from 11,505, with a tonnage of 096,261, in 1828, to 17,960, with a tonnage of
1,612,681, in 1857. While in 1828, there was not a steamer above 100 tons at the
harbour, now such vessels as the ' Persia' of 3600 tons sail down the river. The cost of
the vast improvements made from 1770 to July 1856, has been £2,527,199. The
revenue collected during the same period has been .^1,603,219, the annual revenues
being in 1771, ^1046; in 1857, ^82,797. The debt of the Clyde Trust is about
£92,000, consequently a large portion of what may be called real capital has been
paid out of revenue.

   The following commercial results may be mainly attributed to the improvement of
the Clyde navigation. Before these operations were begun, Glasgow had little or no
trade, whereas in 1 854 the aggregate value of exports from its harbour was £4,905,557.
Previous to 1801 her registered ships were nil; in 1856 they amounted to 563, with
a tonnage of 204,331. Formerly no ships were built on the river ; now thei'e are no

fewer than thirty large ship-building yards, which in 1853-54 constructed no less than
266 vessels, having an aggregate tonnage of 168,000 tons, which, with the marine
engines made during the same period, involved the enormous cost of nearly
^5,000,000 sterling. Previous to the commencement of the river improvements,
Glasgow had only 24,000 inhabitants ; now she can count 420,000, whilst its annual
rental, which in 1750 was only a few thousands, was last year ,^1,319,720, The
improvements on the Clyde have given a most decided impulse to the opening up and
working of the rich fields of minerals by which Glasgow is surrounded, and which
produced in 1855 from coal and iron alone nearly ^4,900,000, and gave employment
to 233,912 persons, who received for their labour wages to the amount of ,1^1,975,919.
So much for Glasgow.

   In a national point of view these improvements have proved equally beneficial. In
1796 the Customs duties levied at Glasgow were only .£125, whereas last year they
amounted to £718,855. In 1781 the revenue of the Glasgow Post-office was only
£4341; in 1856, with a penny postage, it reached £64,958. In one word, while
the taxes paid into the public treasury through the city of Glasgow before the Clyde
improvements commenced were, comparatively speaking, nothing, the various crown
revenues collected there last year reached no less a sum than £2,800,000, or about
jVth part of the whole revenue of the country.

       On the Criminal Statistics of this and certain Foreign Countries.

                          By W. M. Tartt, F.S.S.

   The paper under the above title was a "Report on Criminal Returns," prepared in
conformity with a resolution passed by the Committee of Section F at the Meeting

of the British Association in 1856.

   Its object was to inquire into "the present mode of framing our criminal returns,
and the best means of improving them," with especial reference to the forms adopted
in France and Prussia. During the sittings of the Committee, its attention had fre-
                                                                                                                                                            ;

quently been called to the imperfect character of the materials on which we had long

depended for our criminal statistics ; but improvements v/ere even then being intro-
duced which have anticipated much that might otherwise have been proposed. The

discussions at the meetings of the International Congress, Lord Brougham's speech

Homeon Judicial Statistics, and the newly-established statistical department at the

Office, had already had a practical influence.

As part of the Report, abstracts are given of the Forms of all the retm^ns in use

previous to Michaelmas 1856, of those subsequently introduced, and of some of those

which have been adopted in France and Prussia. Our own (previous to 1856) had

reference to the mere number and nature of the offences and their punishment, rather

than to the character and sources of our criminal population ; and in some of their
details there was a minuteness which had no useful object. The information to be

derived from the police did not form any established part of the particulars required.

It is suggested that in future the information collected from this and other sources

should, in the first    instance, be                                          as comprehensive as  possible                                       but  that, in giving it
                                                                                                                                               ;

an abridged or tabular form, there should be a distinct bearing upon some social or

legislative question, and a generalization of details.

As a minor instance, we are referred to the Table of Ages of Offenders, in which

the present classification is purely arbitrary and unmeaning ; commencing with "under
twelve," to which no significancy can be attached, and afterwards proceeding merely

by decades. Considering that since the reformatory process has been substituted for

punishment, the principle of doli incapax is rarely applied much beyond the age of

eight years, and that sixteen is the limit of jurisdiction under the ' Juvenile Offenders'

Acts,' the  first  period in the classification                               of ages should             be from eight                                      to sixteen
                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

and as the persons who have given most attention to the subject are of opinion that

those who pass beyond twenty-one without the commission of crime, rarely fall into

criminal courses afterwards, the next period should be from sixteen to twenty-five

the next (the passions and temptations being still strong) might be from twenty-five
--to thirty-five
                                                                      ;  in which there are rarely any general causes beyond pre-
                   the  next

--vious bad habits might be from thirty-five to fifty ; and from fifty upwards, the first

commission of crime (at every age which it would include) is the result of accidental

circumstances.     In Prussia                                            the  classification is " under  sixteen                                   sixteen  to twenty-
                                                                                                                                                ;

four; twenty- four to forty; forty to sixty; sixty and upwards." Either of these

arrangements would reduce eight unmeaning divisions (as at present) tofive which have

some significance; and it is suggested that on this principle every return should be made.
   The enumeration of offences might also, it is thought, be much abridged, both in

the returns and in the tables which form so large a portion of the ' Judicial Statistics,

--Part I,' prepared at the Home Office under the able superintendence of Mr. Redgrave.

In Prussia they are classed: " 1. Riot and tumult with acts of violence. 2. Mutinous

risings of prisoners with acts of violence. 3. Coining. 4. Wilful perjury and sub-

ornation of perjury. 5. Offences against decency. 6. Murder. 7. Manslaughter.

8. Infanticide. 9.' Causing miscarriage. 10. Serious bodily injuries. 11. Poisoning.
12. Serious thefts, first offence. 13. Serious theft, repeated offence. 14. Robbery

with force. 15. Forging documents. 16. Fraudulent bankruptcy. 17. Wilful

burnings and other like offences dangerous to the community. 18. Offences

in official situations. 19. Other offences not included in the above." There is similar

brevity and meaning in the Prussian classification of occupations or callings; but here
a good deal must depend upon national character and pursuits; and for ourselves,

perhaps, our own classification is preferable.

From the French returns, it is suggested that we might take with advantage some

notice of the effect of extenuating circumstances admitted by a jury in reducing
punishments. But the point chiefly dwelt upon is the necessity of knowing more
than we learn at present of a prisoner's character and antecedents. In No. I, of the
new tables, the police are required to furnish, "as far as is known," the number of
previous commitments ; and in No. II. the " age, sex and birth-place." The informa-
tion as to previous commitments is, at present, a good deal taken from the statements

made to the chaplains and gaolers by the prisoners themselves, and is therefore little

to be depended upon ; and the birth-place of a prisoner is of less importance than to
ascertain correctly whether the crimes committed in any particular district are by

residents or non-residents. When there is an increase in the former, it is a proof that
170 REPORT-- 1857.

there is something in the social state of the locality which requires to be remedied ; if
in the latter, it is merely a matterfor the police, or probably accidental. The informa-
tion on these points should form part of the police returns, and should be carefully
collected, together with tlie number of times which the offenders have, in each case,
been charged with crimes, whether proceeded against or not ; and if not, for what
reason. With this view a new Table is proposed, in the form annexed.

   To obtain more accurate knowledge as to the criminal classes generally, it might

--be desirable to adopt the Casiers Judiciaires, which have been established in France

since 1851. They are placed in various localities one of them in each judiciary
arrondissement. Notices are there sent and classed, of every sentence of the different
tribunals of the empire (soit du continent, soil des colonies), against any individual
belonging to any part of a district of which the locality where the easier is established
may be considered as the centre. Of these there are 361. If it be wished to ascer-
tain the antecedents of any individual, application is made to the clerk {au greffe du
tribunal de premiere instance), by whom the easier for the district to which the party
belongs, is kept ; and a notice is returned, stating that he either has, or has not, been

Areported as a criminal ; and if reported, how often and under what circumstances.

central ofiRce takes cognizance of foreigners and persons whose birth-place is unknown.
Tiie police find in these establishments one of the most valuable and ready modes of
obtaining information* ; and they appear to be a much more reliable source than the
revelations made, as with us, by the criminal himself in his interviews with the

governor or chaplain.
    It is stated in the Report that the ' Judicial Statistics, Part I.,' prepared at the

Home Office, for 1850, show a continued approach to whatever is most valuable in

the best returns which have hitherto been devised : that for still greater improvements
we shall find the materials in our police offices and courts of petty. sessions ; and that
it is principally from these sources, if carefully and faithfully watched, that we can

derive a better knowledge of the classes whom we have to punish or reclaim. It is

not thought desirable, however, till our arrangements are more perfect, to require
complicated returns either from the prison officers or the police. The great object
should, in the first instance, be to make them reliably correct.

On Statistics of Crime in Ireland, 1842 to 1856. By James Moncrieff

   Wilson, Actuary, Manager of the Patriotic Assurance Company of

    Ireland.

   The state of crime in Ireland, for the period extending from the beginning of 1 842
to the end of ) 856, was analysed so far as to show the classes of crime most prevalent
during their course, a course made up partly of years of prosperity, but chiefly of
years of adversity ; and a more complete analysis was made of the state of crime for
the year 1851, showing the effect of age, sex, locality, education, general occupation,
intemperance and low-class house accommodation upon the amount of crime during

that year.

The following are some of the general conclusions derived from the facts established

in the paper :

1. That the best measure of crime at ])resent available is the computation of the

persons committed or held to bail for trial at the assizes and quarter sessions.

2. That when a person is thus committed or held to bail, the probabilities in favour

of his being convicted are about fifty-six to forty-four.

3. That no inquiry into criminal statistics can be of service unless the proportion of

crime to population is taken into account.

   4. That although it is impossible to state the exact population of Ireland for each

year from 1841 to 1856, that still approximations not very wide of the truth may be
made ; and that in Table A are given about as accurate approximations to the real

population in the different years referred to as could well be arrived at.
   5. That want and privation are fruitful multipliers of all classes of crime, and that

to such a parentage we may safely look first, when we find a general and marked

increase in the crime of a country.

6. Tliat although during the years of distress the tendency to every class of crime

was greatly increased, it was chiefly offences against property, committed without

violence, which swelled the criminal calendar of Ireland.

7. That in the year 1856, the tendency to crime in Ireland was certainly not

greater, and perhaps less than the tendency to crime in England and Wales.

8. That the criminal returns for Ireland are susceptible of very considerable im-

provements, which if made, would greatly add to their value for practical purposes.

   9. That among males the maximum tendency to crime for Ireland generally, and

for each province separately, except Connaught, is at the period of life twenty-one and

above sixteen, and for Connaught at the stage thirty and above twenty-one ; and
among females, for Ireland generally, and for each province separately, at the period
thirt}- and above twenty-one ; and that in both cases the minimum tendency is at the
period twelve and under.

10. That the tendency to crime generally among males is only about two-fifth

times the like tendency among females ; but that were the petty offences against pro-

perty committed without violence to be dropped, the tendency to all other classes
of crime among males would be between four and five times the like tendency among

females.

11. That the tendency to the class of crime termed " Offences against the person,"

attains its minimum among both sexes at the period of life thirty and above twenty-

one                    that the tendency to the classes " Offences against property committed with and
                    ;

without violence," reaches its maximum among females at the same period, but among

males at the earlier stage twenty-one and above sixteen ; that the tendency to the

class " Malicious offences against property," is at its maximum among both sexes

at the stage twenty-one and above sixteen ; and that the tendency to the classes
" Forgery and offences against the currency," and " Offences other than those before

enumerated," is at its maximum also among both sexes at the period thirty and

above twenty- one.

   12. That among both sexes tlie tendency to each separate class of crime is at its
minimum at the period of life twelve and under.

   13. That popular education singly, but especially when combined with occupatioD,

tends powerfully towards the diminution of crime.

14. That the good effects of education and occupation upon crime are very seriously

marred by the abuse of intoxicating drinks.

15. That low-class house accommodation tends towards the increase of crime.
--372 REPORT 1857.

16. That popular education, as a means of diminishing the tendency to crime,

although most useful in so far as both sexes are concerned, has yet much greater effect

among females than among males ; and that is emphatically the case in regard to

four classes of crime,  " Offences against the                                 ;  " Offences against property, com-

                                                person "

mitted without violence ; " " Malicious offences against property ; " and " General

offences," class No. 6.
   17. That ignorance among the masses operates injuriously among the educated and

half-educated classes ; and that, therefore, to educate the ignorant will tend not only

to lessen crime among them, but also among the better classes thus influenced.
    18. That were intoxicating drinks less freely used, education as a means of reducing

crime, would become more powerful.
    19. That the average tendency to the class of crime " Offences against property

committed without violence," is rather more than one-half the average tendency to

crime generally.
    20. That, as without doubt, a large proportion of the serious crimes are committed

by those who in early life may be said to have served an apprenticeship to theft; and
that as this (No. 3) class of offences, at the period of life sixteen and above twelve
among males, amounts to three-fourths of the whole male crime, and among females
to five-sixths of the whole female crime, it follows that by getting reduced at this

period of life such offences, the more serious crimes at later stages of life will also

necessarily be diminished.

   21. That increasing efforts should be made to educate all classes of the youth of
both sexes ; and that instructors ought not to rest satisfied with merely teaching to
read and write ; but that in all our schools industrious habits should be constantly
taught, cleanliness and morality daily enforced, and the danger of indulging to excess

in the use of intoxicating drinks frequently pointed out.

    On the Application of the Decimal Scale in the Construction of Maps.
                       By James Yates, M.A., F.R.S.

   Since the commencement of the present century the various continental nations
have to a great extent adopted the principle of constructing their maps upon a decimal
scale. 1 will briefly notice some of the most remarkable examples that have come to

my knowledge.

    In France, the adoption of this principle is an obvious and even necessary result of
the introduction of the metre as the unit of length. Millimetres, centimetres and deci-
metres are, as a matter of course, made to correspond in maps to kilometres, or other
decimal multiples of themselves, on the surface of the earth.

   Hence one of the results of the annexation of Algeria to France has been the pro-
duction of excellent plans of cities and maps of the whole country, all decimally pro-
jected, and consequently either identical in their scale, or related to one another by
clear and simple proportions*.

    In Belgium this important task has been taken out of the hands of the Government
and admirably executed by M. Van der Maelen, proprietor of the celebrated Geo-

graphical Institute. He has published a general map of Belgium, the scale of which

is 1 to 200,000; and another, the scale of which is 1 to 20,000 (Brussels, 1846), con-
sequently ten times the dimensions of the preceding.

    Sardinia is most honourably prominent in labours of this class. Its Government

advantage of using the metrical system for commerce and other ordinary transactions.
The kingdoms of Bavaria and Wurtemburg and the Electorate of Hesse Cassel,
together with some of the neighbouring duchies, employ the General Staff of each
country in executing maps on the same scale, which is that of 1 to 50,000. Thus the
maps of these several governments fit one another like the dissected maps of our English
counties. There is also a Topographical Atlas of Bavaria, the scale of which is

55^, published in 1843.

   Spain and Portugal have decreed that the metrical system shall after a few years
be exclusively employed for weights and measures in those countries ; so that it must

ere long be employed for the government maps, if it has not been adopted ah-eady.

    It thus appears that the whole of the west of the continent will shortly be described
and delineated in maps and plans adjusted to one another and capable of easy com-

parison, in consequence of being all projected with dimensions decimally related to

the surface of the land.

   Of the scales employed in our own Ordnance Surveys, 1 inch to a mile and 6 inches

to a mile, the former is the 63,360th part of the actual linear distance, the latter is

the 10,560th part. It is very difficult and inconvenient to calculate by either of these

numbers. On the contrary, the decimal method will be found easy in its application

to this as well as all other purposes. Either a metre, or any other measure of length,

which is decimally divided, may be applied to the map, and will show the real

distance from one place to another with the greatest facility. Thus, if the scale be 1 in

10,000, a decimetre on the map will represent a kilometre on the surface of the
ground ; and if it be ith less, or 1 in 50,000, as is the case in many of the maps

which have been mentioned, a kilometre on the surface of the ground will correspond

to two centimetres on the map.

If the decimal scale has advantages as regards the maps of the British Isles, con-

sidered by themselves, still greater benefit will arise when they are to be compared

Wewith maps of the neighbouring territories on the continent.           have already

advanced so far towards uniformity as to sanction one scale for all England and an-

other for all Ireland, and some persons think it would be well to apply the same scale
to the whole of the British Isles. But why should not the principle of uniformity be

carried further? If the decimal scale has great intrinsic advantages, it must be an

additional reason for its application, that it would bring our maps into coincidence

with those of our continental neighbours.

   In England the decimal principle has scarcely been applied at all to the construc-
tion of maps. There is, however, an exception to the universality of this remark in

the case of Mr. W. Hughes, F.R.G.S., whose ' Geological Map of the British Islands'

is projected on a decimal scale, every line and every distance upon it being to the

corresponding distance in nature, as 1 to 2,500,000. Its proportions are consequently

5\;th of the proportions adopted in the national maps of Germany f.

--174 REPORT 1857.

On the Use of Prime Numbers in English Measures, Weights, and Coinage.
                       By James Yates, 3I.A., F.R.S.

   On examining the Tables of the measures, weights, and coins used throughout

England, it is found that the prime numbers used in their composition and of the
most frequent occurrence are 2, 3, and 5, Of these, 2 occurs as a factor by far the
most frequently, indeed twice or thrice as often as either 3 or 5.

   Seven makes its appearance in the following weights and measures :

                                   Avoirdupois Weight.

           7000 grains                                                              =1 lb.
              14 lbs                                                                =1 stone.
              28 lbs                                                                =1 quarter.

                                            Wool Weight.
                        7 lbs.=:l clove, whence 14 lbs.=l stone.

                                             Wine Measure.

42 gallons                                                                          =1 tierce.
63 gallons                                                                          =1 hogshead.

Eleven is used in one case only, but that is an important one, viz. :

                                                  Long Measure.

  Y or 54yards=:l rod or pole, from which isdeduced 4 poles, or 22yards=:rl chain.

The furlong, the mile, and the acre are also multiples of this fundamental number.
    Thirteen also comes in once as a factor, viz. in

                                             Wool Weight.

                  -- or Q\ tods                                                     =1 wey.

   Wool weight is curiously compounded. No less than four primes, 2, 3, 7, 13, are

used as factors, producing only six denominations, which are as follows :

1 clove                                                                             =71bs. avoirdupois.
1 stone
1 tod                                                                               =2 cloves.
                                                                                    =2 stones.
1 wey
                                                                                    =6§ tods or 13 stones.
1 sack                                                                              =2 weys.
1 last                                                                              =12 sacks.

   Only one other prime number requires notice, and that is found in a very conspi-
cuous position, and where, perhaps, it was little to be expected, viz. in a recent Act
of Parliament. The law now in force and known as the Weights and Measures Act,
fixes the number of grains in the lb. avoirdupois by the use of the number 7, and
goes on to determine the relation of the (lound troy to the standard linear measure
by declaring, that a cubic inch of distilled water " is equal to 252 grains and 458

thousandth parts of a grain." If this number (-5^5^) be divided by 2, it will be

found that a cubic inch of water weighs 126-229 five hundredth parts of a grain, the

numerator     ,,    ,.  ,,.        1 26-229  b, e.mg  a                .  numb1er.

   As the result of this analysis, it appears that the primes used in the English mea-

sures, weights, and coins are the following :
                                          2,3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 126-229.

   I propose to offer a few remarks respecting the aptitude of these numbers for the

functions which they are appointed to perform.

   The adoption of them does not appear to have been determined, in any case, so far
as we can judge, by reason or principle, but to have arisen from accidental and arbi-
trary causes. There is no apparent benefit in connecting our highest coins by 2 and
5, the intermediate by 2 and 3, and the lowest by 2 only. No advantage arises from
measuring land by elevens, and weighing wool by sevens and thirteens. No reason
can be assigned why seven should be brought into avoirdupois weight and excluded
from troy weight ; or why 3 should be excluded from avoirdupois weight, whilst it
plays an important part in troy weight and apothecaries' weight. In short, all our
Tables present the appearance of an entire want of principle in their construction.

   The introduction of an additional prime has the effect of making our weights and
--

 measures more complex and multiform. It ought therefore to be avoided, unless
 some necessity can be shown in its favour. Hence it would seem to be expedient to
 abolish from these calculations all primes except 2, 3, and 5 ; and here an important
 question arises, viz. should these be retained, or shall we be satisfied with 2 and 5,

 omitting 3 ?

   We are thus brought to one of the great discussions of the present day, the expe-

 diency of decimalizing our measures, weights and coins.

   The consequence of the simple fact, 2x5=10, is, that all decimal systems are also

binary and quinary, the principal quantities expressed by tens, hundreds, thousands,
&c. being divisible by 2 and by 5 without remainder, so that their doubles and their
halves can be introduced and reckoned without the least difficulty or inconvenience.
 But such systems do not readily admit the number 3, because in the majority of cases
the quantity cannot be divided by 3 without a remainder, and in many cases the

division by 3 produces a repeating decimal. This is the ground on which many

persons have insisted on 12 as a multiplier for measures, weights, and coins, rather
than 10. But it is to be observed, that if 10 cannot be divided by 3, on the other
hand 12 cannot be divided by 5 without remainder. Hence it seems to follow, that
the choice must be made between decimal and duodecimal modes of computation,
according as a preference is given to 3 or to 5 as a divisor. If it is more necessary
or convenient to divide by 3 than by 5, duodecimal methods are entitled to the pre-
ference, so far as this circumstance is concerned. I cannot, however, discover any
reason for making this assumption. I think it probable, that division by 5 is required
as frequently as by 3, whilst every other consideration is decidedly in favour of the

decimal scale.

   The investigation which we have been pursuing is, therefore, first, in favour of de-
cimal measures, weights, and coins ; and secondly, supports the views of those who
think that the subordinate multiples and divisions should be made by 2 and 5 only,
and not by 3.

   In this conclusion I have the satisfaction to observe that I am countenanced by

the authority of the late Mr. Drinkwater Bethune, one of the Commissioners appointed
by the present Lord Monteagle, when Chancellor of the Exchequer, to consider the
steps to be taken for restoring the standards of weight and measure. In his letter to
the Chancellor of the Exchequer, dated 21st of September, 1841, he maintains the

following positions :

   1st. That " the Tables of Weights and Measures now in use are complex and in-
convenient, and that it is very desirable to get rid of inconvenient multiples such as
the factor 7, which connects the pound avoirdupois with the stone, and thereby with
its multiples, the hundredweight and ton; and the factor 11, which connects the yard
with the chain, and thereby with the mile and acre."

   2nd. That " it is desirable, that no numbers, which are not multiples either of 2 or
of 5, should anywhere appear in the Tables."

            Address by Lord Rosse, the President of the Section.

Lord Rosse commenced by apologizing for any oversight he might commit, as he
had never at any previous Meeting of the British Association presided over the
Mechanical Section. He was happy, however, that there could be no danger of serious
errors on his part, as there were able men on both sides of him who had made Civil

Engineering their special study. He proceeded to say that the question had some-
times been asked why a Mechanical Section was necessary might not all mechanical

questions be conveniently discussed in the Mathematical and Physical Section? To
that question, on some occasions, an answer has been returned. It may at once be

said, that it has been found eminently useful to have separate Sections for each di-
stinct department. It is only under such an arrangement that discussion can be really

effective in bringing out new truths. If a considerable portion of the Section is not
intimately acquainted with the subject in all its details, what prospect can there be of
176 REPORT 1857.

new and sound views being elicited; and indeed if the whole Section has not some

general knowledge of the branch of science which has been committed to its care,

what hope can there be that discussions will be heard with interest, and will have

real efficiency in awakening and strengthening a taste for science? This has been

felt, indeed strongly felt, at the Royal Society, where there are no Sections, and the

subjects are of a very varied nature, comprehending the whole range of the Mathe-

Amatical and Physical Sciences, and all the Natural Sciences. paper perhaps is read

on Pure Mathematics : very possibly there may not be in the room at the time more

than two or three persons who are intimately acquainted with that branch of science :

Aa discussion of course is out of the question.  paper follows on one of the Natiu'al

Sciences : if there are a few who are working in that direction a discussion takes

place; but it is of little interest even to those engaged in other branches of Natural

Science ; and almost, if not altogether without interest to the Mathematician, the

Chemist, the Astronomer, the Geologist, and the Physicist. So it rarely happens

that there is a discussion at the Meetings of the Royal Society, of general interest or

of real value; and for that there is no remedj*. Here, by the happy expedient of

breaking up the Association into separate Sections, the way has been prepared for dis-

cussing subjects in that eflective manner which, originating with the Geological

Society, has already so nmch advanced geological science.

   Where one of the great objects of these meetings is to elicit truth by discussion, it
is evident how unwise it would be to group together in one Section a variety of sub-

jects, each requiring special studies, a special line of thinking, and special experiences.

In Section A, human ingenuity and human knowledge are employed in the solution

of mathematical and physical problems ; while in Section G, human ingenuity and
human knowledge, but of a different kind, are employed in the solution of questions

of practical engineering. This may so far perhaps be considered, in one sense at
least, a sufficient answer to the question, why is a Mechanical Section necessary ?
The question, however, may be put in another sense. Where the investigations are

not abstract, but practical, and where the results generally are of immediate interest,

is it necessary that the British Association should interfere at all ? Will not private

individuals, from motives of self-interest, devote themselves to the pursuit of Civil

Engineering in its higher branches, without any adventitious stimulus ? Will not

public men, seeing that the interests of the State, both in peace and war, are bound

up with the full development of the resources of engineering, make it their business

to acquire such a general knowledge of the subject as will enable them to ascertain

when and where to apply for aid in time of difficulty ? The reverse unfortunately is

the case ; experience has shown that men, whether in their pi'ivate or public capacity,

do not act in these matters exactly as we should expect ; they do require both to be

aided and ui'ged forward.

In this eminently practical countrj', private individuals, very often relying on ex-

perience, neglect the means nscessary to render calculation effective. Experience,

however, is not always at hand, and is often very costly. How often do we see the

ingenious mechanic working on false principles, vainly perhaps attempting to accom-

plish something which a little elementary knowledge would have shown to be impos-

sible 1 There are perhaps few gentlemen present who could not point out instances

·where individuals had sustained heavy losses from the want of adequate theoretical

knowledge. In his limited experience he had known several. This perhaps is a

striking one. Some years ago he was invited by a physician of eminence in London

to visit the works of an ingenious mechanic, who was endeavouring to employ air

heated by gas as a prime mover. The physician had embarked £12,000 in the pro-

ject ; a lady of wealth had speculated in it to the extent of £30,000; and various
individuals had advanced sums altogether to a large amount. At the entrance of the

premises there was the wreck of a gigantic machine of unknown construction : other

machines in a dilapidated state were lying about in all directions. It appeared from

the explanation of the mechanic, that these huge masses of ruined machinery had

been constructed partly for the purpose of ascertaining facts to be found in every ele-

mentary treatise, and partly for the accomplishment of objects manifestly impossible.

In the construction of the engine itself there was a striking display of great ingenuity

constantly engaged in a struggle with the laws of nature. It was perfectly evident

that the whole was fated to end in disappointment ; still the mechanic and his patrons,

undismayed by repeated failures, and heedless of warnings, which, where there was

no science, were without force, struggled on till the project came to an end from

exhaustion. Some of the parties were ruined, while all lost the capital they had

embarked in the speculation.

One of the objects of the Mechanical Section is to prevent such disasters, and no

doubt to a certain extent this has been effected. Another object has been effected

also : the importance of engineering science in the service of the State has been brought

more prominently forward. There seems, however, something still wanting. Sciencfe

may yet do more for the navy and army, if more called upon.

  A few years ago, in sailing through the harbour of Portsmouth, as the boat pro-

ceeded along, the sailors gave a little history of each ship laid up there ; they said.

That ship has been but once at sea, and it rolled so it was almost impossible to keep

masts in her ; she is not likely to go to sea again. There is another ship which sails

so badly that she can neither chase nor run away. There is a ship which can scarcely

beat to windward, and if it was blowing hard upon a lee-shore, she would have but little

chance. Other ships had other defects. Strange uncertainty : who could avoid asking

the question, is naval architecture really guided by science ? About that time a little

book came out which solved the mystery. It is called ' Lectures on the results of

the Gi'eat Exhibition :                                                                                                                                                             the lectures are by first-rale men.  In it there is a lecture by

Captain Washington, " On the Progress of Naval Architecture," an officer of high

scientific attainments, now Hydrographer to the Admiralty. After mentioning the

well-known historic fact, that during the late great war our best ships were copies,

and not always very successful ones, of foreign models, he proceeds to say, that all

who served in the blockading fleets were painfully alive to the fact that our ships

were inferior to those of France and Spain in speed, stability, and readiness in man-

oeuvring. That much loss of life might have been spared if our ships had been in

form more on a par with those of our opponents. He attributes theii- inferiority tb

the fact, that while in France and Spain, and other continental countries, the aid of
science had been called in, and the greatest northei'u nations had turned their atten-

tion to ship-building, the only English treatise at all of a scientific character was

published by Mungo Murray, who died a working shipwright. That England has not

have carried all before it. Inventions, however, do not come forth at our bidding

the science of war? Have we never heard a whisper of official prejudices and oflicial

discouragement? Moreover, if you invent, the invention soon falls into the hands of

a vigilant enemy and you have achieved nothing.

It was not by little inventions that the engineering powers of England could have

been brought to bear effectually in the late war. If, when war was imminent, civil

engineers had been consulted in conjunction with military engineers and naval men,
means perhaps would have been found by which the gigantic engineering resources

of this country would have been rendered available. It was going a little too far when

it was said that Cronstadt could have been taken by contract. Of this, however, there

could have been no doubt, that a certain thickness of wrought iron would have resisted

the heaviest ordnance then in use ; that the sea could have carried the weight ; and

that no stone walls could have long resisted the close fire of large guns. Moreover,
there were actually French experiments made a few year.s before, which, in the absence
of new experiments, would have afforded tolerably accurate data for the necessary

calculations.

    Let it not be said that engineering science was almost powerless in the late war,

--till it can be shown that it had a fair trial, that its aid had been called for at a proper

time and in a proper manner.

   It is scarcely necessary further to insist upon the importance of the Mechanical
Section. It is obviously the interest of public men, no less than of private individuals,
to pay increased attention to Mechanical Science. If this Section can contribute ever
so little to bring out new facts, or to direct attention to facts already known, it will
have rendered good service.

A detailed Model of the JBai/m Viaduct which carries the Belfast Junction

   Railway over the River Boyne at Drogheda, with a description of it, and

  the Principles of its Construction. By James Barton, C.E.

  --The dimensions of this work are, height above high water, 90 feet to soffit of bridge;

open of centre span, 264 feet ; of side spans, 140 ; besides fifteen stone arches of 61 feet
span each. Tlie three centre spans are crossed by wrought-iron lattice beams designed
by the author; and the chief feature of interest connected with this work is the mode
in which the results of careful investigation of the strains on every bar and plate have
been practically applied. Having ascertained the maxima strains, whether tensile or
compressive, that each bar could be subjected to by the weight of the structure, com-
bined with the passing load entire or in part, the areas of iron and the form of the
parts were then designed and made proportionate to rheir maxima strains ; the limit
assumed being that no part should ever be subjected to more than 4 tons per inch of
iron of compressive, and 5 tons per inch of tensile strain, and that the parts under
compressive strain should be so an-anged and braced that they should not yield by

flexure.

   The three spans are crossed by a continuous beam ; and the author explained how
this arrangement, whilst it was economical and decreased deflection, involved much
more complicated calculation. He showed when the points near the top and bottom
of the beams, called the points of inflection, were under different states of the load, and
how these points travelled along as the load passed over, these points being points at
which there is no strain of either tension or compression, the top and bottom on

either side of these points being under opposite kinds of strain.
   The iron used for this structure was much less than ever the same spans had been

crossed with before by any Girder Bridge, and was at the same time as strong as any.
The total iron used was 740 tons, and the cost complete was about £24 10s. per ton
as it stands, exclusive of scaffolding below the ironwork. The iron was from Staf-
fordshire ; that subject to a tensile strain, of the quality known as " ie,?< best;" that
only subject to compression, of the quality termed "best iron." The correctness of
the calculations, had been proved in some remarkable ways : the points where theo-
retically there should be no strain in the top under a uniform load having been deter-
mined for the large span of 264 feet, the author, after the bridge was relieved of its
supports, severed the top of the main beam in these places, and the strict mainte-

nance of equilibrium in the structure proved that no strain was then passing through
the open joints of the ironwork. Again, it was calculated that when a load of 2 tons
per foot forward would be put upon the centre span, in addition to its own weight,

the points of inflection of the side spans would pass the ends of the beams, the result

of which would be that the side spans ought not to rest any longer on the abutments

of masonry, but stand out as overhanging beams from the piers between them and the

centre span.  This actually took  place                           and when the  centre span was thus loaded,
                                                               ;

the ends of the side spans were found to have lifted 1 inch off their bed plates and

rollers; nor did they descend until a locomotive from tl;e centre span travelling along
the side span from the centre came within about 40 feet of the end. The bridge had
been tested with 1100 tons and in a variety of ways, and the results were most satis-

       On Improvements in Ordnance, By Captain Blakeley, R.A.

   A 16-inch shot would present but 16 times the surface to the action of the air (to

retard it, or make its flight inaccurate) as a 4-inch shot, and would weigh 64 times as
much ; it would therefore be retarded and blown out of its course but ^f , or } as much.

   A gun four times as accurate as a 9-pounder, and with the immense range due to

Athe less resistance of the air, would be a powerful weapon on board fast steamers.

few 30-inch shell guns would be useful in war, and really conducive to peace if placed
on the banks of the Thames, the Clyde or the Mersey. If any foreign power quarrels
with us and suddenly appears with thirty or forty gun-boats armed with one monster
gun each, he could destroy Portsmouth. None who know Mr. Armstrong's applica-
tion of hydraulic power will doubt its adaptability to move guns of any size, and

with little human labour. Large guns require more strength than small ones, as the
powder occupying in each the same proportional f?pace, the small shot moves in say
34(7 of a second a certain number of inches, the large shot in the same time moving
fewer inches, so that at the end of that time the gas in the small gun would have
much more proportionate room to expand in, and would therefore press less on the
gun than in the large one. Added to this, the large shot would require more time to
get its velocity, and the pressure must remain on the gun so much longer. May not
the time a material can bear a tension be an element worthy of experiment ; and may

not cast iron bear a pressure during r,^^ of a second, which if continued during half a
second would destroy it? I believe the sudden and short strain caused by the explo-
sion of gunpowder to be less, not more injurious, as is generally thought, than an
equal strain applied gradually but left longer. However, a 32-pounder is the limit of

cast-iron guns of the present shape, any lai-ger than that being unsafe with full charges.
Adding thickness to the metal would give little additional strength. Professor Bar-
low calculates that a cylinder one inch thick, and one inch in internal diameter when

strained, stretches only ^ as much in proportion outside as inside, the cross section
remaining equal, so that the interior diameter being stretched to 1 X i oVo> ^^'^^ exterior,

instead of becoming 3x xoW (^^ i' would if the outside layer "put out" an equal

strength to the inner, according to the law " ut tensio sic vis"), becomes only 3+-^

of Woo or 3-1-^Vo- The cross section being (3-f-^oW)'=9+5^o »"""« (1+toVo)'

= l+-5^> tlis difference, 8 round inches, being the same as when not strained, or

(3=-- P).
   Jfwith the present tkicJcness the outside docs but § its duty, ive can expect hut little

additional strength from adding to it ; Professor Barlow arguing that the strength
decreases as the squares of the distances from the centre. The same law puts a limit

to the size of brass or cast steel guns, or of wrought iron if in one welded mass.

   I would suggest for guns up to 10 inches a shape very like the present, but the

outside at the breech strengthened with two layers of thin wrought-iron cylinders put
on very hot, and hammered so that the outside shall be fully strained when the gun
is fixed. One I made so stood 605 rounds, all with double charge, and the last 158
rounds loaded to the muzzle. This is evidently greater strength than is required for
anything under 10-inch guns. Above that, I think, with a cast-iron cylindrical centre,
that either rod-iron wound round at a great heat and welded, layer over layer, but
each in cooling taking a permanent strain, or else iron wire wound round it, each
layer having a greater initial strain than the one under it, would be the best way : we

thus get all the fibre in one direction.

   Mr. Armstrong of Newcastle made a gun of a solid steel centre, with bar iron
coiled round it and welded. This gun has stood some thousands of rounds. I dis-
covered early in 1855 that Mr. J. Longridge, C.E., agreed very nearly with me in
opinion, having arrived quite independently at his conclusions, and since then we

have been working together. I exhibit some brass cylinders strengthened with wire,
which he experimented on ; the strain cannot have been under 56 tons per inch on
some of these, reckoning brass and wire, or at least 70 tons an inch on the wire, as
there the strength lay. This would make very serviceable field howitzers; such

howitzers need not weigh over 8 cwt.
    If we do not possess the most efficacious weapons possible, we shall find ourselves

overpowered some day. Any foreign power could secretly prepare a flotilla of gun-

boats, and manufacture the large guns to destroy our fleets and seaports immediately

after a declaration of war.

                   On the Worhi7ig and Ventilation of Coal Mines.
                               By John Brakenridge.

    It was recommended, that instead of commencing to get coal when the straight-
works and board-gates were only partially completed, coal-owners should drive the
board-gates to a cross heading at, or nearly at, the extent to which it might be pro-
posed to work and draw the coal by the same engines and pits, and that the upcast
pit should be sunk, and the furnaces for creating a draft placed at the highest point
in the bed of coal. Then that from this cross heading the coal should be got in the
opposite direction, i. e. toward the downcast pit, instead of from it as at present,
and thus the danger would be greatly abated.

   By such mode of working, the ventilation would be more natural ; a considerable
portion of the gases would he liberated and discharged from the coal before the wide
works in the banks were begun, and the current of the gases as they exude from
the coal or the roof would be upwards from the men and towards the upcast pit, by
which they would make their escape ; the whole mine would then be less liable to be-
come inflammable and explode.

   All the precautions practised in the present mode of woi-king would be necessary
in this, but in a less degree, and the safety of the mine would depend less upon
them ; and should an explosion unfortunately happen, it would be behind the men,
and the force of it would be towards the upcast pit, giving the men the almost cer-
tainty of escape towards the drawing pit, through the passages in the solid coal. The
sacrifice of human lives, as well as much of the damage to the mine, would therefore
be in a great measure averted.

  A Plan for Diminishing the Strain on the Atlantic Cable by an Elastic

                   Regulator. By C. Brooke, M.A., F.R.S.

   The proposed plan consists in suspending a block with one sheave of the same size
as the paying wheels by a bundle of parallel cords of vulcanized india-rubber from a
boom rigged to the mast. This elastic bundle should be of sufficient length and
thickness to elongate 10 or 12 feet, by an increase of strain from perhaps four to six
tons ; and should be placed vertically over one of the pairs of paying wheels, and the
cable move through it between the wheels. As the cable is double, the bundle will
be required to bear twice the strain of the cable. By this arrangement, from 20 to
24 feet of cable would be given out by an increase of tension of from two to three
tons, and taken up again as soon as the tension is diminished.

On Controlling the Movements of ordinary Clocks by Galvanic Currents.
                            ByJouyi Hartnup, F.R.A.S.

    Since the application of electricity to the purposes of the telegraph, various methods

have been had recourse to for working clocks at dislant stations by a normal clock at

an  observatory                                                       or  by causing one  clock  in  a  large  establishment                                                                                                       to work  several

mical observations, or by the transmission of time signals fioni an observatory, must
be admitted to be great ; but those who have had much practical experience in the
matter are aware of the serious drawback, which in spite of every precaution will
occasionally arise, from failure in the galvanic current, and which necessarily causes
all the sympathetic clocks to stop. The members of the British Association for the
Advancement of Science will be gratified to hear of an invention, which sacrifices
nothing in point of accuracy, and which is nevertheless perfectly exempt from the

objection to which we have alluded.
   For the discovery of this simple and very beautiful method we are indebted to Mr.

R, L. Jones of Chester, and the first application of it to a large public clock was to

that of the Liverpool Town Hall. This clock being appealed to by the merchants on
Change as the standard of time, had subjected them to great inconvenience by its
irregular performance, and at my recommendation the plan of Mr. Jones has been
adopted with perfect success. The clock in its present state, with the improvements

which have been made, differs in no respect from an ordinary old turret clock, except
that the pendulum-bob is a hollow electro-magnetic coil which passes around perma-
nent magnets at each oscillation. At each transmission of a current from our normal
clock at the observatory the coil itself becomes a magnet, and the attraction or re-
pulsion between it and the permanent magnet prevents the pendulum from oscillating
except in .strict conformity with the pendulum at the observatory. The wire which con-
nects the Town Hall clock with the clock at the observatory is about one mile in length,
and the controlling power is so great that a single cell of a Smee's battery charged with

very weak acid is sufficient to control the movements of the Town Hall clock, even
when the pendulum is lengthened or shortened so as to make it lose or gain several
minutes a day when not under the control of the clock at the observatory. In prac-
tice, howevei-, the pendulum is regulated to correct time as near as possible, so that

in the event of the current faihng, the clock will not only continue to go, but it is
liable to the errors only of an ordinary clock, and as an error so small even as a

fraction of a second is sufficient to show that the current is not controlling or acting,
the fault may be detected and the remedy applied before the public are subjected to

any inconvenience.
   By this method, therefore, it is quite practicable to make all the public clocks in a

town, or any number of clocks in a large building, strike, or keep the same time to a
fraction of a second, without the risk of inconvenience by failure of the electric cur-
rent, since all the clocks would go as ordinary clocks should the current fail. This

method of controlling the pendulum of a large public clock has been in operation at
Liverpool for several months past, and the public have an opportunity each hour of
the day of witnessing the efficiency of the method. In the office window of the Mag-
netic Telegraph Company, which is within a few yards of the Liverpool Town Hall,

there is a sympathetic seconds clock, the face of which is exhibited to the public.
This clock is worked by our normal clock at the observatory, and as the seconds
hand, at the end of each hour, falls upon the sixtieth second, the first blow of the

hammer of the Town Hall clock breaks upon the ear, much to the admiration and
astonishment of a large number of persons who congregate daily to witness this novel

performance.

   The normal clock at the observatory is an ordinary astronomical clock, the con-

tact springs of which are so slight as not to interfere sersibly with its performance.

It will therefore be seen, that by placing a good astron?' deal clock in any building,

a turret or any number of clocks may be connected and their movements controlled
by it, and a degree of accuracy secured which has hitherto not been attained.

  On the Use of Percussion Lights for preventing Collisions at Sea and on

                     Hailways. By Captain Leach, B.E.

   Tlie author introduced the subject by adverting to the fearful loss of life and pro-
perty which annually occurs from collisions at sea; and to the well-known fact that
these collisions e6tiera|ly ai;is§ from the want of a proper look-out on board one or

other of the vessels ; and alluded also to several recent cases of collision, in Avhich it
was subsequently shown that one of the vessels had seen the other in sufficient time,
and at a sufficient distance, to have averted the calamity had the means been at hand
of instantly giving warninsr of the danger in such a manner as to have attracted the

attention of the people on board the approaching ship.

   Captain Leach suggested that for this purpose every sea-going vessel should be
compelled to carry brilliant percussion lights, to be used as "danger signals," which
would ignite on being struck against any hard substance; and that the officer of the

watch, or other person in charge of a ship, should be held criminally responsible that

these signals were ready for instant use in lockers placed on deck in suitable situations.

  He pointed out, that, besides indicating danger, these lights, by the use of four dif-

ferent coloius, might be made to show whether a vessel was at anchor or in motion,

and her  course  upon any one of  the  eight principal points of  the compass                                                          or, if a
                                                                                                                                    ;

more simple code of signals was considered desirable, that two coloured lights, and a

white light, used singly, would be sufficient to make known the tack on which a ship was

steering, or whether she was stationary ; and observed that such lights, which would

not be costly, and would be always at hand in case of danger, might be made suf-

ficiently brilliant, and of such an illuminating power as could not fail to attract the

attention of the helmsman, even supposing the look-out to be asleep or otherwise

neglecting his duty.
    It was not proposed to interfere with the existing lights carried by sea-going ves-

sels, but to use the percussion lights as " danger signals" only.
   Captain Leach also recommended the use of percussion lights by railway companies,

and di-ew attention to several cases of collisions on railways which could not have
occurred had the guards of the disabled trains possessed such a means, in addition to
their ordinary signal lamps, of making the drivers of the following trains aware of their

danger.

    Early Methods of Propelling Ships. By John Macgregor, M.A.

   Almost every method of marine propulsion has its type in means employed by sea-
water animals, and among these may be specially noticed :

   1st. Arms, legs, fins, tails, paddles, membranes or cilia, with a reciprocating
motion feathered in the water, as by water-beetles, amphibious animals and fish,

   2nd. AVater forced through tubes, as by the cuttlefish and paper nautilus.
   3rd. Creeping motion by whelks. "Sooping" motion by the Pedipes. Creeping
and swimming combined by the Lepidosiren.
   4th. Screw propeller motion, by the Paramecia vidffaris (in which an undulation
or protuberance moves round its oval-shaped body spirally*).
   .Oth. [Propidsion by sails t, as by the " Portuguese man-of-war" and aquatic birds.]

   Marine propulsion methods may be classified according to
    Tke power used and machinery employed.

        I. Muscular power, (A.) of men, (B.) of animals.
      IL Expulsion of gas or water against air or water.
    III. Springs,wcights, gunpowder, capillary attraction, wind and other motions.
     IV. Endless chains and revolving wheels.
      v. Submerged propellers.

           (e.) Feathering oars, collapsing vanes and sculling oars,
           (i.) Feathering paddle-wheels and screws.

     VI. Submarine vessels.
   VII. Steering apparatus and directors.

(A.) Propulsion by inuscular power of men.
   The methods arranged progressively.
   (1.) Swimming without artificial aid.
   (2.) Webbed fins or hooks on the limbs, as proposed by Borelli (a.d. 1683), to
              enable the diver "to swim like a frog or creep like a crabj."

    (3.) The body swimming partly supported.
       (a.) On skins (Nineveh marbles) or gourds (Earth's African Travels).
       (6.) On a rope (Memoirs of Missionaries in China),
       (c.) On a piece of ice (II. Valturius, a.d. 1472).
       (d.) On reeds (as now in Egypt or in Tartary), where a bundle of reeds is tied to
           a horse's tail while the rider holds his head, swimming (Churchill's Voyages,

              vol. i. p. 468).

    (4.) The body floating out of the water and propelled,
       (a.) By the hand paddling (as in China*).
       (b.) By the hand working a pole with which to push or punt, or an oar to paddle,
                scull or row with.

    Mandan Indians' tub-shaped boat, rowed by a woman drawing a shovel-like oar

inwards.

   A similar oar used like a mud-rake on the Rhine.

    Single oars with a sculling motion were used in Nineveh, Egypt and China, and
some of them had twenty rowers to each.

   Double-bladed paddles were uncommon in Egypt. They are represented in an old
Japanese Dictionar}' in thirteen volumes, in the British Museum, and in Nicolo's
Voyage in Greenland (a.d. 1380).

   Two oars worked by one man were used in the ancient British coracle, but not often

in Egypt or Nineveh.

   A curious plan, wholly disused now, is shown in Lepsius, Denkmaeler aus Egypten,

&c., by which Egyptian rowers stood facing the outside of the boat and swinging
sideways, while each held two oars nearly vertical, on the same side of the boatf.

   Pin rowlocks and oar-slings were used in Egypt; and the men stood or sat at the

oar with one leg raised on a midriff platform J.
    (Oars have been worked by machinery moved by wind, water, rolling of the vessel,

weights, springs, and steam.) One of the ships Columbus used in his voyage to
America was propelled by thirty-eight oars. (A drawing is in ' Columbus' Letters,'

A.D. 1493.)

   " Edgar was rowed on the Dee by eight tributary kings §."

(B.) Muscular potver of animah.

      (a.) Vessels towed by animals. In Leopold's ' Theatrum' is a sketch of a man in
               a boat holding a plough drawn by horses in shallow water. Barges were
            until lately drawn on the river Cam by horses walking in the centre of the

                  stream,

     I. Three Egyptian paintings represent (not clearly) an ox harnessed to oars.
    II. Propulsion by forcing jets of water was patented twenty times before a.d. 1830,
although Dr. Allen had proposed to apply the steam-engine thus a hundred years

before.

    III. Other useless plans employed gunpowder, clockwork, kites or windmills, and
one (a.d. 1827) had a drum packed with sponges, which were to move by the weight

--184 REPORT 1857.

The Spaniards assert that Blasco de Garay used a paddle-wheel steam-boat in a.d.

1543 +.

The French account of the Marquis de Jouffroy as the inventor of steam-boats

(in A.D. 1783) seems untrue§,
   Denis Papin first suggested a paddle-wheel steam-boat (a.d. 1690), then Savery in

A.D. 1702, and Hulls in a.d. 1736.
   Miller (a.d. 1788), Symington and Taylor made the first practical steam-boat in

Scotland.

V. (Omitting notice of countless modifications of vanes and duck-feet propellers.)

Screw propellers were used in China^f, and proposed to be driven by steam, by

D. Papin (a.d. 1690) and Bernouilli (a.d. 1752).
   VI. Submarine vessels. Alexander the Great used onejl. Van Drebbel made one

for King James I., and tried it in the Thames with twelve rowers.

Borelli (a.d. 1683) proposed a submarine metal bag covering a man's head and

Acontaining air to breathe.   piston moved in a cylinder (carried round his waist),

and lowered or raised him in the water like the natatory organ of a fish. Borelli

described also a submarine boat. Bags open to the water could be pressed or extended

so as to raise or lower the vessel**.

   Williams (a.d. 1692) patented a plan by which men in a tube open to the air above,
worked below water with their hands through water-tight sleeves, and similar means
had been suggested by drawings in Vegetiusff . Diving-bell first noticed in Europe

by Taisnier (a.d. 1500).

VII. Steering apparatus and the compass.
One oar was used in Babylonia, and two, three or more in Egypt, all on the same

side of the stem.

   Several Egyptian paintings represent a steersman sitting between two oars moved
by cords ; but though two models in the British Museum (unique and well preserved)

are furnished with this apparatus, it is difficult to see how it operated JJ.
    Three rudders (one in the middle) were used in Siam §§.

   A ring or enclosed rowlock for hanging the rudder is depict»d once on the Egyptian

tombs (Lepsius, band 3, hi. 28).

The rudder was first hung on pintles in a.d. 1328^^.

A rudder   slung  by  a pole  is  sketched in    an  old Japanese  dictionary and                                        was
                                                                                                                  ||||,

used 500 years ago by the Danes***.

A tiller is shown in one Egyptian painting (Lepsius, band 2, bl. 101).

Columbus used a vessel steered by oars at opposite ends (as whale-boats are at

present).

Rafts on the Rhine are steered by a bough of a tree.
" Starboard" means "styr bord," the side on which hung the " styr" or steer-oar.

R. Valtnrius (a.d. 1472) says Pericles first used the oar to steer at the stern.

The mariner's compass was probabl}' invented in Chinaftt- It is supposed to be

alluded to by Chaucer, and was invented by Gioia of Amalphi, about a.d. 1300. The

Arabs used eighteen points for the compass.

Before the use of the loadstone, sailors sent out birds to find the position and dis-

tance of the land. Three ravens for this purpose are mentioned in the voyage of Floeo,

   J Since the above paper was read, the writer has inspected the letters of Blasco de Garay,
in the Ruyal Arcliives at Simancas in Spain. In these letters there is no mention of the use

of steam in the experiments with vessels, .\fter diligent public and private inquiries and

search in the libraries and museum of Barcelona, it appears that no valid grounds can be

assigned for the assertion that Blasco de Garay invented the steam-boat.

The writer has also inspected a paper at the Patent Office in Paris, duly stamped and signed

by notaries, which affirms that the Marquis de Jouffroy caused a vessel 130 feet long to

move by a steam-engine on the Saone, in July, a.d. 1783.

notice.

   The foregoing paper was further illustrated by an original sketch of a Nile boat
made by a Mahommedan, which strikingly resembled the " Heaven-bound ship" de-
picted by Clemens as a symbol of the " Christian church." Also by an old sketch

On a new Railway Signal. By Dr. Gray.

The author said the new railway-signal had been tested very satisfactorily upon the

Midland Great Western Railway- The qualities which it possessed, and which were

--relied on as establishing its value and efficiency, were, First, the signal could be made

from the guard to the driver and back again with certainty and rapidity. Secondly,

that the guard and driver should be able to communicate with each other by means of

a code of signals. Thirdly, that in certain cases the signal apparatus should be self-

acting automatic; for instance, if any accident caused the severance of the train, which

would prevent any communication between the guard and the driver by the voluntary

action of either, that notice of the fact would be conveyed to them by the apparatus

itself. Fourthly, that there should be no special skill required in order to manage or

make the signal ; what he meant by that was, that it should not be liable to derange-

ment, and that in case some derangement did occur, the ordinary workmen employed

on railway works would be able to set the apparatus right or make a new one. Fifthly,

that there should be always a constant indication before the parties in charge of the

train that the signal was in working order, so that the guard would not start from the

station without knowing that the signal was all right and in reliable condition, and

would not fail him upon the journey. The sixth requisite was, that the communication

between the carriages should be of such a nature that there would be no serious delay

in making up the train of carriages, because of the use of the signal.  *

The author entered at some length into the principles and details of the invention,

and exhibited a working model, the size of the actual apparatus, and several experi-

ments were then tried, all of which worked successfully.

The essential principle of the signal was stated to be the producing, in a metal tube

of about f inch bore, and which was placed along the entire train of carriages, a more
or less perfect exhaust, and causing the distribution of that exhaust to act on the sig-

nals. A common exhaust-pump, worked by an excentric on the axle of the guard's

van, works the pump when the train moves, and instantly exhausts the air from the

tube. This action causes a piston-head that plays in a little cylinder at the end of
the long tube which is placed in front of the driver, to be pressed up into the cylinder
by the external air, and to carry with it and out of view, a red bar or semaphore.
Tiiis bar remains invisible when all is right, but the guard, by turning a cock on his

end of the tube like a gas-cock, destroys the exhaust and lets down the red bar or
danger signal in front of the driver's eye. The semaphore is so adjusted, that it is in
fact also a weighted lever on a little steam cock to which a whistle is fitted, and when
it is let down to indicate danger, it turns on steam by its falling, and so attracts the
driver's attention by the whistle. The tube from carriage to carriage has a flexible
pendent and a telescope air-tight connexion. This allows freedom of motion, and on

the severance of a train the tube is opened, and all the signals given at both ends of

the train. Similar signals, the steam whistle alone excepted, are placed in the guard's
van, and the driver or any passenger can communicate with him by opening a stop-

cock. A little treddle placed near the guard's foot enables him to test the apparatus,
and ascertain if the connexions are all right before the train moves. The excentric

then maintains the exhaust.

   The signals were made through a tube 168 feet in length with the greatest rapidity,
and the air was exhausted at one end by an air-pump, but by a simple turning of the
cock the effect of this exhaustion was destroyed, and a red bar or semaphore was
thrown across a little box representing the box beside the driver, and a whistle was
also made to sound by the same instrumentality.

On the Construction of the 36-inch Mortars made by order of Her Majesty's
                           Government. By R. Mallet.

   The autlior gave a verbal account of the two 36-inch wrought-iron mortars, and of
the 36-inch shells constructed from his designs for the British Government. He
described the peculiarities of their construction, to avoid difficulties of manufacture
and of transport in service; and contrasted the powers of demolition as against forti-

fied places, of these large shells, or transferable mines, with the 13-inch shell, the
largest heretofore in use, concluding witli some remarks on the application of wrought
iron to artiller}-.

On Tange7it-Wheels. By Guildford L. Molesworth.

   The author first presented some general views in hydraulics, and compared the
efficiency of water-wheels, turbines and tangent-wheels. He then described and

showed diagrams of a small wheel somewhat similar to the tangent-wheel, for a small

workshop.

  A description was then given of a tangent-wheel sent by the author to Tasmania

for driving a corn-mill of six pairs of stones, with the dressing machinery. The fall
was 270 feet, with an available quantity of 2i cubic feet of water per second. The
water was confined in a pipe and brought down to act on the periphery of a wheel
3 feet in diameter, which revolved at a velocity of 360 revolutions per minute ; the
rims of the wheel were turned up truly on the shaft, and the edges of the inlet care-
fully faced to correspond with them ; the buckets were of wrought iron, cast into the

rims, curved and ventilated ; the conditions to be observed in forming the curve of

the buckets were described as requiring the water to enter without shock, remaining
in the bucket sufficiently long to expend its vis viva, and then leaving it without dimi-

nishing the effect ; the formation of these curves being the most important feature in

producing an efficient machine.
   The toe of the shaft was so arranged as not to be submerged, and the oiling was

managed by a convenient apparatus.
   The mechanical effect of the tangent-wheel was stated to be from seventy-five to

eighty per cent., which was rather higher than that of Fourneyron's turbine.
   Some experimenters had affirmed that Fourneyron's turbines had given out as much

as eighty-five or ninety per cent., but it was evident that such statements must arise
from some mistake ; the consumption of power froai diiferent causes was stated to be
about twenty-five per cent., leaving only seventy-five per cent, available ; the probable
source of error was supposed to have arisen from the use of incorrect coefficients for
efflux in gauging the amount of water passing through the turbine and probably in
some instances from neglecting the ele ment of velocity in the body of water gauged.

LHCastel's formula of Q=3-5  VH-f- 035 v^ was given as applicable to the case.

It was also stated, that in practice Whitelaw's turbines gave much less mechanical

effect than that usually attributed to them, viz. seventy-five per cent. The causes of

loss of power were enumerated, and it was said that many which had been erected on

the Continent had given great dissatisfaction, and had been for the most part replaced

either by water-wheels, tangent-wheels, or turbines of a different kind. The tangent-

wheel had, on the contrary, replaced well-constructed over-shot wheels, and had been

highly approved of.

 --The advantages of the tangent-wheel were summed up as follows : 1st. The water

deviated less from its course and was less broken up than in turbines. 2ndlj'. The

tangent-wheel was capable of such regulation as to work with varying quantities of

water with undiminished effect, one quarter of the maximum quantity of water pro-
ducing as good a proportional effect as the maximum. 3rdly. It was cheap and
simple, and required no expensive foundations. 4thly. The toe of the shaft was not

submerged in the tail-water. 5thly. The working parts were easily got at, and the
wheel taken out in a few minutes for examination or repair. 6thly. The velocity of
the wheel was not dependent on the quantity of water. 7thly. The motion was

extremely steady and regular.
   The method of placing the wheel with its axis horizontal was stated to have been

tried, but without success, owing to the difficulty of freeing it of water.

In conclusion, it was urged that the tangent-wheel was applicable to many falls in

which  the  adoption  of  the water-wheel was  not  only unsuitable  but  impracticable
                                                                                                                                ;

     On the Want of Facts respecting the Performance of Vessels at Sea.
                              By Admiral Moorsom.

   The author had himself arrived at results both in speed and in power for a great
variety of types which appeared very near the truth ; and if a similar method of inves-
tigation were applied to carry out experiments conducted at sea under a vast variety
of conditions as to form, size, and circutnstances, rules might be established which
would serve to determine much of what was now the subject of controversy, and go
far to remove the reproach on the greatest maritime nation of the world, which was

--contained in the following passage of a work by Mr. Scott Russell : " It is admitted

that out of every three steam-vessels that are built, two fell very far short of fulfilling
the intention with which they were constructed."

   Improvements in the mode of Working Steam- Engines. By T. MoY.

   Bv drawings the author showed how he proposed to work steam-engines. No. 1
was an elevation plan and cross section of a pipe-boiler. The boiler is composed of a
continuous tube, which may be arranged as in the drawing or in any other efficient
mode, and is always kept full of water. By the circulation of the water, the cylinder
is always kept at the same heat as the boiler. The heated water circulates through

the boiler, jacket, and valve-box of the cylinder ; the upper and hottest end of the
tube communicates with the upper part of the jacket, and the lower end of the tube

carries the cooled water back to the boiler. An open communication is maintained
in any convenient place or places between the jacket and valve-box. The slide-valve
(Drawing No. 2) has three cavities in it. The upper and lower cavities are for

receiving and delivering the necessary quantity of water from the valve-box to the
steam-passage. The middle cavity is for the eduction. Before the water-cavity of
the valve arrives with its supply of w^ater at the steam-port, its communication with
the valve-box is cut off, and this portion of water turns into steam and works the
piston. In the drawing No. 2, the upper water-cavity is shown as having arrived
opposite the upper passage and the piston has just commenced the down-stroke,
while the used steam imder the piston is passing off through the eduction. The
throttle-valve and regulator must be on the eduction.

   The author mentions a plan for controlling the number of inches of water supplied
to the cylinder at each stroke without stopping the engine. The engine always

works expansively.
    Suppose an engine, the internal capacity of whose cylinder is equal to 3 cubic feet,

to be supplied by the valve with 3 cubic inches of water at 500° Fahr. As soon as
this is at liberty to enter the cylinder it begins to turn into steam, which will drive
the piston until all the water has turned into steam ; from this point of the stroke to
the end the steam will work expansively, and at the end of the stroke will be just
equal to the pressure of the atmosphere. By its then passing through the eduction
into a surface condenser (without injection, and without attempting to obtain a
vacuum), it can be condensed to water and returned to the boiler.

    Suppose tliis engine to be used in a factory. If it is required to reduce the power

--of the engine in consequence of some of the work being thrown out of gear, this may

be done in two ways by reducing the temperature of the boiler, or by reducing the
quantity of water supplied by the water-cavity of the slide-valve ; in the former case
the engine will work less expansively and with less pressure ; in the latter more
expansively and with the same pressure at the first portion of the stroke.

   By this mode of working steam-engines, great safety with increased pressure and
compactness may be obtained ; incrustation of the boiler and priming of the cylinder

will be prevented,

188 REPORT 1857.

On the Philosophy of the Wave-Line System of Ship-building. By T. Moy.

   The purport of this paper was to explain the mode of forming the wave-line ; the rea-
son why the wave-line is the hest form for vessels ; and to show how speeds equal to fifty
miles an hour and upwards may be attained by using the wave form in its integrity.

   The mode of forming the wave-line was shown in the drawing exhibited.
   Treating water as subject to the same laws as solid bodies in motion, it was urged
that the best motion for one atom of the column of water in travelling its 20 feet from
the cutwater to the extent of the midship section, is that which the piston of a steam-
engine would receive if connected with a crank of the length of 1 feet, the connecting
rod being supposed to be infinite. The wave-curve imparts this motion to each atom,
and therefore to the whole column of water ; and any attempt to make this line either
fuller or sharper will cause a decrease of speed. Also that any angle whatever formed
at the stem with the line of motion is improper and highly detrimental to speed.
   It was proposed that the common term " resistance " is inapi;licable, and that the
term " duty" is preferable.
    'i'lic subject was then illustrated by supposing a vessel of 40 feet beam, 100 feet
length of bow, and 200 horse power to travel at ten miles an hour; this vessel's duly
would be that of giving motion to two columns of water, one on each side of her keel
at right angles to her course, at a speed of 176 feet per minute or 2 miles an hour.
This vessel was called No. 2. No. 3, with a bow 200 feet long, the same midship
section, and 400 horse power, will perform the duty of putting tlie water in
motion at 176 feet per minute or 2 miles an hour, while she perforins 20 miles an
liour. No. 4, with 250 feet bow and the same midship section and 500 horse power,
will put the water in motion at the same speed, 176 feet per minute or 2 miles an
hour, while the vessel performs 25 miles an hour; and No. 5, with a bow 500 feet
long and the same midship section, performs the same duty of putting the water in
motion at the same low speed of 2 miles an hour, while she travels at the speed of

--50 miles an hour, and only requires 1000 horse power, while the ' Great Eastern,'

in consequence of her great beam, would have to give motion to the column of water

Aequal to O^rd miles an hour, in order to attain a speed of 50 miles an hour.

vessel of 8000 tons and 1000 horse power could be built upon the above sharp lines
to travel at the rate of 50 miles an hour.

    'J'he following is the rule to find the speed of the water at right angles to the line

--of motion : Divide the speed in feet per minute by the length of bow and multiply

the product by half the length of beam, which gives the speed of the column of water
in feet per minute. The following Table was referred to :

                On the Principle of the Transformation of Structures.

        By W. J. Macquorn Rankine, LL.D., F.R.S. L. and E.

   This paper consists of an explanation of some of the practical applications of a
principle first communicated by the author to the Roj'al Society in 1856, viz. if a
structure of a given figure be stable under a system of forces represented by given
lines, every structure whose figure is a parallel projection of the given figure is stable
under a system offorces represented by the corresponding parallel projections of the
given lines.

    (Two figures are said to be parallel projections of each other when every pair of
parallel and equal lines in one figure corresponds to a pair of parallel and equal lines
in the other. Thus all circles and ellipses are parallel projections of each other ; so
also are all spheres and ellipsoids.)

    This principle enables the design for a bridge with a sloping extrados and a distorted
semi-elliptical arch to be deduced from the design for a bridge with a horizontal
extrados and a semicircular arch. In like manner, from the figure of an equilibrated
arch for sustaining the pressure of a fluid, which is equal horizontally and vertically,
can be deduced the figure of an equilibrated arch for sustaining the pressure of earth,
which is less horizontally than vertically in a given ratio ; and various analogous
problems can be solved with ease by the principle of the transformation of structures,
whose solution by a direct process would be very tedious and difficult.

Continuation of Experiments to determine the Resistances of Screw-Propellers

  Bywhen revolving ifi Water at different Depths and Velocities.

   George Rennie, F.R.S., ^c.

  My former experiments exhibited some curious phenomena on the effects produced

on the resistances of screw-propellers when revolving in water at high velocities and
at different depths. The first idea of driving screw propellers at high velocities and
immersed at different depths was stated to be due to Mr. Joseph Apsey, an engineer

of Broad Wall, in the parish of Christ Church, Surrey, but from the experiments
having been made in a close boiler, objections were made to them at Glasgow as being

fallacious; and it was only after similar experiments had been made by me in the
open water in the river Thames that they were confirmed. Those results were given
in my last paper, published in the ' Transactions of the British Association ' in 183G.

   Both series of experiments proved that the influence of velocity was much greater

than that of depth, but that the joint action of velocity and depth was very remark-
able. The present paper contains the results of experiments made on differently

formed propellers, for the purpose of ascertaining, first, the effects of screw-propellers
when confined in tubes of a conical form secondly, the effects of form of propellers

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

     On the Quantity of Heat developed by Water when rapidly agitated.

                         By George Rennie, F.R.S,
  My last paper, communicated to the Mechanical Section of the British Association

at Cheltenham, in August 1856, contained a brief notice of the experiments which
had been made upon this subject by Count Rumford, and by Mayer, Joule, Thom-
son, Rankine, &c. The mechanical equivalents which were estimated by those
philosophers therefrom, and the heat developed by chemical as well as by mechanical
action, were briefly noticed ; and the causes which led to the making the experiments

were shown to have originated in the development of heat observed by me in the sea
in stormy weather, and when water ran through sluices at Southampton Dock and
other confined apertures. As formerly stated, the experiments were made by agitating

rapidly a mass of 437 lbs. of well-water confined in a cubical box, until its tempera-
ture became elevated from 59° Fahrenheit's thermometer to 103^° by the same

scale, but without adding the loss of heat by the radiation of the mass ; thus proving
the coiTectness of the theory, namely, that water, like other fluids, was subject to
the same laws as govern chemical or mechanical action ; and thac friction or agitation
was neither more nor less than a disturbance of molecular equilibrium, which, by
deranging from their natural positions the particles of bodies, developes heat and elec-
tricity, according to the constitution of the bodies subject to their action, and to the
rapidity with which those operations were performed. Encouraged therefore by the
facts elicited by the experiments of last year, I undertook this year a new series of
experiments, the objects of which were,

   1st. To prove the accuracy or not of the last year's experiments.
   2nd. The law, or approximation to it, of increased temperature.
   3rd. The possibility of attaining the boiling-point.
   4th. The mechanical equivalent of heat to mechanical power.
   For these purposes an entirely new appai-atus was prepared. It was driven by the

steam-engine as before.

                   Description of the Apparatus for Churning Water.

   The apparatus consisted in the first new series of experiments of a cubical deal box,
28 inches square and 23 inches in depth. It was covered with a lid of the same
material, fitted to prevent the water from escaping while in motion, and was per-
forated with a circular hole in the middle of the lid, to allow the working freely of a
vertical axis or spindle. The spindle itself, which was 2| inches square, was furnished
with eight radial arms, fitted with a series of vertical stirrers nailed upon their sides,
to break the water as much as possible ; and to prevent rotary motion in the water,
vertical boards were fixed in the corners of the box. The axle was supported in two
bearings above the box, and had no bottom spindle as in the former experiments, an
objection which was urged last year. On the contrary, the bottom of the vertical axis
was 3 inches above the bottom of the box. It is clear, therefore, whatever heat might
have been generated by the friction of the bearings of the vertical axle could not be
communicated to the water, and such was found to be the case. The whole appa-
ratus was of wood.

   The box, when filled, contained 50 gallons or 500 pounds of well-water, previous
to the apparatus being set in motion on the 19th of June, 1857 ; the following were

the results of a preliminary trial :

of the ship ; the third point would be the distribution of materials in the construc-
tion of the ship, so as to obtain the safest and strongest possible structure with the
minimum of materials ; and the last point would be to allude generally to the
mechanical arrangements for her propulsion. With respect to size, it was generally
supposed that, as a practical shipbuilder, he was an advocate for big ships. The
contrary, however, was the fact. There were cases in which big ships were good,

and there were certain cases in which big ships were ruinous to their owners. In
every case the smallest ship that would supply the convenience of trade was the right

ship to build. He came there as an advocate of little ships ; and it was the pecu-
liarity of the 'Great Eastern' that she was the smallest ship capable of doing the work

she was intended to do ; and he believed that if she answered the purpose for which
she was designed, she would continue to be the smallest ship possible for her voyage.

It was found by experience that no steam-ship could be worked profitably which
was of less size than a ton to a mile of the voyage she was to perform, carrying
her own coal. Thus, a ship intended to ply between England and America would
not pay permanently unless she were of 2500 or 3000 tons burden. In like man-

ner, if a vessel were intended to go from this country to Australia or India, without

coaling on going out, but taking her coals with her, she would require to be 13,000
tons burden. And turning to the case before them, it would be found that the big
ship was a little short of tJie proper size. Her voyage to Australia and back would

be 25,000 miles ; her tonnage, therefore, should be 25,000 tons, whereas its actual

amount was 22,000 tons. The idea of making a ship large enough to carry her own

--coals for a voyage to Australia and back again was the idea of a man famous for

large ideas Mr. Brunei. He suggested the matter to him (Mr. Russell) as a prac-

tical shipbuilder, and the result was the monster vessel which he was about to

describe.

   He had peculiar pleasure in laying a description of the lines of the ship before

the present meeting, because the ship, as a naval structure, as far as her lines

were concerned, was a child of the British Association. It was twenty-two years
since they had the pleasure of meeting together in Dublin. On that occasion he

laid before the Mechanical Section a form of construction which had since become
well known as the "wave-line." The Section received the idea so well that it ap-

pointed a committee to examine into the matter, with the intention, if they found the
wave principle to be the true principle, to proclaim it to the world. The committee
pursued its investigations, publishing the results in the accountof their 'Transactions ;'
and from that time to the present he had continued to make large and small vessels

on the wave principle; and the diffusion of the knowledge of this system through

 the ' Transactions of the British Association ' had led to its almost universal adop-
" tion. Wherever they found a steam- vessel with a high reputation for speed, economy

of fuel, and good qualities at sea, he would undertake to say that they would find
that she was constructed on the wave principle.

   He would endeavour to explain what were the principles of the wave-line as di-
stinguished from the older-fashioned modes of building, and how they were carried

out in the big ship. All practical men knew that the first thing a shipbuilder had to

think of was what was called the midship section of the vessel : that was, the sec-
tion which would be made if the vessel were cut through the middle, and the spec-

tator saw the cut portions. Mr. Russell here pointed out a diagram of the midship

section of the ' Wave,' a small vessel about /i tons burden, which was the first ever

Nowconstructed upon that principle.   the first thing to be done in building a steam-

vessel was to make a calculation of the size of the midship section in the water. In

sailing from one place to another, it was necessary to excavate a canal out of the
·water large enough to allow the whole body of the ship to pass through. The pro-
blem was, how to do that most economically ; and this was effected by making the
canal as narrow and as shallow as possible, so that there would be the smallest

quantity of water possible to excavate. Therefore it was that the shipbuilder

endeavoured to obtain as small a midship section as he could ; and that had been

--eflected in the case of the big ship, whose midship section was small, not small

absolutely, but small in proportion.

In increasing the tonnage of a ship, three things had to be considered, the paying

jKiwer, the propelling power, and the dimensions. Mr. Russell then entered into a
                               ;

TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  197

calculation to show that while he doubled the money-earning power of a ship by
increasing its size, he only increased its midship section by 50 per cent. For instance,

a ship of 2500 tons burden would have 500 feet of excavation through the water to
do ; the big ship had 2000 feet of excavation ; and the lineal dimensions of one
were to the lineal dimensions of the other as 1 to 2'1. The excavation to be done
by the big ship in relation to that to be done by the small ship was as 4 to 1, but
the carrying power was as 10 to 1. To propel the big ship they had a nominal

H.P. of 2500, while to propel the smaller vessel there was a nominal H.P. of 500
so that the big ship would be worked quite as economically as the small one.

  Referring again to the wave-line, he would suppose that it was given as a problem to
any one to design a ship on the wave principle. The first thing to be done was to settle
the speed at which the ship was intended to go. If the speed were fixed at 10 miles
an hour, a reference to the table of the wave principle would show that, in order to
effect that object, the length of the ship's bows ought to be about 60 feet, and that

of her stern about 40 feet. If a larger vessel were required, say a ship of 130 feet
long, there would be nothing more to do than to put a middle body of 30 feet in
length between the bow and the stern. Having then made the width of the ship in

accordance with the midship section agreed upon, it would be necessary to draw
what was known as the wave-line on both sides of the bow, and the wave-line of the

second order on both sides of the stern. Constructed in this manner, and propelled
by the ordinary amount of H.P., the ship would sail precisely 10 miles an hour.
They could go slower than 10 miles an hour if necessary, and in doing so they would

economise fuel, in consequence of the diminished resistance of the water ; whereas
there would be a vastly increased resistance if an attempt were made to drive the
steamer more than 10 miles an hour.

   For the speed at which it was intended to drive the ' Great Eastern,' it was found
that the length of her bow should be 330 feet, the length of her stern 220 feet, of
the middle body 120 feet, and of the screw propeller 10 feet; making in all 680 feet
in length. The lines on which she was constructed were neither more nor less than
an extended copy of the lines of all the ships which he had built since he first laid
the wave principle before the Association . It was his pride that he had not put a
single experiment or novelty into the structure of the vessel, with one or two ex-
ceptions, which he had adopted on the recommendation of men who had had prac-
tical experience of their efficacy. The wave principle had never in a single instance
deceived him as to the exact shape a vessel ought to have in order to accomplish a
certain rate of speed, and he had therefore adopted it in the construction of the big

ship.

   He would next refer to the mechanical construction of the big ship, the arrange-

ment of the iron of which she was made, and the object of those arrangements. It
was much to be desired that our mechanical science should make progress by the
simple adoption of what was best, come from where it might ; but he was sorry to
say that iron shipbuilding did not grow in that manner. They commenced by ser-
vilely imitating the construction of wooden ships, thereby incurring a great deal of
unnecessary labour and expense. There was this great difference between the
strength of iron and of wood, that whilst the latter was weak crossways and strong
lengthways, or with the grain of the timber, iron was almost equally strong either
way. This had been clearly ascertained by experiments made by Mr. Fairbairn and
Mr. E. Hodgkinson, at the request of the British Association, in whose ' Transac-
tions' the results were published to the world. The consequence was, that the ribs
or frames used to strengthen wooden ships were rendered unnecessary in iron ship-
building; and acting on this principle, the 'Wave' (in the construction of which he
was assisted by two Irishmen) was built of iron entirely, with bulkheads, and had
not a frame in her from one end to the other. He was ashamed to say he did
not always practise what he preached. He was compelled against his will, by the

persons for whom he built, to pursue the old system ; besides which, there were

laws of trade. Acts of Parliament, and Lloyd's rule, to which he was obliged to
conform. Thus, if he did not put a certain number of frames in the ship, a black
mark would be put upon her, and she would not be allowed to go to sea. But
whenever he was allowed to build according to his judgment, he built in what he
considered to be the best way. And he believed that in what he was now placing

before the Section he was laying the grounds of meeting the British Association that
day twenty years, and finding that the mode of mechanical construction which he
proposed had been as universally adopted as the wave principle, because of the pub-

lications of the British Association.

   The author then proceeded to give an elaborate description of the old method of
constructing an iron ship, contrasting it with the improved style which he pursued
at present. Instead of the mass of wooden rubbish, which did not strengthen the
ship, and involved enormous expense, he placed inside the iron shell as many com-
plete bulkheads as the owner permitted him to do, and then constructed in the in-
termediate spaces partial bulkheads, or bulkheads in the centre of which holes had
been cut for the purposes of stowage. The deck was strengthened by introducing
 pieces of angle iron, and other contrivances; and as an iron ship when weak was
 not weak crossways, but lengthways, he strengthened it in this direction by means
 of two longitudinal bulkheads ; and the result was a strength and solidity which
 could not be obtained in any other way. The 'Great Eastern' had all these improve-
 ments, and, in addition, the cellular system, so successfully applied in the Britannia
 Bridge, had been introduced all round the bottom and under the deck of the ship,
 giving the greatest amount of strength to resist crushing that could be procured.
 As he had already obser\'ed, there was nothing new in the ship but her great size
 and cellular construction. It was true she would be propelled both by screw and
 paddles, but there was no reason to doubt that they would work harmoniously.
 He wished he could tell them how fast she would go, but that waa the secret
 of the owners of the ship.

                On the Formation of the Entrances to Tidal Basins.
                        By BiNDON B. Stoney, M.R.I.A.

     In the formation of the entrances to tidal basins, two points have to be considered :
     1 The shape of the entrance.

      2. Its position.

     In existing docks we find some entrances constructed at right angles to the river,
 others sloping upwards against the stream, and others again sloping downwards,
 which latter form not only tends to prevent deposits, but greatly facilitates the entrance
 and departure of vessels. Even though no downward current does exist in the river,
  that form of entrance which slopes in the direction of the vessel's course presents
  obvious advantages, especially in the case of a narrow river, where it is essential that
 a ship should, both before entering and after leaving the basin, be in the line of the
 river, and at the same time not far from its centre, where the channel is deep and un-

  obstructed.

     The usual position of the entrance is at or near the centre of that side of the basin
 which is parallel to the river. This however is objectionable, since, besides promoting
  deposit, it makes it necessary that vessels lying within the basin be warped, at no
  small expense of time and labour, into a suitable position for passing through.

     The chief considerations to be kept in view in the construction of floating docks or

  tidal basins are as follows :
      1 . Facihty of ingress and egress.

     2. Freedom from silting up.
     To these may be added,
     3. Economy of quay room.
      4. Facilities for the land traffic in connexion with the dock.
      These conditions are, it is beheved, in a great measure fulfilled by the form of en-
  trance advocated by the author. The general form of the basin is a lozenge, a trape-
  zium, or a rectangle, whose width is equal to the breadth of two vessels together, with
  sufficient space between them for another vessel to turn round freely : the entrance,
  placed at the lower end, is well sloped in the direction of the ebb current, and has its
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                            199

obtuse angles rounded off, so that a ship or steamer can pass from the river into the
basin, and take up her berth without warping, or any such annoyance and delay.

    Similarly, on leaving, a vessel, when once her head is round, can pass out without
slacking speed, and therefore without risk of being canried by the current against the
pier-heads. The diagram represents a succession of basins formed according to the
proposed method, and, if desirable, at different periods to meet the exigencies of the
port, yetin such a manner that there is easy communication between each quay and
the main road leading into the city or the traffic depots. These quays are, from
the obtuse angles at which they intersect, well adapted for tramways, which may
branch off a trunk line laid along the main road.

   When additional port accommodation is thus obtained the result cannot but be

beneficial to the river, since these basins will act as reservoirs, increasing the volume
of water which passes through the channel, and thus aiding by its source in maintain-

ing the river at its proper depth.

            On the proposed Ship Canal through the Isthmus of Suez.
                                 By Dr. Hodgkin.

     Although the difficulty at one time supposed to exist in the difference of level
between the Mediterranean and Red Seas is now no longer urged, there are other
physical difficulties which are of at least equal importance. The canal must not only
be made, but must also be maintained in a serviceable condition. Now, it is well
known that on the Mediterranean side the sea is not only shallow and sandy, but that
its depth is subject to constant variation from the moving character of the sand-banks.
It might almost be presumed, a priori, that the same causes which prevent any of the
mouths of the Nile from serving as an available ingress or egress for vessels navigating
the Nile, would produce and maintain an effectual obstacle to vessels passing in either
direction between the Mediterranean Sea and an artificial canal. I had an oppor-
tunity of witnessing a strong confirmation of this inference in proceeding from Alex-
andria to Jaffa. Although we kept out at sea to the distance of some miles, the
captain of the steam-boat, which was a much smaller vessel than would be required
for Indian or Australian commerce, thought it needful, in broad daylight, to be
frequently using the sounding-line as a security against stranding his vessel. The
force of this objection is so far admitted by the advocates of the canal as to induce
them to allow that it will be necessary to construct piers advancing some miles into
the sea, and that at their mouth, and in the channel between them, it will be requisite
to keep dredging vessels constantly employed to preserve a practicable passage.

   It will, perhaps, be asked in what the difficulties consist? The general facts maybe

--safely stated to be first, a certain amount of elevated land to be cut through ; secondly,

Itind considerably lower than either sea, where very substantial embankments must be
thrown up to prevent the neighbouring country from being submerged. Throughout
this tract, and probably along the greater portion of the line, a very careful and ex-
pensive process of puddling will be absolutely necessary to enable the canal to hold

water.
