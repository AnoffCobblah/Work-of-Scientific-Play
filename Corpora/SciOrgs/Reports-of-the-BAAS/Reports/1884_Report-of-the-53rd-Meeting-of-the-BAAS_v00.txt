                  EEPORT OF THE COUNCIL.

Be^port Of the Council for tlie year 1882-83, presented to the' General
           Committee at Southport, on Wednesday, September 19, 1883.

     The Council have received reports during the past year from the
General Treasurer, and his account for the year will be laid before the
General Committee this day.

     Since the meeting at Southampton the following have been elected
Corresponding Members of the Association :

Baumhauer, Dr. B. H.                                                                                                                                                                                               Langley, Professor

Clausius, Dr. R.                                                                                                                                                                                                   Rath, Professor G. vom

Du Bois-Raymond, Professor

The Council have nominated Principal J. "W. Dawson, C.M.G., LL.D.,

P.R.S., to be a Vice-President for the meeting at Southport.

As the lamented death of Professor F. M. Balfour, one of the General

Secretaries, occurred only a few weeks before the meeting at South-

ampton, the Council were not prepared at that date to recommend his

successor, but at their next meeting they nominated Mr. A. G. Vernon

Harcourt, F.R.S., as a General Secretary, and requested him to act in

that capacity until the next meeting of the Association. They accord-

ingly now recommend that he be appointed a General Secretary in the

room of the late Professor F. M. Balfour.

They regret the loss by death of three of their number. Of these the

first was Professor H. J. S. Smith, who at Southampton was elected one

of the Vice-Presidents for this meeting                                                                                                                                                                            a man of  whom it is  difficult to
                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

say whether he was more regarded with admiration for his rare talents,

or beloved for his personal qualities. The Association was deprived,

almost simultaneously, of two of its Trustees ; both former General

OfBcers ; both past Presidents. The very advanced age of General

Sabine had for several years prevented him from taking any active part in

the business of the Association (though in his time he had been one of

its most energetic and laborious members), but in Mr. William Spottis-

woode, President of the Royal Society, the Council and the whole Associa-

tion have lost one who was ever active in promoting its interests, to

whom, it was hoped, no small period yet remained for good and useful
work. Few men have been so deeply and deservedly lamented, for in

him were united, to an exceptional degree, great mental powers, singular

ability in practical matters, and a noble unselfishness. The Council

recommend that in the place of the late General Sabine and the late Mr.

Spottiswoode, Lord Ray leigh and Sir Lyon Playfair be elected Trustees of

the Association.

Four resolutions were referred by the General Committee to the

Council for consideration, and action, if desirable. In respect of one of

these, that which empowered the Council to communicate with Foreign

Scientific Associations with the view of promoting the organisation of an
                                         EEPOET OF THE COUNCIL.                         lis

International Scientific Congress, the Council, having regard to the special

circumstances of the present and coming year, have deemed it wiser to

postpone any decisive action for the present.

In accordance with the powers granted to them by the General

Committee in the other resolutions : The Council have considered the

question of amalgamating the Departments of Zoology and Botany and

of Anatomy and Physiology for the present year, and have decided to

amalgamate them under the designation of the Section of Biology, retain-

ing the Department of Anthropology.

The Council have also appointed a Committee, with Mr. F. Galton as

Chairman, and Mr. H. G. Fordham as Secretary, 'to draw up suggestions

upon methods of more systematic observation and plans of operation for

local Societies, together with a more uniform mode of publication of the

results of their work.' This Committee were also requested to draw up a

list of local Societies which published their transactions. They have pre-

sented a preliminary report to the Council, with a request that it may be

communicated to the Committees of Sections for consideration and sug-

gestions. This the Council propose to do, and recommend that after it

assumes its final form it be printed in the annual volume, among the

Areports made to the Association.                                  list of publishing local Societies will

be appended to the report.

The Council have further appointed a Committee to co-operate with

them for the purpose of considering the arrangements for the meeting at

Montreal.

     In respect of this meeting, the Council have to inform the Association

that of those who were members at the time of the meetinsr at South-

ampton, 445 have notified their intention of being present at the meeting

at Montreal, and 55 persons have either become members or expressed

their wish to become members, wiib the view of taking part in this

meeting. Negotiations with respect to the arrangements for the meeting

on the basis of the letter from Sir A. T. Gait, dated March 3, 1883, are
still proceeding, and for some little time it will not be possible for the

Council to communicate the precise details to the members of the Associa-

tion, but the following points may be regarded as settled : There will be

a reduction of fares on the part of the Steamship Companies to all

members of the Association, and a further reduction, in consequence of

the Canadian subsidy, at any rate to all who were members at the meet-

--ing of 1882 ; and there will be an excursion after the meeting free of
--cost to members as regards transit one to the Rocky Mountains, lasting

from twelve to fourteen days, another to the Falls of Niagara and

Chicago                                  with probably one or two  shorter excursions.  As soon as all
                                      ;

details can be arranged the Council will communicate them to the
members of the Association.

    The Council have considered what alterations, if any, it may b&
desirable to make in the transaction of business at the Montreal Meeting,

in consequence of the exceptional distance, and the unprecedented fact

that the place of meeting is not within the British Isles. They are of

opinion that, as there is likely to be so representative a gathering of

British members at Montreal, and as 154 members of the General Com-

mittee have signified their intention of being present, little alteration will
be necessary in the custom, and no changes need be proposed in the

written law of the Association. There will, however, be difficulties in

fixing the place of meeting for 1886, and the date of that in 1885, for
Ix REPORT 1883.

delegates from the towns concerned could not be expected to attend. It

may also be felt that members who are unable to leave the United

Kingdom ought to have the opportunity of voting on these points, and on
the election of the President and Officers for 1885. The Council, there-

fore, recommend that the General Committee hold only two meetings at
Monti-eal, and an adjourned meeting at some convenient place in London,
on some day, to be hereafter fixed, towards the end of the month of

October, 1884.
      It has been represented to the Council that a strong wish is felt in

some of the Sections to meet at an earlier hour than eleven o'clock on the
Saturday morning ; the Council, therefore, recommend that an explana-
tory note be added to the rule which fixes the hour of the Sectional
Meetings, to state that on this day only the Committee of any Section
can arrange for that Section to commence its meeting at any time not

earlier than ten or later than eleven o'clock.

     The Council have been informed that, through an inadvertence, the
resolution of the Sectional Committee recommending the reappointment
of the Committee on Underground Temperature was not transmitted to

the Committee of Recommendations, and so did not receive the sanction
of the General Committee. The Council, having regard to the important
work carried on by that Committee, have requested them, through their
Secretary, Professor Everett, to continue their labours and make a report,
as though they had been duly appointed. The Council ask that this
action of theirs be sanctioned, and that the above-named report be re-

ceived and printed in the annual volume among the Reports of Com-

mittees duly appointed.

     One vacancy having been caused in the Council by the death of
Professor H. J. S. Smith, one by the i^etirement of Sir H. E. L. Thuillier,
one by the election of Professor Cayley to the Presidency, and one by
that of Mr. Vernon Harcourt to the office of General Secretary, there
remains only one name which it is necessary to remove from the list.

     The Council propose that, in accordance with the regulations, the
retiring member shall be the following :

                                           Mr. J. Heywood.
     The Council recommend the re-election of the other ordinary members
of the Council, with the addition of the gentlemen whose names are dis-

tinguished by an asterisk in the following list :

                                                    BY

               AETHUE CAYLEY,

M.A., D.C.L., LL.D., F.R.S., Sadlerian Professor of Pure Mathematics in the
                                             JJiiiversity of Cambridge,

                                PRESIDENT.

Since our last meeting we have been deprived of three of our most

distinguished members. The loss by the death of Professor Henry John

Stephen Smith is a very grievous one to those who knew and admired

and loved him, to his University, and to mathematical science, which he

cultivated with such ardour and success. I need hardly recall that the

branch of mathematics to which he had specially devoted himself was

that most interesting and difficult one, the Theory of Numbers. The

immense range of this subject, connected with and ramifying into so

many others, is nowhere so well seen as in the series of reports on

the progress thereof, brought up unfortunately only to the year 1865,
contributed by him to the Reports of the Association : but it will still
better appear when to these are united (as will be done in the collected

works in course of publication by the Clarendon Press) his other mathe-

matical writings, many of them containing his own further developments

of theories referred to in the reports. Thei-e have been recently or are

being published many such collected editions--Abel, Cauchy, Cliffijrd,

Gauss, Green, Jacobi, Lagrange, Maxwell, Riemann, Steiner. Among

these the works of Henry Smith will occupy a worthy position.

More recently, General Sir Edward Sabine, K.C.B., for twenty-one

years general secretary of the Association, and a trustee, President of the

meeting at Belfast in the year 1852, and for many years treasurer and

afterwards President of the Royal Society, has been taken from us, at an

age exceeding the ordinary age of man. Born October 1788, he entered

the Royal Artillery in 1803, and commanded batteries at the siege of
mFort Erie
            1814                          made  magnetic  and  other observations in  Ross and
                                       ;

Parry's North Polar exploration in 1818-19, and in a series of other

voyages. He contributed to the Association reports on Magnetic Forces

in 1836-7-8, and about forty papers to the Philosophical Transactions
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

originated the system of Magnetic Observatories, and otherwise signally

promoted the science of Terrestrial Magnetism.

There is yet a very great loss--another late President and trustee of

the Association, one who has done for it so much, and has so often
attended the meetings, whose presence among us at this meeting we

--might have hoped for the President of the Royal Society, William

Spottiswoode. It is unnecessary to say anything of his various merits :

the place of his burial, the crowd of sorrowing friends who were present

in the Abbey, bear witness to the esteem in which he was held.
     I take the opportunity of mentioning the completion of a work pro-

moted by the Association : the determination by Mr. James Glaisher of

the least factors of the missing three out of the first nine million numbers :

the volume containing the sixth million is now published.

I wish to speak to you to-night upon Mathematics. I am quite aware

myof the difiBcnlty arising from the abstract nature of    subject and if,
                                                                                                  ;

as I fear, many or some of you, recalling the Presidential Addresses at

--former meetings for instance, the resume and survey which we had at

York of the progress, during the half-century of the lifetime of the Asso-

--ciation, of a whole circle of sciences Biology, Palaeontology, Geology,
--Astronomy, Chemistry so much more familiar to you, and in which

there was so much to tell of the fairy-tales of science ; or at South-

ampton, the discourse of my friend who has in such kind terms intro-

duced me to you, on the wondrous practical applications of science to

electric lighting, telegraphy, the St. Gothard Tunnel and the Suez

Canal, gun-cotton, and a host of other purposes, and with the grand

concluding speculation on the conservation of solar energy : if, I say,

recalling these or any earlier Addresses, you should wish that you were

now about to have, from a diiferent President, a discourse on a different

subject, I can very well sympathise with you in the feeling.

But, be this as it may, I think it is more respectful to you that I

should speak to you upon and do my best to interest you in the subject
which has occupied me, and in which I am myself most interested. And

in another point of view, I think it is right that the Address of a Presi-

dent should be on his own subject, and that different subjects should be
thus brought in turn before the meetings. So much the worse, it may

be, for a particular meeting ; but the meeting is the individual, which

on evolution principles must be sacrificed for the development of the

race.

    Mathematics connect themselves on the one side with common life

and the physical sciences ; on the other side with philosophy, in regard"^
to our notions of space and time, and in the questions which have arisen
as to the universality and necessity of the truths of mathematics, and the
foundation of our knowledge of them. I would remark here that the

connection (if it exists) of arithmetic and algebra with the notion of time

is far less obvious than that of geometry with the notion of space.

     As to the former side, I am not making before you a defence of

mathematics, but if I were I should desire to do it--in such manner as in

--the 'Republic ' Socrates was required to defend justice quite irrespectively

of the worldly advantages which may accompany a life of virtue and
                                                                    ADDRESS.                                                                                       5

justice, and to show that, independently of all these, justice was a thing

desirable in itself and for its own sake not by speaking to you of the

utility of mathematics in any of the questions of common life or of

physical science. Still less would I speak of this utility before, I

trust, a friendly audience, interested or willing to appreciate an interest

in mathematics in itself and for its own sake. I would, on the contrary,

rather consider the obligations of mathematics to these different subjects

as the sources of mathematical theories now as remote from them, and in

--as diflPerent a region of thought for instance, geometry from the measure-
--ment of land, or the Theory of I^umbers from arithmetic as a river at

its mouth is from its mountain source.

On the other side, the general opinion has been and is that it is indeed

by experience that we arrive at the truths of mathematics, but tliat expe-

rience is not their proper foundation : the mind itself contributes some-

thing.  This is involved in the Platonic                                      theory of   reminiscence                                                             looking
                                                                                                                                                                ;

at two things, trees or stones or anything else, which seem to us more or

less equal, we arrive at the idea of equality : but we must have had this

idea of equality before the time when first seeing the two things we were

led to regard them as coming up more or less perfectly to this idea of

equality                                       and the like     as  regards   our idea of the beautiful, and in                                                    other
                                            ;

cases.

The same view is expressed in the answer of Leibnitz, the nisiintellectus

ipse, to the scholastic dictum, nihil in intelledu cjiiod non prius in sensu :

there is nothing in the intellect which was not first in sensation, except

(said Leibnitz) the intellect itself. And so again in the ' Critick of Pure

Reason,' Kant's view is that while there is no doubt but that all our

cognition begins with experience, we are nevertheless in possession of

cognitions a priori, independent, not of this or that experience, but

absolutely so of all experience, and in particular that the axioms of

mathematics furnish an example of such cognitions a priori. Kant holds

further that space is no empirical conception which has been derived from

external experiences, but that in order that sensations may be referred to

something external, the representation of space must already lie at the

foundation                                           and  that  the external  experience  is itself first  only possible
                                                  ;

by this representation of space. And in like manner time is no empirical

conception which can be deduced from an experience, but it is a necessary

representation lying at the foundation of all intuitions.

    And so in regard to mathematics, Sir W. E. Hamilton, in an Introduc-

tory Lecture on Astronomy (1836), observes : ' These purely mathematical

sciences of algebra and geometry are sciences of the pure reason, deriving
no weight and no assistance from experiment, and isolated or at least

isolable from all outward and accidental phenomena. The idea of order

with its subordinate ideas of number and figure, we must not indeed call

innate ideas, if that phrase be defined to imply that all men must possess

them with equal clearness and fulness : they are, however, ideas which
seem to be so far born with us that the possession of them in any con-
--6 EEPORT 1883.

ceivable degree is only the development of our original powers, tlie un-

folding of our proper humanity.'

The general question of the ideas of space and time, the axioms

and definitions of geometry, the axioms relating to number, and the nature

of mathematical reasoning, are fully and ably discussed in Whewell's

'Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences' (1840), which may be regarded as

containing an exposition of the whole theory.

But it is maintained by John Stuart ]\Iill that the truths of mathematics,

in particular those of geometry, rest on experience ; and as regards geo-

metry, the same view is on very different grounds maintained by the

mathematician Riemann.

    It is not so easy as at first sight it appears to make out how far the

views taken by Mill in his ' System of Logic Ratiocinative and Inductive

(9th ed. 1879) are absolutely contradictory to those which have been spoken

--of ; they profess to be so ; there are most definite assertions (supported

by argument), for instance, p. 263 : ' It remains to enquire what is the
ground of our belief in axioms, what is the evidence on which they rest.

I answer, they are experimental truths, generalisations from experience.

The proposition " Two straight lines cannot enclose a space," or, in other

words, two straight lines which have once met cannot meet again, is an

induction from the evidence of our senses.' But I cannot help considering

Whycontradiction. After enquiring '  are mathematics by almost all

philosophers . . . considered to be independent of the evidence of ex-
perience and observation, and characterised as systems of necessary truth ? '

--Mill proceeds (I quote the whole passage) as follows : ' The answer I

conceive to be that this character of necessity ascribed to the truths of

mathematics, and even (with some reservations to be hereafter made) the

peculiar certainty ascribed to them, is a delusion, in orderto sustain which

it is necessary to suppose that those truths relate to and express the

properties of purely imaginary objects. It is acknowledged that the

conclusions of geometry are derived partly at least from the so-called

definitions, and that these definitions are assumed to be correct represen-

tations, as far as they go, of the objects with which geometry is conversant.

Now, we have pointed out that from a definition as such no proposition

unless it be one concerninsr the meaninsr of a word can ever follow, and

that what apparently follows from a definition, follows in reality from an

implied assumption that there exists a real thing conformable thereto.

This assumption in the case of the definitions of geometry is not strictly

true : there exist no real things exactly conformable to the definitions.

There exist no real points without magnitude, no lines without breadth,

nor perfectly straight, no circles with all their radii exactly equal, nor

squares with all their angles perfectly right. It will be said that the

assumption does not extend to the actual but only to the possible exis-

tence of such things. I answer that according to every test we have

of possibility they are not even possible. Their existence, so far as

we can form any judgment, would seem to be inconsistent with the

physical constitution of our planet at least, ii not of the universal \_sic'].

To get rid of this difficulty and at the same time to save the credit of the

supposed system of necessary truth, it is customary to say that the points

lines, circles and squares which are the subjects of geometry exist in our

conceptions merely and are parts of our minds ; which minds by working
on their own materials construct an a priori science, the evidence of which

is purely mental and has nothing to do with outward experience. By

howsoever high authority this doctrine has been sanctioned, it appears to

me psychologically incorrect. The points, lines and squares which any-

one has in his mind are (as I apprehend) simply copies of the points, lines
and squares which he has known in his experience. Our idea of a point

I apprehend to be simply our idea of the minimum visihile, the small

Weportion of surface which we can see.                                          can reason about a line as if it

had no breadth, because we have a power which we can exercise over the

operations of our minds : the power, when a perception is present to our

senses or a conception to our intellects, of attendincj to a part only of that

perception or conception instead of the whole. But we cannot conceive a

line without breadth : we can form no mental picture of such a line ; all
the lines which we have in our mind are lines possessing breadth. If any-

one doubt this, we may refer him to his own experience. I much question

if anyone who fancies that he can conceive of a mathematical line thinks

so from the evidence of his own consciousness. I suspect it is rather

because be supposes that unless such a perception be possible, mathe-

matics could not exist as a science : a supposition which there will be no

difficulty in showing to be groundless.'

I think it may be at once conceded that the truths of geometry are

truths precisely because they relate to and express the properties of what

Mill calls ' purely imaginary objects ; ' that these objects do not exist in

Mill's sense, that they do not exist in nature, may also be granted ; that

they are ' not even possible,' if this means not possible in an existing

nature, may also be granted. That we cannot ' conceive ' them depends

on the meaning which we attach to the word conceive. I would myself

say that the purely imaginary objects are the only realities, the ovtuq

ovTu, in regard to which the corresponding physical objects are as the

shadows in the cave ; and it is only by means of them that we are able

to deny the existence of a corresponding physical object ; if there is no

conception of straightness, then it is meaningless to deny the existence of

a perfectly straight line.

But at any rate the objects of geometrical truth are the so-called

imaginary objects of Mill, and the truths of geometry are only true, and

a fortiori are only necessarily true, in regard to these so-called imaginary

objects                                   and  these  objects, points,  lines,  circles, &c., in  the mathematical

to geometry, and will then speak of Riemann, but I will first refer to

another passage of the Logic.

     Speaking of the truths of arithmetic Mill says (p. 297) that even here
there is one hypothetical element : ' In all propositions concerning

numbers a condition is implied without which none of them would be

true, and that condition is an assumption which may be false. The con-
dition is that 1=1 : that all the numbers are numbers of the same or of

equal units.' Here at least the assumption may be absolutely true; one

^shilling one shilling in purchasing power, although they may not be

absolutely of the same weight and fineness : but it is hardly necessary

+ =one coin one coin two coins, even if the one be a shilling and the

other a half-crown. In fact, whatever difficulty be raisable as to

geometry, it seems to me that no similar difficulty applies to arithmetic

mathematician or not, we have each of us, in its most abstract form, the

idea of a number ; we can each of us appreciate the truth of a pro-

position in regard to numbers ; and we cannot but see that a truth in

regard to numbers is something difi'erent in kind from an experimental

truth generalised from experience. Compare, for instance, the proposition

that the sun, having already risen so many times, will rise to-morrow, and

the next day, and the day after that, and so on ; and the proposition
that even and odd numbers succeed each other alternately ad infiidtum :

the latter at least seems to have the characters of universality and

necessity. Or again, suppose a proposition observed to hold good for a

long series of numbers, one thousand numbei's, two thousand numbers, as

the case may be : this is not only no proof, but it is absolutely no evidence,

that the proposition is a true proposition, holding good for all numbers

whatever                                             there  are  in  the  Theory  of Numbers very remarkable instances
                                                  ;

of propositions observed to hold good for very long series of numbers,

which are nevertheless untrue.

I pass in review certain mathematical theories.

In arithmetic and algebra, or say in analysis, the numbers or magni-

tudes which we represent by symbols are in the first instance ordinary

We(that is, positive) numbers or magnitudes.                                      have also in analysis and

in analytical geometry negative magnitudes ; there has been in regard to
these plenty of philosophical discussion, and I might refer to Kant's

paper, ' Ueber die negativen Grossen in die Weltweisheit ' (17G3), but the

notion of a negative magnitude has become quite a familiar one, and has

extended itself into common phraseology. I may remark that it is used

iu a very refined manner in bookkeeping by double entry.

But it is far otherwise with the notion which is really the funda-

mental one (and I cannot too strongly emphasise the assertion) under-

lying and pervading the whole of modern analysis and geometry, that of

imaginary magnitude in analysis and of imaginary space (or space as a

locus in quo of imaginary points and figures) in geometry : I use iu each

case the word imaginary as including real. This has not been, so lar as

I am aware, a subject of philosopMcal discassion or enquiry. As regards

the older metaphysical writers this would be quite accounted for by saying

that they knew nothing, and were not bound to know anything, about it

but at present, and, considering the prominent position which the notion

--occupies say even that the conclusion were that the notion belongs' to

mere technical mathematics, or has reference to nonentities in regard to

which no science is possible, still it seems to me that (as a subject of

philosophical discussion) the notion ought not to be thus ignored ; it
should at least be shown that there is a right to ignore it.

    Although in logical order I should perhaps now speak of the notion

just referred to, it will be convenient to speak first of some other quasi-

geometrical  notions                                    those of more-than-three-dimensional space,  and of
                                                     ;

non-Euclidian two- and three-dimensional space, and also of the general-

ised notion of distance. It is in connection with these that Riemann

considered that our notion of space is founded on experience, or rather

that it is only by experience that we know that our space is Euclidian

space.

    It is well known that Euclid's twelfth axiom, even in Playfair's form of

it, has been considered as needing demonstration ; and that Lobatschewsky
constructed a perfectly consistent theory, wherein this axiom was assumed

not to hold good, or say a system of non-Euclidian plane geometry.

MyThere is a like system of non-Euclidian solid geometry.         own view is

that Euclid's twelfth axiom in Playfair's form of it does not need

demonstration, but is part of our notion of space, of the physical space of

--our experience the space, that is, which we become acquainted with by

experience, but which is the representation lying at the foundation of all

external experience. Riemann's view before referred to may I think be

said to be that, having in intellectu a more general notion of space (in fact

a notion of non-Euclidian space), we learn by experience that space (the

physical space of our experience) is, if not exactly, at least to the highest

degree of approximation, EucHdian space.

But suppose the physical space of our experience to be thus

only approximately Euclidian space, what is the consequence which

follows ? Isfot that the propositions of geometry are only approximately

true, but that they remain absolutely true in regard to that Euclidian

space which has been so long regarded as being the physical space of our

experience.

     It is interesting to consider two different ways in which, without
any modification at all of our notion of space, we can arrive at a system
of non-Euclidian (plane or two-dimensional) geometry; and the doing so
will, I think, throw some light on the whole question.

     First, imagine the earth a perfectly smooth sphere ; understand by
a plane the surface of the earth, and by a line the apparently straight

line (m fact an arc of a great circle) drawn on the surface ; what ex-

perience would in the first instance teach would be Euclidian geometry;
there would be intersecting lines which produced a few miles or so would
--10 EEPOET 1883.

seem to go on diverging : and apparently parallel lines which would

exhibit no tendency to approach each other ; and the inhabitants might

very well conceive that they had by experience established the axiom

that two straight lines cannot enclose a space, and the axiom as to

Aparallel lines.                                            more extended experience and more accurate measure-

ments would teach them that the axioms were each of them false ; and

that any two lines, if produced far enough each way, would meet in two

points : they would in fact arrive at a spherical geometry, accurately

representing the properties of the two-dimensional space of their ex-

perience. But their original Euclidian geometry would not the less be a

true system : only it would apply to an ideal space, not the space of their

experience.

Secondly, consider an ordinary, indefinitely extended plane ; and let

Weus modify only the notion of distance.                                                   measure distance, say, by a

yard measure or a foot rule, anything which is shoi-t enough to make the

fractions of it of no consequence (in mathematical language by an infini-

tesimal element of length) ; imagine, then, the length of this rule constantly
changing (as it might do by an alteration of temperature), but under the

condition that its actual length shall depend only on its situation on the

plane and on its direction : viz. if for a given situation and direction it

has a certain length, then whenever it comes back to the same situation

and direction it must have the same length. The distance along a given

straight or curved line between any two points could then be measured in

the ordinary manner with this rule, and would have a perfectly determin-

ate value : it could be measured over and over again, and would always

be the same                                                 but of course it would be the  distance, not  in the ordinary
                                                         ;

acceptation of the term, but in quite a different acceptation. Or in a

somewhat different way : if the rate of progress from a given point in a

given direction be conceived as depending only on the configuration of

the ground, and the distance along a given path between any two points

thereof be measured by the time required for traversing it, then in this

way also the distance would have a perfectly determinate value ; but it
would be a distance, not in the ordinary acceptation of the term, but

in quite a different acceptation. And corresponding to the new

notion of distance we should have a new, non-Euclidian system of plane

geometry ; all theorems involving the notion of distance would be

altered.

   We may proceed further. Suppose that as the rule moves away from

a fixed  central point of                                   the plane it becomes           shorter and shorter                                                                                         if  this
                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

shortening takes place with sufficient rapidity, it may very well be that a

distance which in the ordinary sense of the word is finite will in the new

sense be infinite ; no number of repetitions of the length of the ever-

shortening rule will be sufficient to cover it. There will be surrounding

the central point a certain finite area such that (in the new acceptation of

the term distance) each point of the boundary thereof will be at an

infinite distance from the central point ; the points outside this area you

incognita, or rather an unknowable land : in mathematical language, an

imaginary or impossible space : and the plane space of the theory will be

--that within the finite area that is, it will be finite instead of infinite.

   We thus with a proper law of shortening arrive at a system of non-

Euclidian geometry which is essentially that of Lobatschewsky. But in

so obtaining it we put out of sight its relation to spherical geometry : the

three geometries (spherical, Euclidian, and Lobatschewsky's) should be

regarded as raembers of a system : viz., they are the geometries of a

plane (two-dimensional) space of constant positive curvature, zero curva-

ture, and constant negative curvature respectively ; or again, they are the

plane geometries corresponding to three different notions of distance
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

in this point of view they are Klein's elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic

geometries respectively.

Next as regards solid geometry : we can by a modification of the

notion of distance (such as has "just been explained in regard to Lobat-

schewsky's system) pass from our present system to a non-Euclidian

system ; for the other mode of passing to a non-Euclidian system it
would be necessary to regard our space as a flat three-dimensional space

existing in a space of four dimensions (i.e., as the analogue of a plane

existing in ordinary space) ; and to substitute for such flat three-dimen-
sional space a curved three-dimensional space, say of constant positive or

negative curvature. In regarding the physical space of our experience

as possibly non-Euclidian, Riemann's idea seems to be that of modifying

the notion of distance, not that of treating it as a locus in four-dimen-

sional space.

    I have just come to speak of four-dimensional space. What meaning do
we attach to it ? Or can we attach to it any meaning ? It may be at once
admitted that we cannot conceive of a fourth dimension of space ; that
space as we conceive of it, and the physical space of our experience, are

alike three-dimensional ; but we can, I think, conceive of space as being
two- or even one-dimensional ; we can imagine rational beings living in a

one-dimensional space (a line) or in a two-dimensional space (a surface),

and conceiving of space accordingly, and to whom, therefore, a two-
dimensional space, or (as the case may be) a three-dimensional space
would be as inconceivable as a four-dimensional space is to us. And

very curious speculative questions arise. Suppose the one-dimensional
space a right line, and that it afterwards becomes a curved line : would
there be any indication of the change ? Or, if originally a curved line,
would there be anything to suggest to them that it was not a right line ?
Probably not, for a one- dimensional geometry hardly exists. But let the
space be two-dimensional, and imagine it originally a plane, and afterwards
bent (converted, that is, into some form of developable surface) or con-
verted into a curved surface : or imagine it originally a developable or
curved surface. In the former case there should be an indication of
the change, for the geometry originally applicable to the space of their
12 EEPOET-- 1883.

experience (our own Eaclidian geometry) would cease to be applicable
but tbe change could not be apprehended by tbem as a bending or deform-

ation of the plane, for this would imply the notion of a three-dimensional
space in which this bending or deformation could take place. In the latter
case their geometry would be that appropriate to the developable or curved
surface which is their space : viz. this would be their Euclidian geometry :

would they ever have arrived at our own more simple system ? But

take the case where the two-dimensional space is a plane, and imagine

the beings of such a space familiar with our own Euclidian plane geometry
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

if, a third dimension being still inconceivable by them, they were by their
geometry or otherwise led to the notion of it, there would be nothing to

prevent them from forming a science such as our own science of three-

 dimensional geometry.
      Evidently all the foregoing questions present themselves in regard to

ourselves, and to three-dimensional space as we conceive of it, and as
the physical space of our experience. ' And I need hardly say that the
first step is the difficulty, and that granting a fourth dimension we may
assume as many more dimensions as w^e please. But whatever answer
be given to them, we have, as a branch of mathematics, potentially, if

not actually, an analytical geometry of ?i-dimensional space. I shall
have to speak again upon this.

Coming now to the fundamental notion already referred to, that of

imaginary magnitude in analysis and imaginary space in geometry : I

connect this with two great discoveries in mathematics made in the

first half of the seventeenth century, Harriot's representation of an equa-

tion in the form f(x)=:0, and the consequent notion of the roots of an

equation as derived from the linear factoi's of /(a;), (Harriot, 1560-1621

his 'Algebra,' published after his death, has the date 1631), and

Descartes' method of coordinates, as given in the ' Geometric,' forming

a short supplement to his ' Traite de la Methode etc' (Leyden, 1037).

Taking the coefficients of an equation to be real magnitudes, it at

once follows from Harriot's form of an equation that an equation of the

order n ought to have n roots. But it is by no means true that

there are always n real roots. In particular, an equation of the second

order, or quadric equation, may have no real root ; but if we assume the

+ =existence of a root i of the quadric equation x^ 1 0, then the other
= --root is
             t ; and it is easily seen that every quadric equation (with

±real coefficients as before) has two roots, a hi, where a and h are real

Wemagnitudes.  are thus led to the conception of an imaginary magni-

+tude, a &', where a and /; are real magnitudes, each susceptible of any

positive or negative value, zero included. The general theorem is that,

taking the coefficients of the equation to be imaginary magnitudes, then

an equation of the order n has always n roots, each of them an imaginary

+magnitude, and it thus appears that the foregoing form a hi oi imagi-

nary magnitude is the only one that presents itself. Such imaginary
                                                                   ADDRESS.                                                                                13

magnitudes may be added or multiplied together or dealt with in any

manner                                       the result is   always a like  imaginary magnitude.                                                      They are
                                          ;

thus the magnitudes which are considered in analysis, and analysis is the

science of such magnitudes. Observe the leading character that the

imaginary magnitude a + hi is a magnitude composed of the two real
=magnitudes a and h (in the case 6
                                                                                it is the real magnitude a, and in

of considering, in place of real magnitudes, these imaginary or complex

magnitudes a + hi.

In the Cartesian geometry a curve is determined by means of the

equation existing between the coordinates (x, y) of any point thereof. In

the case                                     of a right  line this equation is  linear                          in the case of a circle                    or
                                                                                                             ;

more generally of a conic, the equation is of the second order ; and gener-
ally, when the equation is of the order n, the curve which it represents

is said to be of a curve of the order «. In the case of two o-iven curves

there are thus two equations satisfied by the coordinates (x, y) of the

several points of intersection, and these give rise to an equation of a

certain order for the coordinate x or y of a point of intersection. In

the case of a straight line and a circle this is a quadric equation ; it has

two roots, real or imaginary. There are thus two values, say of x, and

--to each of these corresponds a single value of y. There are therefore two

points of intersection viz. a straight line and a circle intersect always

in two points, real or imaginary. It is in this way that we are led

analytically to the notion of imaginary points in geometry. The conclu-

sion as to the two points of intersection cannot be contradicted by expe-

rience                                       take  a  sheet  of paper and draw on                               it the straight line and

circle, and try. But you might say, or at least be strongly tempted to

say, that it is meaningless. The question of course arises, What is the

meaning of an imaginary point ? and further. In what manner can the

notion be arrived at geometrically ?

There is a well-known construction in perspective for drawing lines

through the intersection of two lines, which are so nearly parallel as not

to meet within the limits of the sheet of paper. You have two given

lines which do not meet, and you draw a third line, which, when the

lines are all of them produced, is found to pass through the intersection

of the given lines. If instead of lines we have two circular arcs not

meeting each other, then we can, by means of these arcs, construct a

line                    and if                     on completing the circles it is found that the circles intersect
                     ;

each other in two real points, then it will be found that the line passes
through these two points : if the circles appear not to intersect, then

the line will appear not to intersect either of the circles. But the

geometrical construction being in each case the same, we say that in the

second case also the line passes through the two intersections of the circles.

    Of course it may be said in reply that the conclusion is a very natural

one, provided we                                      assume  the  existence    of  imaginary                   points                                and  that,
                                                                                                                                                   ;

this assumption not being made, then, if the circles do not intersect, it is

meaningless to assert that tlie line passes througli their points of inter-

section. The difficulty is not got over by the analytical method before
referred to, for this introduces difficulties of its own : is there in a plane
a point the coordinates of which have given imaginary values ? As a
matter of fact, we do consider in plane geometry imaginary points intro-
duced into the theory analytically or geometrically as above.

     The like considerations apply to solid geometry, and we thus arrive

at the notion of imaginary space as a locus in quo of imaginary points
and figures.

     I have used the word imaginary rather than complex, and I repeat
that the word has been used as including real. But, this once under-
stood, the word becomes in many cases superfluous, and the use of it
would even be misleading. Thus, ' a problem has so many solutions : '
this means, so many imaginary (including real) solutions. But if it
were said that the problem had ' so many imaginary solutions,' the word
' imaginary ' would here be understood to be used in opposition to real.
I give this explanation the better to point out how wide the application

--of the notion of the imaginary is viz. (unless expressly or by implication

excluded), it is a notion implied and presupposed in all the conclusions
of modern analysis and geometry. It is, as I have said, the fundamental
notion underlying and pervading the whole of these branches of mathe-

matical science.

I shall speak later on of the great extension which is thereby given

to geometry, but I wish now to consider the efiect as regards the theory

of a function. In the original point of view, and for the original purposes,

a function, algebraic or transcendental, such as \/x, sin x, or log a;, was

considered as known, when the value was known for every real value

(positive or negative) of the argument ; or if for any such values the

value of the function became imaginary, then it was enough to know that

for such values of the argument there was no real value of the function.

But now this is not enough, and to know the function means to know its

-- X --value of course, in general, an imaginary value + (T, for every

+imaginary value x iij whatever of the argument.

And this leads naturally to the question of the geometrical repre-

Wesentation of an imaginary variable.  represent the imaginary variable

+X iy by means of a point in a plane, the coordinates of which are
We(a;, y). This idea, due to Gauss, dates from about the year 1831.

thus picture to ourselves the succession of values of the imaginary variable

+X iy by means of the motion of the representative point : for instance,

the succession of values corresponding to the motion of the point along

Xa closed curve to its original position. The value -f- iY of the function

can of course be represented by means of a point (taken for greater con-

venience in a different plane), the coordinates of which are X,T.

   We may consider in general two points, moving each in its own

plane, so that the position of one of them determines the position of the
                                                          ADDRESS.                              15

otlier, and consequently the motion of the one determines the motion of the

other: for instance, the two points may be the tracing-point and the
pencil of a pentagraph. Ton may with the iirst point draw any figure

you please, there will be a corresponding figure drawn by the second

point : for a good pentagraph, a copy on a different scale (it may be)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

for a badly-adjusted pentagraph, a distorted copy : but the one figure

will always be a sort of copy of the first, so that to each point of the one

figure there will correspond a point of the other figure.

     In the case above referred to, where one point represents the value

X+X iy of the imaginary variable and the other the value + iY of some

+function f^x iy') of that variable, there is a remarkable relation between

the two figures : this is the relation of orthomorphic projection, the same

which presents itself between a portion of the earth's surface, and the

--representation thereof by a map on the stereographic projection or on

Mercator's projection viz. any indefinitely small area of the one ficrure is

represented in the other figure by an indefinitely small area of the same

shape. There will possibly be for different parts of the figure great

variations of scale, but the shape will be unaltered ; if for the one area the

boundary is a circle, then for the other area the boundary will be a

circle                           if for one it is an equilateral triangle, then for the other it will be
                              ;

an equilateral triangle.

I have for simplicity assumed that to each point of either figure there

corresponds one, and only one, point of the other figure ; but the general

case is that to each point of either figure there corresponds a determinate

number of points in the other figure ; and we have thence arising new and

very complicated relations which I must just refer to. Suppose that to

each point of the first figure there correspond in the second figure two

points                           say one of  them  is  a  red point, the  other a blue point ;  so that,
                              :

speaking roughly, the second figure consists of two copies of the first

figure, a red copy and a blue copy, the one superimposed on the other.

But the difficulty is that the two copies cannot be kept distinct from each

--other. If we consider in the first. figure a closed curve of any kind say,

--for shortness, an oval this will be in the second figure represented in

some cases by a red oval and a blue oval, but in other cases by an oval

half red and half blue ; or, what comes to the same thing, if in. the first
figure we consider a point which moves continuously in any manner at

last returning to its original position, and attempt to follow the corre-

spondmg points in the second figure, then it may very well happen that,

for the corresponding point of either colour, there will be abrupt changes

mof position, or say jumps, from one position to another; so that,°to

obtain the second figure a continuous path, we must at intervals allow

the point to change from red to blue, or from blue to red. There are in
the first figure certain critical points called branch-points (Verzioeigungs-
:punUe),^ and a system of lines connecting these, by means of which the

colours in the second figure are determined ; but it is not possible for me

to go further into the theory at present. The notion of colour has of
16 EEPOET-- 1883.

course been introduced only for facility of expression ; it may be proper

to add that in speaking of the two figures I bave been following Briot

and Bouquet rather than Riemann, whose representation of the function

of an imaginary variable is a different one.

I have been speaking of an imaginary variable +(x iy), and of a
= X ++function ^(x iy)
                        iT of that variable, but the theory may equally

+well be stated in regard to a plane curve : in fact, the x iy and the

X -1- iY are two imaginary variables connected by an equation ; say their
=values are u and v, connected by an equation ¥{u, v)
                                                       ; then, regard-

ing tt, V as the coordinates of a point in piano, this will be a point on the

curve represented by the equation. The curve, in the widest sense of the

expression, is the whole series of points, real or imaginary, the coordinates
of which satisfy the equation, and these are exhibited by the foregoing
corresponding figures in two planes ; but in the ordinary sense the curve

is the series of real points, with coordinates «, v, which satisfy the

equation.

     In geometry it is the curve, whether defined by means of its equa-
tion, or in any other manner, which is the subject for contemplation and
study. But we also use the curve as a representation of its equation
that is, of the relation existing between two magnitudes x, y, which are
taken as the coordinates of a point on the curve. Such employment of

--a curve for all sorts of purposes the fluctuations of the barometer, the
--Cambridge boat races, or the Funds is familiar to most of you. It is in

like manner convenient in analysis, for exhibiting the relations between
any three magnitudes x, y, z, to regard them as the coordinates of a
point in space ; and, on the like ground, we should at least wish to regard
any four or more magnitudes as the coordinates of a point in space of a
corresponding number of dimensions. Starting with the hypothesis of
such a space, and of points therein eacb determined by means of its
coordinates, it is found possible to establish a system of w-dimensional
geometry analogous in every respect to our two- and three-dimensional
geometries, and to a very considerable extent serving to exhibit the

relations of the variables. To quote from my memoir ' On Abstract

Geometry ' (1869) : ' The science presents itself in two ways : as a legiti-
mate extension of the ordinary two- and three-dimensional geometries,
and as a need in these geometries and in analysis generally. In fact,
whenever we are concerned with quantities connected in any manner,
and which are considered as variable or determinable, then the nature of
the connection between the quantities is frequently rendered more intel-
ligible by regarding them (if two or three in number) as the coordinates
of a point in a plane or in space. For more than three quantities there
is, from the greater complexity of the case, the greater need of such a
representation ; but this can only be obtained by means of the notion of
a space of the proper dimensionality ; and to use such representation we

require a corresponding geometry. An important instance in plane

geometiy has already presented itself in the question of the number of
curves which satisfy given conditions ; the conditions imply relations
between the coeflScients in the equation of the curve ; and for the better
understanding of these relations it was expedient to consider the

coefficients as the coordinates of a point in a space of the proper

dimensionality.'

     It is to be borne in mind that the space, whatever its dimensionality
may be, must always be regarded as an imaginary or complex space
such as the two- or three-dimensional space of ordinary geometry ; the
advantages of the repi'esentation would otherwise altogether fail to be

obtained.

     I have spoten throughout of Cartesian coordinates ; instead of these
it is in plane geometry not unusual to employ trilinear coordinates, and

these may be regarded as absolutely undetermined in their magnitude
viz. we may take x, y, z to be, not equal, bat only proportional to the

distances of a point from three given lines ; the ratios of the coordinates

(a;, 2/, z) determine the point ; and so in one-dimensional geometry, we
may have a point determined by the ratio of its two coordinates x, y, these
coordinates being proportional to the distances of the point from two

fixed points ; and generally in ^-dimensional geometry a point will be de-
termined by the ratios of the (n-fl) coordinates («, y, z . . .). The
corresponding analytical change is in the expression of the original

magnitudes as fractions with a common denominator ; we thus, in place

of rational and integral non-homogeneous functions of the original vari-
ables, introduce rational and integral homogeneous functions (quantics)

--of the next succeeding number of variables viz. we have binary quantics

corresponding to one- dimensional geometry, ternary to two-dimensional

geometry, and so on.

It is a digression, bat I wish to speak of the representation of points

or figures in space upon a plane. In perspective we represent a point in

space by means of the intersection with the plane of the picture (suppose

a pane of glass) of the line drawn from the point to the eye, and doing

this for each point of the object we obtain a representation or picture of

the object. But such representation is an imperfect one, as not deter-

mining the object : we cannot by means of the picture alone find out the

form of the object ; in fact, for a given point of the picture the corre-

sponding point of the object is not a determinate point, but it is a point

anywhere in the line joining the eye with the point of the picture. To

determine the object we need two pictures, such as we have in a plan and

elevation, or, what is the same thing, in a representation on the system of

Monge's descriptive geometry. But it is theoretically more simple to

consider two projections on the same plane, with different positions of the

eye : the point in space is here represented on the plane by means of two

points which are such that the line joining them passes through a

fixed point of the plane (this point is in fact the intersection with

1883.  C
18 EEPOET-- 1883.

tlie plane of the picture of the line joining the two positions of the

eye) ; the figure in space is thus represented on the plane by two figures,
which are such that the lines joining corresponding points of the two

figures pass always through the fixed point. And such two figures com-

pletely  replace  the  figure  in  space                             we  can  by means                                                                                                               of  them  perform
                                                                  ;

on the plane any constructions which could be performed on the figure in

space, and employ them in the demonstration of properties relating to

Asuch figure.     curious extension has recently been made : two figures

in space such that the lines joining corresponding points pass through a

fixed point have been regarded by the Italian geometer Veronese as repi'e-

sentations of a figure in four- dimensional space, and have been used for

the demonstration of properties of such figure.

I referred to the connection of Mathematics with the notions of

space and time, but I have hardly spoken of time. It is, I believe, usually

considei'ed that the notion of number is derived from that of time ; thus

Whewell in the work referred to, p. xx, says number is a modification of

tbe conception of repetition, which belongs to that of time. I cannot

recognise that this is so : it seems to me that we have (independently, I

should say, of sjDace or time, and in any case not more depending on time

than on space) the notion of plurality ; we think of, say, the letters a, h, c,

-- --&c., and thence in the case of a finite set for instance a, h, c, d, e we

arrive at the notion of number ; coordinating them one by one with any
other set of things, or, suppose, with the words first, second, &c., we find

that the last of them goes with the word fifth, and we say that the number                                                                                                                                                       I

=of things is five : the notion of cardinal number would thus appear to

be derived from that of ordinal number.

Questions of combination and arrangement present themselves, and

it might be possible from the mere notion of plurality to develope a

branch of mathematical science ; this, however, would apparently be of a

very limited extent, and it is difficult not to introduce into it the notion

of number ; in fact, in the case of a finite set of things, to avoid asking the

question, How many ? If we do this, we have a large enough subject,

including the partition of numbers, which Sylvester has called Tactic.

From the notion thus arrived at of an integer number, we pass to that

of a fractional number, and we see how by means of these the ratio of

any two concrete magnitudes of the same kind can be expressed, not

with absolute accuracy, but with any degree of accuracy we please : for

instance, a length is so many feet, tenths of a foot, hundredths, thousandths,

&c. ; subdivide as you please, no7i constat that the length can be expressed

accurately,  we have in fact incommensurables                                                                                                                                                        as to the part which these
                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

"play in the Theory of Numbers, I shall have to speak presently : for the

moment I am only concerned with them in so far as they show that

Mve cannot from the notion of number pass to that which is required

in analysis, the notion of an abstract (real and positive) magnitude

susceptible of continuous variation. The difficulty is got over by a

Wepostulate.    consider an abstract (real and positive) magnitude, and

regard it as susceptible of continuous variation, without in anywise

concerning ourselves about the actual expression of the magnitude by a

numerical fraction or otherwise.

    There is an interesting paper by Sir W. R. Hamilton, 'Theory of

Conjugate Functions, or Algebraical Couples: with a preliminary and

elementary Essay on Algebra as the Science of Pure Time,' 1833-35

(Trans. R. I. Acad. t. 17), in which, as appears by the title, he purposes

to show that algebra is the science of pure time. He states there, in the

General Introductory Remarks, his conclusions : first, that the notion of
time is connected with existing algebra ; second, that this notion or

intuition of time may be unfolded into an independent pure science and,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

third, that the science of pure time thus unfolded is coextensive and

identical with algebra, so far as algebra itself is a science ; and to sustain
his first conclusion he remarks that ' the history of algebraic science shows

that the most remarkable discoveries in it have been made either expressly
through the notion of tivie, or through the closely connected (and in some

sort coincident) notion of continuous progression. It is the genius of

algebra to consider what it reasons upon asflotving, as it was the genius

of geometry to consider what it reasoned on as fixed. . . . And generally
the revolution which Newton made in the higher parts of both pure and

applied aJgebra was founded mainly on the notion of fl,uxion, which
involves the notion of time.' Hamilton uses the term algebra in a very
wide sense, but whatever else he includes under it, he includes all that

in contradistinction to the Differential Calculus would be called algebra.
Using the word in this restricted sense, I cannot myself recognise the

connection of algebra with the notion of time : granting that the notion of
continuous progression presents itself, and is of importance, I do not see

that it is in anywise the fundamental notion of the science. And still less

can I appreciate the manner in which the author connects with the notion

++of time his algebraical couple, or imaginary magnitude a hi (a hx/ --1,

as written in the memoir).

I would go further : the notion of continuous variation is a very

fundamental one, made a foundation in the Calculus of Fluxions (if not

always so in the DifPerential Calculus) and presenting itself or implied

throughout  in  mathematics                                                                        and  it  may  be  said  that  a  change of  any
                                                                                                :

kmd takes place only in time ; it seems to me, however, that the changes

which we consider in mathematics are for the most part considered

quite in-espectively of time.

It appears to me that we do not have in Mathematics the notion of

time until we bring it there : and that even in kinematics (the science

of motion) we have very little to do with it ; the motion is a hypo-

thetical  one if the             system be                                                         regarded as actually          moving, the rate
                              ;

of motion is altogether undetermined and immaterial. The relative rates

of motion of the different points of the system are nothing else than the

ratios of purely geometrical quantities, the indefinitely short distances

                                                                                                        c2

simultaneously described, or which might be simultaneously described, by

these points respectively. But whether the notion of time does or does
not sooner enter into mathematics, we at any rate have the notion in
Mechanics, and along with it several other new notions.

    Regarding Mechanics as divided into Statics and Dynamics, we

have in dynamics the notion of time, and in connection with it that of

velocity : we have in statics and dynamics the notion of force ; and also a

notion which in its most general form I would call that of corpus : viz.

this may be the material point or particle, the flexible inextensible string

or  surface,  or  the rigid body,  of ordinary mechanics                                                                                                    the incompressible

deserving of consideration in any general treatise of mechanics is a

developable or skew surface with absolutely rigid generating lines, but

which can be bent about these generating lines, so that the element of

surface between two consecutive lines rotates as a whole about one of them.

We have besides, in dynamics necessarily, the notion of mass or inertia.
   We seem to be thus passing out of pure mathematics into physical

science ; but it is difficult to draw the line of separation, or to say of

large portions of the ' Principia,' and the ' Mecanique celeste,' or of the

whole of the ' Mecanique analytique,' that they are not pure mathematics.

It may be contended that we first come to physics when we attempt to

make out the character of the corpus as it exists in nature. I do not

at present speak of any physical theories which cannot be brought under

the foregoing conception of mechanics.

    I   must  return  to  the Theory     of  Numbers                                        the                                                             fundamental    idea  is
                                                                                         ;

here integer number : in the first instance positive integer number, but

which may be extended to include negative integer number and zero.

We have the notion of a product, and that of a prime number, which is

not a product of other numbers ; and thence also that of a number as

Wethe product of a determinate system of prime factors.                                                                                                     have here the

elements of a theory in many respects analogous to algebra : an equation

--is to be solved that is, we have to find the integer values (if any)

which satisfy the equation ; and so in other cases : the congruence nota-

tion, although of the very highest importance, does not affect the

character of the theory.

    But as already noticed we have incommensurables, and the con-

Wesideration of these gives rise to a new universe of theory.                                                                                               may take

into consideration any surd number such as\/i!, and so consider numbers

of the form a 4- &\/'^, (c^ and h any positive or negative integer numbers

not excluding zero) ; calling these integer numbers, every problem which
before presented itself in regard to integer numbers in the original and
ordinary sense of the word presents itself equally in regard to integer

numbers in this       new sense  of the  word                           of course all definitions must be
                                                                     ;

altered accordingly : an ordinary integer, which is in the ordinary sense
                                                                                                            ADDEESS.                                 21

of the word a prime number, may very well be the product of two

+integers of the form a &\/2, and consequently not a prime number in

the new sense of the word. Among the incommensnrables which can be

thus introduced into the Theory of Numbers (and which was in fact first
so introduced) we have the imaginary i of ordinary analysis : viz. we may

+consider numbers a hi {a and h ordinary positive or negative integers,

not excluding zero), and, calling these integer numbers, establish in

regard to them a theory analogous to that which exists for ordinary real
integers. The point which I wish to bring out is that the imaginary i
does not in the Theory of Numbers occupy a unique position, such as it
does in analysis and geometry ; it is in the Theory of Numbers one out of
an indefinite multitude of incommensurables.

I said that I would speak to you, not of the utility of mathematics

in any of the questions of common life or of physical science, but rather

of the obligations of mathematics to these different subjects. The con-

sideration which thus presents itself is in a great measure that of the

history of the development of the different branches of mathematical

science in connection with the older physical sciences, Astronomy and

Mechanics : the mathematical theory is in the first instance suggested by

some question of common life or of physical science, is pursued and

studied quite independently thereof, and perhaps after a long interval

comes in contact with it, or with quite a different question. Geometry

and algebra must, I think, be considered as each of them originating in

--connection with objects or questions of common life geometry, notwith-

standing its name, hardly in the measurement of land, but rather from the

contemplation of such forms as the straight line, the circle, the ball, the

top (or sugar-loaf) : the Greek geometers appropriated for the geometrical

forms corresponding to the last two of these, the words (rcpalpa and KiLfoe,

our cone and sphere, and they extended the word cone to mean the

complete figure obtained by producing the straight lines of the surface

both ways indefinitely. And so algebra would seem to have arisen from

the sort of easy puzzles in regard to numbers which may be made, either

in the picturesque forms of the Bija-Ganita with its maiden with the

beautiful locks, and its swarms of bees amid the fragrant blossoms, and

the one queen-bee left humming around the lotus flower ; or in the more
prosaic form in which a student has presented to him in a modern text-

book a problem leading to a simple equation.

    The Greek geometry may be regarded as beginning with Plato

(B.C. 430-347)                                                                             the  notions of  geometrical  analysis,  loci,  and  the  conic
                                                                                        :

sections are attributed to him, and there are in his Dialogues many very

interesting allusions to mathematical questions : in particular the passage

in the ' TheEetetus,' where he affirms the incommensurability of the sides

of certain squares. But the earliest extant writings are those of Euclid

(B.C. 285) : there is hardly anything in mathematics more beautiful

than his wondrous fifth book ; and he has also in the seventh eighth,

ninth and tenth books fully and ably developed the first principles of
the Theory of Numbers, including the theory of incommensurables.

We Lave next Apollonius (about B.C. 247), and Archimedes (b.c. 287-

212), both geometers of the highest merit, and the latter of them the

founder of the science of statics (including therein hydrostatics) : his
dictum about the lever, his ' EvprjKa,' and the story of the defence of

Syracuse, are well known. Following these we have a worthy series of
names, including the astronomers Hipparchus (b.c. 160) and Ptolemy
(a.d. 125), and ending, say, with Pappus (a.d. 400), but continued by their

Arabian commentators, and the Italian and other European geometers of

the sixteenth century and later, who pursued the Greek geometry.
     The Greek arithmetic was, from the want of a proper notation,

singularly cumbrous and difficult ; and it was for astronomical purposes
superseded by the sexagesimal arithmetic, attributed to Ptolemy, but
probably known before his time. The use of the present so-called Arabic
figures became general among Arabian writers on arithmetic and astro-

nomy about the middle of the tenth century, but was not introduced into
Europe until about two centuries later. Algebra among the Greeks is

represented almost exclusively by the treatise of Diophantus (a.d. 150), in
fact a work on the Theory of Numbers containing questions relating to
square and cube numbers, and other properties of numbers, with their
solutions ; this has no historical connection with the later algebra, intro-
duced into Italy from the East by Leonardi Bonacci of Pisa (a.d. 1202-
1208) and successfully cultivated in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries
by Lucas Paciolus, or de Burgo, Tartaglia, Cardan, and Ferrari. Later

on, we have Vieta (1540-1603), Harriot, already referred to, "Wallis,

and others.
     Astronomy is of course intimately connected with geometry ; the most

simple facts of observation of the heavenly bodies can only be stated in
geometrical language : for instance, that the stars describe circles about

the pole-star, or that the different positions of the sun among the fixed

stars in the course of the year form a circle. For astronomical calcula-
tions it was found necessary to determine the arc of a circle by means of

its chord : the notion is as old as Hipparchus, a work of whom is

referred to as consisting of twelve books on the chords of circular arcs
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

we have (a.d. 125) Ptolemy's 'Almagest,' the first book of which contains
a table of arcs and chords with the method of construction ; and among

other theorems on the subject he gives there the theorem afterwards
inserted in Euclid (Book VI. Prop. D) relating to the rectangle contained
by the diagonals of a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle. The Arabians

made the improvement of using in place of the chord of an arc the sine,

or half-chord of double the arc ; and so brought the theory into the form
in which it is used in modern trigonometry : the before-mentioned
theorem of Ptolemy, or rather a particular case of it, translated into the

notation of sines, gives the expression for the sine of the sum of two arcs

in terms of the sines and cosines of the component arcs ; and it is thus the
             ADDRESS.                                                                         23

fundamental theorem on the subject. "We have in the fifteenth and

sixteenth centuries a series of mathematicians who with wonderful en-

thusiasm and perseverance calculated tables of the trigonometrical or
circular functions, Purbach, Miiller or Regiomontanus, Copernicus,

Reinhold, Maurolycus, Vieta, and many others ; the tabulations of the

functions tangent and secant are due to Eeinhold and Maurolycus re-

spectively.

Logarithms were invented, not exclusively with reference to the calcu-

lation of trigonometrical tables, but in order to facilitate numerical calcu-
lations generally ; the invention is due to John Napier of Merchiston,

who died in 1618 at 67 years of age ; the notion was based upon refined

mathematical reasoning on the comparison of the spaces described by

two points, the one moving with a uniform velocity, the other with a

velocity varying according to a given law. It is to be observed that

Napier's logarithms were nearly but not exactly those which are now

called (sometimes Napierian, but more usually) hyperbolic logarithms
those to the base e ; and that the change to the base 10 (the great step
by which the invention was perfected for the object in view) was indicated
by Napier but actually made by Henry Briggs, afterwards Savilian Pro-
fessor at Oxford (d. 1630). But it is the hyperbolic logarithm which is
mathematically important. The direct function e" or exp. x, which has
for its inverse the hyperbolic logarithm, presented itself, but not in a
prominent way. Tables were calculated of the logarithms of numbers,

and of those of the trigonometrical functions.

     The circular functions and the logarithm were thus invented each for
a practical purpose, separately and without any proper connection with

each other. The functions are connected through the theory of imaginaries
and form together a group of the utmost importance throughout mathe-
matics : but this is mathematical theoiy ; the obligation of mathematics

is for the discovery of the functions.

     Forms of spirals presented themselves in Greek architecture, and
the curves were considered mathematically by Archimedes ; the Greek
geometers invented some other curves, more or less interesting, but re-

Acondite enough in their origin. curve which might have presented itself

to anybody, that described by a point in the circumference of a rolling
carriage-wheel, was first noticed by Mersenne in 1615, and is the curve
afterwards considered by Roberval, Pascal, and others under the name of
the Roulette, otherwise the Cycloid. Pascal (1623-1662) wrote at the age

of seventeen his ' Essais pour les Coniques ' in seven short pages, full of new
views on these curves, and in which he gives, in a paragraph of eight

lines, his theorem of the inscribed hexagon.

Kepler (1571-1630) by his empirical determination of the laws of

planetary motion, brought into connection with astronomy one of the

forms of conic, the ellipse, and established a foundation for the theory of

gravitation. Contemporary with him for most of his life, we have Galileo

(1564-1642), the founder of the science of    dynamics                                        and closely follow-
                                                                                           ;

ing upon Galileo we have Isaac Newton (1643-1727) : the ' Philosopliiae
naturalis Principia Mathematica ' known as the ' Principia ' was first pub-

lished in 1687.

The physical, statical, or dynamical questions which presented them-

selves before the publication of the ' Principia ' were of no particular
mathematical difficulty ; but it is quite otherwise with the crowd of

interesting questions arising out of the theory of gravitation, which,

in becoming the subject of mathematical investigation, have contributed

Wevery much to the advance of mathematics.  have the problem of two

bodies, or, what is the same thing, that of the motion of a particle about a

fixed centre of force, for any law offeree ; we have also the (mathematically

very interesting) problem of the motion of a body attracted to two or

more fixed centres of force ; then, next pi'eceding that of the actual solar

--system the problem of three bodies ; this has ever been and is far beyond

the power of mathematics, and it is in the lunar and planetary theories

replaced by what is mathematically a different problem, that of the
motion of a body under the action of a principal central force and a
disturbing force : or (in one mode of treatment) by the problem of
disturbed elliptic motion. I would remark that we have here an instance

in which an astronomical fact, the observed slow variation of the orbit

of a planet, has directly suggested a mathematical method, applied to

other dynamical problems, and which is the basis of very extensive

modern investigations in regard to systems of differential equations.
Again, immediately arising out of the theory of gravitation, we have
the problem of finding the attraction of a solid body of any given
form upon a particle, solved by Newton in the case of a homogeneous

sphere, but which is far more difficult in the next succeeding cases of the

spheroid of revolution (very ably treated by Maclaurin) and of the ellipsoid

of three unequal axes : there is perhaps no problem of mathematics which

has been treated by as great a variety of methods, or has given rise to so

much interesting investigation as this last problem of the attraction of an

ellipsoid upon an interior or exterior point. It was a dynamical problem,

that of vibrating strings, by which Lagrange was led to the theory of the

representation of a function as the sum of a series of multiple sines and

cosines ; and connected with this we have the expansions in terms of
Legendre's functions P,,, suggested to him by the question just referred to

of the attraction of an ellipsoid the subsequent investigations of Laplace
                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

on the attractions of bodies differing slightly from the sphere led to the

functions of two variables called Laplace's functions. I have been speak-

ing of ellipsoids, but the general theory is that of attractions, which has

become  a  very wide  bi-anch  of  modern  mathematics                                                                        associated with it
                                                                                                                           ;

we have in particular the names of Gauss, Lejeune-Dirichlet, and Green

and I must not omit to mention that the theory is now one relating to

7i-dimensional space. Another great problem of celestial mechanics,

that of the motion of the earth about' its centre of gravity, in the most
                                                                    ADDRESS.                               25

simple case, that of a body not acted upon by any forces, is a very

interesting one in the mathematical point of view.

I may mention a few other instances where a practical or physical

question has connected itself with the development of mathematical

--theory. I have spoken of two map-projections the stereographic,

dating  from  Ptolemy                                          and  Mercator's  projection,  invented  by  Edward
                                                            ;

Wright about the year 1600 : each of these, as a particular case of the

orthomorphic projection, belongs to the theory of the geometrical repre-

sentation of an imaginary variable. I have spoken also of perspective,

and of the representation of solid figures employed in JVIonge's descriptive

geometry. Monge, it is well known, is the author of the geometrical
theory of the curvature of surfaces and of curves of curvature : he was

led to this theory by a problem of earthwork ; from a given area, covered
with earth of uniform thickness, to carry the earth and distribute it over

an equal given area, with the least amount of cartage. For the solution

of the corresponding problem in solid geometry he had to consider the

intersecting normals of a surface, and so arrived at the curves of curvature.

(See his 'Memoire sur les Deblais et les Remblais,' Mem. de I'Acad.,

1781.) The normals of a surface are, again, a particular case of a doubly
infinite system of lines, and are so connected with the modern theories of

congruences and complexes.

The undulatory theory of light led to Fresnel's wave-surface, a

surface of the fourth order, by far the most interesting one which had

Athen presented itself.                                        geometrical property of this surface, that of

having tangent planes each touching it along a plane curve (in fact, a

circle), gave to Sir W. E. Hamilton the theory of conical refraction.

The wave-surface is now regarded in geometry as a particular case of

Kumraer's quartic surface, with sixteen conical points and sixteen sin-

gular tangent planes.

    My imperfect acquaintance as well with the mathematics as the

physics prevents me from speaking of the benefits which the theory of

Partial Differential Equations has received from the hydrodynamical

theory of vortex motion, and from the great physical theories of heat,

electricity, magnetism, and energy.

     It is difficult to give an idea of the vast extent of modern mathematics.
This word ' extent ' is not the right one : I mean extent crowded with

--beautiful detail not an extent of mere uniformity such as an objectless

plain, but of a tract of beautiful country seen at first in the distance,

but which will bear to be rambled through and studied in every detail of

hillside and valley, stream, rock, wood, and flower. But, as for anything

--else, so for a mathematical theory beauty can be perceived, but not

explained. As for mere extent, I can perhaps best illustrate this by

speaking of the dates at which some of the great extensions have been
made in several branches of mathematical science.
26 REPORT-- 1883.

     As regards geometry, I have already spoken of the invention of the

 Cartesian coordinates (1637). This gave to geometers the whole series
of geometric curves of higher order than the conic sections : curves of the
third order, or cubic curves ; curves of the fourth order, or quartic curves

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

and so on indefinitely. The first fruits of it were Newton's ' Enumeratio
linearum tertii ordinis,' and the extremely interesting investigations of
Maclaurin as to corresponding points on a cubic curve. This was at once
enough to show that the new theory of cubic curves was a theory quite

as beautiful and far more extensive than that of conies. And I must

here refer to Euler's remark in the paper ' Sur une contradiction appa-
rente dans la theorie des courbes planes' (Berlin Memoirs, 1748), in
regard to the nine points of intersection of two cubic curves (viz. that
when eight of the points are given the ninth point is thereby completely
determined) : this is not only a fundamental theorem in cubic curves
(including in itself Pascal's theorem of the hexagon inscribed in a conic),

--but it introduces into plane geometry a new notion that of the point-

system, or system of the points of intersection of two curves.

   A theory derived from the conic, that of polar reciprocals, led to the

--general notion of geometrical duality viz. that in plane geometry the

point and the line are correlative figures ; and founded on this we have

Pliicker's great work, the ' Theorie der algebraischen Curven ' (Bonn,
1839),in which he establishes the relation which exists between the order
and class of a curve and the number of its different point- and line-
singularities (Pliicker's six equations). It thus appears that the true
division of curves is not a division according to order only, but according
to order and class, and that the curves of a given order and class
are again to be divided into families according to their singularities
this is not a mere subdivision, but is really a widening of the field of

investigation ; each such family of curves is in itself a subject as wide
as the totality of the curves of a given order might previously have
appeared.

    We ^mite families by considering together the curves of a given

Geschlecht, or deficiency ; and in reference to what I shall have to say on
the Abelian functions, I must speak of this notion introduced into
geometry by Riemann in the memoir ' Theorie der Abel'schen Punctionen,'
Crelle, t. 54 (1857). For a curve of a given order, reckoning cusps
as double points, the deficiency is equal to the greatest number

-- --^(n 1) (n 2) of the double points which a curve of that order can

have, less the number of double points which the curve actually has.
Thus a conic, a cubic with one double point, a quartic with three double

points, &c., are all curves of the deficiency ; the general cubic is a curve,

and the most simple curve, of the deficiency 1 ; the general quartic is a
curve of deficiency 3 ; and so on. The deficiency is usually represented
by the letter p. Riemann considers the general question of the rational
transformation of a plane curve : viz. here the coordinates, assumed to
be homogeneous or trilinear, are replaced by any rational and integral
                                                                                  ADDRESS.  27

functions, homogeneous of the same degree in the new coordinates

the transformed curve is in general a curve of a difierent order, with its

own system of double points ; but the deficiency p remains unaltered

and it is on this ground that he unites together and regards as a single
class the whole system of curves of a given deficiency p. It must not be
supposed that all such curves admit of rational transformation the one

into the other : there is the further theorem that any carve of the class

p>ldepends, in the case of a cubic, upon one parameter, but for                             upon

3p -- 3 parameters, each such parameter being unaltered by the rational

transformation ; it is thus only the curves having the same one para-

--meter, or Sp 3 parameters, which can be rationally transformed the one

into the other.

     Solid geometry is a far wider subject : there are more theories, and
each of them is of greater extent. The ratio is not that of the numbers

of the dimensions of the spaces considered, or, v.'hat is the same thing, of

--the elementary figures point and line in the one case point, line and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

--plane in the other case belonging to these spaces respectively, but it is

a very much higher one. For it is very inadequate to say that in plane

geometry we have the curve, and in solid geometry the curve and surface

a more complete statement is required for the comparison. In plane

geometry we have the curve, which may be regarded as a singly infinite

system of points, and also as a singly infinite system of lines. In solid

geometry we have, first, that which under one aspect is the curve, and
under another aspect the developable, and which may be regarded as a

singly infinite system of points, of lines, or of planes ; secondly, the

surface, which may be regarded as a doubly infinite system of points

or of planes, and also as a special triply infinite system of lines (viz. the

tangent-lines of the surface are a special complex) : as distinct particular

cases of the former figure, we have the plane curve and the cone ; and

as a particular case of the latter figure, the ruled surface or singly infinite

system of lines                                                                   we have besides the congruence, or doubly infinite system
                                                                               ;

of lines, and the complex, or triply infinite system of lines. But, even if

in solid geometry we attend only to the curve and the surface, there are

crowds of theories which have scarcely any analogues in plane geometry.
The relation of a curve to the various surfaces which can be drawn
through it, or of a surface to the various curves that can be drawn upon

it, is difierent in kind from that which in plane geometry most nearly cor-

responds to it, the relation of a system of points to the curves through

them, or of a curve to the points upon it. In particular, there is nothing

in plane geometry corresponding to the theory of the curves of curvature

of a surface. To the single theorem of plane geometry, a right line is

the shortest distance between two points, there correspond in solid

--geometry two extensive and difficult theories that of the geodesic lines

upon a given surface, and that of the surface of minimum area for

any given boundary. Again, in solid geometry we have the interesting
and diflicult question of the representation of a curve by means of

equations ; it is not every curve, but only a curve whicli is the complete
intersection of two surfaces, which can be properly represented by two

=equations (x, y. z, w)'" =: 0, (x, y, z, zy)" O, in quadriplanar coordinates

and in regard to this question, which may also be regarded as that of the
classification of curves in space, we have quite recently three elaborate

memoirs by Neither, Halphen, and Valentiner respectively.
      In ?^-dimensional geometry, only isolated questions have been con-

sidered. The field is simply too wide ; the comparison with each other
of the two cases of plane geometry and solid geometry is enough to show
how the complexity and difficulty of the theory would increase with each

successive dimension.

In Transcendental Analysis, or the Theory of Functions, we have all

that has been done in the present century with regard to the general
theory of the function of an imaginary variable by Gauss, Caachy,

Puiseux, Briot, Bouquet, Liouville, Biemann, Fachs, "Weiei'strass, and

others. The fundamental idea of the geometrical representation of an

+imaginary variable x iy, by means of the point having x, y for its

coordinates, belongs, as I mentioned, to Gauss ; of this I have already

spoken at some length. The notion has been applied to differential

equations in the modern point of view, the problem in regard to a
                                                             ;

given differential equation is, not so much to reduce the differential

equation to quadratures, as to determine from it directly the course of the

integrals for all positions of the point representing the independent

variable : in particular, the differential equation of the second order

leading to the hypergeometric series F(<!, /3, y, x) has been treated in

this  manner,  with  the  most interesting  results                                  the  function  so  deter-
                                                                                  ;

mined for all values of the parameters (a, /3, y) is thus becoming a known
function. I would here also refer to the new notion in this part of

tion, as defined by an infinite series of ascending powers, convergent for

--all finite values, real or imaginary, of the variable x or 1 j x c, and so

=having the one essential singular point x:= cc or a; c, as the case may

be : the memoir is published in the Berlin Abhandlungen, 1876.

     But it is not only general theory : I have to speak of the various special
functions to which the theory has been applied, or say the various known

functions.

      For a long time the only known transcendental functions were the

circular functions sine, cosine, &c. ; the logarithm i.e. for analytical

purposes the hyperbolic logarithm to the base e ; and, as implied therein,

the exponential function e'. More completely stated, the group comprises

the direct circular functions sin, cos, &c. ; the inverse circular functions

sin"' or arcsin, &c. ; the exponential function, exp. ; and the inverse

exponential, or logarithmic, function, log.

      Passing over the very important Eulerian integral of the second

kind or gamma-function, the theory of which has quite recently given

--rise to some very interesting developments and omitting to mention at all

--various functions of minor importance, "we come (1811-1829) to the very

wide groups, the elliptic functions and the single theta-functions. I give

the interval of date so as to include Legendre's two systematic works, the

'Exercises de Calcul Integral ' (1811-1816) and the ' Theorie des Fonctions

EUiptiques ' (1825-1828); also Jacobi's ' Pundamenta nova theorise Func-

tiontim Ellipticarum ' (1829), calling to mind that many of Jacobi's results

were obtained simultaneously by Abel. I remark that Legendre started

from the consideration of the integrals depending on a radical V'X, the

square root of a rational and integral quartic function of a variable x for
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

the function F is properly an inverse function, and in place of it Abel and

Jacobi each of them introduced the direct functions corresponding to

the circular functions sine and cosine, Abel's functions called by him

f,/, F, and Jacobi's functions siuam, cosam, Aam, or as they are also
written sn, en, dn. Jacobi, moreover, in the development of his theory of

transformation obtained a multitude of formulas containing q, a tran-

=scendental function of the modulus defined by the equation q e""-^" ·''',

and he was also led by it to consider the two new functions H, ©, which

(taken each separately with two different arguments) are in fact the

four functions called elsewhere by him 0,, ©2, ©3, 0^; these are the
so-called theta-fuuctions, or, when the distinction is necessary, the sino-le

theta-functions. Finally, Jacobi using the transformation sin ^ := sinam u,

expressed Legendre's integral of the second and third kinds as integrals
depending on the new variable m, denoting them by means of the letters

Z, n, and connecting them with his own functions H and © : and the

elliptic functions sn, en, dn are expressed with these, or say with

©1, ©2, ©3, ©4, as fractions having a common denominator.

It may be convenient to mention that Hermite in 1858, introducino-

into the theory in place of q the new variable m connected with it by the

=equation 2=6'"" (so that w is in fact iK' jK), was led to consider the three

functions 0(ij, \poj, yu), which denote respectively the values of X/¥, X/lc'

Aand ^\/ kk' regarded as functions of w.  theta-function, putting the

=argument 0, and then regarding it as a function of u), is what Professor

Smith in a valuable memoir, left incomplete by his death, calls an omeo-a-

function, and the three functions ^w, \p(jj, x<^ are his modular functions.
     The proper elliptic functions sn, en, dn form a system very analogous

to the circular functions sine and cosine (say they are a sine and two
separate cosines), having a like addition-theorem, viz. the form of this

theorem is that the sn, en and dn o£ x + y are each of them ex-

pressible rationally in terms of the sn, en and dn of x and of the sn,
en and dn o£ y; and in fact reducing itself to the system of the

=circular functions in the particular case k 0. But there is the

important difference of form that the expressions for the sn, en and
--30 EEPOKT 1883.

dn of X + y are fractional functions having a common denominator : this

is a reason for regarding these functions as the ratios of four functions

A B C, D, the absolute magnitudes of which are and remain indeter-

minate (the functions sn, en, dn are in fact quotients [©i, ©2, ©3] -^ ©4 of

the four theta-functions, but this is a farther result in nowise deducible

from the addition-equations, and which is intended to be for the moment

disregarded ; the remark has reference to what is said hereafter as to the

Abelian functions). But there is in regard to the functions sn, en, dn

(what has no analogue for the circular functions), the whole theory of

transformation of any order oi pi-ime or composite, and, as parts thereof,

the  whole theory  of  the modular  and  multiplier  equations                                              and this
                                                                                                         ;

theory of transformation spreads itself out in various directions, in

geometry, in the Theory of Equations, and in the Theory of Numbers.

Leavinf the theta-functions out of consideration, the theory of the proper

elliptic functions sn, en, dn is at once seen to be a very wide one.

     I assicn to the Abelian functions the date 1826-1832. Abel gave

what is called his theorem in various forms, but in its most general

form in the 'Memoire sur une propriete generale d'une classe tres-

etendue de Fonctions Transcendentes ' (1826), presented to the French

Academy of Sciences, and crowned by them after the author's death,

in the following year. This is in form a theorem of the integral

calculus, relating to integrals depending on an irrational function y

=determined as a function of x by any algebraical equation F(«, y)

whatever : the theorem being that a sum of any number of such integrals

is expressible by means of the sum of a determinate number p of like

=inteo-rals, this number p depending on the form of the equation ¥(x, ?/)

which determines the irrational y (to fix the ideas, remark that con-

sidering this equation as representing a curve, then p is really the deficiency

of the curve ; but as already mentioned, the notion of deficiency dates only
from 1857) : thus in applying the theorem to the case where y is the

square root of a function of the fourth order, we have in effect Legendre's

theorem for elliptic integrals F^ -f- F;^ expressed by means of a single

inteo-ral F/i, and not a theorem applying in foi'm to the elliptic functions

sn, en, dn. To be intelligible I must recall that the integrals belonging

to the case where y is the square root of a rational and integral function

of an order exceeding four are (in distinction from the general case)

termed hyperelliptic integrals : viz., if the order be 5 or 6, then these are

= =of the class p 2 ; if the order be 7 or 8, then they are of the class p 3,
^and so on ; the general Abelian integral of the class p 2 is a hyper-
=elliptic integral : but if j5 3, or any greater value, then the hyper-

elliptic integrals are only a particular case of the Abelian integrals of

the same class. The further step was made by Jacobi in the short but

very important memoir ' Considerationes generales de transcendentibus

Abelianis,' Crelle, t. ix. (1832) : viz. he there shows for the hyperelliptic

integrals of any class (but the conclusion may be stated generally) that the

direct functions to which Abel's theorem has reference are not functions of a
                                                               ADDRESS.                                                                                                                    31

single variable, such as the elliptic sn, en, or di],but functions ofp variables.

=Thus, in the case p 2, which .Tacobi specially considers, it is shown that

Abel's theorem has reference to two functions /\(w, v), Xi(ic, v) each of two

variables, and gives in effect an addition-theorem for the expression of

+ + +the functions X(u u', v v'), Xi(u u', v + v') algebraically in terms

of the functions \(u, v), Xi(u, v), \(u', v'), Xi(w', v').

     It is important to remark that Abel's theorem does not directly give,

nor does Jacobi assert that it gives, the addition-theorem in a perfect

=form. Take the case jj 1 : the result from the theorem is that we have a

+function X(ii), which is such that X(u v) can be expressed algebraically

in terms of X(u) and X(v). This is of course perfectly correct, sn(M-f v)

is expressible algebraically in terms of sn u, sn v, but the expression

-- -- -- V --involves the radicals \/l snhi, \/l ]c^snhi,, >/l sn^y,
                                                                                                                                                                                1 Ic'^snh  ;

but it does not give the three functions sn, en, dn, or in anywise amount

+to the statement that the sn, en and dn u otti v are expressible rationally

=in terms of the sn, en and dn of « and of v. In the case ^ 1, the rio-ht

number of functions, each of one variable, is 3, but the three functions

sn,  en and dn are properly considered as the ratios                             of 4 functions                                                                                 and so
                                                                                                                                                           ;

--in general, the right number of functions, each of 2^ variables, is 4p 1,

and these may be considered as the ratios of 4? functions. But notwith-

standing this last remark, it may be considered that the notion of the

Abelian functions of p variables is established, and the addition. theorem

for these functions in effect given by the memoirs (Abel 1826, Jacobi 1832)

last referred to.

   We =have next for the case p 2, which is hyperelliptic, the two ex-

tremely valuable memoirs, Gopel, ' Theoria transcendentium Abelianarnm

primi ordinis adumbratio l«va,' Crelle, t. xxxv. (1847), and Rosenhain,
Memoire snr les fonctions de deux variables et a quatre periodes qui sont

les inverses des integrales ultra-elliptiques de la premiere classe ' (1846),

Paris, Mem. Savans Etrang. t. xi. (1851), each of them establishing on

the analogy of the single theta-functions the corresponding functions of

two variables, or double theta-functions, and in connection with them the

theory of the Abelian functions of two variables. It may be remarked

that in order of simplicity the theta-functions certainly precede the
Abelian functions.

     Passing over some memoirs by "Weierstrass which refer to the o-eneral

hyperelliptic                           integrals,     any value  whatever,  we  come to                                                                                   Riemann,  who

His great memoir on the Abelian and theta-functions is the memoir already

incidentally referred to, ' Theorie der Abel'schen Functionen,' Crelle, t. 54

(1857)                                  but intimately connected therewith we have his Inaugural Disser-

nected with theta-functions of the proper arguments. The theory is pre-
sented in the broadest form ; in particular as regards the theta-functions,
the 4p functions are not even referred to, and there is no development as
to the form of the algebraic relations between the two sets of functions.

In the Theory of Equations, the beginning of the century may be re-

garded as an epoch. Immediately preceding it, we have Lagrange's ' Traite

des Equations Numeriques ' (1st ed. 1798), the notes to which exhibit the

then position of the theory. Immediately following it, the great work by

Gauss, the ' Disquisitiones Arithmeticse ' (1801), in which he establishes

the theory for the case of a prime exponent «, of the binomial equation

_ = --aj" 1
: throwing out the factor aj 1, the equation becomes an

--equation of the order n 1, and this is decomposed into equations

--the orders of which are the prime factors of ii 1. In particular,

Gauss was thereby led to the remarkable geometrical result that

--it was possible to construct geometrically that is, with only the ruler
--and compass the regular polygons of 17 sides and 257 sides respectively.

We have then (1826-1829) Abel, who, besides his demonstration of the

impossibility of the solution of a quintic equation by radicals, and his very

important researches on the general question of the algebraic solution of

equations, established the theory of the class of equations since called

Abelian equations. He applied, his methods to the problem of the divi-

sion of the elliptic functions, to (what is a distinct question) the division

of the complete functions, and to the very interesting special case of the

leminiscate. But the theory of algebraic solutions in its most complete
form was established by Galois (born 1811, killed in a duel 1832), who

for this purpose introduced the notion of a group of substitutions ; and

to him also are due some most valuable results in relation to another set

of equations presenting themselves in the theory of elliptic functions

viz. the modular equations. In 1835 we have Jerrard's transformation

of the general] quintic equation. In 1870 an elaborate work, Jordan's

' Traite des Substitutions et des Equations algebriques : ' a mere inspec-

mytion of the table of contents of this would serve to illustrate  proposi-

tion as to the great extension of this branch of mathematics.

    The Theory of Numbers was, at the beginning of the century, represented
by Legendre's 'Theorie des Nombres ' (1st ed. 1798), shortly followed by
Gauss's 'Disquisitiones Arithmeticse' (1801). This work by Gauss is,

Uto use complex numbers of the before-mentioned form, a + (a and h

positive or negative real integers, including zero), and the theory of these

Wenumbers was studied and cultivated by Lejenne-Dirichlet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   have thus

a new theory of these complex numbers, side by side with the former

We have thus a new and very general theory, including within itself

that of the complex numbers a-f-ii and a-l-6p. But a new phenomenon

presents itself ; for these special forms the properties in regard to prime

numbers corresponded precisely with those for real numbers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   a non-prime

In the general case this is not so, but the exception first presents itself for

number j3 is by definition not the product of two actual numbers, but in the
example just referred to the number p is the product of two ideal numbers

having for their cubes the two actual numbers A, B, respectively, and we

thus have jj^=AB. It is, I think, in this way that we most easily get some

notion of the meaning of an ideal number, but the mode of treatment (in

KummerV great memoir, ' Ueber die Zerlegung der aus Wurzeln der

Einheit gebildeten Complexen-Zahlen iu ihre Primfactoren, Crelle, t. xxxv.

1847) is a much more refined one ; an ideal number, without ever being
isolated, is made to manifest itself in the properties of the prime number

of which it is a factor, and without reference to the theorem afterwards

arrived at, that there is always some power of the ideal number which is

an actual number. In the still later developments of the Theory of Num-

bers by Dedekind, the units, or incommensurables, are the roots of any

irreducible equation having for its coefficients ordinary integer numbers,

and with the coefficient unity for the highest power of x. The question

arises, What is the analogue of a whole number ? thus for the very simple

case of the equation +a;'^ 3=0, we have as a whole number the apparently

+fractional form i(l (Vo) which is the imaginary cube root of unity,

Wethe p of Eiseustein's theory.      have, moreover, the (as far as appears)

wholly distinct complex theory of the numbers composed with the con-

gruence-imaginaries of Galois : viz. these are imaginary numbers assumed

to satisfy a congruence  which  is   not  satisfied  by  any real  number                                        for
                                                                                                              ;

instance the congruence a'- -- 2=0 (mod 5) has no real root, but we assume

= --an imaginary root i, the other root is then      i, and we then consider

the system of complex numbers a + hl (mod 5), viz. we have thus the 5^

numbers obtained by giving to each of the numbers a, h, the values 0, 1,

2, 3, 4, succeisively. And so in general, the consideration of an irreducible
congruence F(.i;)=0 (mod p.) of the order n, to any prime modulus j),

gives rise to an imaginary congruence root i, and to complex numbers

of the form a + hi + cr-- +7a"~\ where a, h, ...Jc are ordinary integers

=each 0, 1, 2, ·· p--1.

As regards the theory of forms, we have in tbe ordinary theory, in

addition to the binary and ternary quadratic forms, which have been very

thoroughly studied, the quaternary and higher quadratic forms (to

these last belong as very particular cases the theories of the repre-

sentation of a number as a sum of four, five or more squares), and also

binary, cubic and quartic forms, and ternary cubic forms, in x-egard to all

which something has been done ; the binary quadratic forms have been

+studied in the theory of the complex number., a hi.

A seemingly isolated question in the Theory of Numbers, the demon-

stration of Fermat's theorem of the impossibility for any exponent X greater

+ =than 3, of the equation x'' i/-^ i\ has given rise to investigations of

very great interest and difficulty.

     Outside of ordinary mathematics, we have some theories which must
be referred to : algebraical, geometrical, logical. It is, as in many other
                                                                                                                     AI1DUESS.                                                                                                                                                       35

cases, diflGicnlt to draw tlie line; we do in ordinary mathematics use

symbols not denoting quantities, which we nevertheless combine in

the way of addition and multiplication, +a l, and ab, and which may be

=such as not to obey the commutative law ah ha, in particular this is or

may be so in regard to symbols of operation ; and it could hardly be said

that any development whatever of the theory of such symbols of opera-

tion did not belong to ordinary algebra. But I do separate from ordinary

mathematics the system of multiple algebra or linear associative algebra,

developed in the valuable memoir by the late Benjamin Peirce,

'Linear Associative Algebra' (1870, reprinted 1881 in the American

Journal of Mathematics, vol. iv. with notes and addenda by his son, C. S.

Peirce)                                          we here consider symbols A, B, &c. which are linear functions of
                                              ;

a determinate number of letters or units i, j, I; /, &c., with coefficients

which are ordinary analytical magnitudes, real or imaginary (viz. the

+coefficients are in general of the form x iij, where i is the before-men-

V -tioned imaginary or                                                                                      1 of ordinary analysis). The letters i, j, &c.,

are such that every binary combination i-, ij, ji, &g. (the ij being in

general not =;7), is equal to a linear function of the letters, but under

the restriction of satisfying the associative law : viz. for each combina-
=tion of three letters y.l is

unique product of three or more letters                                                                                                                                                                                                                  or, what is  the  same thing, the

by linear functions of these units, so as to give rise, for the units finally

adopted, to a multiplication table of the most simple form ; and it is very

remarkable, how frequently in these simplified forms we have nilpotent or
=idempotent symbols {i^=0, or i^ i as the case may be), and symbols i, j,
=such that ij=ji
                                                                                                            ; and consequently how simple are the forms of the

multiplication tables which define the several systems respectively.

I have spoken of this multiple algebra before referring to various

geometrical theories of earlier date, because I consider it as the general

analytical basis, and the true basis, of these theories. I do not realise

to myself directly the notions of the addition or multiplication of two

lines, areas, rotations, forces, or other geometrical, kinematical, or

mechanical entities                                                                                         and 1 would formulate a                                                                                                                      general theory as  follows  :

consider any such entity as determined by the proper number of para-

establish by definition the notion of the sum of the two entities, and that

of the product (in a determinate order, when the order is material) of the

two entities. The value of the theory in regard to any kind of entity

would of course depend on the choice of a systeiii of units, i,j, Ic . . with
such laws of combination as would give a geometrical or kinematical or

mechanical significance to the notions of the sum and product as thus

defined.

Among the geometrical theories referred to, we have a theory (that of

R. Hamilton's very valuable and important theory of Quaternions ; the

theories developed in Grassmann's ' Ausdehnungslehre,' 1841 and 1862 -

Clifford's theory of Biquaternions, and recent extensions of Grassmann's

theory to non-Euclidian space, by Mr. Homersham Cos. These different

theories have of course been developed, not in anywise froni the point of

view in which I have been considering them, but from the points of view

of their several authors respectively.

     The literal symbols x, y, &c., used in Boole's ' Laws of Thought ' (1854),.

to represent things as subjects of our conceptions, are symbols obeying the

laws of algebraic combination (the distributive, commutative, and associative

laws) but which are such that for any one of them, say x, we have x--x^=Of

this equation not implying (as in ordinary algebra it would do) either

x=0 or else a;=l. In the latter part of the work relating to the Theory

of Probabilities there is a difficulty in making out the precise meaning of

the symbols, and the remarkable theory there developed has, it seems to

Ame, passed out of notice, without having been properly discussed. paper

by the same author, ' Of Propositions numerically definite ' (' Camb. Phil.

Trans.' 18G9) is also on the borderland of logic and mathematics. It

would be out of place to consider other systems of mathematical logic,
but I will just mention that Mr. C. S. Peirce in his ' Algebra of Logic '

(American Math. Journal, vol. iii.) establishes a notation for relative

terms, and that these present themselves in connection with the systems

of units of the linear associative algebra.

Connected with logic, but primarily mathematical and of the highest

importance, we have Schubert's 'Abzilhlende Geometric' (1878). The

Howgeneral question is,  many curves or other figures are thei'e which satisfy

given conditions ? for example, How many conies are there which touch

each of five given conies ? The class of questions, in regard to the conic
was first considered by Chasles, and we have his beautiful theory of the

characteristics /.(, r, of the conies which satisfy four given conditions
questions relating to cubics and quartics were afterwards considered by

Maillard and Zeuthen ; and in the work just referred to the theory has
become a very wide one. The noticeable point is that the symbols used

by Schubert are in the first instance, not numbers, but mere logical

symbols: for example, a letter jf denotes the condition that a line shall cut
                                     ADDRESS.                       37

a given line ; rj'^ that it shall cut each of two given lines ; and so in other

cases and these logical              symbols ai-e  combined together by algebraical

laws : they first acquire a numerical signification when the number of

conditions becomes equal to the number of parameters upon which the

figure in question depends.

In all that I have last said in regard to theories outside of ordinary

mathematics, I have been still speaking on the text of the vast extent of
modern mathematics. In conclusion I would say that mathematics have
steadily advanced from the time of the Greek geometers. Nothing is lost
or wasted ; the achievements of Euclid, Ai-chimedes, and ApoUonius are as

admirable now as they were in their own days. Descartes' method of co-
ordinates is a possession for ever. But mathematics have never been culti-

vated more zealously and diligently, or with greater success, than in this

--century in the last half of it, or at the present time : the advances made

bave been enormous, the actual field is boundless, the future full of hope.

In regard to pure mathematics we may most confidently say :

Yet I doubt not tlirongh the ages one increasing purpose runs,

And tlie thoughts of men are widened with the process of the suns.

   Sir William Thomsox, Professor Ayrton, Mr. J. Perry, Professor

   W. Gr. Adams, Lord Kayleigh, Professor Jenkin, Dr. 0. J. Lodge,

   appointed for the purpose of constructing and issuing practical

   Standards for tcse in Electrical Measurements.
The Committee report that, in accordance with suggestions made at the
last meeting of the British Association, arrangements have now been
completed for testing resistance coils at the Cavendish Laboratory and
issuing certificates of their value. These arrangements have been made
by Lord Rayleigh and Mr. Glazebrook, and the report contains an account
by the latter of the methods employed and the conditions under which
the testing is undertaken, in order that those who use such coils may have
a more exact estimate of the value of the test.

     The standards at the laboratoiy belonging to the Association, the
values of which have been recently tested, are all single units. The best
of these were all compared among themselves, originally by Hockin
(' British Association Report,' 1867), and again by Chrystal and Saunder
(Report, 1876), and more recently, at various tempei'atures between about
0° C. and 25° C. by Mr. Fleming in 1879-1881, and a chart has been con-
structed, from Avhich the resistance of any one coil at a given temperature

between these limits can be determined. On this chart a curve is drawn

for each coil ; the ordinates of the curve represent resistances, while

the abscissae give the temperatures. The temperatures at which the
various resistances were originally each one B. A. Unit are known for
the respective coils. For these temperatures the ordinates of the curves
drawn ought to be the same, and the corresponding resistance one B. A.
Unit. Mr. Fleming finds, however, that this is not the case. The resis-
tances of the eight coils examined at the temperatures at which they were
--42 KEPOET 1883.

originally said to be correct are slightly different. The greatest difference

is that between the coils marked C and G, and amounts to "0011 mean

B. A. Unit.

     The mean of all these resistances at the respective temperatures is
taken as the mean B. A. Unit, and is that to which the resistance coils sent

for testing are referred.

ment himself. "We can state with the very highest exactness that the
resistance of the coil JI at a temperature A° C. is R. To obtain the tem-

perature coefficient accurately requires an amount of labour -which may

be quite unnecessary for the purpose for which the coil is to be used.
     But it is requisite to have standards of higher value than one unit,

and part of the Association grant has been used in obtaining coils of a

resistance of 10, 100, 10,00 and 100,00 units. Two of each value have

been purchased, so that by frequent comparison of one with the other

any accident to either may be checked.
    It remains, therefore, to describe how these coils are to be referred to

the standards. For the 10 units two methods have been adopted.
     There are at the Cavendish Laboratory two five-unit coils. Each of

these was compared with five single units placed in series, using Fleming's
bridge to make the comparison, and the ten-unit coil was compared with

these two in series.
     The values obtained by two observers at a temperature of 12° were :

9-98360  Lord Rayleigh.
9-98893  R. T. G.

     For the second method, suppose we have three coils each of resistance

+ + +about 3 units. Let there be 3 ", 3 /3 and 3 y, then the resistance
+ + +of the three in series is 9 a /^ y, and in multiple arc, if we neglect
+terms like a^ -Jy; &c.,itis 1 -J- i (a /3 4- y), thus neglecting tei-ms such

as £(2 i, the resistance of the three in series is just 9 times that of the three

in multiple ai-c.

     But the three coils in multiple arc are very nearly one unit, and can
be compared with the standards. If then we combine in series with the
same three one of the standards we have a resistance of approximately
ten units, whose value is very accurately known, and with which any

other ten-unit coil can be compared by the aid of Fleming's bridge.
Lord Rayleigh has devised an arrangement of mercury cups, by means

of which the changes indicated can be easily performed.

     The three 3-unit coils are wound on the same bobbin, and inclosed in
the same case. The sis electrodes project in pairs, and their ends lie
in a plane. The figure represents a piece of ebonite, through which,

holes are cut as indicated by the letters a, b, &c.
--44 REPORT 1883.

    On the under side of the ebonite, strong strips of copper, with their

faces well amalgamated, are screwed, forming with the holes in the
ebonite a series of cups, which are filled with mercury.

     The copper strips are cut, as shown in the figare, to make the
necessary connexions. The distances between the holes is such that the
electrodes of the three coils respectively fit into a b, c d, and ef, or into

a'b\c' d',SLTiie'f'.
     Connexion is made with the bridge by means of the cups A, B, while

the electrodes of the second single unit coil fit into g and h. In the first
position the three coils are in multiple arc, as will be seen from the
figui-e, and can be compared with a single unit, while in the second they
are in series with the other single unit, and can be compared with the

10 units.

     By this contrivance the 10 unit is referred to the single standard.

     To determine the value of a coil of 100 units, the three 3 units can be
replaced by three 30 units, and the single units by tens.

      This, however, is not the most convenient method for the total re-
sistance if the wire of the Fleming bridge in use is only -r}jj of a unit, thus

affording too small a range for the ready comparison of large resistances.

   --The following has been adopted: Pour coils are arranged as in a

Wheatstone's Bridge, one being the 100 units to be tested, two of the

others in opposite arms, two known 10 units, and the fourth a known

 single unit.

      These coils are all arranged in the same circular trough of water and

 their electrodes dip into four mercury cups.
      If all the coils are correct no current will traverse the galvanometer.

Of course in practice this condition is never realised. Either one of the

 ten units or the single unit is too great. Let us suppose it is the latter
 connect its two electrodes with the two electrodes of a resistance box and

 take out plugs from this till a balance is secured. Then if the resistance

of the ten units be Q and R, that of the single unit S, and the shunt W,

W +the resistance of the shunted arm is ---  -, and that of the 100

WNow, in practice, if Q, R, S are fairly accurate,  will be a large
W Wresistance, and an approximate knowledge of
                                             will suf&ce.     may

thus, for all we require, be taken from a resistance box by a good maker

which has stood for some time in the room in which the experiments are
Aconducted, the temperature being taken as that of the room.

has been ordered from Messrs. Elliott Brothers, to be used for this and

similar purposes.

     The same firm have also supplied a high resistance galvanometer for

the testing.

  WOf course if one of the ten unit coils is too great, then the shunt

must be put in with it.

     In accordance with the resolution of the Committee, a fee of 1/. Is.

has been charged for testing single units, and of 11. lis. 6d. for others.
     The only coils the testing of which is regularly undertaken are single

units and multiples of single units by some powers of 10.
     But though this is so, two standard ohms have been ordered, using

for the value of the B. A. unit -9807 ohms., and when they arrive and have

been tested, it will be easy to determine the value of coils which do not

--difiTer much from a real ohm. At present, without these standards the

coils actually used in the recent experiments at the Cavendish Laboratory

--have a resistance of about "1, 24, and 168 ohms the operation is trouble-

some. The simplest accurate method seems to be to combine in multiple
arc the real ohm, and one of the 100 B. A. unit standards, and to compare

the combination with a single unit.

     Dr. Muirhead also reports the completion of three air condensers as

standards of capacity.

     The Committee are glad to learn that Lord Rayleigh is continuing

his valuable researches at the Cavendish Laboratory with the view of
obtaining an absolute unit of current.

    They would ask in conclusion that they may be reappointed with the
addition of the names of Mr. H. Tomlinson and Professor W. Garnett

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

and that a further grant of 1001. may be made to meet the expense of

procuring standards of resistance in terms of the ohm.

Observations have been made in the artesian well at Southampton

Common by Mr. T. W. Shore, of the Hartley Institution, assisted by Mr.

J. Blount Thomas.

    The well was sunk to a depth of 1,31 7 feet many years ago, and has
remained closed for thirty-two years. It has now been re-opened, with

the view of being carried deep enough to obtain a supply of water which

will rise to the surface. The brick portion of the well is 563 feet deep,

Awith a diameter of 13 feet at the top and 7 feet at the bottom.  boring

with a 7i-iuch auger was made 754 feet deeper, giving a total depth of
1,317 feet. The water stands at 40 feet below the surface of the ground,
and a tube about 7i inches in diameter extends from the bottom of the
brick well to a few inches above the surface of the water. The thermo-
meter (an inverted Negretti maximum) was lowered through this tube

into the boring, and, to aid in carrying it past obstructions, it was
enclosed in a perforated cylindrical case of zinc, to which was attached
an elongated cylindrical weight, pointed at the lower end to enable it
to penetrate mud. The result showed that these precautions were

necessary, the zinc case and the lower part of the weight being deeply
sc"atched. The obstructions were chiefly met with at a depth of from
600 to 800 feet, in passing through the Upper Chalk.

Tlie thermometer was lowered very gradually, its descent occupying
 46 heport-- 1883.

 nearly 15 minutes, and it met with chalk mud at a depth of 1,210 feet

 from the surface of the ground. Here it Avas allowed to remain for
 30 minutes. It was then hauled up as slowly as it had gone down, and
 its indication was 69°"7 F.

      Observations wei'e next taken in the same manner at two smaller
 depths, the temperatures recorded being 57° F. at 400 feet and 65° '1 F.

 at 800 feet.
      The thermometer was then lowered again to the same depth as at

 first, and showed a temperature 2° '2 higher, but the lowering and raising
 on this occasion were hurried, as it was getting dai'k, and it is jDrobable
 that the 2° '2 of excess were owing to mercury which was shaken out of
 the bulb into the stem during the hauling up.

      These observations were made on January 18. After correspondence
 with the Secretary the thermometer was again lowered to the full depth,

--and allowed to remain there for a week. It was hauled up on February 1,

 and read 69°' 7 exactly the same as in the first observation.

     By way of verifying the explanation above given of the 2°'2 of ex-

 cess observed on the second occasion, Mr. Shore has tested the effect of
 shaking the thermometer by hand, and finds that he can, hy a few jerks,
 cause a sufficient quantity of mercury to pass through from the bulb to

make this difference.

      All these observations were taken before the water had been disturbed
by any preparations for continiiing the boring, and the temperature

69°'7 at 1,210 feet may be accepted as truly representing the temperature

of the ground at this depth.
     The mean annual temperature of the air at Southampton, as calcu-

lated by Mr. Shore from the daily observations at the Ordnance Survey

Ofi&ce, for the ten years 1872-1881, is 50°-0 F. If we allow, in accord-

ance with general experience, an excess of 1° in surface temperature of

the soil, we have an increase of 18°' 7 in 1,210 feet, which is at the rate

of 1° F. in 65 feet.

     Judging from past experience, not much reliance can bo placed on

the temperatures at interinediate depths, as they are liable to be largely
affected by convection. In the present case a comparison of the tem-
peratures at 800 feet and 1,210 feet gives an increase of 1° in 89 feet,
and a comparison of those at 400 feet and 1,210 feet gives 1° in

64 feet.
     The temperature of the surface of the water on January 18 was 55°.

This was only 40 feet below the surface of the ground, and the tempe-
rature of the air at the time was 49°. The surface of the ground is

140 feet above sea-level.
     The Council of the Mining Institute of Cornwall have undertaken a

series of obseiwations on underground temperatui-e in Dolcoath mine.
The thermometers (of the usual slow-action pattern) were supplied by
our Secretary at the expense of the Mining Institute, and the observations
were taken by Captain Josiah Thomas, the manager of the mine. It is
the deepest mine in Cornwall, and observations have been taken at six
points, at depths ranging from 252 to 2,124 feet.

     The deepest of these six observations was taken under very satis-
factory conditions, being in clean granite, about 90 feet distant from any
draught, and in newly-opened ground, only 24 feet from the end of the

--working. The temperature observed here the thermometer having
--been left for some days in a hole bored for it was 83° F., and the mean
        ON THE RATE OF INCREASE OF UNDERGROUND TEMPERATURE. 47

temperature of the air in ttie district for the past thirty-five years is

given by Dr. Hudson, of Redruth, as 51°-4. Assuming 52°-5 as the mean
temperature of the surface of the ground, we have an increase of 30°-5 in

2,124 feet, which is at the rate of 1° F. in 70 feet.
     This determination seems to be worthy of all confidence. The other

five observations were in places which had been for long periods exposed
to the air. The six observations, in order of depth, are given in the
following table. The last column shows the rate calculated by com-
paring the depth in question with an assumed temperature of 52°-5 at

the surface.

eight Lours in the hole, besides three hours allowed before insertion
whereas in the previous observation (1881 Report) it was only left six
hours in the hole, with ten or fifteen minutes before insertion. Assuming,

as before, a surface temperature of 49°, we have an increase of 35° in

2,880 feet, which is at the rate of 1° in 82 feet.
     Mr. Garside has also furnished the results of one year's observations

of surface temperature at two stations in Ashtou-under-Lyne, in the
immediate vicinity of the pits in which his observations have been taken.
One station is Croft House, in the centre of the town, 345 feet above sea-
level ; and the other is the District Infirmary, 501 feet above sea-level.
In both cases the data furnished are the monthly means, for the year
1882, of daily observations of the temperature of the soil at 4 feet deep

and 1 foot deep ; also of the maximum and minimum temperatures of
the air. The annual mean for the thermometer 4 feet deep is 47'"5 at

Croft House, and 45°-9 at the Infirmary. For the thermometer 1 foot

deep the numbers are 46°-2 and 45''-6 ; and for the half-sum of maximum
and minimum 48° '4 and 46° 6. Unless the year 1882 was exceptionally

cold, our assumption of a sm^face temperature of 49° would therefore
appear to be in excess of the truth ; but further time must be allowed to

settle this question.

     The Secretary has been consulted by the Trustees of the Lick
Observatory, about to be erected on a mountain in Califoimia, as to the
advisability of taking observations of underground temperature there,

and the best method to be followed. He has recommended observations

at various points for comparing the temperature at 3 feet deep with the

temperature of the air.

     One inverted Negretti-maximum and two slow-action thermometers

have been entrusted to Mr. T. W. Edgeworth David, Assistant Field
Geologist to the Mining Department in New South Wales; and two

slow-action thermometers have been supplied to the Engineering Depart-

ment of the South-Eastern Railway, for observations in the Channel

Tunnel.
      Since the publication of the ' Summary,' which accompanied last

year's Report, the Secretary has received from Dr. Stapff a communica-

tion which renders an important modification necessary in the results for

the St. Gothard and Mont Cenis Tunnels. In the ' Snmma,ry ' a con-
jectural correction was applied for the convexity of the mountain surfaces.
Dr. StapflP's calculations lead to the conclusion that a much larger allow-

ance must be made under this head. He deduces I'' F. in 85 feet as tlie

actual average rate of increase from the surface overhead to the tunnel

.and he calculates that at a depth below the tunnel sufficient to make the

isothermal surfaces sensibly plane, the increase is 1° F. in 57-8 feet._ His

method of calculation is very elaborate and laborious. He first divides

the whole length of the tunnel into sections, and, assuming that the
 isotherms are parabolas, investigates the parabolic isotherm for each
 section. Then, by combining these, he deduces a general law for the
 whole length, and infers that at the depth at which the isotherms are
 flattened out into straight lines the rate of increase is 1° F. for 57-8 feet

 of descent.

     As a check upon this very elaborate method, the secretary requested
 Dr. Stapff to furnish him with the actual observations both above
 ground and in the tunnel, for that portion which passes under the plain

 of Audermatt. This Dr. Stapff has kindly done, and these observations
         ON THE RATE OF INCEEASE OF UNDEEGROUND TEUPEEATURE. 49

strongly support Dr. Stapff 's deduction as against tbe deduction given in

ilie ' Summary ; ' the actual increase from the surface to the tunnel in
this part being at a much more rapid rate than 1° F. in 57'8 feet

namely, at 1° F. in 38 feet.

    As a guide for future estimates, it may be noted that the correcting
factor for reducing 85 feet to 57 '8 feet is almost exactly | ; but if we

compare the result merely with the observed increase beneath the crest of
the mountain, which was 1° F. in 100 feet, the correcting factor to be
applied to 100 feet is '58.

     If we assume 1° in 57'8 feet as the rate for the St. Gothard Tunnel,
and also for the Mont Cenis Tunnel, instead of the rates assumed in the
' Summary,' the efiect upon the general mean for all places will be to

m.ake it 1° F. in 60 feet, instead of 1° F. in 64 feet.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

since it is only in that country that any extensive system of observation
with systematic publication of results ' exists. This at least has proved

to be the case with our committee. On communication with General

Strachey, it was found that the India Office was anxious to obtain
advice as to the reduction of observations and publication of results,

and that Major A. W. Baird, R.E., the officer in charge at Poona of the

Tidal Department of the Survey of India, felt the desirability of instruc-

--tion witli regard to several points. More recently, in a resolution dated,

Simla, June 1, 1883 : ' The Government of India notices -with pleasure

that the tidal observations, in addition to their practical value for the re-

quirements of navigation, are now furnishing information which is found
to be of much scientific value.' The resolution then refers to a paper on

the rigidity of the earth, which was read at tte last meeting of the

Association.

    During 1882 Major Baird M^as in Europe, and Sir William Thomson
was kind enough to permit me to arrange a meeting with Major Baird, in

December, at his house in Glasgow, in order to discuss the subject, in

continuation of our previous correspondence.

   We then arrived at a general idea of the course of future procedure, and

also came to some agreement as to the changes of notation which it was
desirable to adopt. Subsequently, I proceeded to draw up a considerable
part of this Report, had it printed, and submitted it to Major Baird. I was
not at tliat time aware of the extent to which Mr. Roberts, of the Nautical

Almanac office, co-operated in England in the tidal operations, nor did I
know that he was not unfrequentl}' taking the advice of Professor Adams.

It was not until Major Baird had read what I had written, and expressed

his approval of the methods suggested, that these facts came to my
knowledge; but it must be admitted that it was through my own care-

lessness that this was so. I then found that Professor Adams decidedly

disapproved of the notation adopted, and would have preferred to throw

over the notation of the old Reports and take a new departure. The
notation of the old Reports seems to me also to be unsatisfactory, but,

seeing that Major Baird and his staff were already familiar with that

notation, I considered that an entire change would be impolitic, and that

it was better to allow the greater part of the existing notation to stand,
but to introduce modifications. The fact that Major Baird, who was
actually to work the method, approved of what had been written, and had

already mastered it, went far to prejudge the question, and Professor

Adams agreed, after discussion, that it would on the whole be best to
allow the work to go on in the lines in which it had been started.

     It has seemed proper to give this account of our operations in order

that Professor Adams may be relieved from responsibility for the ana-
lytical methods and notation here adopted. I may state, however, that
although the Report is drawn np in a form probably differing widely
from that which it would have had if Professor Adams had been the

author, yet he agrees with the correctness of the methods pursued. I

have been in constant commtinication with him for the past eight months,
and have received many valuable criticisms and suggestions.

     Mr. Roberts has been supervising the printing of a new edition of the

computation forms                                                                                                        they  have  undergone  some  modification  in  accord-

[Schedule Qj which are required in the reductions.

Major Baird returned to India in the spring of 1883, and, as I learn,

will shortly begin revising all the published results, so as to bring them
-- Woto one uniform system namely, that here recommended.
                                                                                                                                                                        are now

supplying Mr. Neison at Natal with a copy of this Report, and a few

copies of the computation forms will be sent to him for the purpose of

reducing the South African Tidal Observations.
     The general scope of this paper is to form a manual for the reduction

of tidal observations by the Harmonic Analysis inaugurated by Sir

William Thomson, and carried out by the previous Committee of the

British Association.'

      In the present Report the method of mathematical treatment differs

considerably from that of Sir Wilbam Thomson. ^ In particular, he has
followed, and extended to the diurnal tides, Laplace's method of referring

each tide to the motion of an astre ficfif in the heavens, and he considers

that these fictitious satellites are helpful in forming a clear conception of
the equihbrium theory of tides. As, however, I have found the fiction

rather a hindrance than otherwise, I have ventured to depart from this
method, and have connected each tide with an 'argument,' or an angle
increasing uniformly with the time and giving by its hourly increase
the ' speed ' of the tide. In the method of the astres fictlfs, the speed is
the difference between the earth's angular velocity of rotation and the
motion of the fictitious satellite amongst the stars. It is a consequence

of the difference in the mode of treatment, and of the fact that the elliptic

tides are here developed to a higher degree of approximation, that none
of the present Report is quoted from the previous ones.

     The Report of 1876 was not intended to be a final production, and it
did not contain any complete explanation of a considerable portion of the
numerical operations of the Harmonic Analysis

     The present Report is intended to systematise the exposition of the
theory of the harmonic analysis, to complete the methods of reduction,
and to explain the whole process.

    A careful survey of the methods hitherto in use has brought to

light a good many minor points in which improvements may be°intro-

dnced, but it has seemed desirable not to disturb the system, which is in
working order, more than can be helped. It has also appeared that the
published results have not been arranged in a form which lends itself to

a satisfactory examination of the whole method. This defect will, we
hope, now be remedied ; and, as above stated. Major Baird will revise the

Indian results.

     The first section refers to the notation, and contains a schedule of
nomenclature by initials of the several tides under examination. The

schedule is not, strictly speaking, in its proper position at the beginning,

because it involves the results of subsequent analysis, but the advantage
gained by having this list in a position of easy reference seems to out-
weigh the want of logic.

The forms for computation are privately printed for the India Office,

and are therefore inaccessible to the public.^ The type has been broken

up, and very few copies remain, but we shall be able to send copies to the

          § 1. The Notation ado])ted in the Tidal Reports.

In considering the notation to be adopted, nauch weight should be given

to the fact that a large mass of analysis and computation already exists

Wein a certain form.  have not thus got a tahida rasa to work on, but

had better accept a good deal that has grown up by a process of accre-

tion. It is certainly unfortunate that a dual system should have been

adopted, in which one set of letters are derived from the Greek and

another from the English.

     The letters y, o-, ??, ot are appropriated respectively to the earth's
angular velocity of rotation, to the mean motions of the moon, sun, and

lunar perigee. They form the initial letters of the words yj/, csXi'/rj;, ijXwc,

and perigee. There is also w, derived from the obliquity of the ecliptic.

In another category we have M, S, E, for the masses of the moon,

sun, and earth. It is unfortunate that the letter S should thus be con-

nected with the moon in cr ; but it has not been thought advisable to

change the notation in this matter. In this Report the already existing

notation is adhered to, as far as might be without inconvenience; but it

must be admitted that the notation is by no means satisfactory.

It is a matter of great practical utility to have a symbol for indi-

cating special tides. In the endeavour to meet this want initial letters

were assigned in the former Reports to each kind of  tide                          but, except in
                                                                                ;

Mthe case of and S, for the principal ' moon ' and ' sun' tides, the initials

had no connection with the tide. Although a new system of initials

might be devised which would have a direct connection with the tides

to which they refer, yet it has appeared best to adhere to the old initials

and to introduce certain new initials for the tides of long period and for

some tides now considered for the first time.

   --In the old notation the L tide was simply the tide of .speed 2y -- t et.

The values of this tide have probably been perturbed by another tide of

-- +speed 2y rT 'ar, and this tide is supposed also to be included in L.

Where it is necessary to refer to any other tides than those contained

in this schedule, it will be best to use the scientific nomenclature simply

--by speed. For example, there may be a compound tide 3y 2^; ; and
-- = -- +though this tide might be called SK, since 3y 27; 2(y 17) y, yet

reference to such a tide will be so infrequent as not to make the short

notation desirable.

     Both the old and the new initials are given in the following schedule.

TnE first step is the formation of the tide-generating potential of the

     For this purpose we require to find certain spherical harmonic func-

tions of the moon's coordinate?, with reference to axes fixed in the

earth.

Let A, B, C (Fig. 1) be such axes, C being

ABthe north pole and     the equator.

   A simple tide may be defined as a spherical hai-monic deformation of

the waters of the ocean which executes a simple harmonic motion in time.
Corresponding to this definition the expression for each term of the tide-
generating potential should consist of a solid spherical harmonic, multi-
plied by a simple time-harmonic.

     In (10) p*^?y, p2(i^-- jj2), &c., are solid spherical harmonics, and in

Vorder to complete the expression for it is necessary to develop the five

functions of X, Y, Z in a series of simple time-harmonics.

    It will be now convenient to introduce certain auxiliary functions,

namely

                           .2>-l3                                 ^

                                      COS o,

     Then from (5) and (9) we have                                                 (12)

   RThus when the functions *, '4', are developed as a series of time-

harmonics, the further development of the X-Y-Z functions consists in

substitution in (12).

    It will now be supposed that the moon moves in an elliptic orbit,
undisturbed by the sun. The tides which arise from the lunar inequali-

ties of the Evection and Variation will be the subject of separate treatment

below.

     The descending node of the equator on the lunar orbit will henceforth

be called ' the Intersection.'

     Let (T, be the moon's mean longitude measured in her orbit from the
intersection, and m, the longitude of the perigee measured in the_ same

way. It has been already defined that I is the moon's longitude in her

orbit measured from the intersection.

Hitherto no approximation has been admitted with regard to I, the

obliquity of the lunar orbit to the equator.

The obliquity of the ecliptic is 23° 27'-3, and I oscillates between

5° 8'-8 greater and 5° 8'-8 less than that value. The value of q or sin i J,
when I is 23° 27'-3, is -203, and its square is -041, and its cube -0084.

The  eccentricity of  the lunar  orbit e=-0549                                                         hence q"^ is a little  smaller

than e.

     The preceding developments have been carried as far as e-, principally

on account of the terms involving ye^ which, as e is about ^'g, have

nearly the same magnitude as if the coeflBcient had been l,e.

     It is proposed, then, to regard q'^ and 5^ as of the same oi-der as e, and
to drop all terms of the order e^, except in the case where the numerical

factor is large. This rule will be neglected with regard to one term for

a special reason,  which  appears  below                               and                             for  another,  because the

numerical coefficient is just sufficiently large to make it worth retaining.

Adopting this approximation, we may write (17), (18), (19), thus,--

     Before proceeding to consider the tides due to lunar inequalities it
will be well to consider two pairs of terms in the expressions (20).

    First, in Z^-- Y^ we have the terms

           -- -- --^e^2 ^p2 cos (2x-- (T; wj 632 cos (2x-'T; + w,)]

The expression within [ ] may be written

  -- -- + -- --(p^ 6q^ cos 2'nr/; COS (2x (^/-- 'J^^/) 6^^ sin 2«7^ sin (2x », '=^,)

-- -- -- --=2^s/p^ l2'f cos 2'nr^ COS (2x »/ '=^/ -B) approximately;

where

                                  sm z-ET,                            (20')
             J--tan i2=-
                              ^cot'-^  COS 2'nr,                    .

Thus this pair of terms may be written                              (20")

    ^ - - -_iep4 {1_12 tan2 iJcos 2«r,} cos (2x ff/ =^/ B)

Secondly, in XZ we have the terms

        ++ 2«P2 [i^^ s^"^ (x-'^/-^/)+3 {p^-'f) sin (x-'^/ '=^/)]

This is approximately equal to

+ \ep^(l [4 cos =7^ sin (x-'^/)+2 sin ·or, cos (x-*^/)]        . .. (20"')

                 = + +ejj3g n/II I cos 2'=rj sin (x-ff^ Q)          . (20*0

    The object of the transformations (20"), (20"), which may seem

theoretically undesirable, is as follows :

X"Again, the pair of terms with arguments                                                  '^,±'^/ '"'iH appear in the

harmonic analysis with the single argument x~"n and the resultino-
numbers will necesf arily appear very irregular, unless compared with the

theoretical expression (20*").

   We will now consider the terms introduced by the two principal lunar

inequalities due to the disturbing action of the sun.

The Evection.

        Let 6 be the moon's longitude in the ecliptic,

             s the moon's mean longitude.
            p the mean longitude of the perigee.^
             h the sun's mean longitude.

           m the ratio of the sun's to the moon's mean motion.

Then that inequality in longitude and radius vector is represented by

                 6= s+\£me sin (s--2h+p)                                                                                                          (21)
                                                                                                                                                  (22)
        -- -=l+^g^mecos (s--2h+p)

     If we neglect the distinction between longitudes in the orbit and in

the ecliptic [which is in effect neglecting a term with coefficient
sin2(ix5° 9')], we Have from (21),

                                                                                           ?=»/+ Vme cos (s -- 2h+p) ;

whence

+cos(2Z+a)=cos(2flr^-j-a) + i55me [cos (2,r^ + s-2h+p a)

                                                                                           --cos (2(7^--s + 2h--p + a)]

And from (22) and the definitions of R, ^, * in (11),                                                                                             (23)

Then substituting from (23), (24), (25), in (12), and dropping the

    * p in this sense will easily be distinguished from                                    the jo used                  to            denote cos  1 1,

    It must be noticed that ^^^ me arises by tlie addition of the coefficient

of the Ejection in longitude to three halves of that in the reciprocal of

the radius vector ; that {'^ me is the difference of the same two quantities ;

and that */ one is three times the coefficient in the reciprocal of radius

vector. When the development of the lunar theory is carried to higher

orders these coefficients difi'er considerably from the amounts computed
from the first term, which alone occurs in the above analysis. Hence,
when these coefficients are computed, the fall values of the coefficients in
longitude and reciprocal of radius vector must be introduced. According

to Professor Adams, the full values of the coefficients are, in longitude

·022233, and in c/r -010022.

   mThe ratio of the mean motions is about -jJ^, and is therefore a little

greater than e, hence me is somewhat greater than e*. Thus we may

In this case also the values of the coefficients are actually considerably

greater  than the amounts as computed from the fii'st   terms                              and    regard

must be paid to this, as in the case of the Evection, when the values of

the coefBcients in the tidal expressions are computed. According to Pro-

fessor Adams, the full values of the coefficients are, in longitude ·011489

and in cjr -008249.

   We have now obtained in (20), (26), (27), the complete expressions

for the X-Y-Z functions in the shape of a series of simple time-harmonics
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

but they are not yet in a form in which the ordinary astronomical formulae

are applicable.

    Further substitutions will now be made, and we shall pass from the

potential to the he'ght of tide generated by the forces corresponding to

that potential.

    The axes fixed in the earth may be taken to have their extremities as

follows

   AThe axis on the equator in the meridian of the place of observation
ABof the tides ; the axis in the equator 90° east of ; the axis C at the

north pole.

     'Now i, t], 4 are the direction-cosines of the place of observation, and

if \ be the latitude of that place, we have

     Thus                  S=:cosX, »?=0, ^'=sin /\.

£--,y2=cos2,\,  ^=0, ,/;=0, 2i;':=sin2,\, ^ ('' + r-2,=)=i-sin2A.

                          + ^ (^-sin^A) i (X'^+Y^-2Z^)-]

The X-Y-Z functions being simple time-harmonics, the principle of

forced vibrations allows ns to conclude that the forces corresponding to V

will generate oscillations in the ocean of the same periods and types as

the terms in V, but of unknown amplitudes and phases.

62 REPORT-- 1883.

E is the earth's mass. It has been so chosen that if the equilibrium theory

of tides were fulfilled, with water covering the whole earth, the numerical

X-^-Zfactors in the  functions would be each unity. The alterations of

phase would also be zero, oi*, with land and sea as in reality, they might

be computed by means of the five definite integrals involved in Sir

William Thomson's amended equilibrium theory of tides.

The actual results of tidal analysis at any place are intended

(see below, § 5) to be presented in a series of terms of the form

H --f cos (V+u k), where dVjdtov n, 'the speed,' is the rate of increase

of the argument per unit time(say degrees per mean solar hour), and n,

Weis a constant.  require, therefore, to present all the terms of the

^-JI-2; functions as cosines with a positive sign. When, therefore, in
these functions we meet with a negative cosine we must change its sign

and add tt to the argument ; as the .V yL functions involve sines, we must

add ^TT to arguments of the negative sines, and subtract ^tt from the

arguments of the positive sines, and replace sines by cosines. The terms

+ --in the ^(.V^ l^- 2Z;') function require special consideration. The

--function of the latitude being ^ sin^X, it follows that whenin the northern

hemisphere it is high-water north of a certain critical latitude, it is low

water on the opposite side of that parallel; and the same is true of the

southern hemisphere. The critical latitude is that in which sin2X=^, or

in Thomson's amended equilibrium (') theory, where +sin^\=:^(l iJ3).
An approximate evaluation of ir, which depends on the distribution of

land and sea, given in § 848 of the second edition of Thomson and
Tait's ' Natural Philosophj-,' shows that the critical latitudes are 35° N.

and S. It will be best to adopt a uniform system for the whole earth,

and to regard high-tide and high-water as consentaneous in the equa-

torial belt, and of opposite meanings outside of the critical latitudes. In

--this Report we conceive the function always to be written ^ sin^A, so

that outside of the critical latitudes hig-h.tide is low-water. Accordinoflv

we must add tt to the arguments of the negative cosines (if any) which

--occur in the function g(A" + J3' 2Z.).

      In continuing the development, the A'-^-Z- functions will be written

in the form appropriate to the equilibrium theory, with water covering

the whole earth ; for the actual case it is only necessary to multiply by
the reducing factor, and to subtract the phase alteration k. As these are un-

known constants for each place, they would only occur in the development

as symbols of quantities to be deduced from observation. It will be under-

stood, therefore, that in the following schedules ' the argument ' is that

part of the argument which is derived from theory, the true complete

--argument being ' the argument ' ».·, where k is derived from observation.

   In this formula we suppose g to increase uniformly from the time

when the tidal observations begin.
     Since in all the tidal observations local mean solar time is used, it

will be better to substitute for g in terms of local mean solar time

and the sun's mean longitude. Let t be local mean solar time reduced to
angle, so that at noon C=0°. Let h be the sun's mean longitude ; here-

after we shall write ^, for the longitude of the sun's perigee.

   We shall now substitute from (32) and (34) in the A*-^^-Z- functions

(29), (30), (31) ; substitute from them in (28), and express the final result
in the form of three schedules (pp. 18, 19, 20).

     The schedules are arranged thus. First, there is the genei'al coefficient

^  _/'*                      a which multiplies  every term of  all  the schedules.  Secondly,

                          )

there are general coefficients one for each schedule, viz. cos^X for the

--semi-diurnal terms, sin 2X for the diiarnal, and ^ f sin^X for the terms

of long period. These three functions of the latitude of the place of

observation are the values at that place of three surface spherical har-

monic functions, which functions have the maximum value unity, at the

equator for the semi-diurnal, in latitude 4.5° for the diurnal, and at the

pole for the terms of long period.
     First, in each schedule there is a column of coefficients, functions of

I and e (and in two cases also of |)).
     In the second column is given the mean semi-range of the correspond-

incr term. This is approximately the value of the coefficient in the first

Wecolumn when I=w.                    forestall results given below so far as to state

that the mean value is to be found by putting I=w in the ' coefficient,'

   Thirdly, there is a column of arguments, linear functions of /, h, s,
                                                                 HARMONIC ANALYSIS OF TIDAL OBSERVATIONS.               65

--p, )', i. In B, i. 2t+(2h 2i-), and in B, ii. t+{h--y), are common to all

the arguments, and they are written at the top of the column of arguments.
The arguments are grouped in a manner convenient for subsequent

computations.

     Fourthly, there is a column of speeds, being the hourly increase of
the arguments in the preceding column, the numerical values of which
are added in a last column.

     Every term is indicated by the initial letters (see § 1) adopted for the
tide to which it corresponds, except in the case of certain unimportant
terms to which no initials have been appropriated.

     To write down any term : take the general coefficient ; the coefficient

for the class of tides ; the special coefficient, and multiply by the cosine
of the argument. The result is a term in the equilibrium tide (with
water covering the whole earth). The transition to the actual case by
the introduction of a factor and a delay of phase (to be derived from
observation) has been already explained.

     The solar tides.

    The expression for the tides depending on the sun may be written
down at once by symmetry. The eccentricity of the solar orbit is so
small, being '01 679, that the elliptic tides may be omitted, excepting the

larger elliptic semi-diurnal tide.

     The lunar schedule is to be transformed by putting s=7(, p'=Pi,
s^i'=0, <T=ri, 1^(0, e=ei, ·to-^ct,. In order that the compai'ison
of the importance of the solar tides with the lunar may be complete, the

#--same general coefficient                                                   a( *- ) will be retained, and the special

coefficient for each term will be made to involve the factor r^jr. Here

ri=:# '---, 8 being the sun's ma.ss.

With EIM=81 5,

The schedule [C] of solar tides is given on page 21.

The subsequent schedules [D] and [E] give all the tides of purely

astronomical origin contained in the previous developments, arranged

first in order of speed, and secondly in order of the magnitude of the

coefficient. As most of the observations of the tides are made at jilaces

remote from the pole, the coefficients of the tides of long period are

-- --written down with a general coefficient 1 3 sin^Z in place of i i} sin-/:

that is to say, the spherical harmonic function has the value unity at the

equator and two at the pole. In schedule [E] the tides K,, Iv2 originate

both from the moon and sun, but the lunar and solar parts are also

entered separately.

The coefficients of the evectional and variational tides are computed

from the full values to those inequalities.

In the schedule [E] the tides are marked which occur in the ' Tide-

predictcr                                                    of  the  Indian  Government  in  its  present  condition.

    A tide of greater importance than some of those retained here is that

referred to where the approximation with regard to 7 was introduced,

+ --viz. with speed 'iy T ro-; the value of its coefficient is ·00323. There

is also the larger variational diurnal tide, which has been omitted : it
would have a coefficient '00450 ; also an evectional termensual tide,

Y'/me ^ sin^ I cos (35 -- 2/i+p), with coefficient of magnitude '00292.

All other tides in a complete development as far as the second order of
small quantities, without any approximation as to the obliquity of the
lunar orbit, would have smaller coefficients than those comprised in the

above list. Such a development has been made by Professor J. C. Adams,
and the values of all the coefficients computed therefrom, in comparison

with the above.
      Besides the tides above enumerated, the predicter of the India

-- --Office also has the over-tides M4 and Mg, of speeds 4 (y (t), 6 (7 o"), and
the compound tides 2MS, 2SM, MS, of speeds +2y-- +4/T 2f;, 27 2<t-- 4»;,
-- -- --47 2o- 2»/, and the meteorological tides S,, Sa, of speeds y ?;, »/.

      If this schedule is worth anything, it seems probable that the India
Office predicter would do better with some other terra substituted for A.

     If further examination of the tidal records should show that the tide M,

is in reality regular, it should be introduced.

       § 3. Tides Depending on the Fourth Poiver of the Moon's Parallax.

The potential corresponding to these tides is

                  F=^p3 (5 (,os3 PM-f cos PM).

   Wc may obviously neglect the eccentricity of the lunar orbit, and it

will appear below, when the principal terms are evaluated, that the

declinational tides may be safely omitted.
    By these approximations we may put r=r, and J/j--O, and neglect

the terms in j/i, J/j which involve q-. Following the same plan as in

the previous development of § 2, we have, when M^-=0,

+ +i (I'n 'y'-4/j;2) (il/,2M2 + iU^)

The four functions of t, »;, :, in this expression are surface spherical
harmonics of the third order, and therefore, corresponding to these four
terms, there will be four tides of the tj'pes determined by those functions.

     Now, we have approxiraately

                    ili"i =jj2 cos (x-l),  -M.2= -X'~ sin (x  ·

From which we have

                     3/,3_3j/,jj/^2^^6 cos 3(x-0
                    3/1^+ M^M^^=f cos (x-0

                  HARMONIC ANALYSIS OF TIDAL OBSERVATIONS.            73

    Then, following the same procedure as before, we have for the height

of tide

                            +tV cos X (1-5 sin^A) .y cos (x-l)] · (35)
    Now, COS X(5 sin^ X -- 1) hasits maximum value --y^when cosX= j?^\/ 15

that is to say, when \=58° 54' ; thus we may write (35)

+ ^^N/15cosX(l-5sin-'A)^^^/15Qyos6iIcos[f+(/<-,)-(^,--i)]"|(36)

     In this expression observe that there is the same ' general coefficient '

outside [ ] as in the previous development ; that the spherical harmonics

cos^X, j\^ 15 cos X (5 sin^ X -- 1) have the maximum values unity, the first

at the equator and the second in latitude 58° 54'. The ' speeds ' of these

--two tides are respectively 3 (y o-) or 43°-4761563 per mean solar hour,

and --y <7, or 14°492052i per mean solar hour.
   --The coefficient of the tide 3(y o-), which is comparable with those in

the previous schedules [B], [C], [E], is

                  ^^f^cos^I,

--and the mean value of this function multiplied by cos 3 (i  i)  is  "00599
                                                                                                          ;
--also the coefficient of the tide (y »), likewise comparable with previous

coefficients, is

                  T^VlSg^COsHJ,

--and the mean value of this function multiplied by cos (>' s) is '00165.

     The expression for the tides is written in the form applicable to the
equatorial belt bounded by latitudes 26° 34' N. and S. (viz. where

sin Z=iV5). Outside of this belt, what may be called high tide, will

correspond with low water. The distribution of land on the earth will

probably, however, seriously disturb the latitude of evanescent tide.

    --It must be noticed that the y <t tide is comparatively small in the

equatorial belt, having at the equator only f- of its value in latitude
58° 54'.

     Referring to the schedule [E] of theoretical importance, we see that
the ter-diunml tide M3 would come in last but four on the list, and the

--diurnal tide M, (with rigorous speed y a) would only be about a half

of the synodic fortnightly variational tide.

     It thus appears that the ter-diurnal tide is smaller than some of the
tides not included in our approximation, and that the diurnal tide should
certainly be negligeable.

    The value of the M3 tide, however, is found with scarcely any trouble,

from the numerical analysis of the tidal observations, and therefore it is
proposed that it should still be evaluated.
--74 REPORT 1883.

            § 4. Meteorological Tides, Over-tides, and Compound Tides.

      Meteorological Tides.

   A rise and fall of water due to regular day and night breezes,

prevalent winds, rainfall and evaporation, is called a meteorological tide.
     All tides whose period is an exact multiple or sub-multiple of a mean

solar day, or of a tropical year, are affected by meteorological conditions.
Thus all the tides of the principal solar astronomical series S, with speeds

-- -- --y Tj, 2 (y ';), 3 (y >;), &c., are subject to more or less meteorological
--perturbation. Although the diurnal elliptic tide, S, or y >?, the semi-

annual and annual tides of speeds 2rj and >), are all probably quite insens-
ible as arising from astronomical causes, yet they have been found of
suflBcient importance to be included on the tide-predicter.

     The annual and semi-annual tides are of enormous importance in
some rivers ; in such cases the ter-annual tide (3»/) is probably also
important, although no harmonic analysis has been as yet made for it.

     In the reduction of these tides the arguments of the S series are t,
2f, St, &c., and of the annual, semi-annual, ter-annual tides are /;, 2h, Bh.
As far as can be foreseen, the magnitudes of these tides will be constant
from year to year.

        Over-tides.

    When a wave runs into shallow water its form undergoes a progres-

sive change as it advar.ces ; the front slope generally becomes steeper
and the back slope less steep. The most striking example of such a

change is when the tide runs up a river in the form of a ' bore.'

    A wave which in deep water presented an approximately simple

harmonic contour departs largely from that form when it has run into
shallow water. Thus in rivers the rise and fall of the water is not even
approximately a simple harmonic motion. From the nature of harmonic
analysis we are, hovrevcr, able to represent the motion by simple
harmonic oscillations, and thus to give the non-harmonic rise and fall of

tide in shallow water it is necessary to introduce a series of ovcr-tides
whose speeds are double, triple, quadruple the speed of the fiiudaraental

astronomical tide.

      The only tides, in which it has hitherto been thought necessary to
represent this change of form in shallow water, belong to the principal
lunar and principal solar series. Thus, besides the fundamental astro-

nomical tides Mo and S.,, the over-tides M4, M^, M,^, and S^, S5 have

been deduced by harmonic analysis.

     The height of the fundamental tide M2 varies from year to year,

according to the variation in the obliquity of the lunar orbit, and this
 variability is represented by the coefficient cos"* ^ I. It is probable that
 the variability of M4, Mg, M^, will be represented by the square, cube
 and fourth power of that coefficient.

      The law connecting the phase of an ovei'-tide with the height of the
 fundamental tide is unknown, and under these circumstances it is only
 possible to make the argument of the over-tide a multiple of the argu-
 ment of the fundamental, with a constant subtracted. If that constant
 is found to be the same from year to year, then it will be known that the
 phase of an over-tide is independent of the height of the fundamental tide.

      The following schedule gives the over- tides which must be taken into
 consideration, the notation being the same as before :

                  HARMOmC ANALYSIS OF TIDAL OBSEEVATIONS.

     The schedule [G] contains 36 speeds of compound tides : 9 of these-

fall into the category of astronomical or meteorological tides, 2 are re-

peated twice, and of the remaining 25 we need only consider, say, the

twelve most important.
     If either or both the component tides are of lunar origin, the height

of the compound tide will change from year to year, and will probably
vary proportionally to the product of the coefficients of the component

tides.

     For the purpose of properly reducing the numerical value of the com-
pound tides, we require not merely the speed, but also the argument.

     The following schedule gives the index of importance, argument and
speed of the compound tides.

     The coefficients are the products of the coefficients of the two tides to
be compounded.

                                                          [H.]

one year for prediction in future years can only be made by dividing up

the compound tide into several parts, according to its theoretical origin.

In order to do this it is necessary that the law should be known which

Aconnects the heights of a summation and a difference compound tide.

2SMlike difficulty arises from the fact that MSf and  are also variational

tides.

     In practice, however, the compound tide will generally be so small

thatkwe may pi'obably treat it as though it arose entirely in one way :

--and accordingly it is proposed to treat the tides 3y 2o- or MK, and
--·3y-- 4fr or 2MK, as though tbey arose entirely from Mg + K,, M4 Kj
respectively, and MSf and 2SM as though they were entirely compound

tides.

           § 5. The Method of Reduction of Tidal Observations.

The printed tabular forms on which the numerical harmonic analysis

of the tides is carried out are arransred so that the series of observations

to be analysed is supposed to begin at noon, or 0**, of the first day, and

to extend ibr a year from that time. It has not been found practicable

to arrange that the first day shall be the same at all the ports of

observation.

     Supposing n to be the speed of any tide in degrees per mean solar

hour, and t to be mean solar time elapsing since 0"^ of the first day ; then

Athe immediate result of the harmonic analysis is to obtain and B, two

heights (estimated in feet and tenths) such that the height of this tide

at the time t is given by

                           A B+cos nt  sin. nt.

The question then arises as to what further reductions it will be con-

venient to make, in order to present the results in the most convenient

form.

                                                                                                                -n

    First, let us put R=v/(A^ + B-), and tan 4=-t, then the tide is repre-

sented by

                           R cos (?!<-- 4).

   RIn this form is the semi-range of the tide in British feet, and if is

an angle such that ;'/*/ is the time elapsing after 0'' of the first day until
it is high-water of this ]iarticular tide.

     It is obvious that 4 may have any value from 0° to 3G0°, and that the

results of the analysis of successive years of observation will not be com-
parable with one another, when presented in this form.

      Secondly, let ns suppose that the results of the analysis are to be pre-

sented in a number of terms of the form

                           fHcos (F+h-k).

    Here F is a linear function of the moon's and sun's mean longitudes,

the mean longitude of the moon's and sun's perigees, and the local mean

solar time at the place of observation, reduced to angle at 15° per hour.

F increases nniformly with the time, and its rate of increase per mean

solar hour is the w of the first method, and is called the ' speed ' of the

tide.

     It is supposed that u stands for a certain function of the longitude
of the node of the lunar orbit at an epoch half a year later than 0** of the
         HAEMONIC ANALYSIS OF TIDAL OBSERYATIONS.                        79

first day. Strictly speaking, ti should be taken as the same fimction of
the longitude of the moon's node, varying as the node moves ; but as the

variation is but small in the course ot' a year, « may be treated as

a constant and put equal to an average value for the year, which average

value is taken as the true value of n at exactly mid-year. Together

V+u constitutes that function which has been tabulated as 'the argu-

ment ' in the schedules B, C, F, H.

    Since V+u are together the whole argument according to the

equilibrium theory of tides, with sea covering the whole earth, it follows

that (./» is the lagging of ths tide which arises from kinetic action,

friction of the water, imperfect elasticity of the earth, and the distribution

of land.

   HIt is supposed that is the mean value in British feet of the semi-

range of the particular tide in question.

     f is a numerical factor of augmentation or diminution, due to the
variability of the obliquity of the lunar orbit. The value of f is the

ratio of ' the coefficient ' in the column of coefficients of the preceding
schedules to the mean value of the same term. For example, for all the

solar tides f is unity, and for the principal lunar tide M2, f is equal to

ycos'' ^Ij cos* iw cos'* ; for as we shall see below, the mean value of this

term has a coefficient cos^ ^a> cos** i^i.

     It is obvious, then, that, if the tidal observations are consistent from

Hyear to yeai', and k should come out the same from each year's reduc-

tions. It is only when the results are presented in such a form as this

that it will be possible to judge whether the harmonic analysis is pre-

senting lis with satisfactory results. This mode of giving the tidal

results is also essential for the use of the tide-predicting machine.

   HWe must now show how to determine Rand (.- from and 4.

    It is clear that H=R/f, and the mode of determination of f from the

schedules has been explained above, although the proof has been deferred.

    VIf Va be the value of at 0^ of the first day, then clearly

So that

Thus the rule for the determination of c is : Add to the value of C the

valve of the argument at 0^ of the first day.

RIt is suggested that it will henceforth be advisable to tabulate and iT,
R --so as to give the results of harmonic analysis in the form cos (7it
                                                                                                                                            ;

H H --and also and k, so as to give it in the form f

the results will be comparable from year to year.

   A third method of presenting tidal results will be very valuable for

the discussion of the theory of tidal oscillations, although it is doubtful

whether it will at present be worth while to tabulate the results in this

Hproposed form. This method is to substitute for the of the second

method FK, where F is the mean value of the coefficient as tabulated in
--the column of coefficients in the schedules for example, in the case of M2
F=iwe should have
                   (1-- le^) cos'' ^10 cos" ii', and in the case of Sj we

F=^should have  When. 1 cos" | w.  this process is carried out it will

enable us to compare together the several K's corresponding to each of
the thpee classes of tides, but not the several classes hiter se.

    It migbt perhaps be advisable to proceed still further and to purify

K #--of the coeflScient  T-^ a, and of the function of the latitude, viz.

cos^X, sin 2\, i,-% sin^X, as the case may be. Then we should simply

be left with a numerical factor as a residuum, which would represent the

augmentation above or diminution below the equilibrium value of the

tide. This further reduction may, however, be left out of consideration
for the present, since it is superfluous for the proper presentation of the

results of harmonic analysis.
     I'or the purpose of using the tide-predicting machine the process of

H Rdetermining and k from and 4 has simply to be reversed, with the

diflerence that the instant of time to which the argument is to refer is 0^

of the first day of the new year, and we must take note of the different

value of u and f for the new year. Thus supposing F, to be the value of

V at 0'^ of the first day of the year to which the predictions are to apply,

and Ml, f 1, the values of u and f half a year after that 0**, we have

                                  R=fiH

RThis value of     will give the proper throw of the crank of the tide-

predicter, and ^ will give the angle at which the crank is to be set. Mr.

Roberts states, however, that the subtraction, in the predicter of the

+India OSice, of Fi tt, from k is actually performed on the machine, one

index being set at t: and the other at Fi +«!·

    "We learn also from him that one portion of the term m, has been

systematically neglected up to the present time: namely, that part which

--arises in the form r £ or its multiples. If in the schedules above we

were to write i=)' throughout we should arrive at the rule by which the

tide-predicter has hitherto been used.

    The above statement of procedure is applicable to nearly all the tides, J

but there are certain tides, viz. K,, Kj, which have their origins jointly I

The expression for the whole K, tide of luni-solar origin must, as we

see from the schedules B and C, § 3, be of the form

    If now we put

                   t, an v,'=  cos )' + S/M

these two terms may be written

                         R cos (< + /i-^n-- )''-k).

    --If 7(o be the sun's mean longitude at O^' of the first day, t+h h^ is

equal to yt, where t is now mean solar time measured from that O*' and

the two terms become

                            E. cos (yt--^).

But this is the form in which the results of harmonic analysis for the

total Ki tide is expressed in the first method.               (42)

    From (41) we have

    --In this formula Ji^ ^tt is V^ for the solar K, tide, and i' is a complex

function of the longitude of the moon's node, to be computed (as
explained below) from the second of (40).

    We must now consider the coefficient f.

    If Mo be the mean value of the lunar K] tide, then we know that its

Mratio to should according to theory be given by

      It appears that in using the tide-predicter ^Er. Roberts has been
hitherto using a process which is obviously incorrect, although the incor-

rectness has probably only led to very small errors. He has divided the

R of the Ki tide into two parts proportional to the O and P tides

respectively, as deduced for the same year by the harmonic analysis for
those tides. This process is incorrect in one respect, and not absolutely

satisfactory in another. It is incorrect, because] it is equivalent to the
treatment of r as zero in the formula

                           R2=M2 + S2 + 2MS cos r;

and it is unsatisfactory, because the theoretical ratio of            to P is

                                  r (1-- 5e^) sin I cos- ^J

    Again, he has divided R of K., into two parts proportional to thej

^I., and S2 tides. This is again incorrect. The incorrectness arises from|

a similar treatment of r as zero, and because the ratio of Mj to So is

                                              ^i(l-oei2;cos'»ia>'

Moreover, the S2 tide is probably liable to meteorological disturbance.

   We must here deem Q to form a part of the function u, for which a

     It has been shown that the tide Mi, in as far as it depends on the
fourth power of the moon's parallax, is too small to be worth including

in the numerical analysis.

   A table of values of E, >, I, for diffei-ent values of iV^ with oj=23° 27''3,

   We give below in § 12 a table for J, r, '£ for every 2° of N, computed

     The approximate formulee (53") will be of service hereafter.

On the Mean Values of the Coefficients in Schedules [B.].

In the three schedules [B] of lunar tides, ' the coefficients' are certain

functions of /, and there are certain terms in the arguments which are

Wefunctions of r and E-                          may typify all the terms by J cos (T+ u), where

J is a function of I, and u of r and £. If we substitute for / and u in terms

of w, i, N, and develop the result, we shall obtain a series of terms of

Nwhich the one independent of is, say, Ji cos T. Then /, is the mean

value of the semi-range of the tide in question. Such a development

may be cairied out rigorously, but it involves a good deal of analysis to

do so ; we shall therefore confine ourselves to an approximate treatment

of the question, using the formulss (53") for ^ and i'.

It may be proved that in no case does / involve a term with a sine of

an odd multiple of N, and the formula (54) or (55) show that in every

Nterm of sin ?t there will occur a sine of an odd multiple of ; whence it

follows that J sin u has mean value zero, and Ji is the term independent

N Jof in cos ti.

It may also be proved that in no case does cos u involve a term in ccs iV,

2Nand that the terms in cos                                  ai-e  all    of  order i^                                                also it appears that J
                                                                                                                                ;

always involves a term in cos ^V, and also terms in cos 2iV" of order /-.

Hence to the degree of approximation adopted, /, is equal to J^ cos u^,

where J^ is the mean value of J, and cos u^ the mean value of cos u.

In evaluating cos u^ from the formulae (53"), we may observe that

wherever sin- iV occurs it may be replaced by h ; for sin^ A'=:J-- i cos 2N,
and the cos 2^^ has mean value zero.

§ 8, On the Beducfions of the PuhlisJied Results of Tidal Analysis.

In the Tide Tables pablished by the Indian Government, it is stated

R -- Hthat each tide is expressed in the form
                                               cos (ni s), where                                          is the

semi-range in feet, n the speed of the tide, and tjn is the time in mean

solar hours which elapses, after an epoch appropriate to the tide, until the

next high-water of that tide. Tables are then given for E, and e at each

station for each j^ear.

    The mode of tabulation is the same as that followed in the Tidal
Reports of the British Association for 1872 and 1876.

     It is advisable that all the results should be reduced according to one
system, such that the observations of the several years and the values

for the several speeds of tide may be comparable infer se.

     In § 5 it has been proposed that the tide should be recorded in the
form

fHcos (F+«-K-)-

     It appears from the statements in the Reports for 1872 and 1876 and

from an examination of the reductions of the published results that the

Rf. of the tables is equal to k--u, and that the of the tables is equal to

f H. Thus in order to reduce the published results to proper forms, com-
parable inter se, it is necessary to add to e the appropriate u, and to divide

R by the proper f. Following this process we obtain at once the following

additive corrections to the e's to obtain the (c's. The values of 1 /f by which

the R's are to be multiplied to obtain the H's, are those given in the pre-

ceding schedule [I].

   HFor all tides not mentioned here, /c is identical with e, and with R.

henceforth treated, and to give the requisite information for the sub-

sequent use of the tide-predicting instrument.

     The tide-gauge furnishes us with a continuous graphical record of the
height of the water above some known datum mark for every instant of

time.

     It is probable that at some future time the Harmonic Analyser of

Professors James and Sir William Thomson ' may be applied to the tide-
curves. The instrument is nearly completed, and now lies in the Physical

Laboratory of the University of Glasgow, but it has not yet been put into

use. The treatment of the observations which we shall describe is the

numerical process used at the office of the Indian Survey at Poena, under

the immediate superintendence of Major A. W. Baird, R.E. The printed

forms for computation were admirably drawn up by Mr. Edward Roberts,

of  the ' Nautical Almanac '                                                                                                               Office                             but they have now undergone certain
                                                                                                                                                                           ;

small modifications in accordance with this Report. The work of compu-

tation is to a great extent carried out by native Indian computers. The
results of the harmonic analysis are afterwards sent to Mr. Roberts, who

works out the instrumental tide-predictions for the several ports for the
ensuing year. The use of that instrument requires great skill and care.
The results of the tidal reductions have hitherto been presented in a

somewhat chaotic form, and we believe that it is only due to Mr.
Roberts' knowledge of the manner in which the tidal results have been

treated that they have been correctly used for prediction. It may be

hoped that the use of the methods recommended in the present Report
will remove some of the factitious difficulties in the use of the instru-

ment.

    The first operation performed on the tidal record is the measurement

in feet and decimals of the height of water above the datum at every

mean solar hour. The period chosen for analysis is about one year, and

the first measurement corresponds to noon. It has been found im-

practicable to make the initial noon belong to the same day at the several

ports. It would seem, at first sight, preferable to take the measurements

at every mean lunar hour                                                                                                                   but  the                           whole of  the actual process in use is
                                                                                                                                        ;

based on measurements taken at the mean solar hours, and a chano-e to

lunar time would involve a great deal of fresh labour and expense.

    If T be the period of any one of the diurnal tides, or the double period

of any one of the semi-diurnal tides, it approximates more or less nearly

to 24 m. s. hours, and if we divide it into 24 equal parts, we may speak
Weof each as a T-hour.
                                                                                                                                           shall for brevity refer to mean solar time

as S-time.

    Suppose, now, that we have two clocks, each marked with 360°, or

24 hours, and that the hand of the first, or /S-ciock, goes round once in 24

(S-hours, and that of the second, or T-clock, goes round once in 24 T-hours,

and suppose that the two clocks are started at 0° or 0*> at noon of the

initial day. For the sake of distinctness, let us imagine that a T-hour is

longer than an ,S-hour, so that the T-clock goes slower than the /S-clock.

The measurements of the tide-curve give us the height of water exactly

at each S-hour                                                                      and it is required from these                                                                       data  to determine the
                                                                                 ;

height of water at each T-hour.

     For this end we are, in fact, instructed to count T-time, but are only

allowed to do so by reference to S-time, and, moreover, the time is
always to be specified as an integral number of hours.

            ' See Appendix, Thomson and Tait's iXat. PMI. 2n6. ed. 1883.
94 EEPORT-- 1883.

    Beginning, then, witli O'' of the first day, we shall begin counting 0, 1,

2, &c., as the T-hand cotnes up to its hour-marks. But as the /S'-hand
gains on the T-hand, there will come a time when the T-hand, being

+exactly at the p hour-mark, the S-hand is nearly as far as p h- When,
however, the T-hand has advanced to the p + 1 hour-mark, the S-hand
+will be a little beyond j;-F1 -|- : that is to say, a Httle less than half an

hour before jj-f 2. Counting, then, in T-time by reference to 8-lime, we

shall jump from p to p + 2. The counting will go on continuously for a

number of hours nearly equal to 2p, and then another number will be

dropped, and so on throughout the whole year. If it had been the T-hand

which went faster than the S-hand, it is obvious that one number would

Webe repeated at two successive hours instead of one being dropped.

may describe each such process as a ' change.'

Now, if we have a sheet marked for entry of heights of water accoi'd-

ing to T-hours from results measured at S-hours, we must enter the

fiJ-nieasurements continuously up to p, and we then come to a ' change,'
and dropping one of the S-series, we go on again continuously until

another ' change,' when another is dropped, and so on.

Since a ' change ' occurs at the time when a T-honr falls almost

exactly half way between two S-hours, it will be more accurate at a

' change ' to insert the two S'-entries which fall on each side of the truth.

If this be done the whole of the ,S-series of measurements is entered on

the T-sheet. Similarly, if it be the T-hand which goes faster than the

/S-hand, we may leave a gap in the T-sei'ies instead of duplicating an

entry. For the analysis of the T-tide there is therefore prepai'cd a sheet

arranged in rows and columns ; each row corresponds to one T-day, and

the columns are marked 0*^,  !·*,... 23^                                                    the O'^'s may be called T-noons.

A dot is put in each space for entry, and where there is a change two

dots are put if there is to be a double entry, and a bar if there is to be

no entry. Black vertical lines mark the end of each /S-day. These

black lines will of course fall into slightly irregular diagonal lines across

the page, and such lines are steeper and steeper the more nearly T-time

approaches to S-time. They slope downwards from right to left if the

T-hour is longer than the iS-hour, and the other way in the opposite case.

The ' changes ' also run diagonally, with a slope in the opposite direction

to that of the black lines.

   We annex a diminished sample of a part of a page drawn up for the

entry of the M-series of tides, in which jT-time is mean lunar time.

      In the form actually prepared for the computers, the horizontal lines
between the successive days are absent, and the place for each single
entry is indicated by a single dot.

     The incidence of the hours in the computation forms for the several
series was determined by Mr. Roberts.

     Since the first day is numbered 1, and the first hour 0*^, it follows that

the hourly observation numbered 74'' IP is the observation which com-

pletes a period of 73'' 12'^ of mean solar time since the beginning ; in fact,
to find the period elapsed since 0'' of the first day we must subtract 1 from
the number of the day and add one to the number of the hour. The

73'' 12'' of m. s. time, inserted at the foot of the form, is very neai-ly equal

to 71 days of mean lunar or M-time. For each class of tide there are five

pages, giving in all about 370 values for the height of the water at each

of the 24 special hours ; the number of values for each hour varies slightly
according as more or less ' changes ' fall into each column.

     The numbers entered in each column are summed on each of the five
pages; the five sets of results being summed, the results are then divided
each by the proper divisor for its column, and thus is obtained the mean
value for that column. In this way 21 numbers are found which give
the mean height of water at each of the 24 special hours.

      It is obvious that if this process were continued over a very long time
·we should in the end extract the tide under analysis from amongst all the
others, but as the process only extends over about a year, the elimination

of the others is not quite complete.

     The elimination of the effects of the other tides may be improved by

choosing the period for analysis not exactly equal to one year. For sup-

pose that the expression for the height of water is

+ +A, cos «ii Bi sin n^t Ao cos Woi-I-Ba sin n.2t . , . (61)

where v.2 is nearly equal to n^, and that we wish to eliminate the M2-tide,

so as to be left only with the 7ii-tide.

     Now, this expression is equal to

  -- --{A, f-A, cos (?i,-- rej)^ B., sin O'l «.>)<] cos iiii)  ,^^.
-- + --4- {B,+A2 sin (»! 5(.o)^ Bo cos (»i "2)'') sin n^fi

That is to say, we may regard the tide as oscillating with a speed Hj, but

with slowly-varying range. Now we want to find the mean semi-ranges

Ai, Bi of such an o-scillation, and these will be found if we take the

--average semi-ranges estimated over a good many periods 27r/(ni Wo).

It will be best to stop exactly at the termination of such a period, so that

the number of positive errors may be as nearly as possible equal to the
number of negative ones.

     It is of course impossible to choose for each tide iiy a period which
shall minimise the effects of more than one of the tides of short period

     If »i| be a diurnal tide and n^ a semi-diurnal one, it does not seem
worth while to choose any particular pei'iod for the averaging process,
because the coefficients will go through so large a number of oscillations

the M,-tide is, however, so small that it appears to the writer that there

"We may here remark that there does not seem to be any advantage in

the choice of 369'' o^ as the period, excepting in the analysis for the

M-series and S-series. At the same time there is no harm in that choice,
and therefore the computation forms may be used as they exist. The

choice of a special period for the diurnal tides J and Q also appears to be
useless, and therefore they may be safely used for the period of 370"^ 5**

based on erroneous arithmetic. It may perhaps be worth while to cut off

Nthe last entry in the L and forms, and thus bring the period to its

correct value.

Let ur now return to our general notation, and consider the 24 mean

Wevalues, eacu pertaining to the 24 T-hours.                                                      suppose that all the tides

excepting the 2-tide are adequately eliminated, and, in fact, a computation

of the necessary corrections for tlie absence of complete elimination, which

is given in the Tidal Report of 1872, shows that this is the case.

It is obvious that any one of the 24 values does not give the true

height of the T-tide at that T-hour, but gives the average height of the

water, as due to the T-tide, estimated over half a T-hour before and half

Wea T-hourafter that hour.      must now consider the correction necessary

on this account.

Suppose we have a function

is derivable from h by substituting for the h, corresponding to any value

     Thus when harmonic analysis is applied to the 24 T-honrly values,
the coefEcients which express that oscillation which goes through its

period r times in the 24 T-hours must be augmented by the factor
^ra /sin -gro. Thus we get the following expressions for the augmenting

factors for the diurnal, semi-diurnal, ter-diurnal oscillations, &c., viz. :

     In the reduction of the S-series of tides, the numbers treated are the
actual heights of the water exactly at the S-hours, and therefore no aug-
menting factor is requisite.

   We must now explain how the harmonic analysis, which the use of

these factors presupposes, is carried out.

     If t denotes T-time expressed in houi-s, and n is 15°, we express the
height h, as given by the averaging process above explained, by the

formula

+ + +7t:=Ao Ai cos ni + Bi sin nt X.^ coa 2nt 'B., sin '2nt+ ....

where f is 0, 1, 2 ... . 23.

     Then if S denotes summation of the series of 24 terms found by attri-
buting to t its 24 values, it is obvious that

= = = =' A<,
oV-^' ; Ai=yV-^'' cos nt ; Bi yV2/i sin nt

             A.,     B2-i.T~Jt cos '2nt ;  ^\^Ji  sin 2ut                                  &c.,  &c.
                                                                                        ;

Since ii is 15° and t is an integer, it follows that all the cosines and

sines involved in these sei-ies ai'e equal to one of the following : viz.
± ± ± ± ±0, sin 15°,
             sin 30°,         sin 45°,  sin 60",  sin 75°, ±1. It is

found convenient to denote these sines, as 0, +8^, ±8-2, ±8^, ^8^, ±8r,,
+ 1. The multiplication of the 24 h's. by the various S's, and the sub-

sequent additions may be arranged in a very neat tabular form.

   We append the form for the reduction of the M-tides, filled in for

Karachi 1880-81, but abridged by the omission of some of the decimals.

MThe columns marked ai-e the multipliers appropriate for each series.

The columns I. and II. contain the 24 hourly values to be submitted

to analysis. The subsequent operations are sufficiently indicated by the head-

ings to the columns, and it will be found on examination that the results

Weare in reality the sums of the several series indicated above.                                 believe

that this mode of arranging the harmonic analysis is due to Archibald

Smith, who gives it in the Admiralty manual on the Compass. The

arrangement seems to be very nearly the same as that adopted by Everett

(Trans. Boy. 8oc. Edinb. 1860) in his reductions of observations on under-

ground temperature.

In most cases it is not necessary to deduce moi'e than the tide of the

speed indicated by astronomical theory, but we give the full form by

which the over-tides are deducible. If we want only a diurnal tide, thee

the only columns necessary ai'e I. to VII. add IX. and X. ; if only a semi-

diurnal tide, the columns to be retained are I., IT., III., XII., XIII., XV.,

XVI., XVII.

it will be seen, however, that for these tides there is no augmenting
factor, and that the increase of n for 11^ hours has to be added to C-

         § 10. On the Harmonic Analysis for the Tides of Long Period.

     For the purpose of determining these tides we have to eliminate the
oscillations of water-level arising from the tides of short period. As the
quickest of these tides has a period of many days, the height of mean
water at one instant for each day gives sufficient data. Thus there will

in a year's observations be 365 heights to be submitted to harmonic
analysis. In leap-years the last day's observation must be dropped,
because the treatment is adapted for analysing 365 values.

     To find the daily mean for any day it has hitherto been usual to take
the arithmetic mean of 24 consecutive hourly values, beginning with the

height at noon. This height will then apply to the middle instant of

Wethe period from 0^ to 23^: that is to say, to lli» 30TM at night.

shall propose some new modes of treating the observations, and in the
first of them it will probably be more convenient that the mean for the

day should apply to midnight instead of to ll^ 30TM, For finding a
mean applicable to midnight we take the 25 consecutive heights for O** to
24'', and add the half of the first value to the 23 intermediate and to the
half of the last and divide by 24. It would probably be sufficiently

deal of unnecessary labour has been incurred, and when a simpler plan is
followed it may perhaps be worth while to include more of the short-

period tides in the clearances.

Professor J. C. Adams suggests the use of the tide-predicting machine

for the evaluation of the sura of the clearances, and if this plan is not

found to inconveniently delay operations in India, it may perhaps be

tried.'

In explaining the process we will suppose that method (i) has been

followed                                         if either of the other plans be adopted it will be easy to change
                                              ;

the formulae accordingly.

R +It is clear that cos (a llAw) is the height of the tide ?i at llh 30TM

and the same is true for each such tide. Heuce if we use the tide-

predicter to run oflP a year of fictitious tides with the semi-range of each

tide equal to -J^ sin 12H/sin hi of its true semi-range, and with all the
solar series and the annual and semi-annual tides put at zero, the height

given at each ll'' 30TM in the year is the sum for each day of all the clear-
ances to be subtracted. The scale to which the ranges are set may of

course be chosen so as to give the clearances to a high degree of accuracy.
     In the other process of clearance, which will be explained below, a

single correction for each short-period tide is applied to each of the final

equations, instead of to each daily mean.

   We next take the 365 daily means, and find their mean value. This

gives the mean height of water for the year. If the daily means be un-

cleared, the result cannot be sensibly vitiated.

   We next subtract the mean height from each of the 365 values, and

find 365 quantities c h giving the daily height of water above the mean

height.

     These quantities are to be the subject of the harmonic analysis ; and

the tides chosen for evaluation are those which have been denoted above

as Mm, Mf, MSf, Sa, Ssa.

     If the daily means have been cleared by the use of the tide-predicter as
above described, these ten equations are to be solved by successive
approximation, and we are then furnished with the two component semi-
amplitudes, say Ai, B, of the five long-period tides. But the initial
instant of time is the first 11** 30TM in the year instead of the first noon.

Hence if as before we put R^^Ai^ + Bi'^, and tan 4i=Bi/Ai, we must, in

order to reduce the results to the normal form in which noon of the first day
is the initial instant of time, add to 4fi the increment of the corresponding
argument for 11^ 30TM, according to method (i), or for 12 hours accord-
ing to methods (ii) or (iii).

     If, however, the daily means have not been cleared, then before solu-
tion of the final equations corrections for clearance will have to be applied,
which we shall now proceed to evaluate.

    For this process we still suppose method (i) to be adopted.

     Let n be the speed of a short-period tide in degrees per m. s. hour,

--and let \p («)=^--; - . Then we have already seen that the clearance

to S^,-, the mean height of water at 11'^ 30"" of the (;'-l-l)*^ day, will be

                                -;//(«)R cos lu{24<i+lU} -4'].

   mIf we write m=24?i (so that is the daily increase of argument of the
--tide of short period), and/3:=n x 11-| 4, this becomes

                            -- +(//(m)II cos (mi l3).

     Hence the clearance for c h^ cos li is

             --^\P(n)'R{cos l(m+iyi+ft] + cos [(m - !){ + p]}

and for c 7t,- sin li is

            -- + +lv|.(n)R[sin \_(in J)i 13] -sin [(m-Z);+/3]}.

    Summing the series of 365 terms we find that the additive clearance

for 20 h cos li is

 +-'RxP(n){<p(m l) cos [I82(m+l)+i3'] + <f>(m-l) cos [I82(m-1)+ij]},

where as before

                 ,^(.,)=isi»n_^3ffiL; ^                          (09)

    AnJf denotes the increase of the argument nt in 182"^ ll** 30TM, this

may now be written

   +-Rxj,(n){ff>(m l) cos [An + 182l-Q + cl>{m-l) cos [An - 1821 -Q],

R ARIf therefore cos 4= A, sin 4=B, so that and B are the component

semi-ranges of the tide n as immediately deduced from the harmonic

analysis for the tides of short period, we have for the clearance to

SS h cos li

+-[xP(n)(t>(m+l) cos (^u+182l) ^P(7l)^p(m-l) cos (.ln-182Z)]A

108 REPOiiT-- 1883.
    In precisely the same manner we find the clearance for ^.ch sin U to be

    The functions K(h, /), Z(/;, /), C(//), S(h) may be easily computed

from (70), (71), (72).

    Then if we denote the additive clearance for 2t /t cos U by

               +[A, n, I, cos]A [B, «, I, cos]B,

and that for ^hh sin li by

                               [A, n, I, sin]A+[B, ?i, 1, sin]B.

We have

[B, n, I, sin]= C{H)Z(n, I) cos l82l-S(n)K(n, 1) sin 182Z

   We must remark that if ^(m + l)=o60°, fim + l) is equal to 182-5.

    mThis case arises when I is the tide MSf of speed 2(o--- »>), and the
tide Mj of speed 2(y-<7), for m + l is then 24x 2(y--r;)=720°.

     The clearance of the long-period tide I from the effects of the short-

period tide n requires the computation of these four coefficients. For

the clearance of the five long-period tides from the effects of the three tides
M2, N, O, it will be necessary to compute 60 coefficients.

     If it shall be found convenient to make the initial instant or epoch for

the tides of long period different from that chosen in the reductions of

those of short period, it will, of course, be necessary to compute the

values which A and B would have had if the two epochs had been

Aidentical.  and B are, of course, the component semi-ranges of the tide

of short period at the epoch chosen for the tides of long period ; to

Rdetermine them it is necessary to multiply by the cosine and sine of

V+n--K at the epoch.

    It may happen from time to time that the tide-gauge breaks down for

a few days, from the stoppage of the clock, the choking of the tube, or
aorae other such accident. In this case there will be a hiatus in the

values of S7i. Now, the whole process employed depends on the

existence of 365 continuous values of ch. Unless, therefore, the year's
observations are to be sacrificed, this hiatus must be filled. If not more
tliiin three or four days' observations are wanting, it will be best to plot
out the values of ? h graphically on ench side of the hiatus, and filling
in the gap with a curve drawn by hand, use the values of ch given by the
110 REPOKT--1883.

conjectural curve. If the gap is somewhat longer, several plans may be

suggested, and judgment must be used as to vvhicli of them is to be

adopted.

      If there is another station of observation in the neighbourhood, the

values of ch for that station may be inserted.

     The values of o h for another part of the year, in which tbe moon's

and sun's declinations are as nearly as may be the same as they were
during the gap, may be used.

    It may be, however, that the hiatus is of considerable length, so that
the preceding methods are inapplicable : as when in 1882 the tidal record
for Vizagapatam is wanting for 67 days. The following method of treat-

ment will then be applicable :

   We find approximate values of tbe tidal constituents of long period,

and fill in the hiatus, so as to complete the 365 values, with the com-

puted height of the tide during the hiatus.

To find these approximate values we form ^Ih cos It and Sc/isinZi

for the days of  observation                                                      next, in  the ten final equations of  Schedule
                                                                               ;

P we neglect all the terms with small coefficients, and in the terms whose

coefiBcients are approximately 182"5, we substitute a coefficient equal to

IS'i'o diminished by half the number of days of hiatus. For example,

=for Vizagapatam in 1882 we have 182'5-- -^x 67 149, and, e.g.,
-- = A2c /t cos (tr «r) i 149 approximately. After the approximate values

of A, B, C, D, &c., have been found, it is easy to find the approximate

height of tide for the days of the hiatus. This plan will also apply where

the hiatus is of short duration.

It may be pursued whether or not we are working with cleared

daily means ; for if the daily means are uncleared, as will hence-
forth be the case, we import with the numbers by which the hiatus is

filled exactly those fictitious tides of long period which are cleared away

by the use of the " clearance coefficients," in preparing the ten final

equations for solution.

Other methods of treating a stoppage of the record may be devised.

If the stoppage be near the beginning of the year, or near the end, we
may ueglect the observations before or after the gap, and compute afresh

the 100 coefficients of Schedule P, and the clearance coefficients of

Schedule Q for the number of days remaining. If the gap is in the
middle we might compute the values of the coefficients of Schedules P

and Q as though the days of hiatus were days of observation, bearing

in mind that the formuliB are to be altered by the consideration that time
is to be measured from the initial 11** 30TM of the year, instead of from
the initial lli^ 30TM of the days of hiatus.

     The so computed coefficients are then to be subtracted from the

values given in Schedules P and Q, and the amended final equations and

amended clearance coefficients to be used.

It must remain a matter of judgment as to which of these various

methods is to be adopted in each case.

§ 11. Method of Equivalent Multipliers for the Harmonic Analysis for the
                                        Tides of Long Period.

Up to the present time the harmonic analysis for these tides has been

conducted on a plan which seems to involve a great deal of unnecessary
labour. If I be the speed of any one of the five tides for which the
         HARMONIC ANALYSIS OF TIDAL OBSERVATIONS.                                                Ill

analysis has been carried out, in degrees per m. s. day, the values of cos It
and sin It have been computed for i=0, 1, 2 . . . 364, so that there are

730 values for each of the five tides. These 730 values have then been
multiplied by the 305 cli's corresponding to each value of <, and the
summations gave 'Zcli cos U and 2 c/i sin It, the numerical results being

the left-hand sides of one pair of the ten final equations explained in

§ 10. Now, it appears that this labour may be largely abridged, without

any substantial loss of accnraey.

The plan proposed by Professor Adams is that of equivalent multi-

pliers. The values of cos U may be divided into eleven groups, according

7as they fall nearest tol'O, -9, -8,  ... . -2, "1, 0. Then, as all the values

of ch are to be multiplied by some value of cos It, and that value of cos It

must fall into one of these groups, we collect together all the values of

c li which belong tc one of these groups, sum them, and multiply the sum

by the corresponding multiplier, I'O, "9, -8, &c., as the case may be.

Since there are as many values of cos It which are negative as positive,

we must change the sign of half of the c h's. This changing of sign may

be effected mechanically as follows :--In the spaces for entry of the ch's,

those 2 ^'s whose sign is to be unchanged are to be entered on the left side

of the space if positive, and to the right if  negative                                          when the sign is to
                                                                                              ;

be altered this order of entry is to be reversed. Thus in the column

corresponding to each multiplier we shall have two sub-columns, on the

left all the c h's which, when the signs are appropriately altered, are -f
and on the right those which are -. The sub-columns are to be
separately summed, and their difference gives the total of the column,

which is to be multiplied by the multiplier appropriate to the column.
The treatment for the formation of 28/; sin It is precisely similar.

    The annexed form [Schedule R] is designed for entry for deter-

--mination of I.C h cos (a T])t.

The entries of ih are to be made continuously in the marked squares

from left to right, and back again from right to left. The numbers in

the squares, which in the computation forms are to be printed small and

put in the corner, indicate the days of observation. The rows are

arranged in sets of four corresponding to each complete period of 2(<T--r]).

In the middle pair for each period the -|- values of Sh are to be written

on the right, and in the rest on the left. The word ' change ' opposite

half the rows is to show the computer that he is to change the mode of

entvy. Each column, excepting that for zero, is to be summed at the

Atoot of the page, and multiplied by ihe multiplier corresponding to its
column.  pair of forms is required for each tide of long period; they

are very easily prepared from the existing forms, in which the values of
the multipliers are already computed.

118 EEPORT-- 1883.

Report of the Gommittee, consisting of Mr. Egbert H. Scott
   {Secretary), Mr. J. Norman Lockyer, Professor Gr. Gr. Stokes,
   Professor Balfour Stewart, and Mr. Gr. J. Symons, appointed

   for the purpose of co-operating with the Meteorological Society
   of the Mauritius in their proposed publication of Daily Synoptic

   Charts of the Indian Ocean from the year 1861.

The Committee, appointed at the York meeting in 1881, and reappointed
at Southampton in 1882, have to report that, in his latest letter from the
Mauritius, dated June 21, 1883, Dr. Meldrum informs them that, ' owing
to an increase of routine work, the synoptic charts have not made much
progress since March. However, one month's charts are in the hands of
Messrs. A. and K. Johnston, and others will be so soon. The isobars
have entailed much labour, and they have not yet been finished.

     ' If we cannot present any of the charts to the British Association at

its next meeting, we cannot help it. For my own part I have worked

hard, but I am short of assistance.'

     Under these circumstances the Committee have not thought them-
selves justified in applying for any portion of the grant of 501. placed at
their disposal by the General Committee, inasmuch as none of the charts

have as yet appeared.
     They would, however, request reappointment, with a second renewal

of the gi'ant, inasmuch as the work is actually in an advanced stage of

preparation.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Cayley, Professor
   Gr. Gr. Stokes, Sir William Thomson, Mr. James GtLaisher, a7id

   Mr. J. W. L. G-laisher, on Mathematical Tables.

In the Ueport for 1881 it was stated that the Factor Table for the sixth

Million had been completed and stereotyped. The Introduction to this

Million, which relates to enumerations and comparisons extending over

the whole nine millions, was completed during the present year, and the

volume has been published by Messrs. Taylor and Francis. The gap of

three millions between the third million and the seventh million, is there-

fore now filled in, and the tables extend from unity to 9,000,000. The

--dates of publication of the nine millions are second, 1814; third, 1816;

,

I first, 181-7; seventh, 1862; eighth, 1863; ninth, 1865; fourth, 1879;

fifth,  1880                          sixth,  1883.
                                   ;

The results of the enumeration of the primes in the sixth million

were given in the Report for 1881.

The Introduction to the Sixth Million, which occupies 103 pages, con-

tains a detailed account of the enumeration of the primes in the first nine

millions, with a comparison of the results with the values given by

Legendre's, Tchebychefi''s, and Riemann's formulae.

The number of primes is given in each successive group of 1000

numbers from unity up to 9,000,000, and there are also similar tables for

groups  of                            10,000                                  100,000 ;  250,000, and  500,000.  The enumeration
                                                                           ;

according to centuries is also given in a series of ninety tables, showing

the numbers of centuries which contain no prime, one prime, two primes,

three primes, &c., in each group of 10,000 numbers ; and there are similar
             fc)N MATHEMATICAL TABLES.  119

tables for groups of 100,000 and for the complete millions. There are

also tables giving sequences of 100 or more consecutive composite num-

bers in the nine millions.

    A short account of the results of this enumeration was given in th.e

Eeport for 1881 (pp. 305-308), and ib is perhaps worth while to supple-
ment that account by giving the following list of sequences exceeding
130 in the whole nine millions, arranged in the order of their length.

                                                                       to 9,000,000.

at intervals of 50,000 ujd to 9,000,000. The comparisons are also given
for the separate groups of 50,000. The deviations are given in separate

tables.

     Table I., which is abridged from the more extended tables given in
the Introduction, shows the numbers of primes counted and the numbers
given by the formulae (i.), (ii.), (iii.), at intervals of 100,000 up to
9,000,000. Table II. shows the deviations in the case of the three

formulae.

actually counting them, so that his numbers should be exact. Hargreave,

also, in the ' Philosophical Magazine ' for 1854, had obtained by means of

a similar process the number of primes inferior to 10,000,000. In the

case of 10,000,000 Meissel's number is 664,580, and Hargreave's

664,633 ; for 100,000,000 Meissel's number is 5,761,461. Meissel is so

accurate a calculator that his results are entitled to be accepted with

confideiice                                                 and, taking  his  numbers to represent the actual numbers of

is not much difference between them for values of x near 9,000,000.

by Legendre's formula.

   A portion of the Introduction relates to the calculation of the loga-

rithm integral li x, which occurs both in Tchebycheff's and in Riemann's

formulfe. The methods of calculation adopted are explained, and certain

values of the function Ei (x) are given, and also some corrections to

Bessel's values of li x.

The convergence of Riemann's formula is very slow, and the con-

cluding sections of the Introduction are devoted to a discussion of the

magnitudes of the successive terms.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Crum Bkowh
   {Secretary), and Messrs. Milne-Home, John Murray, and

   BucHAN, appointed for the purpose of co-operating with the
   Scottish Meteorological Society in making Meteorological Obser-

   vations on Ben Nevis.

A GKANT of 50Z. was made to the Committee by the British Association

in 1882 ' for the purpose of co-operating with the Scottish Meteorological

Society in making Meteorological Observations on Ben Nevis.'
     These observations were on a much more extensive scale than those

of the summer of 1881. In 1882 six additional stations were established
at different altitudes between the two principal stations on the top of Ben

Nevis and at Fort William. These stations were so placed that observa-
tions could be made at regular intervals of half an hour during the ascent
and descent ; and simultaneously with these, half-hourly observations
were made at Fort William. The number of observations made daily at
Fort William was twenty- one, and on the top of Ben Nevis five, the latter
being from 9 to 11 a.m.

      In addition to the usual instrumental observations, special attention

was given to noting wind, cloud, and other weather changes, and it may
be added that these eye observations were carried out by Mr. Wragge

with an ability and an enthusiasm worthy of the highest praise.
     Owing to the excessive labour in copying these elaborate and volu-

minous observations from the note-books, the observations only began to
be received at the Society's office in June and thereafter from time to

time in July and August. On this account little more than a beginning
has been made with their discussion.

     From the half-hourly observations beginning with 5 A.M., the diurnal
--126 REPORT 1883.

curves for atmosplieric pressure, temperature, and humidity have been

calculated for Port William. These curves are interesting and valuable

as showing the eminently insular character of the climate of the region
round the base of Ben Nevis from which the air is drawn which ascends
its slopes on a summer's day. The curves of pressure, temperature, and

humidity for the top of Ben Nevis from 9 to 11 a.m. are also highly
interesting and important, especially when compared with the curves for

these hours at Fort William. The degree of saturation of the atmo-
sphere and its persistency on the top of Ben Nevis during these hours of

the day is perhaps the most important meteorological feature of the

climate of this elevated region : and this feature is all the more pro-

nounced when a cyclone is advancing from the Atlantic.

This type of weather prevailed, with few and short-continued inter-

ruptions during the whole season of 1881. But in 1882, isolated periods

of fine weather and well-marked anticyclones occurred in Scotland, when
the atmosphere at the top of Ben Nevis passed from a state of saturation to

--a state of extreme dryness a dryness indeed greater than could be found

anywhere nearer than the region of the Sahara. These violent contrasts

are often separated from each other by exceedingly short intervals of time

and of space. It is to be noted that the extremest cases of dryness have

only been observed at the very top of the mountain and were in every

case accompanied by a very high temperature for that height. This

peculiarity marks the Ben Nevis Observatory as admirably suited for the

prosecution of some hygrometric and other physical inquiries which are

so urgently called for in the present state of meteorology.

It is expected that the discussion of these observations will be com-

pleted by Mr. Buchan, and the results published, in the ' Journal of the

AScottish Meteorological Society,' early next year.  copy of the ' Jour-

nal ' will be sent to the British Association.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Schuster (Secre-
   tary), Sir William Thomson, Professor H. E. EoscoE, Professor

   A. S. Herschel, Captain W. de W. Abney, Mr. E. H. Scott,
   Dr. J. H. Gladstone, and Mr. J. B. N. Hennessey, appointed

   for the purpose of investigating the practicability of collecting

   and identifying Meteoric Dust, and of considering the question

   of imdertaking regular observations in various localities.

The work of the Committee during the past time consisted chiefly in the
examination of some solid residues of Himalayan ice. The ice was boiled
down according to instructions of one of the members of the Committee
(Mr. J. B. N. Hennessey) by a surveying party, who forwarded to the
Secretary three specimens. One of these came from the Gamukdori

Pass, on the watershed between the Indus and the Kishenganga (lat. 35° 5',
long. 74° 13'), at an altitude of 13,400 feet; and two from the Shokari

Pass (lat. 35° 0', long. 74° 38', altitude 14,700 feet). There is no human
habitation near either of these places. The amount of snow boiled down

was about 25 cubic feet, and the solid residue was about the same in all
three cases, weighing a little over "1 gramme. It consisted chiefly of
organic matter, due principally to birds, but a quantity of magnetic
particles was also found in them. The magnetic matter in great part is
due to ferruginous rocks, and must have been brought by the wind to the

place where it was found ; but all the specimens also contained (1) spherical
particles of magnetic oxide of iron, and (2) small particles of iron, partly
metallic, of the shape given in last year's Report. These are probably of
a meteoric origin. The Committee is still pursuing the work for which
it was appointed.

Report of the Oominittee, consisting of Captain Abney (Secretary),

   Professor W. Gr. Adams, Professor Gr. C. Foster, Lord Eayleigh,

   Mr. Preece, Professor Schuster, Professor Dewar, Mr. Vernon
   Harcourt, and Professor Ayrton, reappointed for the piirpose
   of fixing a Standard of White Light.

The Committee have received the draft of a report from their Secretary.
As the subject has recently received much attention from different sides,
and as the Committee hope to increase the value of their report by an
extension and further discussion of the experiments, they prefer to defer
the publication of their full report until next year. To carry out the
intention of the Committee a grant of 201. will be required.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professors Williamson,

   Frankland, Roscoe, Crum Brown, a^id Odling, a7id Messrs. J.

   ]\IiLLAR Thomson, V. H. Veley, and H. B. Dixon {Secretary),

   appointed for the purpose of drawing up a statement of the
   varieties of Chemical Names which have come into use, for in-
   dicating the causes xchich have led to their adoption, and for
   considering what can he done to bring about some convergence
   of the views on Chemical Nomenclature obtaining among Eng-
   lish and foreign chemists.

The Committee have been as yet unable to complete their report on

AChemical Nomenclature.  large part of the work of drawing up in

tabular form the varieties of chemical names which have come into

general use in England and abroad has been accomplished, but the Com-

mittee wish to extend the work before making their report, and for this

purpose desire to be reappointed for another year, with the addition of

the names of Mr. Japp, Professor Dewar, Mr. Vernon Harcourt, and Mr.

Forster Morley.

Report of the Com,mittee, consisting of Professors Odling,

   Huntington, and Hartley (Secretary), appointed for the
   purpose of investigating by means of Photography the Ultra-
   violet Spark Spectra emitted by Metallic Elements, and their

   combinations under varying conditions. Drawn up by Pro-
   fessor W. N. Hartley.

--The disappearance of sJiort lines. It was shown in a former Report of this

Committee (Southampton Meeting) that the spectra of metallic solutions
were the same as those from metallic electrodes line for line, in most
cases even short and weak lines being reproduced. The principal differ-

ence observable in the two spectra was a lengthening of the short lines
128 EEPOET-- 1883.

when spectra were taken from solutions, so that discontinuous lines

became long or continuous lines.

   A few instances of short lines disappeai^ing have also been noticed,

but such disappearances occur only when the lines are so short, mere dots

in fact, that no solution can contain a quantity of the metal sufficient to

yield an image of them, unless the rest of the spectrum be greatly over-

exposed. Certain very short lines in the spectrum of zinc are an example

of this. Very short lines in the spectrum of aluminium were not repro-

duced by solutions of the chloride unless the solutions were highly con-

centrated. It may thus be seen that the quantity of metal present in the

--compound thus determines the presence of the lines.
     The lengthening of short lines. It was remarked that in certain cases
metallic electrodes showed a different spectrum according to whether the

spark was passed between dry or wet electrodes. Thus it was pointed

out that when iridium electrodes are moistened with calcium chloride,

discontinuous lines which are very numerous in this spectrum became

continuous, and on further examination into this matter it has been found

that even moistening with water has the same effect. Hence the supposi-

tion, of which there seemed some possibility but no proof, that a chloride

of the metal was formed was found to be untenable. The very short lines in

the spectrum of zinc were lengthened by the action of water upon the elec-

trodes. It has now been proved beyond doubt that this peculiar varia-

tion in the spectra is caused by the cooling action of the water upon the

    Alterations in the spectrum of carbon. As already stated in the previous

Report, graphite electrodes have been generally employed for the purpose

Aof producing spark specti-a from solutions.  portion of the work in

connection with this subject included an investigation of the effect of

water and of saline solutions in varying the spectrum of carbon. It will

of course be readily seen that, as carbon is capable of combining with
oxygen and nitrogen, different spectra might be obtained by making

one or other of those gases the atmosphere surrounding the electrodes,

but it is not so easy to explain why graphite points should give two dif-
ferent spectra in air when dry and a third spectrum when moistened

with water, the same spark conditions being maintained. Three such
spectra have been photographed, but without the aid of maps their

peculiarities are not capable of exact description. The maps which were

drawn were presented to the Royal Society together with a communi-

cation on this subject, three months since, so that they are not at present

available. It may be said, however, that the difference between the

spectra taken from dry electrodes in air consists in the omission of a

certain number of the less refrangible lines, which have undoubtedly

been identified with carbon.                             long series of expe-

riments has been made with the object of determining the non-ruetallic

elements which are capable of yielding spark spectra when in combina-

tion with the metals. Chlorides, bromides, iodides, sulphides, nitrates,

sulphates, selenates, phosphates, carbonates, and cyanides yield nothing.

On the other hand, solutions in hydrochloric acid of arsenites, arseniates,

and antimoniates yield spectra of arsenic and antimony respectively.

Borates and silicates in solution yield very characteristic spectra of the

non-metallic constituents ; but if the solutions be prepared from sodium

salts, the lines of the metal do not appear in the case of borates, and only

the strongest line of sodium (,\=3301) can be observed in the spectrum

of silicates, even when concentrated solutions are used. These are the first

--spectra of boron and silicon obtained from metallic salts. Their lines are

the following :

    In Messrs. Liveing and Dewar's map of the carbon spectrum,' and in
the list of the carbon lines, and in the map of the iron spectrum,^ a
number of lines are given which are absent from the photographs of the

spectrum of graphite published in the Transactions of the Royal Dublin

and in the Journal of the Chemical Society.^ Many hundreds of spectra

taken between graphite poles have failed to show a trace of these lines,
and as the spectra have been photographed under varying conditions it is
scarcely likely that the lines in question are really carbon lines. They
have now been identified with the spectrum of silicon. The following

are their wave-lengths :

beryllium and scandium, must be as close as that between scandium and

yttrium. Now Thalen's spectra of scandium and yttrium, though, both

totally unlike the spectrum of any other element, have many characters in

common ; ' both spectra contain highly characteristic groups of lines in

the orange and yellow regions, the lines or bands degrading towards the

red, and the number of lines which have been measured are no fewer
than 103 and 90 respectively. From these two spectra, that of beryllium

is entirely different, as well in the character and grouping as in the
number of the lines. Of the remaining rare earth-mctals at present known,

cerium is a tetrad, didymium is a pentad, and lanthanum a triad ; their

spectra are quite dissimilar from that of beryllium. In consideration of

these facts it is impossible to classify the spectrum of beryllium along

with the spectra of the rare earth metals of the triad group.

    Let us now consider the question of the dyad groups. On the assump-

tion that beryllium has an atomic weight of 9'2, there is no difficulty

in placing it at the head of the second series of elements in which position

--it stands in the same relation to the sub-groups magnesium, zinc,

--cadmium, and calcium, strontium, barium that lithium occupies with re-

gard to sodium, potassium, rubidium and copper, silver, mercury.

Its position is also similar to that of boron and of carbon in relation

to the triad and tetrad- metals. The spectra belonging to magnesium,
-- Azinc, cadmium, have a very definite constitution ; they consist of 1.

Asingle line ; 2.  pair of  lines                                                                                          3.  Three  to  four  groups  of  triplets ;  4.

between the individual lines in the diflerent groupings increases with the

increase in the atomic weights of the elements. In fact these spectra

present a considerable addition to the body of evidence in support of the

view that elements whose atomic weights differ by an approximately

constant quantity, and whose chemical properties are similar, are truly

homologous bodies, or in other words ai'e the same kind of matter in

different states of condensation. Their particles are vibrating in the

same manner, but with different velocities.

In the spectra of the metals calcium, strontium, and barium, succes-

sive pairs of lines are a strong feature, in addition to which there are

some other groups in the spectrum of barium. The individuals of each

pair are separated by smaller intervals the more refrangible the lines and

by longer intervals the higher the atomic weights. It cannot be said

that the spectrum of beryllium is similar in constitution to either of

these groups of elements, which it should be if it stt'ictly belonged

to one of them. There is some slight resemblance in character to the

spectrum typical of the calcium group, beryllium having two pairs of

lines, the individuals of the first or less refrangible pair being separated

by a greater interval than those of the second pair. It is a spectrum

analogous to that of lithium, having but few lines and no striking re-

semblance to the elements which follow in the series because it stands at>
the head of two sub-groups. Hence it has been concluded that beryl-

lium is the first member of a dyad series to which probably calcium,
strontium, and barium are more strictly homologous than magnesium,

zinc, and cadmium. It is to be understood that this is a conclusion
drawn from one view only, and is open to correction or modification

when fresli facts sliall have been discovered, bub so far, the views of
Professor Emerson Reynolds and Dr. Brauner are maintained by these
spectrum observations, for beryllium is shown to be quite out of place
among the triad elements, including those belonging to the rare earths.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professors "W. A. Tildex

   and H. E. Armstrong {Secretary), appointed for the purpose

    of investigating Isomeric Naphthalene Derivatives.

Since the appointment of the Committee, the investigation has been

-- Aprosecuted mainly in three directions : 1. careful study has been made

of Betanaphthol and especially of the sulphonic acids derived therefrom
and peculiarities have come to light which confirm the view that the

behaviour of Betanaphthol is in many respects different from that of the
phenols which have hitherto been investigated. 2. The isomeric naphtha-
lenedisulphonic acids have been farther examined and much has been

done towards establishing the nature of the conditions under which they
are formed. 3. The isomeric naphthalenedisulphonic acids have been
converted into corresponding Dichloronaphthaleues and Dihydrosynaph-
thalenes and the comparative study of the latter has been commenced.

      As, however, it is not desired to describe individual compounds, but to
study comparatively the behaviour of several members of certain classes

of isomeric naphthalene derivatives, and as much remains to be done be-

fore a connected account can be given of the results of the investigation,
the Committee consider it desirable to postjDone their report until next
year, when, it is hoped, it will be possible to carry out their intention

and therefore ask to be reappointed. The grant placed at their disposal
has been entirely expended in the purchase of material.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Valentine Ball,

   Professor W. Boyd Dawkins, Dr. J. Evans, Mr. Gr. H. Kinahan,
   and Mr. Eichard J. Ussher (Secretary), appointed for the

    purpose of carrying out Explorations in Caves in the Car-
    boniferous Limestone in the South of Ireland.

 During the past year your Committee have aimed at the exploration of
 Shandon Cave, near Dungarvan, which yielded remains of extinct post-
 Pleiocene mammalia in 1859 and in 1875. The exploration conducted

 in the latter year by the late Professor A. Leith Adams was discontinued

 by him in consequence of the danger presented by the loose impending
 rocks forming the roof, some of which have sunk down upon the ossiferous
 beds. The first step to the exploration has been the removal of this
 dangerous roof, which tended to fall away in shelves.

      During the latter part of 1882 circumstances rendered it unadvisable
 to move in the matter of Shandon Cav^e; but in January last your
 Committee entered into an arrangement with the occupier of the ground
 to quarry away a specified portion of the cliff over the cave's mouth, first
         ON EXPLORATIOJ<S IN CAVES IN CARBONIFEROUS LIMESTONE. 133

removing the fence and the soil above it. Two or more men were kept

almost constantly at this work from February during the spring and
snmmer months, and the large amount of stone quarried has been carted
away. But though little now remains to be done to put the cave into a

fit state for exploration of its ossiferous deposits, it has not been possible

hitherto to commence the latter operation.
     The work done has been inspected by Mr. DufBn, the county sur-

veyor. The Committee have applied 5/. in payment for this, and retain

-- --5?. for current expenses, the balance of the grant namely, 101. remain-

ing undrawn. The Committee beg leave to apply for a fresh grant of
501., to reap the fruits of what has been done and to explore the por-
tions of the cave thereby laid bare. They hope before the next meetino-
of the Association to report upon the examination of the ossiferous beds
that have hitherto been inaccessible without the preliminary work of
removing the roof, and also to explore any other Carboniferous Limestone

caves that they may have an opportunity of examining in Ireland,

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor A. H. Green,

   Professor L. C. ]Miall, ISIr. John Brigg, and IMr. James W.

    Davis (Secretary), a2opointecl to assist in the Exploration of
    Raygill Fissure, Yorkshire.

The fissure occurs in an anticlinal of limestone in Lothersdale, near
Skipton. It was formerly open to the surface, and from thence extended
in a southerly direction, and with only a slight inclination fi-om a vertical
line. During repeated operations of quarrying it has been from time to
time cut across on the face of the qu.arry, each exposure being at a lower
level and exhibiting some new feature in the character of the clays and
sands which have been carried into it. In December 1879 the Council
of the Toi'kshire Geological and Polytechnic Society decided that it was
desirable that steps should be taken to secure a thorough investigation of
the fissure and its contents, and appointed a Committee, consisting of
Professors Green and Miall and of Messrs. Brigg and Davis, to carry out
the exploration. The Committee decided to apply to the members of the
society for subscriptions to enable them to carry on the work, and a fund
of 60?. was obtained, separate from the ordinary income of the society,
and operations at the quarry were commenced in June of the following
year. Mr, Spencer, the proprietor, and Mr. Todd, his manager, placed

men skilled in the class of work required at the disposal of the Committee,
and Mr. Todd kindly undertook the management of the work.' The

fissure opened into the face of the quarry towards the north, the limestone

dipping at a sharp angle into the hill southwards. The opening of
the fissure when the operations were commenced was 27 feet G inches
from top to bottom, and about 9 feet across. It was situated about
60 feet below the surface of the ground, and the same distance above the
floor of the quarry. The section exposed in the opening showed the fol-

lowinog beds :

nearly horizontal ; it is sufficiently open for a man to creep along a

distance of 25 feet, where a mass of fallen limestone prevents further

progress, but beyond this mass an additional distance could be distin-

guished of about 12 or 14 feet. The second branch extends in a southerly

direction, and appears to fall rapidly. It is only accessible for a distance

of 3 or 4 yai'ds. Where the roof and sides of the fissure are exposed

they show signs of erosion ; the surfaces are smoothened and the corners
of the limestone rounded off by running water. There is very little

appearance of stalagmite having been found.

The following section will serve to explain the relative position of

the beds hitherto worked upon. It represents a section across the fissnre

in a north and south direction :

1. Laminated clay.

2. Sand and sandy clay with boulders, without stratification.
3. Brown sandy clay, with rounded stones blackened, and numerous

bones of animals, unstratified (bone-earth).

4. Stiif yellow clay, with large masses of angular limestone.

The stiff yellow clay at the lower part of the excavated portion occupied

a large area in front of the fissure, the bone-earth being behind. Mr. Todd

states that in the uppermost portion of the fissure, near the surface, there

was a considerable amount of similar yellow clay. The excavation was

continued for a short distance into the horizontal branch of the fissure,

proceeding in an easterly direction. The opening is large, and, as stated,

Acontains a quantity of material reaching almost to the roof.  number

of bones and teeth have been found, similar to those obtained from

bone-earth at a higher elevation. In this jDart of the fissure, in addition

to the remains of elephas, hyena, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, bear, the

bones of some smaller animal, probably fox, and the bones of a bird,

there were found teeth of the lion.

The work had now proceeded so far that it was thought desirable

to postpone the operations of your Committee, to enable Mr. Spencer to

quarry the limestone in front of the fissure, and during the jiast year a

great mass of limestone has been removed. Whilst quarrying the lime-

stone above the site of the fissure a branch was found to extend in a south-

westerly direction almost vertically to the surface, forming with the

excavated one a Y-shaped junction. It was filled up with clay and sand,

and a few bones were found. The bones were much decomposed, and

broke into fragments while the attempt was being made to extricate them.
     Your Committee hope that during the coming winter the proprietor of

the quarry, Mr. Spencer, will be able to remove all the limestone which

still impedes the entrance to the fissure and the continuance of the work,

and that the excavation may be resumed during the early part of next

spring.

In conclusipn we cannot too heartily express our indebtedness to

Mr. Spencer and to Mr. Todd for the kind and generous manner in which

they have assisted in the excavation.

Eleventh Report of the Committee, consisting of Professors J.

   Prestwich, W. Boyd Dawkixs, T. McK. Hughes, and T. Gr.
   Bo^·XEy, Dr. H. W. Ckosskey, Dr. Deane, and Messrs. C. E.
   De Raxce, H. Ct. Fordham, J. E. Lee, D. Mackintosh, \Y.
   Pengelly, J. Plant, and E. H. Tiddemax, for the purpose of

    recording the position, height above the sea, lithological charac-

   ters, size, and origin of the Erratic Blocks of England, Wales,
   and Ireland, repjorting other matters of interest connected with
    the same, o.nd taking measures for their preservation. Draion
   up hy Dr. Crosskey, Secretary.

The Committee is able to record many additional facts respecting erratic

blocks, in its report for the present year. The Committee continue to
confine their work to recording the observations made, and do not
attempt to oiFer theoretical explanations. The information collected
will enable the distribution of the erratic blocks to be mapped with con-
siderable accuracy, and it is ultimately intended to tabulate the results

obtained.

     This work, however, must necessarily be delayed in consequence of
the constant discovery of fresh groups of erratic blocks.

     So many new facts are reported to the Committee year by year from

difEerent parts of the country, that it would lead to mistaken generalisa-

tions to make any attempt at complete classification.

   --Yorlcsldre. The Committee have received from Mr. James E. Westby,

of Sheffield, the subjoined report on erratic blocks found at Crosspool :
      Crosspool is about one and a half miles west of Sheffield, on the

rising ground to the left of the Sheffield and Glossop turnpike road, and
lies on shales underlying the Middle Rock (Gannister Series) of the
Lower Coal Measures.

     To the east the ground slopes towards Sheffield ; to the west it begins
to slope to the Rivelin N^alley. To the north-east the Middle Rock
sandstone forms a bold escarpment while the land from Crosspool rises

                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

quickly to the south-west up to Sandygate.
     The heights of the various points above sea-level are : Lydgate,

800 ft. ; River Rivelin, 350 ft. ; Crosspool, 730 ft. ; Sandygate, 850 ft.
     To the west of a line drawn from Sandygate, through Crosspool to

Lydgate, the drainage and fall is towards the River Rivelin, while on
the eastern side of the same line the rainfall is ultimately drained into
the River Porter, both of which streams are tributaries of the River Don.
Lying on the high land forming the outer edge of the drainage area of
the River Porter, on its north side, there is a triangular patch of flat

ground, now very uneven, having been worked for brick-making, over

which lie scattered blocks and boulders of various sizes, which have been

exposed and left in their present position by the workmen, who have

generally got all the available clay.

     In the sections exposed the clay containing these blocks varies from

2 ft. down to 10 and 12 ft. in depth, differing much from the ordinary

surface-clays of the district, which are generally the decomposed coal-
measure shales.
ON THE ERIIAIIC BLOCKS OF ENGLAND, WALES, AND IRELAND. 137

    On tbe local blocks, which vary from lai'ge masses weighing 3 or
4 tons, down to small pebbles, there are irregular scratches, but several

--of the erratics, which are scarce probably constituting but ^^j^oth part of
--the coarser materials have the strias finely and regularly marked alono-

the longer axis of the stone in decided grooves.

There do not appear to be any erratics on the neighbouring highlands,

and the adjoining fields have not been worked so as to reveal sections.

It is probable, however, that a much larger area than the one here

detailed once existed, for a large felstone boulder was found in the Porter

valley, near Ecclesall Road, Sheffield, a distance of 1^ miles S.W.

from Crosspool, and 600 feet lower in level, in composition and appear-

ance identical with several of the Crosspool boulders.

With the exception of the erratics catalogued, the large boulders

consist either of millstone grit or coal-measure sandstones, which arc

local rocks                                                  the millstone grit series  appearing  only ^ mile to  the  west,
                                                          ;

while the grit series crops out in the Rivelin valley.

Petrol ogically, however, many of these boulders differ from the rocks

in the immediate neighbourhood, although they have evidently been

derived from the same measures.

Some of the gannister, e.ij., is compact, fine-grained and nearly white,

but its identity is shown by a new fracture revealing traces of stigmaria.

The following is a list of the principal ei'ratics :

The specimens have been named by Professor Bonney.

Although the size of some of the specimens is much less than that of

those usually catalogued as boulders, yet their peculiarities render the

list of value.

    More specimens of magnesian limestone than ai-e named in this list
have been found, together with numbers of boulders of a red sandstone

differing from any local rock, and like some of the New Red Sandstones

of Lancashire and Cheshire.
        ON THE ERRATIC BLOCKS OF ENGLAND, WALES, AND IRELAND. 139

     The probable sources of three-fourths of the erratics which have been

identified are to the north-west.

     Slate rocks and tuff, from Borrowdale volcanic series of the Lake

districts.

     Carb. limestone and chert, from North Lancashire or North-west

Yorkshire.

    New red sandstone, from North Lancashire.

     Millstone grits and gannister series, from Pennine hills and borders,
across South-west Yorkshire to Crosspool.

     Several of the specimens were probably derived from the east lowlands
of Scotland, while the magnesian limestones are from the north-east of
England.

  --Midland Counties. From Professor T. G. Bonney, M.A., F.R.S., the

Committee lias received the following report :
     Erratic blocks are so rare on or near the northern edge of Cannock

Chase, in the vicinity of the Trent, that the following instances are worth

recording.

     In the immediate neighbourhood of Rugeley I only know of one

erratic ; as a rule one does not hesitate to refer all pebbles to the Bunter
conglomerate, directly or indirectly. That formerly stood in an open

part of a street on the south side of the town, where the name ' Crossley
Stone ' is still a record. Some years since it was broken up, and the
fragments removed to the neighbourhood of a canal wharf on the opposite
side of the town. There are now two fragments, partly buried in the
ground: the larger measures 4 ft. 6 in. x 4 ft., and is at the thickest
part 1 ft. 2 in. ; the other piece is a little smaller. The first two dimen-

sions, as far as I can remember, represent the area of the original stone.
The rock is a compact grey felstone, a typical example of a boulder of the
' Arenig dispersion.'

     In the village of Colton, about one mile from the Trent, and on its
left bank, boulders appear to be more common. Four are used as guards
at the angle of a little bridge near the church ; one is rudely triangular,
each side being about 2 ft. 6 in., and the thickness about 1 ft. 3 in. ; a
second is about 3 ft. x 1 ft. 9 in. x 1 ft. 6 in. ; a third ratlier smaller.
These are a grey granite, like that from Criffel. The fourth boulder is
rather oval, its longest diameter being about 3 ft. This is a moderately
coarse syenite, consisting of pinkish felspar and green hornblende, with a

--little quartz I believe, a Scotch rock ; these, of course, are not in situ,

but cannot have been brought from far. Built into walls, used as steps,
or lying about in or near the village, are several other boulders of smaller
size, commonly not exceeding 1 ft. 6 in. in longest diameter. The grey
granite (CriSel) is the commonest rock ; but I noticed two of the 'Arenig'
felstone, one also of a greenish-grey felspathic grit, some of the (not

--numerous) quartz grains being of a bluish colour probably from Wales

and one (at the crossing of two roads in the village) a minutely crystal-
line syenite or hornblendic granite, reddish felspar being the predominant
mineral. I have seen the rock before in collections of erratics. I believe
it is Scotch, though I think there is a rock something like it in the Carrock
Fell region. It is certainly of northern origin.

     The following boulders in the Midland Counties are recorded on the
authority of Mr. Horace Pearce, of Stoui-bridge :

     Boulder (10 ft. in circumference, 2 ft. x 10 in. in height) in parish of
140 EEPORT-- 1883.

Clent, Worcestersliire, at junction of road from Stourbridge to Broms-
grove, with by-road to Clent Hills. Felbtone. Another block of felstone

is on the opposite side of the road.
     Boulder (11 ft. 7 in. in circumference) just beyond the north-west

corner of Highgate Common, Staffordshire, near a large Spanish chesnut-

tree. Granite.

     Group of boulders near Claverly, Shropshire, and between there and
Bridgnorth, comprising blocks of granite and felsite.

      Boulder (9 ft. 4 iu. in circumference) near Waystone, Abbot's Castle
Hill, in boundary road between Staffordshire and Shropshire. Felsite.

     Boulder (5 ft. in circumference) on boundai'y road near Halfpenny
Green, Salop. Vein quartz.

     Group of boulders near Gospel Ash, Staffordshire, comprising blocks
of hornblendic granite poor in quartz, and said by Professor Bonney to
be indistinguishable from specimens from Buttermere, and compact fel-
site and mica syenite.

   --SJiropsMre. The group of erratic blocks near Clun has been further

examined by Mr. Luff, who reports that he has this year tracked the lai'ge

Plinlimmon boulders lying in the Clun district eastwards from Black
Hill over the Twitcheu valley on to Clunbury Hill, and westwards to
Beguildy, on the Radnorshire side of the Teme, i.e. for a distance of
about 10^ miles. Southwards they dot the country here and there as far
as Llanvair Waterdine, about five miles distant. Smaller fragments lie
in a pretty continuous stream right up to Keriy Hill in Llontgomery-

shire. None have as yet been found north of the Clun valley. Though

they are most plentiful on the top of the ridge of hills south of Clun,
they are by no means confined to high levels.

      The highest boulder is upon Black Hill. It is a grit from Rhayader,
23 miles W.S.W., and has an elevation of something over 1,400 ft.
Standing on Black Hill by this boulder, and looking westwards, the
mountains of Radnorshire and Montgomeryshire are seen rising in trans-
verse ridges across the line of sight, mass above mass in gradual stages,

the hills in the near front being 1,200 to 1,400 ft. high ; the Radnorshire

Beacons, 1,796 ft. ; Rhydd Hywell, 1,919 ft. ; up to the Plinlimmon

range itself, twenty to thirty miles distant.

     At present there appears to be no intermixture on this horizon of
erratics from any other direction but the west. Granite boulders occur
 on the north flank of the Longmynd, i.e. within about sixteen miles. The
hills on the north of Clun, it may be noted, are not so high as those on

 the west. In addition to those recorded in the last report the following

 boulders have been observed :
      'The Fairy Stone,' on the south-west corner of Clunbury Hill, pebble

 grit from the neighbourhood of Rhayader. Size, 3 ft. X 2 ft. 3 in. X

2 ft. 6 in. Exact position, 52° 24' 35" N., 2° 55' 20" W. Subangular.

      Llanvair Hill Boulder, 3 ft. 9 in. x 4 ft. 7 in. and 2 ft. deep. Sub-
 angular. Grit from district as above.

      Burfield Flagstone, about half a mile west of the ' Great Boundary
 Stone ' described last year, and, like it, from near Machynlleth. 7 ft. 9 in.
 long, 6 ft. broad ; deeply buried in the ground, from which one end rises

 2 ft. 6 in.

     The Beguildy ' Stone,' 52° 24' 10" N., 3° 10' 30" W. Height above

-- --ground, 3 ft. 6 in. ; breadth, 4 ft. 3 in. ; thickness very irregular from
        ON THE EKRATIC BLOCKS OF ENGLAND, WALES, AND IRELAND. 141

12 in. to 24 in. Thoroughly rounded at every angle. Many unsuccessful
attempts have been made to remove this stone, for, standing in the midst

of a field, it is an obstruction to agricultural operations. At a depth of
4 ft. it is said to spread out to a much greater thickness. Tt also is a
Llandovery grit, and its parent rock is in the Rhayader district, though
it is commonly believed to have travelled from a diflerent direction for

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

the popular legend says the devil threw it from the Graig Don rocks,
near Knighton, at Beguildy church, and as a proof the marks of his hand
are still pointed out upon it. One of these marks is a bowl-like depression

on its upper surface 12 in. diameter and 5 in. deep.

--Leicestershire.   Mr.  J.  Plant continues                                         his  reports  upon  the  Leicester-
                                                                                  '

shire groups of boulders :

                         A. Isolated Bouldees.

  --Hallaton, near Tlxjpinijlmm, Leicestershire, south-east. On the roadside

at Hare Pie Bank is a large erratic block, 7 ft. X 6 ft. x 3 ft. Fine striae

cover the upper surface. The block is said to have been moved some

twenty yards, from an adjoining field, some fifty years ago. It was found

lying in the upper boulder clay, which is very thick over this district (in

some places over 80 ft. deep), and contains boulders of all sizes, including

very large flints. Many of the boulders are covered with scratches.

Height above the sea between 500 and 550 ft.

     The erratic looks like a calcareous sand.stone of the marlstone rock,

which is found below the drift in the immediate neighbourhood. No

outcrop of this rock occurs in the neighbourhood rearer than Tilton,
some six miles to the north-west.^

     Numbers of erratics, but of smaller dimensions, are found in the

village itself, forming the foundations of old farm-houses, walls, &c.

Many of these are millstone grit, mountain limestone, and sandstone froiQ:

the coal measures.

-- ABoad from Lozighborotigh to Ashbij, Leicestershire.                                                  large erratic,

size 3 ft. X 3 ft. X 2 ft. ; not known to have been moved. It is of mill-

stone grit, and must have come at least thirty miles' distance from the

north. No strife are visible. Height above the sea, about 250 feet.

                                     B. Groups of Boulders.

  --Saxe-Cohurg Street, Leicester. Two more large boulders have been

uncovered here in excavating for the foundations of houses; size, each

about 3 ft. X 2 ft. 6 in. x 1 ft. 10 in. They are of Mount Sorrel granite,
distant about seven miles north. They are rounded and subangular.
No striae seen. They were found lying about 6 ft. deep in the boulder

clay. Height above sea, about 260 ft.

    ' A curious annual custom is observed at Hare Pie Bank, which may be connected
with the boundary of the jjavish. A large meat pie is made, and is placed, with a

wooden bottle, in a large hole, in the presence of representatives from certain
villages. The meat pie is distributed, but a struggle takes place for possession of
the wooden bottle with the representatives from the adjoining villages. This confers
upon the village obtaining possession of the bottle certain privileges for the year.
Whether this remarkable ceremony has any connection with the large erratic as
marking the boundary could not be ascertained.
--142 EEPORT 1883.

   --Leicester Forest and Kirhy Muxloe. On the road from Leicester to

Hinckley, about 4i miles from the former place, is a large boulder in an

orchard, showing only a small piece about 2 ft. square. On being un-

covered it was found to be 6 ft. X 4ft. X 4 ft. 6 in. This block has never been

moved, and is lying in the drift ; the longer axis is in the direction of the

north. No strice are visible. It is of the coarse-grained Markfield syenite,

distant about four miles north-west. The block is angular, some angles

as sharp as if recently quarried.

In an adjoining field on the west side of this orchard are two large

blocks ; size, each about 8 ft. x 2 ft. x 2 ft. each. Some edges are

rounded, others very sharp and angular. They are of Markfield syenite,

distant about four miles. They are said to have been moved about four

yards from a depression in the ground. No strias are seen.

Not many yards to the north of the above spot is a group of four

blocks,  two  of them  about 4 ft. x 2 ft.      x6 in.  2 ft. ;                         the                          others  are

irregular cubes of about 2 feet.

A further group occurs not many yards from this group ; average

xsize, 3 ft.  2 ft. 6 in. X 2 ft.   These are lying on the surface.                                                  Both

these groups are of Markfield syenite, distant about four miles.

The mean height at which all these boulders are found may be taken

at about 290 to 300 ft.

    On the turnpike road from Leicester to Hinckley, near the fifth mile-

stone, is a group of three blocks, the largest 3 ft. x 2 ft. x 2 ft. This
group is of Markfield syenite, distant about 3^ miles north-west. N.B.
In these irregular-shaped blocks, the longest side each way is always

measured.

On the footpath from the Hinckley road to Kirby Muxloe, is a large

erratic buried in the drift, the top of which only is exposed. Size 4 ft.

6 in. X 3 ft. -, being buried in the drift the depth is not known.

   A recent bench-mark has been carved on this stone, the height of which

can be fiveu wheia the new Ordnance map of this district is published.

This block is also of Markfield syenite, distant about three miles

north-west. No strite are seen.

Near a farm-yard in the next field to this bench-marked block, is a

group of   three blocks, one 3 ft.  x  3 ft.  6 in.  x  2 ft.                      the  others smaller.
                                                                                ;

These are also of Markfield syenite.

--Kirly Muxloe.- In the village of Kirby Muxloe is a group of seven

blocks. Average size 3 ft. x 2 ft. 6 in. x 2 ft. They are of Markfield

syenite. No striae observed.

In another part of the village is a group of four blocks, from the same

locality. Size 2 ft. x 2 ft. X 1 ft.

I counted more than a hundred blocks, of sizes varying from 2 ft.

6 in. to 1 ft., built into old walls and foundations of houses, which must

formerly have been lying in the drift about the village.

In a cottage garden    in the       village is  an   isolated                      block                             size 4 ft.  X
                                                                                                                  ;

2 ft. X 2 ft., of Markfield syenite. There are three distinct grooves in

this block.

     In the Manor House garden is another block, 4 ft. x 4 ft., partly

buried in the ground, but estimated to be 5 ft. deep. It is of Markfield

syenite.

     Numerous other boulders lie scattered in the fields, with only portions
exposed, of the same character of rock.
ON THE ERRATIC BLOCKS OF ENGLAND, WALES, AND IRELAND. 143

     One mile from Kirbj Muxloe, on the road to Newton Unthank,
is an isolated block bj the road-side. Size 4 ft. X 3 ft. x 2 ft. 6 in.
This fine block, witli sharp angular sides, has never been known to
have been moved, and is of the Avhifce variety of syenite from Markfield.

     The whole of these isolated and groups of boulders, described under
this head, are spread over an area of about two miles long by half a

mile wide, the longer direction being south-east of Markfield, from

whence they are supposed to have been derived. Some are entirely

exposed, others are partly bui-ied in the drift, which lies very thick in

the valleys, but on some of the uplands is not many inches deep. From
observations made some miles further to the south-east, there would

appear to be a continuous line of these erratics from the syenitic rocks

round Markfield and Groby. There must still be many thousands buried
in the drift, as in any comparatively shallow excavation made over this

area, erratic blocks are sure to be met with.

 --Hertfordshire. Mr. H. G. Fordham contributes records of erratics and

notes referring to several parishes in the north of Hertfordshire, in con-

tinuation of his former Report on that district.

--Kelshall. The village of Kelshall is situated about 500 ft. above sea-

level on the ridge of the chalk outcrop bounding the watershed of the

Thames on the north, and dividing it from that of the Cam or Rhee.

This ridge, with the country to the south within the watershed of the

Thames, is covered with boulder clay ; on the north, in the valley of

the Rhee, and to the north-west, in the district draining into the Ivel,

some of the more prominent hills and transverse ridges are capped with

patches of boulder clay (as at Ashwell, Report, 1881, p. 207 et seq., and

at Bygrave). The two following boulders, when they were examined in

September 1880, were lying together in a grass field, near the end of a

cart-shed, on the north side of the road leading into the village from the

west, and about 100 yards north of the church, upon the ridge already

referred to, just on the dividing line or water-parting between the Thames

and Rhee.

1. Smoothed, with five fiat, or nearly flat, facets on the top and sides

--as it now stands. Mr. J. Vincent Elsden, F.G.S., describes the material

from a small specimen as : ' Very much decomposed throughout. The

interior shows traces of an original dark crystalline rock, containing

much magnetite which has weathered reddish-brown. Felspar crystals

(probably plagioclase) are distinguishable. Probably dolerite.' 3 ft.

4 in. X 2 ft. 9 in. X 2 ft.

2. Roughly I'homboidal, much worn, and the upper surfaces, and to

some extent the sides, furrowed by atmosphei'ic action. Compact lime-

stone : mountain limestone.  x x2 ft. 7 in.
                             2 ft. 6 in.     2 ft.

  --Bijgrave. Bygrave adjoins Ashwell on the south-west. The church

and a few houses and cottages, hardly amounting to a village, stand on
the summit of a low isolated hill, within the area draining into the Ivel.
The whole of the higher part of this hill is covered with boulder clay,

its highest elevation being about '320 ft. above sea-level (bench-mark on
church 314 ft.). The only boulder of any size lies on the top of the hill,
on the side of the road, about 70 yards west of the church :

     Yellowish, compact sandstone. About 3 ft. X 2 ft. X 2 ft.
144 REPORT-- 1883.

   --Eitchin. The town of Hitchin, on tlie Hiz, a tributary of tbe Ivel,

lies at an elevation of about 220 ft. above the sea-level (bench-mark

on church 21G ft.). On the vrest and north-west of the town are
hills capped by thick beds of glacial gravel. From one of these, in
ancient workings for gravel, the boulders now lying near in the stable-
yard at The Hermitage have, no doubt, been obtained. They now lie

about 212 ft. above sea-level, but if derived from the adjacent hill they
m.ay be estimated to have been originally deposited at a level perhaps
50 ft. higher. In the large excavations for chalk adjoining the Hitchin
Railway Station, a good section of sand and gravel is exposed above the
chalk. Large boulders have been obtained from this gravel, and some

of these now lying on the floor of the pit are described below. Their
original elevation above sea-level may be estimated at 240 to 280 ft.

                                 Boulders lying in the stable yard, The Hermitage.

                       ;

Yellow sandy limestone, containing numerous large helemnites, and some

ostrece or gryphcem (?). Most probably lias marlstone.                                                                                                                           x5 ft.  2 ft.

In addition to the above, about 200 smaller boulders, varying from

6 in. long up to nearly 1 ft. and 1 ft. 6 in., are used to mark the margin

of the road. There is also amongst them a block of Hertfordshire

Pudding Stone, about 2 ft. x 1 ft. 9 in. x 6 in., angular and apparently

above sea-level the highest hills being capped with boulder clay con-
taining large boulders. It is also clear that as a rule the boulders of all
sizes, up to the largest known, are derived from the oolites and lias, pro-
bably of the Midland Counties, but that in addition there is a fair sprink-
ling of older rocks from further north. Carboniferous limestone and

millstone grit supply here and there a boulder of large size. Dark blue

--basalt is also not uncommon, and is occasionally found in blocks of a fair

size. Granites are rare two specimens only having been noted.

   --Anglesey. Professor Bonney, F.R.S., sends the following report:

   A visit to the district south-west of Ty Croes enables me to add

to the number of picrite boulders already recorded ('Quart. Jour. Geol.
Soc' vol. xxxvii. p. 137, and vol. xxxix. p. 254). From Ty Croes station
a road runs south-west. Taking tirst turn to the right, after crossing a

field, I found in a field to right of the lane a fragment of a boulder
(measuring by estimate about 2 ft. x 1^ ft. X 1^ ft. of picrite of the ordinary
type described in the above papers. About half-way between this spot
and a farm-house seven fragments of a large boulder are built into the
wall by the roadside : three of these are quite 2 ft. in diameter, the rest
smaller. Outside the buildings of a second farm along the same lane are
two fragments of picrite, the larger about Sh ft. X 2h ft. X 1^ ft. ; the longest

diameter of the other being about 2^ ft. On the sandy shore at Forth

Noble, some distance to the north of the boulder described in the second
of the above papers, lies a large subangular boulder of the usual picrite,

measuring about 4 ft. X 4 ft. X 2 ft. On my return by the Frondwl specimen

I found fragments of another picrite boulder about 80 yards nearer the
church, built into the base of the wall (vegetation will generally conceal

these). On looking again at the boulders in the Cromlech Barclodiad-y-
gawras I felt some doubt as to the correctness of my former identification

 of picrite ('Loc. Cit.' vol. xxxix. p. 254), but without injuring the stones
it is difficult to be sure. It is, however, evident that, at any rate in this part

of Anglesey, boulders of hornblende-picrite are rather common. I may add
that during a stay of a few days at Penmaenmawr I did not see a single

picrite boulder, though erratics are abundant, as there is boulder drift on
the lower ground.

Ten years having elapsed since your Committee was appointed at Belfast,

they think this a fitting opportunity to review the results so far obtained,
and to point out where they consider additional information is still required,

in the hope that they may receive assistance in their investigations from
the various local societies or from individuals who may be disposed to

aid in the work.

    Composition of the Committee.--The Chairman of the Committee,

Professor Hull, F.R.S., and the Secretary, Mr. De Ranee, F.G.S.,

were appointed in 1874 ; the nine reports have been drawn up by the
latter. Of the original Committee, Professor Prestwich, P.R.S., Messrs.

Morton, J. Plant, W. Whitaker, and the Rev. Dr. Crosskey also still

serve. The Committee have lost by death Professor Harkness, F.R.S.,

Mr. Binney, F.R.S., Mr. Charles Moore, F.G.S., and Mr. W. Molyneux,
all of whom have rendered important assistance, as have the following,

who have retired from the Committee : Messrs. Mellard Reade, C.E.,
Tylden Wright, H. H. Howell, Fox-Strangways, and Lowe, F.R.s!
General assistance has been given by the following, who have since
retired from the Committee: Sir Frederick Bramwell, F.R.S the Rev

W. S. Symons, and Mr. R. W. Mylue, F.R.S.

    The members of the Committee who took charge of districts and have

carried out the heavy work of the inquiry, were in the Midlands, Mr. James
Plant, Mr. W. Molyneux, and Mr. H. Marten; in the south-west of

England, Messrs. Pengelly, Moore, and Stooke (the latter has obtained

directing public opinion to the value of such supplies, and by the pre-
servation of the records of those carried out, has given an impetus to water
of this class being generally adopted for domestic consumption in districts

--where gravitation supplies are unsuitable or unattainable.
     As regards the first head of inquiry the circulation of underground

--waters much remains to be learnt, especially as to the influence of

variation of barometrical pressure on the volume of springs. Indepen-

dent investigation is now being carried on by Mr. Baldwin Latham, but

it is exceedingly desirable that numerous observations should bo taken
in different classes of rocks, the quantity of water a rock is capable of
holding being no measure of the quantity of water it is capable of yield-
ing. The difference of the period of time in which two rocks will absorb,
and give off by gravity, the same quantity of water is governed by the

difference of their chemical composition.

      The chemical composition of two rocks being identical, their facility
of discharge of water is in direct relation, to the amount by which they

are traversed by planes of joints and fissures, and the extent these may

run parallel or at right angles to the valleys which cut into and expose

 the water-bearing beds.

      The proportion of the annual rainfall that is absorbed by different
classes of rocks is a subject that requires further examination. The
 quantity is largely regulated by the quantity stored from previous years.
 After a succession of dry years the permanent water-level is reduced to
 minimum figures, and the water gradient becomes nearly flat and springs
 cease to flow. The first heavy rains will be nearly wholly absorbed, until

the maximum water-gradient is reached and the rocks are stored with

 the largest amount of water they can hold. After they are once charged,
 all excess of rainfall runs off in floods, and the amount absorbed is prac-
 tically nil. Spread over the twelve months, the annual amount absorbed
 is probably never more than 15 inches, and the average ranges from
 5 inches in chalk countries to 10 inches in new red sandstone areas.
 In millstone grit districts about 8 inches are absorbed, but the permeable
 beds are thin, and the water is thrown off again in numerous springs, as
 a rule in the same drainage basin, giving permanence to the dry- weather
 flow of the streams traversing them. Except in WaterivorJcs drainage 1
 areas but few observations exist as to the actual volumes run off daily

 by the rivers of this country, and data on this subject are much required,

 as well as a permanent record of the height to which floods rise in the

  various river-basins.

       Further observations are required as to the action of faults in acting
 as ducts, along the face of which water is constantly passing, and barriers

 separating districts into distinct drainage areas. The facts so far obtained

 point to faults traversing thick permeable sandstone and limestone, having-
  these formations on both sides of the dislocation, as offering no obstacle
  to the free passage of waters, which, even if locally obstructed by the-

 hardened face or slickenside jointing of the fault, invariably finds its way

  through cracks extending across the width of the fault. In faults traversing
  thick shales and clays of any age, the fissure, be it wide or narrow, always,
  appears to have been filled with the impermeable material forming the

  sides, and in some cases, when porous rocks have been immediately over-
  lain hj impermeable material since denuded, the fissure of the fault has
  been filled from above at a time when the fault had an upward prolonga-

  tion, destroyed with the above-mentioned denuded material.

     The daily registi-ation of the heights of the streams might easily be
made on gauges, painted on the county bridges, but the organisation
necessary to carry this out is entirely beyond the scope of the British
Association, and should be carried out at the national charge, being of

the highest importance to the country.

     The determination of the number of cubic feet of water, carried down

at selected points on the English rivers, particularising whether it repre-
sents dry-iveather, avei-age, or flood-flow, would be of very high value, and
mi^ht well be undertaken by the Association. Such observations, stating
the run off per square mile of drainage area and the geological character
of the area drained, would have more than a local value.

    Permeable rocks below the permanent water-level of a district may be

regarded as a reservoir of which the cubic content is limited by the size
of the spaces between the grains, and the width of the fissures and cracks

by which the rock may be traversed. The quantity of water such rocks are
capable of storing, has had much light thrown upon it by the investigations

of 'Mr. Wethered, published in the fourth appendix to the eighth report.

     The following figures give an abstract of his results as to some of the
most typical rocks examined by him :

   --Underground Water in the Oolites at Birdlip, near Gloucester. The

escarpment overhanging the Vale of the Severn, near Gloucester, consists

--of the following sequence of oolitic rocks at Leckhampton Hill :

            Great Oolite         20 feet.
            Fuller's Earth .   264 ,,
            Inferior Oolite ,
            Lias Sands           28 ,,
            Upper Lias Clay    202 ,,

     The Great Oolite and the upper part of the Fuller is permeable, and
the water is supported by the very impermeable layer occurring at the
base of the Fuller's Earth. Water traverses the Inferior Oolite freely,

especially through the numerous joint planes by which it is traversed, and
descends into the Lias Sands, which constitute an important underground

reservoir, supported by the lias clays, which throw out numerous springs.
The dip of all the beds is eastwards, or from the escarpment into the hill ;
for the dip of the rocks forming the actual scarp is directly modified by
a slip caused by the drag of the hill, the dip being toward the plain

beneath. This has an important influence on the direction of the water-

flow, the position of which has been determined with much accuracy at
Birdlip in a series of borings made by the Gloucester Corporation AVater-

works, for the journals of which I have to thank Mr. T. H. Fryer, Town

Clerk of Gloucester.

-whicli appears to be referable to the boulder clay, but as to the age of

the lower part there appears to be much uncertainty. No Glacial Clay

is known to occur in the district at so great a depth. The Keuper

Marls cannot be present unless they are let in by unknown trough faults,

and if present can only occupy a very small area ; while the Permian

Marls, and the Clay beds of the Upper Coal measures, do not attain in

this area the great thickness observable in this boring ; nor does the sur-

face evidence afforded by the surrounding country support the view of

their being referable to either of those formations. In the hope that

some light might be thrown on the problem by microscopical examination,

I submitted the samples to Mr. J. A. Phillips, F.R.S., who has kindly

examined them, and reports as follows :

' The plastic red specimen (395 feet) is a fine clay, strongly coloured

by oxide of iron, and apparently contains patches of greyish boulder clay.

After being attacked by hydrochloric acid it became perfectly colourless,

and this white residue consists of clay containing fragments of angular

quartz, with a substance which is probably kaolinite, resulting from the

decomposition of felspars.

'The coarser sample (Hall "Wood, 4*14 feet) is like the former, but

with a larger proportion of angular quartz, in fragments varying from

ToVo to TFiT iiich in diameter. The clay does not appear to contain any

particle of boulder clay.'

     1. Scalford Road, near Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, la. Boring commenced
1882; finished March 1883. 2. About 250 feet. 3. Depth 556 feet; diameter
about 4 inches. 4. No pumping, but water stands at 120 feet from the surface.
6. Not observed. 8. No analysis yet made.

                                                                                                  Depth of rocks

It is supposed this latter is the Upper Keuper sandstone, and it proves the existence
of the Triassic rocks five miles further to the east than the known boundary in this
county. 9a. Several gypsum bands yielded water as well as the sandstone. 12.

A large fault distant about two miles to the N., bringing up the middle beds of the

lias. This fault runs due E. and W., and is about thirty miles long. 14. None
known. 16. Further operations are contemplated.

The specific gravity of the water (1-0060) is very great. The water is quite clear and

limpid to the eye, and has a brackish taste, but contains not the slightest organic
impurity. By continuous pumping for some weeks the solids in solution have been

reduced from 650 (parts in 100,000 parts) to 465, and it is fully expected that further

pumping will greatly reduce this quantity. 9. See Report for 1882 for description

of rocks down to 705 feet 2 inches.

At this latter level it remains. 5. The quantity of water capable of being pumped
at the time of completing the operations was 150,000 gallons in the twenty-four

hours, being more than four times the quantity required for the present supply of the

town of Wem. 6. The water-level due.5 not appear to be aSected by local Tains,

and it stands (7) about 24 feet under the level of water in the neighbouring water-

lO and 11. There was a little surface water finding its way through the 2 feet of sand,

but it is entirely kept out of the well, and also out of the bore-hole. 12. The well
is situated about 600 yards from the outcrop of the marl measures on the west. 13

and 14. There are no salt springs known to exist in the neighbourhood. 15. No

wells have been discontinued in the neighbourhood in consequence of the water being

brackish.

            Collected ly Mr. TJiomas S. StooJce, C.E.

1. The ' Mine Well,' in the parish of ' The Clive,' Shropshire, la. The well was

sunk in 1868, and has not been deepened since. 2. The well is about 373 feet above

mean sea-level. 3. The depth of well is 183 feet ; diameter, 8 feet. There is a

bore-hole, but depth has not been ascertained. 3a. There is one drift- way at bottom

of well, about 40 feet in length. 4. The water-level is 142i feet from the surface.
4«. The level of water has not varied since the bore-hole was put down. 5. The

quantity of water capable of being pumped is considerable. The water is at present

only drawn by means of a windlass, for the use of adjoining houses. 6. The water-

level has not varied. 7. The water-level is not affected by local rains, and stands

about 233 feet above mean sea-level. 8. Analvsis by Dr. Voelcker, dated September

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor W. C. William-
   son, Mr. Thos. Hick, and Mr. W. Cash (Secretary), appointed

   for the purpose of investigating the Fossil Plants of Halifax.

We regret to have to state that our efforts to investigate the Fossil

Carboniferous Flora of Halifax have been less successful this year than

in the previous one. The reason for this is sufficiently obvious. All the

more abundant objects characteristic of the locality are now well under-

stood. The gaps that need to be filled are connected either with the

rarer forms, or with unusual conditions of the more common plants.

WeNevertheless we have not been wholly -without success.  have

obtained clear evidence of the existence of at least two new types of

-- ARachiopteris which are most probably stems or petioles of ferns.

third one is a curious stem, in which the vascular bundle approaches

that of a Lepidodendrbn in its defined cylindrical form, surrounding a

cellular pith, a condition rarely seen amongst ferns. But we have found

no traces of leaves attached to it, as is always the case with the young

twigs of Lepidodendra.

Another stem is an undoubted Lepidodendron of a very interesting

type. Its central vasculo-medullary axis corresponds closely with that of

Lepidodendron selaginoides, except that the barred or reticulated medul-

lary cells of that species are absent from the new plant. Like L. selagi-

noides the new form has a secondary exogenous vascular zone of barred

vessels, but of a primitive type that is intermediate between the perfect

condition of that zone in L. selaginoides, and its extremely rudimentary

form in L. Harcourtii. In the transverse section the zone appears more

perfectly and regularly developed than in L. Harcourtii, which plant it

also resembles in the extremely small size of its vessels ; but its most

characteristic feature is shown in the longitudinal section, in which we

find these numerous secondary vessels meandering as they ascend

through a mass of cellular tissue, so that in such sections cells and vessels

appear to be intermingled without order or special arrangement.

   We have obtained a series of roots or rootlets which have much of the

general aspect of those of Stigmaria. But they possess the very dis-

tinctive feature of giving off secondary rootlets in perfect verticils, a

Wevery unusual feature in fossil root-organs.  have also obtained further

illustrations of the presence of tylose-cells in the interior of the tissues

of other plants. For some time we were only acquainted with these I

curious growths in the interiors of the vessels of ferns. But we have

now obtained them in the vessels of a Lepidodendron stem, and also in

the cortical cells of some ferns, as well as in those of the Lyginodendron

Oldhamsinm. We may further add that new fragments continue to

be met with, showing the existence in these beds of strange forms of

plant- life, of the nature and general morphology of which we are wholly

ignorant. Snch fragments are like a few scattered grains of gold at

some new ' dig^jings.' They afford a strong stimulus to further research,

·since they at'e proofs that unrevealed treasures continue to be hidden in

these Yorkshire and Lancashire carboniferous nodules.

Fourth Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. H. C. Sorby
   and Mr. G. E. Vine, appointed for the purpose of reporting on

  Fossil Polyzoa. Drawn %ip by Mr. Vine (Secretary).

                                       Part I.
              Cretaceous Polyzoa. British area only.

The Polyzoa of tLe Cretaceous epoch, especially in foreign localities, liave

been closely studied by Paleontologists, and many valuable memoirs

published by foreign authors. In his ' Petrifacta Germanise,' Goldfuss

described and figured nearly fifty species. Hagenow, in his Palieonto-
logical works, accepts many ol: those previously described by Goldfuss
and other authors, renames some, and adds to them nearly two hundred

species besides. D'Orbigny also adds considerably to the number of

Cretaceous species, discovei-ed in the beds in the neighbourhood of Paris,
and his admirable figures of some of these have increased very largely our

knowledge of their varied forms. The rich Cretaceous beds of America

have been partly investigated by Mr. Ulrich and by other American

authors, but only a few species are, as yet, fully described, and many of

the species are still undescribed.

Sir H. P. De la Beche, in his apology for the inti'oduction of the

elaborate lists of organic remains in his 'Geological Manual,'' says:

' Considerable attention has certainly been paid to such catalogues, as the

zoological character of certain rocks is now the subject of much research,
and as the result of such investigations may be the knowledge of some

of the principal conditions under which the fossiliferous rocks were pro-

duced. Moreover, the author considered that, for practical purposes,

there was no alternative between rendering them as perfect as his means

of information wculd permit, and omitting them altogether. It must,

however, be confessed that, though constructed from apparently the best

authorities, these lists require severe examination, for, unfortunately, the

study of organic remains is beset with two evils, which, though of an

opposite character, do not neutralise each other so much as atiirst sight

may be anticipated                                                                                                       the one consisting           of  a strong  desire to find similar
                                                                                                                      :

organic remains in supposed equivalent deposits, even at great distances
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

the other being an equally strong inclination to discover new species,

often, as it would seem, for the sole purpose of appending the apparently

magical word nobis.' Between one and the other of these two extremes the

Palajontologist is almost sure to                                                                                        slide                        and though the caution, with its
                                                                                                                                                   ;

quiet innuendo, may be old, it is none the less valuable in an inquiry like

the present.

    The list of Cretaceous Polyzoa, given by De la Beche contains no

fewer than about fifty-six or fifty-eight species. Many of these bear the
name of Goldfuss, but it is impossible to say whether the author intended

the list as a British, or merely as a Cretaceous one. In all probability it
was the latter. In his ' Catalogue of British Fossils,' Professor Morris

admits about eighty species, distributed amongst thirty-five genera, many

of these bearing the names of French authors. Professor John Phillips,

--in his work on ' The Geology of Oxford and the Valley of the Thames,'

furnishes a list about forty-eight species--of British Cretaceous

Polyzoa. In Dr. Mantell's woi'ks, and also in Dixon's ' Geology of

Snssex,' many species are partially described and figured.
    The best stratigraphical list of species known to me is the one

furnished by Mr. Newton in the ' Catalogue of Fossils in the School of

--Mines Cretaceous Division,' and as this is an account of actual speci-

mens gathered from various horizons and from very wide localities in the
British area, I shall make it the basis of this Report. As I have only

partially examined the collection, I must depend upon the species in my
own cabinet, and those lent to me by Miss E. C. Jelly, for furnishing

the minute details necessary for this Report. It may be as well, however,

to give the various horizons in which Polyzoa have been discovered and

catalogued.

special reason that I find in the catalogues of collectors and others that

the species is very loosely identified. In the specimen before me three

cells occupj' a line and a half, but the cells vary in length, and the

average may be taken as three cells to a line and a quarter, or a line and

a half. Genei'ally the branching takes place at the distance of three cells
apart, an inflated cell (ooscia) occupying the apex of a branch just below

the node. Though distinct from, this species is more closely related to
S. dichotomoides, D'Orb., than to any other of the Oolitic species ; the
latter, however, are more bulky in the size of the cells.

some extent the same type of cell found in many of the Biastoporidoi.

Still, as Mr. Hincks only includes in the adnate Diastopora ' discoid or

flabellate' forms, I have removed the species to the genus Stomatopora on

account of its closer resemblance to species of that genus. In all proba-

bility the ^Zecio refo'cwZato, D'Orb. (Brit, specimens), should likewise be
removed to this species as a synonym.

--Hincks, ' Brit. Mar. Polyzoa,' p. 4-50.

    This ' world-wide ' genus is, so far as I am acquainted at present,

very poorly represented in our British Cretaceous strata. Mr. Hincks

(' Brit. Mar. Polyzoa,' p. 451) says ' many charming forms occur in the

Cretaceous deposits,' but these I have not seen. In the Chalk Marl of

Charing we have a species very closely resembling Idmonea (Retepora)
disticha, Goldf. It is only found in minute fragments, but it may be

easily distinguished from the species of the next genus, by having the

zooecia disposed on the fi'ont of the branches only. There are also traces

of the delicate Idmonea Com-ptoniana, Mantell, but it is very rai'ely that

specimens can be found even half the size of the specimen figured by

Mantell. The author says : ' This delicate Polyzoou {coral, Mant.) is

dichotomons, cylindrical with elongated distinct cells, disposed in triplets

at regular distinct intervals on one side of the stem.' · Mantell also figures

and describes a species which he calls Idmonea Dixonia, but I cannot

identify the type. It ' is found in the chalk of Kent and Sussex, often

forming a cluster of branches two or three inches in circumference. The

surface of the stems is covered with minute pores, and the cells are

distinct and placed in single rows on the margin.' It is very well

illustrated in the ' Medals of Creation,' Lisrn., figs. 6 and 12, p. 284.

 . Many of the Idmonece (?) of the Cretaceous epoch described by

D'Orbigny, Mr. Busk places doubtfully with Stomatopora as synonyms.^

A mere casual refei'ence to the synonyms of Idmonea atlantica, Forbes,

will show how dangerous it would be to give specific names to the frag-

ments described above. I have, however, given a list of British species

described by Dixon and others.

     The genus Entalopltora, as defined and limited by Mr. Hincks, will
embrace a variety of species. The Spiroponi of both Jules Haime

(Oolitic Polyzoa, ' B. A. Rep' iii.) and Professor Reuss maybe con-
veniently included. There are, however, so many special features about

the Spiropone described by these authors, that I have for a long time

hesitated whether to continue with, or give up the further use of, the

--generic name. The clause in the above ' composed of decumbent tubes

--may be applied with perfect safety to most of the Mesozoic species,

and the adoption of the broader term will get rid of a number of genera

and species that have been founded upon habit only, rather than upon the

character and disposition of the cells in the zoar'mm.

The following analysis of genera and species will enable the palaeonto-

logist to appreciate more fully the varied character of the fossils which

the genus Entalophora will cover.

     The first species of Spiropora, Lamx., described by Haime in his

'Jurassic Bryozoa ' (1854), is S. elegans, Lamx., from the Great Oolite
of Ranville. This species is ' cespitose ' with cylindrical branches which

often coalesce. The same species is the Cricopora elegans of Blainville,

Bronn, Milne-Edw., and Michelin ; D'Orb. describes it as Splropora.

Another of the species of Lamouroux is S. ccespitosa, which, so far as the
character of the cells may be taken as evidence, may with equal propriety

be called (S'. elegans. Some specimens are rather more tufted, and the
lateral cells are slightly produced. The species is synonymous with *S.
capillaris, Lamx. This is also called by Blainville Cricopora, and Entalo-
phorahj D'Orb. The Millepora straniinea of Phillips (' t^eol. of York ') is,

by Haime, called ^piropora, by D'Orb. lutricaria (1850), Laterotuhigera
(1853), and Entalophora (1854). Our British specimens of this species
may, to some extent, justify the geneinc appellation lutricaria, Defranc,

on account of the continuous inosculation of the bi-anches. I may almost

affirm that the habit is an unvarying one as regards this species ; and a
similar species found in the Haldon Hill Greensand inosculates in the same

manner. But as I am following the Rev. Thomas Hincks in his classification,

it is impossible to accept ' habit ' as a generic characteristic in this Report.

The synonyms of the species are also very significant, and compel us to

limit the types. I cannot, however, agree with Professor D. Brauns

(' Bryozoa of the Middle Jura') that Ceriopnra verticillata is synonymous

with Phillips's species. Other species, also described by Haime as

Spiropora,                            are  Entalophora, D'Orb.                                                                                             or  Cricopora, Blainville.  Amongst
                                                                                                                                                        ;

Cretaceous fossils a similar mixture of generic terms (founded upon

habit chiefly) takes place, so that we may regard the terms Spiropora,

term ^ thus, we get rid of difficulties. Not a single genus has been,
founded by these various authors, which may not, under a different system

of estimating their value, have something said in favour of its continuous

adoption.

     I have been supplied by Mr. J. M. Nickles, of Cinncinati, with a few
of the Cretaceous Polyzoa from Arkansas in America, and, as these

--closely resemble species found in our own sti-ata I may say identical with

fragments.

The variable character of this polyzoon renders identification very

difficult indeed. The description and figures of Goldfuss are very good,

especially the figures, but apparently, in the diagnosis, but little regard has

been paid to growth. In the Lower Greensand of Farringdon the species

is very characteristic, and in all probability two or three others may be

reduced to mere synonyms of this well-marked type. The branches of

some of the specimens that I have in my cabinet are a half of a line in

diameter, whilst others are about y'^ of an inch in breadth yet the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

superficial characters of both are the same, only in the smaller specimens

there is a less number of cells to the transverse section. The following
may be accepted as the diagnosis of this species.

Zoarium ramose, cylindrical, rounded at the apices, or growing ex-

tremity; varying in diameter from tjj to -jL- of an inch. Zooecia con-

tiguous, showing the orifices of the cells only, tubes rarely, if ever, ex-

posed                              occasionally perfect, and, when this is the case, the surface of the

larger than in the more delicate E. gracilis.

     The above is the description of the species generally met with in the
Greensand of Farringdon. In the Greensand of Haldon Hill, Devon,

there is a species having a similar external pustulose character, but the

interspaces are porous ; so also is an apparently similar species found in
the Upper Chalk.

From the Cretaceous rocks of Pulaski Co., Arkansas,' I have a very

similar species to the above, and I have not the least doubt but that the

British and American forms may be considered identical.
     Under the genus Pustulopora, Blainv., Hagenow describes from the

=Maestricht beds ten species, and under Cricopora, Blainv. Spiropora,

Lamx., two species, some of which bear his own name, othei's are either

Ceriopora or Pustulopora species, of Goldfuss or Blainville. In the
Cretaceous Catalogue of Species in the School of Mines, only one is
referred to Eatalophora (^E. 7-amosi8sinia, D'Orb.), and one to Spiropora
(*S. cenomana, D'Orb.). Besides the above. Professor Morris, and also
Professor Phillips, add three others, none of which I can identify in

my own collection.

                  Genus DiASTOPOUA (Adnate), (part), Lamoui'oux.

     ' Zoarium adnate and crustaceous (or foliaceous), usually discoid, or
flabellate, less commonly irregular in form. Zooxia tubular, with an

--elliptical or subcircular orifice, crowded, longitudinally arranged, in great

part immersed.' ' Brit. Mar. Polyzoa,' vol. i. p. 457.

    Our British Cretaceous Diastopora are, so far as I am aware, very

limited in the number of species. In his ' Catalogue of Brit. Foss.' Professor

Morris gives the names of several, but I am only able to identify two

species in the Lower Greensand D. congesta, D'Orb., and D. p)ap%jracea,
D'Orb. D. Soii-erhii, Lonsdale, is not apparently a Diastopora, and D. ramosa,
Mich., in Dixon's ' Geo. of Sussex ' is a Stomatopora. I do not know the
D. Wetherelli of Morris. I have therefore described below a very fine
species from the Upper Chalk of Beachy Head (Miss Jelly's collection)
which I have provisionally named

                                  DiASTOPOKA CEETACEA (n. sp. ? ).

     Zoarium adherent with a nearly circular outliae, depressed in the

central part, very much thickened at the edges by stunted (partially ·

grown) cells, but without basal lamina. Zoacla irregularly arranged,
contracted towards the proximal and thickened at the distal extremities,
separated by interspaces ; orifice circular with a thickened peristome.

--Ooseia an inflated cell.

     The above is a true Diastopora, and specifically is very closely related
to D.oolitica,Yine (' Quart. Jour. Geo. Soc' August 1881), only that in
the Cretaceous species the cells are less crowded than in the Oolitic. The

cells and cell-orifices are similar, but the question with me is whether it

would be wiser to extend the description of D. oolitica so as to embrace
the more recent type, or whether we should keep the types of the two

epochs distinct. At the present time, and undei" present circumstances, I
think the latter would be the wiser course to adopt, and then, when our
British Polyzoa are better known, a closer alliance of types can be made.

I am unable, from the various works at my disposal, to identify

this peculiar Cretaceous Polj-zoon. The habit of the species is unlike

any other biserial Diasfopora known to me, both in the disposition of

Mythe zoo'cia and in the ribbon-like appearance of the zoarium.                                                         own

specimen is rather large, measuring one inch in length, and about a

half-inch in breadth, but the section of the bands, when examined in a

line, Avith the narrow back-to-back arrangement of the cells, shows the

same biserial character as in some of the leaf-like but free (not reticulate)

bands of the Oolitic epoch. There is a very striking likeness in this

species to Idmonea fenestrata, Busk (' Crag Polyzoa,' p. 105, PI. xv. fig. G),

but the bi'anches of that species are said to be sub-trigonal, and often

angular behind. In Miss Jelly's collection it is named D. lamosa?

Michelin. I cannot identify it as such.

pp. 471-2.
     This genus will include the following genera of D'Orbigny, but species

are not abundant in our British Cretaceous rocks.
      a. Confluent disks : Hadiopora, Unicavea (sp.), jDiscocavea (sp.).
     /3. Adnate with multiserial rays : Adinopora, Discoiuhigera. Mr.

Hincks says : ' The genus is widely distributed both in space and time
in the Cretaceous beds it is represented by a large number of beautiful

forms.'

     ' D'Orbigny has constrncted a large number of genera, which are

merely arbitrary groups based on very trivial modifications of this well-
marked type.'

                                     Genus Radiopoka, D'Orb.

'Zoarium adnate, crustaceous, spreading irregularly, and composed

of confluent disks like those of Discoporella ; surface reticulate or can-

cellous cells disposed in serial lines, radiating from the centres of the

constituent disks.'--Busk, ' Cyclostomata,' p. ?4.

     In the Lower Greensand and also in the Chalk we have species that

are and may be referred to this genus. In Prof. Morris's, Cat. Brit. Poss.'

two species are named B. pjishdosa, D'Orb., and E. millepora, D'Orb.

both of which are before me, but there is a great difi'erence in the two

Atypes.  species from the Chalk (Freshwater Bay, Isle of Wight) very

closely resembles one of the figures of Ceriopora diadema, Goldfuss.

In retaining the genus Badiopora Mr. Busk remarks : ' In the majority

of the fossil species referred by M. D'Orbigny to this genus, the zoaria are

more or less rounded or bulbous, owing to the superposition of layer upon-

layer of the confluent disks ; but in one, B. Francquana (1, c. p. 997, pi. 782,
figs. 3-8 'Pal. Franc.') this superposition would seem to have taken

place only to a very slight extent. In the two living forms I have re-

ferred to the same genus there is no superposition at all ; but as the mode

of growth is in other respects so exactly in accord with M. d'Orbigny's

excellent description, I have not thought it expedient to institute another

genus, or even subgenus, merely on that account.'

' Colony simple, or composed of many confluent disks.' Certainly L. Ms-

pida, Flem., var. memidrina, Peach, bears a close resemblance to one of the

Lower Greensand species, but in the absence of the peculiar markings about

the orifice of the zocecia in the fossil species I prefer to accept the

authority of Busk rather than displace the species from the genus Badio-

pora, for the present at least.

     The Lower Greensand specimen is very large, frequently containing
from twenty to thirty layers, and each layer composed of a number of disks,
and the pe^iuliar radial character of each disk may be examined if a group
of them are slightly rubbed. It appears to me, however, that one specific

--name will indicate the superficial character of the Greensand specimens.

     This species is very different from the above, both in the character of
the zoaria and in their general arrangement ; but in the absence of
sections showing the structure of the cells the superficial characters are

--comparatively useless in recent classifications.

?v I have specimens of this beautiful species from the Chalk (Fresh-

water Bay). The zoarium is delicate and star-like, but I am unable to say

anything about the structure of the cells. I merely refer to its existence

as a British fossil in the hope that Palaeontologists living in the Isle of

Wight may have their attention directed to this as well as other species

of Polyzoa.

               Genus Domopora, D'Orb.

     ' Zoarium massive, cylindrical or mammiform, simple or lobed,
formed of a number of sub-colonies superimposed one upon the other,
the whole surface porous. Zooicia. disposed in radiating lines, consisting
of one or more series, on the free extremity of the stem or lobes.'
Hincks, 'Brit. Mar. Polyzoa,' p. 481.

     In this genus Mr. Hincks includes Defrancia (pars), Ceriopora
(pars), Goldf., and SteMipora (pars), Hagenow, and the first species
described, in 'Brit. Mar. Polyzoa,' is the beautiful Cretaceous fossil,
D. stellata := Ceriopora id., Goldfuss. The one described is a recent
species, nevertheless Mr. Hincks refers it to Goldfuss's type. I have
never met with it as a British Cretaceous species.

     The geographical distribution and range in time are given by Mr.
Hincks thus : 'Norway, from Bergea to Bejan, 40-60 fath. (Sars). In

stratis arenoso-margaceis Westphalice, Goldf. ; Austro-Hungarian Miocene,

     In this familj, further on, I shall include the whole of the Fossil
Polyzoa which have two sorts of openings on the surface, ' cells ' and
'ostioles.' They are not a large group, but the species have distinct

characters.

     I have already pointed out the varied sources of information re-
.specting Seteropora (' Brit. Assoc. Rep.' mihi, 1882, Fossil Polyzoa),
both recent and fossil. Since this was written Mr. Ulrich in his
' American Palisozoic Bryozoa ' has published descriptions of Heteropora

from the Chalk of Arkansas, and I have been furnished by Mr. J. M.
Nickles with specimens of Mr. Ulrich's species, and I cannot help re-
marking that there is a wonderfully close correspondence between the
American and the British Cretaceous forms, so much so that it is diflBcnlt

to distinOg'uish between them.

                                Genus Heteropora, Blainville.

     ' Zoarium erect, cylindrical, undivided or branched, surface even,

orifices of the cells, and the smaller the ostioles of the interstitial canals or

--tubes.' Busk, ' Crag Polyzoa,' p. 120. (For synonyms see Busk.)

             ,, ,, Morris, ' Cat. Brit. Foss.'

As Mr. Busk remarks (' Crag Polyzoa,' p. 126) : ' Thei-e are no

means of judging correctly with respect to the Heteropora really intended

by Goldfuss, except what are afforded by his very defective figures.'

The several species described by Mr. Busk in the ' Crag Polyzoa' have

the merit of being exact on minor details, and they are well illustrated,

but there is one remark that I cannot resist directinor attention to before

describing the British Cretaceous Heteropora. In speaking of H. re-

ticulata, Busk (unfortunately no figure is given of this species), the author

says (p. 125) : ' The peculiar characteristic of H. reticxiZata is the coarsely
sulcate or I'eticulate aspect of the surface, which bears, in some respects,

a strong resemblance to that of a Hornera, whence, as well as from the

smallness of the interstitial pores and canals, this species may be regarded

as intermediate between Hornera and Heteropora.' And Mr. Busk regards

the species described as H. Icevigata ? D'Orb. ('Crag Polyzoa,' pp. 125-6)
as a probable link between these two genera and Cricopora, ' and perhaps

as affording an additional proof of the artificiality of the not very

satisfactory classification we are at present compelled to adopt of these

Polyzoa.'

As I have carefully worked over the Heteropora oi. the Cretaceous

myepoch, I will give brief results of  investigations, reserving for future

work more elaborate details.

to place this species here, temporarily at least. Is this, however,
synonymous with Haime's species ?

     As referred to previously there is present in the Greensand of
Haldon Hill, Devon, a species very similar, in external characters, to

Entalophora pustulosa, only that the orifices of the cells are smaller, the
intermediate spaces are pitted, and the interstitial openings few in
number. Eight cells occupy the space of a line in a longitudinal direc-

tion.

      Heteropora tenera, Hagenow.

= Ceriopora cryptopora (pars), Goldfuss,

     In the Lower Greensand, Farringdon, and also the Upper Greensand,
Warminster, is a delicate species of Heteropora which Morris catalogues
as H. tenera, Hagenow. There is but little difTerence in the structure of
this species and the lai'ger H. crassa, Hagenow, which is selected by the
author from Goldfuss's as his type. Goldfuss includes the large and
the small in his G. cryptopora, but Hagenow divides the honours and
founds two types upon the one form. It is best, however, to refer to the
labours of Hagenow, because if 'form &c.' were a character on which

species could be accepted, the labours of this distinguished Palaeontologist

would prove of great advantage to the systematist. Hagenow's species
are H. crassa, Hag., H. dichotoma, Goldf., H. undulata, Hag., H. tenera,
Hag., H. Dumonti, Hag.

     In giving descriptions of American Cretaceous Heteropora, Mr. Ulrich
remarks ('Amer. Palgeoz. Bryozoa ' (Cin. Soc. Nat. Hist. p. 143, 1882)
that ' the species from Ai'kansas is nearly allied to Zonopora variabilis;
D'Orb., from the Cretaceous of France.' The other species which the
author describes and figures are H. consimilis, Ulrich, and H. attenuata,

Ulrich.

                                 Sub-order Cheilostomata, Busk.

Our British Cretaceous Cheilostomata are very limited in the number

of species, but I believe that if a diligent search could be made our lists

Momswould be added to considerably. Prof.  in his ' Catalogue ' gives

only thirteen species, and I am unaware of the existence of any further

additions to this list by British authors. In his Division D, Urceolata,

Hagenow catalogues five species of Vincularia, fifty-four species of

LJschara, three species of Siphonella, Hag., thirty-three species of Celle-

p)ora (Goldf. and Hag.), one species of Stichopora, Hag., two species of

ALunulites, and five doubtful forms.  richness which we should be

will therefore give short notes of the species that have come under my

     In Miss Jelly's collection there is a small specimen marked Marginaria,

but it does not appear to me to be a young colony of M. Roemeri. There

is in the specimens the same semicircular mouth, but the front of the cell
is raised not depressed, and smaller cells of the same character intervene
between the lai'ger.

     This species is found in large and small patches. In the general
arrangement and character of the cells this seems to remind one of the

recent M. Lacroixii, Audouin. The Cretaceous fossil is much more com-

pressed in the colonial growth than I have ever seen in the recent species,
but none of the areas of the cells are like M. Savartil, Aud., which Mr.

--Busk (' Crag Polyzoa,' p. 31) identifies with M. Lacroixii.

     Prof. Reuss, in his ' Alpine Tertiary Polyzoa,' figures a specimen of

M. Hookeri which resembles so closely the Cretaceous specimen before
me, that I can hardly assign to it any other name. There is a larger
colonial growth in the Cretaceous specimen than in any of the Tertiary

specimens in my possession, and the walls are thicker ; in other respects

the resemblance between the Cretaceous and the Eocene species is
remarkably close. With some little doubt, however, I place it as an

allied form, rather than give to it a new name.

     As some of the family and also the generic names will be retained in
this Report, it may be advisable to direct attention to a few particulars
furnished by the author.

     The sub-class in which the Permian Polyzoa are placed by Prof.
King is the Ciliohrachiate of Farre, and the synonyms of the sub-class
are given by him in the following order : Polyzoa, J. V. Thompson
Beyozoa, Ehrenberg ; Zoophyta Ascidoida, Johnston ; Polypes Tuniciens,
Milne-Edwards. ' The divisions Infundihulata and Hippocrepia proposed
by M. Gervais, as based chiefly on difference of . habitat, whether marine

or fresh-water, appear so divested of the necessary structural in-
dividualitj', and of so little value compared with the orders already

noticed, that in place of adopting them it seems a m.uch safer plan to
regard the Ciliobrachiates as resolvable into only one order, for which

Ehrenberg's name Bryozoa may be very conveniently retained.' '

One of the earliest and best classifications of the Polyzoa as a distinct

group is that furnished by Mr. Bask in the second of these two works.

As much, however, of the introduction and synoptical arrangements has

more direct reference to a suborder that is very poorly represented in

strata below and in the Cretaceous, I may be allowed to pass this over

and confine my remarks to the second suborder, Cj/closiomafa, Busk. In

the synoptical arrangement of this group Mr. Busk included genera

belonging to the Mesozoic and Cainozoic epochs only ; except in a few

rare cases, there was no provision made for Palseozoic genera or species.

In speaking of his own labours Mr. Busk says : ' Owing to the great

comparative simplicity and uniformity of conformation in the individual

cells, and the absence for the most part of adventitious organs such as

ovicells and vibricular or avicularian organs, our principal reliance in

the distinction of genera and species must be placed on the general form

of the zoarium                                                        and the mutual relation of the cells ;  but as in many cases
                                                                   '

these vary very greatly in different portions of one and the same zoarium,

it often happens, more especially in fossil forms, that it is almost im-

possible to determine whether two apparently distinct things may not

be referable to one and the same species. These observations apply more

forcibly perhaps to Pustulopora, Idmonea, and Hornera, than to any other

genera, but should be taken into account in several others also.' ^

     To a large extent this synopsis has been accepted and followed hj
many leading naturalists in their arrangement of this group at least.

Professor Reuss, in his varions writings after the publication of the 'Crag
Polyzoa,' adopted the arrangement with very slight modifications, and

Dr. Manzoni followed Reuss, but Professor F. A. Roemer in his ' Poly-
parien des Norddeutschen Tertiiir-Gebirges,' ^ divides the group thus:

D'Orbigny, some few are still retained in our scientific literature, four

only are founded by Professor Roemer.

     It must not be supposed, because I pass over several authors who

have laboured upon the Polyzoa, that I ignore their work. Although I

am pretty familiar with the various classifications which have been issued
since the publication of the ' Brit. Mus. Cat.' and the ' Crag Polyzoa,' many

of the modifications that have been suggested apply more particularly to
the Cheilostomata than to the Cyclostomata.

    In the former suborder there are many points of superficial structure

that would be naturally sought after by those whose desire it is to arrange

the various genera in a natural sequence, but iu the latter suborder there

is but little variety except in the arrangement of the cells. In the later

work of Mr. Busk,' in the writings of Professor Smitt, and in the

' Brit. Marine Polyzoa ' (1880) of the Rev. Thomas Hincks, practically

the original arrangement of the Cyclostomata is left untouched. In the

work of Mr. Hincks there is a redistribution of genera in a very limited

family arrangement ; but the work deals manifestly with recent species,

and with species found only in the British area.

In his Introduction to the Marine Polyzoa Mr. Hincks refers to the

studies of Professor Smitt in the following terms: 'He (Smitt) has

aimed at a genealogical classification, starting with the proposition that

the variations of species follow the line of their development and may be

in a great measure explained by it. The Polyzoa as compound animals

offer great facilities for the study of the laws and causes of variation.

The differentiation of the colony gives us a series of variations running

from the early and simple states to the fully developed form which is the

parallel of the series of differences amongst species. Thus the British

species of Crisia represent the evolutionary stages of one and the same

type, of which Smitt regards Grisia genicnlata, Mil.-Ed., as the first and

simplest. The forms of this genus he would arrange according to the

law of their evolution in a series, the members of which, springing from a

common origin, will hold each its evolutionary grade.'^ This, on the whole,

may be a sound working principle, though it may not be always appli-

cable when investigating the PalfBozoic Polyzoa. I have not the least

doubt but that some of the Graptolites aud some of the earliest types

of Polyzoa had a common ancestral origin. I believe also that the

uni- and multi-serial Sfomatopora represent evolutionary stages of a

more primitive type ; but we are not able to show at what stage diver,

gences or differentiation of the colony took place, for the simple reason

that the simple and the compound colonies occupy the same horizon in

the Lower Silurians of America. In this country we have only uniserial

WeStomatopora in the Wenlock Shales.  do not meet with multiserial

Stomatopora until we reach the Lias.

     One of the chief difficulties the systematist has to encounter in classi-

fying the Fossil Polyzoa is this : On what characters in the zoarium

shall divisions be based ? If every variation of the zoaria is to be

accepted, then there can be no limits set which shall be binding alike to

all Palaeontologists, for the zoaria of species vary greatly in different

--localities and in different countries. Then, again, if as the old workers
--have done we accept the fenestrule, its size, shape, or character, as an

element to guide ns in the structure of genera or species, we shall still

be at fault, for in very many of the Fevestella, both in this country and in

America, the fenestrule varies greatly, even iti the same zoarium. There

is, however, one element that may be safely relied on, and this I have

--chosen for my guidance that is, the structure and the arrangement of

the cells in the branch, or in the colony ; all other characters, structural
or superficial, are subordinate to this.

This principle has been adopted by Mr. Hincks in his arrangement of

Recent Polyzoa, and admirable results have followed. I shall not there-

fore be out of the pale of competent authority in thus seeking to extend

the principle to Fossil Polyzoa. Before closing these remarks, however,
I cannot help saying that to seek from the embryologist information that
would help to dispel the cloud of doubt that surrounds the earlier history
of the Palaeozoic Polyzoa seems to be somewhat fanciful. Yet, in the

latest researches of Dr. Jules Barrois on the Embryogeny of Cyclosto-
matous Polyzoa,' we are furnished with most important conclusions

respecting the ancient group, as a result of researches on living forms.

Barrois says : ' To conclude, we may put forward the hypothesis of the
very ancient existence of a group of Frohryozoa, composed of swimming

organisms, free, and possibly analogous to the Rotifera (at least as regards
the aspect and general arrangement of the body), and of which the few

larvae of Entoproda that we have nowadays represent the sole survivors
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

from this group the existing Bryozoa are derived by adaptation to a new
mode of life ; certain larvae have accustomed themselves to creep . . .
upon their oral surface instead' of swimming freely through the water ;
and hence the changes . . . which produce the Bryozoan form.'

A very cursory examination of the Synopsis of Primary Division of

the Polyzoa,^ formulated by Mr. Busk, will show that to a large extent

these are founded upon recent types. The orders include both fresh-

water and marine species, and being originally devised by Dr. Allman for

his classification of the Freshwater Polyzoa, the order Gymnolemata was

necessarily extended for the inclusion of the whole of the Marine Polyzoa

as well. The three suborders of Mr. Busk Cheilostomata, Cyclostomata,

--and Ofenostomata are founded upon certain peculiarities of the mouth of

the cell. In the first of these divisions the orifice, or mouth of the cell,

is subterminal and of less diameter than the area of the cell. In the

second the cell is tubular, and the orifice or mouth is terminal ; but as the

third suborder has characters unknown to me in a fossil state, it may be

conveniently dispensed with in this Report. The two divisions already

alluded to are made to include the whole of the Fossil Polyzoa of the

Crag, and also the whole of our Marine Polyzoa, British or foreign. At

present I have no knowledge of any genus or species found within the

European area at least, in either the Cainozoic or Mesozoic, that may not

be included in the suborders of Mr. Busk, if slightly modified to meet a

few rare cases. When, however, we get beyond the Mesozoic epoch, and

pass into the Palaeozoic, the cases are very difiPerent. It is here that we

meet with types evidently belonging to the class Polyzoa, in which the

cell is devoid of either terminal or subterminal stomata. In making a

superficial examination of these we find that the true or normal cell is

deeply set in the branch, stem, or frond, and what we see of the superficial

orifice is not the mouth of the cell, but what may be fittingly called the

vestibule                                           the true  orifice  is  concealed.  In many of the Palaeozoic types
                                                 ;

the vestibule is very large, and generally filled with matrix. The genera

--in which the concealed stomata may be casually observed for sections
--are required to show the distinct features are species of Ptilodietya, Area-

nopora, and Bhahdomeson. Besides the mere stomata there are certain

peculiarities of the grouping of the cells, and of the interspaces between

cell and cell, that would afibrd good diagnostic characters ; but of them-

myselves they are not of sufficient importance for                                     purpose. It is very

evident tliat types like these cannot be placed in existing suborders

without doing violence to the original and generally accepted diagnosis

of Busk, Smitt, and Hincks.

To prevent confusion and to meet the difficulty, I have founded

a new suborder, which, following the example of Mr. Busk, is framed

Wewith distinct reference to the cell-mouth.                         cannot afford to abandon

our hold upon the two divisions so familiar to students of Recent

Polyzoa ; but in a synopsis of recent and fossil species and genera it

is essential that every feature should be accurately described.

Since a joint paper of mine and Mr. Shrubsole's was read before the

Geological Society,' an abstract of which was printed in the Proceedings

of the Society, a valuable memoir of the American Palajozoic Bryozoa

has been published by E. 0. Ulrich * in the ' Journal of the Cincinnati

Society of Natural History.' In this contribution a new suborder is

proposed for the purpose of including groups some of which cannot

possibly, for reasons presently to be explained, be included in this Report

of Fossil Polyzoa. Mr. Ulrich says that his suborder Trepostomata ' is

proposed for the reception of the majority of the Palaeozoic and many of

the more recent Bryozoa. The principal distinguishing features are

(1) that the zoarium is composed of slender fasciculate tubes, which do not

(as in the case of the Cyclostomata) gradually enlarge as they approach,

the surface, but remain throughout nearly of the same diameter ; and

(2), that, at a certain point in the course of the tubes to the surface, they
bend outward more or less abruptly, and cJiange in character. Besides

the following Palfeozoic families, the Gerioporidce should be referred to

the Trepostomata.' 2

The Palaeozoic families included in this new suborder are Ptilo-

dictyonidce,  Zittel  emend.  Ulrich                                 StictoporidtB, Ulrich ;  Moniicullporidce,

Nicholson ; Fistuloporidce, Ulrich ; and Ceramoporidce, Ulrich. It is not

now with me a question of priority, but a question of fitness. Accepting

the diagnosis of Mr. Ulrich, which, for the things he includes in the new

suborder, is very good, I ask, who that knows anything of recent Bryo-

zoa or Polyzoa would be inclined to adopt the Monticuliporidce as defined

and limited by Professor Nicholson,'* or even by Mr. Ulrich, as Polyzoa ?
As to the Cerioporidce, if Busk's family is meant, only one genus in that

family, Stellipora, could be placed, provisionally, in the suborder as defined

by Mr. Ulrich. I have not the least wish to cast the slightest disparage-

ment upon this piece of really good work, but having been forced to

dissent from the classification of the Bryozoa of Mr. Ulrich, I will now
give my reasons for doing so.

In a former admirable Report published by the British Association,*

there is one entitled the ' Third Report on British Fossil Corals,' by

Professor Duncan. At p. 128 the author says : ' Jules Haime, when

investigating the Oolitic Polyzoa, classified forms without septa and
with tabulfe, like Chcetetes or Monticulipora, as Polyzoa, and the beautiful

Stellipone were especially included.

    ' Now the question arises, are there any recent Polyzoa, whose soft

parts have been examined, that have tabulae ? From our knowledge of

the recent Polyzoa, it is unsafe to answer this in the affirmative. There

is a fresh-water species which is said to have tabulte, but the assertion

requires confirmation. The classification, then, of these forms amongst
the Polyzoa ranst be deferred, and I propose to decide against it now.

   --' Bennmontui is distinguished by MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules

Haime as follows : " This genus is distinguished from all other Chaetetin^

by the formation of its tabulae, which ai'e irregular or vesicular, and it thus
resembles MiclieJenia, belonging to Favositi7ice." The presence of septa
belonging to three cycles is asserted by the same authors, and this fact
must remove the genus quite out of the neighbourhood of septaless foi'ms.

     'The genera of the Choetetinse were formerly Chcetetes, Monticulipora,
Dania, Stdlipura, JJekayio, Beaumoiitia, and Lahechia. It has been shown
that SteUipora, Dekayia, and Lahechia are subgenera of Monticulipora,
that Dania cannot be separated from Chcetetes, and that Beaumontia has
no correct affinity with the others, and that it belongs to another family.

     ' The genera should stand thus :

            Ch*tetin.S!.

Chcetetes.      Subgenus, Dania.

Monticidipora.  ,,        SteUipora.

                ,, DeJcayia.

                ,, Lahechia.

But the subgeneric names should be dropped.
     'This result is interesting because it eliminates Beaumontia, and

makes a compact series, the affinities of which are not Polyzoan, but

which may be Alcyonarian or Hydrozoan.'

     After the most careful study of species belonging to the several

genera mentioned, and even after the study of the later investigations of
Professor Lindstrom and Professor Nicholson, I cannot help but accept

tliis early decision of Professor Duncan. I am not sufficiently versed in

the necessary knowledge respecting the Actinozoa to assert anything
about the Alcyonarian nature of the Ghcvtetince. Professor Duncan
classifies the Alcyonaria, in the same Report, p. 135, thus : Cha;tetes,
Monticidipora, Dania, SteUipora, Lahechea, and he also gives a careful

resume of the opinions of Professor Agassiz (pp. 132-3) respecting the

Hydrozoan characteristics of the same group.
     There remains but little to add to the masterly way in which Pro-

fessor Duncan (previous to the grouping of the Monticuliporidfe by
Professor Nicholson) dealt with the question of the relationship which was
 supposed to exist between the Chcetetitice and the Polyzoa. Since that
time several attempts have been made to revive the classification of Jules
 Haime already referred to by Professor Duncan, and the genus Heteropora

has been often referred to as a probable link between the Polyzoa of the
 Mesozoic and the Chceteii71.ce of the Palaeozoic epochs. The Heteropora
 of the Oolites and of the Cretaceous I have carefully studied, but so far

as I am acquainted with this genus, even including those species of the
Crag, I cannot decide in favour of those who believe that there is a
remarkable affinity between the two groups. The Heteropora may well

puzzle the most painstaking of students, and a positive decision, either

one way or the other, is a difficult matter. Still I cannot help believing

that the species of this genus have nearer affinities with Polyzoa than

with either Chcetetes or Monticulipora.

one genus, Eridopora, some of the species of which closely resemble our

own Carboniferous Geramopora megastoma, M'Coy, and Mr. M'Coy's

184 REPORT-- 1883.

     In the Suborder Chellostomaia, fam. Membranoporidce, Busk, Mr.
Ulrich places one genus only, ? Palceschara, Hall, and he remarks (he.

Acit. p. 156) : ' few American Palaeozoic genera of Bryozoa have been

omitted from the above classification, because I have not yet been able
to give them the attention required for a full elucidation of their characters
and affinities.'

     Through the kindness of Mr. J. M. Nickles, of Cincinnati, I have been

furnished with specimens of a great many of the so-called Bryozoa of the

Cincinnati group, and the drawings and descriptions of Mr. Ulrich will

enable me to give details, and weave in genera in the classification of the

whole of our Fossil Polyzoa.
     For rather more elaborate details than I have been able to give in this

report I have very great pleasure in referring the reader to the first
chapter of ' The Genus Montlcnlipora,' ' entitled 'The General History of
the Genus,' and also Chapter III. for the statement of the views of Dr.
Lindstrom (extract from ' Ann. Nat. Hist.' ser. iv. vol. xviii. p. 5 et seq.),

and to Mr. Bnsk, 'Mr. A. W. Waters, and Prof. Nicholson on the genus

and species of Heteropora.

     In the above grouping I have taken the simplest type of cell with

which I am acquainted; and, as these genera are well represented in our
own Weulock Shales, which were evidently derived from an earlier series
of rocks, they may be taken to represent the earliest adherent types of

Trenton rocks, and are also abundant in the ' Cincinnati group ' of Ohio.

Bapalonaria, however, in our British Paleozoic rocks.

                           ASCODICTTOX, Nicholson and Eth. jun.

     The genus Ascodictyon was originally founded by the authors for
' anomalous types ' of fossils found in the Devonian rocks of America,

and in the Carboniferous Shales of Scotland. By my own investigations

I have been able to extend the range of some of the forms that were
originally placed under the genus, to the Wenlock Shales at least. Sub-
ject to future correction, I think I have sufficient evidence to prove that
Stomatopora dissimilis, Vine, is the mature form of Ascodictyon radici-
forme. Vine ; and because of this I associate this genus with the other two
to form the family Stomatoporidce.^

      I have previously drawn attention to Prohoscina (' Third Brit. Assoc.
Rep. on Foss. Polyzoa,' 1882), and, although some authors regard it as of
generic value, I think that it will be safer to allow the species that have
heretofore been placed as Prohoscina (fossil types at least) to fall under
Stomatopora. (For remarks on recent species see Hincks' ' Brit. Marine
Polyzoa,' vol. i. pp. 436-7). D'Orbigny's Filesparsa incrassata (' Pal. Fr.'
loc. cit. p. 817) is in all probability, says Mr. Hincks, the same as Smitt's
Stomatopora incrassata (' Brit. M. Poly.' p. 437).

     In any classification of Recent or Fossil Polyzoa, the grouping of
suitable genera under this family name will be always difficult, and

perhaps, to some, unsatisfactory. I have, however, followed very closely

Mr. Hincks, but working as I am upon fossil species, with a pretty full

knowledge of the recent, I have made a few alterations advisedly.
     The genus Diastoporella is the nearest approach to Mesozoic Diasto-

--pora that we have in the Pateozoic rocks. It is rare in the "Wenlock

Shales not so much so in the "Wenlock Limestone, but I have obtained
the best results from the study, of a fine specimen presented to me by
Professor Gustav Lindstrom, and upon this I found the present genus,

    ' In the Lower Silurian Series, America, there are many beautiful forms of

Stomatopora, and Proboscina range from these lower rocks upwards. See Ulrich,
Am. Pal. Bryozoa.

    In'^ Mr. Walford's cabinet there are still many undescribed species which, if
worked up, would increase the number and range.

    ^ It may be well, by way of preventing a misconception, to refer to the genus

Terebellaria. I cannot give it a place in the present classification, but having given

an account of the development of the species myin ' Third Brit. Assoc. Eep.' 1882,

I refer the student to that paper for further remarks.

·whicli will be referred to again farther on. In America, Mr. Ulrich's
Berenicea primitiva (^op. cit. p. 157, 'American Palseoz. Bryozoa''),

which he says is rare in the Cincinnati group, is much closer related to
Mesozoic Diastopora {Berenicea) than anything we have. The cells of

his B. vesiculosa, XJlrich, resemble some of the cells of Oolitic ' Mesenteri-
pora,' some of the species of which I do not place with the Cyclostomata

in this Report.

  -- --For the genus Diastopora adherent forms I take one of the species

of Lamouroux, and also one for the biserial species that may be safely

placed in the genus. For similar reasons, previously expressed by Mr.
Hincks {op. cit. p. 443), I accept Tubulipora, Lamk., and allow it to follow
in a natural sequence Diastopora ; species are partially adherent and

partly free. With regard to Entalophora it may be well to say a word.

Mr. Hincks allows the genus to follow Iclmonea, but I prefer that it should

follow Tuhdipora for the reason given by the author (p. 455), that in its
young state Entalophora ' consists of an adnate tubular crust.' There

--are, however, two types of this genus ranging from the Silurian rocks to

the present seas the Pustulopora type of Busk and the Spiropora type
and I have not as yet been abld to satisfy myself that the two had a

In 1849 Professor King established this family for a very peculiar

group of Palaeozoic Polyzoa. ' Considering FenesteUa as the type of the

family, it is proposed,' says the author, ' to include in it all those reticu-

lated genera agreeing -with this genus in having the cellules planted on

a basal plate composed of vertical capillary tubes, as first discovered by

Mr. Lonsdale. Besides FenesteUa this family embraces the Ptilopora

and PoJypora of M'Coy ; also the genera Sijnocladia and PhyUopora.' ^
    It is very evident that if we relied upon the above diagnosis it would

be impossible to accept King's family name for the restricted group

which I have placed under this head. As FenesteUa was taken by Pro-

fessor King as the type, I prefer to use the name, and restrict the group

to those species only in which the cells are arranged biserially in the

branch.

The genus FenesteUa has been so ably handled by Mr. Gr. W. Shrub-

sole,^ and so recently, that I think it needless to enter upon any lengthy

description here. Accepting Mr. Shrubsole's work, I will now give

reasons for allowing this family to follow that of the Tuhuliporidce.

If we take any ordinary FenesteUa, such as F. pleheia, M'Coy, we

shall find that the branches bear two rows of cells, separated, apparently,

Aby a median keel.  vertical section of the branch shows that the cells

are arranged in a line, but that the proximal part of the cell is depressed,

Athe distal portion rising upwards to the surface of the branch.

transverse section shows that the cells are alternately placed, that the

keel is obliterated, and that the cells themselves are foraminated very

similarly to the cells of recent Crisia, Stomatopora, or Tubulipora. There

are also minute structures in these ancient cells, very similar to minute

structures in recent species of Cyclostomatous Polyzoa. The capUlary

tubes referred to by Mr. Lonsdale are also a peculiar feature in the

--zoarium of FenesteUa that is, if I understand his reference aright

and are totally unlike any of the minute structures in Betepora, where,

as Mr. Lonsdale says, ' capillary tubes are wanting.' In Mr. Busk's

--' Cyclostomata ' (p. 20), the following reference is made, for classifica-

tory purposes, to FenesteUa : ' Herr Kirchenpaur's genus Eetihornera
would, from his description, include some Escharidan or Cheilostomatous

forms approaching Retcporoi                                                                                                           but among them  his -B.  dentata and plicata

appear without doubt to be Cyclostomatous, and I have therefore ventured
to appropriate his expressive appellation for the fenestrate forms of
Hornera ; not regarding it, however, as impossible that the fossil genus

Fenestella may have a prior claim after all.'

     Through the kindness of Miss Gatty I have been allowed to examine
her collection of Polyzoa, amongst which is a beautiful specimen of

B. foliacea, McGillivray. If this species may be taken as the type of
Betihornera, none of the species of Fenestella known to me could be, even
provisionally, associated with it. In some of the branches we have a

triple and even a quadruple set of pores, and only in some rare cases are

pores biserial in their arrangement. It may happen, however, when I
come to treat of Tertiary fenestrate B^0)-7ie)-a, that these may be associated

with the more ancient PJiyllo'pora in the family Polyporidce ; but even

then I think that the group or groups should be kept distinct.

     Mr. Shrubsole ' has already pointed out the differences in the external
characters of Silurian and Carboniferous Fenestellce. It only remains for

me to show that the structural differences are very slight indeed. The

cells in all Fenestellce are arranged bi-serially, and between the cells there

are very delicate interspaces, the walls of the cells in the opposite sides

of the branches being separate and distinct. Yet by means of this inter-

space the whole of the cells of the colony appear to be linked together.

Have we here the passages through which the endosarc passed from cell

to cell ? If so, then the unity of the cells in the colony, and also the

distinct surroundings of the cell by its own wall, and the purpose of the

interspace, are easily explained

      In Ptilopora, M'Coy, the arrangement of the cells is very similar to
that of Fenestella, but it is difficult to obtain specimens for making sections.
I purposely keep the genus distinct, subject of course to future correc-
tion on account of its peculiar zoarial characters. Mr. Ulrich includes
in his family Fenestellido} the following genera :

Fenestella, Lonsdale.  Areliimedia, Lesueur.
Polypora, M'Coy.
Septopora, Prout.      Lyropora, Hall.
Fenestralia ,,

     I have been compelled to found a new genus for Carboniferous species

formerly included in Glauconome, Goldfuss. I should, however, have

--preferred to adopt the old names of King Acanthocladia, or Pennirete-

pora, D'Orb. but neither of these genera conveys a just idea of the species
which have been discovered since these names were formulated. Acantho-
cladia is a Permian fossil of the family Thamniscidce, and the type of the
wenus, A. anceps, Schlotheim, has ' rows of cellules from three to six
on the stems ' (op. cit. p. 48), and the type of D'Orbigny's Penniretepora

is Glauconome disticha, Lonsdale.

indicate the place that the family should occnpy in this classification. I

have made a careful analysis of the generic and specific characters of the
whole of the carboniferous group of Polyzoa that may ultimately find a

fitting resting-place here. In 1873, Mr. Robert Etheridge, jun., described

a 'peculiar polyzoon,' under the name of Synodadia carhonaria, R. Eth.

jun., taking King's genus for the placement of the species. Ultimately,

in the descriptive part of ' Explanation of Sheet 23,' ^ p. 102, Mr.

Etheridge places the Scotch specimen as a variety only of Synodadia

character of Septopora, nor in the species which he places in the genus,

says anything about  supplementary pores                                                                                yet,  in  comparing  specimens

of Mr. Etheridge's Synodadia carbonaria with the beautiful figures of

Prout, it appears to me that the ' medallion face,' with its irregular lines

of pores on the dissepiments, only represents the full features now known

to exist in carboniferous species (supplementary pores) which were only

known as ' gemmuliferous vesicles ' when King described his Permian

Synodadia. If, therefore, some of my American friends can examine

Prout's species, or fragments of the same, this matter may be set at rest,.

and in all probability the Scotch Carboniferous Synodadia (?), already

described by Mr. Etheridge and Mr. John Young, may be placed here.

Waiting, therefore, further investigations, I will place, temporarily at

least, the species at present known to exist in our British rocks.

    Whatever generic name the above species may bear in the future, I

do not think they can be more fittingly placed than in the present
family. There is, however, an element of doubt in the adoption of
Septopora, and, but that the Messrs. Young have associated the name
Diplopora with an altogether different species, I would suggest that
Septopora should be replaced by Diplopora.

    There are two or three more sjjecies that may be placed in the

of Polyzoa, it would, perhaps, be unwise to fix any particular types for

these genera.

     These two genera differ in the anastomosis of the branches, but in
the arrangement of the cells in the branch there is a striking similarity
between them. The Fenestella intermedia, Shrubsole, of the Silurian
rocks, appears to be a kind of connecting link between the two groups,
Fenestellidaj and Polyporidee. The F. intermedia occurs in the Niagara

rocks at Lockport, as well as in our own Wenlock series. The branches
are occupied alternately by two and by three rows of cells, so that it is

ratber a difficult matter to decide to which family group it should be

referred.

In a recent paper on Phyllopora (' Quart. Journ. Geo. Soc' vol. xxxviii.

p. 347) Mr. Shrubsole says that from the Devonian rocks (Palaeozoic

Foss.) Phillips figures the Phyllopora with circular fenestras as Betepora

prisca ; that with lozenge-shaped fenestras as Fenestella anthritica, and that
with square fenestrse as Gorgonia ripisteria. As might be expected, there is

considerable confusion of species in Phillips's delineation of the Devonian

Polyzoa ; two or more varieties are included under one head {op. cit.

p. SS-l). This is to be regretted, but, as Mr. Shrubsole says, it is almost

impossible to make a revision of Devonian Polyzoa on account of the

Wedifficulty of obtaining material for the purpose.  are indebted to

Professor Nicholson for much valuable information in his descriptions of

These genera, which have heretofore been loosely defined and as

loosely accepted by some Palaeontologists, are now restricted. The genus

Tliamniscus was founded by Professor King, and though he did not read

aright all the characters which his specimens afforded for a complete study,

still he gave a good general estimate of its varied features. Professor

King says (' Perm. Foss.' p. 44) : 'I formerly placed the type of this

genus in  Lamouroux's  Eornera                                                       but  it  is  evident     from  Mr.  Lonsdale's

--observations that this was an erroneous collocation.' The type Tliam-

niscus duhius, Schlotheim is very well described by King, and also well

figured, but it was not possible, at the time he wrote, to clear up satisfac-

torily all the points raised by him. In the text, and also in the figures

(pi. V. fig. 10), Professor King indicates that Tliamniscus simulates the

character of  Synocladia                                                   this was  clearly an   error,  as  has  been  pointed  out

Of the other genus I may say that the typical Acanthocladia, King, and

IchthyoracMs, M'Coy, appear to cover the same ground ; but it is impossible

to include in the genus species so difi'erent in their structural characters as

Glauconome pluma, PhilL, and G. hipinnata, Phill. I accept the dia-

gnosis of Acanthocladia anceps, Schlot., and take it as the generic type.

    I have already pointed out the peculiarities of this suborder when

speaking of the one proposed by Mr. XJlrich. It will be well, therefore,
to deal very fully with the genera and species that I propose to assign to

this division of Palaeozoic Polyzoa.

     Mr. Ulrich in his classification of ' American Palajozoic Bryozoa ^ {op,
cit. p. 151) proposes two family names for the grouping of species which
have heretofore been loosely placed in one group only. The first is the

Ulrich.

      In the first of these families Mr. Ulrich places the following genera :

            1. Ftilodidija, Lonsdale.                                                      3. Arthropora, Ulrich.

                       5. Clathropora, Hall.

     As Ftilodidija, Lonsdale, is taken as the type of this family, I shall
make no apology for working out the stractnral chai-acters of one, at
least, of the forms upon which Lonsdale founded his genus.

     Notes on the Polyzoa of the Wenlock Shales, &c., ' Quart. Jour. Geo.
Soc' Feb. 1882 ; Second Brit. Assoc. Report on Foss. Polyzoa, mihi, 1881,
for information on the genus generally.

     I have already described, under the name Ptilodidi/a Lonsdalei,
some of the ' young specimens ' referred to by Lonsdale. In that descrip-

tion I spoke of certain peculiar structures in the species (p. 66) with a
promise that ' I should retui'n to their discussion at some future time

when other investigations were completed.' I now redeem the promise,

in the hope that other Palaeontologists will examine the species in their

own localities, and compare them with these type specimens of Lonsdale.

     I. Superficial characters of Ftilodidija Lonsdalei, Vine. If we take
a number of the fragments of this species, which we shall find rather
abundantly distributed in the Wenlock Shales, and submit them to a
tolerable heat in the fire, plunging them immediately aftef into water, we

shall soon getrid of the ' crust,' and some peculiar structures will be revealed.
The ' small quadrangular cells ' referred to by Lonsdale will be seen to
perfection, and according as the preservation of the zoarium is cal-
careous or ferruginous, tlie walls will be either of a white or of a dark
brown colour. The rows of cells in a longitudinal direction are separated
by dividing ridges, or by slightly raised ridges also referred to by
198 EEPOET 1883,

Lonsdale, narrow and compact in the central portion of the zoarium,
rather wider and widely separated as the margin is reached. Within the

' ridges ' or ' bars,' longitudinally, the cells are separated from each other

by much thinner walls, and the apparently quadrangular character is now-

seen to be oval, but two oval cells touching each other at their proximal
and distal extremities leave small angular spaces at the base, laterally, of
each cell, p. 198, fig. 2, No. 4. This angular portion is perforated, con-
sequently each oval cell orifice is seen to be surrounded by four perforated
angular spaces, or, in other words, the ' quadrangular cells ' are really

oval orifices in outline, with the angular corners perforated ; and rows
of these are separated by the raised ridges already referred to.

AII. Zoarium in section.           transverse section of the zoarium will show

Weother points of structure referred to briefly by Lonsdale (p. 198, ficr. 2,
No. 2).     now find that the zoarium is raised in the middle, thinning out

wedge-like towards the margins. In the centre the cells are perpendicular

on each side of, what it will be convenient to call, the axial region. The

cells on the right and left of the middle cells are slightly bent towards

the right and left borders, and the angle of this bending of the cell

decreases as the margin is approached. This shows the cause of that

obliquity in the direction of the cells on either side of the central row,

noticed by Lonsdale in the diagnosis of the genus Ptilodictya. He also

observes that the ' cells penetrate the coral obliquely.' Superficially ex-

amined this appears to be the fact, but the extreme outer portion of the

surrounding ' cell ' orifice is not the true orifice of the cell ; it is only the

vestibule'(p. 198, fig. 2, No. 2, h). The true orifice is deeper down, and the

area of the cell is comparatively small (ibid, a) when compared with the

area of the vestibule. This will be better seen when I describe the longi-

tudinal section. If a tangential section of Ptilodictya is made, we find

crossing each area a bar, and at first sight this seems to be the homologue

of the ' tabute ' referred to by Professor Nicholson in his diagnosis of

Eeterodidya. They are not ' tabulse ' in P. Lonsdalei, but they°are sec-

tions of the cells which are reached at different depths, and they look,

especially in transparent sections, very much like tabulte.

III. Longitudinal sections. These I have made and studied very

mycarefully, and some of  sections reach the cells at different depths. If

the student will refer to fig. 2, No. 3, p. 198, a good general idea of the cell

and vestibule may be obtained. In this drawing I have given the outline

of ten cells (drawn from an opaque section), five on each side of the axial

region, but the axis as shown in the drawing is never found so sharp in

section as it appears to be in the figure. Here the cells are angular and

sub-opposite, so that two cells are almost triangular ; the base of the

triangle is the true orifices, and the apex is the proximal extremities of

the cells, and the spaces left vacant, on either side, at the distal portion

of the cells are the vestibules.^

     IV. The vestibules. In the transverse section (p. 198, fig. 2, No. 2) of
the zoarium of Ptilodictya, in fig. 25, 1 have shaded the vestibules, while the

cells are left white. The bars which separate the rows of cells are more
deeply shaded, and when viewed in this aspect they appear to be club-
hke, decreasing in thickness as their extremities reach the cell. In some

my· In thus alluding to the triangular character of the two cells, the student will

respects tbese ' clab-Iike ' partitions resemble tbe ' spiniform ' processes

described as ' Spiniform Corallites ' ' by Professor Nicbolson, but they have
nothing of the chai'actcr, as will be presently seen, of corallite structure.

On the surfaces of the zoarium and in the transverse sections these bars are

prominent characteristics of the Ptilodlctya of the Wenlock series of rocks

at least, and, in a modified form, the bars in the Sulcoretepora of the
Carboniferous rocks closely resemble them, but in none of tbe sections of

the Montkuliportdoi given by Nicholson, or made by myself, are there
any structures with which I can compare them. They appear to me to
be unique both in character and function neither do they resemble any

minute fossils, which he named Cralertjwra. In his paper on ' American

Palseozoic Bryozoa' (op. cit. p. 151) Mr. Ulrich refers to Craterijjora as
being the ' attached bases of Ftilodictyonidce.' These Crateripora form
expansions upon foreign bodies, in the centres of which are small cup-like
·depressions. They are, as Mr. Ulrich says, the bases or rootlike por-

tions of Ptilodictya, and though not common in the Wenlock Shales, I
l:ave several of them in my possession. Sometimes they are found upon

corals, sometimes upon the zoarium of Ptilodictya itself; they are small
disks, and at this early stage they have none of the after-characters of

two  and  a  half lines the                                                                       normal  character of the  zoarium  is  reached

and at this stage I give details of structure which repeats itself in the

after-development of i\ie zoarium (p. 200, fig. 3, No. 1). The breadth at
this particular point varies from about Jj to ^'^ of an inch.

     At a very early stage in the development two cells form the central

division of the zoarium, and from these lateral cells, obliquely on opposite

sides, are thrown oflP, and beyond these there is what I will call, for the

want of a better term, the virgin margin : that is a margin partaking of

the same virgin substance which forms the base and early basal develop-

ment. At this stage there are only two, and then four cells, near to

and just above the base. Because of the heterogeneous character of the

specimens, it is impossible to make out how or in what manner the cells

are developed ; consequently I have to resort to other transparent

specimens for this information, and, to make my meaning more clear to

the student of recent Polyzoa, I will describe briefly the process of de-

velopment of the cells in the common Crisia, which can be easily verified

by observation. Immediately above the flexible joint in Crisia denticulata,^

there are two cells, which expand in a right and left hand direction,

which form the base of the branch, and within the angle formed by and

near to the base of these cells the two immediately above originate, and

so on throughout the whole development of the branch, a new flexible

joint originating in a kind of bastard cell, laterally or from the centre.

In C. cornuta a delicate ca3nicium is seen to cover the lines of cells, and

within this dermal covering the cells of this species originate. In the

younger portions of the zoarium of Ptilodictya, that is towards the margins,

the bars already referred to are not solid (p. 200, fig. 3, No. 2, c c) until

after a certain stage is passed. Here we find that the new cell originates

within the bar, a portion of the previously formed bar which is a kind of

dermal covering                                                                          and  as  other  cells are developed towards the  margin,
                                                                                      ;

the bars, or rather walls, of the cells on the inner or more central portion

of the zoarium become solidified. There are no bars on the outer portion

of the zoarium.

     VI. The ' laminar axis ' of Ptilodictya. In all my palteontological

labours I have been extremely anxious to do justice to previous authors,

and I have never, so far as I am aware, either in these reports or in my

other writings, taken advantage of other people's work without acknow-

ledging its source. At times this desire to bow to authority has led me

myinto error, which it may be well now to refer to. In                                                                      second ' Brit.

M'Coy's diagnosis of the genus Ptilodictya instead of that of Lonsdale.

In M'Coy's definition he refers to species having ' a thin, laminar,

flattened, concentrically wrinkled central axis.' In consequence of

this I referred to the ' axis ' always when speaking of Ptilodictya, and

in speaking of Sulcoretepora (B.A. Rep. 1880) I fell into an error

with regard to the axial region. This was poiuted out to me by Mr.

John Young, but I have had no opportunity of correcting it until now,

and reference has been made to the error when writing of Sulcoretepora.

     ' See figures iu either Busk's Cyolostomata or Hmcks's Brit. Mar. Polyzoa.
202 EEPORT--1883.

In spite, however, of all that has been written about this ' laminar axis ""

in Polyzoa, I have always had my doubts about its existence, and I did

not care to venture into the domain of mere disputation imtil I could

give some tangible proof that my views were correct. I ventured to
touch upon the question in my paper on the ' Wenlock Polyzoa.' In

that paper I wrote (oj;. cit. p. 66), when speaking of Ptilodidya

LonsdaleifYine : ' I refuse to say cells "separated by a thin laminar axis,"

because this is not so in this species at least. The " axis," if such it may

be called, is formed by the bases of the cells, both in transverse and in

longitudinal sections.' After giving the views of Mr. John Young of

Glasgow, and also recording my own observations on the specimens in

the School of Mines, and the observations of Prof. Nicholson, I pass on
to say : ' This being a matter of extreme importance, I shall return to its

discussion at some future time when other investigations which I am

making are completed.' ^ I cannot say whether or not Mr. Ulrich has
seen the above remarks. If he has not, I must then take his testimony as
independent, but in October 1882,2 when criticising remarks made by

Prof. Nicholson (' Monticulipora,' p. 196, 1881), Mr. Ulrich says : ' If I
understand him (Nicholson) correctly, he believes that the axis is con-

stituted by a definite structure from which the two layers of cells may be
stripped. This impression is manifestly erroneous, nor do I know of a
single double-leaved Bryozoon in which such a structure may be demon-
strated. In Ptilodictija the facts are simply that we have two layers of

cells which are grown together back to back by the adhesion of the
epithecal lamina3 of each layer.' So far the observations of Mr. Ulrich

agree with my own, but because of this I am not prepared to accept the

further view that Monoirypa pavonia, D'Orb. (' Monticulipora,' p. 195), is a
Ptilodidya (' American Pal. Bryozoa,' pp. 163-4).^ It is very evident that
our Silurian rocks are remarkably poor in species of Ptilodictya, and it

gives me great pleasure to acknowledge the varied labours of Mr. Ulrich

and Mr. J. M. Nickles in working out what they prefer to call

' Bryozoa.'

     VII. The endosarcal passages. If we are to accept the views of the
leading writers on the development of Polyzoa, then some little attention
should be given to what I venture to call ' endosarcal passages ' in the
zoarium of fossil species. Whenever we examine with a high power the
supposed contiguity of the cells, we generally find between the ' epitheca '

of cell and cell very delicate hollow spaces. In longitudinal sections of
Ptilodictya the hollow spaces intervene all along the so-called ' laminar
axis,' and the alternate cells at their bases appear to open into this tube-
like hollow. In Fenestella, and also in various species of ' Pinnatopora,'
 I have detected similar hollows. In the Oraptolites the ' cellules ' of
certain species open into what is called the ' canal,' a space intervening
between the ' solid axis ' and the cellules, through which the ' organic
pulp passed into the cells.' 1 have not the least doubt but that through
 these passages in the ancient zoaria of the Polyzoa the endosarc passed

from cell to cell. It is not in every section that I have made that I have
 been able to detect the passages ; still they are found in some, and I have

      ' Eead Dec. 1881. Pub. Quar.Jour. Geo. Soc. Feb. 1882.
      - American Palceozoic Srijozoa, p. 164.
      ^ I have a specimen of Mmwtrypa 2}«'V07iia, D'Orb., from the Cincinnati beds,

no doubt bnt that other workers will find them if the sections are care-
fully prepared. At the bases of some cells I have also detected circular

openings, and as this would be the probable position of the funiculus of

the polypide, this seems to me to be additional proof of the view I take.

I have never been able to detect in any fossil specimens ordinary
' rosettenplaten ' (communication pores, Hincks) other than the above, and

I am unable to furnish better details than the one already given ; neither
have I been able to detect in any of my numerous sections ' connecting

foramina ' similar to, or in any way analogous with, the structure of the
cell wall in PtilocUctya maculata, Ulrich, figured in the ' Am. Palseozoio

Bryozoa,' pi. VI. fig. 17.

     VIII. The tabulaj. I have already said that I have not been able to
detect ' tabulas ' in any well-accredited species of Fossil Polyzoa. In

Ptilodicttja figured by me now, I have allowed a structure to appear which
may be mistaken for tabute, but I think this would be an erroneous

interpretation. I refer to the subject because Professor Nicholson
describes tabulae in Heterodictya, and Mr. Ulrich refers to ' diaphragms '
in some of the ' robust cells ' of species of the genus. I have no desire to
enter into controversy with other authors, but I hope that Professor

Nicholson and also Mr. Ulrich will pardon me for making the following

remarks on theii' labours. In ' The Genus Monticulipora,'' p. 89, Professor
Nicholson furnishes particulars of Heterodictya gigantea, Nich., and he
gives figures of minute structures of the type. In the sections tabulte
are figured, and the walls are of a very peculiar character. This species,
and in fact many of the American Ftilodidya, difier from the type already

described.

     Mr. Ulrich (op. cit. p. 162) accepts the genus Ftilodidya, Lonsdale, in
which he includes Heterodidya, Nicholson (' Geo. Mag.' 1875), but the

characters which he gives as a diagnosis are not those of Lonsdale. I am
obliged therefore to fall back very reluctantly upon my own labours,,
which have now been carried on for a series of years ; and accepting

Ftilodidya Lonsdalei as the type, I found the following family for the

inclusion of a certain number of Pateozoic Polyzoa.

Family Aecanopoeid^, Mihi.

     Zoarium multiform. Zocecia tubular, or semitubular, orifice of cell
obscured by vestibule ; true orifice of cell unknown.

Genus Ftilodidya, Lonsd.  Type F. Lonsdalei, Vine.

   ,, Arcano2yora, Vine.     ,, Flustra ? parallela, Phill.
   ,, Glauconome, Goldf.    ,, O. disticha, Goldf.

                                             Ptilodictta, Lonsdale.

     Diagnosis of the genus already given.

    At present a revision of Ftilodidya seems to be impossible, but I may

just indicate that the foundiDg of two family names by Mr. Ulrich,.
Ftilodidyonidce and Stidoporidce, appears to be warranted by the peculiar ·
character of the cell orifice, as well as by the cell arrangement. The
only American species that comes nearest to P. Lonsdalei, Vine, is some ·

specimens of Bhinodidya granulosa, James, supplied to me by Mr. J. M..

Nickles. These, however, differ from the species E. granulosa, James^.

embedded in Limestone, -which Mr. Nickles has also sent me. This
appears to be tbe species which Mr. Ulrich renames R. NicJiolsoni, Ulrich.
Under present circumstances I can only catalogue the following British

species :

      Wenlock Shales  Ptilodldija Lonsdalei, Vine.

      ,, Limestone ,,  Icmceolata, Lonsdale.

     Mr. J. M. Nickles has also pointed out to me that the species which I

have calledP.wi/erporosff, Vine (Wenlock Polyzoa, 'Quart. J. G. Soc' p. 67),
is not a Ptilodicfya at all, but that it closely resembles Stictoporella

flexuosa, James. It certainly very closely resembles the delicate species
of James, but it differs considerably from Mr. Ulrich's S. interstruda. I

shall therefore adopt the generic, and retain my own specific name.

Wenlock Shales.       Stictoporella interporosa, Vine (:=Ptilodictya

             ?j ))                                                                      [interporosa).

     There still remains P. scalpellum (Eschara), Lonsdale, which for the
present must remain in abeyance. This also is not a Ptilodidija.

                                 Arcanopora, Vine.

Zoarium ?         . Zocecia arranged in parallel lines on opposite sides

·of tbe zoarium.

Sulcoretepora was founded by D'Orbigny in 1847, and since then a

variety of species of very different characters have been included in the

genus. Professor Morris, in his ' Catalogue of Brit. Fossils,' places the

genus in his family Reteporidce, a Gheilostomalous type, and it is un-

certain how authors regard the character of the species placed in it.

In the ' Catalogue,' Professor Morris includes the Flustra parallela of

Phill., and the Vincidaria raricosta, M'Coy. As the definition given by

--D'Orbigny is evidently inapplicable to these species ' Cells in series in
--furrows on one side cf simple depressed branches ' the name ought to

be dropped. At present I can only direct attention to the species already
named, to which the Messrs. Young have added another Sulcordepora

Moherisoni, Y. and Y. I have not yet completed my investigations, but I
have sufficient evidence to induce me to include the first two species in

the present group.

                                Glauconome, Goldfnss, restricted.

     ' Stem stony, thiu, elongated oval, branched, cells disposed longi-
tudinally, and alternately in rows over one half the surface, the other half
striated longitudinally. Nature of the covering and opening of the cells

     The above is Lonsdale's description of this restricted genus, and as
the type of Goldfuss and Lonsdale is the same species 0. disticlia,

--Goldf. it seems to me desirable that both the genus and species shonld

be limited to the type, unless the earlier Bala species can be included in
the same genus. It is very evident that the structural characters of the
Carboniferous species that have heretofore been included in the genus are

Although the Messrs. Young have written two papers on Blmhdome-

son species, they have not, so far as I am aware, given other than brief

descriptions of the genus. In their first paper (' Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.'

May, 1S7-4), after reviewing the history of Ceriopora, they saj'- : ' The

essential character of the fossil we are about to describe (Millepora gracilis,

Phill.)  separates  it  from  all  known  Carboniferous  forms                               we would

     In describing one of these figures the authors speak of the ' vestibules '
of the cells being filled with matrix. I have satisfied myself by sections

that these vestibules really exist in species, and I give below the two

206 REPORT-- 1883.

In this family, Mr. Ulrich places two genera, one of which he calls

Artlironema, Ulrich, which from the figures and description appears to be

a true Polyzoon. The other genus is Arfhroclema, Billings. In this

genus the segments are cylindrical, with cell apertures opening on all

sides. There are species in the "Wenlock Shales closely related to, if not

identical with, the American forms, but I have no evidence of the further

character given by ]\Ir. Ulrich : ' Zoarium composed of numerous seg-

ments .... pointed more or less obtusely at both ends.'

There is another species of a genus Auxano'pora, Nickles MS.

not yet published details of the type, I am not at liberty to refer to it

themselves, for the whole of the Ceriopora of the Silurian Rocks may be

conveniently reworked.

Silurian and Carboniferous forms may ultimately be placed. They are

Professor P. Martin Duncan, F.R.S., and also to Dr. H. C. Sorby, F.R.S.,

these reports, my thanks are also due for the extremely kindly manner

in which they have given advice, and help by way of suggestion, when-

ever solicited for the same. The General Committee of the British

Association must also be remembered by me on account of their kindly

consideration of ray humble efforts, and for their pecuniary help.

The Secretarj- regrets the unavoidable delay which has occurred in sup-

plying this report, which should have been presented at the last year's

meeting of the Association. He has lately had an opportunity of"

pursuing his researches on the Tertiary Flora of the North of Ireland,
and has been enabled to obtain some additional information as to tbe rela-
tion of these deposits with that of other portions of the British Islands.

     Most important amongst these fossil plants is a second example of a
fossil fern, which he believes to be identical with Lastrea Stiriaca (linger).

    ' I shall be sorry if such is the case, but I may have overlooked some papers on

Palaeozoic and Mcsozoic Polyzoa. If so, I hope authors wiU communicate with me.

210 REPORT-- 1883.

This specimen, wliicli is figured on the plate accompanying this report,

is in the collection of the Rev. Canon Grainger, D.D., Rector of Brough-
shane, who has aided considerably in these investigations. It is a

portion of a pinnule, with about eight alternating leaflets on each side,

on which the midrib and nerves are strongly marked, and not forked,

except at their apex.

With reference to this fern. Dr. Oswald Heer, in his description of

the fossil flora of Bovey Tracey, Devonshire,' in alluding to the

' Miocene ' formation of Bovey, says : ' Of fifty species of plants found

in the lignite beds of Bovey twenty-one occur also on the Continent in

the Miocene formation. The lignite of Bovey Tracey is, therefore, un-

doubtedly Miocene ; and it is worthy of special remark that the species of

Cinnamonium which are so characteristic of the Miocene, and so gene-
rally distributed through it, make their appearance in Bovey precisely

as in the lignites and molasse of the rest of Europe ; equally characteristic

is the Lastrea Stiriaca, the fern of most universal distribution over

Miocene Europe.'

The importance of the discovery of this fern in the ironstone deposits

of the North of Ireland cannot therefore be overrated after this expres-

sion of oi^inion as to its value in determining the age of the strata in

which it is found, on the authority of so eminent a fossil botanist as that

of Professor Heer.

Mr. J. Starkie Gardner, F.G.S., who has been for some time studying

the Conifers, and lately visited this country for the purpose of examining

these collections, has very kindly furnished me with a few notes on them.
He thinks (as far as his observations lead him at present) there is but one

or two species of jjine ;  ' cones  of      Thuya (Cupressinse) abound                                                                                                                                 cones of
                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

Sequoia are rarer ; Goniferce outnumber leafy trees by at least twenty and

possibly one hundred fragments to one ; Magnolia fruits are as about one

to five against pine cones.' He also states that ' he has seen (in these

collections) several specimens of Nelumbium (a water-lily) ; ' all these
names, as he obaerves, must at present be taken as provisional, except

Pinus. ' There are two other conifers, both specimens unique, and both

Greenland forms.'

The Rev. Dr. Grainger was also fortunate enough to obtain a portion

of a fossil fish, which was found in a drift boulder of red or ochrey

marl (resembling that of some of the deposits at Ballypalady), at Culley-

backey, near Ballymena. It consisted of twelve or more vertebra3, with

their processes, above which are bones of the dorsal fin, and may have be-

longed to a fresh-water fish of the Percid^, such as the genus Lates.

This fossil is of considerable interest, as no remains of Vertebrata have,

so far as we are aware, hitherto been found in British strata of this age.

ON THE EARTHQUAKE PHENOMENA OF JAPAN.                              2ll

Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr. E. Etheridge, Mr.

   Thomas Gray, and Professor John Milne {Secretary), appointed
  for the jncrpose of investigating the Earthquake Phenomena

   of Japan.

·Owing to my absence from Japan, on a visit to Europe, during six

months of the past year, and a complication of circumstances involving

the removal of my seismological laboratory, over which I had no control,

the work accomplished in actual observation has been small.
     While passing through America, and subsequently when in Italy, I

saw and learnt mnch respecting observations which may with advantage

be amplified and repeated in Japan.

     When in England, I entered, in conjunction with Mr. Thomas Gray,

into arrangements with Mr. James Wliite, of Glasgow, for the construction
of a seismometer. This instrument, which gives a complete diagram of
all the sensible vibrations of an earthquake in conjunction with the time
of occurrence of these vibrations, was exhibited before the Geological
Society of London, and is described in their ' Proceedings.' '

     The instrument is now in Japan. By request it has been exhibited to

His Imperial Majesty, the Mikado of that country, and very shortly it will

be erected, in all probability, at the Meteorological Observatory in Tokio.

     One class of phenomena which I have been engaged in observing

since my return to Japan, is earth-tremors. These microseismic move-

ments of the soil I observed some years ago, with an instrument similar
in principle to the apparatus used by Messrs. Geoi'ge and Horace
Darwin, at the Cavendish Laboratory, when engaged in the attempt to
measure the lunar disturbance of gravity.

     The apparatus that I have employed during the last five months is
similar to the Tromometer of Bertelli and Rossi. It consists of a weight
suspended by a very fine wire, the whole being enclosed in a tube, for
protection against currents of air. Projecting downwards from the
weight there is a stile, which is observed with a microscope containing a
micrometer scale. The whole, which is supported on an iron stand, rests
on the head of a stone column. The column is about ten years old. It
is inside a brick building, from the walls and floors of which it is com-

pletely detached.

     Hitherto I have not had the time which is necessary to analyse the
mass of observations which have already been accumulated, but the

following points are very clear.

     1. It is but seldom, if ever, that the pendulum is completely at rest.

    A2. vertical motion is occasionally observed in the pendulum, the

stile of which oscillates up and down with a rapid tremulous movement.
     3. At times the horizontal swing of the pendulum is very irregular,

the oscillations being performed in short jerky swings which vary in

amplitude.

     4. With sudden changes in the barometer, the motions of the pendulum

are relatively very great.

     5. The pendulum does not always oscillate or hang over the same
point. There is a change in the vertical.

     These results are similar to results obtained by Bertelli, Rossi, and

other observers in Italy.

21 2 REPORT-- 1883.

     The cause of these movements is unknowD. Rossi makes the suffffes-
tlon that they may be due to a variation in volcanic activity beneath the

surface of the ground, whicli increases with a barometrical depression.

They may, however, be attributed to a complexity of causes acting on

the surface of our earth. At the time of a high wind the movements of

houses and trees may set the surface of a considerable area into a state of

tremor. When they are observed without a wind they may occasionally

be due to an irregularity in the increase or decrease in atmospheric

pressure. In a typhoon I have observed the needle of a.n ordinary aneroid

to move backward and forward through a range of from -jJ^ to ly^ of
an inch. This motion was irregular, having a period of from one to ten

seconds. Small but rajjidly succeeding variations in atmospheric pres-

sure, even very much smaller than those just quoted, indicate that the

surface of the ground is being subjected to and relieved from stresses, in

every probability, comjietent to produce the oscillations observed in the

pendulum.

   A second set of observations has been recording the motions of the

bubbles of two delicate levels placed beneath glass covers on the same

column with the tromometer. One of these is placed N. and S. and the

other E. and W. The variation in temperature in the room seldom ex-

ceeds 1° or 2° F. per day. These levels have shown continual movements.

At present the N. and S. level has a diurnal backward and forward

motion of about three divisions. One division equals about 2" of arc.

As an example of the larger movements which have been recoi'ded, I may

state that the bubble of the X. and S. level moved, from March 25 to

May 4, through twenty-nine divisions. The direction of the deflection of

the tromometer pendulum has a general correspondence witli these larger

Amovements.  curious phenomenon which has been observed in the
--levels is that accompanying a barometrical depression there is a slight

surging in the bubbles. The surge, which has an amplitude of from '25

to "5 of a division is irregular, having a period of from 1 to 5 or 6 seconds.

This motion, inasmuch as it is different from the effects produced by

alterations in temperature, and as it accords with the microseismic move-

ments of the tromometer, I am inclined to attribute to a true earth-

pulsation.

     Another phenomenon indicative of the existence of earth-pulsations

--by which I mean motions which may have an amplitude equal to that of

an earthquake, but which are not perceived on account of the slowness

--of their period is the slow surge-like motion in a level, which continne.s

for fully three or four minutes after all sensible motion of an earthquake

has disappeared. This surging, as it dies out, closely accoi'ds with the

surge observed at the time of a barometrical depression.

This last observation is suppiementaiy to observations made on an

earthquake with a seismograph. The records from a seismograph show

that a moderately strong disturbance sometimes commences as a series of

tremors with a frequency of from 4 to 6 per second. These movements

are so small in amplitude that, unless an observer is f^ivourably situated,

they are passed by unnoticed. While they continue, however, I haA-e

heard pheasants scream, and it has been noticed that frogs cease their

croaking. Immediately after the tremors we get the shock of the earth-

quake, some of the vibrations of which have occasionally been performed

so rapidly that I liave failed to measure their duration. It is not unlikely

that this portion of an earthquake may take place so suddenly that rocky

strata in the immediate vicinity of the origin haxo not time for elastic
ON THE EARTHQUAKE PHENOMENA OF JAPAN.  213

yielding. The effect is that of a sudden push. The area thus affected

my colleague, Professor T. Alexander, has called the core of the earth-

quake. The existence of an earthquake-core is one means of explaining
the enormously high velocities of propagation which I and other observers
have from time to time recorded. After the pu^Ji, or shock come the re-
sulting irregular tremors. These continually slow down in their period
until, when they reach a period of two or three seconds, the seismograph
ceases to act. The slow irregular surging of a level appears to be a con-

tinuation of the record of a seismograph.

  --In these respects the vibratory motions of an earthquake are analogous

to a spectrum of light there being two extremities which with ordinary

--instruments are usually unobserved at one end because the vibrations

are too quick, and at the other end because they are too slow. The
accompanying diagram of the earthquake of March 11, 1882, shows the

portion of an earthquake registered by an ordinary seismograph.

    A set of experiments which I am now engaged upon in Japan has for

its object the determination of some true measure of the inteusity of an

artificial disturbance produced by the explosion of a charge of dynamite
as it radiates from its origin. Rather than estimate the intensity of an
impulse at a point, by vague terms or by an arbitrary scale of degrees, I
have attempted to measure the intensity of a shock by the stresses it is
--214
                     EEroET 1883.

capable of producing in bodies on the earth's surface. One estimate of

these stresses is the acceleration a body receives.

-- VIntensity thus
    defined          may be  written  Y2                    is the maximum
                                          , where

velocity of a vibrating particle, and a is its amplitude, or half a semi-

--oscillation. This quantity, , is the maximum acceleration of an earth-
                                             a

particle, assuming the motion to be simple harmonic,

--I have calculated  for the prominent vibrations of a number of

disturbances, each disturbance being recorded at several stations.

     The results of these calculations show that as a disturbance radiates the

intensity dies out, rapidlj' at first, but eventually very slowly. The results
give a carve which is a rough approximation to an equilateral hyperbola.

     Trom these observations it would appear that by obtaining the curve
of intensity for any given disturbance we may, by comparing with the
curves obtained by the explosion of known charges of dynamite, approxi-

raately obtain some absolute measures of earthquake energy.

     The accompanying diagram gives the mean of the results obtained in

a series of experiments in which the surface of the ground was put into
vibration by the explosion of charges of dynamite put into bore-holes
about ten feet deep. The ordinatos give intensity, and the abscissa
distance from the orio-in in feet.

     The shocks which are usually felt in Tokio and Yokohama, as

calculated from diagrams, have a maximum acceleration of from 20 to
200 millimetres per second. When this exceeds 300 millimetres we may

expect chimneys to be cracked, and slight damage of a like nature done

to buildinofs.

     To complete this investigation I have the intention of comparing
together the maximum velocity of an earth-particle, as computed from a

--diagram, with that calculated by the projection or overthrow of a body

of known dimension the impulse being given by the explosion of a

charge of dynamite.

    An investigation which I described in my last report to the British

Association was the determination of the existence of an earth-current at
the time of an earthquake. I then stated that a strong current was
produced in a land line connected with an earth plate which had been

shaken. This confirmed the numerous records which we have of currents
ON THE EARTHQUAKE PHENOMENA OF JAPAN.  215

being prodnced at the time of earthquakes. Another set of records, which

we are in possession of, indicate that many earthquakes have been

preceded by earth-currents.

     If, as we have reason to believe, certain earthquakes are the result of

a sudden breaking in the rocky crust of the earth, produced by bend-^
ing due, for example, to elevatory pressure, it would seem possible that,
in consequence of the compressions and extensions to which the rocks are
subjected prior to their collapse, electrical phenomena might be produced.

     To test the truth of this supposition Mr. T. Gray has undertaken a
series of experiments which are not completed. Preliminary results of

these experiments seem to indicate that a difference of potential is
prodnced between the two sides of a slab of rock when it is bent.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr. E. Etheridge, Dr. H.
   Woodward, and Professor T. Kupert Jones {Secretary), on the

   Fossil Phyllopoda of the Palmozoic Rochs.

Of the collections known to contain many of the fossil Phyllopods, those
in the British Museum and the Museum of Practical Geology, in London,
that of the Woodwardian Museum, Cambridge, and of Owens College,
Manchester, have been carefully examined ; and sketches have been made

of the numerous specimens. Tracings of all the published figures have

also been carefully made, to ensure ready collation of the many different

forms. Information has been cheerfully communicated by Mr. Homfray,
Mr. Valpy, Mr. Marr, and others, who have collected specimens at various

times and places.
     Time has not yet allowed of our inspection of the Phyllopodous fossils

at the Oxford University Museum, nor at the Ludlow, Glasgow, Edin-
burgh, and other rich museums ; but from the type specimens preserved
either in London or at Cambridge, we have been able to make the follow-
ing observations on Hymenocaris, Caryocaris, and Lingulocaris, three of
the oldest genera ; and the accompanying synopsis indicates our present
opinion of the relationship and range of all the genera with which we are

and descriptions given by our fellow-workers in North America and else-

where.

     During our study of Hymenocaris we found that ' H. ? major,'' Salter,'
comprised a Ceratiocaris possibly matching the Tremadoc specimens
assigned to the genus by Mr. Salter ; and we have therefore put it under
the more authentic of the two Tremadoc species noticed by him.

      The Australian Eymenocaris Salteri, M'Coy, having been assigned by
Mr. Salter to Caryocaris, when he was studying that group in 1862, we
have regarded it as a member of the latter genus.

     With Caryocaris Marrii, Hicks, is a specimen associated under the
same name in the Woodwardian Museum that proves to be an Entomidella

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

as it differs somewhat from the known species of that genus, it is now
named I]. Marrii. Of the other specimens named C. Marrii, some do
not differ from C. Wrightii, Salter ; but one retains the specific name

given by Dr. Hicks.

      Besides the Lingulocaris linguloecomes, Salter, some casts in the British

Museum seem to warrant the adoption of a new name, L. siliquiformis,

 for a different but allied form.

    This palaeozoic Phyllopod was first noticed and named by Mr. J. Wk

Salter in the Report of the British Association (Belfast Meeting) for

1852, ' Trans. Sect.' pp. 57, 58. Its very common species H. vermicauda
was more fully described, -with figures, by Salter in the ' Memoirs of the

Geol. Survey Great Britain,' &c., vol. iii., 1866, p. 293 ; t. 2, f. 1-4
t. 4, f. 25. It has been found in the Lower Lingula-flags of North Wales.

    The terms of generic description are

    * Carapace ample, semi-oval, narrowed towards the front, curved

downward at the sides, but not angularly bent along the dorsal line ; no
external eyes ; antennae ? ; abdomen as long as, or longer than, the cara-

pace ; of nine transverse segments, the last with three pairs of unequal

lanceolate appendages.'

    Hymenocans vermicauda, Salter, 1853, has its carapace folded or bent

along the back, so as to form two symmetrical valve-like sides, somewhat

resembling saddle-flaps, obliquely rounded or semi-elliptical below, and

with a very slightly convex dorsal line. The curvature of the ventral

edge varies in fulness and in obliquity with individuals, and is nearly

always modified by the pressure to which the schist containing the fossils

has been subjected. The specimens are all flattened ; some are lengthened,

and some shortened, according to their position relative to the direction

of  the squeeze                                                      and nearly all  are crumpled  or ' plaited ' '  with  parallel
                                                                  ;

foldings, coarse or fine, at right angles to the line of lateral pressure.

    Some of the best preserved individuals measure ^^ inch, others 1

inch, and others (imperfect otherwise) even more, along the back line.

Those with the first two measurements are y^f inch in height ; and their

angular length (from antero-dorsal to postero-ventral points) is 1 j^^ inch.

Many smaller individuals occur.

   =The carapace was thin (hence the name ' membranous ') . No

definite structure has been observed ; but Salter noted ' short wavy lines *

on the carapace and the abdominal segments (oj]. cit. p. 294), and a mar-

ginal furrow along the posterior border of the valves (p. 293).

    Owing to the compressed condition of the schists,- it is difiicult to

define the original outline of the ends of the carapace. The fig. 4 in pi. 2,
' Mem. Geol. Surv.' iii., is a restoration, and its truncate anterior end is

a very doubtful feature. The outline given of a specimen shown in fig. 3,,
loc. cit., is not supported by the specimen itself. The front angle, though

often modified or suppressed by the imperfect cleavage of the schist, is

sometimes perfect enough to show that it was much sharper than in the

fig. 4 referred to above, in which the truncation is probably due to

fracture of the specimen taken as the type. The posterior margin usually

appears to have sloped downwards and outwards, with a bold ventral

curve, but without the elegant sinuous (ogee) bend, under the dorsal

angle, which Ceratiocaris usually exhibits.

    The relative position of carapace and body-segments has been sub-

jected to much interference, between the death and the imbedment of

the specimens, from the decomposition of the soft parts or connecting

tissues, and the shifting of the harder relics yet Mr. Salter's determina-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

hinder margin seems to be well founded, whether the abdomen be still in

apposition or not.

The crumpled bed-planes of the schists frequently exhibit crushed'

body-joints of the Hymenocaris ; but these relics of the abdominal portion

vary much in the number of attached segments. Sometimes four or five,
but not uncommonly six or seven, body-joints occur, with or without the

telson being apparent. Eight or nine together are less frequent. In one

instance (in the Owens College Museum) eleven segments can be counted,

besides an obscure telson, in an unattached body lying on a slab contain-
ing numerous specimens of carapaces and body-rings of Hymenocaris

(from Carrig-felen, collected and given by Mr. D. Homfray). In this
case, some (five or six), which appear to have been narrower and softer

than the others, may have been within the carapace, for they differ from

the others in size and distinctness of outline. The crushing and squeeze

have rendered even the best and most promising specimens so obscure

that much doubt still exists in the observations on this Phyllopod. Mr.

Salter determined nine exposed body-rings (op. cit. p. 293 ; but only eight

shown in t. 2, f. 4), with one pair of styles and two pairs of stylets
attached to the last joint (op. cit. t. 5, f. 2). The abdominal joints vary

^from about y'V to -^ inch in height, sometimes to -{'q, very rarely to
y\j- and -^-Q, but in one case to   inch, according to size of individuals

and the accidental crush.

Hymenocaris vermicaucla occurs in the Lower Lingula-flags, espe-

cially ' in the upper portions of the true Lingula-flags ' (Salter, oj}.

owen, and other places near Dolgelly ; and doubtfully at Pont Seiont,

ACaernarvon.  specimen in the British Museum is from the ' Upper

Tremadoc ' schist (or hard shale) of Garth, near Portmadoc.

The rippled flagstones of the Lingula series near Tremadoc, at the

village of Y-Felin-Newydd, and near Pentrefelen and Wern, on the

Criccieth road, are marked with tracks referred, with good reason, by

Mr. Salter to Hymenocaris vermicaucla (' Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc' vol. x.,

1854, pp. 208-211 ; and 'Mem. Geol. Surv.' vol. iii. p. 218 and p. 294,

pi. 1).

     The foregoing observations apjDly to H. vermicatida. Mr. Salter noticed

another fossil from the Linguia-fiags, which he referred to the same genus

in 1873, having, however, designated it Sacocaris in 1867 (afterwards

spelt Saccocaris correctly).

     In the ' Catal. Pal. Foss. Cambr.' p. 7, Mr. Salter entered the species

as ' Hymenocaris {Saccocaris, Halifax Trans. ^ 1867) major, Salter, n.s.

    In the Woodwardian Museum at Cambridge are three specimens,
A/160 (two), and A/174, from the uppermost part of the Lower Lingula-

flags at Caer-y-coed quarry, and labelled as belonging to H. / major,

Salter.

---1. One of them                                          is a large oblong valve measuring 4^-y by 2 inches,

truncate (with slight convexity of outline) at one end, and obliquely rounded

at the other ; the greatest convexity of the broad (posterior ?) end being
a very little above the median line of the valve, and that of the narrower

end considerably above that line. This appears to be a right valve, gently

hollow, showing its inside ; it is a mere film on the black schist, and is
delicately plaited and gently undulate throughout, in lines parallel to the

long axis of the valve, cleavage-pressure having compressed and corrugated

the surface from edge to edge; and at the posterior (?) end of the valve
the margin is barely perceptible, being fringed off by its extremely plaited

state, or (in other words) frittered away in longitudinal shreds parallel

with the plaiting of the schist, showing, probably, that this end was of

thinner consistence than the rounded end. This condition often occurs

with the ends of phyllopodous specimens in the Lingula-flags. There are

also some irregular concentric lines in the antero-ventral area, caused by

the depression of the convexity of the valve. By lateral pressure the

specimen must have lost something in height, and has had its length

exaggerated. This specimen is evidently the one refeiu-ed to in the ' Rep.

Proc. Geol. Polytech. Soc. W.T.' iv. p. 589, which was at first thought

to be a                            ' hollow  oblong       scute,  after the manner  of  A'ptis '                       but the  ' three

distinct ridges on the hinder border ' are not at all visible. Though of

extraordinary size, this may be regai'ded as a Hymenocaris, after Salter's

determination, in the absence of evidence to the contrary. The occurrence

of single valves is not uncommon, though the carapace does not appear to

have been sutured.

   --A2. The second specimen in the Woodwardian Museum, also marked -

is of smaller size (3yV X to inch), narrower, and more silicular in

shape                              and  it   has  a   distinctly   emarginate  posterior  end,                         though   this
                                ;

feature can be recognised in the black schist only by reflected light at a

certain angle. It is coarsely plaited lengthwise, narrowed (contracted in

height), and much lengthened. The emarginate or sinuous end is different

from that of Hgrnenocaris, and similar to that of Ceratiocaris. Nevertheless,

it may possibly (though not probably) have been produced by the strong

tendency of the schist to take on a state of cleavage, crumpling up the

posterior margin by pressure contrary to its direction.

after noticing that the Australian Graptolites sent to the International-

footnote (p. lo9) : ' There is even a crustacean [from the same Australian

beds], apparently of the genus Caryocaris, which M'Coy has done me the-

favour to name Hymenocaris Salteri.' Thus it is evident that Salter saw

one example, if not more, of this Australian sjsecies in 1862, and did not

regard it as a Hymenocaris.

Pal. Foss. Cambridge.' 1873, p. 21). H. Woodward mentions Barff and

Longside, ' Cat. Brit. Crust.' p. 70. It has been collected by Mr. J. E. Marr,
F.G.S., at the Nantlle tramway, Pont Seiont, near Caernarvon (Upper-
Arenig group). See ' Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc' xxxii., 1876, p. 134. The-
tramway is here called the ' Wantlle railroad.' The ' phyllopod crustaceans '

mentioned at p. 135, and preserved in the Woodwardian Museum, Cam-
bridge, are several specimens of Caryocaris, and some small caudal styles
which may have belonged to Caryocaris, though they resemble somewhat

those associated with the Upper- Silurian Peltocaris and Discinocaris in the-
Coniston mudstone of Skelgill, also collected by Mr. Marr.

      Salter determined Caryocaris (' Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc' xix. p. 139) as

having a ' bivalved carapace (with distinct hinge-pits) , rounded anteriorly,

subtruncate behind, and with the back and front subparallel. The surface

is smooth, or with only oblique wrinkles near the margins, but with no

parallel lines of sculpture.' The body and abdominal appendages were
unknown to Mr. Salter ; but he suggested, in a restoration (op. cit. p. 137,
fig. 15), a short abdomen, with a lanceolate telson and stylet. Mr. Marr

has found, in association with Ganjocaris, at the tramway bridge crossing

the Seiont above mentioned, some small slender spines or pointed styles,

from about y^^^ to |f inch in length, which do not contradict Salter's ideal

"figure.

The test is smooth and thick, somewhat horny in ajDpeai-ance, often

with light purplish tints, rarely black ; the ventral and anterior margins

are thickened with a raised rim. The anterior moiety is not so much

contracted as shown in Salter's illustrations, fig. 15, he. cit., and the

figure at p. 21 ' Camb. Catal.' ; nor is there a rim to the dorsal margin,
as in the first of those figures. The ' hinge-pits ' have also escaped our

observation as yet. The most perfect specimens are suboblong and

elongate, very slightly convex on the dorsal border ; more so on the

ventral, which is elliptically curved, with the convexity slightly greater

in its hinder than in its front moiety ; both ends truncate, one end

·(posterior) rather higher than the other ; both vertical, angular at top,

and neatly curbed below ; but sometimes modified in direction and form
by compression. Owing to the relative solidity of the valves this fossil

is not unfrequently preserved in shape, even when the ' plaiting ' or

imperfect cleavage of the pressed schist crosses them at various angles.
Hence these valves are not nearly so much altered in form in the Skiddaw

slates as the Hijmenocarides are in the Liugula-flags yet occasionalh'',

In the Woodwardian Museum, Cambridge, four specimens, from the

Upper-Arenig schists on the Nantlle tramway, are labelled G. Marrii,

Hicks. 1. One, with a black test, compressed, measures -{^^ x y\ inch,
and this has been so squeezed that possibly it is now even nai'rower than

it originally was ; but the front end is broken and the hinder end is

fringed oS" with the ' plaiting ' of the schist. This seems to be C. Wrightii.

AIt is somewhat thickened at the ventral edge. 2. similar, but imper-

fect, specimen, modified with oblique ' plaiting.' Ventral border thickened.

3. Two imperfect specimens on one slab, one of which, probably 1 inch

long, is only                        -f^-  inch across (high), and has two obscure depressions

across its middle. One end seems perfect ; the other is fringed out.

This approaches most nearly to Dr. Hicks's description of G. Marrii.

4. The other specimen is decidedly an Entomidella (f\ x ^^ inch), rather
smaller than the Menevian E. hiiprestis (Salter), and thinner or sharper

posteriorly in proportion. It may be named Entomidella Marrii (Hicks),

A similar form occurs in the Skiddaw slate (-f^ Mus. Pract. Geol.).
ON THE FOSSIL PHTLLOPODA OF THE PALAEOZOIC EOCKS.   223

    In the Museum of Practical Geology, London, there is a small specimen

(DyV, P- 11 of the ' Catal. Cambr. Sil. Foss ' 1878), labelled ' Entomidella,
Lin gula- flags, St. David's,' but it has no cross furrow, and resembles

Caryocaris in outline. It measures iiy X -f^ inch, and, though small, may

be C. Wrightii.

    We have already remarked (see above, p. 7) that Mr. Salter recognised

a Caryocaris among the Australian fossils exhibited at the International

Exhibition at London in 1862.

LiNGULOCAEis, Salter, 1866.

This was determined and described as a pateozoic bivalved Phyllopod,

from the Upper-Tremadoc schists of Tuhwnt-y-bwlch, Garth, Portmadoc,

North Wales, by Mr. J. W. Salter, in the 'Memoirs of the Geological

-- ASurvey,' vol. iii. (1866), pp. 252, 253, and 294. His description of the

generic characters is as follows : ' thin bivalve crustacean shell, with

a generic form like that of a Modiola or Mytilus, with scarcely prominent

beaks, and no ? hinge-teeth ; the surface of the carapace is covered by

Afine raised concentric lines.'  description of L. lingulcecomes, Salter,

follows, and this form is figured in pi. 10, figs. 1 and 2. See also the

* Catal. of Cambrian and Silurian Fossils in the Geol. Mus., Cambridge,'

1873, p. 16, with a figure.

    In the Woodwardian Museum at Cambridge are two specimens of a

bivalve ('A 273'), there labelled ' Hhjfilocuris llncjulcecomes, Salter,' from

the above-mentioned locality, one of which, seemingly representing the

outside, but somewhat crumpled longitudinally, approximates in its

=outline and size (1^^ X \ inch 32 x 12 mm.) to Mr. Salter's restora-

tion (?), fig. 1, pi. 10, and fig. in ' Cat. Cambridge Foss.' p. 16. The

other is a less perfect internal cast. Otherwise we have not met with

any corresponding specimen.

In the British Museum are casts of the insides of two bivalves

('48654' and another), labelled ^ Lingulocaris ; but, though probably
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           '

Ijelonging to Mr. Salter's genus here mentioned, they differ much from

its first species in outline. They are longer, sharper at one end, and

more nearly resembling a pea-pod in shape. This species may be dis-
tinguished as L. siliquiformis. One specimen (presented by the Rer. 1 1^'

J. F. Blake) is from the Upper-Tremadoc schists at Garth Hill, Port-

madoc, and the other ('48654') is from the Bale schist at Bvvlch-y-

Gaseg, near Cynwyd, Corwen, collected by ' J. R.'

In Mr. Salter's figures of L. lingulcecomes the furrow (slight as it is),

passing obliquely from the umbo backwards to the upper part of the

posterior margin is a very interesting feature, being emphasised and

duplicated in the oblong and angular Myocaris, Salter, from the palaeozoic

pebbles of the Triassic conglomerate at Budleigh-Salterton in Devon. It

is also repi'esented in the oblong Sohnocaris, J. Young, from the Llandeilo

or Caradoc-Bala strata of Penwhapple in Ayrshire, but at a difi'erent
angle, lower down on the surface, and accompanied with two other

shallow furi'ows radiating from the umbo. These features ai-e not without

homologies in another Phyllopod, the Carboniferous Leaia, where radiating

ridges, equivalent to the convex boundai-ies of the furrows in the preceding

forms, are characteristic of the carapace- valves.
224 EEPORT-- 1883.

Third Re'port of the Covimittee, consisting of INIr. Sclateb, Mr.
   Howard Saunders, and Mr. Thiseltox-Dyer (Secretary), ap-
   pointed for the purpose of investigating the Natural History of

    Timor-laut.

Your Committee was disappointed in the result of its application at
the Southampton meeting for a further grant of lOOZ. in aid of Mr.
Forbes's expedition. The sum of 50Z. which was placed at its disposal
was practically only a re-vote of the grant made at Swansea, which had
lapsed. In the meantime Mr. Forbes had been obliged to draw bills
upon his fi'iends in London to meet the expenses he had incurred in
preparing for the expedition, and the sum of 50Z. was, therefore, drawn
as soon as possible and paid to Mr. Alexander Comyns, who had a power

of attorney to act on Mr. Forbes's behalf in London.

    When your Committee last reported, it was only able to state that
Mr. Forbes had reached Amboina in May of 1882, and was on the point

of starting for the Tenimber Islands on the first practicable opportunity.

He effected his departure after some delay, and in October following a.

letter was received from him, from which the following is an extract :

                                           ' On board the s.s. "Amboina," at the Aru Islands :

                                                                                      'July 12, 1882.

   --' Dear Mr. Dyer, I write you a note to state that to-morrow morning

I hope to be deposited, bag and baggage, at Larat, the small island facing:

arrival in Amboina, otherwise I should have been three weeks ago on the-

myisland of  destination.

' From all accounts received on the coast of Xew Guinea and at Ke,

as well as here, the natives are very well disposed, and I am very sanguine

of a successful termination to my journeyings there. I hope to despatch

some part of my collections about the middle of September.

     In December following your Committee were gratified at receiving
the following further letter from Mr. Forbes, stating that he had succeeded
in a great measure in accomplishing his mission, though not without

much difficulty and even serious sacrifice of health :

                           'Amboina: October 11, 1882.

--' Dear Mr. Dyer, I have only just time to write you a line to inform

you of my return from Timor-laut a couple of days ago, having been

compelled to leave on account of sickness and of the hostility of the

of this interesting country will be sent to you by next mail. One of the

singular facts I found is the immense herds of wild buffalo existing on

the mainland of the island. They must have, of course, been introduced,

but by whom and how long ago is an interesting question. I was unable

to get a specimen, unfortunately.

In the month of January following a box containing seventy bird-

skins was received from Mr. Forbes, with the note, ' This first instalment

of birds is a rough selection, which, probably, may contain new species.'

The collection was examined by Mr. Sclater, who communicated an

account of it to the meeting of the Zoological Society on February 20.

The species were fifty-five in number, sixteen of which were described in

the paper as new to science. ' The general facies of the avifauna, as thus

indicated, was stated to be decidedly Papuan, with a slight Timorese

element, evidenced by the occurrence of certain species of Oeocichla and

Urythrnra, while the new one {Sirix sororcula) was apparently a diminutive

form of a peculiar Australian species.'

About the same time your Committee received from Mr. Forbes a

detailed report of his proceedings in Timor-laut. This was an extremely

interesting document, but dealt principally with ethnographical details.

Your Committee, therefore, decided that it should be communicated at

once to the Anthropological Institute; and this Mr. John Evans, Treasurer

of the Royal Society and Vice-President of the Institute, very kindly

undertook to do. The paper was read at the meeting on March 13, and

has since been published in the ' Journal ' of the Institute.

In February the bulk of Mr. Forbes's collections reached Kew in four

cases. They contained an extremely complete ethnographical collection,

a further collection of birds, a collection of twelve crania and specimens

of human hair, and a miscellaneous zoological collection. Your Committee

decided that a selection from the ethnographical collection should be

handed to Mr. Franks, keeper of the Department of Ethnography in the

British Museum                                                                                           that  the  additional  birds should  be  examined  by  Mr.
                                                                                                      ;

Sclater, and that the miscellaneous zoological collections should be sent

to the zoological department of the British Museum to be selected from.

AThis was accordingly done.                                                                                         series of the ethnographical specimens

was sent to the meeting at the Anthropological Institute to illustn-ate the

reading of Mr. Forbes's report, and a description of these drawn up by

Mr. C. H. Read is printed as an appendix to the paper in the ' Journal ' of

the Institute. Professor Flower, who presided on the occasion, also stated

that ' the results of a cursory examination of the twelve crania which
Mr. Forbes had collected were that eight were brachycephalic, and of
decidedly Malay type; one was dolichocephalic, prognathous, and with

large teeth, indicating Papuan or Melanesian affinities; and the other-
three were more or less intermediate. This is what might have been

expected on the border-land of two distinct races ; but the great pre-
ponderance of the first-named was very marked. Nearly all showed signs-

of artificial flattening of the occipital region.'

At the meeting of the Zoological Society on April 17, Mr. Sclaterrefid

a second paper on the additional birds collected by Mr. Forbes in the

Tenimber group. ' The avifauna of the group, as indicated by Mr,

Forbes's collection, contained fifty-nine species, of which twenty-two were

peculiar to these islands.'

    At the meeting of the same society on May 1, Mr. W. F. Kirby

reported on the small collection of Hymenoptera (five new species were
described) and of Diptera sent home by Mr. Forbes. On June 5 a com-

munication was read from Mr. A. G. Butler, containing an account of

the twenty-three Lepidoptera. These comprised 23 species of Lepi-

doptera                                      the butterflies were well preserved,                                                   the moths in poor condition.

equalled by those from Aru, New Guinea, and Amboina combined.' Mr.

Boulenger also reported, at the same meeting, upon the reptiles and

--batrachians. Two new species were described the one a lizard of the

Australian genus Lophognathus, and the other a snake of the Indian

genus Simotes. ' The snake was of special interest, as no species of the

genus Simotes had hitherto been previously known to occur eastward of

Java.'

Some discussion having taken place with Mr. Comyns, Mr. Forbes's

representative in England, as to the way the Timor-laut collections should

be dealt with, your Committee proposed to Mr. Comyns, as the condition

upon which any grants of money made to it should be handed over to

Mr. Forbes, that of the collections made by him, ' both zoological and

botanical, the first complete set is to be placed at the disposal of the

Committee.' To this Mr. Comyns agreed. He subsequently raised the

question as to whether the ethnographical collections came within the

terms of this agreement. Your Committee thought the point doubtful.

At the same time they were very anxious that the fruits of Mr. Forbes's

expedition should be accessible in public museums, and should not be

dispersed in private hands. It was ultimately agreed that a selection

from tbe ethnographical collection should be purchased for the British

Museum ; and the Royal Society, at the instance of Mr. John Evans, very

liberally voted the sum of 40Z., which was fixed by Mr. Franks as a

Areasonable price for the collection.                                                                                               few objects were selected as suitable

for the Museum of Economic Botany at Kew, and these were purchased

from Mr. Comyns as a set-oS" against the expenses incurred for the

freight of the whole collections. The duplicates of the ethnographical

and other collections wei'e all duly handed over to Mr. Comyns.

Mr. Forbes's botanical collections have not at present reached Kew

but there is reason to fear, from a variety of circumstances beyond Mr.

Forbes's control, that they will prove of inferior interest to the other

collections made by him.

Your Committee understand that the total expense of Mr. Forbes's
ON THE NATUE.VL HISTORY OF SOCOTEA.  227

expedition has amounted to 300Z. Towards this he has now received

assistance from the British Association and the Royal Society to the

amount of about 1901. He may to some moderate extent recoup himself

further by the sale of duplicates.
     Your Committee, on reviewing what has been accomplished since its

first appointment, are of opinion that the Association may fairly con-

gratulate itself on the successful result of an expedition carried out in a
most efiicient, but most economical way; it would probably not have
been undertaken at all withoat its timely assistance. They believe that
the scientific results obtained do not fall short of their original anticipa-

tions. Timor-laut,^ as its name indeed implies, is the last link to the
east of the Malayan insular chain, and the commingling of the forms of
life belonging to the great geographical regions, the Malayan and the

Papuan, which it exhibits, is of peculiar interest, and merits the most

careful study.

     Your Committee believe that the Association would not wish that a

scientific man like Mr. Forbes, who has carried out a task of so laborious

and, indeed, perilous a kind should be dealt with in anything short of a

reasonably liberal way.

     Having regard, therefore, to the fact that the botanical collections
have still to be discussed, and the anthropological and ethnographical
collections more fully worked out, your Committee ask for their re-
appointment, and that a sum of lOOZ. should be placed at their disposal.
The grant of 501. made at Southampton was, as already stated, prac-
tically only a re-vote of the grant made at Swansea, which lapsed.

     Mr. Forbes will be present at the Southport meeting.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Lieut.-Col. Godwin-Austen,
    Dr. G, Hartlaub, Sir J. Hooker, Dr. Gunther, Mr. Seebohm,

   and Mr. P. L. Sclater (Secretary), appointed for the purpose of
   investigating the Natural History of Socotra and the adjacent
   Highlands of Arabia and Somali Land.

The balance left in the hands of the Committee last year was 143?. 13s. 2cl.
Together with interest since accrued it now amounts to 145Z. Is. 10c?.

There has been no further sale of the duplicates, but a few specimens
of some of the land and fresh- water shells still remain on hand for

disposal.

     Professor Bayley Balfour's labours on the botanical collection made

in Socotra are nearly brought to a close, and the results will shortly be
published in a volume of the ' Transactions ' of the Royal Society of

Edinburgh. The value and completeness of this memoir will be much

increased by the additional specimens subsequently obtained in Socotra
by Dr. Schweinfurth, which have been lent to Professor Balfour by the

collector.

228 REPORT-- 1883.

     The fresh-water shells collected by Professor Balfour have been
described by Lieut.-Col. Godwin-Austen, in a paper read before the
iZoological Society of London in January last, and pablished in the first

part of their ' Proceedings ' for the present year.

     The Diatomaccae have been examined by Mr. Kilton of Norwich, and
described in a paper which will be read before the Linnean Society of
London during their next session.

     These two papers have to be added to the list of papers on the
natural history of Socotra resulting from Professor Balfour's expedition
specified in the last report of the Committee.

     The Committee are of opinion that these contributions, along with the
botanical memoir of Professor Balfour (on what was naturally the richest
part of the collection, and on which most of his limited time in Socotra
was spent), taken together have yielded a rich return for the several sums

o£ money granted to them by the Association. When tlie aid of

the Association was first asked for this purpose an almost absolute

ignorance of the Fauna and Flora of Socotra existed. Now both Fauna

and Flora are at all events generally known, and their relationships
with those of the mainland and adjoining islands have been more or less
accurately pointed out. Although a second expedition to Socotra would
be desirable, and the exploration of the adjacent highlands in Arabia and
Africa would certainly add much to our knowledge, there seems to the
Committee little prospect of accomplishing these objects under the present
state of circumstances in the East. The Committee have therefore
repaid to the Treasurer of the Association the above-mentioned balance
of 145Z. Is. lOd., less a small sum deducted for petty expenses. The pom-

mittee, however, trust that this amount may be again placed at their

disposal upon a future occasion should circumstances arise which would
encourage them to undertake another expedition.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Sir Joseph Hooker, Dr.

   GtJNTHER, Mr. Howard Saunders, and Mr. P. L. Sclater

   (Secretary), appointed for the purpose of exploring Kilimanjaro

   and the adjoining mountains of Eastern Equatorial Africa.

     1. In November last Sir Joseph Hooker communicated with Dr.
Schweinfurth, now residing at Cairo, informing him of the wish of the

Committee, that he should be furnished with information respecting the
projected expedition, and expressing a hope that he would volunteer to

lead it. Dr. Schweinfurth replied to Sir J. Hooker on November 25 that
he regretted to say his services were not available.

     2. Upon this Sir Joseph Hooker, as authorised by the Committee,
wrote, on December 8, to Dr. Watt, of the Bengal Education Department,
Calcutta, a traveller and collector in all parts of India, who had lately

returned from accompanying, as botanist, a survey of Munnipore. Dr.
Watt having professed his willingness to undertake the expedition, Sir J.
Hooker wrote officially, on March 21, to the Secretaiy of State of India
in Council, requesting that Dr. Watt's services might be placed at the
ON THK MIGRATION OF BIRDS.  229'

disposal of tlie Committee. This was granted on May 9, but on terms so

prejudicial to Dr. Watt's interest as an officer in the Government service,

that he could not avail himself of the commission.

     3. In the meanwhile Dr. Watt was appointed to duties in connection

with the International Exhibition to be held in Calcutta in 1884. This,
appointment would necessarily postpone Dr. Watt's departure to Africa

until 1885.

      4. Considering the gi'eat probability of further obstacles arising to

pi-event Dr. Watt from undertaking the conduct of the expedition, in
case he should again come forward, we think that any reasonable hope of
securing his services must be abandoned, and that further steps should be

taken to secure a proper leader.

     5. With this object Sir J. Hooker has placed himself in communica-

tion with Capt. Maloney, late Administrator of the Gold Coast, respecting-
a medical officer in the Colonial Service, of whose ability and industry

Capt. Maloney has spoken in very high terms, and who, we have reason
to hope, will undertake the expedition. Should this not be the case we

shall do our best to find another fit person for the purpose.

    6. Under these circumstances the Committee trust that the sum of

500^., voted at Southampton, which has been returned to the Treasurer

of the Association in accordance with the regulations, mav be revoted to-

them at the present meeting.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr. John Cordeaux
   {Secretary), ]\Ir. J. A. Harvie-Brown, Mr. P. M, C. Kermode,
   Professor Newton, Mr. E. M. Barrington, and Mr. A. G. More,
   reappointed at Southampton, for the purpose of obtaining (xvith
   the consent of the Master and Brethren of the Trinity House, and
   the Commissioners of Northern and Irish Lights) observations
   on the Migration of Birds at Lighthouses and Lightships, and,
   of reporting on the same.

The General Report ' of the Committee, of which this is an abstract,,
comprises the observations taken at lighthouses and lightvessels, and a
few special land stations, on the east and west coasts of England and
Scotland, the coasts of Ireland, Isle of Man, Channel Islands, Orkney

--and Shetland Isles, the Hebrides, Faroes, Iceland, and Heligoland, and

one Baltic station -Stevns Fyr on Stevns Klint, Zealand, for which the
Committee is indebted to Professor Liitken, of Copenhagen. Altogether
196 stations have been supplied with schedules and printed instructions

--for registering observations, and returns have been received from about

123 a result which is very satisfactory, showing as it does the general
interest taken in the work, and the ready co-operation given by the
lightkeepers in assisting the Committee.

     The stations returning the best-filled schedules are : on the East

Coast of Scotland, the Pentland Skerries, nine, Sunbnrgli Head, fonr,

Bell Rock, three, and Isle of May no less than nineteen ; on the east coast
of England, Fame Islands, eleven, and after this Flamborough Head,

Spurn Point, and several of the lightvessels off our south-east coast.

On the Irish coast the best returns have come in from the Tuscar rock

on the Wexford coast. This is the extreme south-eastern point of Ireland,

and the nearest land to the Welsh coast, and seems vrell situated for

observations.

Taken as a whole, and comparing them with reports from the

English coasts and elsewhere, it is evident that Ireland lies compara-

tively out of the track of migrants, and its western stations are espe-

cially poor. These have, however, much interest in themselves, in the

notices of the movements and habits of the various seafowl frequenting

that wild district.

The entries in the schedules returned to us have, as might be ex-

pected, special reference to the movements of various species of land-

birds, yet many observations will be found in the general report, on the

going and coming of seafowl, which dwell for a season on the cliffs,

islands, and outlying rocks off our coasts, their mode of feeding, nesting,

&c. These are valuable as made by those who actually live amongst

the birds, and have ample opportunity and leisure to observe their habits

and report thereon. Thus the presence of the gannet all around the

coast of Ireland during the breeding season points to the conclusion

that a considerable proportion of the birds seen do not breed. The

Little Skellig rock, off the Kerry coast, is the only Irish breeding-

place of this species, and when visited by Mr. Barrington in 1S80

there were scarcely thirty pairs nesting there.

As in preceding years, the line of autumn migration has been a broad

stream from east to west, or from points south of east to north of west

and covering the whole of the east coast. In 1880, to judge from the

returned schedules, a large proportion of the immigrants came in at the

more southern  stations                                      in  1881  they covered  the  whole  of the east  coast
                                                          ;

in tolerably equal proportions ; but in 1882 the stations north of the

Humber show a marked preponderance of arrivals. Altogether a vast

migration took place this year upon our east coast, the heaviest waves

breaking upon the mouth of the Humber, Flamborough Head, the Fame
Islands, Isle of May at the entrance to the Firth of Forth, and again, after

missing a long extent of the Scotch coast, at the Pentland Skerries.^ The

Bell Rock also came in for a share, although apparently a much smaller

one than the Isle of May. The easterly winds prevailed all along our

east coasts, generally strong to gales, and the succession of south-easterly

and easterly gales in October, between the 8th and 23rd, occurring as

they did at the usual time of the principal migration, brought vast

numbers of land birds to our shores. From the Faroes in the north to

the extreme south of England this is found to have been the case.

  -- --Although migration that is, direct migration on our east coast,

is shown to have extended over a long period, commencing in July and

continuing, with but slight intermissions, throughout the autumn and into

     ' The absence of returns, year by year, on the Scotch coast between the Bell
Eock and Dunnet Head, embracing ten important lighthouses, is remarkable, not

a single statistic of direct value as regards general migration having, so far, rewarded

our inquiries. No communications, positive or negative, have been received from

these stations, escept a brief return from Girdleness.
ON THE MIGRATION OF BIRDS.  231

the next year to the end of January, yet the main body of migrants
appear to have reached the east coast in October, and of these a large
proportion during the first fortnight in the month. From, the 6th to the
8th inclusive, and again from the 12th to the 15th, there was, night and
day, an enoi*mous rush, under circumstances of wind and weather which,
observations have shown, are most unfavourable to a good passage.

During these periods birds arrived in an exhausted condition, and we
have reasons for concluding, from the many reported as alighting on

fishing smacks and vessels in the North Sea, that the loss of life must
have been very considerable. Large flights also are recorded as having
appeared round the lanterns of lighthouses and light- vessels during the

night migration. From the Gth to the 9th inclusive strong east winds

blew over the North Sea, with fog and drizzling rain, and from the night

of the 12th to 17th very similar weather prevailed. Mr. W. Littlewood,

of the Galloper lightship, forty miles south-east of Orfordness, reports
that, on the night of October the 6th, larks, starlings, tree-sparrows,

titmice, common wrens, redbreasts, chaffinches, and plovers were picked up
on the deck, and that it is calculated that from five to six hundred struck

the rigging and fell overboard : a large proportion of these were larks.
Thousands of birds were flying round the lantern from 11.30 p.m. to
4.45 A.M., their -white breasts, as they dashed to and fro in the circle of
light, having the appearance of a heavy snowstorm. This was repeated
on the 8th and 12th, and on the night of the 13th 160 were picked up
on deck, including larks, starlings, thrushes, and two redbreasts. It was
thought that 1,000 struck and went overboard into the sea. It is only

on dark rainy nights, with snow or fog, that such casualties occur ; when

the nights are light, or any stars visible, the birds give the lanterns a

wide berth.
     Undoubtedly the principal feature of the autumn migration has been

the extraordinary abundance of the gold-crested wren. The flights

appear to have covei-ed not only the east coast of England, but to have
extended southward to the Channel Islands and northward to the

Faroes (see Report, East Coast of Scotland). On the east coast of

England they are recorded at no less than twenty-one stations from the

Fame Islands to the Hanois, L.H., Guernsey, and on the east coast of
Scotland at the chief stations from the Isle of May to Sunburgh Head

{at which latter station they have rarely been seen in previous years).
Mr. Garrioch, writing from Lerwick, says : ' In the evening of the 9th of

October my attention was called to a large flock of birds crossing the

harbour from the island of Bressay, and on coming to a spot on the
shore where a number had taken refuge from the storm I found the
flock to consist of gold-crests and a few fire-crests ' amongst them ; the
gold-crests spread over the entire island and were observed in considerable
numbers till the middle of November.' The earliest notice on the Bast
Coast is August Gth, the latest November 5th, or ninety-two days ; they
arrived somewhat spai'ingly in August and September, and in enormous
numbers in October, more especially on the nights of October 7th and 12th,

at the latter date with the woodcock. This flight appears to have extended
across England to the Irish coast, for on the night of the 12th a dozen

struck the lantern of the Tuscar Rock Lighthouse, and on the night of

Garrioch.
232 KEPOKT-- 1883.

the IStli tliey were continually striking all night. During the autumn

enormous numbers crossed Heligoland, moi'e especially in October. On

Wethe night from the 28th to the 29th Mr. Giitke remarks : '  have had

a perfect storm of gold-crests, perching on the ledges of the Tvindow-

panes of the lighthouse, preening their feathers in the glare of the lamps.

On the 29th all the island swarmed with them, filling the gardens and

--over all the cliff hundreds of thousands. By 9 a.m. most of them had

passed on again.' Not less remarkable was the great three days' flight

of the common jay, past and across Heligoland, on the 6th, 7th, and 8th

of October. Thousands on thousands, without interruption, passed on

overhead, north and south of the island too, multitudes like a continual

stream, all going east to west in a strong south-easterly gale. It would

have been interesting if we had been able to correlate this migration of

jays with any visible arrival on our English coast, but in none of the

returns is any mention made of jays. Subsequently we have received

numerous notices of extraordinary numbers seen during the winter in our-

English woodlands. This seems especially to have been the case south

of a line drawn from Flamborough Head to Portland Bill in Dorset.

Additions and unusual numbers were also observed at Arden on Loch
Lomond side.

Immense numbers of the hedge- spaiTOw passed over Heligoland iir

October, more especially on the Gth, 7th, and 8th. It is curious that on

the 8th of the same month they swarmed in astonishing numbers both at

Spurn Point and in North-east Lincolnshire.

Woodcocks arrived on the east coast on the night of October 12th,

or early morning of the 13th. Wind east, strong, fog and drizzling rain.
On the morning of the 13th they are recorded from ten stations, covering-

350 miles of coast, from the Isle of May to Orfordness.

Some species which occur with tolerable regularity on the east coast,,

have during the autumn of 1882 been remarkably scarce. Very few

short-eared owls have been seen in England or Scotland. The common

linnet and twite have also been very scarce, and the same remai-ks apply

to Heligoland.'

The returns show very clearly that the spring lines of migi-atioo:

followed by birds ai'e the same as those in the autumn, but of course

--in the reverse direction from W. and N.W. to E. and S.E. Another

point worth noting is the occurrence of many species in spring at the

same stations frequented by the species in autumn. Thus double records

occur at the Mull of Galloway, Bell Rock, Isle of May, as well as at

some English stations.

As this is the fourth report issued by the Committee, we may perhajjs,,

with the mass of facts at our disposal, be expected to draw deductions

which, if they do not explain, may serve at least to throw some light on

Wethe causes influencing the migration of birds.  might reasonably reply

that the work undertaken by us was not to theorise, or attempt explana-

tions, but simply to collect facts and tabulate them ; this we have endea-
voured to do, in the shortest and simplest manner consistent with accuracy

of detail. There is, however, one circumstance which can scarcely fail to

present itself to those who have gone carefully into the reports issued by

the Committee, namely, the marvellous persistency with which, year by

    ' There was a vast rush of the common linnet at the Isle of May from the 9th to.

year, birds follow the same lines, or great highways, of migration, when

approaching or leaving our shores. The constancy of these periodical

phenomena is suggestive of some settled law or principle governing the

movement. It is clearly evident, from the facts already at our disposal,

that there are two distinct migrations going forward at the same time, one

the ordinary flow in the spring and ebb in the autumn across the whole

Aof Europe.  great migratory wave moves to and from the nesting-

quarters of the birds, in the coldest part of their range, north-east in the

spring and south-west in the autumn. Quite independent of this there

is a continual stream of immigrants, week by week and month by month,

to the eastern shores of these islands, coming directly across Europe from

E. to "W., or more commonly four points south of east to north of west,

and the reverse in the spring. These immigrants are mainly composed

of those common and well-known species which annually make these

islands their winter quarters, and, as a rule, take the place of our summer

birds. They come in one broad stream, but denser on some special lines

or highways than others. Cutting the line of ordinary migration at

nearly right angles, one flank brushes the Orkney and Shetland Isles,

pouring through the Pentland Firth, even touching the distant Faroes
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

the southern wing crosses the Channel Islands, shaping its course in a

north-westerly direction to the English coast.

In conclusion your Committee would take this opportunity of once

more expressing their best thanks to the Master and Brethren of the

Trinity House, the Commissioners of Northern Lights, and the Commis-

sioners of Irish Lights, for their ready co-operation and assistance, through

their officers and men, in the inquiry.

Your Committee respectfully request their reappointment, and trust

that the Association will enable them to continue the collection of facts.

R&port of the Comviittee, consisting of Dr. Pye-Smith, Professor

   M. Foster, Professor Huxley, Dr. Carpentek, Dr. Gmyn Jef-
   freys, Professor Kay Lankester, Professor Allman, and Mr.

   Percy Sladen (Secretary), appomted for the purpose of aiding
   in the maintenance of the Scottish Zoological Station.

During the past year the station has been removed from Oban to the east
coast of Scotland, where it is again erected upon the northern shore of
the Moray Frith, within a few miles of the site which it occupied in
1880-1 when the researches on the locomotor system of echinodermata
were conducted.

     Owing to an unfortunate oversight on the part of Dr. M. Foster the

grant of 40Z., which had been awarded to the station by the British Asso-

ciation, was not applied for in due time, and in consequence when it was
applied for was found to have lapsed. The researches which were con-
templated when the station was again erected on the shore of the Moray
Frith were for this and for other reasons unavoidably postponed.
Hence the only work which has been can-ied on at the station during the
:234  KEPOBT-- 1883.

past year has been that which was undertaken by Professor Schafer, on

the perivisceral fluid of echinus, published in the ' Proceedings of the
Royal Society.'

     Arrangements have now been made for the pi'osecution of several

interesting lines of research, and there is no doubt that next year, should
the British Association continue its pecuniary aid to the institution, a
more satisfactory report will be issued.

Meport of the Committee, consisting of Professor Ray Lankester,
   Professor Newtox, Professor Huxley, 31i-. P. L. Sclater, Pro-
   fessor Allmaa', Professor M. Foster, Mr. A. Sedgwick, and Mr.
   Percy Sladen (^Secretary), appointed for the purpose of arrang-.

   ing for the occupation of a Table at the Zoological Station at

    Naples.

TouE Committee, in submitting their Report on the Zoological Station

at Naples, have again the pleasure of drawing attention to the steady
progress and continued prosperity of this excellently managed institution.
That no diminution has taken place in its popularity amongst natui'alists
is fully proved by the fact that a greater number have worked at the
station during the past twelve months than in any pz'evious year. Since
the presentation of the last report two additional tables have been engaged

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

America, represented by the Williams CoUege, Massachusetts, having
secured a permanent place by contract for several years ; whilst Belgium
has taken a second table for a year, specially for the prosecution of

botanical investigations.

   --The Laboratory. Amongst recent acquisitions in this department may

 specially be mentioned a large aerating apparatus capable of supplying
about seventy small tanks and breeding aquaria simultaneously ; an
adjunct which has already proved of great value in embryological and
developmental investigations. The equipment of the tables keeps pace as
heretofore with the requirements of the improved methods of scientific
research. Several important improvements in this direction have been

made by members of the staff of the station, as, for example, the already
popular mode of manipulating serial sections detailed by Dr. Giesbrecht
in the ' Zoologischer Anzeiger ' for 1881, and more recently the improve-
ment of Jung's microtome, described in the last part of the ' Mittheilungen '

 of the station.

   --The Collecting Befartment. This department has received an important

 adjunct in the acquisition of a second steamboat. The large original
 steam yacht is still employed, as formerly, for dredging and for more
 extended excursions, whilst the new and smaller steamboat is admirably
 suited for the purpose of visiting the boats of fishermen in the bay who
 are willing to collect specimens for the station on their own account.
 Fishermen employed in this way receive from the station the necessary
 glass or other vessels in which to preserve, until fetched away by the

 steamer, whatever they may capture likely to prove interesting to zoolo-

gists. The new steamboat is also frequently used foi' towing the rowing

and the diving boats.
     In the course of next year the whole collecting department will be

placed under the management of a scientifically qualified member of the
staff, who will be especially engaged for this purpose. This official will
direct his attention to the investigation of the fauna, and with this object
in viev«- will resume the keeping of the various lists and records bearing
on these enquiries, which have unfortunately been interrupted for some

time, since the previous official by whom they were undertaken left the

--station.
     Preserved Specimens. The number of prepared specimens sent out

during the past year has considerably increased in comparison with the

previous year. Experiments in new methods of preservation are continu-

ally prosecuted, and most satisfactory results are constantly being attained.

Mention may here be made that the station is represented in the Inter-
national Fisheries Exhibition, now being held in London, by a collection
of these preparations ; and of these it may be said impartially that never

has a fauna furnished a more perfect, and at the same time more beautifully

--preserved, series of organisms.
     Microscopic Preparations. The demand for microscopic preparations
has diminished in comparison with last year. As this branch of the

Institution has hitherto failed to a certain extent to fulfil the expectations
originally entertained, the attitude of the Directorate in respect thereto

is at present of a somewhat passive nature, and it will be a subject for
enquiry and ultimate decision whether this department can be further
developed, and, if still maintained, whether any reform is necessary to

promote its efiiciency.

   --The Aquarium. The aquarium continues to be an important means

of enlisting the sympathy and interest of the general public in behalf of
the station and the biological sciences. To attain this end nothing is
left undone which can be undertaken without prejudice to the establish-
ment in general.

     During the course of the past year an English ' Guide ' has been
added to those already existing in the German, French, and Italian
languages ; and an atlas, comprising 250 figures of the most interesting
animals, which will supplement the ' Guides,' is at present in the

press.

     The number of visitors to the Aquarium is as great as in previous

years.

  --The Publications of the Station. The various works undertaken by the

station show steady progress.

     1. Of the ' Fauna und Flora des Golfes von Neapel ' the following
monographs have been published :

The plates of several of these monographs ai'e in the hands of the-

lithographer, and the printing of the text of Dr. Lang's monogi-aph has

already commenced. This latter will appear before the close of the year.

The number of monographs announced for following years has increased,

and besides those previously mentioned there are in preparation mono-

graphs on Radiolaria, Spongia, Siphonophora, Gorgoniida3, Amphictenidae,

Polygordius, Copepoda pelagica, Amphipoda.

3. The ' Zoologischer Jahresbericht.' The division of the ' Jahres-

bericht ' into four sections, which was adopted in 1880, has been retained

--for the 1881 'Bericht,' and the whole will occupy about the same bulk,
   namely, over 1,200 jjp. The number of referees engaged in the work

has been  augmented                                                      and  Professor J.  V.  Carus,  who  edited the vols,  for
                                                                      ;

1879-80, has made over the editing of the second section (Arthropoda)

to Dr. P. Mayer. The first three sections of the ' Bericht ' for 1883 are in

the press, and will appear in the course of some months. The whole

--' Bericht ' for 1 883 will be edited by the zoological station.
     The Lihrarij. The library, as in previous years, has been augmented

by presentations from authors, from several publishers, and from a

number of scientific institutions, as well as by numerous purchases.

Furthermore, a great number of new journals have been procured on

account of the ' Jahresbericht.'

The publication of a supplement to the library catalogue is deferred

this year, as it will be desirable to issue a complete catalogue next year.

  --The British Association Table. During the past year the Association

table has been used by Mr. J. T. Cunningham, Avhose occupancy extended

over a term of six months, by special j^ermission of your Committee.

The report which Mr. Cuuningliam has furnished of his investigations is

appended beloAv. Tbe usual lists and detailed infoi-mation courteously

supplied by the staS' of the zoological station are also apjaended.

    Two applications for the use of the table during the coming year have

been received by the Committee, and from both of the applicants work

of an important character may be anticipated.

With the present facts before them, and every assurance of the con-

tinued utility of the Association table, and of the advantages afforded by

it to British naturalists, your Committee strongly recommend the renewal

of the grant.
                             ON THE ZOOLOGICAL STATION AT NAPLES.                     237

I. "Report on the Occupation of the Table l>j Mr. J. T. Cunningham.

     I arrived at Naples on Sunday, November 5, 1882. The Committee

of the British Association had, in accordance Avith my request, kindly

given me permission to occupy their table for six months. Everything
was ready for me to commence work at once, and during the whole of my

stay I had more and more cause to admire the perfection of the workino-

arrangements of the station and the courtesy and care with which the

staff provided for the wants of the numerous zoologists at work in the

laboratory.

I went to Naples with the intention of working out certain points in

the anatomy of the Mollnsca, and if possible of obtaining some light on

their phylogenetic history by a study of their organogeny. These

matters occupied the greater part of my time, although I of course

availed myself of the unique opportunities of the station for the study of

marine forms in general, and of many cases of development. For

example, I studied the artificial fertilisation and subsequent development

of species of Echinoidea, and spent many hours over the Radiolaria,

MedusEe, Siphonophora, and numerous larval forms which occur in

bewildering profusion in the product of the surface-collecting, known in

the station as ' Auftrieb.'

I also took up to a certain extent the anatomy of the Gephyreans and

of the Siphonostomata, in order to compare the former with the forms

most nearly approaching them among the Chtetopoda. In the anatomy

of Siphonostoma and of Stylarioides I found there were several interest-

ing points for investigation, and I was sorry that I could not make my

researches on them more complete.

One of the points in molluscan anatomy which I succeeded in working

out was the relation of the renal organs to the pericardium in Patella : I
found that each renal organ had an independent opening into the peri-

cardial cavity. I also studied the form, relations, and histology of the

kidney (triangular gland) in the genus Aplysia, and prepared a descrip-

tion of the organ for the * Mittheilangen ' of the station.

For the development of the organs in Mollusca I took nearly all the

material I could get, including the ova of the Cephalopoda. I found it

extremely difficult to obtain satisfactory preparations which would clear
up the doubtful points in the organogeny either of the Cephalopoda or

the Gastei'opoda, which were the two groups I chiefly studied. Up to

the time I left Naples I had not obtained any definite results.

I gave up the table a few days before the end of April 1883 ; it is

with much pleasure that 1 thank the Committee for the privilege they

granted  me                  the  period of  my occupation of  the  table  was  most  agree-
                          ;

able and profitable to me.

I must also express here my deep indebtedness to the kindness and

friendly support which I received from Dr. Dohrn and all the other
members of the staff of the station. I was permitted to accompany

collecting expeditions and to become familiar with the "vthole organisation
and working of the laboratory and aquarium. The station is an immense

advantage to zoology in general and to all European zoologists, and the

Association deserves the gi-atitude of English biologists for holding a

table in its laboratory.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. Pye-Smith, Professor

   DE Chaumont, Dr. M. Foster, and Dr. Burdon Sanderson

   {Secretary), reappointed for the purpose of investigating the
   Influence of Bodily Exercise on the EUiinination of Nitrogen

   (the experinients conducted by Mr. North). Drawn up by Mr.

   North.

In my last Keport I stated tbat the work machine, for which I was

granted 50Z. at the York meeting, had just been delivered by the makers,

and expressed a hope that in my next report I might be able to give the

results of experiments with it. I regret that unforeseen circumstances

have prevented me from making trial of it in experiments upon the

elimination of nitrogen, but that the whole of the past year has been

spent in remedying defects, and materially altering the machine in many-

ways.

The principle on which the machine was constructed seems in every

respect to be satisfactory, but several very serious difficulties have had to

be overcome before it could in any sense be said to be complete and ready

for work.

Firstly, the original arrangement for supporting the body during the

progress of the work was found to be unsuited to its purpose, and another

arrangement was, after many trials, adopted. This appears to be satisfac-

tory, and to give such a power of adjusting the position of the body with

regard to the work as is required.

Secondly, the buffer on to which the weight fell was found to require

modification, the chief reason being the great noise which the sudden

stoppage of the weight caused. After considering carefully various forms of

-- --buffer air, hydraulic, and spring I finally adopted the simple expedient

of an iron anvil weighing 140 pounds, covered at the top with two inches

--of rubber. This serves two purposes firstly, to deaden the sound, which

it does to a very considerable extent ; and secondly, to give stability to

the part of the machine in which it is placed.

Thirdly, it was found necessary to raise the cam and pulley on an

iron box, there not being otherwise sufficient room for the play of the

weight.

Fourthly, to strengthen and support the self-releasing gear by means

of gun-metal guides. This was a most important improvement, and

greatly added to the efficiency of the machine.

    Fifthly, to substitute a wire rope for the hemp one originally used,

which broke at every trial, and when a heavier one was tried was found
to stretch so much as to render the releasing gear useless, and ultimately

to break. The use of a wire rope necessitated the ase of specially

constructed ' strainers ' for adjusting it. After several apparently very

satisfactory trials one of these broke, and from the great sti'ain upon it

the recoil of the rope was nearly the cause of what might have been a very

Aserious accident.  new one was constructed and fresh trials were made,

with the result that the rope broke again two or three times, without any

very apparent reason. I ultimately discovered that the momentum,

imparted to the heavy cam by the sudden descent of the weight, caused

a very great and very sudden strain to be put upon the rope in one
ON THE ANCIENT EAKTHWORK IN EPPING FOREST.  243

particular place, and that this was aggravated by its being at the same
time and by the same means brought into very violent contact with the

sharp edge of the pulley. This, after several operations, resulted in the

rope being seriously damaged and so weakened that the next trial broke
it. This diflSculty has been remedied by the introduction of a sort of

self-acting brake, so that I hope the mechanical diflBculties are now

overcome.

    In conclusion, whilst expressing my thanks for the assistance which
has been afforded me in procuring what I believe to be a very necessary

machine for investigations on the external work of the body, I ask that

my Committee may be reappointed, without further grant of money, for

the ensuing year.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr. R. Meldola, Greneral
   PiTT-EivERS, Mr. WoRTHiNGTON Smith, and Mr. William Cole,

   appointed to investigate the Ancient Earthivorh in Epping
   Forest, known as the ' Loughton ' or ' Coivpers ' Camp.

                                       [Plates II. and III.]

In ancient times an immense forest probably covered the greater part of
the county of Essex, and, as a remnant of this vast tract of woodland,
the present Epping or Waltham Forest possesses very considerable interest
to the naturalist and antiquary. Although in the progress of agriculture
the county generally has become highly cultivated, the stringency of the
old forest laws, and the various rights of cattle-feeding and wood-cutting
in more recent times, have effectually combined to check enclosures and
clearing, and to preserve to Epping Forest many of the characteristics of
a primitive woodland. The soil in most of the woods has remained un-
disturbed within historic times, except in a few spots where local gravel-
pits have been opened. It is not surprising, therefore, that relics of
former conditions of life should still exist in the forest, undefaced except
through the action of natural agencies ; but until very recently the
district has not received from archaeologists the attention it desei'ves, and
it is more than probable that further traces of prehistoric occupation will
yet reward the persevering explorer. At the present time the forest is
known to '^ntain two ancient earthworks or camps, which are of more
than ordinai_y interest, being perhaps the best preserved examples of such
structures in the immediate neighbourhood of London. One, locally
called ' Ambresbury,' ' Amesbury,' or ' Ambers ' Banks, is situated in the
forest about 1^ miles south-west of the town or village of Epping Street,
and about a hundred yards to the right of the road to Epping, which
was made early in the sixteenth century. This position rendering it

easy of discovery, the Ambresbury Camp has long been known, and the

meagre and unsatisfactory details usually given of such remains are to be
read in the local histories. In 1881 the Essex Field Club carried on
some explorations at Ambresbury Banks, a report upon which, drawn up
by General Pitt-Rivers, was read at the York Meeting of the British
Association,' and published in extenso in the ' Transactions ' of the Club

                                              ' Brit. Assoc. Report, 1881, p. 697.

(vol. ii. p. 55), with plans of the camp constructed by Mr. D'Oyley, and

coloured figures of the objects found. These relics, consisting of small

fragments of very rude pottery and a few flint 'flakes,' determined the

camp, in the opinion of General Pitt- Rivers, to be of British or Romano-

British construction, but the data obtained were insufficient to fix the

age of the entrenchment with greater precision.

       The second entrenchment, now called the ' Loughton ' or ' Cowper's

Camp, remained unknown nntil it was discovered by the acumen and

perseverance of Mr. B. H. Cowper. Mr. Cowper thus recounts the cir-

--cumstances attending his recognition of the camp : ' In the course of my

researches in the forest, I came, in the summer of 1872, into the neigh-

bourhood of Loughton. There it was that I suddenly detected what

Aappeared to be a portion of a moated enclosure.      short investigation

was then all that I could make, but I was convinced of the reality of the

conjecture. I made some inquiries, but failed to discover any record or

local knowledge of a camp in that portion of the forest, and there the

matter ended for the time. In 1875 I returned, and after several eSbrts

managed to complete the circuit of the camp, which was a difficult

operation. I gave as much publicity as possible to the discovery, and in
addition went over all the ground between the Loughton Camp and

Ambresbury Banks. Friends took an interest in the matter, and foremost

among them was Mr. W. D'Oyley, who rendered the greatest service and

accomplished a complete survey of both the ancient earthworks.' By

means of this discovery Mr. Cowper rendered an important service to

the knowledge of the archaeology of the forest district, and in his various

papers on the subject, the titles of which are here recorded, he gave a

careful description of the earthwork and its surroundings, and compared

it with the neighbouring Ambresbury Banks. Mr. Cowper's writings on

the subject are as follows : (1) ' Notes on an Entrenched Camp in Epping

Forest, with plan by Mr. D'Oyley ; ' read at a meeting of the Royal

Archfeological Institute, November 5, 1875 ; ' (2) ' Ancient Earthworks

acknowledge our indebtedness to these papers for many details. Mr.

D'Oyley's labours in the delineation of the two camps call also for

grateful recognition, inasmuch as they materially aided the explorations

which were afterwards undertaken.

       The Loughton Camp is situated about a mile north of the village

from whence it takes its name, and about two miles south-west of

Ambresbury Banks. It is placed in the depths of the forest, the trees

surrounding and covering it being principally beech and oak ; some very
ancient specimens of the former tree actually grow upon the ramparts,

and many old hollies are to be found both within and around the

entrenchments. Its circumference is about 800 yards, giving a contents

of between 11 and 12 acres ; the two known forest camps being very

nearly of a size. The construction of the camp is also very similar to

that of the Ambresbury entrenchment, an outer broad ditch having been

dug, and the earth so obtained thrown up on the inside to form a rampart.

         ON THE ANCIENT EAETHWOEK IN EPPING FOREST.  245

In the report on the Ambresbury Banks allusion was made to the some-
what irregular lines of the fortification as contrasted with those of camps
of known Roman origin. In the Loughton Camp strict symmetry of
proportion has been completely disregarded by its constructors, and there
are scarcely any defined angles (see Plate II.). The form of the camp
is that of an imperfect oval, and the lines of the rampart appear to follow
and to have been controlled by the natural contours of the ground. It

has suffered to a much greater degree than Ambresbury Banks from

the effects of age and denudation. In many places the burrowings of
foxes and rabbits have caused much damage, increased possibly, in some
instances, by foresters in digging out the animals, or even in removing

sand in very modern times. In one place in particular, on the western
side, the bank and trench have nearly disappeared, the soil having ap-

parently literally tumbled down the slope of the valley, a result probably

due to natural agencies, this being a very exposed part of the fortifica-

Wetion.  are sorry to report that in the course of the construction of a

recently designed ' Green Ride ' through the forest, a considerable portion

of the western glacis has been cut away, and the original appearance of

the rampart at that spot completely destroyed.

     The position of the camp is remarkable ; and, considered from a mili-
tary point of view, it ^s perhaps the most advantageous in the whole
forest district. It occupies the southern headlapd of an elevated plateau,,
many parts of which are densely wooded. Prom the southern side of the

camp an extensive view may be had looking towards the south-east,
bounded by the Kentish hills beyond tbe Thames. The Lea Valley to
the west is shut out by the long ridge forming High Beech, which is
higher than the ground occupied by the camp. At the northern angle
of the camp the elevation is about 310 feet above the Ordnance datum.

The ground gradually trends away towards the southern rampart, and
then suddenly dips down to Debden Slade, a low marshy valley distant

about 1,000 feet to the south (Plate 11.), the level of which is only
160 feet above datum, showing a fall of about 120 feet from the southern

aspect of the camp, or 150 feet from the higher plateau-ground at the

northern end. From the western side the ground descends even more

abruptly, to form a smaller valley, the levels showing a fall of about

70 feet. This valley falls to the south to join Debden Slade. From the

north-west corner of the camp the higher ground forms a headland to this

valley, and is continued for a distance equal to about half the length of
the camp into a spur towards the south. This tongue of land, being
some 10 feet higher than the western rampart, and running almost

parallel with it, may possibly have been originally included in the plan

of the fortification but any evidences of entrenchment have probably
                                                                                                       ;

suffered so much from recent gravel diggings, that no safe conclusions-

can be drawn therefrom. Mr. Cowper, however, thought he could trace
a lower trenching round the head of the valley, continuing for some

distance along the crest of the spur.

    The high plateau-ground from which this spur springs is continued
round the northern and north-eastern corners of the camp. The ground
then descends by the eastern side into a swamp at the south-east corner,
and eventually trends away into the deep valley, Debden Slade, before

mentioned, the rampart itself sweeping with a gentle curve until its

outlines are lost in the slopes of the morass.
     This little ' morass ' (which is a piece of true bog-land, containing-
246 REPOET-- 1883.

Sphagnum, Hypericum elodes, and other marsh-loving plants) occupies a

small valley, which leads up into the interior of the camp. At the spot

T?here the bog seems to originate is a small circular fit, which has every
appearance of being a water-well of artificial construction. At present,

however, we have no direct evidence to connect this well with the
original makers of the camp. It is now choked with leaves, &c., but it

still appears to supply water to feed the bog, the quantity being largely

augmented in winter and spring by the surface drainage from the higher

ground at the northern part of the camp. The ridge of ground on which the

rampai't runs somewhat contracts the limits of the bog at the north-west

corner of the camp, and a little outside the line of entrenchments a bank

can easily be recognised running across the morass, leaving a narrow

' gate ' or floodway towards the east. This bank is perhaps the remnant

of an ancient dam, by which a head of water could have been retained in

the interior of the camp for the use of the inhabitants, a constant supply

being furnished by the artificial ' well ' before noticed. These statements
must be put forward somewhat hypothetically ; no cutting has yet been
made through the ' dam,' nor has the ' well ' been explored, and conse-

quently the evidence is wanting which would conclusively prove these

structures to be coeval with the canij) itself. But they are, nevertheless,

very interesting, and cannot be passed over in any description of the

place.

    Two well-defined, and perhaps old, entrances exist at the northern

--end of the camp, through one of which a ' driftway ' runs a very hard

and good path, which leaves the camji by an outlet at the southern slope

Ato descend to Debden Slade, and so to Longhton.                                  good and old path,

branching out from the first, runs outside the northern and eastern ram-

parts also to Loughton. The three inlets to the camp appear to be
ancient, but at present we have no means of fixing their age relatively to

the ramparts.

Several pits of varying size exist in the camp, and they are numerous

on the high-level ground, stretching from the head of the little valley on

the west round the northern aspect of the ramparts. It is possible that

some of these pits may owe their origin to the exertions of sand-seekers
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

but many of them must be of considerable antiquity, as they are densely

overgrown with trees, and we are disposed to think that these at least
may have been constructed by the occupiers of the camp, and have had

some connection with their habits of life. The regular circular form of

some of these pits, and the distance of the site of the camp from any high

road (for the present Bpping New Road is, of course, very modern), by

which vehicles could reach this densely-wooded district, are circumstances

sufficient to throw grave doubt upon the suggestion that they were made

Aby gravel-diggers.                            cutting was made in one of the pits within the

camp                                  and  in  the silt, about 2 feet  down,  an  artificial black flint flake,
                                   ;

perfectly unweathered, was found (No. 38). It is hoped that some fur-

ther examination of these pits may be made, pending which any hypo-

theses as to their age or probable uses must necessarily be little more

than guesswork.

Mr. Cowper has called attention to some banks on the ground

between the Ambresbury and Loughton Camps, and similar works have

recently been detected on the high ridge by the ' King's Oak,' to the

west of the Loughton Camp. Owing to the denseness of the forest, an

accurate survey of these banks would be somewhat difficult, and it has

Wenot yet been attempted.        are, therefore, not in a position to describe

them more definitely, but they are certainly artificial, and would seem to

deserve a thorough examination. Mr. D'Oyley also directed our attention

to a somewhat remarkable configuration of the ground at one spot in the

deep valley to the south-east of the camp. The footpath leading thither

from the camp is, at almost its lowest point, flanked by several very

A* mound-like ' ridges of soil, densely covered with vegetation.  section

was cut thi-ough one of these, but no signs of artificial construction were

discoverable. It is probable that they are purely natural formations, caused

by the erosive action of the surface water flowing down rapidly from the

higher ground which the camp occupies in sufficient quantity and force
to wear away the lighter soil, and so leave these ridges of denser clay

standing boldly out above the general level.

The above sketch comprises the information at present in our posses-

sion concerning the external features and natural surroundings of the

Loughton Camp, and we now proceed to detail the results of the diggings

into the ramparts. The investigations were carried on under tlie auspices

of the Essex Field Club by a sub-committee of that society including all
the members of the present committee, the necessary funds being sub-

scribed by members of the club, supplemented by a gi-ant of lOL from

the Council of the British Association. Permission having been granted
by the Epping Forest Committee of the Corporation of London, the work

was commenced on May 29, 1882, and continued until June 14, the

removal of the earth being very carefully watched by members of the

joint committee, under the direction of the hon. secretary, Mr. W. Cole,
Mr. W. D'Oyley also kindly giving his services as surveyor. The mode

of working both in theory and practice was so fully explained by General

Pitt-Kivers in his report upon Ambresbmy Banks,' that it is unnecessary

to repeat the details here. Sections were cut through the rampart and

ditch so as to expose the ' old surface line,' or the original floor of earth

upon which the soil dug out in making the fosse was heaped by the con-
structors of the camp to raise up the ramparts. The earth being generally

of a more sandy nature than at Ambresbury Banks the sieve could be freely

used, and each spadeful was sifted on its removal and carefully examined

for relics, the position of each object found being registered on working

drawings of the cuttings. The contract for the work was taken by Mr.

Cuthbert, of Loughton, and a word of praise is due to our four workmen,
who displayed great care and intelligence in the somewhat tedious and

delicate tasks set before them.

The position of the cuttings is shown on the plan of the camp. The

first was 12 feet in width, and it was carried from the foot of the silting

of the interior slope on for 80 feet through the rampart and ditch to the

counterscarp. The camp at this part has suS'ered severely from denudation,
owing to the light nature of the soil. As will be seen by an inspection

of the plan of the cutting (Plate III.), the present height of the rampart

is only about 5 feet 6 inches above the ' old surface line,' and the ditch is
filled up with silt to the depth of about 6 feet. In this first section the
silting was so similar in appearance to the undisturbed earth, that the

outline of the fosse could not be followed out with any certainty, and
even the escarp was very difficult to trace.

percussion' and three 'facets." Found beneath the silt at the foot of

interior slope, with charcoal and burnt stones, a considerable quantity of
which were turned up by the spades from the 'old-surface line' spit for

about 20 feet from the commencement of the cutting. Near a deposit of

charcoal three flint flakes (No. 2) and two ' cores' from which flakes had
been struck ('H') were found.

shape, the largest about 2 inches by I'o inches and about 05 inch thick.

They are dull red in colour, somewhat darker on the smoother or interior

surface, and quite blackish in the middle of the paste, owing to imperfect

firing. The te.x^ture is very coarse, the pottery containing angular pieces

of quartz and coloured pebble of comparatively considerable size, with

sand. It is decidedly hand-made, and probably of British manufacture.

fllope of rampart, about 2^ feet down.

Nos. 9 and 10. Flint ' core ' and flake with many ' facets,' both un-

"weathered                                                           found in extei-ior slope of rampart, about 2 feet down.

No. 11. Flint ' core,' from which flakes have been struck ; found about

oh feet down in the silt accumulated in the fosse.

The indistinctness of the outlines of the ditch, and the paucity of the

evidence above obtained, rendered another cutting necessary, and a new

one, seven feet wide, was commenced on June 8 through the vallum near

the south-west corner of the camp. The line of junction between the
made earth, silt, and the original surface, was here more clearly traceable,

and could be laid down with tolerable accuracy upon the plan, except the

commencement of the escarp, concerning the exact angle of which some

little doubt was felt. On clearing out the fosse, in which 6^ feet of silt

had accumulated, its forra was found to be pointed, as was the case at

Ambresbury, The soil at the bottom of the ditch was quite jieaty, and

water rose in the cutting for a foot or two. The rampart is now only

about six feet above the old level of the earth, and its angles are so altered
by severe ' weathering' that its original form is not recoverable. In this

second section (Plate III., fig. 2) the following objects were found :
     Nos. 12, 13, and 14. Tlu-ee good pointed flakes, showing good ' bulbs '

and several ' facets,' two of greyish, and one of reddish coloured fliiit,^

unweathered. Found with the following :

Nos. 15, 10, and 18. About two dozen flint flakes, with bulbs of per-

cussion, and some exhibiting one or more ' facets,' all quite unweathered ;

found with Nos. 12 and 13, and other flakes and chips, large quantities of
charcoal, burnt stones, &c., near foot of intei-ior slope of rampart, about
two feet from surface. There were evident signs of a large fire at this
spot, around which the flakes were scattered.

     No. 19. Good black flint flake, unweathered ; found further in the
rampart than the last, but also near abundant traces of charcoal, burnt
stones and ashes.

No.  20.  Flint celt, somewhat  roughly chipped                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           about  5  inches  long,
                                                                                                                        ;

and 1-5 inches broad, with worked chisel-like ends, and one side chipped

into an acute edge, the other being obtuse. Perhaps not finished, but

unweathei-ed. Found well beneath the body of the rampart, about 4 feet

down (see infra, p. 250).

Nos. 21, 22, and 23. Five flint flakes, with ' bulbs ' and two or more

' facets,' found well under the crest of the rampart, and considerably above

the old surface line.

No pottery was found in the second section, although every possible

care was taken that even the smallest fragments should not be passed over.

General Pitt- Rivers examined the ground and the objects obtained, but

he and the other members of the Committee were of opinion that further

evidence should be sought for before any safe conclusion could be arrived

Aat as to the period of the camp.  third cutting was therefore commenced

on August 14, the spot selected being a good piece of rampart near the

south-east corner of the camp. This cutting was 8 feet wide, but as the
escarp was thickly covered with large trees, and the form of the ditch had

been determined in the second section, it was not considered necessary to
incur the expense of carrying the trench beyond the crest of the rampart,

about 26 feet from the base of the interior slope. The old surface of the
earth was readily recognised, and was found to take a deep downward

slope, so that the ' made earth ' of the rampart, although externally

apparently greatly denuded, was at least G feet thick at the deepest part.
The following objects were found in this cutting (Plate III., fig. 3) :

    Nos. 24 and 35. Flint ' core,' artificial splinter, and flake. °Found in

interior slope of rampart, about 15 feet from commencement of cutting,
and about 2 feet from the surface.

     No. 25. Flint ' core,' found in crest of ram25art, about 18 inches from

the surface.

Nos. 27 to 32. Twelve pieces of pottery, varying in size from 2-5 inches

by 1-5 inches to quite small fragments, all being about 0-3 inch thick.

This pottery is of superior quality to that found in No. 1 cutting. It is

thinner, harder, and is formed of a sandy clay with no grains of quartz or

pebbles in the paste. The colour is dull reddish-brown on the surface,

but a blackish tint obtains in the centre, the result of imperfect firing.

The curved form of most of the fragments shows that they belonged

to circular vessels, and two of the pieces have ' rims,' somewhat rudely

modelled, which project about 01 inch. There are no signs of lathe

Aturning, and the pottery was doubtless handmade.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         black flint flake
was found near No. 30. All the pieces came from well within the interior

slope, about 2^ feet from the surface of the rampart.

No. 33. Two flakes, one with three or four ' facets ; ' and No. 34, a long

slender flake, having good ' bulb ' and many facets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       all unweathered, and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

from well under the crest of the rampart.
A fourth cutting was made longitudinally into the same piece of

rampart, at the point where it slopes away into the morass, at the south-
250 REPORT--1883.

east corner, above described. This trench was 6 feet broad, and about

14 feet long (see Plate III., fig. 4) ; in it were only found

   ANo. 36. small fragment of pottery, seemingly a portion of the base

of a rudely-made vessel, in qualitj' not distinguishable from Nos. 27-

A32. Near old surface, about 2 feet from surface of i-ampart.  small

flint flake was found with it, and another (No. 37) further up the cutting,

both unweathered.

     The number of flint flakes in the rampart of this camp is somewhat
large in proportion to the amount of material excavated. Many flakes of

a ruder class than those catalogued, artificial splinters of flint, and rude

'cores,' have not been kept.

     The flakes are all as sharp as on the day they were struck off', only
one showing signs of use (No. 8 b) ; they all have the ' cone of percus-
sion,' are lusti'ous, and the flints from which they were made belonged to

the local gi'avel deposits. Several exhibit small ferruginous concretions

upon them.

     The discovery of a large number of flakes, and a quantity of burnt
wood and burnt stones in one position in the second cutting (vide Nos.
16-18) seems to point (as was first suggested by Mr. H. A. Cole who was

watching the excavations at the time) to the presence of a camp fire at

that spot, round which fire the occupiers sat and made their weapons and
tools of flint. This idea was confirmed by the fact of several flakes

Laving been manifestly struck off" from the same block of flint. After a

hasty examination of the flakes from this position, Mr. Worthington

Smith speedily replaced one flake on to a second somewhat larger one
from which it had been originally struck : when replaced, a flat basal end
belonging to the core was indicated by the truncated ends of the two

flakes.

    Among the flakes was a rude but cleverly chipped flint chisel or

celt (No. 20), not polished in any pai't, but exhibiting traces of the
original ' crust ' or ' bark ' of the flint in one or two positions. This
instrument is of somewhat remarkable form, one side edge being acute,
and the other flat, and some doubt exists as to whether it was really

intentionally chipped into its present shape, or whether it is simply un-

finished on one side. Mr. Smith remarks, ' If this instrument is really
a chisel meant to be held unmounted in the hand, and the broad end

designed for use, the obtuse end makes it convenient for handling, as the
thumb of the right hand naturally rests on that edge.'

    No other implements were found in the excavations, and this is not

remarkable, as unless they were found in the bottom of the ditch they

were hardly likely to be found in the rampart they could only get there
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

by accident during its erection.
     The number, position, and unweathered condition of the flakes seems

to indicate that they were struck off" at the time the camp was made, and
that the makers of the structure used flint tools, but we put forward this
suggestion with diffidence, as great caution is necessary in making deduc-
tions from the evidence at present in our possession, and we beg leave to

refer to General Pitt-Rivers' separate opinion on this point given here-

·with.

Flakes, of course, are the waste splinters of flint struck off in the manu-

facture of tools, and were esteemed only as rubbish by the tool-makers.

--The question now is Where are the finished tools which were produced

'by the flaking ? Judging from what we know of other camps, and from
on THE ANCIENT EARTHWORK IN EPPING FOREST.  251

the fact that a body of men, who perhaps used stone weapons and tools,

probably lived inside the camp, it is not nnreasonable to suppose that

finished tools may be found within the space enclosed by the ramparts, if
the original floor be exposed by the removal of a foot or two of the humus
by which it is now covered. In this position celts, arrow-heads, ' scrapers,'
'knives,' 'fabricators,' and other tools might be found, as we find them
in the soil of other camps when the interior is disturbed by the plough.

     Although none of the specimens appear to precisely agree in quality
and texture with those found in Ambresbury Banks, still, as in that earth-

work, the pottery of the Loughton Camp may be divided into two classes.

The first is of a very coarse manufacture, the clay containing fragments
of quartz and pebble ; the other is thinner, of finer material, harder and
closer in texture, and without the angular stony grains. Both classes
are manifestly insufl&ciently fired, and all the specimens are hand-
made. They have been submitted to Mr. A. W. Franks, F.R.S., of
the British Museum, who points out the great difficulty of accurately
estimating the age of 'rude pottery where no ornamentation is present

to afibrd a clue, and where only small fragments are available for

determination. He is, however, disposed to rank the potsherds found as

of late Celtic age and manufacture. The pottery and flints have also been
carefully examined by General Pitt- Rivers, who has written a report upon
th&m, which we give in his own words :

     ' I regret much that the pressure of other business has prevented me,

excepting on one occasion, from being present at the excavations of the

Loughton Camp ; but I have examined the specimens found in the cut-

tings, and very carefully preserved and ticketed by Mr. Cole.
     ' The pottery found in the first section on the old surface line, and in

the body of the rampart, is of the coarse kind, with some large grains of
some foreign material intermixed, which is commonly found in the ram-

parts of British camps. The pottery of the third and fourth cuttings is
of a superior quality, without large grains, and apparently better baked

but the vessels had small irregular rims, and tliere is, I think, sufficient
evidence upon them to show that they were hand-made, and not lathe-
turned. Pottery of these two qualities not unfrequently occur together
in British camps. There is no ornamentation to positively identify any

of the fragments as late Celtic ; but, judging from the results of other

excavations, I see no reason why they should not be of that period. I

should certainly consider them pre-Roman.
     ' With respect to the flint flakes found in the body of the rampart

and on the " old-surface line," I do not consider the presence of flakes in
these positions to afford positive proof that they were in use at the time
of the construction of the camp. There are many spots on the surface of

hills in which, if a rampart were to be thrown up noio and explored at
some future time, both the old surface line and the body of the rampart
would be found to contain numerous flakes, the remains of earlier occu-

pation by prehistoric man. I have also quite recently found the old

surface line of a rampart thickly strewed with flakes, while other cuttings

in the same rampart have shown evidence that the camp was of a more
recent date than that in which flint tools were used. The comparative
freshness of the flakes, however, although it may to some extent be attri-
buted to the sandy nature of the soil, appears to me to favour the opinion
that they were struck oS" and covered up soon after ; and the finding of
several fragments fitting one another confirms this view, as noticed by
252 REPORT-- 1883.

Mr. Worthington Smith. The discovery of a half-formed flint celt also

appears to me to corroborate this opinion.
     ' On the whole, therefore, judging from the specimens Mr. Cole has

been good enough to show me, I think the evidence is suflBcient to iden-
tify the camp as pre-Roman, and probably of very early period.'

     In conclusion, we may be permitted to point out that the whole

 evidence brought forward in this report agrees well with the theory of s,

British origin of the camp. Its irregular outlines, and the way in which

the ramparts were adapted to the form of the hill on which it is placed,
are characteristics of British methods of castrametation. The V-shaped
section of the fosse is, as was pointed out by General Pitt- Rivers in his
Report on the Ambresbury Banks, a very noteworthy feature, and an
exceptional one, in British camps, so far as our knowledge extends ; the-
ditches in the camps at Cissbury, Cabnm, and Seaford were all flat-
bottomed. The worn appearance of Loughton Camp, and the immense-

amount of denudation apparent in many places, favours the idea that it
may be of earlier date than Ambresbury Banks, although both are of
British workmanship. Whether their constructors used flint tools in
ordinary life cSn only be satisfactorily determined by means of further
explorations, both in the ramparts and within the enclosures. The

numerous pits in the Loughton Camp, and the ground around the sup.
posed ' well,' also deserve attention. The extended examination of these-
earthworks and the other prehistoric remains in the forest is a matter

not only of scientific importance, but also of very considerable popular

interest to all inhabitants of London and its environs, who have now,
thanks to the Corporation, a sort of personal lien upon its many attrac-
tions. No better or more permanently useful work can engage the

energies of local scientific societies than an endeavour to gain and place
on record some definite and accurate information respecting such pre-

historic antiquities as may still exist in their neighboui'hoods ; and we
hope that the Essex Field Club may soon be placed in a position to-

continue the inquiry on the lines pointed out, which have already given
such interesting results.

     The Committee has great pleasure in thanking the Corporation of
London for permission to explore the camp, and Mr. D'Oyley, the hon-

surveyor to the Essex Field Club, Mr. R. L. Barnes, Mr. W. H. Bird,.
Mr. A. W. Franks, Captain McKenzie, Mr. J. Spiller, Mr. C. Thomas,

and Keeper Pearce, and others, for kind aid afibrded during the progress
of the work.

     1. The Committee, oi-iginally appointed in 1875, and aided by succes-
sive grants, of which it has expended 280Z., has made a Report in each of
the five years 1878 to 1882, and now submits its final Report.

     2. Not that the work open to the Committee is exhausted, although it

has to a great extent supplied what was pointed out in its Reports of

1881 and 1882 as chiefly wanting, or that its conclusions are to its own
mind complete and satisfactory. But it would require more time and

larger funds than are at the disposal of the Committee to prosecute its

inquiries, even with the materials now in its possession, to the end which
it has had in view ; and the Committee is of opinion that the most useful

course will be to bring before the Association the results of its past
labours, indicating at the same time the conclusions which it considers to

be sufficiently established by the facts ascertained, and the deficiencies,
both of data and methods, which remain to be supplemented, either by

individual exertion, or by the reappointment of a similar Committee at
some future period under the auspices of the Association.

3. In order to furnish a complete review of the information obtained,

it will be necessary to refer to tables and data contained in previous
Areports.
             list of these Reports is furnished in a note.^

4', The Committee was appointed for the purpose of collecting obser-

vations on the systematic examination of the height, weight, and other

physical characters of the inhabitants of the British Isles.

5. Its operations in each year are described in the introduction to its

Report of 1881. The description and amount of the statistics which it

has collected, and the names of the persons to whom it is indebted for

the collection, are detailed chiefly at the commencement of its several

Reports from 1880 to 1882.

    6. Among the objects early aimed at by the Committee, and prose-

cuted by it up to the year 1881, was the collection and comparison of

photographs  of   the  typical  races  of  the  United  Kingdom                                                but  at  the

meeting of that year this inquiry was assigned to a separate Committee,

upon whom will devolve the duty of reporting upon this branch of the

general subject.

     7. The points to which the Committee has addressed                                              its inquiries

are

     (1) Stature.

     (2) Weight.

     (3) Girth of chest.

     (4) Colour of eyes 1 ri    i·

     (5) ,,_ 4ir}_^°°^P^^^^°^-

     (6) Breathing capacity.

     (7) Strength of arm.

     (8) Sight.

     (9) Span of arms.

     To these might have been added others, especially

     (10) Size and shape of head.
     (11) Length of lower limbs as shown by the difference between

                   the sitting and standing positions.

     (12) Girth, length, and breadth of other parts of the body.

But the Committee was afraid of seeking to obtain more information

than their contributors would   be likely  to furnish                                                and experience has
                                                                                                  ;

shown tha.t many of them have been unable to supply more than a por-

tion of that which was requested. Few have furnished complete returns

on all the subjects, but where one has failed another has succeeded,

and sufficient data have been collected to give trustworthy statistical

results on all the subjects of inquiry except those of breathing capacity

and sight. An abstract of one of the complete returns will be given in

its proper place, as exhibiting a good epitome of what the Committee

has sought to obtain in all cases. (See Table XXIII.)

     8. The large body of observations on stature, weight, and complexion

collected by Dr. Beddoe, and those on stature, weight, and chest-girth

collected by Mr. Roberts, previously to the formation of the Committee,

have been made use of; and the Committee has thus had observations

made on a total number of about 53,000 individuals of both sexes and of

all ages, from which to construct their tables and to base their conclusions.

     9. The statistics are unique in I'ange and numbers, and have_^ been
obtained from a very large number of independent observers living in

different parts of the country, without prejudice, and often in ignorance of

the use which would be made of them ; and they have been analysed and

tabulated in a perfectly impartial manner, irrespective of a,ll preconceived

opinions. The Committee does not claim for them exemjstion from the

liability to that amount of imperfection and probable error which must

attach to all conclusions drawn from a disproportionate, and from a

comparatively small number of observations. But great care has been

taken in the examination and classification of all the returns to eliminate

obvious errors, and to call attention in the body of the Report to any

apparent discrepancies from faulty observation or deficient numbers.'

--' ' If an exceedingly large number of measurements, weights, &c. be taken sup-

--posing no bias, or any cause of error acting preferably in any one direction to exist
   not only will the number of small errors vastly exceed that of large ones, but the

results will be found to group themselves about the mean of the whole always accord-

ing to one invariable law of numbers, and that the more precisely, the greater the

total number of determinations  Rude and unskilful measurements of any

kind, accumulated in very great numbers, are competent to afEord precise mean

results. The only conditions are the continual auimiig mensiu-andi, the absence of

     10. The forms and instruments used have been explained in the

Reports     for  1878 and     1880                           but  practical      difficulties  have  been  found

to exist in obtaining trustworthy observations with regard to breathing

capacity. Experience has also led the Committee to believe that the use

of Snellen's test-types for sight, Nos. 1 and 10, is more convenient,

and will yield more trustworthy results, than that of the army test-dots,

which were adopted in its original circulars.' Since 1879, also, the Com-

mittee has introduced the use of cards for recording the observations
relating to single persons, which has been extensively adopted in Ger-

many and the United States, and recently by the Investigation Com-

mittee of the British Medical Association, and which offers great facilities
in analysing and grouping the facts observed. The Committee appends
copies of the forms of the cards and of the methods of measurement and
observation which they have employed. (See Appendix A.)

     11. The difference between the average and mean of a number of obser-

vations, and its importance in dealing with the subjects under considera-

tion, has been pointed out and discussed by Mr. Roberts in the Report

for  1881,  at p.  23.3    ^  and  the                       special  sense  in  which  Mr.    Roberts  employs

                         ;

the term mean, being that value in an arithmetic series of observed values

of which the observations are the most frequent, has been adopted by

the Committee.^

     12. In connection with the question of the applicability of the expo-

nential law of error to statistical results relating to anthropometry,

Mr. Francis Galton has contributed a valuable series of tables, with

remarks, on the range in height, weight, and strength, in which he

introduces his method of the calculation of deciles, quartiles, and

medians."*

bias, the correctness of the scale with wliich the measures are compared, and the

--assurance that we have the entire range of error, at least in one direction, within the

record.' Sir J. F. W. Herschel, Udiii. Eer. vol. xcii.

     ' See the Report for 1881 for a discussion of this subject by Mr. Lawson and

-- --Mr. Roberts.

     - Also in a note at p. 121 of the Report for 1880.

     ' Mr. Roberts has followed Quetelet in the use of the word mean, and its differ-

--ence from an arera^ge is thus explained bj- Sir John Herschel. Speaking of Quetelet's

honmie moyen he says : ' Now, this result, be it observed, is a mean as distinguished
from an average. The distinction is one of much importance, and is ver}^ properly
insisted on by M. Quetelet, who proposes to use the word mean only for the former,
and to speak of the latter (average) as the " arithmetical mean." .... An average
may exist of the most different objects, as of the height of houses in a town, or the
size of books in a library. It may be convenient to convej' a general notion of the
things averaged, but involves no conception of a natural and recognised central
magnitude, all differences from which ought to be regarded as deviations from a
standard. The notion of a mean, on the other hand, does imply such a conceirtion,
standing distinguished from an average by this very feature, viz., the regular viareh

of the groups, increasing to a maximnm and then again diminisMng. An average
gives us no assurance that the future will be like the past. A mean may be reckoned

on with the most implicit confidence. All the philosophical value of statistical
resiilts depends on a due appreciation of this distinction, and acceptance of its con-
sequences.' Edin. Rev. vol. scii. Mr. Galton, however, desires to state that con-

sidering many statistical groups which are regular in their distribution are at the
same time normally asymmetrical, he does not recognise the expressions of 'mean

value' and ' the value most likely to be observed ' as strictly equivalent.

                                                Summary of Information Ohtained.

13. The Committee submit in this, its final Report, a review of all the

information which it has collected under the different heads of inquiry,

giving references to those tables and conclusions which have been pub-

lished in its previous Reports, and adding such others as it has been able

to draw from the several sources at its command.

14. The first object of the Committee has been to ascertain the prin-

cipal characteristics of the adult population :

a. As to the stature, weight, chest-girth, and strength of the whole

country and of each of its four provinces, shown in Table I., pages 256,

257.

h. The relative stature, weight, and strength of men and women.

Table II., page 261.

c. The stature, weight, and complexion (colour of eyes and hair)

of men in different counties as indicating their racial origin, and the in-

fluence of soil, climate, occupation, and other sanitary surroundings.

d. The relative stature of men oY British origin, an^ that of other

nationalities and races as far as they have been ascertained. Tables V.

and VI., pages 268, 269.

15. The second object the Committee has had in' view has been to

ascertain the rate of growth and development of childi'en of both sexes

under different conditions of life (media) ; the period cif the attainment of

maturity ; and the influence of advancing age on the physical condition

of the body. Tables XII. to XXV.

                                                      --a. Adult Males Table I.

     16. Table I. shows the stature, weight, chest-girth, and strength of
adult males of the ages from twenty-three to fifty years, the number of

men at each measurement, and the ratio per thousand of the male popu-

lation.

17. The observations are grouped according to the place of birth in

England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland ; and, with the exception of the
Irish, they were chiefly derived from the division of the country under
which they are entered in the table. The Irish returns are almost

entirely those of men born in Ireland, but living in England, Scotland,

or Wales and the Committee regrets that it has not been able to obtain
                                                           ;

more than one return direct from Ireland. The Scotch and Welsh by birth,

living in England, have been entered under their I'espective nationalities.

The columns are arranged in the order of the superiority of the average
stature and weight.

    18. The general results indicated by this table may be summarised as

--follows : In height the Scotch stand first (68*71 inches 1'746 metres),
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

the Irish second (67'90 inches; 1"726 metres), the English third

(67'36   inches                                 1"712  metres),  and  the  Welsh last  (66'6G inches ;  l'69i
                                             ;

metres), the average of the whole being 67'66 inches (1'720 metres).

In weight the Scotch take the first place (165"3 lbs. ; 75'1 kilos.),

the Welsh the second (158'3 lbs. ; 71-9 kilos.), the English the third
(.156-0 lbs.; 70-5 kilos.), and the Irish the fourth (1541 lbs. ; 70-0 kilos.),
the average weight of the whole being 158"2 lbs. (71'9 kilos.). Thus the

Scotch are the tallest and heaviest, the English take the third place in

--both tables, while the position of the Welsh and Irish is reversed the
KEPORT OF THE ANTHB0PO3IETEIC COMMITTEE.                                                               259

Irish, occupying the second place in stature, come last in weight, and

the Welsh, though lowest in stature, stand second in weight. For each
inch of stature a Scotchman weighs 2'406 lbs., a Welshman 2'375 lbs.,
an Englishman 2-301 lbs., and an Irishman 2'270 lbs.

     19. The columns showing the number of individuals per thousand at

each height, besides showing in a uniform manner the relative stature

and weight of the different nationalities, will be useful to military sur-
geons for determining the minimum stature of recruits for the army.

From the run of the figures it is obvious that if each country has to
·contribute its relative quota of soldiers, the minimum standard for Welsh

recruits should be two inches lower, and for English and Irish recruits

one inch lower, than for Scotch recruits. This difference in the relative

stature is best shown by the black line running across the table, which

--marks the mean height that is to say, the height at which the greatest

number of observations occur in each nationality.
    20. It is probable that too much importance has been attached to

stature in selecting recruits for the army in this country, and that a
high standard does not necessarily produce men best fitted for military

duties. In the Report for 1879 are given two tables of the stature and

weight of the English, Scotch, and Irish recruits for the years 1862-3,

when the minimum standard of height was C6 inches (1'677 metres), and

in 1864-65, when it was reduced to 65 inches  (1'626      metres)                                      and the
                                                                                                    ;

result of this change was to lower the general average stature of English

recruits by only 0'17 inch, of the Scotch by 0'21 inch, and the Irish by

0-25 inch, but in all three nationalities to increase the average weight

the English by 1-3 lbs., the Scotch by 67 lbs., and the Irish by 0-8 lb.

21. Although the minimum standard was the same for all the

nationalities, the influence of race is indicated by the difference in the

average stature of the recruits. The English and Welsh recruits (who

were not distinguished from each other) were shorter in stature than the

Irish by 0'30 inch, and the Scotch by 0'44! of an inch-'

22. The measurements of the chest given in Table I. are almost

entirely those of Englishmen, and must be studied in connection with the

English observations of height and weight ; and the same remark applies

to the figures relative to strength. The chest-girths were taken by the

method adopted in the British army, and the strengths by the spring-

balance introduced by this Conimittee, and described in Appendix A.

    23. An examination of Table I. shows that an adult Englishman oi

'typical proportions has a stature of 5 feet . 7^ inches ; a chest-girth of

36^ inches ; a weight of 10 stones 10 lbs. ; and is able to draw, as in

drawing a bow, a weight of 77^ pounds. These are the mean propor-

--tions. The averages give greater weight for height ; they are : Height,

5 feet 7^ inches; weight, 11 stones 1 lb. ; empty chest-girth, 36 "46 inches;

and strength, 79'6 lbs. For every variation of an inch in stature above

or below the avei-age, 2o01 lbs. weight, ··542 inch chest-girth, and

1-182 lbs. strength must be added or subtracted to keep up the typical

pi'oportions. This rule of proportion is, however, only approximately

correct, as variations in the stature depend la,rgely on the length of the

lower limbs, while the other qualities depend chiefly on the size of the

trunk. In ascending the scale of height, therefore, the above figures are

probably a little too great, while in the opposite direction they are barely

sufiicient, but in either case they are suificieutly near for all practical

' Furtlier tables relating to recruits are given in Appendix B to this Keport.

Apurposes.'    further development of this rule as applicable to both

sexes and at all ages will be found in Table XX.

     24. Plate IV. shows the relative stature of the four British nationali-

ties, traced from the columns in the table showing the number of men

at each height per thousand. The curve of the English very nearly

corresponds with that of the average for the whole kingdom. The Scotch

curve is above the average, and from its irregularity it is evident that

the obsei'vations on which it is based are not quite representative of that

part of the kingdom. The Welsh curve is below the general average,

and in a manner balances the excess of the Scotch, while the Irish

curve is somewhat too acute, owing to the comparatively small number

of observations on which it is based.

              --h. Adult Males and Females Table II.

     25. Table IT. shows the relative stature, weight, and strength of adult
males and females in England, no returns for females having been received
from other parts of the kingdom. The average stature of adult males is
C7"36 inches (1'712 metres), and of females, t)2'Go inches (1'5'J2 metres)^
showing a difference of 4-71 inches ('120 metres), or nearly 4| inches.
The average weight of males is 155'0 lbs. (70"5 kilos.), and that of
females 122-8 lbs. (65-8 kilos.), showing an excess of 32-2 lbs. (147
kilos.), or about 2^ stones on the side of males, the percentnge difference of
weight being just threefold that of height. The ratio between the stature of

men and women in England is as 1 to 0'930, or as 16 to 14'88, the difference

being somewhat greater than in Belgium, where, according to Quetelet,.
the ratio is as 1 to 0'937, or about 16 to 15 (strictly 16 to 14-99). The
observations of the strength of females wete obtained from pupils in
training institutions for schoolmistresses and from shop assistants, and

the average is no doubt much lower than if the labouring classes were
also represented. The difference of strength is 35 lbs., the females being
little more than half as strong as males. In these tables, the age of the

attainment of maturity is fixed at 23 years for males, and 20 years for
females, the reasons for which will be explained in another part of the

Report.

     ' The following measurements show the diflference between the height of the

body of men in the standing and recumbent positions, and the span of arms measured

across the front of the chest. Also the difference between the height of the body in
the standing and the sitting positions, showing the relative length of the trunk and
of the lower limbs. The English figures are calculated from the American measure-
ments of Dr. Hitchcock, taken in 1882.

      27. To save much detailed description, the Committee has thought it
· desirable to illustrate Table III. by a series of shaded maps (Plates V.-IX.),

 which present at once to the eye the relative distribution of the stature,
 weight, and complexion of the adult male population in the several
 counties of Great Britain and in each province of Ireland.

     Map No. 1 shows the distribution of the average stature (without

 shoes) of adult males, in degrees of half an inch each from G6 to 70 inches.

 The darkest shade represents the shortest stature.

     Map No. 2 shows the distribution of the average weight (including

" the clothes) of adult males, in degrees of five pounds from 145 pounds to
 180 pounds. The darkest shade represents the lightest weight.

     Map No. 3 shows the distribution of adult males with fair complexion,

 i.e. blue and grey eyes with fair, light-brown, brown, and light- red hair.
 The darkest shade represents the lowest percentage of fair complexion.

     Map No. 4 shows the distribution of adult males with dark com-

 plexion, i.e. brown and black eyes, with brown, dark brown, dark red,
 and black hair. The darkest shade represents the highest percentage of
 dark complexion, or its greatest prevalence.

     Map No. 5 shows the distribution of adult males with mixed com-

 plexion, i.e. blue and grey eyes with dark brown and black hair. The

· darkest shade represents the highest percentage, or the greatest prevalence

 of this complexion.

      28. As the observations were necessarily made on a limited number
 of individuals, and as doubts may exist as to whether the results can be

 accepted as representing the whole of the male population at the ages
 specified, the counties having similar statures have been grouped together,
 and the male population for each group ascertained from the Census
 returns of 1881.' The average stature worked out from these figures is
 67"58 inches, while that obtained from the actual observations on 8,585
 individuals, given in Table I., is 67'66 inches, the difference between
 the two being only 0"08 of an inch. Table IV. shows the grouping
 of the counties, having the same stature according to the Committee's
 returns, and the total male population of each group at the ages from 25
 to 55 years.

     ' These returns for England and Scotland are not yet published, and the Com-

mittee is indebted to tlie courtesy of the Registrars-General of those portions of

the kingdom for manuscript copies of the returns. The ages of the men on whom

the observations were made are not exactly the same as those obtained from the
 Census office, but they are sufficiently near for any practical purpose. The measure-
ments were made on men from 23 to 51 years of age, while the Census returns are
those of men from 23 to 5.5 years, but the four years above 51 will about compen-
sate for the two years wanting below 25 years both in numbers and stature, in
·consequence of losses by death. Both periods correspond with the best portion of

men's lives, at least as far as stature is concerned.

antiquarian researches, that the ancient Caledonii, the BelgiB and Cimbri,

and the Saxons and Frisians, as well as the Danes and Normans, were all

people of great stature. On the other hand, the prehistoric (neolithic)

race or races in Britain appear to have been of low or moderate

stature. Accordingly the higher statures are found in the Pictish or
                                                                       --

'266           REPORT 1883.

Cimbro-Britisli districts of Galloway ; in the Anglo-Danish ones of
North and East Yorkshire, Westmoreland and Lincolnshire, and in
Cunaberland, whose people are ethnologically intermediate between the
two. Lothian and Berwickshire are mainly Anglian, while the Perth-
shire Highlanders are the most clearly identified as the descendants of
the Caledonii. The high position of Norfolk in the list is due to a large
admixture of Danish blood on the coast. There is a fringe of moderately
high stature all round the coast from Norfolk to Cornwall, while the
inland people, retaining more of the ancient British blood, yield lower
averages. Middlesex and Hertfordshire, which stand very low, were
later and less perfectly colonised by the Anglo-Saxon than the surround-

ing counties, and nearly the same may be said of the counties around the
Severn estuary and the Welsh border. Cornwall stands higher than the

surrounding counties, and this is probably due to its having become the
refuge of the military class of Southern Britain, in the main of Belgic
origin. Flint and Denbigh owe their superiority to the other Welsh

--counties to the immigration of the Cumbrian and Strathclyde Britons.'
    Dr. Beddoe.

      30. According to the Committee's returns, the western provinces of
Ireland possess a high stature, similar to the Scotch Highlands, with

which they may have a common racial origin, while the lower stature of

the eastern provinces is probably traceable to the comparatively recent

Scotch and English immigrations. The Irish returns are, however, too
few to be relied on (although the closeness of the averages for all the
provinces would suggest the absence of any errors of observation), and
any conclusions drawn from them must be received with great reserve
until they are confirmed by more extended inquiries. In some of the
returns the county origin and birthplace was not recorded, which ac-
counts for the difference between the totals for the whole of Ireland and

those living in each province.

     31. The racial elements of the British population are best demon-
strated by separating a few of the counties where there has been the least
admixture of foreign blood, and comparing these together, thus :

  --32. Geographical distribution. The inhabitants of the more elevated

districts possess a greater stature than those of alluvial plains. The

counties forming the river valleys of the Severn and Wye, the Thames^
the Dee and Mersey, the Clyde, the Trent, and the fen district of Cam-
bridge and Huntingdon, show a lower stature than the surrounding

counties inhabited by persons of a similar racial origin.
    33. With respect to latitude and climate, the inhabitants of the northern

and colder districts possess greater stature than those of the southern and
warmer parts of the island ; those of the north-eastern and drier regions

Aare taller than those of the south-western and damper climates. similar

disposition of stature has been found to exist in France and Italy, the

                                        REPOET OF THE ANTHROPOMETRIC COMMITTEE.               267

inhabitants of both these counti-ies being taller in the northern than in the ·
southern provinces. The same rule applies to the whole of the countries

of Europe, in their relation to each other, as will be seen in Table IV., con-
structed to show the position held by the inhabitants of the British Isles

relative to the stature of other European countries. The Committee

regrets that it has not been able to obtain any information on this subject

direct from the European countries (except some referring to conscripts,,

which were not suitable for their purpose), and has beeii obliged to avail
itself of the observations made in the United States of America on

emigrants from European States. In reading this table it must be borne
in mind that the statistics referring to the United Kingdom, collected by

the Committee, and to the native-born population of the United States,

refer to men of all classes ; while those collected by the military autho-

rities of 1863-4 in the United States, referring to Canada and the other

American countries, and to those of all Eurojae, refer to emigrants,

who belong almost entirely to the labouring classes. The close accord

between the average stature of the United Kingdom (67'66 inches) and

that of the native white population of the United States (67-67 inches)

is accounted for in this way ; and, on the other hand, the marked dif-

ferences between the statures of the Scotch (68" 71), Irish (67"90), Eng-
lish (67'36), and Welsh (66" 66 inches), as given by the Committee and

those given by the United States Government (67-07, 6674, 66-58, and

66-42 respectively) is explained. Some American writers on the subject

have overlooked this important distinction, and, studying only the sta-

tistics obtained in their own country, have concluded that the Anglo-

Saxon race is of greater stature in America than in Great Britain. In

the Report of the Committee for 1879 Mr. Roberts has given a paper,

illustrated by a series of diagrams and statistical tables, of English and

  --34. Occupation and sanitary surroundings. The various industries of

this country are not often so defined by the county boundaries as to show

their eflEects on the physical development. It is probable, however, that

the low stature in the West Riding of Yorkshire is due to the large

manufacturing town population included in the returns, and the rela-
tively low stature of Durham to the large mining population. Lanca-

shire and Stafford, which contain similar industries to those of the West

Riding and Durham, do not show any falling oif in stature, and it is

probable that a large number of returns received from Sheffield have un-

fairly lowered the West Riding. The very low position, lower than can

be accounted for by their racial origin, taken by the home counties

--Hertford, Middlesex, and Surrey is no doubt due to their proximity to

London the                              more vigorous  men are  attracted  to  the  town  by  high

wages, and the more feeble overflow into the surrounding districts. The

counties which fringe the sea-coast possess a higher stature than those

a,djoining them but lying further inland. This may be due to race, as

has already been suggested ; but it may also be due to the more healthy

situation or the fishing occupation. The lower stature of the river valleys

would seem to imply that such situations are not favourable to physical

development, especially as some of them were originally settled by the

Scandinavian races.

     35. Considering the large number of different races included in tlie-
Britisli Empire, and the political and commercial relations of its people witln
nearly every other country, the Committee think it will be interesting and
useful to give a table showing the average stature of the different races
and nationalities of the world, as far as it has been able to ascertain them*
from published records. The list is very imperfect, and it is probable that
many of the measurements need revision by more extensive observation-

No nation is so favourably situated for revising and completing the list aa ·
our own and the Committee hope that the table will be instrumental in

                                              ;

promoting further observations of the kind, especially by medical officer's-
in the Navy and Army, and others practising in our numerous colonies andi

kwdependencies. It is interesting to find that, with the exception of a

imperfectly-observed South Sea Islanders, and whose actual numbers, if
the measurements are correct, are very few, the English professional
classes head the long list, and that the Anglo- Saxon race takes the chief

place in it among the civilised communities, although it is possible it

might stand second to the Scandinavian countries if a fair sample of their,
population were obtained.

of Ayrshire with that of Glasgow and Edinburgh, where the average

difference in stature amounts to 4-15 inches, and in weight to 36-4 Ibs.^

Ain favour of the country folk.  similar, though not so great a difference,

exists in Yorkshire, where the fishermen of Flamborough exceed the

artisans of Sheffield in stature by 2-91 inches, and in weight by 24-3 lbs.

On the other hand, the population of London exceeds that of the adjoining

county of Hertfordshire in stature by 1-57 inches, and in weight by

7'9 lbs. Quetelet observed the same condition in Belgium, where the

towns showed a higher stature than the country districts ; and he con-
cluded that the greater ease and better food attainable in towns were

more favourable to physical development than the hard manual labour

and poor fare of the agricultural districts. It is probable that Quetelet

compared different classes together, or that the towns in Belgium hold an

exceptional position, like London to the adjoining districts in England.

38. As an example of the predominance of race over occupation, the

stature and weight of the Scotch lead-miners of Wenlockhead, and the

"Welsh lead-miners of Cardiganshire, are given in the table. The occupa-

tion of lead-mining in both districts is in a great measure hereditary, and

has probably been followed under similar conditions in Scotland and

Wales for many generations, yet the Scotch exceed the Welsh lead-

miners in stature by 2-13 inches, and in weight by 8-7 lbs. The stature
and weight of the Durham coal-miners, and of the town populations of
Glasgow, Sheffield, and Bristol, are given in this table, as they have been

referred to above as influencing the averages of their respective counties,

and placing them in an exceptional position as to the racial origin of

their inhabitants.

39. One of the objects the Committee has had in view lias been 'to

ascertain the physical differences of boys and men whose intellect and

industry are above or below the average ' ; but no returns of this kind
have been received, except some referring to criminals and lunatics, and

those have been introduced here as the most convenient place for their

consideration :

--Table VIII. Showing the Statuke and Weight of Adult -Male Criminals

         and Lunatics, coj
KEPOKT OF THE ANTHROPOMETIIIC COMMITTEE.  273

   40. When compared with the general population, lunatics show a de-

ficiency o£ stature of 1"96 inches, and of weight 10"3 lbs. ; and criminals
of 2"06 inches and 17'8 lbs., indicating a deficiency of physical as well as
mental stamina in both these unfortunate classes of society. In respect
to complexion lunatics show an excess of 5 per cent, of light eyes with
dark hair, and criminals of 10 per cent, of dark eyes with dark hair over

the general population.

            Lunatics, compared with that of the General Population.

    42. As an example of high physical qualities as developed by training,

the measurements of eighty-nine professional and amateur athletes are
given. Their average stature exceeds that of the general population

from which they are drawn by 068 inch, while their average weight falls
short of that standard by 14'5 lbs. The ratio of weight to stature is, in

the athletes, 2-100 lbs., and in the general population 2-323 lbs., for each
inch of stature. Thus, a trained athlete whose stature is 5 feet 7 inches

should weigh 10 stones, while an untrained man of the same height

should weigh 11 stones.
     43. The statures of the Metropohtan Police and the London Fire

Brigade are given as selected men of the working classes. The former
exceed the criminal class, with whom they have to deal, in stature by
4-5 inches, and in weight by 45-3 lbs. The men of the Fire Brigade are

selected for their activity, and general fitness to meet sudden and trying
demands on their physical and mental energies. The data referring to

them may be accepted, therefore, as typical of the best physique which
can be obtained for an English army, and of which our army should con-

sist at its best.

          Complexion as determined hy the Colour of the Eyes and Hair.

     44. The difficulty of determining the prevailing complexion of a race^
or of the mixed population of a country or a district, by the colour of the
hair, as is generally done, and of basing a classification on it, is greater than
at first sight appears. Xot only do the various shades run imperceptibly

into each other, but observers difi'er in their appreciation of the different

shades when viewed under similar conditions, and the prevailing colour
of a district determines the relative value of others. Thus a person
living among a dark-haired race would consider brown hair as fair,
while another person living among a light-haired people would consider
it dark, or at any rate not fair in the same sense as the former would.

Objections of this kind do not apply to the eyes, as the colour of the iris
is due to tlie anatomical disposition of pigment in front of or behind

that structure. In brown and the so-called black eyes a laj-er of brown
pigment covers the front of the iris and hides the deeper structures, and
itself determines the colour ; while in blue and grey eyes this layer of
pigment is wanting, aud the colour is due to the dark pigment (the

choroid) situated liehindthQ iris, the blue colour in various degrees re-

sulting from the greater translucency of a thin, and the grey from a
thick membrane. The marriage, moreover, of fair and dark persons
often produces an intermediate shade in the colour of the hair in the
children, but only occasionally produces an intermediate change in the
colour of the eyes, the rule being that they are blue or brown like one of
the parents. The cross between the blue and brown eye should properly
be called green (the deeper blue showing tln-ough an imperfect layer of
yellow brown pigment), but from popular prejudice to this term, eyes of
this mixed colour are generally recorded as brown grey, light brown or

light hazel.*

     45. For these reasons the classification adopted in this Report is based
on the colour of the eyes, and with the object of more clearly defining the
two prevailing shades of complexion in this country, namely the ' fair ' as
characterised by light eyes and light hair, and the ' dark ' by dark eyes

         · See the Keport for 1880, p. 134, for a further discussion of this subject.

and dark hair, the mixed or neutral eyes are eliminated, and the dark

hair is separated from the former, and the light hair from the latter
class. The combinations of blue eyes and light red hair, and of brown
eyes and dark red hair, are given in separate columns, but the result is

not satisfactory, as many cases of light red have doubtless been returned
as fair hair, and of dark red as dark brown hair.

     46. In the instructions issued by the Committee observers were re-
quested to return the colours of eyes as grey, light blue, blue, dark blue,
light brown, brown, dark brown, green, and black ; and the colour of
the hair as very fair, fair, golden, red, red brown, light brown, brown,
dark brown, black brown, and black, and some chromo-lithographic

sheets as tests ' for the colour of the hair were at first issued ; but
the system was found to be too complicated for ordinary observers to
follow, and they were left to record the colours of both hair and eyes

accordmg to the popular meaning of the above terms. An examination

of the returns shows that in many cases wide limits have been given
to such words as fair, golden, and brown at one end of the scale, and of
dark brown and black at the other, which has necessitated the concen-

In the Report of the Committee for 1880 a table is given of the colour of
eyes and hair according to the above scale, of boys and men of the pro-

fessional classes from ten to fifty years of age, but, apart from its

including too wide a range of ages, it is not so well adapted for showing
the relative i^revalence of complexions as the one now given.

      47. The following grouping of the counties according to the prevalence
of fair complexion, or, what is the same thing, according to the degree of
nigrescence, shows that certain large districts--much larger than the
county boundaries--are occupied by inhabitants of similar racial origin,

or who have been subject to conditions of life which have reduced them
to similar shades of complexion. The division of the percentages into

onlfy  aegrees      is, of course, quite                                                                                                                     arbitrary, and sometimes two counties,
       divided                                                                                                                                               decimal, and belonging therefore to the
                   from each other by a

same group, may be represented by a difierent number. The exact per-
centages are given in Table III.

      48. In this classification the men with dark eyes and light hair are
combined with those having neutral eyes (green) and light or dark hair,
because they are few in number, and because this peculiar complexion is
probably due to crossing of the light and dark stocks, and the persistence
mot one feature of the parent in the eyes and of the other in the hair.

1 He tact that men with dark eyes and light hair are more frequently
tound  the south-western counties of England, where the lic^ht and

dark races meet and overlap each other, supports this view of their mixed

49. In connection with tliis subject Table XI., showing the colour

of eyes and hair in both sexes and at all ages, should be studied, as

it shows the comparative worthlessness of the method often resorted to on

the Continent of determining the racial elements of a country by examin-

ing the complexion of school childj»en of different ages. The first column,

referring to males (light eyes and fair hair), shows the gradual darkening

of the hair of fair-complexioned children from 56 per cent, at the first

five years of life to 33 per cent, at forty-five years ; and the second column
(light eyes with dark hair) increases during the same period at nearly a

corresponding rate, the percentage of dark hair being 9'3 in the first five

=years and 34 at forty-five years of age. Thus, 56 -f 9'3 65-3, and

+33 34 := 67, or only 17 per cent, excess of dai'k hair received from

other sources, or due to probable error of observation. In like manner

the green and light-brown eyes of the middle column of the table decrease

in number, or in other words become darker, and are transferred to the

next column (dark eyes and dark hair) as age advances, from 15 per

cent, at the first five years to 6 per cent, at forty-five years of age. The

fifth column (dark eyes and hair) increases at the expense of the two

adjoining columns from 15-5 per cent: at three and four years to 36 per

cent, at twenty-nine years, after which age the percentage falls off very

rapidly on account of the earlier accession of grey hair in the dark than

the fair complexion of the first column, to which the higher percentages

become transfen-ed. The low percentage of dark complexion at ages

from forty to seventy years does not arise from the elimination of this

complexion by advancing age, or by death, but from the fault of the ob-

servers not having recorded the original colour of the hair before it became

grey, which necessitated the rejection of all such returns in drawing up

the table.

60. The table referring to females shows that darkening of the hair

and eyes takes place to a much less extent amongst them than among-

males, and that there is little disposition for the dark hair to turn grey

with advancing age. For corresponding periods to those applied to

males, the fair-complexioned females in the first column lose 3"8 per cent.

of their number, while the second column receives an accession of dark

hair of 4'7 per cent. The dark-complexioned (dark eyes and hair)

females in the fifth column increase by 8'6 per cent., at the sole expense

of the sixth column, by the darkening of the hair. Unlike the males, the

column showing the neutral eyes somewhat increases instead of de-

creases                                   and  this  increase  appears  to  have  come from  the  column con-
                                       ;

taining the fair eyes and red hair, or it may be attributed to the difference

--in the ' colour equation ' of some of the observers women being much

more critical, and therefore less consistent, than men in the definition of

colours.

  --Note. Dr. Beddoe proposes the use of indices of nigrescence for the classi-

fication of the colour of hair and eyes. ' That for the hair is got bj' subtracting the
fair and the red from the dark hair plus twice the black, leaving out the neutral

browns, thus :

                       2 Black (N) + Dk. Br. - Fair - Ked = Index.

The black hair is doubled, because its occurrence shows a much greater tendency tO'

melanosity. The index for the eyes is got by subtracting the light from the dark
and neglecting the neutral shades, thus :

                                     Dark -- Light = Index.'

                                         Children and Adults of both Sexes.

A51. large portion of the statistics collected by the Committee refer

to children, and these, together with those referring to the adults already

considered in the early part of this Report, have been arranged in Tables

XV. to XXV. to show the influence of age, sex, nurture, occupation,

and sanitary surroundings on the physical development of the British

population. The children are chiefly those of English parents, as few

returns have been received from other parts of the kingdom. All classes

of the community are represented, from the upper and professional classes

whose children attend the Public Schools, like Eton, Marlborough, and

Radley, to the poorest town population, whose children are found in the

public elementary (or Board) schools, charitable institutions, and

industrial schools. The adults also include all classes, from the Univer-
sities of Oxford and Cambridge, to town labourers and factory operatives.

52. In deciding upon the arrangement for practical purposes of returns

so vai'ied in their origin, and yet consisting in so large a proportion of

information derived from special sources, the first consideration has been

to establish a classification of the returns according to the media, or in-

fluences which have been instrumental in diff'erentiating one class from

another. The Committee has adopted the subjoined scheme, prepared by

Mr. Roberts, and first brought before the Association in a paper read in

the Anthropological Section in 1878. It is based on the principle of

collecting into a standard class as large a number of cases as possible

which imply the most favourable conditions of existence in respect to

--fresh air, exercise, and wholesome and suSicient food in one word, nurture

--and specialising into classes which may be compared with this standard

those which depart more or less from the most favourable condition. By

this means, in respect to social condition, the influence of mental and

manual work ; in respect to nurture, the influence of food, clothing, &c.,.

on development ; in respect to occupation, the influence of physical con-

ditions                                  and in respect to climate and sanitary conditions, the influence of
                                      ;

town and country life may be determined.

53. The classification has been constructed on the physiological and

hygienic laws which are familiar to the students of sanitary science, and
on a careful comparison of the measurements of difierent classes of the

people, and especially of school children of the age of from eleven to

twelve years. This age has been selected as particularly suited to the

study of the media, or conditions of life, which influence the development

of the human body, as it is subject to all the wide and more powerful

agencies which surround and divide class from class, but is yet free from

the disturbing elements of puberty and the numerous minor modifying

influences, such as occupation, personal habits, &c., which in a measure
shape the physique of older boys and adults. The data on which the

classification has been based are given below. The most obvious facts

which the figures disclose are the check which growth receives as we

descend lower and lower in the social scale, and that a difference of five
inches exists between the average statures of the best and the worst
nurtured classes of children of corresponding ages, and of 3^ inches in.

                                                      Infants at Birth. Table XV.

64. The statistics relating to infants at birth have been tabulated

separately, because the conditions of measurement differ from those of

other children, the stature having been taken in the recumbent position,

and the veeight without clothing. The parents of the infants were

English and  Scotch                                   and  although the  charitable institutions from which
                                                   ;

the observations were obtained are situated in London and Edinburgh,

persons bred in the country are frequently admitted as inmates, and it

is probable, therefoi'e, that the statistics fairly represent the labouring

classes. Observations on infants of other classes of society could not be

obtained. The statistics refer only to infants presumably born at the fall

period of gestation, and contain the due proportion of twin births. The

table is constructed to show the relative stature and weight of each infant,

and the differences between the sexes.

55. The table is one of great interest to the student examining the

physical development and the physical improvement of a race, as it

presents the materials with which he has to deal in its earliest and simplest

form. According to this table the average length of male infants is

19'52 inches, and of females 19 32 inches, showing a difference of only

one-fifth of an inch. The average naked weight of male infants is 7'12 lbs.,

and of females 6'94 lbs., a difference of about 3 ounces in favour of males.

The range of height between the tallest and shortest male infants is 10
inches, while that of boys of 15 years, when the disturbing influences of

puberty are present, is 27 inches. This wide range in adolescence becomes

contracted in adults to 20 inches. The range of height of female infants

is two inches less than that of male infants, which may be due to accidental

causes, but which suggests a less disposition to variation in the size in

females than in males,' and which may be the cause of the greater freedom

of female infants from accidents at the time of birth. It has been ascertained

that still births occur in this country in the proportion of 140 males to 100

females, and this higher death-rate of male infants has been attributed to

Wetheir greater size.                                 have no statistics of the size or weight of still-bom.

infants, although they could be more easily obtained than those of living

infants, but the table before us would seem to confirm this view, as the

largest surviving infants are those of males. It would appear, therefore,

that the physical (and most probably the mental) proportions of a race,
and their uniformity within certain limits, are largely dependent on the

size of the female pelvis, which acts as a gauge, as it were, of the race, and

eliminates the largest infants, especially those with large heads (and pre-

sumably more brains), by preventing their survival at birth.^

     ' The greater disposition to vary in range of stature of males than females has

been already referred to in the Report of the Committee for 1880, p. 141, in connection
with Sir Rawson Rawson's analysis of the successive annual measurements of 12

boys and 13 girls made by Professor Bowditch, of Harvard, United States. ' A marked

feature in the charts when compared together is the greater regularity and parallel-

ism of the growth of the girls, especially at the earlier periods of life.'

     ^ To ascertain if there is any difference between the circumference of the skull as
compared with that of the pelvis in adults of very different races of man, Mr.
Roberts has measured the skulls and pelves of some European and Andamanese

     56. Tables XVI. to XXII. show the growth of children of four of the

five classes into which the returns have been divided. Class I. comprises

the upper and professional classes and their children, and it may be

accepted as representing the best physique of this country, and used as a
standard with which to compare all other classes. According to the
census of 1871 this class constitutes 4'46 per cent, of the population.
Class II. consists of the commercial classes, such as clerks and shop-
keepers and their children, whose occupations are carried on in towns,
and for the most part indoors, and therefore under less favourable con-
ditions to healthy development than the constituents of Class I. Class II.
comprises 10'36 per cent, of the population. Class III. represents the
labouring classes, such as agricultural labourers, fishermen, miners, and

others who follow outdoor healthy occupations, but whose nurture is

inferior to the two former classes. This class comprises 47'46 per cent.
or nearly half the population of the country. Class IV. represents the
mass of our town population engaged as artisans. Their trades, being
carried on indoors, and requiring less physical exercise than Class III.,,
place them under less favourable conditions as to sanitary surroundings.
This class forms 26'82 per cent., or about a fourth of the population.
Class v., comprising persons living in towns and following sedentary
occupations under the most unfavourable conditions as to nurture and
sanitary surroundings, has been omitted from the tables, as sufiicient data
have not been received to fairly represent it. This class constitutes 10'90
per cent, of the population.

     57. The average stature and weight of each of the four classes have
been worked out from the number of observations for each class, but as

the several classes constitute different proportions of the general popula-
tion the average representing the ' general population ' has not been

worked out from the total number of observations, but is the average of

skeletons in the Museum of the Koyal College of Surgeons, with the follo^ving

results :
 288 REPORT-- 1883.

 tlie other foar averages, and it is therefore the average of the four classes
 rather than of all the individuals measured and weighed. The observa-
 tions referring to adults are fairly representative of the general popu-
 llation as they were received from all parts of the country ; but those
 referring to children were received from schools devoted to the educa-
 tion of special classes of society, and in numbers which did not correspond
  with their respective pei'centage proportion of the general population.

 By adopting the average of the averages of the four classes into which

 the school children have been distributed according to the occupations
 of their parents, the inequality of the percentage proportion has been
 eliminated. Tables and a diagram showing the mean stature, weight,
 chest-girth, and strength of males, as deduced from all the observations
 collected by the Committee, are given in the Report of 1881.

       58. Tables (XIII., XIV.) have already been given (s. 53) which show
 the falling off in the average stature of children of the age 11-12 years,
 and of adults of the age 25-30 years, as the conditions under which they
 live are less and less favourable to healthy physical development. The
 children vary to the extent of five inches, and the adults to 3^ inches, and
 corresponding variations occur in the weights and other physical qualities.

       59. Plate X. shows the growth in stature, weight, and strength of
 individuals of both sexes, and the girth of chest, head, arm, and leg of
 males as far as they have been recorded in the returns received by the
 committee. The tracings are made from the averages in the column re-
 presenting the general population. Similar tracings of the standard class
 (males) having been given in the Report for 1880.

     60. An examination of the curves and tables shows the following facts :

      (1) Growth is most rapid during the first five years of life ; the
 observations, however, at those ages are not sufiicient in number or

 variety to give a trustworthy average.

      (2) From birth to the age of five years the rate of growth is the
same in both sexes, girls being a little shorter in stature and lighter in

 weight than boys.

     (3) From 5 to 10 years boys grow a little more rapidly than girls,

the difference being apparently due to a check in the growth of girls at

'these ages.

     (4) From 10 to 15 years girls grow more rapidly than boys, and at

the ages 11^ to 14^ are actually taller, and from 12|- to 15^ years actually
heavier than boys. This difference appears to be due to a check in the
growth of boys as well as an acceleration in the growth of girls incident
on the accession of puberty.

     (5) From 15 to 20 years boys again take the lead, and grow at first

rapidly, and gradually slower, and complete their growth at about 23
years. After 15, girls grow very slowly, and attain their full stature
about the 20th year.

      (6) The tracings and tables show a slow but steady increase in
stature up to the 50th year, and a more rapid increase in weight up to

the 60th year in males, but the statistics of females are too few after the
age of 23 to determine the stature and weight of that sex at the more
advanced periods of life.

     (7) The curve of the chest-girth in males shows an Increase at a
rate similar to that of the weight up to the age of 50 years, but it
appears to have no definite relation to the curve of stature.

     (8) The strength of males increases rapidly from 12 to 19 years, and

at a rate similar to that of the weight ; more slowly and regularly np to
30 years, after which it declines at an increasing rate to the age of 60
years. The strength of females increases at a more uniform rate from
9 to 19 years, more slowly to 30, after which it falls off in a manner
similar to that of males. The curves of strength for the two sexes are
not parallel : at 11 years females are weaker than males by 22 lbs., at 20
years of age by 36 lbs.

                       The Period of Maturity in Man.

61. The Tables do not show distinctly at what period man attains his

full stature, and much difference of opinion exists on this subject. Some

French writers (Barnard, Allaire, &c.) maintain that growth in height

goes on until the 32nd or 35th year, and Dr. Baxter arrives at the same

conclusion  from  the  statistics  of the  United  States  Army                                while  most
                                                                                            ;

English writers (Danson, Aitken, Roberts, &c.) I'egard the 25th as the

year of mature growth, and Dr. Beddoe places it as early as the 23rd

year, admitting, however, that a slight increase may take place after this

age. The difference of opinion on this subject arises, no doubt, from the

faulty method of relying on the measurements of many different indivi-

duals, instead of measuring the same individuals from year to year until
growth ceases. The elimination of the weak and ill-developed by death,
the difficulty of following the same class, and all the members of the class,
through successive years, and the selection of special classes (i.e. recruits
whose ages are never certain), invalidate all conclusions as to the period

of maturity drawn from statistics of measurements of many different

persons ; but, allowing for these sources of error, and judging by the run
of the curves formed by the means and averages, it is probable that
little actual growth takes place after the age of 21, and that it entirely
ceases by the 25th year. It is evident, moreover, from Table XVI., that
the full stature is attained earHer in the well-fed and most favoured class

(Class I.) than in the ill-fed and least favoured classes of the community

(Class IV.).

     62. It is difficult to understand, moreover, how any increase of stature

can take place after the bones of the skeleton have become consolidated,.
and the epiphyses firmly united to the body of their respective bones
and the last of these unions in the long bones, on which the stature

depends, occurs about the 23rd year. In adopting the 23rd year for men
and the 20th for women as the ages of the attainment of maturity the

committee was influenced by these considerations, and a desire to under-
state rather than overstate its case, and to embrace as large a number
of observations as possible in its tables. In inquiries of this kind there
is generally a slight amount of unconscious selection, very small persons
being passed over, or having objections to being measured ; and any
deficiency of this kind will be balanced by the loss of growth which

may occur after the age of 23 years. Females attain to maturity earlier

than males, and the age of full growth has been fixed three years earlier
for them.

                       Infltience of Advancing Age.

     63. The maintenance of the stature throughout life as shown by Tablo
XVI. is a new and unexpected fact, but it is probably due to the survival

of the taller and better developed members of the population, and the

elimination by disease or death of the smaller and feebler ones. Quetelet

has stated that man attains his maximum Pieight at the age of 30 years,

and maintains it np to 50 years, after which it begins to recede, and at

90 it has lost three inches. This may be, and probably is, true of indivi-

duals if measured from year to year, but it does not appear to be true of
the population in the aggregate. The loss of stature resulting from the
degeneration and loss of tissue, and the stooping position assumed by
old people, is moi-e than counterbalanced by the survival of a greater

number of individuals who are above the average in height. The

uniform increase in the weight and chest-girth throughout adult life also

confirms this view.

near Manchester, are the most complete in all their details which the Com-

mittee has received from any source, and they may be accepted as models

of what such returns ought to be.

300 EEPOKT-- 1883.

                                Conclusion.

67. Attention has been called to some of the principal points of

interest in the data collected by the Committee, but in many respects the

tables have been left to speak  for  themselves                                                                                                                                                                    and  it  is  not  improbable
                                                                                                ;

that a study of them will lead some persons to conclusions differing

more or less from those given in this Report.

68. The original returns, which the Committee recommend may be

placed in the charge of the Anthropological Institute for preservation

and future examination, comprise many statistics Avhich could not be

introduced into this Report on account of the time and labour required

for their analj'sis and tabulation.

69. The Committee believes that it has laid a substantial foundation

for a further and more exhaustive study of the physical condition of a

people by anthropometric methods, and that its action will prove it has

(been useful as an example to other scientific societies and to individuals

in stimulating them, as well as directing them, in the methods of making

statistical inquiries relative to social questions. The medical officers,
(managers, or superintendents of many colleges, schools, and charitable in-

stitutions have been induced to keep registers of the physical proportions of

those under their chai'ge, which will in a few years become valuable records,

not only of the physical condition of the inmates of their institutions,

but of the sanitary conditions under which they have lived ; they will

also be available for the further study of the subjects specially treated of

in this Report. The Collective Investigation Committee of the British

Medical Association propose to carry on the work of this Committee in a

direction which it is most needed, namely, by issuing an album in which

persons may methodically record at frequent intervals their height, weight,

and other physical qualities, together with points in their personal and

medical history. The Committee hopes that this habit will be largely

adopted and encouraged by the members of the British Association.

70. The Committee has to express its thanks to the numerous contri-

butors to their store of facts, whose names and contributions have been

published from time to time in their interim reports, and to numerous

friends who, although not contributors themselves, have induced others

^to give their assistance.

     * The inquiries relative to Tjrcatliing capadiij were abandoned in 1879 on account
'of the unsatisfactory nature of the returns received previous to that year. The
apparatus were faulty.

      The statistics relating to cycsiffld^-exe. dealt with in tlie Report for 1881, and the

returns since received are not sutticient to require a further discussion of the subject.

      The subject of colon r-Wt ndncss was taken up by <a Special Committee of the
 Ophthalmological Societj' after it had been inaugurated by this Committee, and it was
given up on that account. The very interesting report of the Special Committee is
published in the first volume of the Trans, of the OjjhtJial. Soc. 1881.

  --Girth of Chest. This is the method adopted in the British Army.

Make the person stand quite upright, with his shoulders back, and his

arms hanging loosely by his side. The measurement must be taken next

to the skin, without compressing it. The lower edge of the tape should

touch the nipples, and the measurement should be read off in front.

Care should be taken that the tape passes horizontally round the chest,

because if the measurement is made obliquely, below the blade-bone, it

will be erroneous. The person should be required to count ten slowly

during the operation, to prevent him from keeping his lungs over-inflated.

(If this measurement is made on females, it should be taken helow the

breasts.)

  --Strength of Arm. It is proposed to measure the force that can be

Aexerted by the arm when pulling (as an archer with a bow).  spring

balance should be used for this purpose. The right or left arm, which-

ever is the strongest, should be used to draw, and the other to resist.
The resisting arm must be free, and extended straight from the side, as

nearly as possible in the line of the shoulders, and the hand of the other
arm brought back towards the ear. (A spring balance, or ' arm-testing

machine ' for testing the drawing power, can be obtained of Herbert &

.Sons, 6 West Smithfield, London, E.G., price 18s. Qd.)

     The above figure represents the position in which the strength of arm should be

tested.

     Table XXVI., showing the Stature, Chest-girth, and Weight of
Recruits, is introduced here foi* future reference and comparison. The
figures show that recruits of the age of 18 years may be expected to

  purpose of Defining the Facial Characteristics of the Races and
   Principal Crosses in the British Isles, and obtaining Illustrative

   Photographs.

Owing to the comparative scarcity of skulls and other remains of the
earlier inhabitants of the British Islands, and the imperfect condition of
many of them owing to lapse of time, more difficulty has been expe-
rienced in completing the identification of the Long-barrow type than
occurred in the case of the Round-barrow and Saxon types (B and C),

the features of wliicli were defined in the Report of 1882. There appears,

however, to be little doubt that the short dark type, which, as the Com-

mittee mentioned last year, certainly exists in the population at the

present time, and which offers a marked contrast to the other types,

accords in stature, lightness of frame, narrowness of skull, and fine

osseous features generally, with the skeleton remains found in the majority

of the early barrows. The Committee, therefore, have no difficulty in

Aconsidering it as the main Type ; and its characteristic features have,

consequently, been inserted in the annexed table, for comparison with

Types B and C. The question whether there was a second pre-Celtic

racein this country is  hardly ripe for discussion                                                                                                                 but  it  is receiving the

stature. They request also to be informed of the existence of any skulls
in local museums or private collections, that would assist in the identifi-
cation of the above types.

     Negatives have been taken of very pure examples of the Cymric
race in North Wales, and several photographs have been purchased. The
expenditure has amounted to 4Z. The Committee ask to be reappointed,
and that the grant voted last year be renewed.

Repo7't of the Gomniittee, consistinrj of ]Mr. James Glaisher
    (Secretary), the Rev, Canon Tristram, ci/nd the Rev. F. Lawrexce,
   for promoting the Survey of Eastern Palestine.

     1. The Committee of the Palestine Exploration Fund have been

endeavouring during the last year to obtain from the Saltan the firman
granting permission for the prosecution of the Survey of Eastern

 Palestine.

      2. Their efforts, aided by the personal influence of Lord Dnfferin,
bave hitherto proved ineffectual. They have therefore decided on taking
up another branch of their original prospectus, and will proceed at once
with the Geological Survey of Palestine.

    A3. great deal of geological work has been done in the country by

individual travellers, but up to the present time there has been no expedi-
tion specially organised for the purpose of eS'ecting a complete geological

 survey.

      4. The valley of the Joi'dan and the basin of the Dead Sea have been
 examined by Mr. Lartet, whose work on the subject appeared in the
 year 18G4 ; and by Dr. Fraas, whose report was published in 1867.
 Papers on the geology of Palestine by English travellers have also
 appeared in the quarterly journal of the Geological Society, and else-
 where, by Messrs. Duncan, Carter, Holland, Bauerman, Huddleston,
 and Milne. The Rev. Canon Tristram and Captain Conder have also
 furnished a large quantity of notes and information on the subject.

      5. The Committee of the Exploration Society have been fortunate

 in securing the services of Professor Hull, LL.D., F.R.S., F.G.S.,
 Director of the Geological Survey of Ireland, for this important work.

 He proposes to start about the middle of October, accompanied by his

 son. Dr. E. G. Hull, as medical adviser, and to proceed to examine the

 country from the south, namely, the Wady Ai-abah, which runs north-

 ward from Akabah to the southern shores of the Dead Sea. Here a base

 is found in the granites of the Sinai Peninsula. It will also be desirable
 to penetrate into Moab, along the border of which country the Nubian
 Sandstone comes to the surface ; and most important data, bearing on the

 geological problems, may here be expected. After examining the Wady

 Arabah and the border of Moab the party will proceed, by the route which
 will appear to Professor Hull most convenient, to make the geological

 reconnaissance of Western Palestine.

6. The e:^pedition \\ ill be streBgtliened by the presence and experience

of Captain Kitchener, R.E., formerly one of the officers of the survey of

Western Palestine. Perhaps Lieut. Mantell, R.E., will also be able to

join the party. During the geological operations, the engineers will be

instructed to clear up certain points of interest which lie about that part

of the countr}'. Thus, they will examine the eastern end of the Tih Desert,

and the passes leading up to the plateau, so as to determine the best

route for a lai'ge body of people travelling northwards from Sinai : they

will explore the topographical features of the Arabah east and west,

and the southern edge of the Negeb so as to ascertain the passes from

the Tih plateau to the first terrace : they will examine the sites of

Ezion-geber,  Elath, Kadesh, and       the  way of the                    spies                              look for the road

on the question whether the Israelites did not go over to Arabia Proper

instead of remaining, as is generally supposed, in the Tih Desert. It is

expected that the expedition will accomplish its objects in about four

months. The cost of the whole, including publication of results, is

estimated under 2,000/.

   Dr. J. H. Gladstone {Secretary), appointed to ivatch and re-

  jjort on the worJdngs of the propjosed revised New Code, and of

   other legislation affecting the teaching of Science in Elementary

    Schools.

At the close of their report last year, your Committee stated that, if

reappointed, they proposed to obtain information upon certain points

connected with the working of the New Code, and to draw the attention
of the Council to any matter that may be necessary in connection with

the working of the Code, or in respect of any future alterations.
     Nothing has occurred dui'ing the past twelvemonth which seemed to

require the action of the Council ; and as the reports of Her Majesty's
Inspectors on the schools that have already been examined under the

New Code ai'e only beginning to be issued, it seems premature to come

to any definite conclusion as to its working.

    Two official documents, however, appeared last summer bearing upon,

--the question of Science teaching in Elementary Schools : ' The New

Regulations for Her Majesty's Inspectors,' dated August 9, and the
Circular on 'Higher Board Schools in Wales,' dated August 10, 1882.

     The first is a very important document, as it indicates the intentions
of the Education Department in regard to carrying out the provisions of
310 REPORT-- 1883.

the New Code ; and some of these instructions have a bearing npon the

matters referred to this Committee. In paragraph 5 it is laid down that
where scholars of Standard I. are taught in the Infant department ' the

course of lessons should include simple recitation and lessons in geography
or elementary science to correspond to the class subjects intended to be
taken up in the boys' or girls' school.' Paragraph 20 runs thus : ' In
teaching geography, good maps, both of the county and of the parish or
immediate neighbourhood in which the school is situated, should be
afl&xed to the walls, and the exact distances of a few near and familiar
places should be known. It is useful to mai'k on the floor of the school-
room the meridian line, in order that the points of the compass should

be known in relation to the school itself, as well as on a map.' Para-

graph 28 is as follows : ' In cases in which it is proposed to teach specific

subjects, it will be desirable for you to ascertain that the teacher has
given proof of his fitness to teach them by having acquitted himself
creditably at a training college, or at some other public examination.

Ton will often find that these subjects are most thoroughly taught when

a special teacher is engaged by a group of schools to give instruction in
such subjects once or twice a week, his teaching being supplemented in

the intervals by the teachers of the school. Tou will judge of all schemes
of elementary science which may be submitted to you for approval by

their applicability to the school stay of the bulk of scholars, remembering
that the whole course of study is primarily designed for those children

who go to labour after they have reached the full-time standard.' The

allusion to the engagement of a special teacher for a group of schools
evidently points to the practice at Liverpool and Birmingham. The

merit grant being an important part of the New Code, their Lordships

describe, in paragraph 32, what they consider necessary in order that a
school should be assessed as ' excellent.' Inter alia, they lay it down

that ' if higher subjects are attempted, the lessons are not confined to

memory work and to the learning of technical terms, but are designed

to give a clear knowledge of facts, and to train the learner in the practice
of thinking and observing ; ' and also, ' where circumstances permit it

has .... an orderly collection of simple objects and apparatus adapted

to illustrate the school lessons, and formed in part by the co-operation of

the scholars themselves.'

     The second document, while speaking of the accommodation required
in these ' Higher Board Schools in Wales,' states that ' as the provision
of a rather larger number of class-rooms than are necessary for an ordi-
nary elementary school, and the establishment of one or more laboratories

for practical instruction in chemistry, or branches of physical science

which have a bearing on the industries of the district, may require the
premises of the new school to be of a somewhat more expensive character

than usual, their Lordships will feel themselves justified in relaxing the

rule which limits the amount of the loan, which they are willing to
recommend, to lOZ. per scholar accommodated.'

     All these regulations are quite in accordance with the opinions and
desires of your Committee.

      Several Divisional Conferences were held last Easter with the leading
Inspectors, and the Lords of the Committee of Council on Education have
just communicated the conclusions at which they have arrived on some of
the more important questions discussed at those meetings. They are

contained in a ' Circular of Instructions to Her Majesty's Inspectors as to
----

ON THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 311

Uniformity in Administration of the New Code,' bearing date August 6,

1883. The references to the teaching of natural knowledge are as

follows :

  --' Infant schools or classes. In order to satisfy fully the requirements

of Art. 106 h 2, the mistress early in the school year should draw up, and

enter in the Log Book, a course of thirty or forty collective lessons, e.g.,

on animals                                                   on such objects as coal,  glass, and salt ;  on common employ-
                                                          ;

ments, as paper-making, cotton mill, house-building, one of the trades of

the district being chosen in preference ; on form and colour, food, plants,

and clothing ; on simple facts in nature, as rain, frost, the seasons ; on

familiar scenes in common life, as the post-office, a shop, a railway, wash-

ing, or harvest. Each of these should in the course of the year be given

two or three times, and on the day of inspection the Inspector may select

one or two lessons to be given by the teacher in charge of the class ; then,

at the point of the lesson where questioning begins, he may himself inter-
vene, and ascertain how far the lesson has had intelligent effect.

' It is desirable to recommend teachers (especially assistants and

pupil-teachers) to preserve in a book the notes of such lessons for future

--expansion and reference.
     ' Glass subjects. 'The following variations are allowable in the second

class subject.

' (i.) Elementary science in lower division (Standards I.-III. or I.-IV.)

and geography in upper (Standards IV.-VII. or V.-VII.).

' (ii.) Geography or elementary science in Standards I.-IV. and his-

tory in V.-VII.

' The course of object and elementary science lessons in the lower

standards should, when possible, be preparatory to the specific subject

--if any intended to be taken up in the Fifth Standard.
   --' Specific subjects. Any Inspector who desires aid in the examination

of a specific subject with which he is not acquainted should apply to the

senior Inspector of his Division.'

    The only matter arising out of the working of the New Code which

your Committee feel justified in bringing forward at present, is the pro-

vision which is being made by the larger Boards for the extended teach-

ing of natural knowledge. Special reports have been drawn up as to

these arrangements in London, Manchester, Birmingham, Sheffield, and

Liverpool, and are given in the Appendix.
     Your Committee would draw attention to two or three points. 1.

The largely extended meaning given to object lessons, and the endeavour

to supplant the unintelligent and dry teaching which has often of late

years passed under that name. 2. The appearance of systematic schemes
of elementary science as a class subject, o. The methods by which the

scientific specific subjects are taught at Liverpool and Birmingham. 4.
The increased attention paid to science in the pupil-teachers' centres,

which are now being established in the large towns. This point is con-

sidered* as one of special importance, inasmuch as the pupil- teachers are

now generally expected to give object lessons in the Infant schools, and per-

haps elementary science lessons in the boys' and girls' departments ; while

at the same time there is no provision made in Schedule V. for securing

their getting any instruction whatever in the rudiments of natural know-

ledge. It is true that marks are given to any candidate for admission to
the training colleges who passes successfully in one of eight scientific

^subjects recognised by the Science and Ait Department ; but this fails to

--meet the case in two respects ; first that it does not ensure that every

pupil-teacher shall take up science at all ; in fact, according to the last

report of the Committee of Council on Education, out of 2,061 male can-

--didates only 597, and out of 3,541 female candidates only 166, received
credit  for  scientific  knowledge                                                    second  even as to these it does not

follow that they have such a general knowledge of nature as shall be of

much practical use, seeing thej'^ took up certain specialised sciences. The

only subject of wide range is Physiography ; and this was taken by only

126 males and 24 females.

                                London.

Since the passing of the New Code of 1882 the London Board have

revised their arrangements for the teaching of natural science in their

Aschools.    new circular has been sent out containing instructions to

teachers relative to object lessons and elementary science, laying down a

broad scheme of instruction both in the Infant department and in

Standards I. to VII., from which the teachers may choose any course

they may feel themselves most qualified to take.

It is required that each teacher shall adopt a scheme of ' Elementary

Science ' in the form prescribed by the Code of ' a progressive course of

simple lessons adapted to cultivate habits of exact observation, statement,

and reasoning ; ' but it is not obligatory upon the teacher to take this as

the second-class subject under the Code for examination by Her Majesty's

AInspector.  model scheme, fuller than that in Schedule II. of the Code,,

is suggested ; but teachers are informed that they have fall liberty to

vary it according to their tastes and acquirements.

The scheme is as follows :

ON THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 31 3'

The London Board has not taken into consideration any definite plan

as to the scientific specific subjects of Schedule IV.

The Board, however, now gives instruction to its pupil-teachers at

certain centres, and has made provision for the imparting of a knowledge

of nature at each of these. The course of instruction is divided into four

stages. The first stage begins with Huxley's ' Introductory Primer ' as

a general guide, and treats of general principles of natural knowledge, the

general properties of liquids and gases, and the leading chai'acteristics of

plants and animals. The second stage deals with the properties of solid

bodies, the chemical notions of elements 'and compounds, the mechanical

powers, and the characteristics of the principal divisions of the animal

and vegetable kingdoms. The third stage includes the elementary stage

of Physiography, according to the syllabus of the Science and Art De-

partment, as far as the subjects have not been included in the previous

instruction, or under  the  head  of  geography                                                   such  as the  crust of  the
                                                                                               ;

earth, the sea, the atmosphere, the physical forces, and a general idea

of the animal body. The fourth stage includes the advanced stage of

Physiography, as defined by the Science and Art Department, and the

--application of the various sciences already studied mechanics, electricity,
--physiology to the arts of life. As this course extends over a large range

of subjects, it is understood that none of them should be treated very

fully, but that the information given should be accurate as far as it goes,

and the theoretical conceptions clear. The lessons should of course be

illustrated either by the natural objects themselves, or, where that is not

possible, by diagrams. This course has scarcely got into full operation.

this season ; but an examination of the pupil-teachers was held last July
by the Board's inspectors.

                            Manchester.

Under the Manchester School Board science is taught both in the

Higher Grade Board Schools, and in the ordinary Day schools.

   --I. In Higher Grade Schools. In four schools ^viz., Peter Street,
--Ducie Avenue, St. Matthew's Ardwick,and Upper Jackson Street- science

lessons form part of the ordinary day school work ; in two others some of

the more advanced boys and girls come for one hour in the evening for
--similar instruction.
The subjects taught are                  Mathematics Physiology;
                                                                                                              ;

Inorganic Chemistry, Theoretical and Practical ; Organic Chemistry

Sound, Light, and Heat ; Magnetism and Electricity ; Physiography ; and
Theoretical Mechanics. Some of these subjects are taught in one school,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                .

and some in another. Practical Chemistry has hitherto been taught only

at Peter Street, but now the Board have erected chemical laboratories

at Ducie Avenue and St. Matthew's, Ardwick, and that subject will be-

taught practically at those two schools also this next winter. The teach-

ing of these subjects at the aforenamed schools is under the Science and

Art Department. Last May there were 727 passes.

II. In ordinary Day schools. In some schools Botany, Mechanics, or

Physiology are taken as specific subjects ; and simple lessons on these

sciences are given in the same schools as a kind of introduction to the
work of the upper classes. Algebra and Euclid are taken as specific

subjects in several schools. Object lessons are given not only in the Infant

schools, but also in Upper schools in accordance with the work of the

standard in the Code.

      Extract from a letter of Mr. E. ^I. Hance, Clerk of the Liverpool
School Board :

     ' For Standards V.-VII. we carry on the instruction in " Mechanics,"
a subject which, in the manner it is treated here, is almost equivalent to
" Elementary Physics," previously given in Standards IV.-VI.' For
Standard IV. we are having a preliminary course in the " fii'st stage" of
the subject. In the lower standards we are about to commence, in con-

nection with the class-subject Geography, a systematic course of instruc-
tion in the simpler truths of Physical Geography. Mr. Hewitt, the
Board's Science Instructor, is on the point of giving a course of illus-
trative lectures to the Board's teachers (Head and Assistant) as to the

best mode of demonstrating those truths by experiment ; and it is in-

 tended to supply each teacher with a simple collection of apparatus.
For the Infants' Schools, Mr. Hewitt is prejiaring, and expects to have
ready at least the first part by the end of next month, a series of object

lessons upon things or phenomena of which the children have experience
in their daily life, and near their own homes. The series is designed to
prepare the way for, and to lead up to, the instruction given in the lower

 standards.'

      Systematic instruction in Elementary Science has been introduced
into all the schools connected with the Birmingham School Boavd,.,and
 the results have proved as remarkable as they are satisfactory.

      The staS" consists of a Science Demonsti-ator, with two assistant

 demonstrators.

    A Laboratory has been built at the Ickuield Street Schools, and well

 furnished with scientific appliances.

     The Science Demonstrator and his assistants are employed in visiting
each school in rotation, and giving lessons, which are thoroughly well
illustrated by apparatus and experiments.

     ' An acconnt of this system of instruction is to be found in the Eeport of the

 meeting at Sheffield in 1879, p. 477.
'

ON THE TEACHINa OF SCIENCE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 315

The experiments are carefully prepared in the Laboratory, and a

hand-cart specially fitted up for the purpose conveys the apparatus neces-

sary for their performance from school to school.

The lessons are given in both the girls' and boys' departments to the

children in Standard V. and upwards, and one of the school teachers is

always present. Between the visits of the demonstrators (which are at

present fortnightly) at least one lesson on the same subject is given by

the teacher of the class. In this the matter of the demonstrator's lesson

is recapitulated and expanded, and such new points are taken up as may
be necessary for the completion of the instruction in the subject. An

examination on paper is also held fortnightly, during the time allowed

for composition and dictation, the answers being laid before the Science

Demonstrator at his next visit.

The subjects taught have been Elementary Mechanics and Electricity

to the boys ; Domestic Economy and Physiology to the girls. Lessons
are now being given to about 1,500 boys and 1,000 girls in twenty-nine

schools ; and with the increase of the schools, the system will doubtless
be extended by the Board. The plan framed does not, it must be ob-

served, give scientific instruction in a few special schools, but ^provides it

in all schools under the Board as a part of the regular worh of the school.

  --In schools situated in the poorer localities for which the charge

--made for the whole work of the school is only one penny per week the

science instruction is as cai'efully given as in the others, and secures the

intensest interest and attention of the scholars.

Classes in connection with the Science and Art Department are also

established for pupil teachers in the service of the Board.

    Tested by experience, the success of the scheme may be regarded as

thoroughly established.

The introduction of scientific instruction has added new life to the

general work of the schools. The intellectual interest of the scholars has

been aroused, and the papers on the ordinary subjects of elementary

Aeducation have become more numerous.       school which passes a good

examination in science is found, as a matter of fact, to pass a better

examination than ever before in writing, reading, and arithmetic.

Experiments being performed in the sight of the scholars, and appa-

ratus being actually shown to them, the instruction does not in the

slightest degree partake of the nature of ' cram.'

     Special examinations have been conducted by an independent examiner

-- --Professor Poynting, of the Mason Science College and that gentleman

has reported to the Board, with great satisfaction, that the answers to

the questions set have been characterised by intelligent thought. The

actual report made is worth quoting, as a suificient reply to those who

fear lest the introduction of science should mean the increase of mere

mechanical ' cram.

    ' Hardly any of the questions in my paper could have been answered

without independent thought on the part of the candidates, and I had

very few answers showing a want of such thought. The boys showed

that they had seen and understood the experiments which they described

-- --that they had been taught to reason for themselves upon them and

that they were not merely using forms of words which they had learnt

without attaching physical ideas to them.'

The system described is economical as well as efiective. The apparatus

being carried from school to school, the great expense of providing a set
316 EEPOKT-- 1883.

of good apparatus for each scliool is saved. In tlie central laboratory the-

work for all the sixty-two departments in which lessons are given i&

prepared.

The chief demonstrator is  paid  3001. ;  the  first  assistant  1501.                          and
                                                                                             ;

second assistant llOL ; while two juniors receive 10s. and 12s. per week.

The cost of the apparatus has been about 250?. or 300Z.

It would be quite possible for a number of schools in country districts-

to join together and secure the same advantage at a trifling cost to each.

     The essential parts of the system are : (1) the employment of thoroughly:

scientific men to give experimental demonstrations, and, (2) the introduc-

tion of elementary science as a regular course of instruction.

In order to prepare the way for the Science Teaching in the upper

standards, the teachers of the infants' schools and of the lower standards-

in the upper schools are instructed to make their object lessons systematic,

Aalthough of course divesting them of technicality.   series of suggestions

for systematic object lessons has been prepared by the Science Demoni-

strator and circulated among the teachers, so that the scholars may be

gradually led to the work of the upper standards.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Sir Frederick Bramwele.

   (Secretary), Dr. A. W. Williamson, Professor Sir William

   Thomson, Mr. St. John Vincent Day, Sir William Siemens,

   Mr. C. W. Merrifield, Dr. Neilson Hancock, Sir Frederick

   Abel, Captain Douglas G-alton, Mr. E. H. Carbutt, Mr. Macrory,

   Mr. H. Trueman Wood, Mr. W. H. Barlo^v, and Mr. A. T.
   Atchison, appointed for the purpose of tvatchi7ig and reporting'

   to the Council on Patent Legislation.

The fact that an Act for the reform of the Patent laws was passed in the
Session just concluded, has of necessity thrown a good deal of work
upon the Committee. It has met five times, and nearly every member-
of it was present at one or more of the meetings. The following gentle-

--men have been added : Sir John Lubbock, Mr. Alfred Carpmael, Mr. B,.

E. Webster, Q.C., and Mr. Theodore Aston, Q.C.
     Besides the Government Bill, which was introduced on February 19,.

the Bill prepared by the Society of Arts, and referred to in previous
reports of this Committee (see British Association ' Report,' 1881,
p. 222, and 1882, p. 310), was again introduced by Sir John Lub-
bock, and Mr. Anderson also introduced a Bill generally similar to
those he has brought forward in former years. . The last two Bills were
read a second time, but were not further proceeded with. After the
second reading of the Government Bill, it was referred to the Grand
Committee on Trade, by which some alterations of a more or less im-
portant chai'acter were made. The final stages were run through rather
rapidly, and, in one of the last weeks of the Session, it passed through
the House of Lords. The speed with which, after the long delay in the
earlier part of the Session, the Bill was (tarried through Parliament,
rendered it by no means easy to obtain amendment in it, and indeed
                        ON PATENT LEGISLATION.                  317

the risk of the Bill not passing if many changes were introduced,

afforded a reason to the President of the Board of Trade for not accept-

ing many alterations pressed upon him from various quarters.

     It does not appear desirable to lengthen this report by giving an

abstract of the Bill, since its main provisions have already been pub-

lished in the technical nevrspapers and elsewhere. An excellent summary

is to be found in the Society of Arts ' Journal ' for September 7, 1883.
     The Committee felt that the Government Bill compared unfavourably

Tfith that of the Society of Arts, and this opinion was shared in many
other quarters. Had the Government consented to accept that Bill, or

had they, at all events, been willing to adopt certain of its provisions, the

Committee believe that a much better measure would have resulted than
they have any reason to hope the present Act will prove to be. On the

whole, they are not sanguine as to any very beneficial results from the

new law. The reduction of cost in the earlier stages of a patent has
ensured the popularity of the Act in certain quarters, but it remains to
be seen how far the actual process will be cheapened, and to what extent

the new provisions for opposition, &c., will entail counterbalancing
expenses. The substitution of a single working head, instead of ex-officio

Commissioners, is an obvious advantage, but the reform has not gone

nearly far enough, for the new * Controller ' is to be a mere departmental

official, subordinate to several distinct authorities, instead of possessing

independent power. The provisions for applications for patents contain

Asome minor improvements.          British patent is no longer to be affected

by the duration of a corresponding foreign patent. The practice of

' racing for the Seal,' trying to get a later application sealed before an

earlier one, is abolished. The system proposed for the examination

of specifications is incomplete, and will probably be found to be of slight

value, while it is very likely to give considerable additional trouble to

the inventor. The provisions for opposition appear most objectionable,

and will certainly press very hardly on the poorer class of inventors.

Those for amendment and disclaimer are improvements on the present

system. That the jurisdiction of the Privy Council in the question of the

extension of patents is preserved, appears to the Committee a matter
for regret. The position of inventors as regards the Crown is some-

what improved, but it is manifestly unfair that the Treasury should be

the tribunal to decide upon the terms on which the Crown may use

inventions.

     This Committee co-operated with the Patent Committee of the

Society of Arts in endeavouring to improve the Bill, and, in order to

bring their views before the Government, they sought interviews with

the  President of  the  Board  of  Trade, and  with  the  Lord  Chancellor
                                                                                                                   ;

they believe their eSbrts have not been without good result. On both

occasions time did not admit of their asking the sanction of the Council

of the Association, and they therefore were obliged to go as a Committee

merely, and not as representing the Association, or with the authority

such sanction would have given, had it been obtained. Care was taken

that this was definitely stated.

     The Committee think it well that they should be reappointed for the
purpose of watching and reporting upon the working of the new Act.

     The Committee would be glad if they could be allowed a grant of 51.

to cover the various expenses, which otherwise (as in the past year)

have to be defrayed by individual members.
318 REPOET-- 1883.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Sir Joseph Whitworth,
    Sir William Siemens, Sir Frederick Bram\\"ell, ]Mr. A. Stroh,

   Mr. Beck, Mr. W. H. Preece, Mr, E. Crompton, Mr. E. Eigg,
   Mr. A. Le Neve Foster, Mr. Latimer Clark, Mr. H. True-
   man Wood {Secretary), Mr. Buckney, and Sir William Thomson,

   appointed for the purpose of determining a Gauge for the
   manufacture of the various small Scretvs used in Telegraphic and
   Electrical Apparatus, in Clockwork, and for other analogous

    pjurposes.

The Committee regret that it proved impossible for them to complete
their report, recommending a series of screw threads, in time for the
present meeting of the Association. They therefore content themselves

with asking to be reappointed, in the hope that a little additional time-
will enable them to finish their work.

Report of the ' Local Scientific Societies ' Comonittee, consisting of
   Mr. Francis Galton (Chairman), the Eev. Dr. Crossket, Mr.

   C. E. De Eance, Mr. H. Gr. Fordham (Secretary), Mr. John

    Hopkinson, Mr. E. Meldola, Mr. A. Eamsay, Professor Sollas,

   Mr. G. J. Symons, and Mr. W. Whitak.ee, o.ppointed by the

    Council in comfjliance with the folloiving resolution referred to
    the Council by the General Committee :

           That the Council he empowered to appoint a Committee, as recom.
       mended in their Bepoii adopted lnj the General Committee on August 23,
       in order to draiv iip suggestions upon methods of more systematic observa-
       tion and plans of operation for Local Societies, together ivith a more
       uniform mode of publication of the results of their work. It is recom-
       mended that this Committee should draw up a list of Local Societies-
       which puhlisli their proceedings.

The Committee have communicated with all the societies known to
them which aeppar to fall under the designation of 'Local Scientific

Societies which publish their proceedings,' giving to this definition a
somewhat liberal interpretation, and they submit a tabular list of these
societies with notes of their publications and other particulars. They
are about 170 in number, and seem, from their rules and publications,

to be centres whence local scientific information may conveniently be

obtained.

     The Local Societies differ widely in character. Those which are
established in large towns, and are not particularly well situated for
carrying on systematic local investigations, are often of high scientific
rank, and their affairs are administered in a business-like manner by a

regular staff. On the other hand, there are numerous smaller societies
                                                 'local scientific societies.'                                                                                                           3 19'

and field clubs, scattered over the country, which are excellently situated'

for conducting local investigations, and are iu many cases doing valuable

work, but of which so little is generally known that it has often been,

difficult to discover their official addresses.

In some parts of the country the smaller societies either group them-

selves into what is practically a federation, or else affiliate themselves to

some large society in their district, and the Committee think that if the

Local Societies could more generally be induced to group themselves round

what might be described as local sub-centres, it would not be difficult to

devise methods of uniting the representatives of those sub-centres in the

performance of interesting and important duties during the meetino-s of the

British Association, with the final efliect of establishing systematic local

investigation throughout the country, and uniformity in the modes of

publishing the results. The recommendations of the Committee will tend

wholly in this direction, because, although they have considered many

plans of fulfilling their instructions in a direct manner, no plan recom-

mends itself to them as superior to this indirect method in its capacity

for producing valuable and durable effects.

The Committee do not suggest any new topics for systematic investi-

gation, but confine themselves to giving a few examples of what these

topics are, taken from amongst those assigned to Committees of the

Association during the past five years, and arranged in the order of the

--Sections that are severally concerned in them : (A) Luminous meteors

It can hardly be doubted that numerous systematic investigations of

a local character will continue to be carried on, and that their successful

prosecution would result in important gains to science. Neither does it

appear doubtful that the successful prosecution of such investigations by

the smaller Local Societies would be greatly encouraged and facilitated

by the general interest shown in their work by the more influential societies

in their neighbourhood, by a watchful oversight, a readiness to discuss
and publish results, and by the personal influence of their leading members.
The Committee offer the recommendations they are about to make in the

trust that they will serve to remind the more important Local Societies of
the high and useful function they are able to perform by enterino- into
friendly and helpful relations with the small and scattered societies of

their respective districts, and by offering themselves as their scientific

representatives wherever representation may be necessary.

Believing that the British Association is fitted by its constitution and

position to become an organising centre of local scientific work, and that

through an extension of the system of delegation from Scientific Societies
which has already been recognised in the Rules of the Association this

object may be attained, the Committee venture to make the following

proposals, thrown into the form of Rules, which, if approved, may be

inserted amongst the Rules of the Association, with such amendments in

the existing Rules as may be necessary in consequence.
:320  --REPORT 1883.

                              ' Suggested New Rules.

                                             ' Corresponding Societies.

     ' (1). Any Society is eligible to be placed on the List ot Con-osponding

 Societies of the Association which undertakes local scientific investiga-
tions, and publishes notices of the results of such investigations, especially
if they are such as are carried on by Committees of the Association.

     ' (2). Application may be made by any Society to be placed on the

list of Corresponding Societies. Applications must be addressed to the
 Secretary on or before the first of June preceding the annual meeting
at which it is intended they should be considered, and must be accom-
panied by specimens of the publications of the results of the local
scientific investigations recently undertaken by the Society.

    A' (3). Corresponding Societies Committee shall be appointed by the

'Council for the purpose of considering these applications, as well as

for that of keeping themselves generally informed of the annual work of
the Corresponding Societies, and of superintending the preparation of
·a list of the papers published by them. This Committee shall make an
-annual report to the Committee of Recommendations, and shall suggest
such additions or changes in the List of Corresponding Societies as they

--may think desirable, subject only to the conditions (1) That the num-

ber of Societies on the list shall not exceed that which may be from time

to time prescribed by the Council; (2) that the intended removal of
any Society from the list shall not take effect until immediately before
the commencement of the next annual meeting.

      ' (4). Every Corresponding Society shall transmit each year on or
before the first of June, to the Secretary of the Association, a copy of its
publications during the preceding twelve months, and shall at the same
time return propei-ly filled up a schedule, which will be issued by the
Secretary of the Association, and which will contain a request for such

information with regard to the Societ}- as may be desirable.

      ' (5). There shall be inserted in the Annual Report of the Association
a List, in an abbreviated form, of the papers published by the Corre-
sponding Societies during the past twelve months which contain the
results of the local scientific work conducted by them ; those papers only
being included which refer to subjects coming under the cognisance of
one or other of the various Sections of the Association.

    A' (6). Corresponding Society shall have the right to nominate any

one of its members, who is also a member of the Association, as its
Delegate to the annual meeting of the Association, who shall be for the
time a member of the General Committee. The appointment of a

Delegate to any annual meeting must be formally notified to the Secre-
tary of the Association by the Seci-etary of the Corresponding Society
not later than the first of July preceding that meeting.

                     ' Conference of Delegates of Corresponding Societies.

     ' (7). The Delegates of the various Corresponding Societies shall
constitute a Conference, of which the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, and
Secretaries shall be annually appointed by the Council, and of which the
members of the Corresponding Societies Committee shall be ex officio
members.
       'local scientific societies.'  321

     ' The Conference of Delegates shall be summoned by the Secretary of

the Association to hold one or more meetings during each annual meeting

of the Association, and shall be empowered to invite any member or

associate to take part in the meetings.
     'The Secretaries of each Section shall be instructed to transmit to

the Secretaries of the Conference of Delegates copies of any recommen-
dations forwarded by the Presidents of Sections to the Committee of
Recommendations bearing upon matters in which the co-operation of
Corresponding Societies is desired ; and the Secretaries of the Con-
ference of Delegates shall invite the authors of these recommendations to
attend the meetings of the Conference and give verbal explanations of
their objects and of the precise Avay in which they would desire to have

them carried into effect.
     ' It shall be the duty of the Delegates to make themselves familiar

with the purport of the several recommendations as brought before the

Conference, in order that they and others who take part in the meetings
may be able to bring the recommendations clearly and favourably before
their respective Societies. The Conference may also discuss propositions

bearing on the promotion of more systematic observation and plans of
operation, and of greater uniformity in the mode of publishing results.'

     The Committee believe that the distinction accorded to a Society
through its selection and formal recognition by the British Association as

one of its Corresponding Societies, the advantage of a widely-circulated

notice of its local work in so important a volume as the Report of the
British Association, and the honourable and useful duties assigned to
its Delegate, would give considerable value to the title.

     They also anticipate that a Society which had asked for and received

recognition as a representative centre of the scientific institutions in its
district, would be thereby stimulated to exercise that very creditable and

important function with increased zeal and efficiency. The result would
be to strengthen the mutual relations of the larger and the smaller
Societies, to ensure the encouragement of any disposition to co-operate
in systematic investigations, and to establish a practice of printing the
scattered results obtained by the smaller Societies of any district in a
consolidated form in the publications of their leading Society.

     Finally, the Committee believe that the annual meetings of the pro-
posed Conference of Delegates, under the chairmanship of a distinguished

member of the Association, would have large influence in harmonising
the action of their several Societies, without in any way tending to
compromise their independence, and that they would offer a facility
that does not now exist for the natural and healthy growth of a federa-
tion between remote Societies which have no more direct bond of union

than through the British Association.

On some Results of Photographing the Solar Corona withoa.it an
  Eclipse. By William Huggins, D.G.L., LL.B., F.R.S.

                                                    [Plate XI.]

     [A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso
                                             among the Reports.]

Last December (1882) I had the honour of presenting to the Royal

ASociety a note on ' Method of Photographing the Solar Corona with-

--out an Eclipse.' In that paper I say : ' If by screens of coloured glass

Hor other absorptive media the region of the spectrum between Gr and

could be isolated, then the coronal light which is here very strong would
have to contend only with a similar range of refrangibility of the light

scattered from the terrestrial atmosphere. It appeared to me by no means

improbable that under these conditions the corona would be able so far to

hold its own against the atmospheric glare, that the parts of the sky im-
mediately about the sun where the corona was present would be in a

sensible degree brighter than the adjoining parts where the atmospheric
light alone was present. It was obvious, however, that in our climate

and low down on the earth's surface, even with the aid of suitable screens,
the addition of the coronal light behind would be able to increase but in

a very small degree the illumination of the sky at those places where it
was present. There was also a serious drawback from the circumstance
that although this region of the spectrum falls just within the range of

vision, the sensitiveness of the eye for very small differences of illumina-

tion in this region near its limit of power is much less than in more

favourable parts of the spectrum ; at least such is the case with my own

eyes. There was also another consideration of importance ; the corona is
an object of very complex form, and full of details depending on small
differences of illumination, so that even if it could be glimpsed by the eye,

it could scarcely be expected that observations of a sufficiently precise

character could be made to jjermit of the detection of the more ordinary
changes which are doubtlessly taking place in it. These considerations
induced me not to attempt eye-observations, but from the first to use

photography, which possesses extreme sensitiveness in the discrimina-
tion of minute differences of illumination, and also the enormous advantage
of furnishing a permanent record from an instantaneous exposure of the
most complex forms.'

      The photographs described in that paper were obtained with a reflect-
ing telescope of the Newtonian form by Short, and the restriction of the

G Hlight to the small range of refrangibility from about to was effected

by the use of screens of coloured glass, or by a cell containing a solution
 of potassic permanganate. The photographs showed distinctly coronal
 appearances around the sun, and I was permitted by Captain Abney,
 F.R.S. , who made a careful examination of the plates, to say that, in his

opinion, the solar corona had been photographed on my plates with an

 uneclipsed sun.
      I purpose in this paper to give an account of some further experiments

 founded on the sa,me method made during the spring and summer of the

 present year.

     I am indebted to Miss Lassell for the loan of a seven-foot Newtonian
 telescope made by the late Mr. Lassell. The speculum, which is seven
ON PHOTOGEAPHING THE SOLAR CORONA.  347

inches in diameter, possesses great perfection of figure, and still retains
its original fine polish. I decided not to use more than 3^ inches of the
central portion of the speculum, partly for the reason that a larger
amount of light would be difficult of management, and partly because

this restriction of the aperture would enable me to adopt the arrange-

ment which is shown in the diagram.

     It will be seen at once from an inspection of the diagram that in this
arrangement the disadvantage of a second reflection by the small mirror
is avoided, as is also the mechanical inconvenience of tilting the speculum

within in the tube as in the ordinary form of the Herschelian telescope.
The speculum h remains in its place at the end of the tube a, d. The small
plane speculum and the arm carrying it were removed. The open end of
the tube is fitted with a mahogany cover. In this cover at one side is a

circular hole /, 3^" diameter, for the light to enter ; below is a similar hole
over which is fitted a framework to receive the ' backs ' containing the
photographic plates, and also to receive a frame with fine ground-glass

for putting the apparatus into poi=ition. Immediately below, towards

the speculum, is fixed a shutter with an opening of adjustable width,

which can be made to pass across more or less rapidly by the use of

india-rubber bands of different degrees of strength. In front of the
opening/ is fixed a tube c, six feet long, fitted with diaphragms, to restrict
as far as possible the light which enters the telescope to that which

comes from the sun and the sky immediately around it. The telescope-
tube a, a, is also fitted with diaphragms, which are not shown in the
diagram, to keep from the plate all light, except that coming directly from
the speculum. It is obvious that, when the sun's light entering the tube
at /falls upon the central part of the speculum, the image of the sun will
be formed in the middle of the second opening at d, about two inches
from the position it would take if the tube were directed axially to the
sun. The exquisite definition of the photographic images of the sun
shows, as was to be expected, that this small deviation from the axial
direction, two inches in seven feet, does not affect sensibly the perform-
ance of the mirror. The whole apparatus is firmly strapped on to the

refractor of the equatorial, and carried with it by the clock motion.
     The performance of the apparatus is very satisfactory. The photo-

graphs show the sun's image sharply defined ; even small spots are seen.

When the sky is free from clouds, but presents a whity appearance from

the large amount of scattered light, the sun's image is well-defined upon
a uniform background of illuminated sky, without any great increase of
illumination immediately about it. It is only when the sky becomes clear
and blue in colour that coronal appearances present themselves with more

or less distinctness.

    In my earlier work with this apparatus I used cells containing
348 . KEroRT-- 1883.

potassic permanganate in solution, whicli were placed close to tlie sensitive

surface, and between it and the shutter. I was much troubled by the

rapid decomposition of the potassic permanganate under the influence of

the sun's light. When apparently clear to the eye, a lens revealed

minute particles which precipitated themselves upon the glass plates of

the cell, and gave an appearance of structure to any coronal appearance

which was on the plate. Besides, any diminution of the transparency of

the solution, by the presence of minute particles would produce scattered

light on the plate.

I then tried a solution of iodine in carbon disulphide, but the same

inconvenience presented itself. Very soon under the sun's light the

solution was found by examination with a lens to show signs of com-

mencing decomposition.

Even when the solution was sensibly clear, there was some disadvantage

from unavoidable imperfection of polish of the surfaces of the plates which

reveals itself under the strong light in which they are placed. If, however,

the violet (pot) glass wbich I used at first could be obtained annealed and

free from the imperfections usually present in it, it would serve most

usefully as a selective screen.

For these reasons, after some months' work, I decided to give up the

use of absorbing media, and I came to the conclusion that the advantages

they present, which are doubtless considerable, are more than balanced by

the possible false appearances which they might give rise to if the solu-

tions were not in a condition of perfect transparency.

As, for the reasons stated above, it seemed desirable to avoid placing

media of any kind before the sensitive surface, the selective power upon

the light had to be sought in the nature of the sensitive surface itself.
The suggestion of staining the film presented itself, but after consultation

with Captain Abney, I decided to try an emulsion containing silver

chloride only. Captain Abney kindly prepared some silver chloride

emulsion for me, and the plates were developed with a solution of ferrous-

citro-oxalate.

The silver chloride film, according to Captain Abney, is strongly

sensitive to light from li to fl, and hardly at all beyond H.

Since the middle of July these plates have been used as well as the

Aordinary silver bromide gelatine plates.  comparison of the two kinds

of plates, when used under similar conditions, shows a decided advantage

for this work in favour of the silver chloride.

All the plates were backed with a solution of asphaltura in benzole.

For the purpose of screening the sensitive surface from the intensely

bright image of the sun, small circular disks of thin brass were turned

about -gJ^ inch larger in diameter than the sun's image. The brass disk was

held close before the sensitive surface by a fine metal arm when the sun

was taken in the middle of the field, and attached to the inner edge of a

circular diaphragm when the sun's image was placed towards the side of

the field.

   A comparison of photographs taken under similar conditions with

and without the disk showed less advantage in favour of the disk than was

anticipated. Indeed, it may be that, with the short exposures given, the

scattered light, which comes upon the plate when the sun's image falls

directly on the sensitive surface, may be favourable to the setting up of

the photographic action by the comparatively feeble coronal light.

In consequence of the number of diaphragms which it was found

desirable to introduce into the apparatus for the purpose of preventing

any light but that from the sun and the sky immediately around it from

reaching the plate, the extent of field in which the full aperture was in

use was small. For this reason it was found of advantage to place the

sun's image near the margin of the diaphragm limiting the field, and

afterwards to combine the photographs, taken in four different positions.
     The moving shutter being placed very near the sensitive surface, and

practically in the focal plane, could not give rise to eSects of diffraction

upon the plate. Besides, the opening in the shutter was never less than

half an inch in width, and often as much as an inch or even more, accord,

ing to the sensitiveness of the plates used.

     The most serious difficulty with which I have had to contend has been

the absence of clear skies. On many days of bright sunshine the wind

has been in a northerly direction bringing here the smoke of London,

which produces a whity condition of sky, through which it was obviously

hopeless to expect the coronal light to show itself upon the plates.

The few occasions of a better condition of sky were for the most part

of short duration and did not allow time for a large number of photographs

to be taken.

     During the summer about fifty photographs have been obtained,
which show photographic action about the sun of a more or less coronal

character.

    I placed these plates in the hands of Mr. "Wesley, who has had very
great experience in making drawings from the photographs taken during

several solar eclipses, with the request that he would make a drawing for

each day on which suSicient photographs had been taken, combining the

results of the different photographs in one drawing. This was desirable,
as whenever a sufiicient duration of sunshine permitted, photographs were

taken on silver chloride films, as well as on silver bromide plates; some

photographs were taken with the sun screened by the brass disk, others
without it ; also photographs were taken with the sun in different positions
of the field. As a rule, Mr. Wesley has introduced into his drawings

those coronal features only which are common to all the plates taken on

that day.

     The apparatus is attached to the refractor of the equatorial in such a
way that the direction of the length of the plate is in that of a parallel of

declination                                                             a  line, therefore,  across the plate is in a direction north and
                                                                     ;

south, and from the date of the photograph the angle of position of the

sun's axis can be found. On Mr. Wesley's drawings the orientation is

marked, as well as the position of the sun's axis. Four drawings accom-

pany this paper. In most of the negatives more structure than is shown

in the drawings is suspected when the plates are carefully examined.

I regretted greatly that on May 6, the day of the solar eclipse, the sky

here was very unfavourable. Up to the time of writing this paper I have

not seen the photographs taken during the eclipse. Mr. Wesley wishes

me to state that he has not seen the photographs or any drawings of the

eclipse, and that therefore he has been wholly without bias in making his

drawings from my plates. If these drawings are compared with the

photographs taken during the eclipse, it should be borne in mind that

the absence of sky illumination during the eclipse would allow a larger

part of the fainter and more distant regions of corona to be photographed,

and that any peculiar conformations or detailed structure of these outer

portions could not be expected to be seen on my plates. The comparison
                                    --

350             REPORT 1883.

should be restricted to the regions of the corona at corresponding distances
from the snn's limb. It is probable that the short exposure eclipse nega-

tives "vvill be found to admit of comparison with my plates better than

those exposed for a longer time.

the strongly marked details could be made out on his drawings, a rift
near the north pole being especially noticeable ; this was in a photograph

taken on April 3, in which the detail of the northern hemisphere is best
shown, while the detail of our southern hemisphere most resembles the
photograph taken on June 6 ; in fact, our negatives seem to hold an inter-

mediate position. Afterwards I went with Dr. Huggins and Mr. Woods
to Burlington House to see the negatives. The outline and distribution

of light in the inner corona of April 3 is very similar to that on our plate
which had the shortest exposure; the outer corona is, however, I think,
hidden by atmospheric glare. As a result of the comparison I should say
that Dr. Huggins's coronas are certainly genuine as far as 8' from the

limb.'

             On LaTYh&s Differential Equation.
              By Professor F. Lindemann, D.Ph. .

[A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso

·',:=,.^,^'  among the Reports.]

It is known that the integration of Lame's equation

%+ + + +4<l-,^)(l-Z;2^)g/ 2[32-^7.2-22(l 7.2) l]^|^=[,i(,,+l)Z;2s

has been perfectly settled by Mr. Fuchs and Mr. Hermite for the parti-
cular case in which n is a whole number. In all the other cases one can
only g^"^& the solutions by development in series, each of which is con-
vergent within a circle, whose centre is to be found in a critical point of
the above equation (viz., in one of the points r=0, z:=l, z=^li~', z=co ),
and whose circumference passes through the next critical point ; it remains
then to establish the relations between the different developments so

=obtained; e.g., one has in the neighbourhood of the point z 0, two

integrals of the form

=and at the point z 1, one has the developments

                   yz=co'+ci'(i-z)+cK_ a-^y-+ ....

                 y^=(l-zy-[bo' + h,\l-z) + h^'(l-zy+ . . .]

     The difficulty which has to be got over is to determine the constants

A, B, D, E in such a manner that the equations

may be satisfied.
    Supposing now that 2?i is a whole number, this problem can be re-

solved in a remarkably simple way by the same method which I have

lately applied' to the differential equation of the functions of the elliptic
cylinder (i.e., Jc=0). Finally, I have arrived thus at the following result.

     First, designating by i/i, y^ the two independent particular integrals
at the point 2=00 which are given by developments of the form

                            »7i=2K7o+yiZ"'+y22"'+ . . .)

                                                 -K-l

there exists a certain binary quartic

which is a function of rational character, not only at the point 2^00 , but
also at the point z=Z;"^. Consequently this function is given by one
single development convergent in all points without a circle of the radius
1, and with the centre r-=0 ; and the convergence is not disturbed by the
critical point z-^lc~-. According to a general formula given by Mr.
Brioschi,' the Hessian covariant, viz., the quartic

is a known function of - also ; one has thei'efore two equations from
which the integrals r;,, i]^ may be found.

    Secondly, I show that one may obtain two other particular integrals

of the form

                                                  Z=z(l-z)(l-r-z)
                  2/2=GVF(z) e ·'fuVz

wherein G, G' are two arbitrary constants, and C designates another con-
stant chosen in a certain given manner ; F(z) is a function of z given by

a development in ascending powers of z, whose convergence is not dis-

=turbed by the point z l, but which is convergent for all points within

the circle with the radius li~^. This series is found directly as a certain
particular integral of that differential equation of the third order, which
is satisfied by the quantities 7/,^, ?/2^ Villi-

    The connection between the functions ?;[, j/2, and now7/1, 7/2 is given
by two relations of the form

                        + +yi--.Krii Xr}2, y2=F1\ v>i2,

wherein the constants *:, X, (i, r may easily be determined by choosing for

z any point within the circle of the radius k~-, and without the circle of

the radius 1.

      So one does not need for the integration of the proposed equation but
two developments in series (viz., those of the functions and F), suppos-
ing that 2n is a whole number.

    An exception will present itself when the constant C (entering in the

formulas for ?/i and 7/2) is just equal to zero; this is the particular case
treated by Mr. Brioschi, loc. cif.

     It is to be remarked that the formulae for y\, yi (but not those for r}^,

r]o) can be applied whatever the value of n may be.
    This seems to me likely to become useful in certain problems relating

to the theory of potentials, in a manner that I intend to explain on another

occasion.

§ 1. Value of Estimates of National Income and National Wealth.

Many attempts have been made to arrive at the annual income of the

people of the United Kingdom ; not, indeed, from any sentiment of

vanity or sheer curiosity, but to obtain the necessary data for the appre-

ciation of many economic and social problems of the greatest practical

importance. But the problem is difficult to solve, because many branches

of income defy any valuation, because different branches of income have

not the same value, because such values are subject to constant fluctua-

tions                          and               because, -when we                                                                          have estimated  the income of     the different

diture of another section. All attempts, moreover, to estimate the income

of the nation can only be of an approximate chai-acter. Enough, indeed,

if we can come within a measurable distance of the real truth.

                                                      § 2. Estimated Amounts of Income and Wealth.

As far back as in the reign of Henry VIII. a general survey was
made of the kingdom, including the number of its inhabitants, their

^ges, -professions, wealth, and other particulars, when the entire income

was estimated at 4,000,000Z.' per annum; which, with a population of

about 5,000,000, gave a proportion of 16*-. per head. In 1822, Lord

Liverpool valued the income of Great Britain at 250,000,000?. ; which,

with a population of 14,400,000, gave a proportion of 17/. per head. In

1854, Mr. M'Culloch ^ estimated the income at 370,000,000/.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 which,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

with a population of 21,600,000, gave a proportion of 17/. per head!

None of these estimates, however, evidently included the incomes of the

labouring classes. Of such income there was but little knowledo-e till

1866, when I began to inquire into, and unite together, their wages and

earnings, and found them amounting to upwards of 400,000,000/. per
annum. In 1868, Mr. Dudley Baxter gave his valuable paper on national

income                                           and  he estimated                                                                     the  total amount for    the United Kingdom                                                                                                                              at

814,000,000/.; which, on a population of 30,000,000, gave a proportion

of 20/. 17s. per head. And in 1881, the population being about

35,000,000, the income has been estimated at 1,000,000,000/. per annum,

or 28/. per head. In a similar manner, calculations have been made of

the capital of the State. Gregory King, in 1688,^ estimated the total

value of England at 650,000,000/. Dr. Becke, in 1798, estimated the

capital                        at                995,000,000/.                                                                         and  in  the same year, Mr. Pitt estimated it at
                                                                                                                                    ;

1,125,000,000^. In 1812 Dr. Colquhoun · estimated the capital value of

the United Kingdom at 2,700,000,000^ In 1842 Mr. Porter ^ estimated
the amount of personal property at 2,200,000,000Z., and of real property

2,382,000,000Z. ; total, 4,582,000,000Z. And in 1878 Mr. Giffen estimated

it at 8,500,000,0007.3

    But these varied estimates are not strictly comparable, however

useful they may be as recording tlie results arrived at at different times

Weby earnest and bond fide labourers in statistical science.                                                                                                                                                                                                       do not

know the method pursued by each, or whether the income of every class

of the community has been duly computed in each case. If we compare

the, income of the people of the United Kingdom at the extreme periods

embraced, making allowance for the altered value of money and the

diflFerence in the purchasing power, the economic pi"ogress, however large,

thereby indicated, may easily be accounted for. But if we compare each

estimate with the preceding one, -the results present some decided

anomalies. Recent estimates have certainly the advantage of the income-

tax assessments, which represent the amount for which the persons

subject to the tax are willing to be rated. And though there may be, in
many cases, the temptation to under-estimate that income so as to escape

the tax in all or in part, still, on the aggregate, the range of error i&

considerably less by this method than by other modes of valuation.

                                                                                          § 3. Changes in the Distribution of Wealth.

    The purpose of this paper, however, is not to examine critically the

estimates already made of the income of the people of the United Kingdom,

nor to offer any exhaustive estimate of my own. For this purpose, the

forthcoming volumes of the ' Report on the Census of 1881 ' will supply

         ON EECENT CHANGES IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH.                                             355

I aim at is to elicit from the materials now at liand some indication of

the recent changes in the distribution of property, more especially in
relation to the estimated income of the labouring classes. Within the
last thirty years great changes have taken place in the economic condi-

--tion of the people. The introduction of free trade or, more correctly
--stated, a more economic financial and commercial policy the great

extension of railways, the discoveries of gold in California and Australia,
the enjoyment of a lengthened period of comparative peace, and the
development of resources in the British colonies and dependencies, have
each and all had surprising effects on the trade and industries of the

realm. Have the higher, middle, and labouring classes participated in
the same proportion in the increasing wealth of the nation ?

                      §4. Classification of the Population.                                           ·

     It is difficult to classify the population under any well-defined cate-

gories. Generally, we have the broad distinction between income tax-
payers and non-income taxpayei's. But the number of income taxpayers
at anj' time is afi"ected by the changes made in the limit of incomes subject
to the tax. In 1798 the tax was levied upon all incomes of 601. and

upwards. Since 1875-6 the lax has been levied only upon incomes of

150Z. and upwards, subject to certain allowances or abatement of duty.

Non-income taxpayers, on the other hand, comprise the lower middle

class and the labouring classes. The more common distinction of society
is the division into the higher, middle, and lower classes. But who are

the higher classes ? Shall we place within this category the large land-
owners only, or shall we include among them those having large incomes

from whatever sources ? Who ai'e the middle classes ? There is a

higher middle and a lower middle class. Our merchants and bankers
pride themselves on being the great middle class. But so are clerks,

teachers, and ministers of religion, having but a small annual income
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

whilst it is a misnomer to distinguish any number of persons as working
classes when we are all workers, some Avith the hand, some with the
mind, and many with both. Moreover, the so-called working classes in-

clude artisans, labourers, domestic servants, &c., &c. Practically we
have four classes of society : first, we may take the aristocracy of wealth

including all having an income of 3,000/. and upwards ; second, the

middle class, those having an income of 500/. to less than 3,000/. ; third,
the lower middle class, those having an income of 150/. and less than

500/. ; and fourth, we have the lower professional or trading classes,
and the labouring classes, having an income of less than 150/.

§ 5. Assessed Incomes of the Middle and Higher Classes, 1851 and 1881.

Let us now see what liglit the Income Tax Returns throw on the dis-

tribution of income among those so assessed in 1851 and 1880 respec-

tively.    An  exact  comparison,  indeed, cannot  be  made                              for, whilst  the
                                                                                      ;

Dclassification under Schedule in 1851 included the incomes of public

companies except mines, qunrries, ironworks, gasworks, I'ailways, water-

Dworks, canals, &c., which were not assessed under Schedule until

1866-67, the classification tor 1879-80 includes trade and professions

only. Still, the comparison in so far as regards the relative incomes at

Dthe two periods may be useful. The return relating to Schedule

refers to Great Britain, aid for the years 1850-51 and 1879-80, is as

follows :

ON KECENT CHANGES IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH. 357

    Some interesting facts may be gathered from this table. First, that

the average amount of assessments of incomes 150/. and upwards in
Schedule J) per person was 424?. in 1880, against 479/. in 1851, indicatino-

greater diffuseness of incomes side by side with a larger total. Secondly^

--that a larger proportion, viz., 85'6 per cent, in 1881, against 80*9 per cent,

in 1850-51 are now assessed with the lower incomes than with the larger
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

--and, thirdly, that a larger proportion of the amount viz., 43 per cent, in

--1880, against 38 per cent, in 1881 is assessed on the lower incomes

than on the higher.

Comparing the proportion of persons assessed with the population of
--Great Britain at the respective periods
                                           viz                  20,900,000  in  1851,  and

 to be true, it is a significant fact that whilst the number of persons in
· the receipt of incomes from 150Z. to 500Z. increased in the thirty years at
 the rate of 136 per cent., the number of persons in the receipt of incomes

 of 3,000Z. and upwards increased only at the rate of 86 per cent.

                   § 6. Relation of Land to other Sources of Wealth.
      It has been asserted in Mr. Henry GeoT'ge's work on ' Progress and
 Poverty,' that the effect of an increasing population upon the distribution
 of wealth is to increase rent, and consequently to diminish the proportion
 of the produce which goes to capital and labour ; and that the reason why,
 in spite of the increase of productive power, wages constantly tend to a
 minimum which gives but a bare living, is that with the increase of pro-
 ductive power rent tends to even greater increase, thus producing a
constant tendency to force down wages. What has been the proportion
of rent of land to the total income of the nation ? Have landowners and
 farmers flourished, and the rest of the people decayed ? Let the following

 comparison of facts answer the question :

            ON RECENT CHANGES IN THE DISTEIBUTION OF WEALTH. 361

sliall we arrive at the number paying income tax under the other sche-
dules ? As I have already stated, Mr. Gripper, of the Inland Revenue,
in a note on the number and average income of income taxpayers in
England and Wales, appended to Mr. Dudley Baxter's paper on national
income, arrived at the conclusion that the number of persons charged

Dunder Schedule being then 297,000, the total number of income

taxpayers could be taken at 900,000, or three times as many. Adopting

this method, we come to the conclusion that the 110,000 persons charged

with income tax under Schedule D in 1850-51, with incomes of 1501. and

upwards, would represent 330,000 as the entire number of income tax-
payers and that the 353,000 similarly charged in 1879-80 under Schedule

                                     ;

D would represent 1,059,000 as the whole number of income taxpayers.
Now multiply these numbers by four and a half to a family, and we have

1,500,000 in 1850-51, and 4,700,000 in 1879-80, as embraced within the

income taxpaying population. On th'e other side of the scale, we have

the great body of the labouring classes, embracing 70 per cent, of the
entire population, or 19,300,000 persons, representing 4,300,000 families,
in 1851, and 24,600,000 persons, or 5,400,000 families, in 1881. Take

the difference between these two sets of figures, and we have the lower

--middle classes viz., 6,900,000 persons, or 1,500,000 families, in 1851,

and 5,900,000 persons, or 1,300,000 families, in 1881.

    Now place against these numbers the income of each class at the

respective period, adding 6 per cent, for the probably assessable income

               § 11. Relative iTnprovement of different Classes of Society.

     The relative condition of classes in the United Kingdom is by no
means immutable. Wealth is attainable by labour and economy, and no

class is shut out from the competition. Nay, more, under the British
political system there is no right, no advantage, and no avenue to
honour, -which is not fi'ee and open to all alike. Let there be only
perseverance and economy, talent and wisdom, self-mastery and self-
restraint, honour and virtue, and the ascent from the lowest to the highest

rank, though often rugged and steep, is barred to no one. What is it

that the labouring classes should really aim at ? Release from labour ?

A greater amount of political power ? Ah, no ! The true elevation of the

labouring man consists in an increasing energy of his thinking powei's, a

greater force of moral purpose, a greater culture of the intellect, a greater
refinement of manner and taste, above all in an increasing capacity to
repel what is depressing and to attract what is ennobling in his daily
intercourse of life.

  --Note. Wages in the Weaving Branch of the Cotton Trade. The pre-

sident of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce (Mr. G. Lord), in

response to the desire expressed by the delegates of the weaving branch

at their meeting at Ashton-under-Lyne, has forwarded us the following as

the data on which he based his statement to the chamber on Thursday

last. The figures, as he explained, show the wages earned per week

of 60 hours up to 1874, and of 56^ hours since :

     Increase : Weavers alone in 1883 on 1850, 67| per cent.; winders, 45| per cent.
weavers and winders together, 57i- per cent.

     This is a large mill, and the weavers' earnings per week are arrived
at by taking the total earnings of the shed, and dividing that sum by the
number of weavers employed. The reduction in earnings of weavers in
1870 was due to the fact that the material used at that time was not so
good as that in use immediately before and since.

        Amongst the proposals which have from time to time occupied the atten-
         tion of engineers and capitalists, the bridging and tunnelling of rivers
         and estuaries, in order to establish dii'ect communication between im-
         portant towns or districts, have of late years occupied a prominent place^
         and, if practical results have only in one or two instances been attained,
         this cannot be attributed to any want of belief in the value of such con-
         nections, but rather to the inherent difficulties and costliness of the
        necessary works. The towns of Liverpool and Birkenhead, having
        together a population of some 750,000 persons, bound by the closest ties-

of commercial interest, and possessing the finest docks and harbours in

the world, still remain separated by the river Mersey, a deep tidal stream,

some 1,300 yards in width, the interchange of traffic, amounting annually

to about 26,000,000 of passengers and 750,000 tons of goods, being

effected by means of steam ferries only. As long ago as 1865 it was felt

that this condition of affairs seriously interfered with trade, and several

Aproposals were put forward with a view to meeting the difficulty.

high-level bridge, and a railway tunnel crossing under the Mersey some

distance above the towns, were alike considered and set aside, but, in the

year 1866, the Mersey Railway Company was incorporated, with power

to construct a pneumatic railway from Woodside, in Birkenhead, to

Church Street, in Liverpool. By a further Act in 1871 the pneumatic

system was laid aside and an ordinary railway authorised, the powers

being also extended from Woodside to a junction with the joint railway

belonging to the London and North-Western and the Great Western

Railway Companies at Green Lane, in Tranmere. In the year 1882 the

point of junction was altered, and powers taken to extend in Liverpool

from Church Street to Waterloo Place, in immediate contiguity with the

Central station of the Cheshire Lines Committee, and, by an Act of the

present session, further capital powers were granted to the Company. It
was not until December 1879 that it was found possible practically to

begin operations                                                                            and, although the sinking of the shafts and driving  of

the heading hereinafter described was then commenced, the organisation

of the company upon its present basis, with the Right Hon. Cecil Raikes,

M.P., as chairman, the Right Hon. Edward Pleydell Bouverie, F.R.S., as

deputy chairman, and Messrs. Boutcher, Hubbard, Mott, and Cavendish

Taylor as directors, Major Isaac and John Waddell as contractors, Mr.
James Brunlees and the author as engineers, and Mr. Archibald H.

Irvine as resident engineer, was only effected in July 1881, since which
time the works have been vigorously prosecuted. The authorised railway

is 3 miles 8j chains in length, and will extend as a double line of railway
from the junction with the joint railways at Tranmere to a terminal

station in Waterloo Place, Liverpool, adjoining the Central station, with

intermediate stations at Green Lane, Borough Road, and Hamilton

Square, in Birkenhead, and at James Street, in Liverpool. Operations
were commenced by sinking shafts on each side of the river, and just one

mile apart, to such a depth, viz., about 180 feet below the level of the quay,
as was necessary to ensure the efficient drainage of the lowest part of the

tunnel. These shafts were both originally intended to be 15 feet in diameter

when lined, but the Birkenhead shaft has been increased to 17 feet 6 inches
in diameter. The Liverpool shaft passes for a short distance through made
ground, and then through the red sandstone of the district, which at this

point yields a considerable quantity of brackish water. At the bottom
there is a pumping sump of 12 feet in depth, and a standage heading 33
yards in length, to form a safety reservoir in case of any sudden accumu-

lation of water in the workings. It has been found necessary to tub
this shaft and the standage heading with cast-iron tubbing, which
involved some difficult fitting where the shaft widens out for the clack

and bucket doors of the pumps. The Birkenhead shaft, also provided
with a sump and standage heading, passes through the solid sandstone
rock, which only yields any considerable quantity of water for a short
distance, which has been tubbed against wedging cribs, the remainder of

the shaft being unlined. The shafts could not be placed upon the centre

                                                                                            BB2

line of the tunnel, no land being available, and each is therefore connected
with the drainage heading by a cross cut forming at Liverpool nearly a
rio'ht angle (97 deg.), and at Birkenhead an obtuse angle (133 deg.),
with the heading itself The centre line of the tunnel having been
ranged across the river by means of a transit instrument, and permanently
marked on either shore, the angles and lengths of the cross-cats were
carefully measured and the work transferred to below ground by means
of plumb-lines hung in the pumping shafts. These shafts were so
crowded that base-lines of 12 feet only could be obtained. The lines

consisted  of  fine  hard-drawn  German  silver  wire,                  in.  in  diameter.
                                                                  -fjj

This was selected on account of its tensile strength, combined with free-

dom from corrosion by water. There was a slow-motion screw at the

point of suspension for adjusting the wires laterally, and thereby bringing

them into exact position. The bobs at the ends of the plumb-lines were

33 lbs. in weight, and were hung in buckets of water to steady them.

The setting out by this method was checked twice over, with but very

little variation, and it is anticipated that the lines will meet very closely.

In the Birkenhead shaft, where there were many obstacles, and where it

was therefore difficult to see whether the lines were hanging free, they

circuit with the lines, the bobs hanging free in the air, one pole of the

battery was put to earth, the other being connected with the plumb-line.

If making earth by contact at any point the galvanometer was deflected,

the wet condition of the shaft ensuring the making of good earth. If
free there was no current shown. From each shaft is being driven a

heading or drainage gallery, rising with gradients of 1 in 500 and 1 in

900 towards the middle of the river, and connected, at intervals, with

the main tunnel by bore-holes. The portion of this heading which is

executed by hand is taken out 10 feet 4 inches in diameter, and lined

with brickwork in cement 14 inches thick, thus leaving a net diameter of

8 feet. Below the invert, and for the purpose of clearing the water from

the brickwork during construction, a pipe-trench is cut in the rock to

receive pipes 18 inches in diameter. An attempt has been made, with

some success, to stop back a portion of the water by iron cribs and brick-

work in the drainage headings. Cast-iron rings, of hollow box section,

being some 18 inches on the bed and 6 inches deep, have been placed at

intervals, one at each end of a section of brick lining, the rock being cut

oat sufficiently large in diameter to receive them. The ring or crib being

placed in position, and standing vertical, was tightly wedged all round

the outside edge between the crib and the rock with wood wedging, until

this became so compact that a chisel would not enter it. The brickwork

lining between the two cribs was then completed, and the whole made

tight. The intention was then to seal up the two ends, and confine the

water to that particular section, and so prevent its passage along between

the brickwork and the rock on to the nest section. Were the rock

thoroughly impervious, the result would be perfect, but, in the case under

notice, a considerable proportion of the water penetrated through the

rock at the back of the cribs. Instead of using cribs, close building in

brick is now being resorted to, the rock having beeu first carefully

trimmed all round. If carefully done, this baffles the water to a large

extent, and is far less costly than the method above described. The pipe-

trench is made good with concrete put in place in bags before setting,

and the invert is constructed with blocks of brickwork prepared on the

surface. Altogether 930 lineal yards of this heading have been driven

by hand, the average speed at each face being 11 yards per week. The

cement was at first mixed in the proportions of three to one, but, upon

testing the work with the head of water, it was not found to be thoroughly

watertight, and the proportion has since been increased to two to one,

with the most satisfactory results. The greatest care is taken to fill any

cavities at the back of the brickwork with sandstone or broken bricks

in cement of the same proportion. In the spring of the present year

arrangements were matured for introducing into the Birkenhead heading

the machine invented by Colonel Beaumont, 11. B., and Captain English,

R.E., which consists of a strong frame some 30 feet long, upon

which is fixed an upper bed which carries the machinery. This upper

bed can be moved forward by a screw-feed on the lower fi-ame, the feed

in the sandstone rock being | inch per revolution, and the speed of the

bore-head about one and a half revolution per minute, being about one-

third the speed at which it can be driven in chalk. When some 4 feet

(J inches have been cut the action of the feed is revei-sed, and, the weight

of the machine being taken by hydraulic jacks, the lower frame is moved

forward ready to recommence operations. The radial arms of the bore-
head are fitted with cutters, or discs of chilled cast iron, which are trun-
cated cones, and which, as they wear, can be slightly turned round, thus

exposing a fresh cutting edge without so frequently incurring the delay

of replacing the cutters. The bore-head is driven by a pair of compressed
air engines, having cylinders 12 inches in diameter and 18 inches stroke,
and running at from 80 to 100 revolutions per minute. The compi'essed
air is supplied at a pressure of 35 to 40 lbs. per square inch by compressors
at the surface, driven by. portable engines. This machinery cuts the
sandstone rock cleanly and accurately to a diameter of 7 feet, delivering
in small pieces. The greatest progress hitherto made has been about five
yards in twenty-four hours, and twenty-four lineal yards in a week of six
working days, and the machine has now driven a total of 260 yards of
heading. The rock thus cut is found to yield much less water than when

explosives ai*e used, so that it has not been necessary to line this portion

of the heading. Only seven men are required to work and tend the

machine, which is fitted with an endless strap and buckets to deliver the
debris into tubs at the tail. The chief difliculties encountered have been
the keeping of the machine in true line and level, the dust caused in the
drier parts of the rock, and the foggy atmosphere resulting from tbe use
of compressed air, together with certain defects in detail, which are
gradually being remedied. Simultaneously with the drainage headings
the main tunnel has been driven forward. The excavation has been
throughout in sandstone rock, the roof being generally excellent, and
requiring but little support. The rock is very solid and homogeneous,
but varies considerably in the quantity of water it yields, thin layers of a
white colour being more porous than the rest. The rock under the river
on the Liverpool side is remarkably dry. The faces under the river are
carried forward by means of a bottom heading, which is first driven by
hand in the usual manner, and from this ' break-ups ' are made to the

--full size of the tunnel not more than 12 feet lineal of excavation are

allowed to be exposed at one time, the brickwork following on as closely
as possible. The excavation under the river is 30^ feet wide by 27^ feet
high, and is lined with brickwork in cement 2 feet 3 inches thick ; the
internal finished dimensions of the tunnel are 26 feet wide and 23 feet
high, recesses for platelayers being placed at intervals. The two inner
rings of brick are of Staffordshire blue, the remaining rings of Burnley
or other approved red brick, the filling of broken stone or bricks, the
whole set in cement, mixed in the proportion of one of cement to two of
sharp sand or gravel. Landwards the lining of the tunnel is reduced in
thickness to 1 foot 6 inches, and then to 1 foot 2 inches. In order to
 leave the main shafts clear for pumping purposes the drainage heading

is now connected with the main tunnel on the Liverpool side by a staple

shaft 9 feet in diameter and 25 feet deep, and a similar connection is
being made on the Birkenhead side. The underground stations at
James Street, Liverpool, and Hamilton Square, Birkenhead, are excavated
in the solid rock, which is then lined with brickwork, and are 400 feet
long and 50 feet wide by 30 feet hisrh from the rails. These will be
lighted by electricity and approached by hydraulic lifts. For the purpose
of keeping the works clear of water, extensive pumping plant has been
erected at Woodside, Birkenhead, and St. George's Dock, Liverpool, and
this has proved most efficient. Owing to the depth of water (90 feet)
in the river Mersey, and the high levels of the towns on either side,

gradients of 1 in 30 are necessary in order to provide a sufficient distance

(tHe average thickness being 40 feet, and tlae minimum 33 feet) between
the bed of the river and the crown of the tunnel. There are four pump-

ing engines, two on the Liverpool and two on the Birkenhead side, of the

horizontal type known as compound differential, invented by Mr. Henry
Davey, and constructed by Messrs. Hathorn, Davey, and Co., of Leeds.

At Liverpool the large engine is capable of raising 288,000 gallons per
hour, and the other 96,000 gallons, whilst at Birkenhead the large engine
will raise 234,000 gallons, and the small one 96,000, making a total from
both sides of 17,136,000 gallons per day. The largest quantity of water
met with has been at Birkenhead, 180,000 gallons, and at Liverpool

210,000 gallons per hour.

    The dimensions of these engines, and of the pumps connected with

them, are given in the following table :

the two lifts being coupled together. When the break occurred in the-

No. 1 lift, the weight of the No. 2 lift was acting with the steam, and

helped  to  aggravate  matters                                      but the accident was chiefly due to the
                                                                 ;

fact that a careless workman had left a nut projecting on the piston,

which, instead of having the usual clearance, actually came in contact

with the cylinder-cover, and consequently fractured it. The engines are

connected with the spears of the pumps by quadrants, which were con-

structed by the Sandycroft Engine Works Company. The dimensions of

those on the Liverpool were somewhat larger than those on the Birken-

head side, owing to the longer stroke of pumps, viz., 10 feet on that

side, but in all other respects their construction is identical. The checks

or sides are made of 1-inch plate iron, thickened up at the ends and

centre where the pins passed through by additional pieces of plate iron.

These checks are stayed to the case of the king-posts with strong lattic-

ing, and in the horizontal portion or levers with stout cast-iron distance-

stays, through which pass 1^-inch bolts. The end pins, to which the

main links of the engine and pumps are attached, are 7 inches in diameter,

and the centre shaft or gudgeon 11 inches in diameter. The length of the

king-post, from centre-shaft to engine-pin, is 15 feet, and from centre-

shaft to pumping- pin 15 feet for the Liverpool and 12 feet for the Birken-

head quadrants. The diagonal stays or tension-rods are 3 inches at the

ends and 4 inches in the middle, and are provided with straps, gibs, and

cotters similar to an engine connecting-rod. This construction enables

the rods to be cottered up very securely, and avoids the play or looseness

often observed when the diagonals have plain eyes. The weight of each

pair of the quadrants, with all the fittings in connection with them, is

about 22 tons. The pumps are ordinary bucket-lift pumps, with spears

in the rising main. The chief difficulty has been the necessity of frequent

renewal of buckets, owing to the water being full of sand. To provide

duplicate power, and to prevent any possible interruption of the works

during repairs to the existing machinery, an additional engine and pump

is being fixed on each side of the river ; and as these are of large size, a

detailed description of them may not be without interest. The pumping

engine is of the ovez'hanging-beam class, patented by Mr. Barclay on

August 30, 1861 , which was adopted because it does not absorb
much ground-space, and also on account of the small liability to accident

which it possesses. It is of the compound type, having a high- and low-

pressure cylinder, firmly bedded to the foundation. The high-pressure

cylinder has a diameter of 36 inches, and the low-pressure cylinder

55 inches, the length of their strokes being 10 feet 6 inches and 13 feet

respectively, both cylinders being double-acting. The balance-beam of

the engine is placed between the foundation-walls. This beam is 19 feet

long from rocking centre to end, the back end being furnished with a box

having sufficient capacity to hold twenty tons of balance- weights ; its

depth is 4-6, and it is composed of jilates of steel 1^ inch thick, securely
bound with distance-pieces of cast iron. The main beam of the engine is

formed of two plates, each 32 feet 6 inches between the extreme centres.

The vibrating columns are at the back end of the engine. There are two-

sets of parallel motion turned and polished bright, one set being required

to keep the low-pressure cylinder-rod travelling parallel, and the other

for the high-pressui-e cylinder piston-rod. There is a large connecting

rod 38 feet 9 inches long between the centres for joining the point of

main beam to point of balance-beam. This rod is composed of oak, with

malleable iron straps, and firmly bolted along its whole length ; it is fitted
with brass bushes, gibs, and cotters at each end. At each side of this rod

there is a malleable iron rod, extending from main beam to a cast-iron

crosshead. This crosshead is placed below the point of balance-beam, and

to it the pump-rods are attached. This arrangement brings the pump-

rods direct on to the main beam, on which there is but 1| inch of lateral

motion, thus avoiding the large swing at the point of balance-beam, and

keeping the rods travelling upwards and downwards almost in a direct

line, a matter of great importance in pumping machinery like the present,

having a stroke of 15 feet. The pump-rods are made of wood, having

four malleable iron plates at each joint. The rods are bolted to malleable

--iron forks, having tapered ends turned and fitted one to the cast-iron

crosshead at top end, and one to the plunger at bottom end, both held in

position by a collar. The plunger pump is of the ordinary kind, having

a stroke of 15 feet. The plunger is 40 inches in diameter, and turned

true throughout its entire length, fitted with two malleable iron hoops

at top end. The suction and delivery valves are of brass, mounted with

strong steel lids having leather faces, also malleable iron guards, and

fishing tackle. The rising main is of suSicient size to allow both valves

to be drawn up from the surface, thereby avoiding much trouble and

inconvenience during repairs ; the working barrel is bored its entire

length slightly larger than the plunger ; the clack seats are provided with

openings, 4 feet 6 inches and 3 feet 9 inches, to allow of easy access to

the valves                                                the doors for these openings are of steel.  The whole pump is

set on two massive cast-iron girders, the suction-pipe passing up between

them                            these girders at each     end  rest on  oak,  which                   is bedded to a cast-

The boilers, eleven in number, have been manufactured by Messrs. Daniel

Adamson and Co. They are of the Lancashire type, being 28 feet long

and 7 feet 6 inches diameter, each boiler having two flues 3 feet diameter,

and each flue crossed by five conical circulating pipes. They are built

for a daily working pressure of 70 lbs. per square inch, and are steel

shell boilers, having all the rivet-holes drilled after the plates are bent

-- --into position that is, into the form they take in the boilers thus

ensuring a perfectly true and parallel hole for the rivet. The edges of the

plates are planed ; the flues are solid welded in the longitudinal seams

the conical circulating pipes are solid welded into the flue-rings, and the

circular joints of flue-rings made with Adamson's anticollapsive flange-

seam. Thus no rivets or edges of plates are exposed to the action of the

flame. The edges of the flange-seam are turned up by machinery. The

boilers are riveted up throughout by special riveting machines. The

shells are double-riveted in the longitudinal seams, and cross-jointed, the

circular seams of shells being double-riveted. The back ends of the

boilers are flanged and riveted to the shells, and the front ends are riveted

to outside angle steel rings. The boilers are properly and strongly stayed

with gusset as well as longitudinal bolt-stays, and fitted with round and

oval manholes, and full complement of mountings and fittings to each

--boiler, the safety-valves to each boiler being two viz., dead-weight valve

and high-steam and low-water valves. Messrs. Adamson and Co. have
made over two thousand steel boilers, and have them working, dating

from twenty years old, with the most satisfactory results. This success

is no doubt greatly due to the fact that Messrs. Adamson and Co. make

it a rule to test strips from every plate put into the boilers, having

special machines of their own design for testing the tensile strength of
the plates. The tunnel is lighted during construction by electric arc
lights. The ventilation is at present secured by air-compressors, by

bratticing, and by the staple-shafts connecting the tunnel and heading,
but it is intended to erect permanent machinery for the mechanical venti-

--lation of the tunnel, through which trains will run at intervals of a few

minutes only. \_Note. The headings were successfully connected January

                             On Manganese Bronze.
                       By P. M. Parsons, M.Inst.C.E.

[A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso among

                                                                 the Eeports.]

Before entering on the immediate subject of this paper, I propose to
give a brief descriptiou of what has previously been done in the same
direction, and to review the theoretical considerations which have led to
the production of manganese bronze.

     Many samples of bronze made by the ancients have been found to
contain a small percentage of iron, but, as far as I am aware, no traces

of manganese have ever been discovered ; it is not unlikely that the
ancients knew that the addition of iron to' bronze would increase its
hai-dness, and introduced it with that view. In more recent times the
combination of iron with the brass alloys seems to have engaged
the attention of inventors considerably, and a few have also introduced
manganese by reducing the black oxide of manganese and combining it
with the copper, but none of these alloys appear to have shown sufficient
advantages to lead to their permanent adoption.

     Among the earliest of these inventors was James Kier, who, as far

back as the year 1779, proposed an alloy of ten parts of iron with 100 of
copper and 75 of zinc. Alloys of a similar character to this, but con-
taining less iron and different proportions of copper and zinc, were sub-

sequently introduced under the name of stereo-metal and aitch-metal, and
Sir John Anderson, late Superintendent of the Royal Gun Factories, and

Inspector of Machinery to the War Department, carried out a number of

experiments with similar alloys, and with some good results, but no
practical applications of any of them appear to have been made. The
addition of iron unquestionably increased the strength and hardness of
these alloys, but the experiments I have made show that they acquire
these qualities at the expense of ductility and toughness, and it is pro-
bably on this account that they have not come into general use. Besides
 these, various other inventors have proposed to combine iron with the
brass alloys, but only Mr. Alexander Parkes, and the late Mr. J. D.
 Morries Stirling, both eminent metallurgists, proposed the use of man-
 ganese and appear to have carried their ideas into practice.

      Mr. Parkes's inventions consisted in combining manganese with copper,
 and using this alloy instead of ordinary copper with zinc, to form im-
 proved alloys of brass, yellow metal, &c., of which to make sheathing, rods,
 wire, nails, tubes, &c. Mr. Everitt, of Birmingham, has also lately
                                                                                                                                             ;

                           ON MANGANESE BRONZE.                                                                                              379

brought forward an alloy made in a similar manner. No comparative

·experiments as to the strength, hardness, or ductility, or other qualities

myof these alloys, have come under                                                   notice                               but I believe the  only effect
                                                                                                                       ;

of the manganese alone that I can discover is to add somewhat to the

toughness and ductility of the alloys, and allow copper and zinc of a

somewhat inferior quality to be used in the manufacture of brass and

other similar alloys, which, without the manganese, would not stand the

working necessary to shape them into the various articles for which they

were destined.

Mr. Morries Stirling, in 1848, however, proposed to use manganese in

various brass alloys in which irou was present, but in a very diffei'ent

manner from that employed by me. Mr. Stirling first combined about

7 per cent, or less of iron, with the zinc, and added to the copper a small

percentage of manganese by reducing the black oxide of manganese with

the copper, in the presence of carbonaceous materials, and then added

to it the requisite quantity of the iron and zinc alloy to make the improved

brass required. Mr. Stirling described a method of combining the iron

with the zinc by fusion, but in practice he found a more ready means of

procuring the zinc and iron alloy by employing the deposit found at the

bottom of the tanks used for containing the melted zinc for galvanising

iron articles ; this product consists of zinc with from 4 to 6 per cent,
of iron, bat this percentage is very variable, and this material is useless

if the amount of iron is required to be adjusted with accuracy. Another

great drawback to this class of alloy is the great difficulty of producing

sound castings of them in sand moulds with any certainty.

    These, then, were the chief inventions that have come under my

notice at all approaching mine in character, or similarity, at the time I

introduced it, Avhich invention I now proceed to describe.

The manganese bronze is prepared by introducing and mixing with

the copper, to be afterwards made into alloys similar to gun-metal,

bronze, brass, or any other alloy, of which copper forms the base, a small

proportion of ferro-manganese. The ferro-manganese is melted in a

sejiarate crucible, and is added to the copper when in a melted state, and

at a sufficiently high temperature.

The effect of this combination is similar to that produced by the addi-

tion of ferro-manganese to the decarburised iron in a Bessemer converter

the manganese in a metallic state, having a great affinity for oxygen,

cleanses the copper of any oxides it may contain, by combining with

them and rising to the surface in the form of slag, which renders the

Ametal dense and homogeneous.        portion of the naanganese is utilised

in this manner, and the reraainder, with the iron, becomes permanently
combined with the copper, and plays an important part in improving and
modifying the quality of the bronze and brass alloys, afterwards prepared

fr-om the copper thus treated ; the effect being greatly to increase their

strength,  hardness,  and  toughness                                                 the  degrees                         of  all  of  which can be
                                                                                  ;

modified at will, according to the quantity of the ferro-manganese used,

and the proportions of the iron and manganese it contains. By these

variations, together with variations in the proportions of copper, tin, and

zinc employed, a most valuable group of new alloys has been produced,
possessing qualities in the way of strength, hardness, toughness, &c., far
beyond anything yet obtained in any similar alloys.

It will be seen that the process described of making the manganese

bronze is altogether different, both in principle and effect, from Stirling's
                      --

--380 REPORT 1883.

or Parkes' inventions. Bj Stirling's method, combining the iron with

the zinc, in order to introduce it into the alloys, altogether precludes its-

use in any but those alloys in which a considerable portion of zinc is

employed, such as brass or yellow metal. It could not be applied to any

of those important alloys, of the nature of gun-metal or bronze, in which

copper and tin are the chief ingi'edients, and which form some of the

most valuable qualities of the manganese bronze but an equally impor-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

tant difference in the manufacture of manganese bronze consists in adding

the manganese in its metallic state, in the form of ferro-manganese, to

the copper, by which the copper is cleansed from oxides as before
explained, which cannot be the case when the manganese is reduced irora

the black oxide and combined with the copper, by one and the same

operation, in the manner pursued by Parkes and Stirling.

Another point of great importance is the very great nicety with which

both the iron and manganese can be adjusted, and the effect controlled

by adding the ferro-manganese to the copper, as pursued in the manu-

facture of manganese bronze. The amount of manganese required for

de-oxidising the copper and for permanent combination with it, having

been ascertained by experience, it is found that very slight variations in

quantity have a perceptible and ascertained effect in modifying the quali-

ties of the alloys produced                                                                                                                     that is to say, the toughness  can  be increased
                                                                                                                                             ;

and the hardness diminished, or vice versa, at will, precisely as is done in

the manufacture of steel, by increasing or diminishing the dose of carbon

and manganese.

In preparing the ferro-manganese for use, that which is rich in manga-

nese, containing say from 50 to 60 per cent., is preferred ; this is melted
with a certain proportion of the best wrought-iron scrap, so as to bring^

down the manganese to the various proportions required. At the same

time any silicon it contains is reduced and the metal refined. About four
qualities are made in practice, containing from about 10 to 40 per cent,

of metallic manganese. The lower qualities are used for those copper

alloys in which the zinc exceeds the tin, and the higher qualities in which

tin is used alone, or exceeds the zinc used in combination ; and th&
amount of ferro-manganese added varies generally from about 2 to 4 per

cent.

     After a number of experiments and tests,- the Manganese Bronze and
Brass Company, who are the sole manufacturers, have adopted the manu-

facture of five different qualities of manganese bronze, although other

varieties can be produced for special purposes. The distinctive features,

peculiarities, and purposes for which these qualities are suited are as

follows :

No. 1. In this quality the zinc alloyed with the copper is considerably

in excess of the tin. It is cast into ingots in metal moulds, and then

forged, rolled, or worked hot, and made into rods, plates, sheets, sheath-

ing                   and  it  may  also  be worked                                                                                             cold, and  drawn  into         tubes,  wire,  &c.
                   ;

When simply cast, it has a tensile strength of about twenty-four tons per

square inch, with an elastic limit of from fourteen to fifteen tons. When

rolled into rods or plates, it has a tensile strength of from twenty-eight

to thirty-two tons, with an elastic limit of twelve to twenty-three tons

per square inch, and it stretches from 20 to 45 per cent, of its length

Whenbefore breaking.                      cold rolled, the elastic limit rises to over thirty

tons, and the breaking strength to about forty tons, and it still elongates

about 12 per cent, before breaking.

     No. 2 is similar to No. 1, but still stronger, and it can with the
required care be cast in sand, when it is required to produce castings
for special purposes, possessing the greatest strength, hardness, and
toughness, but it must be melted in crucibles passing it through the

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

reverberatory furnace injures the metal, and causes unsound castings. It
is not, therefore, adapted for general brassfounders' purposes, and thos&

only who understand its peculiarities and are experienced in its use
should attempt casting it in sand. One of the most important applications

of this quality is that of producing articles cast in metal moulds under
pressure. Blocks of this metal thus simply cast have all the characteristics
of forged steel, as regards strength, toughness, and hardness, without any
of its defects. It is perfectly homogeneous, and, while not possessing a
fibrous texture, derived from rolling or hammering, it is still fibrous in
character, and this in not one but in all directions alike, and when broken
shows a silky fracture. Its tensile strength is from thirty to thirty-five
tons per square inch, its elastic limit from sixteen to twenty-two tons, with
an ultimate elongation of from 12 to 22 per cent. It can be cast on to
any object, and will shrink on to it with a force equal to its elastic limit,
and when released will show an amount of resilience about double that
of steel. Thus a hoop shrunk on to a solid cylinder of iron gave the fol-

--lowing results : It stretched when hot '03 of its diameter in the process

of contraction, and when cold and relaxed sprang back about "003 of its
diameter. As regards hardness, it is about equal to mild steel. To
compare it with gun-metal, wrought iron, and steel in this respect, the
following tests were made, by forcing a knife-edged angular die into the
flat surfaces of each of these metals. To make a dent of equal length,

the following pressures were recorded :

care having to be taken beyond wbat is ordinai'ily given in casting gun-

metal.

     It also possesses this very important advantage in the production

of large castings, that it may be melted in an ordinary reverberatory

furnace without injury to the metal ; very careful analysis of this alloy

· before and after passing through the reverberatory furnace showing that

Athere is no appreciable alteration in its constituents.  bar of this

metal cast in sand in the ordinary way, 1 inch square, placed on sup-

ports 12 inches apart, requii'es upwards of 4,200 pounds to break it ; and

before breaking it will bend to about a right angle, and it will sustain

from 1,700 to 1,800 lbs. before taking a permanent set. These results

are in every respect fully up to those of the best rolled wrought iron, as

some test bars of both, exhibited, will show : we have therefore in this a

material which can be cast with facility into any intricate form, which it

would not be possible to forge in iron, yet possessing all its strength,
toughness, and hardness. This quality of manganese bronze is used for a

variety of purposes, including spur bevel, and all kinds of toothed wheels,

gearing, worms and worm wheels, framing, brackets, and aU kinds of

supports, and connections of machines, crank-pin brasses, the shells of
main and other bearings of marine and other engines, axle-boxes and
other parts of locomotive engines ; and it has been found admirably

adapted for statuary and art purposes generally, being much admired for

its fine colour ; but the latter quality is quite a matter of taste, and the
members of the Association will be able to form their opinion thereon
by examining the beautiful clock and ornaments, kindly lent by Messrs.

Elkington & Co., made of the manganese bronze. The metal also seems

to be peculiarly adapted for large bells. The advantages in this latter
application are that bells cast from it possess the same, or greater, sono-
rousness with a more mellow tone, and are at the same time so tough
that they cannot by any means be cracked, like bells made of ordinary
bell-metal, which is obliged to be made brittle in order to acquire the
requisite sonorousness. The sound of a bell is also, to some extent, a
matter of taste, and those who take an interest in this question may form
an opinion as to the suitableness of the manganese bronze for this pur-
pose by sounding the one exhibited. But the most important application,

in a commercial point of view, is undoubtedly to that of steamship pro-

pellers, to which it has been largely applied.
     Owing to the great strength of this metal, and its non-liability to

corrosion, propellers of it can be made thinner than even those of steel,
the surface is beautifully smooth, and when cast they are theoretically

true to form, as, not having to pass through the annealing furnace, they
do not become distorted, as is generally the case with steel. For these
reasons the manganese bronze has a great advantage over steel. It has
been proved conclusively by the logs of a number of steamships that have
had their steel propellers replaced by manganese bronze blades that their
speed has been increased, and the consumption of coal diminished, while
the weight, vibration, and strain on the ship and machinery is consider-
ably reduced. In addition to this, all these advantages are secured at a
considerably less ultimate cost, taking it upon the average life of a vessel
for although the first cost of a manganese bronze propeller, or a propeller

with manganese bronze blades, is about double that of steel, it is inde-

structible, whereas at the end of about every three years the steel blades
become so pitted and corroded that their renewal is indispensable, which
ON MANGANESE BRONZE.  383

brings up the total cost of the steel blades, on an average, to two or three
times that of the manganese bronze.

     That the manganese bronze propellers are incorrodible, and in every

other respect efficient, has now been proved by experience, as some have
been at work approaching three years, and are as perfect in every respect
as when first ap}3lied. Some time after the introduction of the No. 3

quality for propellers, the No. 2 was employed for some propeller blades,
as fears were entertained as to the No. 3 setting up galvanic action and
corroding the stern frames. Most of these propellers stood well, but
some of the blades failed, and it was found on examination that the
castings were unsound, owing to the metal having become deteriorated

by melting in a reverberatory furnace. In consequence, it has now been

determined to adhere solely to the No. 3, as this quality has always

given the gi-eatest satisfaction, both as to its facility in casting and
efficiency under trial ; and further experience proves the supposed

galvanic action to be only a myth, or if there should be a tendency to it,

it is effectually prevented by lining the inside of the stern frame with

zinc strips.

   A proof of the soundness and tenacity of the manganese bronze was

shown in an accident, which occurred to one of the blades of the ' Garth

Castle,' at its launch from the yard of Messrs. John Elder & Co., in 1880,

when one of the blades came in contact with the jetty, and was bent
round, without even a crack, to nearly a right angle, and was afterwards
hammered back cold to its original form without detriment. The photo-
graph exhibited shows the blade from two points of view bent, and the
other view as hammered back ; another photograph shows one of the
blades of the Nox'th German Lloyd's steamship ' Mosel ' (kindly lent by

Messrs. John Elder & Co.), recovered from the ship after she was

wrecked, in which the metal was subjected to a still more severe punish-
ment without breaking than even in the case of the ' Garth Castle.'

     The other qualities, Nos. 4 and 5 of the manganese bronze, have no
particular claims to strength, but are most effective for the purpose of
bearings, slide valves, slide blocks, piston rings, &c., and in all situations
where friction occurs, and are much more durable than ordinary gun-metal.

     Before concluding I may add a few words on the art of brassfounding

generally, and I cannot help saying that, as at present practised, it

appears to me to be very far behind what might be expected in these

days of progress.

     In the maniifacture of iron and steel an amount of scientific know-
ledge has been brought to bear which elevates these industries into

scientific processes, but I can discover nothing of the kind in bronze and
brassfounding as ordinarily practised ; everything is done by the rule of
thumb, and that in a most clumsy manner. The idea of combining the
various metals to form the alloys required in atomic proportions does
not seem to have been ever entertained, and even the books written for
the practical guidance of brassfounders, ignore this important principle

altogether.

     I must not be understood as applying this remark to Dr. Percy and
Mr. Mallet, and other scientific metallurgists who have drawn attention
to the subject, and made valuable suggestions respecting it in their well-
known works ; but I allude to that class of books generally termed hand-
books, and the like, which contain instructions of the most clumsy and
unscientific character for making different alloys. Thus for gun-metal.

the proportions given are 1 lb. of copper to 2 oz. of tin, or if required to

be harder,  2^ oz.  or 2^ oz., and so  on                 then  as  regai'ds  brass, it                                         may be
                                                       ;

70 lbs. of copper and 30 lbs. of zinc, or 60 lbs. of copper and 30 lbs. of

zinc, or GO lbs. of copper and 40 lbs. of zinc for yellow metal, and so on.

Now, not one of these alloys or others described are in atomic pro-

portions, and that is the reason why unsatisfactory results are constantly

occurring in ordinary brassfounding ; not only are the copper alloys

thus produced weak, soft, spongy, and porous, but it is a constant occur-

rence that the constituents vary in different parts of the casting ; this

is the case principally in the gun metal and bronze alloys, the surplus

tin above that forming a definite alloy in atomic proportions seems to be

held in mechanical suspension, separates by liquation, and collects at the

top of the casting as it cools and solidifies, causing the well-known tin

spots, sponginess, &c.

     The only remedy the ordinary brassfounder has for this is to use as
large a proportion of scrap-metal as he can get ; he does not know why,
he only knows that he gets better castings by using it ; but the true

reason is that the scrap-metal has adjusted its constituents in atomic

proportions during the several remeltings it has undergone, the sui-plus

tin or zinc having  been got rid of by liquation                    and  oxidation                                              but  if in
                                                                                                                             ;

the original manufacture of the alloy the metals are combined in atomic

proportion, nothing of this kind happens, the castings are sound, and the

alloys homogeneous and stable.

In the manufacture of manganese bronze this principle is always kept

in view, and all the different qualities produced have the metal they are

composed of combined in atomic proportions. Whether by this any

chemical combination is efiFected, it is difficult to say ; but this much

I can vouch for, that the alloys thus produced are finer in texture, more
homogeneous, stronger, and of a very much more stable character than

when not so combined ; thus, in the No. 3 quality the addition of ^ per
cent, of tin, instead of making it harder and stronger, as it ought to be

according to the ordinary accepted ideas, actually makes it softer and

weaker and the grain coarser, and the same thing occurs if the additional

tin is increased ^r or 1 per cent., until the tin arrives at another definite

atomic proportion, when an alloy of a different character appears, but it

then becomes again close-grained, sound, homogeneous, and stable.
     As a further proof of the soundness of this theory, the No. 3 quality

may be passed through an ordinary reverberatory furnace, and although

in being thus treated it is exposed for a considerable time to the action
of an oxidising flame, no appreciable diminution of the tin in its compo-

sition has been detected. Then again, both the No. 1 and No. 2 may be

remelted several times in the crucible, if it is done with care, without any

alteration of its components.

     It is well known how difficult it is to melt brass and yellow metal,
even in a crucible, when every precaution is taken, without some of the

zinc escaping in fumes. This also, to a certain extent, occui's in melting
the No. 1 and No. 2 manganese bronze ; but the zinc apparently carries
its atomic complement of copper with it, so that the proportions of what

remains are not disturbed. I am led to this belief not only by examining

the metals after remelting, but by the colour of the condensed fumes,
which, instead of being white, as they are when produced from zinc alone,
have a beautiful pink colour, which I can only attribute to the presence

of copper.

     Another, and perhaps still more palpable proof of the value of com-
bining the metals in their atomic proportions is that, when this is done,

the specific gravity of these alloys is perceptibly increased over those not so
combined, even though in the latter case the heavier metal be in excess.

    I was much struck by this fact in taking the specific gravity of some
No. 1 manganese bronze, Avhich contains a considerable amount of zinc, and

which, jxidging by its constituents, ought to be a comparatively light metal
but the trial proved that it was about equal to that of ordinary gun-metal,
composed of copper and tin, and very considerably above the mean weight

of the metals composing it, indicating to my mind that these metals must

have combined in such a manner as each to fit into, and more nearly fill
up, the infinitesimal spaces between the atoms of the other, and if not
actually forming what chemists would admit to be a perfect chemical
combination, certainly more nearly approaching it than when the metals
are mixed together in the haphazard manner usually prevailing.

     I have no doubt that these combinations and the stable quality of the
manganese bronze alloys is due also very materially to the action of the
metallic manganese on the copper, by freeing it from the oxides it contains
and bringing the metals added to it into actual contact, and thus enabling
them to combine in a more perfect manner than has been accomplished

hitherto. I have only now to refer to the list of tests appended, which it

would be tedious to recite ; but they can be referred to, and the results

will be found attached to the samples, as also a description of the other

articles exhibited.

by Professor Osborne Reynolds in teacbing his class. "We have here a

central roller A, pressed on by three intermediate rollers B, B2 B3, which

are all held in what I have called a nest ring D pi-essing the whole together.

The pressure is caused and maintained by coning the rollers as shown

in section. When the two halves of pulleys B are pinched together,

they are wedged against d by A, and the necessary adhesion obtained,

allowing D to drive A or A to drive D.^ Mr. Foster has informed me

that he considered his invention to be this mode of tightening, for

that be had met with examples of similar nests in which an attempt

had been made to get the pressure simply by initial fitting. Mr. Foster's

mode of tightening is ingenious, and a modification of it will probably be

found very useful ; the surfaces of the rollers do not roll true on each

Vother, and although the friction from this cause is less than in the old

friction gear, it is considerably greater than we shall have in true rolling

nest gear. The possibility of tightening by cones and by double-cones

occurred to me independently ; and at about the same time Mr.

Williamson, a draughtsman then employed by Messrs. Ayrton and Perry,

conceived the idea of a nest which was almost identical with Mr. Foster's,

My myown favourite idea when I took out  first provisional specification

in the spring of this year was to tighten the rollers by the means shown

in fig. 4. A is placed excentrically to D ; there are three rollers, B, B.2 B3, of

which Bi is smaller than the two others ; all the rollers have simple cylin-

drical surfaces which would develop as planes ; the tightening is effected

by forcing one of the rollers, as B2, from a wider into a narrower part of

the space between A and D. When the excentricity is not great a very

moderate force on the spindle of the tightening roller will maintain a great

pressure between the rollers. Mechwart, I have since found, employs

a similar adjustment to vary the space between his laminating rollers,

but, as T have already pointed out, he did not construct gear to be sub-

stituted for toothed wheels in any case, whereas the nests which I am de-

scribing are gear in the sense that they can be used instead of spur-wheels

and pinions. Nests tightened by this excentric method are exhibited at

Southport as part of a large winch made by Messrs. Stothert and Pitt.

It has also been employed in a telpherage locomotive designed in the

ofl&ce of the Telpherage Co., and made by Messrs. Crornpton. In both

cases the gear works extremely well, and the rolling friction has proved to

be smaller than I anticipated. I am not yet able to give accurate informa-

tion as to this friction, nor as to the wear, but I can say that the friction

is less than that of spur-wheels when these are transmitting considerable

force, although more than that of spur-wheels when these are running

quite slack. The efficiency of the winch Arhen lifting 1^ tons is about

80 per cent. It contains two large nests, or has, in other words, double

purchase, and the speed of the chain lifting the weight is about -j-g-oth the

speed of the handles. The design of the winch is in several respects

defective, the rollers Bi B2B3 are all overhung and imperfectly supported;

they do not therefore lie with the axes quite parallel. This leads to two bad

results. 1. There is a screwing action tending to move the rollers length-

ways against the collars or flanges by whicb they are retained. 2. It tends

to reduce the line of contact between the convex rollers to a point where

the cylinders cross, and at this point wear occurs. It will be quite easy

     ' Since realing this paper I have found a patent by Mr. Tibbitts containing the
same arrangements.

to remedy these defects in future designs. The pressure on the surfaces
is such as allows one inch of breadth to transmit about 200 lbs. of force,
but we do not yet know the wear under these conditions. The smallest

of the rollers is 3 ins. in diameter.

    I am now inclined to think that the excentric method of tightening

will prove less convenient than other plans, some of which will be
presently described. The framing and system of levers for the excentric
method are complex, and it is found necessary (in order to avoid useless
friction) to slack back the tightening screw a little after each fresh
adjustment of the tightening roller. This prevents the advantageous
use of a spring to take up the wear by constantly forcing the tightening
roller into the narrow part. I prefer the method of tightening in which
two external i^everse coned surfaces are pinched between two internal
coned surfaces, as in fig. 5, but when tightening is effected in this way the
surfaces of the two convex rollers, as at A and b, should be flat cylindrical

surfaces rolling true together.

     Messrs. Ayi'ton and Perry have constructed a nest (not exhibited
here) in which the pinching is effected by an ingenious arrangement of
the outer nest ring, and in this nest the ring itself is stationary, while
the nest of intermediate rollers, with their frame, revolves. These
experiments have in certain cases given an apparent efficiency of 97 per
cent, for this nest, multiplying the angular velocity nine times. The

grinding action due to the coned surfaces is very much less than in the

old forms of friction gear, and is indeed insignificant, as will be seen
from a simple calculation of the difference of velocities between the mean

circumference and the extreme on either side. When the breadth is

say ^ in., the taper 1 in 5, and the diameter of the two rollers in gear
say 18 ins. and 8 ins. respectively, the rubbing action of the two wheels
rolling together at the mean diameter will, at the extreme edge of the path,
be due to a gain or loss of -0625 in. in 18 ins., or about 0-348 per cent.
Whatever be the coefficient of friction, if the pressure were only just
sufficient to prevent gi-ipping, this would entail a loss of only 0'348 per
cent, in the power transmitted. It would actually be somewhat larger

than this, but still insignificant where the breadth of bearing is small
compared with the diameter, and where the intermediate rollers are
large. I myself prefer to get the pinching by causing one or more
intermediate rollers to expand lengthways. In that case only one inter-

mediate roller need grind or bear on the cones. The two others may run

on the flat surface between the cones.^
     In fig. 6 will be seen a modification which I believe to be wholly

novel. In this arrangement we have a multiplication in a duplex ratio.
The two parts D and Di of the nest ring may be joined or they m.ay be
wholly separate. The modes of tightening may be any of those described.
The gear so far described has been suited for joining shafts which have

their axes in one straight line, or in parallel lines which are not far apart.

I have called it concentric nest gear. I next pass to right-angled

nest gear, the first form of which was due to a suggestion of my son,

C. Frewen Jenkin. In its simplest form this gear is shown in fig. 7, where
the contact between the surfaces of d Di, the nest discs, with b and B, the
intermediate rollers, is confined to a single point. In this figure the

   ' Since reading this paper at Southport I have patented a plan in which, by inclining
the two sides of this expanding roller, all the coned surfaces run true on each other.
390 BEPORT-- 1883.

tigTitening is given by a spring acting on one disc, which slides on the

shaft d, being prevented from turning by a feather. This form is

employed for the gripping wheels of the telpherage locomotive made by

Messrs. Easton and Anderson, and may be seen in the exhibition driven

for a yard or two by an electric current. One development of right-

angle gear, due to Messrs. Ayrton and Perry, fig. 8, is employed in the

small telpherage locomotive designed by them, and now in the room.

Here the contact takes  place  along a line                                                       the  tightening is effected by
                                                                                               ;

wedging, and instead of two discs joined together by a spring, we have a

single wheel with a rim in which the cones run.

Figs. 9 and 10 show two further developments of right-angle nest

mygear contained in  first patent ; the action is obvious. In addition to

the forms of gear which have now been described, several applications

of the principle have been made to oblique gear, to gear between parallel

myshafts, and to gear with belting, but the time at                                                    disposal will hardly

allow my explaining them or the latest methods of tightening. I trust

to be able before the next meeting to publish results obtained from more

prolonged and exhaustive experiments on various forms of the gear.

         TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.

   Section A.--MATHEMATICAL AND PHYSICAL SCIENCE.

                      --President of the Section

  Professor Heneici, Th-D., F.R.S., President of the London Mathematical Society.

                          THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 20.

    The President delivered the following Address :

On reading through the addresses delivered by my predecessors in this office, I was

struck by the fact that in nearly every case the speaker began with a lamentation

over his imfitness for the work before him, and those seemed to me to be the more
eloquent on these points who showed by their address that they least needed an
excuse. The amount of excuse given appears in fact to be directly proportional

to the gifts of the speaker, and hence inversely proportional to the need of such
an excuse.

    Under these circumstances I cannot express my sense of my own unfitness for

this post better than by saying nothing about it. I must, however, beg your

indulgence for my shortcomings, both as regards my address and my manner of

conducting the general business of this section.

    As the Presidential chair is occupied by one of the most illustrious of mathe-
maticians, it would be presumptuous for me to attempt to give an account of the

recent progress of mathematics. I propose only to speak for a short time on that

--part of mathematics which has always been most attractive to myself that is, pure

geometry as apart from algebra, but I shall confine myself to some considerations

relating to the teaching of geometry in this country. Pure geometry seems to me
to be of the greatest educational value, and almost indispensable in many appli-

cations ; but it has scarcely ever been introduced at Cambridge, the centre of
mathematics and mathematical education in England.

    The number of geometrical methods now in use is astonishingly great. These

differ on the one hand according to the nature of the result aimed at, but on the
other according to the amount of algebra employed, and to the relation in which
this algebra stands to the pure ' Anschauunc/.'' I use the word Anschauung
because I know of no English equivalent ; the German word has the philosophic
meaning rendered by intuition, and retains its original concrete meaning of looking
at a thing, and might perhaps be translated : intuition by inspection. It is the
inspection of figures which is of the greatest importance in geometry. It is
hereby of little consequence whether the figures are seen by the physical eye or

only mentally ; because the conception of that space in which we perceive every-
thing and without which we can perceive nothing, which therefore is, according to
Kant, a form of our Anschauunr/, is built up in our mind through many genera-

tions in conformity with sensual impressions.
     It would be of interest, if time permitted, to follow up the gradual develop-

ment and extension of geometry into the wider science of algebra, from the first
introduction of the latter in the theory of proportion to the present state, where
there exists really no essential difference between the two, where geometry
is only one manifestation of algebra, but so complete a one, that at least within its
number of dimensions it again contains algebra.

     In some of the methods just referred to, no algebra is used at all, whilst others

may be distinguished according to the nature of the algebra used, whether
394 KBPOKT-- 1883.

equations containing 1, 2, 3, or more variables are employed. In such a division,
Von Staudt's system, without a vestige of algebra, would occupy the one end, and

the purely algebraical theory of invariants with geometrical interpretation the

other.

     There is, however, not only a difference in the amount of algebra used, but, if

possible, a greater one in the manner in which the symbols are interpreted. And

it is here that algebra has apparently the greater power. One algebraical theorem,

by being read in different ways, by giving ever different meanings to the symbols,

Wereveals a variety of geometrical and other theorems.  have in it the crystallised

form, the very essence of the mathematical truth, but in the most abstract form

conceivable. Now this most abstract form is the highest and the most perfect

which mathematical truth as such can assume, and which it must assume before a

theory is really complete in the eyes of a pure mathematician. It is only in this

shape that it is ready to be turned to account in any direction where it may be

needed.

     In thus placing algebra on the highest pinnacle, the reasons will be apparent

which wiU malie many mathematicians, not to mention others, prefer the truths it

reveals cast in a mould which connects them with concrete things rather than with

abstract notions. In fact, to be thoroughly at home in the highest theories of pure
algebra requires some of the genius of men like Cayley and Sylvester who have
founded, and to a great extent built up, modern algebra. But even they constantly
make use of geometry to assist them in their investigations, and no one could have

expressed this more strongly than Professor Sylvester himself in his brilliant

address delivered from this chair at the Exeter meeting of our Association.

     If this is so, surely every progress in the spread of the knowledge of pure
geometry should be welcomed and encouraged ; but in England pure geometry is
almost unknown excepting in the elements as contained in Euclid and in the old-

fashioned geometrical conies. The modern methods of syntbetic projective geo-

metry as developed on the Continent have never become generally known here.
The few men who have thoroughly made themselves acquainted with them, and
who have preferred purely geometrical reasoning, have not belonged to Cambridge,
and have thus stood somewhat outside the national system of training mathe-

matical teachers. The late Professor Smith introduced these methods at'O.xford,
and there was some expectation that he would have written, if he had been spared,
a text-book which might have done much to introduce the subject more widely.
His principal mathematical work lay, however, in another direction.

     The one English mathematician whose mathematical thought is purely geo-

metrical is Dr. Hirst, a pupil of Steiner, who in the position which he has just

relinqmshed has been able to introduce, as the first, modern geometrical metliods

into a regular system of professional education, whilst showing at the same time by
his original work what can be done vdth tliese methods.

  --Other mathematicians who have studied these methods and I believe there are
--many have made use of them by translating the geometrical into algebraical

reasoning.

Towards the early possibility of such a translation much was done by the

labours of the late Mr. Spottiswoode, who years ago wrote the first connected

treatise on the theorj^ of determinants, and who up to the last few years employed
some of his leisure hom-s in working out geometrical problems, the work consisting

always of some beautiful piece of algebra.

     It is not often that our section has to mourn in one year the loss of two such
men as Smith and Spottiswoode.

    It is easy to see how the neglect complained of has come to pass. In England
when mathematics, after having lain dormant for about a century, began to revive,

the first necessity was to become acquainted with the enormous amount of work

meanwhile done on the Continent. This acquaintance was made through France,

at that time nearly all the standard works being in the French language, which
was at the same time the language best known to English students. The subjects

principally taken up were the calculus and its application to mechanics. And I
believe I am not far wrong when I say that the wonderful writings of Lagrange
TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                395

with their extraordinary analytical elegance had the greatest influence. But in his
works anything geometrical was studiously avoided. Lagrange prided himself that

there was no figure in his ' Mecanique analytique.'
     The best analytical methods of the Continent were thus introduced into

England, rapidly assimilated and made the foundation of new theories, so that the
mathematical activity in this country is now at least as great as it ever has heen

anywhere.

    But whilst analysis, algehra, and with it analytical geometry, made rapid
progress, piu-e geometry was not equally fortunate. Here the hold which Euclid
had long obtained, strengthened, no doubt, by Newton's example, prevented any

change in the methods of teaching.

     Most of all, perhaps, solid geometry has suffered, because Euclid's treatment of

--it is scanty, and it seems almost incredible that a great part of it the mensuration
--of areas of simple curved surfaces and of volumes of simple solids is not included

in ordinary school teaching. The subject is, possibly, mentioned in arithmetic,
where, under the name of mensuration, a number of rules are given. But the
iustification of these rules is not supplied, except to the student who reaches the

application of the integral calculus ; and what is almost worse is that the general
mrelations of points, lines, and planes,
                                          space, is scarcely touched upon, instead

of being fully impressed on the student's mind.

    The methods for doing this have long been developed in the new geometry

which originated in France with Monge. But these have never been thoroughly

introduced.

    Works written in the German language naturally received even less attention.

But it was in Germany, at the begmning of the second quarter of this century,
that geometry received at the hands of several masters an impulse which put the

subject on an entirely new footing.

    I may mention here especially four men of whom each invented a new method
and established a new system of geometry. Two of these, MiJbius and Pliicker,

still use algebra, but in perfectly new and original manners, which, although very
different from each other, have this in common, that in both we liave not algebra
interpreted geometrically, but rather geometry veiled in an algebraic garb. The

geometrical meaning is never lost sight of.

     But perfectly independent of algebra was the great Steiuer, the greatest
geometrician since the times of Euclid, Appolouius, and Archimedes. In his
celebrated ' Systematische Entwickelungen ' he has laid the foundation of a pure
geometry, on" which a wonderful ediiice has since been raised. His treatment
of the principle of duaUty, and his methods of generating conies by p^ojecti^-e, or

homographic, rows and pencils which have been extended to curves of all degrees,

have given to geometrical reasoning a generality never before dreamed of. He is
in one respect the opposite of Lagrange, hating and despising analysis as much as

ever Lagi-ange disliked pure geometry. Steiner started from the geometry of the
Greeks, Euclid's elements, and a few other metrical properties he takes for granted ;

but then he goes on with essentially modern methods of his own to investigate

what are now called projective properties of curves and sm-faces.
     This metrical foundation Von Staudt changed. In his 'Geometric der Lage,'

published fifteen years after Steiner's 'Entwickelungen,' he established a most

remarkable and complete system, into which the notion of a magnitude does not

enter at all. He shows that projective properties of figures, which have no

relation whatsoever to measurements, can be established without any mention

of them. He goes so far as even to give a geometrical definition of a number, in

its relation to geometry as determining the position of a point, in his theory of what
he calls ' Wiiife ; and one of the most interesting parts of his work is the purely

geometrical treatment of imaginary points, lines, and planes.
      In the hands of these men, and since their time, pure geometry has become a

most important instrument for research, rivalling in power the more or less
algebraical methods, and surpassing them all in the manner in which they raise

before the mind's eye a clear realisation of the forms and figures which are the

object of the investigation.
396 REPORT-- 1883.

In close connection -with tliese methods stand descriptive geometry and

geometrical drawing, which teach how to represent figures on a plane or other

surface. These have been treated as arts unknown at English universities, and

relegated to the drawing office. Instead of this they ought to be an essential

and integral part of the teaching of geometry in connection with the purely

geometrical methods.

    As far as the progress of science is concerned, this neglect of pm'e geometry

--in England has been of little consequence perhaps it has rather been a gain. For
science itself it is often an advantage that a centre of learning becomes one-sided,

neglects many parts in order to concentrate all its energy on some particular points,
and make rapid progress in the directions in which these lie. At present, when

mathematics flourishes as never before, when almost every nation, however small,

has its eminent mathematician, there are so many such centres that what is neglected
at one place is pretty surely taken up and advanced at another. But what may

suffer, if one side of a science is not cultivated in a country, is the industry which
would have gained by its apphcations.

In considering the teaching of any mathematical or other scientific subject, we

cannot at the present time neglect the wants of the ever-increasing class of men
who require what has been called technical education. Among these, the large
number who want mathematics at all require geometry mucli more than algebra

and analysis, and geometry as applied to drawiug and mensuration.

This want has been supplied by the numerous science classes spread over the

country, with their head-quarters at the Science and Art Department at South

--Kensmgton, whose examinations now, however, put in competition with those of
--the City and Guilds of London Institute, and others have pretty much guided

Aand regulated the teaching.  great deal of good has thus been done, but there is

still much room for improvement. The teaching of geometry especially, as judged

by the text-books which have come before me, is somewhat deplorable. And this

is so, principally, because the spirit of Euclid and the methods of the ancient

Egyptians and Greeks, rather than the fimdamentally different ideas and methods

of modern geometry, still rule supreme ; though the latter have had their origin

partly in technical wants.

     In what is called Geometrical Drawing, or Practical Geometry, for instance,

--there are first given a number of elementary constructions such as drawing parallels

and perpendiculars, or bisecting the distauce between two given points. They are

--solved by aid of those instruments only which Euclid knew viz. the pair of com-

passes for drawing circles, and the straight-edge for drawing straight lines. But

there is no draughtsman who would not, as a matter of course, use set squares for

the former problem, and solve the latter by trial rather than by construction. Then

again there come constructions like the division of the circumference of a circle into

seven parts, which cannot be solved accurately, but which is very easily solved by

trial. Instead of that, a construction is given which takes much more time, and is

bv no means more accurate. For, after all, our lines drawn on the paper are not

without thickness, so that, for this reason alone, every part of the construction is

affected by some small error ; and it is absurd to employ a construction, though

theoretically true for ideal figures as conceived in our mind, in preference to a much

sunpler one which, within our practical limits, is equally, or perhaps more,

correct.

This is very much like the manner in which I found problems on decimal fractions

treated by the candidates for the Matriculation Examination at the London Uni-

mversity, and which reflected little credit on the manner which the important subject

of decimals is handled at our schools. It is so characteristic that I may be excused

for giving it here. The problem, for instance, being to give the product of two

decimal fractions, exact to, say, four decimals, each of the factors having the same

number of places. This was almost regularly performed as follows. First, the

decimals are converted into vulgar fractions, then these are duly multiplied, nume-

rator by numerator, and denominator by denominator, and then the resulting fraction

is again converted to a decimal, with as many places as it may yield, and, lastly, of

these the first four are taken and put down, duly marked Ansiver. Or a candidate,
                            !

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.     397

standing however on a far higher level, multiplies hoth decimals out in the proper

fashion, but to eight places, and cuts off four places at the end. No wonder that

the public at large will hear nothing of the decimal system of weights and measures

if the very essence of the decimal system of numbers is so little understood by the
men who have to train the minds of the young generation

     I need scarcely say that I do not mean to blame the Science and Art Department,
far less the teachers who have simply to follow suit. They act up to their light,

and cannot be expected to introduce methods which are practically unknown at
Cambridge, and of which the only good text-books are in foreign languages ; books

which are probably not at all suitable for introduction into our schools without

considerable change.

     It is satisfactory to learn that an association has recently been formed under
the presidency of Professor Huxley ' to effect the general advancement of the
profession of science and art teaching by securing improvements in the schemes of

study, and the establishment of satisfactory relations between teachers and the
Science and Art Department, the City and Guilds of London Institute, and other

public authorities.'

    The good wishes of all who have the cause of sound education at heart must go

with such an undertaking, one of the principal aims of which seems to be to save
teaching from being any longer enslaved by examinations, and to promote greater
accord between the teacher and the examiner. It is to be hoped that this associa-

tion will consider geometry as one of the subjects included under the designation of

science.

     It is by the neglect of pure geometiy and its applications to geometrical
drawing that Cambridge has lost, or rather has never had, contact with the
practical needs of the nation. All the marvels of modern engineering have sprung
into existence without its help. The great engineers have had to depend to a

degree, now unheard of, upon costly experiments, until they themselves gradually

discovered mathematical methods adapted to their purposes.

     Only the electrical engineer found ready to his hands a complete theorv of

which the mathematical part has been to a very great extent developed at Cam-
bridge, or by men who have had their mathematical training there. This theory
is, however, in its very nature less geometrical. One at least of the great men

to whom the present theory of electricity is due, the late Clerk Maxwell, had the

keenest appreciation of the value of modern geometry. I remember a characteristic
letter of his being read to the Council of the London Mathematical Society, in which
the writer, forgetting the subject of his letter, burst out into an enthusiastic praise
of a German text-book, the ' Geometrie der Lage,' by Reye, through which Maxwell
evidently, for the first time, got any idea of this subject.

     The engineer will always prefer geometrical methods to analysis, and has

invented for himself a great vaiiety of them. Originally these are disjointed

being invented for special purposes. It is the business of the mathematician after-
wards to connect, simplify, and extend them, as has been done to a great extent

by Culmann in Ziirich, or by Cremona at the Polytechnic School at Home.
    Of these methods a few may be mentioned. First of all the geographical

determination of stresses in certain girders invented both by mathematicians and
by engineers. Its application is so simple that no engineer will ever use any other
method if once he knows this one. It is so well adapted to its purpose, that I

venture to say that a simpler method is impossible, being fully aware how

dangerous such a statement is. Nay, if I were asked to give the formulee to

obtain the stresses by calculation, I should write these down from a sketch of the
diagi-am, this being the simplest way of obtaining them.

     Another problem which recurs again and again is the determination of the
area of a figure representing perhaps a plot of land or the section of a beam.
Here also the advantage is altogether on the side of the graphical method.

     It is unnecessary to multiply these examples. But to make full use of graphical
methods the draughtsman ought to have a thoroughly geometrical education. For
instance, the real nature of the reciprocal diagrams already mentioned is only
understood by aid of a peculiar reciprocal relation between points and planes in
--398 REPORT 1883.

space closely connected with tlie theory of the linear complex, as has been shown by

Cremona.
     I have mentioned already the ' Analytical Mechanics ' of Lagrange, which is

without any trace of geometry, although there is scarcely a branch of applied
mathematics which is in its very nature more geometrical. In fact one part of it,

now separated as kinematics, treats solely of changes in position aud shape of

geometrical quantities, and differs from pure geometry only in this, that the

changes are considered as referring not to space alone, but also to time.

    What mechanics gains by introducing geometry to the full will be apparent
to all who have become acquainted with modern Continental text-books on the

subject.

      Let us compare the analytical with the geometrical reduction of a system of
forces acting on a rigid body, or, to use Cliflbrd's nomenclature, the reduction of a

system of rotors, which may represent either forces or rotations, or any other
quantities which have certain fundamental properties in common with those, so
that they may be represented by rotors. In the analytical process the system is

reduced to a rotor and a vector, that is a resultant force and a couple. In the

geometrical treatment we see that this is only one way of reducing the rotors to

two, viz. the one which is best fitted to be treated by analysis. But there is a
multitude of other reductions. These all appear as of equal importance in the
geometrical method. Furthermore, this method shows us in the simplest way
possible how all the hne pairs wliich may be the lines of action of two residtant
rotors, although there are infinities of infinities of such pairs, are ananged in space,

so that one gets a clear picture of all these reductions in one's mind.

     Again, compare Mobius' geometrical investigation of the rays of light passing
through a system of lenses with that of Gauss, whose very name suggests simplicity
and elegance. The celebrated ' cardinal points ' appear in Gauss' original paper as
the result of a somewhat long though certainly elegant analysis, whilst by Mobius
they are the natural outcome of his geometry, so that any student once started
on this method is bound to come across these points, or rather across pairs of
points, of which the cardinal points of Gauss are only one special case. The whole

is, in fact, contamed in the following easily proved proposition : the rays of hght start-
ing from a point in the axis of the system before entering the first lens, and after

leaving the last, form two homographic pencils in perspective position.
     This is only one small part of the advantage wliich optics can derive from

geometry.

     That the old-established mode of teaching the elements of geometry based on

Euclid requires a thorough and fundamental change has been often aclaiowledged,

among others, at Exeter and Bradford, by two of the most eminent mathematicians
who have occupied this chair, and besides by the many teachers who constitute the
Association for the Improvement of Geometrical Teaching, which itself grew out
of the action of our section. I know therefore of no opportimity better suited to

review the progress made in this direction than the present one, as the subject has
on several occasions occupied the attention of our section. Nevertheless I have

hesitated at entering on this somewliat delicate question, because I fear that I have
little to ofl'er but criticism, which might seem hostile to the Association just named.

But I hope that the many earnest workers, who have devoted much time and

thought to the drawing up of syllabuses on different parts of our subject, will excuse

the remarks of one who has himself tried his hand at the same work, and who
therefore may be supposed somewhat to know the difficulties that have to be

overcome.

When the syllabus on the elements of plane geometry appeared, I resolved to
"·ive it a thorough trial, and took the best means in my power to form an opinion

myon its merits, by introducing it into one of  classes. The fact that it did not

quite satisfy me, and that I gave up its use again, does not, of course, prove that it

fails also for use in schools, for which it was originally intended.

    Let me add that the more I have become acquainted with the difficulty of the

whole subject, the greater has become my admiration for Euclid's book, whilst my

conviction of its unfitness as a school book has equally gained in strength.

     In considering tlie merits of Euclid as a text-book, it is desirable to distinguish

clearly between the general educational value of its teaching and the gain of geo-

metrical knowledge. It is with the latter chiefly that I am concerned, whilst it

is, of course, through the former that Euchd has got so firm a hold at all schools

and to the great majority of boys this is undoubtedly of most importance, and no
reform would have the slightest chance of becoming generally introduced which

neglects this. But improvement in both directions may well go together, and the
logical reasoning employed in Euclid would gain to many boys much, both in

clearness and interest, if the subject-matter reasoned about became in itself better

understood.

     Probably a great deal could be done by introducing some of the elements of

--logic into the teaching of language. I have been assured by an eminent scholar

that the laws of forming a sentence the fact that a sentence in its simplest form
consists of subject, object and copula, was not explained in English schools. If this
grammatical part of logic were properly treated of in connection with language,
and if at the same time acquaintance with geometrical objects, particularly through

the medium of geometrical drawing and the many methods used in the Kinder-
gartens, were more secured, then a .systematic course of geometry would become

both easier and more useful.

    Much indeed may be done b)^ introducing simple geometrical teaching into the

nursery, and into the earliest instruction of childi-en, following the example of the

Kindergarten, and it is pleasing to see that the latter are rapidly gaining ground

in England. It is true that these schools may still be improved. In geometry

they seem to, and perhaps at present are bound to, work mostly towards Euclid.
But many able men and women are actively engaged in perfectmg them, and it is
of interest to know that Clifford had it in his mind to write a geometry for the

nursery and the Kindergarten.

In a cm-ioua contrast to the mode of teaching geometry stands that of teaching-

algebra. In the first everything is sacrificed to logic. Axioms and definitions

without end are given, though to the beginner a more rapid dive into the subject

would be much more suitable. In algebra, on the other hand, the boy is at once
Aplunged into the midst of it. No axiom is mentioned.
                                                       number of rules are

stated, and the schoolboy is made to practise them mechanically until he can per-

form, and that often with considerable skill, a nimiber of most complicated calcu-

--lations but calculations which are often of very little use for actual application.

Simplifications of equations foUow in senseless monotony, until the poor fellow

really thinks that solving a simple equation does not mean the finding of a certain

number which satisfies the equation, but the going mechanically through a certain
regular process which at the end yields some number. The connection of that
number with the original equation remains to his mind somewhat doubtful. Then

there are processes, like the finding of the G. C. M., which most of the boys never

Ahave any opportunity of using, excepting, perhaps, in the examination room.

more rational treatment of the subject, introducing from the beginning reasoning

rather than calculation, and applying the results obtained to various problems
taken from all parts of science as well as from everyday life, would be more
interesting to the stvident, give him really useful knowledge, and would be at the

same time of true educational value.

The chief progi-ess in geometrical teaching has to he sought in the introduction

of modern ideas and methods into the very elements, and modern teaching ought

to take full account of this.

    In favour of this view I might bring forward the opinions of many teachers

and mathematicians from England, as well as from abroad, but I will confine

myself to one quotation. Professor Sylvester gives his opinion thus : ' I should
rejoice to see mathematics taught with that life and animation which the presence
and example of her young and buoyant sister (viz., natural and experimental

science) could not fail to impart, short roads preferred to long ones, Euclid

honourably shelved or buried "deeper than did ever plummet sound" out of the
schoolboy's reach, morphology introduced into the elements of algebra projec-

-- --tion, correlation, motion accepted as aids to geometry the mind of the student

quickened and elevated and his faith awakened by early initiation into the ruling

ideas of polarity, continuity, infinity, and familiarisation with the doctrine of the

ima^nary and inconceivable. It is this living interest in the subject which is so

wanting in our traditional and mediaeval modes of teaching.'

    If from this point of view we now look towards the work of the Association

for the Improvement of Geometrical Teaching, the result is not so satisfactory as

might have been wished. There is very little of the influence of modern ideas to

be found in the different syllabuses which have been published. Even in the one

headed ' Modern Geometry ' there is nothing of the genius of modern thought.

The subject-matter is partly taken from modern geometry, but for modern methods

one looks in vain. In the geometrical conies, too, one would like to see Steiner's

generation of conies, but of these there is no trace.

Nevertheless, it is satisfactory to see that the use of the syllabus on plane

geometry has spread pretty widely, and it is to be hoped that it will continue to do

Aso. thorough reform, in the direction indicated, will be a difficult task, and it

will perhaps be a long time before it is possible. At present it has not even

been settled which series of axioms will ultimately be adopted. Of the

various systems which have been proposed since the investigations of Riemann

and Ilelmholtz, I may mention here Clifford's suggestion to replace Euclid's axiom

about parallels by the new one, which maintains that in a plane similar figures

exist, or, more completely, that at any part in a plane a figure is possible which is

similar to any given iigure in that plane. This axiom is somewhat startling as

long as we ha-\e the usual theory of similar figures in our mind. But the notion

myof similar figures is truly axiomatic, and it has lately become  conviction that

this axiom may be extremely fruitful, and the working out of a syllabus of plane

geometry based on it would be very desirable.

Possibly many such attempts have still to be made before a new Euclid finds

the materials sufiiciently prepared for him to raise the hoped-for edifice, j

    6. Experiments in Bolometnj. By Professor Silvanus P. Thompson.

     Hitherto the bolometers devised by Langley and others have been constructed
of tliin metal tilms blackened with lamp-black or platinum-black. Abstract con-
siderations show, however, that to have a maximimi degree of sensitiveness the
conductor emploj^ed should be one in which the change of electric resistance per
degree of temperature is the greatest ; it should also have as small a thermal
capacity as possible, and its exposed surface should be its only conducting part.
Theoretically, therefore, a carbon-film in some high-conducting form should be the
best. Pending the preparation of special carbon-films the author had made some
experiments on the strips and filaments of carbon which are to be found in incan-
descent lamps. The resistance of these, when carefidly measured on a Kirchhoff^s
bridge, was found to be considerably less when exposed to radiation than when
kept in the dark, the change of resistance in some cases amounting to 3 per cent,
of the total resistance. The cylindrical filaments and rectangular strips used in
most lamps are not, however, well adapted to show tlie bolometric eflect, as their
exposed surface is small as compared with the area of the cross-section of the

conductor.

    These observations suggest the following points :--
     (1) That measurements made for specifying the resistances of such lamps

should be conducted in the dark.

    (2) That a carbon-film, or even a carbon-lamp, may serve as the receiving part

of a photophone.

     (3) That probably the effects obtained by Dr. Bornstein with metals might be
re-observed if the metal films were very thin.

     (4) That special films of good-conducting carbon should be applied in standard

bolometers.

     (5) That a true standard photometer might be constructed on the bolometric
principle, having the sensitive conducting film covered with pigmentum nigrum

from the human eye. Such an instrument ought to be sensitive to precisely the

same rays as the eye itself, and in identically relative proportions for different

rays.

       8. Suggestions for facilitating the use of a delicate Balance.

                   By Professor Lord Rayleigh, F.E.S.

In some experiments with which I have lately been occupied a coil of insulated

wire, traversed by an electric current, was suspended in the balance, and it was a

matter of necessity to be able quickly to check the oscillation of the beam, so as to

Abring the coil into a standard position corresponding to the zero of the pointer.

very simple addition to the apparatus allowed this to be done. The current from

a Leclanch^ cell is led into an auxiliary coil of wire, coaxal with the other, and is

controlled by a key. When the contact is made, a vertical force acts upon the

suspended coil, but ceases as soon as the contact is broken. After a little practice

the beam may be brought to rest at zero at the first or second application of the

retarding force.

      This control over the oscillations has been found so convenient that I have

applied a similar contrivance in the case of ordinary weighings, and my object in

the present note is to induce chemists and others experienced in such operations

to give it a trial. Two magnets of steel wire, three or four inches long, are

attached vertically to the scale-pans, and underneath one of them is fixed a coil of

insulated wire of perhaps 50 or 1 00 turns, and of 4 or 5 inches in diameter. The

best place for the coU is immediately underneath the bottom of the balance-case.

Tt is then pretty near the lower pole of the magnet, and is yet out of the way.

The circuit is completed through a Leclanche cell and a common spring contact-

key, placed in any convenient position. The only precaution required is not to
tring other magnets into the neighbourhood of the balance, or at any rate not to
move them during a set of weighings.

     The other point as to which I wish to make a suggestion relates to the time of
vibration of the beam. 1 think that, with the view of obtaining a high degree of

sensitiveness, the vibrations are often made too slow. Now the limit of arcuracy

depends more upon the smalluess of the force which can be relied upon to displace
the beam in a definite manner than upon the magnitude of tlie displacement so

produced. As in other instruments whose operation depends upon similar

principles, e.g. galvanometers, it is useless to endeavour to increase the sensitiveness

by too near an approach to instability, because the effect of casual disturbances is
augmented in the same proportion as that of the forces to be estimated. If the
time of vibration be halved, the displacement due to a small excess of weight is
indeed reduced in the ratio of four to one, but it is not necessarily rendered any
more uncertain. The mere diminution in the amount of displacement may be
compensated by lengthening the pointer, or by optical magnification of its motions.

By the method of mirror-reading such magnification may be pushed to almost any
extent, but I am dealing at present only with an arrangement adapted for ordinary

use.

    In the balance (by Oertling) that I am now using, the scale-divisions are

finer than usual, and the motion of the pointer is magnified four or five times
without the slightest inconvenience by a lens fixed in the proper position. The
pointer being in the same plane as the scale-divisions, there is no sensible parallax.

In this way the advantage of qiiick vibrations is combined with easy visibility of
the motion due to the smallest weights appreciable by the balance.

     To illuminate the scale the image of a small and distant gas flame is thrown
upon it by means of a large plate-glass lens. This artificial illumination is found
to be very convenient, as the instrument stands at some distance from a window,

but it is not at all called for in consequence of the use of the magnifying lens.

      The question of the diffusion of metals, recently attacked by Dr. Guthrie at the

 ordinary temperature in the case of amalgams of mercury, has been e.xamined by

 Professor W. Chandler Roberts, who has dealt with metals having a higher
 melting point than lead. He shows by a series of careful experiments that while

 molten copper and antimony interpenetrate but slowly, the ' mobility ' of gold and
 silver in molten lead is comparatively rapid. Exact numerical determinations of the
 rate of passage have yet to be made, but the velocity of gold and of silver in
  molten lead is so great as to resemble the difRision of gases rather than the
  diffusion of a solid in a liquid. Professor Roberts has already extended his

 observations to silver and gold in molten bismuth, and, as Sir W. Thomson

  observed, the question is one of extreme importance and interest both to the
  physicist and metallurgist,

magnetic susceptibility and thermo-electric quality. Preliminary notices of some of
his earlier results have appeared in the ' Proceedings of the Royal Society ' (Nos. 214
and 216, 1881, and No. 220, 1882), but a detailed account of the work has still to
be given. Meanwhile the following points, not previously noticed, are perhaps of

sufficient interest to warrant their separate publication.

     In the experiments on magnetisation iron and steel wires were used, either
welded into rings or in the form of straight pieces whose length was great enough
to make the influence of the ends negligible. Curves were obtained, in some
cases by the baUistic method and in some by the direct maguetometric method,

showing the changes of magnetisation which occurred when magnetising force was

gradually applied, withdrawn, reapplied, reversed, and so on.

     The results of many experiments with several specimens of carefully annealed

--soft iron wires have shown that they possess, in very high degree, a property not

generally credited to soft iron the property of remaining strongly magnetic when

the magnetising force is removed.

     As an example, the case may be cited of an annealed iron wire which was

subjected to a magnetising force of 22'4 c.g.s. units. This gave it a magnetic
induction amounting to 16,000 c.g.s. units, corresponding to a magnetisation of

1,270. When the magnetising force was removed (gradually and completely) the

 induction fell only to 15,000. In other words, the intensity of residual magnetisa-

 tion was equal to nearly 1,200 c.g.s. units.
      Here more than 9.3 per cent, of the whole induced magnetisation survived the

 removal of the magnetising force and in many other cases the residual magnetism

 amounted to nearly 90 per cent. The somewhat extraordinary spectacle was thus

 presented of a piece of soft iron, entirely free from magnetic influence, and never-
 theless holding an amount of magnetism far in excess of what is ever held by a
 permanent magnet of the best tempered steel.

       In this condition, however, the magnetic character of the iron is highly unstable.
 The application of reverse magnetising force quickly causes demagnetisation, and
 the slightest mechanical disturbance has a similar effect. Gentle tapping removes
 nearly all the residual magnetism. Variations of temperature reduce it greatly,

 and so does any application of stress. On the other hand, if the iron be carefully

 protected from disturbance it seems that the residual magnetism disappears only
 very slowly, if at all, with the mere lapse of time.

        If, after magnetisation, the magnetising force be suddenly removed, the

 residual magnetism is (as might be expected) considerably less than when the
 force is removed gradually.

      The ratio of residual to total magnetisation is always small when the intensity
 of magnetisation is small, and passes a maximum when the intensity is increased.
 This maximum is particularly distinct in wires which have been hardened by

  stretching, but it occurs also in soft annealed wires. In one instance, where the

 wire had been hardened by stretching, the maximum ratio of residual to total

  magnetism was 060, which was given by applying and removing a magnetising
  force of about 10 c.g.s. units, but on the application of a force of 90 units the ratio

 fell to 0-.33. With steel the maximum in this ratio is less sharp, but still distinct.
  Neither in hard iron nor in steel is the ratio, even at its maximum, so great as in

  soft iron, where (as has been said above) it frequently reaches 0'9.
        During the first magnetisation of soft iron wires the ratio (k) of intensity of

  magnetisation (I) to magnetising force was generally about 200, sometimes nearly

  300. And by gently tapping the wire during the application of magnetising force

  this coefficient was on one occasion raised to the enormous value of 1,590. In the
  case alluded to the magnetisation went on so rapidly, as the magnetising force was
  increased, that a force of 1 c.g.s. unit gave an induction of 10,000.

        In this and other particulars the experiments have been strongly confirmatory
   of the idea that there is, in soft u'on, a static frictioual resistance to the rotation of
  the magnetic molecules, which is the principal cause of the remarkable retentive-
  ness described above, and which is overcome by mechanical agitation.

       Numerous measurements have been made of the energy expended in taking
  iron and steel through cyclic changes of magnetisation. For example, in chanring

                                                           DD2

the magnetism of one specimen of annealed iron wire from I = 1250 to I = - 1240,
and back, the amount of work done against magnetic friction (apart from any
induction of currents) was 1,670 centimetre-dynes per cubic centimetre of the
metal. In hardened iron, and especially in steel, the work done is far greater.

     The effects of stress on existing magnetism and on magnetic susceptibility have
been examined at great length. The most remarkable effects occur in wires which
have been hardened by stretching. In these the presence of a moderate longi-
tudinal tensile stress increases the magnetic susceptibility immensely for low values

of the magnetising force, but diminishes it for liigher values. It also increases,
very greatly, the ratio of residual to total magnetisation ; but both of those effects

pass a maximum when the stress is sufficiently increased.
     The whole subject is much complicated by the presence of the peculiar action

which, in previous papers, the writer has named hysteresis, the study of which, in
reference both to magnetism and to thermo-electric quality, has formed a large

part of his work.

       Variations in Atmospheric Pressure and Bainfall causing Oscillations in

        F.B.A.S.

     The investigations have been made at MaghuU, which is an agricultural district
about eight miles to the north-east of Liverpool, and relate to movements in the
underground water of the Triassic rocks, which lie beneath the surface of the
ground. The water in these rocks is by capillarity made to form an inchned plane
towards the sea, which at the point referred to has its surface at sixty feet above
mean sea-level. The water-plane was shown to be in a state exceedingly sensitive
to the following influences : namely, atmospheric pressure, lunar attraction, and

solar attraction.

     In order to determine the relative extent of these and other disturbing in-
fluences upon the water-plane, an artesian well was sunk in the Triassic rocks to
a point below mean sea-level, and the rise and fall of the column of water sixty feet
in height, freed from the friction in the rock, was used as the means of registering
those disturbances in the water-plane, by using a mechanical contrivance of a float
and drum, caused to revolve by clockwork, to trace a curve upon the diagram

paper.

    The curve showed the extent from moment to moment of the atmospheric
variations, and also the effects of the attraction of the sun and moon upon the

water-plane in producing oscillations in the first case and true semi-diurnal lunar
and solar tides in the latter case.

     The effect of the rainfall was also shown on the diagram.
     It was also shown that there were periods when all the forces which have been
named were in equilibriimi, the water-plane remaining in a state of perfect

quiescence during those periods.

method of treating it. This method was an extension of that made familiar to us

in the writings of Sir John Lubbock and used by Dr. Whewell. Their system,

however, was imperfect, inasmuch as it did not introduce what was most necessary,

viz., a fourfold classification of the tides, as follows: 1, a lunar direct tide; 2, a

lunar obverse tide                                                                       3, a solar direct tide ;  and 4, a solar obverse tide.               The author
                                                                                      ;

claimed to have shown that this classification, inasmuch as it introduced the con-

sideration of the difference between the lunar action, direct or obverse, when in the

southern hemisphere, as contrasted with the corresponding action when in the

northern hemisphere, gave a clue to the Imo of the diurnal inequality, and when

the effects were formulated in a series of tables the heights of successive tides

could be predicted with unprecedented accuracy. The author explained how he

had been helped in finding out this law of the inequality by means of a graphic

process, which exhibited the varying positions of the sun and moon, drawn to

scale, and the resulting heights of lunar and solar, direct and obverse, tides ; and he

disclaimed any opposition in liis method of treating the subject to the more exten-

sive theory favoured by the British                                                      Association                                              suggesting  only that, as  his (the

Great Britain. He regretted that this effort should languish for want of funds,

which ought to be forthcoming to the needful amount from the Association, since

amateurs were left to do so much at their own private expense.

The author then described his self-registering instrument, which had been

kindly placed in a suitable position by the harbour authorities at Fleetwood, the

whole constituting a suitable tidal observatory, and the registers were compared

month by month with those obtained at George's Pier, Liverpool. The paper

concluded by stating that tlie system of tables thus originated had been adopted

by the authorities of the Ilydrographic Department of the Admiralty for the last

six years, for Liverpool only, and had been inserted in the annual volume of Tide

Tables published by their authority.

3. On a Fundamental Theorem in the Dynamics of Non-JEuclidiau Space.
                  By Professor Robekt S. Ball, LL.D., F.E.S.

     The theorem contained in this paper has been familiar to the author for two or

three years. He had always thought hitherto that it must have been known to

mathematicians, as it seems to be of fundamental importance in elliptic space. It

is true that he never could find any reference to it, but he had been disposed to

attribute this to his ignorance of the literature of the subject. Professor Linde-

mann, who has done so much for this theory, had, however, assured him that the

theorem is new.

The effect produced on a rigid system by a pair of equal rotations about two

right lines which are conjugate polars to the absolute is called by Clifibrd a

riffht vector. If the rotations are equal, but with opposite signs, they constitute a
Aleft vector.
                   pair of equal forces on two conjugate polars we may call a rit/ht

couple, or a left couple, according to the way in which the forces are dh-ected.

The theorem now submitted is thus stated : The virtual moment between any

right vector and any left couple, or between any left vector and any right couple,

is equal to zero.

J*   The solution of (4) resolves  itself into one of  three forms, according                                                                                                                                          as (first)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                       -- J'27 ~ is
Jnegative, but / is still positive ; or (thirdly) I^ -- 27 · is negative, and I is negative;

--in each of wliich latter cases there is only one real root.

    In the first case we have the well-known solution of the cubic hy comparing it

with the trigonometrical identity

                        4 cos' a-- 3 cos a -- cos 3a = 0.

     In the second case it can be solved by comparison with the identity

                             4 cosh' a -- 3 cosh a -- cosh 3a = 0;

and in the third by comparison with

                              4 sinh' a + 3 sinh a -- sinh 3a = 0.

    [These identities are app.arent at once on using their exponential values.]

    First then, when /' -- 27J'^ is positive, we have

                        X = n cos a, where cos 3a = a //0'^7^--J-2
                                                                                                                                                                              ;

secondly, when I^ -- 27J'^ is negative, but 1 is positive,

                                                                      ""
                                                                                              ;

                                                       V27j'2

thirdly, when 1 is negative,

                        .r = M sin h a, where sin h 3a = a / '^^-^3
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

in each case n being numerically equal to a /^ and of opposite sign to J.

    It seems worthy of notice that, since the two quadratic factors into which the

liiquadratic can be split [see equation (2)] differ only in the sign of q, the biquad-

--ratic is equivalent to a single quadratic equation

in which q may have any one of six values-- namely, any one of the roots of the

cubic in q-. The six different forms of (5) are, of course, the six different combi-
nations-in-pairs of the linear factors of the biquadratic. It is easy to see from

this the intimate association of equal and zero roots in the cubic with equal

roots in the biquadratic : for if two of the roots of the biquadratic are equal, we
can only form four different quadratic expressions (5), and hence two roots of the
cubic must be equal. Again, if the biquadratic has two pairs of equal roots, the
two equal roots of the cubic must be zero, since only three combinations can be
made : and so on.

8. On Symmetric Fuvctions, and in imrtlcular on certain Inverse Operators
         in connection therewith} By Captain P. A. MacMahon, M.A.

     This paper is more particularly concerned with non-unitary symmetric functions,
on account of the author's recent discovery that they are in fact seminvariants of
an allied quantic. Some recent theorems in seminvariants are herein applied to the

calculation of synmietric functions.

     § 1. The equation considered is in every case

and if partitions in (        ) refer to this equation, and those in ((                                                                                                                                                )) to the

it is skowu that aj^-''((ft'«. y" . . . .)) represents tlie terms of highest degree in

symmetric fimction (X. . y"fi.'".             ) ; so that every known symmetric function

gives rise to the terms of highest degree in an infinite number of higher symmetric

functions, by simply making a unit-increase of suffixes throughout (a^ having been

introduced for the sake of homogeneity) and introducing a factor a^ raised to the

necessary power.

   A slmpUfication in the performance of Mr. Hammond's operator d,, is thence

derived.

     § 2. It is shown, from analogy with the theory of semmvariants, that the non-

unitary portion of a symmetric function may be separately calculated, and its

complete expression thence derived from a series of functions corresponding to the

coefficients of Prof. Cayley's generalised canonical form of quantics.

     § 3. Beginning with Mr. Hammond's operators, defined by the equation

          --dJx = -d + a,                  d           d

the following formula is proved, viz.

          -- = «4-^a,<?x+i + -ffc2A+2-                    +c-)'-h;,a+,-+ . .

wherein H,., represents the sum of the homogeneous symmetric functions of

weight r.
     This formula is applied to the calculation of symmetric functions, and various

properties of the function Jl(,.) are developed ; in particular it is proved that the
general term in If(r) is

                                   «! ! °2 ! "3 ! . . ,

7i being the degree of the term, which gives rise to the following curious theorem,

viz. : If in the expression of «S',, we multiply each term by the degree of the term,
and then di\-ide the whole expression by the degree of the expression, we obtain

i?(,i), and conversely.
     § 4. The following inverse operators are obtained, viz. :

          --T7- d" + ,,2oa.^--"d- + SrO,ag-"d--

                      = SA,-S,.+xd,^S,+,d..- . . . +(-)'A+A+ . . ·

and it is proved that
                                                    r_,(X')-=X(XV); r:;tX.

     The effect of the operator on certain other functions is considered.

     § 5. The definition of -^xi is extended, so that the function i/(xO has a definite
meaning, and it is shown that II(\i) bears the same relation to symmetric function

(X') that Hfx bears to (X), and is derivable from it in the same manner, viz. by
means of the theorem given a7ite.

   A method is given for calculating Su-.j where S"- .i represents the sum of all

the homogeneous symmetric functions of weight lo and of degree _;' at most.

the term containing ZTg.

functions, or, as they may be otherwise called, the single partition seminvariants, of

          9. On the most Commodious and Comprehensive Calculus.
                                 By Dr. Ernst Schroder.

   --The calculus of the four algebraical operations viz., addition, multiplication,
--and converse does not imply the greatest abundance of formal laws and conse-

quences. Accepting symbolically the notation a + b for a certain function /' («, b)
of two variables, and « . 6 or ab for another function (^ (a, b), a calculus is found
out to be the most comprehensive one that enjoys the following properties.

     Both functions are throughout one-valued ( = determinative) and invertible
they are commutative and associative, like the proper addition and multiplication
besides, they submit to the law, that whenever a + b -- c, then also b + c = a and
c + « = 5 ; again, when a .b = c, then also b .c = a, and c .a = b, so that every term
or factor may also be transferred as such to the other side (member) of any

equation.

    None of the distributive principles, as a .(b + c)-a .b + a .c, holds good between
the aforesaid operations, but instead of these we have the still simpler and ampler
law expressed by the formulae

                  (a + b) .c = (b + c) .a = (c + a) . b=n + ab-b + ca = (i + bc.

     Brackets in this calculus are therefore obliterated by simply cancelling them,
which yields the most commodious imaginable way of developing products of poly-

nomials. Moreover, in a series of operations it is allowed to confound any two
signs of addition and of multiplication.

Lastly (the formulae

                      a + = a,           a .l = a

                      a + a = 0,         a .a -- 1

proving gener.illy valid), the solution of an equation is most easily performed, when-

ever possible.

ordinary complex numbers, both proving generally discontinuous. First explain
them for a province of but two numbers, say and 1, by means of the tables

then extend their definition unto the province of the real numhers, supposing each
to be expressed in the binary scale (the negative numbers as ' arithmetical comple-
ments ' with an infinity of I's preceding).

     Then a + h and a. b ought but to represent the results of combining together the
homologous digits of a and b according to these tables.

     In order to avoid the particular fact that a + b would coincide with minus ab,
let the positive part of the axis of the real numbers be reflected into itself accord-
ing to any principle whatever, but such that the point would correspond to

itself Do then the same \nX\i the negative part, but according to any other prin-

ciple. Then the substitutes will evidently bear the same formal relations to each
other as the original numbers, provided, of course, that we now define ab as the
point or number representative of the symbolical product, heretofore described, of
those numbers whose representatives are a and b (and so on).

    Finally, the explanations may be extended to the ordinary complex numbers

                                            a + w X n/ -- 1

by simply combining together their real parts, and again the real coefficients of the

imaginary parts, according to the rules given.

10. Exposition of a Logical Frinciple, as disclosed hij the Algebra of Logic,

     hut overlooked hy the Ancient Logicians. By Dr. Ernst Scheoder.

     The algebra of logic being the concisest expression of the ' laws of thought

in the Boolean sense, enables us to discover gap* in the ancient system.

    By the method of Ch. Peirce the law of distribution

                                              a{b-tc) =ab + ac

is capable of being demonstrated through syllogisms, but merely as an implication
in the one sense, viz., it can be shown that n(b + c) implies ab + ac.

    The opposite implication has in a similar way never been proved, and the impos-
sibility of this proof being ever given may be demonstrated by means of a certain

' calculus with algorithms or calciilusses,' the notion of which is to be founded on
the foregoing communication.

     This implication, therefore, is to be considered as an independent axiom of
thought or logical principle.

    On June 10, 1875, we communicated to the Royal Society a paper containing
the observations of the heat of sunshine made by Campbell's method during the 24
years 1855 to 1874, and we now communicate to the British Association a second

series of such observations made between 1875 and 1882.
     The following extract from a Parliamentary Report will explain the process

adopted by Mr. Campbell :

   A' hemispherical cavity is made in a block of wood, and a spherical lens is

placed in this cavity in such a position that while its centre coincides with the
centre of the cavity its chief focus is at some point of the hemispherical concave
surface, the exact point being of course determined by the direction in which the
rays strike the lens.

     * Whenever, therefore, the sun shines, a portion of the wood will be carbonised

or burnt out hj his concentrated beams ; and inasmuch as the sun continually

changes his position, not only from hour to hour, but from day to day, it follows

that diiferent portions of the wood will be acted upon, not only from one hour to

another, but also from one day to another.'

The blocks are all of mahogany, being, as nearly as possible, of the same

quality                                     and the diameter of the sphere  is about 5| inches.
                                         ;

     All the blocks have been treated by us in the same way. The hollows burnt
out have been filled with a mixture of bees' wax and olive oil of such a consistency

that we could easilj^ work it into the burnt cavities until the whole internal

hemisphere should be made to present the same smooth surface which it had before
Ait was burnt.
                                            comparison of the weight of the (previously saturated) block

before and after the process was supposed to give us a good estimation of the
extent of the hollows. The mean of two such determinations was taken, and the

near concordance of the two will show that the results are as accurate as the nature

of the experiment requires.

    As the wax used for the second series was not necessarily the same as that tised
for the first, we caused six bowls of the first series to be refilled with the second
series wax and weighed, by which means we obtained the coefficient necessary to

reduce the second series to the same standard as the first.

There still, however, remains the fact that the first series were made at the

Board of Health (now the Local Government Board), at Richmond Terrace,

"Whitehall, while the second were made at the Kew Observatory.

The last bowl treated in the old series was that ending December 1874, and the

first of the new series, that ending June 1875, is defective, owing to the shadow of a
Wepost falling on it.
                                            have, therefore, rejected it from our list. Mr. Shaw,

student at Owens College, was good enough to assist us in the determinations of the

Kew set. The specific gravity of the mixture of wax and oil used for this set was,

at 74° C, 0-838, and the melting point was Gl-5° C.

In the following table we have the results obtained :

    It will be seen that in the above table we have results during two sun-spot
cycles nearly. If we divide (as has been done for the heights of rivers) the
interval between each solar maximum, without regard of its exact length, into
twelve equal parts, our data will give us values corresponding to two such sets
of twelve. If we further smooth our values by taking means of three, and if we
take the means of the two sets of twelve, we obtain finally one set of twelve values,

which will, perhaps, afford us a rough indication whether there is really a connection
between heat of sunshine, as herein determined, and sun-spot frequency, and
whether, as in the case of rivers, there are traces of a doable terrestrial period for
one of sun-spots.

    We thus obtain

     It would thus appear that, as far as we can judge from such limited data, there
 are, as in the case of rivers, and probably rainfall, traces of a double maximum for

 one of sun-spots. This, however, is a conclusion that cannot at present be regarded
 as established, but only as more or less probable.

5. On apparent Sun-spot Inequalities of Short Period. By Professor
     Balfoue Stewart, F.B.S., and W. Lant Carpenter, S.A., B.Sc.

By means of a method for detecting inequalities of unknown period in a mass

of observations, which has already been described to this Association, we liave

made some way in analysing sun-spot records, and have detected several apparent

inequalities of short period, while we are in hopes that we shall be able to show

that there is a definite relation between these and corresponding inequalities in

meteorology and magnetism.

We do not intend at present to raise the question as to the true or merely
Weapparent periodicity of these inequ-alities.
                                                simply take them as we find them,

and see whether there are corresponding apparent inequalities in meteorology and

magnetism, for it is ob-sious that there may be a true relation between celestial and

terrestrial inequalities quite apart from the question of their true periodicity.

Meanwhile it may be of interest to the Association to exhibit the most striking

evidence of repetition which we have obtained in the progress of our sun-spot

analysis. The observations analysed have been those of Schwabe, Carrington, and

De la Hue, extending over a period of thirty-six years, and these have been divided

into three periods of twelve years each. The inequalities for each year are

proportionally represented, so that each carries equal weight whether it be a year

of maximum or minimum sun-spots. In doing this the average of spots for each

--vear is reckoned = 1 ,000, the departures of each term of the year's inequality from

this average number being noted in red when deficient, and in black when in

excess.

As the departures for each year are added algebraically together, it will be

necessary for the twelve years series to divide the sums red or black by twelve, in

order to estimate the true extent of the inequality, and in like manner it will be

Whennecessary to divide the sums for thirt3'-six years by thirty -six.  this is done

we shall have the true measure of the positive (black) and negative (red) depai'tures

from the mean (1,000). In the following table, the numbers of which have not

been submitted to any smoothing process, we have represented the two most

prominent sun-spot inequalities which we have hitherto detected. It will be seen

from these that there is in each very marked evidence of repetition, the results

for the Iwelve years being very like each other.

    Di-viding the gross results by thirty-six, we have in the first of these inequalities
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                                   419

a positive departure = 124 and a negative = 89, representing a range between
extreme values of 213 for a mean value of 1,000. Again, in the second inequality
we Lave a positive departure = 131 and a negative = 104, representing a range
between extreme values of 235 for a mean value of 1,000. In both cases, therefore,
the range of oscillation is between one-fourth and one-fifth of the mean value.

freely suspended mngnetic needle will attain its most easterly position about 7
or 8 in the morning, and its most westerly about 1 or 2 in the afternoon, while in
the southern hemisphere the same end of the needle will be affected in a manner
exactly the reverse of this, the extreme west being attained about 8 in the
morning, and the extreme east about 2 in the afternoon. It thus appears that the
type of this variation is of an opposite nature in the two hemispheres. Further-
more, when the sun is north of the equator during our summer the northern type

predominates, and to some extent invades the other, so that the variation in the

northern hemisphere is increased, while that in the flouthern is diminisbed. During

our winter precisely the reverse takes place ; the variation in the southern
hemisphere being increased, while that iu the northern is diminished. Thus in

either hemisphere the diurnal variation is greatest iu summer and least in winter
that is to say, it is greatest when the sim acts most powerfully at the place

of observation.

    Ao-ain, the range of this variation is greatest at times of maximum sun-spots,

but the eiiect which the state of the solar surface produces upon the range lags in
poiut of time behind its solar cause, so that a maximun of maguetic range does not

take place until some time after a maximum of sun-spots. The most obvious
inference from this mode of action would seem to be that the magnetic effect is due

in some way to the indirect influence of solar radiation, and that this radiation is
strono'est when there are most sun-spots. So much for the best known eflect of the

Bun upon the magnetism of the earth.

    The second effect to which I will dow allude was first noticed by the late John
Allan Broun, who showed that changes of the earth's horizontal magnetic force,

whether tending to its increase or diminution, takes place nearly simultaneously at
the various recording stations of the earth. Here the horizontal component maj'
in all probability be regarded as giving us a convenient means of measuring changes
of total force, so tbat what these observations seem to imply is that the total

magnetic force of the earth changes simultaneously at these various stations. I

have recently found, on comparing Broun's results with the state of the sun's
smface, that an increase of the earth's horizontal magnetic force corresponds to an

increase of sun-spots, and a diminution of the eai-th's horizontal force to a

diminution of sun-spots, the effect here, as in the previous instauce, lagging some-
what behind its cause iu point of time. The difJerence between the two solar

effects now described would appear to be that in the former (the diurnal change)

we have a superposed variation of a different type from the earth's system, while
in the latter we have a variation having the same type as that of the earth, or at
least which may possibly be regarded as having the same type. Now the earth's

magnetic system is a polar one, and hence if the sun affects this system as a whole

we mav im'ao-ine that he does so by a variation of his influence (whatever this may

 be) over the north magnetic pole, or over the south magnetic pole, or over both

--poles together. Should the state of the sun's surface vary say, for instance, in
--the direction of an increase of power we may imagine that this would influence

both poles.

But, apart from intrinsic changes of the solar surface, the sun during our

summer may be imagined to exert a particularly powerful influence over the north

magneticpole, and during our winter over the corresponding pole in the southern

hemisphere. Again, a strong influence at either pole may reasonably be supposed

to affect the whole system, so that we might, perhaps, on theoretical grounds

--expect a strengthening of the earth's magnetic system twice a year namely, at the

solstices, the one being due to the polar action of the sun in the northern, the other

to his polar action in the southern hemisphere.

Now a semiannual variation of this nature has in fact been observed by Broun,

who has made his analysis so carefully that his results cannot be attributed to mere
Weinstrumental changes.
                         have from these an increase of the earth's horizontal

component at the solstices as compared with the equinoxes. In order to elucidate

this point, I have gathered together the various trustworthy determinations of

the annual and semiannual variations of declination, horizontal force, and dip at

stations in both hemispheres. These are exhibited in the following table :

Kewthe needle at the solstices, and particularly the siiiumer solstice, is at  and

Toronto pushed to the east, while at Trevandrum and Bornbav it is pushed to the

west, as if the north induction system had become particularly powerful on these

occasions. In conclusion, I wish to state that these remarks are introduced rather

as denoting a method of grouping together the annual and semiannual observations

than as embodying conclusions of a final nature. This working hypothesis may be

summarised as follows :
     (a) The sun's polar influence on the earth's magnetism is greatest at the

solstices.

     (|3) This effect is stronger at the June than at the Decemher solstice.
     (y) It seems particularly to aflect what has been termed the induction magnetic
system of the earth.

7. DescriiJtion of a Marine Anemometer. Bij Dr. W. G. Blacl', F.B.M.S.

     This instrument is designed on the idea of registering the pressure of the wind

on the sail of a ship for the purposes of the navigator.
      It therefore consists of a hollow mast, carrying a square sail, .suspended from a

fixed yard at the head, and having a free foot stretched on another yard below.
     The tube of the mast contains a spiral spring at the upper half, with a pointer

outside, and from this proceeds the sheet or a cord, going under a pulley at the
lower end, to be attached to the lower yard of the sail.

     The heel of the mast can be secured by suitable plinth and screw, and placed
on a railing or other likely structure on the bridge of the ship or steamer.

   A movable vane surmounts the head of the mast, and the sail can be turned by

hand to face the full direction of the wind, and the pressure on the sail can then
he read off on the scale on the side. This scale is marked in inches and pounds
and their parts, temporarily in the ratio of one inch to four pounds.

     Estimation of the true direction of the wind and its velocity and force can thus
"be obtained by constructing a diagram of parallelogram of forces of the wind and
rate of sailing. The diagonal would be furnished by the perpendicular line to the
face of the sail pointing to the apparent wind, and the required angle would be
read off from the dial of degrees marked on the circumference of the lower plinth.

             8. On a Method for Measuring the Height of the Cloncls.
                                   By Professor Luroth.

     This method simply consists of taking a strong electric lamp, together with a
reflector and a tube, and directing a pencil of luminous rays, .say vertically,
against the sky. These rays will produce within the cloud that occupies the
zenith a luminous spot, and it is only needful to determine the angular elevation
of that spot above the horizon from a distant point, whose position with respect to
the lamp is known ; hence the calculation of the height in question will be but one
of the simplest tasks in plane trigonometry. The method will of course best be
applicable during night, but it might also be used by daylight, if the sunshine is
not too bright. Still there might be limits as to the height for measurmg which
the method is capable of being adapted.

  0. On Fixing a Standard of White Light. By Captain Abnet, F.E.S.

     The author described an instrument which he had devised nine years ago, and
had used for comparison of the electric light and gas-light when serving on a
Government Committee. The comparison of incandescence light proved to be
highly instructive ; and eventually it was found that for obtaining a standard light

of high temperature, nothing could be better except the crater of the positive pole
of the electric arc. This latter has invariably the same temperature, as was sho-\vn
by the author and Colonel Festing in a paper which has recently appeared in the
J'roceedings of the Royal Society. It has, however, one insuperable drawback as
                         TfiANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                    423

a standard of white light, in that it is surrounded to a greater or less degree with

carbon vapour, which, though radiating hut little energy, yet radiates that energy

chiefly as bright bands in the green and the blue of the visible spectrum. Could

these bands be eliminated there is a temperature which is apparently constant, and

which, consequently, will radiate also the same proportionate intensity of rays.

Failing this, the incandescence lights ofler the next best standard; and though
when compared with daylight of an ordinary character they appear yellow even at

their highest practicable temperature, yet they are much whiter, containing more

proportionate green, blue, and violet than gas-light, taldng the red near the line

as equal in both cases. Again, we have another decided advantage over gas in the

fact that the body heated is a solid, and, for practical purposes, black. In gas-light

there is a decided preponderance of yellow and orange, compared with a solid

heated to the same temperature. Hence the 'spectrum range,' to coin a word, is
Amore accurate with the incandescent lamp than with the gas.
                                                              point that re-

quired investigation was as to whether all carbon-threads emitted the same relative
proportion of spectrum rays, and it was found that they did so, and that at what

is believed to be the same temperature, the proportion of these rays remained

constant. (The proportion was obtained by comparing it with ignited coal gas.)

Hence we arrive at one step in fixing a standard quality of light. The question
arises as to what temperature the carbon filament may be heated without endan-

gering the existence of the lamp. At one stage of heat in the carbon-thread of a

well-exhausted lamp there is a peculiar glow, which illuminates the bulb of the

lamp, and if that glow be examined by the spectroscope it will be found to consist

of four or five bright lines, due to carbon vapour in some shape or another ; and if

that temperature be maintained the carbon is found to be deposited as an impalpable

powder on parts of the glass globe, and eventually the thread breaks at the place

of greatest resistance. Below this heat the thread will remain unaltered for many

hours without any apparent change, always supposing the thread to have been

previously heated to such a degree as to give constant resistance at freezing point.

This is a matter of some importance, as in the experiments made new lamps in-

creased in resistance after a few hours' ignition as much as five per cent., and after

that remained constant, when heated to a temperature below that already indicated.

An investigation then took place regarding the intensity of radiation from an in-

candescent carbon filament and the energy and temperature. The results of these

experiments are given in the ' Phil. Mag.' September 1883, in which it will be seen

that after a certain temperature (dependent on the thickness of the filament and

the temperature of the surroundings) the radiation and the energy expended are

Adirectly proportional.  good fiducial temperature is when the carbon-thread is

just visible to the eye when examined in a darkened room, and is very nearly
630° C. If the energy at this temperature be accurately measured by means of

the current and the electro-motive force, and if the resistance be measured at the

temperature of melting ice, the temperature of filament at just below the point

below which the carbon lines appear can be readily obtained by diminishing the

resistance of the carbon filament by half. This has been found to be approximately

the temperature required. Another check-method is to note the radiation bj-

means of the thermopile at the point of first visible incandescence, and to increase

the energy expended till the radiation noted is forty times as great. This can be

effected with great facility, and the quahty of light radiated is in this case in-

variably the same, as it is indeed if any other proportion be taken.          ;

experiments to ascertain the correctness of the law with greater exactitude.)

potentials the Watts can be calculated, and also from the corrected currents and
potential, the latter being found to be more accurately observed than the former.
The same curve is adopted for the resistances. The resistances, current, and Watts
will be found to be nearly coincident when calcidated from the direct observations
or from the corrected curves of current and potential. To find the constant n the
observations of corrected Watts and deflections are plotted, the one as ordinates,
and the other as the abscissae to the curves, when it will be found that the curve
at any temperature above 530° C. is a straight line, and n is thus readily obtained
either by calculation or by a graphic method, as is also in.

     The constant h can be obtained by observing the resistance at 530°, the tempe-
rature when luminous radiation just commences.

    By this plan all constants are known, and any required temperature can be
obtained by increasing the potential, and if necessary introducing a known resist-

ance in the circuit. In choosing an incandescent solid, however, there are certain
conditions that require attention. In the first place the section of the radiating
body should be uniform, and also homogeneous. The carbon threads such as those

prepared by Edison meet this condition as fully as practicable. This may be readily

ascertained by passing a current of such an intensity through the filament as just
to cause it to be at a red glow when seen in a darkened room. If the filament be
uniform in section and homogeneous, the glow will be seen to be equally bright in
every part of its length, no dark patches being apparent. Another condition which
also should be fulfilled theoretically is that the body should radiate on to matter
which is everywhere of uniform temperature, or nearly so. In an ordinary in-
candescence lamp this is not quite the case, for if the filament be of the form of a
simple loop, the two legs must radiate one on to the other, and the inner surfaces

should have a higher temperature. At the distance apart at which these legs are
placed this diificulty does not arise, but in making a standard lamp it is proposed
that it should radiate from a single thread. The best method of construction of
such a lamp the Committee propose to submit in a subsequent report.

     The light which it is proposed to emploj^ as a standard of quality is as follows.

--Taking the colour of Mr. Vernon Harcourts standard as a comparison light the

red (at the C line of the solar spectrum) being taken as equal in the two lights, the

Elight at in the new standard should be 1'5 times that of the gas-light ; the increase

in intensity of the liigher radiations will then follow of necessity. Compared witli

the electric light this increase in the green is small, as the increase in the green of
the crater light (positive pole) is very nearly three times that of gas-light.

    When possessed of one lamp of which tlie necessary constants for the production

of the standard temperature are known, any other lamp which has a uniform fila-

ment may be standardised by direct comparison with it by increasing or diminishing

the current till the shadows as thrown by the Kumford photometer on a white screen
appear of the same tint. It will be found that a very slight alteration in current
from the point at which the shadows appear equal in brightness and similar in colour
will alter the latter. By this plan the original standard may be preserved for a
considerable period, the second lamp taking its place in all photometric or other

experiments.

    The metliod of obtaining an exact quality of light has now been indicated, and

the quantity of light radiated can easily be proved by direct experiment. It is pro-
posed that the amount of candle-light (so called) be obtained by measuring with a
photometer the standard light proposed by jNIr. Vernon Harcourt with the lamp at
the given temperature, the observation being made through a cell, the plates of

which are 1 mm. apart, filled with an aqueous solution of iodine and iodide of
potassium made as follows :
TEAXSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                   425

Iodine            ...        1 centigramme.
Potassium iodide
Distilled water   ..  .  .2 centigramDies.

                         .10 c.c.

     The cell, filled with this solution, to he held between the eye and the photo-
meter whilst the obserration is made, in order to render each light of approximately

the same colour. When using the lamp as a standard of quantity the loop of the

filament should be vertical and its plane at right angles to the photometer screen.

It will be seen that by this plan a lamp of any ' quantity ' may be standardised, so

as always to radiate the same ' quality ' of light.

           10. On the Dependence of Total Radiation on Temperature.
                     By Sir William Siemens, D.G.L., F.B.8.

     On April 25, 1883, the author presented a paper bearing the same title to the

Koyal Society, in which he developed a method of determining the total radiation
and the temperature of a metallic conductor traversed by an electric current by
measuring that current and also the electric potential between the terminals.

     In an article appearing in the ' Philosophical Magazine ' of September 1883, by
Captain Abney and Colonel Festing, these authors admit the method to be one of
'great promise,' but consider it defective for two reasons, viz., that

      (1) Platinum (the conductor employed in some of the experiments) is not black
at ordinary temperatures, and

     (2) Much of the energy must have been dissipated by convection currents.
     They proceed to describe a modification of the same method, substituting car-

-- --bon filaments in vacuum such as Swan or Lane Fox lamps for the metallic con-

ductors, with a view of avoiding the difficulties just stated. Following up the

same modified method, Captain Abney now proposes to base upon it a method of

fixing a standard of white light.
      Sir William Siemens takes exception to this proposal, maintaining in the first

place that the objections urged against his method admit of explanation, and in the
next that the proposed substitution of carbon for metallic conductors would

introduce questions of great difficulty.

     The objection raised against platinimi wire that it is not black when cold
would be easily met by the substitution of platinised platinum wire, and, in testirg

the black platinised against the bright platinum wire, an interesting comparison
between the radiation from a black and bright surface through a long range of
temperature could be established. In exposing the wire under examination to the
atmosphere convection currents were no doubt set up which went in deduction of

total radiation. To avoid these he had suspended his wires within exhausted re-
ceivers, but found tliat the atmospheric density made no appreciable difference in

the result. When the gaseous pressure was reduced below that of a millimetre of

mercury, the loss of heat otherwise than by radiation was observed to increase on
the contrary, pointing to the fact, previously determined by Mr. Crookes, that

rarefied air is a conductor of heat.

     But, supposing that the rarefaction within the bulb of an incandescence lamp
exceeds the limit at which conduction takes place, losses by convection currents
must nevertheless take place, exceeding those from the unprotected wire, because
the glass bulb itself absorbs a large proportion of both the low heat and the ultra-

-- --violet rays as evidenced by its elevated temperature which heat was communi-

cated to the air by convection currents. It must be borne in mind that the surface
of the bulb exceeded that of the ignited carbon thread nearly a hundredfold, giving
rise to increased loss by convection.

     The substitution of carbon for metallic wire was, moreover, objected to on the
ground that although the electrical resistance furnished a safe indication of tem-
perature in the case of metallic conductors, carbon was known to be afl^ected
very irregularly in the opposite sense. Those physicists who had endeavoured
to establish a law of dependence between temperature and conductivity of carbon-
--426 EEPOKT 1883.

rods had failed hitherto to arrive at any consistent results, and it would he neces-
sary under these circumstances that such dependence should he established upon
a lirm basis before it could be admitted as an accomplished fact in photometry.

                      11. On a Lamp giving a Constant Light.
                    By A. Veknon Harcoukt, M.A., F.B.S.

      Six years ago the need of a standard light for photometry, and a proposal to obtain
such a light from a burner of simple construction, consuming a definite mixture of
air and petroleum vapour, were brought before this Section. The composition of the
' air-gas ' and the height of the flame were so adjusted that the light, which was
easily kept constant, was equal to the average light of one of the sperm candles

made for photometry. Two years later, the attention of the Board of Trade

having been called to the uncertainty as to the quality, or price, of gas supplied
by the gas companies, arising from the variable character of the standard
candles, a committee, consisting of Dr. Williamson, Dr. Odling, and Mr. G.
Livesey, was appointed to inquire into existing and proposed photometric
standards. After a prolonged inquiry, the details of which are printed in a
Report to the Board of Trade, the committee pronovmced sperm candles to
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                            427

he imtrustworthy as a standard of light, and recommended the employment
in their stead of the air-gas flame. At present the Board of Trade have taken
no action npon this Keport, and the quality of the gas which the companies

are to supply remains in the hands of the candle-makers. The lamp now
placed hefore the Section, and represented by the ahoTe figure, is the result

of an attempt to bring the air-gas standard into farour by giving it a simple and
portable form. The burner and the flame are identical with those to which reference

has been made. But to form the standard gas, instead of 3 cubic feet of air
mixing in a holder with I'Oo cubic foot of vapour formed from 9 cubic inches
of standard petroleum, or pentane, the air and vapour mix hi a small reservoir, and
thence flow down to the burner. At one point the diameter of the pipe through

which they flow is reduced, and this reduction and the height of the reservoir are

so related that when a mixture in the above-named proportions is entering the pipe

it burns with a flame of the standard height of 2^ inches. In constructing the
lamp the aperture in the tube or height of the reservoir was varied until the light

given by the lamp was exactly equal to that given by the standard flame obtained
from air-gas made up in the holder. With a lamp thus constructed the height of
the flame depends upon the proportion in which air and the heavy vapour are

mixed. If there is more air the density of the mixture and the consequent flow
are reduced ; and also the poorer gas burns with a shorter flame. If there is more

pentane vapour the density of the mixture and the consequent flow are increased;
and also the richer gas burns with a longer flame. Thus to each height of flame
belongs, for the same lamp, a particular mixture of air and vapour. This lamp has
been so made that the standard mixture produces-- and no other mixture can
produce--the standard height of flame. The flame of the lampis therefore iden-
tical with the pentane flame which has been tested and used hitherto. And, as

the construction of the lamp involves no small measurements, other lamps can

readily be made which, fed with the same liquid and adjusted to give a LH-inch

flame, will give the same light as this lamp.

The means by which the height of the flame may be adjusted will be understood

from the figure. By the turning of a screw water is forced into the reservoir, and

the surface^f the pentane which floats vipon the water is raised nearer tlie mouth

of the pipe down which the air-gas flows. The proportion of pentane vapour is thus
Aincreased ; it is diminished by lowering the level.
                                                      supply of pentane approxi-

mately equal to the consumption is furnished from a bulb and stopcock which

delivers a drop about once in five seconds ; and a supply of heat is brought by a

rod and disc extending above the flame at a distance and inclination which must be

varied according to the temperature of the room in which the lamp is used._ It is

only necessary that the supply of heat should not be so small as to require the

raising of the pentane to the top of the pipe, nor so large as to give a high flame

when the surface of the liquid is at a low level. None of the adjustments named

has been found difficult in practice.

                       13. On the Internal Constitution of the Sun.
                       By Professor Arthur Schustee, F.B.S.

     The idea that the sun is a gaseous body is gradually gaining ground. It could
not be otherwise, for the interior of the sun cannot be permanently at a lower

temperature than the surface, which we know to be sufficiently hot to volatilise

some highly refractory metals.
     If the sun is a gaseous mass it must be in convective equilibrium, and the

distribution of temperature within it must be determined by the adiabatic law.
Only thus could its small density be explained.
     ----

428 EEPOBT-- 1883.

     Opinions such as these have been independently expressed in different parts of the
world, but no one, the author thinks, has subjected them to the test of calculation.

     It is rather curious that, as far as he is aware, the problem of the internal
equilibrium of a gaseous gravitating mass has not as yet been discussed. Such a
mass will arrange itself in concentric layers round its eenti-e of inertia, and the

question arises. What is the distribution of density and pressure within ? It is

exceedingly probable that the problem has been attempted, for it is perfectly easy

to write down the differential equation which contains the result. But then the
differential equation has to be solved. If we suppose the temperature constant
throughout the gas, we cannot express the result in closed form; if the temperature
is regulated by the adiabatic law, we must take account of the ratio between the
two specific heats. For two different values the equation can be solved, and as the
ratio for all known gases happens to lie between these values, we may at any rate
get some information from a consideration of these special cases. If the ratio
between the two specific heats is 1'2, the following system of equations gives the

result :

                                                    27 c»

Here p represents  the  pressure                             p, the                          density                                r, the distance from the centre of
                                                          ;                                                                      ;

of radius and round the centre of mass ; c is a constant of integration to be deter-

Amined by the conditions of the problem, and depends on the nature of the gas

--(p=Ap'). The total mass of the gas is --^ ^--^ -, as we see by putting r

infinitely large in the last equation.

     The gas extends to an infinite distance, as only there the density and pressure
vanish ; the distribution of temperature is, of course, also determined by the

equations.

     The second case, for which the differential equation is easily solved, is that in
which the gas has its specific heat for constant pressure exactly t\\-ice that of con-

Astant volume. With the same notation as above, only puttiug a = ^2nij,

                        \/p= - sin ar

                                                                                     ·

                                                             r

                        M= --2e                                                         (sin  ar -- arcoaar).
                                           -

Here the mass of gas is limited, for the equations have only sense as long as ai-

--remains between o and Stt. When, therefore, ?· has become equal to , the

--pressure and density are nothing, and the total mass is equal to ^'^.

     It would be interesting to inquire for what value of ^- (the ratio of the two specific
heats) the mass begins to arrange itself into a finite sphere. The author believes
that this occurs when this ratio is equal to |, but cannot offer any absolute proof.
The highest value which k can have is If, and this value holds approximately for
mercury vapour ; it is very probable that the value of h in the interior of the sun,
where molecules wUl no doubt be broken up, as far as they can be broken up by
heat, will not be far from the same number. To follow out the calculation in this
----

case we should have to use approximate methods, and these are very difficult to

apply to our special problem.

    He will therefore in the present paper confine himself to the two cases which can
be accurately solved, and give the answer to the following question : What would
be the radius of a sphere having on its surface a temperature such as that we ap-

proximately know, and also having a vapour-density not far diflerent from that of
known bodies ? If the ratio of the two specific heats is 1*2, he finds that, taking
account of the total mass, the radius of the sun would have to be more than a million
times larger than it really is ; no possible value for the temperature of the surface
or the mass of the sun could bring the radius within the required limits.

    Taking the second case, or k = 2, we find that for the same surface condition the

--radius of the sun would have to be very small indeed almost vanishingly small.

The enormous difference in the results for the two values of k is surprising, but it
is so far satisfactory as our sun has a radius which is, as it ought to be, intermediate
between the two extreme values.

     One more interesting question, which he will mention only in this place, can be
easily discussed by means of our equations. It is that which refers to the change
of temperature and size of a gaseous body owing to loss of heat by radiation.

     Cette question ayant une grande importance pour la constitution de la couronne

quelques raies obscures, D, b, etc. Ce resultat fut confirm^ par quelques observa-

It hence easily appears that any given function of m, v can, by aid of the five

     This form containing 4 arbitrary constants, it follows that in general any given

mmatrix of the second order can be expressed as a function of and n ; for there

Dwill be four linear equations between A, B, C, and the four elements of the given

matrix. But this statement is subject to two cases of exception.

The first of these is when n and ?« are functions of one another: for in this case
A Bm P+Dmn+ + Cn +

disposable constants wherewith to satisfy the four linear equations.

The second case is when the determinant of the fourth order formed bv the

elements of the four matrices     ' '"    vanishes :                                  writin»g    m, n-\ _}^ \-\                                                                                                                                                                                                   T,,

respectively, it is not difficult to show that the value of this determinant is

        = (^.^3-^3^3)'+ {(^1-^4) ^2-(^i-r,) Q{{t,-t,) r3-(ri-r,) ^3}.

    This expression is a function of the five parameters b, c, d, e, f, as may be shown

in a variety of ways.

     Thus it is susceptible of easy proof that if /n,, p.^ are the roots of the equation

the function on the left hand is the invariant (discriminant) of the ternary quantic

appurtenant to the corpus, and we have this invariant = as the necessary and

sufficient condition of the involution of the elements of the corpus : the invariant in

question is for this reason called the involutant.

    Expressing the values of the coefficients in terms of the elements of the two

matrices, viz.

                           2b^i, + t,,               2e = T,+T,,

it at once appears that the two expressions for the involutant are, to a numerical

factor ^;;-es, identical.

It can be shown a priori that the involutant of a corpus of the second order

must be expressible in terms of the coefficients of the function                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  and  therefore,  being
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

obviously iiivariantive in regard to linear substitutions impressed on m, n it must

be also invariantive for linear substitutions impressed on z, x, y, and must therefore

be the invariant of the function. The corresponding theorem is not true, it should

be observed, for the involutant of a corpus beyond the second order ; for such invo-

lutant cannot in general be expressed in terms of the coefficients of the function.

The expression for the involutant in terms of the ^'s and r's may also be ob-

tained directly from the equation (wj-|liJ (ra-i/j) = 0. To this end it is only

necessaryto single out any term of the matrix represented by the left-hand side of

the equation and equate it to zero : the resulting equation rationalised will be found

to reproduce the expression in question.

     I have thus indicated four methods of obtaining the involutant to a matrix-

corpus of the second order ; but there is yet a fifth, the simplest of all, and the
most suggestive of the course to be pursued in investigating the higher order of

involutants.

mn-nm1 observe that for a corpus of any order the fanction           is invariant! ve for

many linear substitution impressed on and n. Its determinant will therefore he an
m minvariant for any substitution impressed on and n. When and n are of the second

order, reducing each term of {nm-tmi)-, i.e. mnmn-mn-m -- nm"n + nmmn, and of

mn - nm, by means of the three identical equations to the form of a linear function of

mn, m, n, 1, it will be found without difficulty that there results the identical equa-
mn-nmtion {mn-mii)"-i l=0,the coefficient of
                                              vanishing. Consequently the

determinant of the matrix mn - nm is equal to /, which on calculation will be found

to be identical with the invariant of the ternary quadric function.

  --It is obvious from the three identical equations that if m, n are in involution^

that is, if their involutant is zero every rational and integral function of m, n will

be in involution with every other rational and integral function of m, n. Hence

follows this new and striking theorem concerning matrices of the second order

/If {m, n) and <^ (ni, n) are any rational functions whatever of m, n, the deter-
mn-nmminant to the matrix                     is contained as a factor in the determinant to the

[It may be noticed that/, (f> need not be integer functions by stipulation, because

any linear function o{ mn, m,n, I, divided anteriorly or posteriorly by a second like

function, can itself be expressed as a linear function of the same four terms.]

    As a very simple example of the theorem, observe that the determinant of

m-n-mnm will contain as a factor the determinant oi mn-nm.

    3. On a Modification of Bimsen's Ice Calorimeter. By Professor

                                    Balfour Stewart, F.B.8.

     This instrument was exhibited to the Section. It was designed in order to

obviate the experimental difficulties attending the use of Bunsen's calorimeter.
In it the tube containing water is retained as the essential part of the instrument,
but instead of being fused into an outer vessel filled with ice it is fused into the

bulb of a large spherical mercurial thermometer, after the manner of Favre and
Silbermann, so that while the inside contains water the outside is in contact with
the mercury of the thermometer. The whole thermometer-bulb is inclosed in a
copper envelope, which surrounds it without contact, and this copper envelope is
kept at 0° C. by being surrounded with melting ice. Under these circumstances the
temperature of the thermometer will also be at 0° C. This temperature is recorded

--by a very open scale, so that a small rise may be easily seen. The experiment is

made as" follows : After the whole has been surrounded sufficiently long with
melting ice, the substance whose specific heat we wish to find is dropped into the

ice-cold water of the tube. Its heat is then rapidly communicated, first to the
water, and from it through the glass of the tube to the mercury of the thermometer,
and the rise of temperature of the latter is recorded on its stem. Theoretically a
slight correction has to be made for the heat which is given out during the progress
of the experiment by the (now) heated thermometer to the copper envelope which

surrounds it ; but in practice this may be disregarded, and the instrument is found

to give us a rapid and sufficiently accurate method of determining the specific heat
of such substances as can only be procured in small quantity. In using the
instrument it is desirable to have a small quantity of mercury at the bottom of the
water in the glass tube, by which means the heat is more rapidly communicated.

  4. On some Measurements of Glacier-Motion in 1883. By Professor
                                 Arthur Schuster, F.B.S.

   A change has once more taken place in the general motion of Swiss glaciers,

for they are again pushing forward into the valleys. For a year or two it had

been noticed that their upper ends increased in bulk, and now there is no doubt
about the steady advance. The author's personal information has been gained in the
Chamonix valley, but the reports from different parts of Switzerland seem aU to
':

       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                                433

 agree, and even tlie Rosenlaui Glacier, which a few years ago seemed doomed to
 total annihilation, is recovering and increasing. That the general advance will not

 remain without its exceptions is more than probable from previous experience. He

 is speaking only about the majority of glaciers in the western Alps, for he has
 heard nothing as to the behaviour of the ice in the Engadiue or in the Tyrol.

      It was generally said in Chamonix, during this last summer, that the lower end

 of the Glacier des Bossons came forward at the rate of one metre a week. He went

 on AVednesday, July 11, to mark some rocks at the base of the glacier, which was
 then melting rapidly, in order to see whether the downward motion really over-
 balanced the decrease by fusion. The eastern side of the glacier rested against a
 large boulder, while at the western end only loose stones covered the ground in

 front of the ice. He returned on Monday, the 23rd, and noted the following change

 The eastern end rested still against the same boulder, covering it exactly to the
 same spot as before ; and so unchanged did this side appear that one might have
 imagined it was the same ice that formed the end of the glacier. The ice which
 had melted against the rock was replaced by the advancing glacier, but no change
 in the position of the front could be seen. Not so on the western side. Here a
 thick tongue of ice projected from the glacier, and reached over one metre further
 down the valley than the former limit of the glacier.

      Here we have, then, in the middle of summer an actual advance of the glacier,

 which, though not so large as reported, is yet already sufficiently important, and
 will be still more so as the season advances and the melting takes place less

 rapidly.

      The weather during the interval between his two visits had, with the exception
 of two hot days, been rainy and bad, but it was never exceptional!}" cold.

     He also took some rough sights to see whether the level of the glacier at the

 point where tourists generally cross it is rising or not, but it seemed, if anything-,

 to be lower on his second visit than on his first.
      It seemed interesting, on account of this forward motion of the lower end of

 glaciers, to study once more their daily rate of descent. As glaciers flow down the
 valleys, and melt away on their surface and front, tliey will appear to advance or
 to retreat, according as the gain by daily downward motion overbalances or not
 the loss by melting. It seemed, therefore, probable that the daily motion was
 more rapid now than it had been while the glaciers were retreating, and this

 seemed only a consequence of the fact that the upper ends of the glaciers were

 generally acknowledged to be much higher and bulkier than of late years. The
 author's results do not, as 'W'ill appear, allow us to draw any very certain inference
 on that point ; but the cause of this uncertainty is worth relating.

     He undertook to make a series of measurements on stakes placed along an

approximately straight line across the Mer de Glace, a little higher up than the
Montanvert. The theodolite was firmly placed on shore. Measurements were
taken on the morning and afternoon of .July 21, on July 24 and 25. They
revealed an irregularity of motion which has not, to his knowledge, been

previously observed.

     To Forbes we owe the first series of accurate measurements, and the following
quotation will show that his observations pointed to a very regular advance of the

glacier :

    ' (5) When we compare the motion of a given point of a glacier any day of

one year and the same day of another, the probability is that the velocity will

be exactly the same, if the season be equally liot or cold ; hence, surely, a most
unexpected result, which I first announced in 1S42, that a few daxjs' obsei-vation
of a glacier icill enable anyone to compare its mean rate of motion over its various

parts and with dif[erent glaciers. Thus the motion of a point marked D2 on the
Mer de Glace was, in 1842 from August 1 to August 9, \Q^ inches daily; from

August 9 to September 16, 18 inches. Now next year, 1843, one observation gave

16 inches, and in 1844 one observation in September gave 17j inches. But still
further (6), the very law of flexure of the ice is the same from year to year ; a

series of stations across the ice at the MontaiiYert gave, in 1842, tJie following'
(simiiltaiieous) relative velocities :

                  1-000               1-332       1-356                                                                                            1-367.

The same points being recovered in 1844, the relative motions were (by a single
observation of the space moved over in five days) :

                  1-000          1-339            1-362                                                                                            1-374;

ratios almost the same, but slightly increasing, which corresponds with the fact

mentioned above (3), tliat when the absolute velocities are greater the relative
velocities are so too, which was here the ease, for the velocity denoted by TOOO
was a little greater in the second case than in the first.'

     Professor Tyndall, who in many ways extended Forbes's observations, has such

faith in the regidarity of that motion that in all his researches he assumes it as an
invariable fact which does not require any further testing, for, according to the
published accounts, the daily motion seems, with one exception, to be always
obtained from a single set of measurements. But Tjndall also noted a sudden
motion of a few inches at one place ; and if such sudden disturbances do take

place, it is evidently better to obtain the average daily motion from observations
taken as close together as possible, as only then would these sudden slips be

eliminated.

     The author's observations are not favourable to great regularity of glacier-
motion, but in bringing them forward he is well aware of the great evidence on
the other side, and he therefore gives them only as an example that great irregu-
larities may occasionally take place.

    He gives in a table the average hourly motion in centimetres in the different

stakes between July 21 , 24, and 25 respectively :

The first stake was placed about 70 metres from the western end of the glacier,

the successive distances to the other stakes being in metres 47, 53, 26, 20, 48, 47,

-92. The last stake was just within the eastern moraine.

    A glance at the table will show that the glacier-motion during the first three

days of observation was much less rapid than during the last, and this is especially

striking on the eastern side, where the last stake had actually moved during the

last nineteen hours two and a half times further than during the previous seventy

hours, the hourly motion being nine times as large in the second period. The

relative motion between the eastern and western ends was preserved during the

time over which the observation extended. At first it was the western end which
moved more quickly, but during the last days the eastern end followed so rapidly

that the total average for the four days shows a greater movement of the eastern

side.

     It is needful to add a word as to the accuracy of these niunbers, as the author
would not wish to press them against the much more extended series of measure-

ments given by Forbes and Tyndall, unless he felt pretty sure that they fairly well

presented the actual motion of the glacier during the period of observation. He

may say at once that he does not pretend to rival the accuracy of former observers.
His instrument was only divided to minutes, but the errors of setting were much

smaller, and half-minutes could easily be estimated. Nevertheless he will assume

that an error of  one minute     has  actually been made                                                                                           this would imply an error of

unfavourable case vre might therefore have for the hourly motion of the last stake in
the two periods 1 and 3-9 centimetres instead of 0*6 and o-o ; that is, we should
stiU ha-se to deal with an hourly motion nearly four times as great at one time as
at another. But the whole run of the observations shows that none but systematic
errors could account for the discrepancy, and he has endeavoured to avoid such
systematic errors by choosing two fixed points of reference, one of which should be
nearly in a line with the stakes and the other as nearly at right angles to it as
possible. In the actual case tlie angular distance between the two first points
was about 113°. The regular and consistent agreement between measurements of
that distance on different days is, he thinks, a fair test of the absence of systematic

eiTors. He need not here alhule to the other and obvious precautions to be taken

in the setting up and levelling of a theodolite. The stakes were not planted
sufficiently deep into the ice, and were often found inclined ijut of the vertical or
even removed from their proper place. They had been planted near the ordinary
tourist-track across the glacier, and were apparently considered by some of them to
be placed there for their special benefit, to be taken out and used as alpenstocks.

Two of them disappeared in this way, but the holes in which they had stood could

always be recovered, and as the point of the stick sighted was always its junction
with'the ice, and as the sticks were always placed vertical with a plumb-line before
each measurement, no appreciable error is due to any displacement of the sticks.

     The author considers, however, that the best confirmation of the results of the
measurements is to be found in the fact that, independently of the theodolite, he
could trace that same irregularity by simply looldng along the line of sticks from

convenient positions.

      The stakes had been planted already on July 18, and he could, without taking
 any measurements, see that even from that date up to the 21st the eastern side of
the glacier had advanced very little on the eastern side compared to the western,
while on the last day the sticks seemed to be again much more in a straight line
than they had previously been. The eastern moraine near the place where the
 eighth stick was placed showed signs of disturbance during the night of July
.23-24, which had been stormy, snow having fallen considerably below the

 Montanvert.
      It is not easy to compare the average motion of the glacier with that of previous

 obsei-vers, because the rate of motion seems to vary considerably with the place

 across which the stakes are placed.

     When Forbes measured the glaciers were advancing, and the rate of motion

 seems to have been increasing between the vears 1842 and 184G (p. 189) ; the
 motion opposite the Montanvert seems to have been at the rate of about 2 feet a
 day, or about 2-5 centimetres an hoiu-, and was therefore about as large, probably
 a little larger, than during the night of July 24-25 of the present year, considerably

 larger, however, than during the period July 21-25.

      Professor Tyndall made a series of observations on the 3Ier de Glace in the year
 1858 ; ' the place chosen for the author"s measurements coincides approximately
 with his line bb*. His measurements give 7 inches on the western side and a
 gi-adual increase to 26 inches on the east ; the hourly motion would therefore vaiy
 from about 0-7 to about 2-7 centimetres; the relative motion of east and west is not
 very far different from that observed during the last night's observation ; the total
 motion seems a little smaller than during that night, but in the view of the alto-
 gether difierent result arrived at this year during the period July 21-24 no trust-
 worthy comparison can be established. Professor Tyndall has kindly informed the
 author that, according to his recollection, the Mer de Glace was already retreating
 when he made his observation. By comparing the author's measurements with
 his, it would seem that during the first period some cause prevented the regular
 motion of the eastern side of the glacier, which cause gave way on July 24, and
 during the ensuing night the relative motion of the eastern and western sides came
 into good agreement with that previously observed by Professor Tyndall.

      It is much to be desired that further measurements should be undertaken, in order

     ·5. Note on some recent Astronomical Experiments at High Elevations

                     in the Andes. By Ralph Copeland, Ph.D.

     In the earlier part of the paper the author narrates the circumstances which
led him to undertake these experiments on his return from an expedition to observe
the last transit of Venus, and the exceptional difficulties encountered, owing to the

season of the year and the state of alfairs in northern South America. He also

expresses his obligation to Lord Crawford for the loan of instruments and other

help, and to the lloyal INIail Steam Packet, tlie Panama Railway, and to the Pacific
Steam Navigation Companies for liberal aid, and especially to Mr. Thorndike,

lessee of the remarkable railway whicli, starting from [Mollendo, on the Pacific,
crosses the Western Andes at a height of 14,(J66 feet, terminating at Puno, on

Lake Titicaca, 12,505 feet. On arriving at Viucocaya (14,360 feet), the loftiest
station on this line, the author found that the weather was so unsettled that he
went on with some of the lighter instruments to La Paz, in Bolivia (12,050 feet).
His experiences are thus narrated.

     ' La Paz bemg on the second chain of the Andes from the coast, the weather
there was not nearly so bad as at Viucocaya. Unfortunate^ it was full moon, so

that I had not a very good chance of testing the purity of the air, but on the night
of February 21, when the moon was almost exactly full, and at the same altitude,
but more than 90° from the constellation of the I3ull, I made a naked-eye sketch
of the Hyades and Pleiades. In the Pleiades I distinctly made out ten stars,
D.M. + 24°, 55o and 556, which are both 7'0 mag., being seen as one star, and
D.M. + 24°, 546, of G'3 mag., beiug clearly visible. In the head of Taurus I made
out seventeen stars, two of which, D.M. + 10°, 586 and 005, resp. O'O and 5'0 mag.,
are not in Argelander's " Uranometria Nova," which is supposed to contain all stars
seen by an average eye in Central Europe, cr Tauri was also easily seen to be
double. All this was very promising.

     ' Thinking I might now venture on giving Viucocaya a regular trial, with my

6-inch telescope mounted on an extempore stand, and expecting by this time to meet

my more complete apparatus, I returned thither, arriving on the last day of

Februarj'. I stayed there seventeen days, but almost all that time the weather

was terribly unsettled. The late mornings were, indeed, fairly sunny, but the air
was filled with visible exhalations from the sloppy pampa, which gradually thickened
into dense clouds by shortly after noon ; then came a tremendous thunderstorm, that
lasted until dark. This storm poured down first .showers of hail, and then torrents
of rain that gradually changed into snow as night came on. The nights were
 almost absolutely overcast, but in the morning came a short interval of bright sun-
 shine, as already menti<jned, that rapidly melted the accumulated snow, and so formed

Athe thunder-clouds which broke in the afternoon. few glimpses of stai's in the night

showed good images, and gave hopes of what might be done when the season of
 " tempestades " had passed. I afterwards found that this was the usual character
of the weather from the middle of December until tlie end of March. As a matter
 of fact the last storm of thunder and rain occurred at Viucocaya on March 31.
Tired of inactivity, I descended to Puno, on the western shore of Lake Titicaca, on

March 17. Here 1 remounted my tele.scope at a height of 12,540 feet above the

sea. At first the weather was little better than on the more elevated pampas
 however it gradually cleared up, and I was able to observe in a more or less
regular way with the incomplete apparatus myat disposal. I shortly aftei-wards

 learnt that considerable difficulties had arisen as to the propriety of forwarding the

remaining parts of my instruments to me through the Chilian lines, and it even

 became necessary to refer the matter to the Chilian seat of Government at Santiago.

myEventually every facility was granted, but as a matter of fact I did not receive

 apparatus until .Tune 2.
      ' In the meantime 1 hid kept a kind of running meteorological journal, not tying

myself to regular hours of making tlie readino-s, but noting down the chief facts as

often as practicable. When the moon was in the way I examined the brighter stars

of the southern heavens for duplicily, and was rewarded by the discovery of several

--very close pairs that liad escaped Sir John Herschel and other observers e.g.

Hf:i Muscse and Velorum. On several evenings the definition was almost perfect

with a power of 400. On the finest moonless nights I sketched the Milky Way, and

with a very small direct-vision spectroscope of Dr. Vogel's arrangement I swept

the southeni part of the Milky Way on the plan advocated by Professor Pickering,

and succeeded in finding a few minute planetary nebulfe and several members of a

special class of stars with most remarkable spectra, of which y Argus may be taken

as by far the most remarkable specimen. I feel almost sure that the spectrum of

y Argus viust, have been observed at Melbourne or in India, although I have not

met with a note to that effect.' I think that fully one-half of the light of this star

is concentrated into four lines, three of which are close together in the neighbour-

hood of D, while the other is far away in W.L. 467, and is apparently identical

with a line in the Stephan-Webl) nebula, in the nebula near the north pole of the

ecliptic, and also in G.C., No. 4,964. In the fainter specimens of this class, of

which I found some five or six, the three yellow lines become merged into one, so

that the spectrum apparently consists of two bright lines or bands, very far apart,

and connected merely by a very feeble spectrum somewhat stronger in the middle

--of the space between these lines a spectrum closelj' related to those of the Wolf-

Ilayet stars in the Swan.

     ' Both at Vincocaya and Puno I tried in various ways to get a view of the sun's

--corona or prominences without the spectroscope for instance, by bringmg the top

of a telegraph-pole or the corner of a roof between the eye and the sun. I was

astonished at the small degree of illumination of the atmosphere even in the

immediate neighbourhood of the sun, but still I never could see any certain

indication of the corona. I believe, however, that the experiment is well worth

repeating, especially if photographs are taken even with an ordinary camera in

place of merely trusting to the unaided sight. I also directed the telescope to the

brighter stars and planets in the davtime, but without any special results, except

that the images were somewhat brighter than at the sea-level. I never succeeded

in seeing any other stars or planets except Venus near noonday, but Sirius and

Jupiter were both plainly visiljle with tlie naked eye from a quarter to half an

hour before sunset. Canopus, too, was plainly seen one minute before the sun's

centre attained a zenith distance of 90°. Under fair conditions a Centauri and

Mars might be added to the number of daylight objects, but there the list would

probably end, unless an exceedingly elevated station were selected. I may add

that nearly all the persons that I spoke to on the subject had frequently seen

Venus with the naked eye in the daytime.

' This great transparency is associated with, and probably due in part to, the

extreme dryness of the air. So dry, in fact, is the air that even the most extended

myhygrometrical tables do not suffice to reduce  observations satisfactorily. I can,
--therefore, at present only give the results for a specimen day or two results

calculated by Eegnault's formulte.

fi bulb of excess. On March 31, at 11.18, it indicated 201-5° Falir., and was still
rising. The shade temperature was about G2° Fahr., and the barometer stood at
18-7 in. The fine morning of May 24 gave, at 10.54 a.m., S.R. 191°. Dry

bulb, 60-9°; wet, 48-2°. Barometer, 18-7 in. Tension, 0-232, or 43 %. This great
drynessof the air causes an immense amount of evaporation from the surface of
Lake Titicaca. The 4,400 square miles in area loses about 3 feet in depth, mainly

by evaporation, or about 2^ cubic miles of water, in the months May to December

inclusive. At^the driest season there is always more water running into it than out

myof it. On June 2, as 1 said before, I at last received                    solar spectroscope and the

myremainder of  long-expected instruments. "SN'ishing to give this apparatus the

best possible chance, I immediately returned to Viucocaya, the highest point at my

command, where the pressure of the air was about 1-2 io. less than at Puno. I

did not, however, find the air appreciably clearer ; what little was gained by the
smaU decrease in density was about compensated by a slight dust-haze, resulting

from the action of the regularly recurring afternoon breezes on the sandy pampa. To

my great disappointment several prisms of my old-fashioned Browning solar

spectroscope had been much damaged on the joiu-ney, so that its action on the sun
was much impaired. Tlie chief observed fact was the unmistahable increase of

brightness towards the violet end of the spectrum. This was particularly shown

by the facility with which the solar prominences could be observed in the H-y, or

G'near ' line. The prominences, in fact, could be seen with about equal ease in

any of the four lines Ila, I),, F, or lly ; nor was a large dispersion at all as neces-

sary as at the sea-level. The slit could also be opened ad libitum. The small

spectroscope already spoken of, when used with a bit of cobalt glass, showed quite a

range of lines above great H,. At this station I completed the drawing of the

southern part of the Millvy Way, that I had begun at Puno. I also frequently

viewed the zodiacal light with the small spectroscope, but although that light was so

intense as to be \isible when the moon had passed the first quarter 1 could never
make out the faintest trace of lines in its spectrum. There was nothing more to be

seen than a short continuous spectnun from just before E to a little beyond F.

myThere, for the first time in                           life, 1 saw "the sun-spots by direct projection

of the sun's rays through a small hole into a darkened room without the aid

of any lens whatever. I was astonished what an amount of detail could be made
oiit in this simple way. From Professor Peters, of Clinton, however, I found that

this plan of viewing the solar spots was used fully two and a half centuries ago ; indeed,

a full account thereof is given in Scheiuer's " l!osa Ursina.'' It is strange, indeed,

that not a word of this, as far as I know, is to be found in any of our modern

popular works on astronomy. On talking the matter over witli Lord Crawford

at Dunecht a few days ago, we tried this experiment, I may say at "random,

in one of the domes there, and immediately made out a spot by the help of an

accidental hole in the roof. It will certainly be remarkable if it does not turn out

that the sun-spots have been seen in this way long before the invention of the
telescope. At Vincocaya, too, I again made a number of solar-radiation and other

meteorological observations, of which I give the most striking ones, taken on a

truly characteristic day. I -was most comfortably quartered in the house of the

genialand kind-hearted station-master. Eound this house ran a wooden platform,

on which, at daybreak, a family of goats capered and clattered about in the thin frosty

air. At 6..30 a.m. the sky was inten.sely clear; the temperature, 7-1 Fahr.; the

barometer, 17-4 in. At 7.48, the ,sun having of com-se risen, the thermometer had

risen too, and  showed  18-9°                       the  depression of the  ice-covered  thermometer  was
                                                 ;

3-0°, the tension 0-045 in., and the percentage of humidity was 43^. By 8.5

%these quantities had changed to 5-7° depr., 0-045 in. and 40 ; but the black-

bulb thermometer already registered 107° (corrected), and the goats were actually

basking in an air-temperature of 19-9°, or twelve degrees below the freezing point,

and the fowls feeding ; and now came a rapidly ascending series of sun-temperatures,

130^, 137, ]50i, 164, 169, all within the fifty minutes from 8.10 to 9 A.M.; the

slfy excessively clear, Yenus then about 11" diameter, shining with an intense-

lustre in the dark blue air. At 9.36, when the black bulb was no less than 180°,

the dry bulb was still 29-8°-30°, or 2° below the freezing point. At 1.66 the-
                                                                                      ;

S.R. was 201'6. At 2.25 occurred the strangest combination in my record,

for with the dry bulb at the fairly comfortable range of 45'7'^ the wet bulb showed

3'>6°, or was below the freezing point, and was accordhigly coated with ice, while
the black bulb showed 199-1°, or no less than 13° above 186-1°, the boiling point of
water at Vincocaya. Respecting this same boiling point, perhaps I may )je per-

mitted to add a fact or two. An egg may be fairly lightly boiled in four and a half

minutes, but twenty-four hours' boiling will not suffice to cook dried beans.

During the construction of the railway, digesters were used for cooking this article

of food, which is greatly in vogue in South America ; but now that the digesters are
worn out, beans can no longer be cooked at high altitudes. It is necessary to

lengthen the chimnej's of all the paraffin lamps by some six inches to get a flame

devoid of smoke. It also takes a full hour longer to get up steam in a locomotive

than at tlie sea-level. Of course temperature comes a little into play, but the

Adiminution of air pressure is the main cause of these diSerences.  favourable

chance of passing the lilockade at all occurring unexpectedly, I left Vincocaya on

June 27, and so had a mere glimpse of the sun, &c., at Arequipa on the 29th

Nowand 30th. S.R., 205^° to the very top of tube ; tension, 0-139 in., 19-8 %.

if we consider what is the best height and situation in which to place an obser-

vatory that it might be intended to maintain for a few years, I should recommend

Myan elevation of some 9,000 to 12,000 ft.  own measures go to show that an

increase of height of 150 ft. reduces the night temperature by about 1° Fahr.

Now at 12,500 ft. on theclearnights there is almost alwaysacertainamoiuitoffi'ost,so

that for any greater altitude it is very easy to find the cold to which the observer

would be exposed. It slioidd be noted, too, that the cold is much more unpleasant
to bear in a thin atmosphere than down at the sea-level. In a thin atmosphere,

too, all exertion becomes fatiguing, and in particular that of moving about under
a load of heavy garments. At considerable altitudes, I need hardly say, a given

change of elevation aftects the density of the air by only a comparatively small

--quantity e.g. at Puno, as we have seen, the barometer stands at 18-7, for

12,540 ft. At Vincocaya we have 17-6, for 14,360 ft. At the lower station we

have the potato cultivated in a himdi-ed varieties, along with maize, &c., while

at the upper one all horticulture is utterly impracticable, and barley even only

yields a few green blades. This total change in the vegetable world is due to

a decrease of mean temperature of about 13° Fahr. On the ground, therefore, of

mere comfort and facility of work a station liigher than Puno is not to be recom-
mended for anything like permanent occupation. On the other hand it would be
very valuable if a higher elevation coidd be commanded for a few months in the

more favourable season, say from the beginning of October until the middle
of December. At that season a station 18,500 ft. high might be occupied without

serious inconvenience, and in Peru there would be the advantage of a practically

vertical sun every day. This view is based on the fact that Dr. Falb and a gentle-

man whom I met repeatedly had spent several days on the summit of the Misti

volcano (18,650 ft.) at the season just mentioned. I do not mean to say that the-
top of the Misti would be likely to be a good site, but in the neighbourhood of
Puno, Santa Rosa, or of La Paz, or, in fact, almost anywhere in the neighbourhood
of Lake Titicaca, a verj' favourable spot might be found for such an extra elevated

station.'

       6. Oh some points in Lemstrom's recent Auroral Experiments in
                             Lapland. By J. Rand Capeon.

     The existing sun-spot epoch augurs well for the advent of auroral displays in the
coming winter, while the recent experiments of Prof. Lemstrom in Lapland have
brought this interesting phenomenon prominently before the public mind. The author
does not propose on this occasion to discuss the results of these experiments beyond

pointing out that they can hardly be accepted in their present state as conclusive.

Among the obscure points may be mentioned the want of any actual recorded

measurement of the line considered to be recognised as the ' citron ' auroral line
certain discrepancies which appear on comparing the discharges, or rather collections,
                                                                     --

obtained from two sets of apparatus differing in size, but otherwise similar iu con-
struction, and on contrasting these with the currents registered by the galvano-

meter                          and lastly and most -importantly the  absence of any comparisons of the so-
                            ;

called aurora-line with other spectra, for the purpose of elucidating tlie still obscure

problem of the real nature of the auroral discharge, such discharge having hitherto

proved not to accord with the spectrum of any artitieial electric discharge yet ]n-o-

duced. His object is rather to invite careful watch and look-out at the present time

for auroral displays, in order that, so far as the less favourable conditions of this

climate will permit, some at least of the conclusions arrived at by Prof. LemstriJm

may be tested.

For the purpose it will be necessary for observers to employ

A1. spectroscope of large field and low dispersion, but provided with some

means for measuring the positions of the lines seen.

Osviug to the faint character of the light obtained, the ordinary filar micro-

meter is not applicable, and both bright and dark points or lines, which are some-

times substituted for the micrometer wires, have each a disadvantage.

In fact, the approach of extraneous light (which is generally needed in such cases)

during the primary examination of an auroral spectrum is undesirable.

    On the whole the author thinks the simplest and best form of micrometer is

obtained b}' the expedient of dividing the slit plate longitudinally into two halves,

and making the upper half traverse the lower by a suitable micrometer movement.
    In this way no artificial illumination of the field is resorted to, the citron line,

the brightest of the group, being used to measure the fainter ones, the position of

this in the lower spectrum being previously arrived at and indicated by a dark fixed

point or index.

   A2. galvanometer and pointed collecting apparatus should be employed, which

may follow the lines of Professor Angstrom's apparatus, as recently described in

' Natiu'e,' so far as the circumstances of the locality and its surroundings will

permit.

3. To this latter it would be desirable to add some form of Professor Thom-

son"s quadrant, or portable electrometer, for the examination of the condition of

atmospheric electricity pending the discharges.

4. Some simple form of auroral transit instrument for obtaining heights and

parallaxes of beams and arches, so that another big floating beam may not again

catch observers unprepared, as in November last, and leave them with a good deal

of guess-woili as to altitudes and compass-points.

Lastly, whether the aurora examined be one ranging freely above, or one, so

to speak, held captive by a ' streaming ' apparatus, it is most necessary to obtain

direct comparisons of its spectrum (after first securing as close position-measure-

ments of the lines seen as may be) with other spectra of an appropriate nature. It

is not possible in the short Umits of this paper to indicate the direction of these

comparisons.

As they have so signally fiiiled in result hitherto, a wide field is still open for

experiment ; and if anything like a permanent auroral display can be secured by

the electrician, upon the chemist will then fall the task of finding a spectrum which

will aptly compare with it. If an aurora can be truly brought down to the earth's

habitable surface, unattainable conditions of pressure and temperature can no longer

be set up as excuses for failure, and it should be strange if the spectrum of the

                               Bg Dr. D. BiEREXS de Haan.

    In a Memoir in the Transactions of the Amsterdam Academy of Sciences, 'An

Appendi.x to the Tables of Indefinite Integrals,' ' the author gave the reductiou-
formulte for the general indefinite integrals

and for some others of similar forms; also some that contain the denominator A, A",

A^. He did the same for another dass that had the ii instead of the F.
     For each of these formulae he g-ave the initial integrals for =;j 1, 2, 3, etc.
     From these integrals, again, he deduced some other general ones with the factors

F"^, E', EF\ also with the initial cases.

     Ill obtaiiiing these reductions it was for some initial values necessary to admit
certain new transcendents.

    Now from the last-mentioned integrals, it is sometimes possible to eliminate

these transcendents, and so obtain some new results, viz.

      In order to obtain the general reduction-formula? for these last results, it is neces-

sary to put P + -2 for p in the theorems Ixxiii., Ixxv., Ixxv.", Ixxvii. ; to multiply
with 2, and take the difference between this result and the original one. Then by

consecutively substituting the relation 2 sin'+-' .r = sin'- .r(l -cos 2.r), it follows

8. On tie probable Explanation of the Effect of Oil in Calming Waves
                      in a Storm. By E. P. Culverwell.

    When the sm-face of the sea has become quite smooth after a storm, it is veiy

common for long rollers to break on a sand bar. If there be no wind and the sea

be glassy, these will not break until quite close to the shore, even though the ordi-

nary theory points to their breaking earlier, unless a force directed in the opposite

direction to that of their motion be exerted on the wave. Such a force mio-lit be

supplied by the wind                                                                                                     Ijut if it rise  in  any direction                       the -waves break much sooner.
                                                                                                                      ;

This effect is therefore due to some secondary effect produced by the wind's pres-

sure, and not  directly                                                                                                  by  the    pressure                         :"  and  it     is to  the  ripples produced on

                                                                                                                                              itself

the surface (which disturb the wave motion), that the speedy breaking is to be

attributed. It is, however, a direct result of theory that the ripples depend on

surface tension for then- propagation, and cannot exist in large amount on the oiled

surface. It is also evident that the hold of the wind on the wave is trreatly de-

creased by the absence of ripples, and thus the oil acts both to prevent the wind

having much effect on the surface, and also to prevent the motion of the water in

the wave itself being such as to cause breaking. The amount of friction may per-

haps sensibly influence the breaking, but definite experiments on this are stiU

wanting.

 9. On the Pressure of the Vapour of Mercury at the Ordinary Temperature.
                             By Professor McLeod, F.R.S.

    At tlie last meeting of the Association Lord Eayleigh called attention to a paper

that had appeared in the ' Annalen der Physik und Chemie ' (N. F. xvi. 610), by

Hagen, on the Pressure of Saturated Mercui-y Vapour at Low Temperatures. The

pressures given for the ordinary atmospheric temperatures, although considerably
less than those published by Ptegnault, appeared rather higher than some recent
observations seemed to warrant.

   A method of determining the vapour pressure at ordinary temperatures seems to

have occurred to Mr. Crookes and the author almost simultaneously, and he much

regrets that the absence of the former from the present meeting prevents the Asso-
ciation learning the results of his work. Mr. Crookes intended to trv the experi-
ment in vacuo, whereas the author thought of saturating air with mercury vapour
but both intended to determine the quantity of evaporated mercury by a chemical
          --

444 REPORT-- 1883.

     A. glass flask of about TO litres capacity was emploj'ed for the experiment, and

%within it was supported, a piece of string-, a glass tube 14 mm. in diameter, and

tilled with freshly distilled mercury, the fiaslc being closed by a greased gl-.iss plate.
After standing at tlie temperature of the laboratory for about nine days, the mei-
cury tube was removed and a small quantity of boiling nitric acid poured into the
(flask and left to stand for some time. Tlie acid was next neutralised bv ammonia,
.and aftertlie fumes in the flask bad disappeared, the liquid was washed out with
-water, acidulated with hydrochloric acid, and treated with sulphuretted hydrogen.

A slight brown colouration resulted. Several standard solutions of mercury were

then made and tested with sulphuretted hydrogen in the same numner.' The
liquid from the flask gave a deeper colour than the solution containing -00006 grms.

-fore be assumed that the flask contained about -00000 grms. of mercury yapour.

     Subsequently tlie same flask was used and a tube of mercury 24 mm. "in diameter
(or exposing nearly three times as much mercury surface as the first), suspended in

it and allowed to stand for a month. Treated in a similar manner tiie colour was
nearly the same (a little lighter if auytliing) as that produced by a solution con-
taining -00012 grms. of mercury. Oue litre of the air in the llas'k. tlierefore, con-

mercury vapour at 20° C, and the normal pressure is S-3474 grms.'^ the volume of
the vapour in 1 litre of the air was =·'-*'-^'-i|-'s'f^ji222 -007560 cubic centimetres or

     It may be observed that this method miglit have been expected to give rather

an excess than a defect of the quantity of mercury, in consequence of condensation
of mercury on the sides of the flask, and although the experiment was of a some-
·what rough character, it seems to show that Ilagen's number is too high.

    A paper has also been published by Hertz (Ann. Plujs. u. Chem'., N. F. xvii.

10. On, theJmperfectinn of the Galvanometer as a Test of the Evanescence
         of a Transient Current. Bij Prcfessor Lord ItAYLEiGU, F.B.S.

      In. certain electrical measurements a galvanometer is used to indicate whether
·or not the integral value of a current of short duration is zero. For example, in
the method given in ^lax well's ' Electricity,' §755, for comparing the coefficients of
miitual induction, .M, of two pairs of coils, the evanescence of the integral current
^through the galvanometer is made the test of the fulfilment of a certain relation
between the coefficients of induction and the resistances. The two primary coils
are joined up iu simple circuit with a battery. The two secondaries are also con-

nected together in such a way that tlie inductive electro-motive forces conspire,
and two points, P, Q,, one on each connector, are brought into contact with the

galvanometer terminals. In special cases, as for instance when' the two pairs of

coils are similar, there is no current through the galvanometer, whatever may

happen iu the primaiy circuit ; but iu general the establishment or interruption of
 the piimnry current will cause a deflection of the galvanometer indicative of the

integral value of the current passing. The method consists in adding inductionless-

resistance coils to one or other of the secondaries until this cunent vanishes.
      The required conditions are most readily obtained by supposing the galvano-

Emeter circuit broken, and inquiring into tlie value of the electro-motive force
between the points P and Q. The same current y flows iu both secondaries, and if

,r be the primary current, the equations are

\U'(It

Mj, M.,, are the inductiou coeiBcients to he compared ; R, S, tlie resistances of
the two secondaries (with associated resistance coils); N,, N.,, their coefficients
of self-inductiow. Thus

                (M, + M,) E = (M,N, - MjN,)^! + (M^R - Mfi) y.

     Since y begins from  and ends at 0, the integral electro-motive force vanishes-
if--
                                   M,,R-MiS = 0.

If this condition is satisfied, there is no integral cm'rent through the galvanometer,-

and then the ratio of induction coefficients is known by the ratio of resistances.
     In general, however, the evanescence of the integral current is obtained by the

opposition of consecutive positive and negative parts, and even although the whole
duration of the effect be but a small fraction of the time of vibration, the needle of
the galvanometer will be disturbed in such a manner as to make it difficult to say
whether or not the whole impulse acting upon it be zero. To obtain a satisfactory
measurement it is necessary to secm-e at least an approximate fulfilment of the

second condition required in order that the current may be zero throughout, viz.

In this there is no difficulty, as we can easily increase the defective self-induction

by the addition of other coils, placed at a sufficient distance. The most convenient

plan is to include two coils by the variation of the relative situation of which the

self-induction can be adjusted. With moderate care the initial impulsive electro-

motive force, caused by a sudden variation of the primary current, and dependent

only upon the induction coefficients, may be made so small that the needle shows

no uneasiness when the other adjustment relative to the resistances is complete.

In March 1881 I attempted, in conjunction witli Messrs. Glazebrook and

Dodds, to carry out the plan above suggested for the comparison of two co-

efficients of mutual induction. No satisfactoiy result could be obtained in tlie

ordinary method of working, the needle showing uneasiness whatever resistances

were employed, so that it was impossible to fix upon any particular value as

corresponding to a zero integi-al current. The addition of other coils to increase

the self-induction of one of the secondaries was so far successful that the needle

could be reduced to quietness, but calculation showed that the additional self-

induction found to be necessary in experiment was mucli in excess of what the

above theory would indicate. The explanation which afterwards suggested itself
to me was that the anomalous effect was due to the conducting rings upon which

some of the coils were wound, and whose presence complicates the otherwise simple
Wetheory.
           verified this view by bringing a coil of wire into the neighbourhood

of one of the principal coils, the behaviour of the galvanometer needle being very

sensibly different according as the auxiliary coil was open or closed.

The kind of embarrassment to which measurements of this kind are subject is

well illustrated by placing the galvanometer in a tertiary circuit, not directly

Ainfluenced at all by the battery current in the primary.  pair of coils with

double wres, such as are often used for large electro-magnets, is suitable for the

experiment. One wire of the first coil is connected with the battery, and forms

the primary circuit. The second wire of the first coil and the first wire of the

second coil are connected, and constitute together the secondary circuit. The

second wire of the second coil and the galvanometer form the tertiary circuit. The

apparatus must be so adjusted that no eflect is perceived at the galvanometer when

the secondary is broken, whatever may happen in the primary. When this ad-

justment is complete the secondary is closed, and the effect is observed of opening

or closing the primary. If the contacts are properly made, the integral currenl;

through the galvanometer at each operation is rigorously zero, but in the experi-

ments that 1 have made no one could infer the fact from the behaviour of the-
galvanometer needle. The effect may be exaggerated by the insertion of a few iron

wires into the induction coils.

11. On the Adjustment of Numerical Results derived from Observation.
                                 By T. B. Sprague.

     The autlioi- described the method he has employed in various investigations to
obtain well-graduated tables from the data furnished by observations made on

various bodies of lives. Among these may be specified investigations into the rate
of mortality among recently selected lives, and into the rate of re-marriage among

widowers, both of which are contained in the 'Journal of the Institute of Actuaries'

(Laytons, London). However large the luuuber of lives observed may be, the pro-

babilities of marriage, death, &c. obtained for successive ages, never proceed with

sufficient regularity ; and it is always necessary to make use of some process of ad-

iustment, in order to substitute for the observed series of ratios, a more regular one.
The most satisfactory method, if practicable, would be to take a mathematical
formula representing the law of progression, and to determine the values of the
constants in it by means of the method of least squares. But even when we assume
that the rate of death (or marriage) depends only on the age, it is not possible to
obtain a formula that is suitable for all ages. Still more difficult would it be to
find suitable formulas for the cases where the law depends on otlier circumstances
besides age ; thus, for instance, the rate of mortality among insured lives depends
on the length of time that has elapsed since they were admitted ; and the rate of

marriage among widowers, depends not so much on their age, as on the length of
time since they became widowers. Nothing has ever been done in the way of
suggesting formulas to represent the rates of mortalitj^ and marriage in such cases.

     In the absence of suitable formulas, some other method has to be adopted. One

that has been very popular is the substitution for the irregular series of ratios given
by observation, of a series deduced from it by a system of averages : for instance,

instead of p.,, we may substitute i(^,_i +;^,.+,), or ^(;>,-_, +;; +i?,,+i), or
4\{p,^i + 2p,,+p,,+\). In practice many more terms are employed in calculating

the average, say lo. This method lessens the irregularities of the original series,
but does not get rid of them altogether. It is therefore not possible by the use of

this method, whatever may be the particular formula employed, to get an

adjusted series that proceeds with entire regularity. But there is a more serious

objection to the method, namely, that it has a tendency to distort the law of the
original figures, and to remo^-e features of the progression that ought to be retained.

If we suppose the method applied to a perfectly regular series, it should, if it is a
theoretically correct method, leave the series unaltered. But it is easy to see that

the series will be altered unless it follows a certain law, which is determined by

solving the equation of difterences,

^p,+=?),.  (5 p^_i + ;).,+,) +C(^.,_2+i>,-i-2)+  ....

obtained by equating the adjusted value, given by the formula, to the original value.
If the series follows the law thus found, the method will leave it unaltered, but it
will alter a series following any other law ; and repeated application of the method
would still further distort the law. For these reasons the method seems quite

unsuitable for general adoption, if indeed it is ever thoroughly suitable.

     The author has therefore employed a graphical method. Taking the age as the

abscissa, the unadjusted ratios derived from the original observations are plotted

down on a sheet of cross-ruled paper as ordinates. When this has been done care-

fully, it is always found that, notwithstanding the irregularities in the progression,
which are sometimes very gi'eat, the general law of the progression becomes obvious,

.loiuing the ends of successive ordinates, we get a broken line, the general course
of which indicates the law, and we have then to substitute for this broken line a
smooth curve which, on the whole, follows the same course. This smooth curve
is drawn, either by hand, or by some mechanical means, such as the use of the
* French curves ' sold by mathematical instrument makers ; and the ordinates being

read off", measured, or estimated, according to circumstances, give an adjusted series
of figures. This has then to be tested by comparison with the original observa-
tions. The adjusted probability of death or marriage, &c. at each age, is multiplied
into the number of lives under observation at that age, so as to get the calculated
            TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.  447

number of deaths, marriages, &c. at every age. These are then added together and

compared with the observed numbers of deaths, marriages, &c., and the deviations

are noted.  These indicate where our curve requires correction for instance, they
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

may indicate that for a certain range of ages, the ordinates require to be increased

5 per cent., and for other ages to be diminished 3 per cent. The corrections thus

indicated are applied to the ciu've, and a fresh curve is drawn which will give

effect to them as far as is possible without introducing irregularities. The ordi-

nates of this second curve are then read off, and compared as before with the

original observations, and the process repeated as often as may be found necessary.

                12. On the Action of Currents of Air between Plates,
                                By Philip BRAHAii, F.G.8.

    On investigating the cause of what is known as Faraday's experiment on the

aspirating power of currents of air, I contrived an apparatus consisting of two
metal plates 5 cm. diameter, to one of which a tube 4 mm. diameter is attached,
and to the other a tube with a hole '1 mm. The plates can be adjusted parallel to
each other at any required distance, and also the plate with the small hole is
movable parallel to its plane, the distance between centres of plates being

measurable.

   A current of air at constant pressure is forced lietween the plates from the larger

tube, the smaller tube being connected with a pressure gauge.

    A series of experiments ( illustrated by curves submitted) showed that there are

certain points at which the resultant vacuum area is greater than pressure, and
others at which pressure is greater, showing that the phenomenon is due to a series
of vibrations which are further apparent when higher pressure is employed.

             A13, new Reflector for Incandescent Electric Lamps.

                          By Professor Frank Clowes, D.Sc.

     Recent experiments have proved the practicability of a method recently proposed
for securing complete or partial forward reflexion in any direction of the light
emitted from the back of the incandescent filament of the lamp. The idea was

conceived of attaching a metallic film to the exterior of the glass globe, this film

being applied in any desired part, so as to secure reflexion from any portion of the
surface, and also, if necessary, in so thm a form as to allow a certain amount of light
to be transmitted, and a portion only reflected.

     The films experimented upon thus far have been silver films deposited from an
ammoniacal solution of silver tartrate. It has been found easy to produce these of
any desired opacity by varying the strength of the solution ; they have usually been
protected from injury by coating them with tarnish. Direct photometric measure-
ment shows that a Swan lamp, after being silvered over half its surface, throws
forward practically twice as much light as it did before being thus prepared. The
skeleton-like appearance of the luminous filament is also removed by this method

of reflexion.

     The preliminary experiments thus far made seem to indicate that this method
of applying the metallic film is cheap and easy, and there are manifest advantages
in employing a metal with such high reflecting power as silver.

     There are many applications of the lamp for which the reflector suggests itself;

for the writing-table, billiard-table, and frequently for general illumination of rooms
from wall-brackets, the opaque film seems appropriate, whilst in other cases a par-
tially transparent film causes the larger part of the light to be thrown forward,
whilst enough light is transmitted to suflSciently illuminate the space behind the
lamp.

    The convenience of having the reflector upon the lamp itself, and therefore
requiring no separate attachment or support, will be evident.

    President of the Section--J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.R.S., V.P.C.S.

                         THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 20.

    The PPvEsident delivered the following Address :

A SECTIONAL address usually consists either of a review of the work done in the

particular science during the past year, or of an exposition of some hranch of

that science to which the speaker has given more especial attention. I propose to
myfollow tlie latter of these practices, and shall ask the indulgence of
                                                                          brother

chemists while I endeavour to place before them some thoughts on the subject of

Elements.

     Thouo-h theoretical and practical chemistry are now intertwined, with manifest

advantage to each, they appear to have been far apart in their origin. Practical
chemistry arose from the arts of life, the knowledge empirically and laboriously

acquired by the miner and metallurgist, the potter and the glass-worker, the cook
and the perfumer. Theoretical chemistry derived its origin from cosmogony. In

the childhood of the human race the question was eagerly put, ' By what process

were all things made ? ' and some of the answei'S given started the doctrine of
elements. The earliest documentary evidence of tlie idea is probably contained in

to the Great Yu, to teach him his royal duty and ' the proper virtues of the

various relations.' Of course there are wide difl'erences of opinion as to its date,

but we can scarcely be wrong in considering it as older than Solomons writings.

The First Division of the Great Plan relates to the Five Elements. ' The first is

named Water; the second, Fire; the third, "Wood; the fourth. Metal; the fifth.

Earth. The nature of water is to soak and de.'^cend ; of fire, to blaze and ascend

of  wood, to be crooked  and to be straight ;  of metal, to obey and to change                                                                                                                                               while
                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

the virtue of the earth is seen in seed-sowing and ingathering. That which soaks

and descends becomes salt; that whicli blazes and ascends becomes bitter; that

which is crooked and straight becomes sour ; that which obeys and changes

becomes acrid ; and from seed-sowing and ingathering comes sweetness.' i_

   A similar idea of five elements was also common among the Indian races,

and is stated by Mr. Rodwell to have been in existence before the fifteenth

century B.C., bixt, though the number is the same, the elements themselves are not

identical with those of the ancient Chinese classic ; thus, in the Institutes of Menu,

the ' subtle ether ' is spoken of as being the first created, from which, by trans-

mutation, springs air, whence, by the operation of a change, rises light or fire

from this comes water, and from water is deposited earth. These five are curiously

correlated with the five senses, and it is very evident tliat they are not looked upon

as five independent material existences, but as derived from one another. This
philosophy was accepted alike by Hindoos and Buddhists. It was largely extended

     > Quoted from the translation by the Eev. Dr. Legge. In that most obscure
classic, the Ti-Kinff, fire and water, wind and thunder, the ocean and the mountains,

appear to be recognised as the elements.

over Asia, and found its way into Europe. It is best known to us in the writings

--of the Greeks. Among these people, however, the elements were reduced to four

 fire, air, earth, and water though Aristotle endeavoured to restore the 'blue
ether ' to its position as the most subtle and divine of them all. It is true that the
 fifth element, or ' quinta essentia,' was frequently spoken of by the early chemists,
 though the idea attaching to it was somewhat changed, and the four elements con-

tinued to retain their place in popular apprehension, and still retain it even among
many of the scholars who take degrees at our universities. The claim of wood to be

 considered an element seems never to have been recognised in the West, unless,

indeed, we are to seek this origin for the choice of the word vXrj to signify that

 original chaotic material out of which, according to Plato and his school, all things
were created.* The idea also of a primal element, from which the others, and

everything else, were originated, was common in Greece, the difficulty being to decide
which of the fom- had the greatest claim to this honour. Thales, as is well known,
in the sixth century B.C. affirmed that water was the first principle of things ; but
Anaximenes afterwards looked upon air, and Herakleitos upon fire as the primal

element, while Pherekydes regarded the earth as the great ancestor. This notion
of elements, however, was essentially distinct from our own. It was always

associated with the idea of the genesis of matter rather than with its idtimate
analysis, and the idea of simple as contrasted with compound bodies probably never

entered into the thoughts of the contending philosophers.

     The modern idea appears to have had a totally different origin, and we must

again travel back to China. There, also in the sixth century B.C., the great
philosopher Lao-tse was meditating on the mysteries of the world and the soul,
and his disciples founded the rehgion of Taou. They wei-e materialists ; neverthe-

less they believed in a ' finer essence,' or spirit, that rises from matter, and may

become a star ; thus they held that the souls of the five elements, water, metal,
fire, wood, and earth, arose and became the five planets. These speculations
naturally led to a search after the sublimated essences of things, and the means by
which this immortality might be secured. It seems that at the time of Tsin-she-

hwang, the builder of the Great AVall, about two centuries before Christ, many
romantic stories were current of immortal men inhabiting islands in the Pacific
Ocean. It was supposed that in these magical islands was found the ' herb of
immortality ' growing, and that it gave them exemption from the lot of common
mortals. The emperor determined to go in search of these islands, but some unto-

ward event always prevented him.'-
     Some two or three centuries after this a Taouist, named "VVeipahyang, wrote a

remarkable book called ' The Uniting Bond.' It contains a great deal about the
changes of the heavenly bodies, and the mutual relation of Heaven and men ; and
then the author proceeds to explain some transformations of silver and water.

About elixir he tells us, ' What is white when first obtained becomes red after

manipulation on being formed into the elixir' ('tan,' meaning red or elixir).
* That substance, an inch in diameter, consists of the black and the white, that is,
water and metal combined. It is older than heaven and earth. It is most
honourable and excellent. Around it, like a wall, are the sides of the cauldron.
It is closed up and sealed on every side, and carefully watched. The thoughts
must be undisturbed, and the temper calm, and the hoiu^ of its perfection anxiously

waited for. The false chemist passes through various operations in vain. He who

is enlightened expels his evil passions, is delighted morning and night, forgets fame

He cannot then he scorched hy fire, nor drowned in water, &c. &c. . . , The

cauldron is round like the full moon, and the stove beneath is shaped like the half-

moon. The lead ore is symbolised by the White Tiger ; and it, like metal amongst

the elements, belongs to the West. Mercury resembles the sun, and forms itself

into sparkling globes; it is symbolised by the Blue Dragon belonging to the

East, and it is assigned to the element wood. Gold is imperishable. Fire does not

injure its lustre. Like the sim and moon, it is unaffected by time. Therefore the

elixir is called " the Golden Elixir." Life can be lengthened by eating the herb

called Hu ma ; how much more by taking the elixir, which is the essence of gold,

the most imperishable of all things ! The influence of the elixir, when partaken

of, will extend to the four limbs; the countenance will become joyful ; white hair

will be tiu-ned black ; new teeth will grow in the place of old ones, and age at

once become youth. . . . Lead ore and mercury are the bases of the process

     This description suggests the idea that the elixir of the Taouists was the red

-- --sidphide of mercury vermilion for the preparation of which the Chinese are still

famous. That Weipahyang believed in his own philosophy is testified by a writer

named Ko-hung, who, about a century afterwards, wrote the lives of celebrated

Taouists. He teUs how the philosopher, after preparing the elixir, took it, with his

disciples, into a wood, and gave it first to his dog, then took it himself, and was

followed by one of his pupils. They all three died, but, it appears, rose to life

again, and to immortality.  This brilliant example did not remain without imitators
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

indeed, two emperors of the Tang family are said to have died from partaking of

the elixir. This circumstance diminished its popularity, and alchemy ceased to be

practised in the Celestial Empire.

    At the beginning of the seventh century the doctrine of Lao-tse was in great
favour at the Chinese Court ; learning was encouraged, and there was much

enterprise. At the same time the disciples of Mahomed carried their arms and his

doctrines over a large portion of Asia, and even to the Flowery Land. Throughout

the eighth century there were frequent embassies between eastern and western Asia,

Wewars with the Caliphs, and even a matrimonial alliance.                                                  need not wonder,

therefore, that the teachings of the Taouist alchemists penetrated westward to the

Arabian philosophers. It was at this period that Yeber-Abou-lMoussah-Djafer

al-Sofe, commonly caUed Geber, a Sabaean of great knowledge, started what to the

West was a new philosophy about the transmutation of metals, the Philosopher's

Stone, and the Elixir of Life ; and this teaching was couched in highly poetic

language, mixed with astrology and accompanied by religious directions and rites.

He held that all metals were composed of mercury, sulphui", and arsenic, in various

proportions, and that the noblest metal could be procured only by a very lengthy

purification. It was in the salts of gold and silver that he looked for the Universal

Medicine. Geber himself was an experimental philosopher, and the belief in

transmutation led to the acquirement of a considerable amount of chemical

knowledge amongst the alchemists of Arabia and Europe. This gradually brought

about a conviction that the three reputed elementary bodies, mercury, sidphur, and

salt or acid, were not really the originators of all things. There was a transition
period, during which the notion was itself suffering a transmutation. The idea

became gradually clearer that all material bodies were made up of certain

constituents, which could not be decomposed any further, and which, therefore,

should be considered as elementary. The introduction of quantitative methods

compelled the overthrow of mediaeval chemistry, and led to the placing of the

conception of simple and compoimd bodies upon the foundation of scientific fact.

Lavoisier, perhaps, deserves the greatest credit in this matter, while the labours

of the other great cliemists of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth

centuries were in a great measure directed to the analysis of every conceivable

material, whether solid, liquid, or gaseous. These have resulted in the table of so-

called elements, now nearly seventy in number, to which fresh additions are con-

stantly being made.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  451

       Of this ever-growing list of elements not one has been resolved into simpler
 bodies for three-quarters of a century ; and we, who are removed by two or three
 generations from the gi-eat builders of our science, are tempted to look upon these

 bodies as thouo^h they were really simple forms of matter, not only imresolved,

 but unresolvable. The notation we employ favours this view and stamps it upon

  our minds.

       Is it, however, a fact that these reputed elements are really simple bodies ? or,

 indeed, are they widely different in the nature of their constitution from those bodies

 which we know to be chemical compounds ? Thus, to take a particidar instance,

 are fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine essentially distinct in their nature from
 the compound halogens, cyanogen, sulphocyanogen, ferricyanogen, &c. ? Are the
 metals lithium, sodium, and potassium essentially distinct from such alkaline bases

 as ammonium, ethylamine, di-ethylamine, &c. ? No philosophical chemist would

 probably venture to answer this question categorically with either ' yes ' or ' no.'

--Let us endeavour to approach it from three different points of attack (1) the

 evidence of the spectroscope, (2) certain peculiarities of the atomic weights, and

--(3) specific refraction.
      1. The Spectroscope. It was at first hoped that the spectroscope might throw
 much light upon the nature of elements, and might reveal a common constituent in
 two or more of them ; thus, for instance, it was conceivable that the spectrum lines

 of bromine or iodine vapour might consist of the rays given by chlorine plus some

others. All expectations of this have hitherto been disappointed : wliat we do
frequently find is a certain similarity of character among the spectra of analogous

elements, not rays of identically the same refrangibility. Yet, on the other hand,
it must not be supposed that such a negative result disproves the compound nature
 of elements, for as investigation proceeds it becomes more and more clear that the
 spectrum of a compound is not made iip of the spectra of its component parts.

     Again, the multiplicity of rays given out by some elements, when heated, in

 a gaseous condition, such us iron, has been supposed to indicate a more complex

constitution than in the case of those metals, such as magnesium, which give a

more simple spectrum. Yet it is perfectly conceivable that this may be due to a

complexity of arrangement of atoms all of the same kind.

     Again, we have changes of a spectrum at different temperatures ; new rays

 appear, others disappear ; or even there occiu's the very remarkable change from a
fluted spectrum to one of sharp lines at irregular intervals, or to certain recurrino-

groups of lines. This, in all probability, does arise from some redistribution, but

it may be a redistribution in a molecular grouping of atoms of the same kind, and

not a dissociation or rearrangement of dissimilar atoms.

    A stronger argument has been derived from the revelations of the spectroscope

in regard to the luminous atmospheres of the sun. There we can watch the effect
of heat enormously transcending that of our hottest furnaces, and of movements

compared with which our hurricanes and whii'lwinds are the gentlest of zephyrs.
Mr. Locljyer, in studying the prismatic spectra of the luminous prominences or
spots of the sun, has frequently observed that on certain days certains lines, say of
the iron spectrum, are non-existent, and on other days certain other lines disappear,
and that in almost endless variety ; and he has also remarked that occasionally cer-

tain lines of the iron spectrum will he crooked or displaced, thus showing the
vapour to be in very rapid motion, while otliers are straight, and therefore com-

paratively at rest. Now, as a gas cannot be both at rest and in motion at the same
time and the same place, it seems very clear that the two sets of lines must originate
in two distinct layers of atmosphere, one above the other, and Mr. Lockyer's con-
clusion is that the u-on molecule was dissociated by heat, and that its different
constituents, on account of their different volatility, or some other cause, had
floated away from one another. This seems to me the easiest explanation of the
phenomenon ; and, as dissociation by heat is a very common occurrence, there
is no a priori improbability about it. But we are not shut up to it, for the

different layers of atmosphere are certainly at different temperatures, and most
probably of different composition. If they are of different temperatures the

variations of the spectrum may only be an extreme case of what must be acknow-
                                                     GG2

--ledged to be a fact by everjoue more or less that bodies emit, or cease to emit,

different rays as their temperature increases, and notably when they pass from the
liquid to the gaseous condition. And again, if the composition of the two layers of

atmosphere be different, we have lately learnt how profoundly the admixture of a

--foreign substance will sometimes modify a luminous spectrum.
    2. Peculiarities of Atomic Weights. At the meeting of this Association at
Ipswich, in 1851, M. Dumas showed that in several cases analogous elements form

groups of three, the middle one of which has an atomic weight intermediate between

those of the first and third, and that many of its physical and chemical properties

are intermediate also. During the discussion upon his paper, and subsequently,*

attention was drawn to tlie fact that this is not confined to groups of three, but

that there exist many series of analogous elements having atomic weights which

differ by certain increments, and that these increments are in most cases multiples

of 8. Thus we have lithium, 7; sodium, 23, z.e. 7 + 16; potassium, 39, «.e. 7 + (16 x 2);
and the more recently discovered rubidium, 85, i.e. 7 + (16 x 5) nearly ; and cffisium,
133, i.e. 7 + (16 x 8) nearly. This is closely analogous to what we find in organic

chemistry, where there are series of analogous bodies playing the part of metals,

such as hydrogen, methyl, ethyl. Sec, differing by an increment which has the

atomic weight 14, and which we know to be CH,,. Again, there are elements with

atomic weights nearly the same or nearly multiples of one another, instances of

which are to be found in the great platinum group and the great cerium group.*

This suggests the analogy of isomeric and polymeric bodies. There is also this re-

markable circumstance : the various members of such a group as either of those just

mentioned are found together at certain spots on the surface of the globe, and

scarcely anywhere else. The chemist may be reminded of how in the dry distilla-

tion of some organic body he has obtained a mixture of polymerised hydrocarbons,

and may perhaps be excused if he speculates whether in the process of formation of

the platinum or the cerium group, however and whenever it took place, the different

elements had been made from one another and imperfectly polymerised.

But this is not the largest generalisation in regard to the peculiarities of these

atomic weights. Newlands showed that, by arranging the numbers in their order,

the octaves presented remarkable similarities, and, on the same principle, Mendelejeft

constructed his well-known table. I may remind you that in this table the atomic

weights are arranged in horizontal and vertical series, those in the vertical series dif-

--fering from one another, as a rule, by the before-mentioned midtiples of 8 namely 16,

--16, 24, 24, 24, 24, 32, 32 the elements being generally analogous in their atomicity

and in other chemical characters. Attached to the elements are figures, represent-

ing various phj-sical properties, and these in the horizontal series appear as periodic

functions of the atomic weights. The table is incomplete, especially in its lower

portions, but, with all its imperfections and irregularities, there can be no doubt that

it expresses a great truth of nature. Now, if we were to interpolate the compound
-- --bodies which act hke elements
methyl,  15              ammonium,  18 ;  cyanogen,                   26  into
                      ;

Mendelejefl"'s table, they would be utterly out of place, and would upset the order

both of chemical analogy and of the periodicity of the physical properties.

   --3. Specific Refraction. The specific refraction has been determined for a large

majority of the elements, and is a very fundamental property, which belongs to

them apparently in all their combinations, so long at least as the atomicity ^ is

unchanged. If the figures representing this property be inserted into Mendelejeft''s

table, we find that in the vertical columns the figures almost invariably decrease

as the atomic weights increase. If, however, we look along the horizontal columns,

or better still if we plot the figures in the table by which Lothar Meyer has shown

graphically that the molecular volume is a periodic function of the atomic weights,

    ' PHI. Mag., May 185.S.

     ^ Another curious instance is the occurrence of nickel and cobalt in all meteoric
irons, with occasionally chromium or manganese, the atomic weights and otlier
properties of which are very similar.

     ' This exception includes not merely such changes as that from a ferrous to a
ferric salt, but the different ways in which the carbon is combined in such bodies as
ethene, benzene, and pyrene.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  453

we shall see that they arrange themselves in a series of curves similar to but not at
all coincident with his. The observations are not so complete or accurate as those of

the molecular volumes, but they seem sufficient to establish the fact, while the
points of the curves would appear to be, not the alkaline metals, as in Meyer's
diagram, but hydrogen, phosphorus and sulphur, titanium and vanadium, selenium,

antimony. Now, if we were to insert the specific refractions of cyanogen, ammo-
nium, and methyl into this table, we should again show that it was an intrusion
of strangers not in harmony with the family of elements.

     But there is another argument to he derived from the action of light. The
refraction equivalent of a compound body is the sum of the refraction equivalents
of its compounds; and, if there is anything known for certain in the whole
subject, it is that the refraction equivalent of an organic compound advances by
the same quantity (7"6) for every increment of CHo. If, therefore, the increment
between the different members of a group of analogous elements, such as the
alkaline metals, be of the same character, we may expect to find that there is a
regular increase of the refraction equivalent for each addition of 16. But this is
utterly at variance with fact : thus, in the instance above quoted, the refraction
equivalent of lithium being 3'8, that of sodium is 4'8, of potassium 8'1, of rubidium
14'0, and of csesiimi about 13-7. Neither does the law obtain in those series in
which the increment is not a multiple of 8, as in the case of the halogens, where
the increment of atomic weight is 45, and the refraction equivalents are chlorine O'O,
bromine 15'3, and iodine 24-5.

     The refraction equivalents of isomeric hodies are generally identical ; and the

refraction equivalents of polymeric bodies are in proportion to their atomic weights.

Among the groups of analogous elements of the same, or nearly the same, atomic
weight we do find certain analogies: thus cobalt and nickel are respectively

lO'S and 10'4, while iron and manganese are respectively 12'0 and 12'2. But, as

far as observation has gone at present, we have reason to conclude that, if metals

stand to one another in the ratio of 2 : 1 in atomic weight, their refraction equiva-

lents are much nearer together than that; while, on the other hand, the equivalent

of sulphui-, instead of being the double of that of oxygen, is at least five times as

great.

     The general tendency of these arguments is evidently to show that the elementary
radicals are essentially different from the compound radicals, though their chemical

functions are similar.

     There remains still the hypothesis that there is a ' primordial element,' from

which the others are derived by transmutation. With the sages of Asia it was the
* blue ether,' with Thales water, with Dr. Prout hydrogen. The earlier views

have passed away, and the claims of hydrogen are being fought out by some of
our ablest analysts on the battlefield of atomic weights and their rigorous deter-

mination.

     There does not appear to be any argument which is fatal to the idea that two

or more of our supposed elements may differ from one another rather in form than

in substance, or even that the whole seventy are only modifications of a prime
element ; but chemical analogies seem wanting. The closest analogy would be if

we could prepare two allotropic conditions of some body, such as phosphorus or

cyanogen, which should carry their allotropism into all their respective compounds,
no compound of the one form being capable of change into a compound of the other.
Our present knowledge of allotropism, and of variations in atomicity, aftbrds little,
if any, promise of this.

     The remarkable relations between the atomic weights of the elements, and
many peculiarities of their grouping, force upon us the conviction that they are not
separate bodies created without reference to one another, but that they have been
originally fashioned, or have been built up from one another, according to some

general plan. This plan we may hope gradually to imderstand better; but if we

are ever to transform one of these supposed elements into another, or to split up
one of them into two or three dissimilar forms of matter, it will probably be by
the application of some method of analysis hitherto unknown.

    Nothing can be of greater promise than the discovery of new methods of

researcli ; hence I need make no apology to others who have lately done excellent
work in chemistry if I single out the Bakerian Lecture of this year, by Mr.

Crookes, on ' Eadiant Matter Spectroscopy.' It relates to the prismatic analysis,

not of the light transmitted or absorbed in the ordinary way by a solid or liquid,

nor of that given out by incandescent gas, but the analysis of the fluorescence that
manifests itself in certain bodies when they are exposed to an electric discharge in

a highly exhausted vacuum. He describes, in an interesting and even amusmg

manner, his three years' quest after the origin of a certain citron band, which he

observed in the spectrum of the fluorescence of many substances, till he was led

into that wonderful labyrinth of uncertain elements which are foimd together in

samarskite, and eventually he proved the appearance to be due to yttrium. As the

test is an extremely delicate one, he has obtained evidence of the very general dis-

--semination of that element, in very minute quantities and not always very minute,

for the polypes that built up a certain pink coral were evidently able to separate

the earth from the sea water, as their calcareous secretion contained about |- per

Wecent, of yttrium.                                       have reason to hope that this is only the first instalment of

discoveries to be made by this new method of research.

I cannot conclude without a reference to the brightening prospects of technical

chemistry in this country. I do not allude to the progress of any particular indus-

try, but to the increased facilities for the education of those engaged in the chemical
manufactures. First as to the workpeople. Hitherto the young artisan has had

little opportunity of learning at school what would be of the greatest service to

him in his after career. The traditions of the INIiddle Ages were all in favour of

literary culture for the upper classes, and the education suited for these has been

retained in our schools for the sons of the people. It is true that some knowledge

mof common things has been given the best schools, and the Education Depart-

ment has lately encouraged the teaching of certam sciences in the upper standards.

In the Mundella Code, however, which came into operation last year, ' elementary

science ' may receive a grant in all the classes of a boys' or girls' school, and in

the suggested scheme there is mentioned simple lessons on 'the chemical and
physical principles involved in one of the chief industries of England, among

which Agriculture may be reckoned,' while ' Chemistrj^ ' is inserted among ' the
specific subjects of instruction ' that may be given to the older children. It is im-

possible, as yet, to form an estimate of the extent to which managers and teachers

have availed themselves of this permission, for the examinations of her Majesty's

inspectors under the new code have only just commenced; but one of the best of

the Board schools in London has just passed satisfactorily in chemistry both with

boys and girls. I trust that in those parts of the country where chemical industries

prevail chemistry may be largely taken up in our elementary schools.

     The great deficiency in our present educational arrangements is the want of the
means of teacliing a lad who has just left the common school the principles of that

industry by which he is to earn his livelihood. The more purely scientific

chemistry, however, may be learnt by him now in those evening classes which may

be formed under the Education Department, as well as in those that have long

been established under the Science and Art Department. The large amount of

attention that is now being given to the subject of technical education is creating
in our manufacturing centres many technical classes and colleges for students of

older growth.

As to inventors, and the owners of our chemical factories, in addition to the

Chemical Society and the Chemical Institute, there has recently been founded the

Society of Chemical Industry. It came into existence with much promise of

success; at the close of its second year it numbered 1,400 members; it has

now powerful sections in London, Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, and Bir-

mingham                                          and  it  difliises  information  on  technical subjects  in  a well-conducted

monthly journal.

May the abstract science and its useful applications ever prove helpful to one

another, and become more and more one chemistry for the benefit of mankind.

The following Papers were read :^

1. On Sun-spots and the Chemical Tjlements in the San.
            Btj Professors Dewar and Liteing.

The authors take as the text of this paper the spectroscopic observations of sun-

spots made at Greenwich. They point out that it does not of necessity follow,

because a spot is less luminous than the photosphere, that its temperature must be

less, inasmuch as the radiation of short wave-length generally increases most rapidly

with the increase of temperature ; and the spectra of the vapours of some of the

metals most abundant in the sun, such as iron and magnesium, are stronger in the

ultra-violet than in the visible part of the spectrum. They remark that the imequal

widening of the Fraunhofer lines in spots is analogous to the behaviour of terrestrial

elements, which give lines of which some are far more readily expanded than others

by increasing the density of the vapour. They show that there is little reason for

supposing that the dark lines which are pecuhar to spots are due to elements which

are not to be found on the earth, because the spectra of our chemicals have as yet

been very partially examined                                                                                                                and they have found in a cursory examination of the
                                                                                                                                         ;

arc, while ceriimi and titanium are introduced into it, that a very great number of
new lines make their appearance, of which some show coincidences with dark lines

of spots too striking to be merely accidental. The disappearance of some Fraun-

hofer lines from spots they attribute, as others have done, to the emission of the

upper regions of the sun's atmosphere balancing the absorption below ; and they

point out that the rays for which this happens are the rays which belong to vapour

--of small tension, corresponding to Mr. Lockyer's long Unes rays which should be

emitted by the elements in their least complex state of aggregation. The singular

ray with wave-length 4923, which is a hue of iron of higli vapour-tension, but

behaves in the sun as a line of low vapour-tension, being frequently seen high up

in the solar storms and disappearing from spots, they think must belong to some

other metal as well as to iron. At the same time they point out that though the

vapoiu's in the upper regions of the solar atmosphere are generally of very low

tension, yet they may locally be much denser when solid matters from the coronal

region faU into the sun and are vapourised in passing through his atmosphere.

2. Colouring Matters of the Diazo-Group,^

   By RArHAEL Meldola, F.I.C, F.C.S.

     The author commenced by giving a sketch of the history of these compounds,

which were first discovered by Griess, and have since been largely investigated

owing to their great value as technical products. The diazo-group consists of two

N Nnitrogen atoms linked together, -- = -- , and, in accordance with the nomen-

clature proposed by WaUach, diazo-compoimds may be termed primary, secondary,

or tertiary, according as they contain one, two, or three diazo-groups. Primary
compounds have hitherto received the largest share of attention. All the known

bodies of importance belonging to this group may be referred to the three types :

C6H5-N = N-CgH5                                                                                                                                          Azobenzene.
                                                                                                                                                         Benzene-azonaphthalene.

N NCjgH, -- = -- Ojfjir,

The general formula is

                                                                                                                                            R-N = N-Il,

     Colouring matters are produced when one or both radicals contain acid or basic

substituents.

     Secondary compounds are formed on two types, viz.

                                               I. 11.

     The latter type (II.), in wliicli a phenol residue is indicated liy the aLbreviation
Ph, comprises such bodies as the phenol-bidiazobenzene,

of Griess. These bodies have recently been studied by AVallach, who terms them

diazo-compounds.

Secondary bodies of the first type (I.) are generally derived from amidoazo-

Acompounds.      series of secondary diazo-compounds of the general formula

                             p^N = N-Ph

Ahave been prepared by "Wallach by tbe following method :            diamine is first

operated upon, so as to acidulate one of its amido-groups, and the free amido-group

is then diazotised and combined with a phenol. Tlie acid radical is then eliminated

and the liberated NHo group diazotised and again combined with a phenol. The

series of operations is thus shown :

-p . NH,         p ^ NH . CJIjO          ^-n NIL, '    p ^ N = N . Ph
^'<NH2           ^'<N = N . Ph                         ^'<N = N . Ph
                                         ^<N = N . Ph

The author then proceeded to give a preliminary account of some experiments

which he had been engaged upon, with the object of obtaining secondary and

tertiary compounds by a new method. The starting-point in this new process is a

nitro-derivative of an amidoazo-compound, or of an azo-phenol :

group diazotised and combined with a phenol, thus giving rise to tertiary or second-

3. Suggestions for computing the Speed of Chemical Heaction.

                  Bij Professor Robert B. Warder.

Among the published determinations of the speed of chemical action, some have

already been discussed in connection with the ' action of ma.ss,' tliermo-chemistry,

electromotive force, and statical determinations of chemical affinity. In many
cases, however, a series of experiments is recorded, showing how far a certain re-

action progressed in a certain interval of time, with no attempt to reduce the

results to a common standard, or to render them available for quantitative study

Ain relation to other researches.     thorough discussion of all reliable data is very

desirable

1. To discover and investigate the causes of certain discrepancies betweeni

published observations and the current theories ;
     2. To attbrd more definite information of the nature of certain reactions, and

the conditions that determine their speed
                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;
     3. To atl'ord numerical data for a fuller study of the relations between speed of

reaction and other physical constants ; and

     4. To suggest fruitful lines for further researches in chemical dynamics.

    Among the most interesting achievements in modern organic chemistry are

Prof. Menschutkin's determinations of the speed and limits of the etherification of

the several classes of alcohols and acids ; and yet the published numbers, expressing

the ' initial speed ' {AnfangsgescMnndiykeit) or the extent of the reaction reachea
                                                                                        --;

in one hour, are by no means proportional to speeds during the first minute, or
under like conditions. Prof. L. Meyer has recently published an excellent -work
entitled * Dynamik der Atome ; ' and yet both the theory and the observations of
the variations in speed during the progress of a reaction are passed over very
lightly indeed. The prevalent theory of the action of mass is expressed by the

equation

                                           --- = kuv ....

                                           dt

where the differential coefficient expresses the rate of change in any substance
u, V, . . . represent the masses of the substances taking part in the change ; and
k'xs a, constant. Some observations have been made upon the influence of viscosity,
temperature, &c., upon the value of k ; but these have been so meagre that Prof.
Ostwald's skilful determinations usually seem to contradict the theory in its-

present state.

      Accurate determinations of the speed of a reaction require the greatest care,
not only for the measurement of time in addition to mass, but also to control the

temperature and other conditions within very narrow limits. Many who have not
the laboratory facilities or the natural taste for such researches may engage in the
mathematical discussion of results already published. Many determinations of

etherification, for various alcohols, acids, intervals, and temperatures, have been in
print for twenty years ; and yet no summary of the deducible value of k has come

to my notice. The chemical section of the Ohio Mechanics' Institute has recently

undertaken some work in such computations ; suggestions and co-operations from

chemists and physicists elsewhere are cordially invited. This subject includes
numerous mathematical problems that woidd aiford valuable practice for college

or university students, especially those who are candidates for honours. Professors
of mathematics who will act upon this suggestion may render valuable aid to the
cause of chemical research. The following subjects require special attention :

   --I. FimdamenUd Units. The following provisional system is now suggested :

for volume, one c.c. ; for mass, the chemical equivalent, expressed in m.g. ; and for
time, one hour. The unit of speed, as derived from these, would be the transfor-
mation of unit of each active body per unit of volume and time. Thus in a

normal solution of chloracetic acid (containing Qib m.g. in each c.c.) if u and ir
represent the quantities of acid and water respectively, we should have m = 1 and
V = 5.5'5, nearly.

      If the reaction

                  CILC1.C0.0H + HjO = CH,(OH).CO.OH + HCl

could continue for one hour at unit speed, the chloracetic acid would be entirely
decomposed in that time, yielding a normal solution of both glycolic and chlor-

hydric acid ; but, according to the equation

                                           --du = K7 UV,

                                           dt

the  speed  will  vary  with  u            if then  the  reaction  begins  with  rmit  speed,  kuv
                                        ;

equals unity at that moment, or k = 0-018.'

     The minute, hour, and    day have     all      been  used  by chemists  as  units  of time
                                                                                                               j

possibly one second or 1,000 seconds would be a better unit, for convenience in

comparing the constants of speed or of chemical affinity with those of heat,,

electricity, &c.
     --AII. Probable Errors.
                              determination of speed requires at least two observa-

Ations of time and two of mass.            series of observations is generally made ; and

the probable percentage error will vary greatly, according to the data selected or

the method of combining them. The theory of least squares should be so applied

in each case as to decide (approximately at least) the relative weights to be

assigned to the several determinations, and to calculate the probable error of the

result.

"^58 KEPORT-- 1883.

--III. Extensions of the Theory. Many determinations -whicla sliow clearly a

diminution of speed with diminution of the product of the active bodies do not

accord with the hypothesis that these quantities vary in the same ratio. In such,

cases  there  may he                                                               a  variation  in  the  viscosity,  or some  secondary   reaction                                   a
                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

careful study of the discrepancy or perturbation may lead to a satisfactory hypo-

--thesis, and suggest special experiments to test the causes suspected.
    .IV. Indirect Determinations. Whenever there are reciprocal reactions the con-

ditions of apparent equilibrium may indicate the ratio of the speed of each. Some

of these ratios may be combined with constants of speed directly determined, to

yield new values                                                                   for example, if the constants for  etherification  are  determined,
                                                                                ;

it would be easy to calculate those for the decomposition of ether by water in all

--cases where the limit of the reaction is known.
    V. Tahulution of Results. By bringing all the results obtained into systematic

order, this interesting class of data can be made available for comparison with

other fields of physical science.

          4. Ortho-Amido-Cimiamic Acid. By T. M. Morgan, B.Sc.

     To this acid, which I first obtained in very small quantity, and probably impure,
1 was led by the analytical results to assign a composition corresponding to amido-
phenyl-glyceric acid (' Chemical News,' xxxvi. 269). It was afterwards described
by Tiemann and Oppermann (' Ber. deut. chem. Ges.' xiii. 2061), who prepared it by
reduction of ortho-nitro-cinnamic acid by baric hydrate and ferrous sulphate. Its
purification is attended with much difiiculty wlien the corresponding nitro-acid is
reduced with stannous chloride by reason of the large amount of resinous matter
simultaneously produced. I have since prepared the amido-acid in much larger

quantity, and find that it possesses the property of forming an acid sodium salt of
very stable character, easily soluble in hot water and alcohol, sparingly soluble in
cold, and very readily crystallising in flat, thin, rhomboidal plates of bright yellow

colour. It may be formed by adding to an alcoholic solution of the sodium salt

sufficient acetic acid to combine with half the sodium, or by dissolving in alcohol
three molecules of ortho-amido-sodic cinnamate and one of the hydrochloride of
ortho-amido-cinnamic acid. This salt is well adapted for the purification of the
free acid ; the latter is best obtained pure by crystallisation from hot benzine, which
yields it in form of long brittle yellow prisms.

5. On the preparation of Cinnamic Acid. By T. M. Moegan, B.Sc.

This acid, which has acquired an additional interest of late through Ijeing the

mother substance from which indigo may, in several ways, be prepared, can now be

artificially produced in quantity by two "methods.

It is obtained by the well-known Perkins' reaction, when sodic acetate, acetic

anhydride, and benzaldehyde are boiled with a reversed condenser for eight or ten

hours. In this way, when pure materials are used, almost a quantitative yield is

obtained but if                                      the                              substances used are not pure, as by the employment   of  com-
                                                  ;

mercial sodic acetate, resinous products will be produced in large quantity and

very little cinnamic acid.

The second method has been made the subject of a patent. It consists in the

oxidation of cinnamyl-methyl-ketone by alkaline hypochlorites. This method is

less advantageous than the JForegoing, as the ketone is troublesome to prepare, the

reaction by which it is produced taking place slowly, only in very dilute aqueous

solutions, and not yielding a product corresponding with tlie materials employed.

But for the production of cinnamic acid in quantity it is better to employ the

old method of extracting it from liquid storax, which yields to prolonged boiling

with caustic potash about fifteen per cent. There has been some inconvenience in

freeing the acid from a resin extracted at the same time by the alkaline solution;

tut it will be found that treating the latter with common salt renders it incapable

of taking up the resin, or precipitates it if dissolved as a resin soap, the solution

then yielding on acidification an almost white precipitate, containing in a dry state

about ninety-four per cent, of cinnamic acid. Tlie remaining impurities are almost
uisoluWe in carbon disulphide, -whilst the acid readily dissolves, and is left as a
crystalline residue slightly discoloured on evaporation of the solvent.

5. On the Atomic Weight of Manganese. By Professor James Dewar,
                 M.A., F.B.S. , and Alexander Scott, M.A., B.Sc

    At the meeting of the Association in 1881 the authors gave an account of

some preliminary determinations of the atomic weight of manganese, arrived at by

the use of silver permanganate. This salt is very well fitted for such a purpose,

as it is easily obtained in a state of great purity by crystallisation, and is not at
aU hygroscopic. The first and most direct method employed was reduction by
heat alone, and finally ignition in a current of pure hydrogen. The reactions

taking place are

                  4AgMn04 = 2 (Ag^O.SMnO^) + 30,,
                  2(Ag.p,2MnO,) + GH^ = 2Ag2 + 4MnO + 6H,0.

     This method unfortunately did not give very concordant results, due probably
to the retention of hydrogen and imperfect reduction of the oxide of manganese.
Table I. gives the results of several experiments made in this way.

     The method finally adopted was to dissolve the silver permanganate in nitric
acid by the aid of a reducing agent, and then to determine, by the method of Stas,
the quantity of pure potassium bromide required for complete precipitation of
the silver in solution. The reducing agents which gave the best results were
potassium nitrite and sodium formate ; sulphurous acid was found to leave after
reduction always a trace of what was apparently sulphide, and was besides
troublesome from the insolubility of the silver sulphate produced. The results of
the titrations are given below in Table II.

produce the greatest effect on the length of the spectrum. It was shown that a
mixture of 1 per cent, of benzene in alcohol, or of cymene in turpentine, or vice
versa, could be easily detected by this method.

8. The application of Bisulphide of Carbon to the Scouring of Wool. By
                         Professor Willum Ramsat, Ph.D.

After a short review of the old processes of cleansing and scouring wool, the

author described the process invented by Mr. Mullings, of George Street, London,

known as the ' turbine process.' It consists in dissolving out smut and fatty

matters from wool by means of carbon disulphide. To effect this the wool is

placed in a special form of hydro-extractor, covered with a dome-shaped cover,

evaporation of the solvent being guai-ded against by water-joints. Bisulphide of

carbon is then admitted, so as thoroughly to soak the wool, and the machine being

caused to rotate the solvent is expelled ; the last traces are driven out by admit-

ting cold water. The features of the process, which distinguish it from all other

similar ones, and which secure its success, are the avoidance of a high temperature

and the use of cold water in expelling tlie solvent. The bisulphide runs into

settling tanks, where it is separated  from  the  water                                        and  thence  it is removed to
                                                                                            ;

retorts and distilled, leaving a residue of suint. Attention was drawn to the fact

that the French bisulphide, made from coke, gave much better results than the

English bisulphide, made fi-om charcoal.

The wool cleansed by this method has a better appearance, gives a finer yarn,

and may be woven into a fabric preferable to that given by the old process.

It is calculated tbat the annual saving in England which would be caused by

the introduction of the turbine process would amount to close on a million and a

half sterling.

Details of the process were given in the paper.

9. On the Conversion, of Oleic Acid into Palmitic Acid, and Fusions with
     Caustic Alkalies at High Temperatures. By "Wm. Lant Carpenter,

      B.A., B.Sc, F.C.S.

     At the March meeting of the London Section of the Society of Chemical
Industry the author drew attention to the mode of procedure whereby M. Radisson,
of Marseilles, was able to carry out on an industrial scale Warentrapp's reaction

(announced in 1841) of

                   0,3113,0, + 2KH0 = C,Jl3,K0, + C.HgKO, + II,.

    At the last Paris Industrial Exhibition M. Fournier, of Marseilles, the largest
stearic acid maker in France, exhibited palmitic acid candles which had been made

from oleic acid by this process.
     Oonsiderable interest was excited at the meeting above referred to as to the

exact way in which these potash fusions on so large a scale were carried out, and
the author was asked for many details which he was then imable to give. Since
then he has spent a week at Marseilles studying the process, and now submits
some new details to the Section.

     The fusion is effected in a vessel called a ' cartouche.' It is cylindrical, with a
dished bottom of cast iron, 3 '20 metres in diameter; the sides and top are of
wrought iron, 1'30 metre in height ; a mechanical agitator works in the interior,
and an exit-pipe leads through a coke tower-condenser to a gasholder, to collect
the hydrogen. The fire-bars are about 1"75 metre from the bottom of the car-
touche, and the fire is only a few centimetres thick. At the commencement
1,500 kilogrammes of oleic acid and 2,500 kilogrammes of caustic potash ley at 43°
B. sp. gr., are pumped into the cartouche, and the temperature is slowly raised to
300" 0. Evolution of hydrogen commences at 290°. Between that and 320° the
reaction takes place, and at 320° the process is arrested by the injection of steam
by a Giffard's injector. All access of air must be avoided diu-ing the operation,
                                    :

wliicli is best done by maiutaining an atmosphere of steam in the cartouche. The

time necessary for a complete operation is from thirty-six to forty hours. In
addition to acetic acid and hydrogen, caprylic alcohol, sebacic acid, caproic acid,
and a new acid for which the name hippomic is proposed, are among the products
of the reaction, and in the case of some fats hircic acid also. Hydrocarbons of the
paraffin series are usually formed also.

     Owing to the want of iluidity of sodium oleate, and its bad conducting power
for heat, the process has to be somewhat modified for a caustic soda fusion. Of

the various substances tried, to give the mass fluidity, the use of paraffin has been
attended with the greatest success, and the author saw a successful conversion

effected in this way on a large scale for a laboratory.

10. On the Action of Sunlight on P203.^ Bij the Rev. A. Irving, B.Sc.

Following Wislicenus, the author finds that carefully prepared P.jOg, when

exposed in hermetically sealed tubes to the action of direct sunlight, is entirely

replaced by  amorphous phosphorus  and PoO^                                        (the latter  proved by the  amm.
                                                                                '

molybdate test). The author has also found that if one of these tubes in which

the transformation has been effected is kept for a long time, a plentiful growth of

Pcrystalline takes place upon the walls of the tube, apparently by slow sublima-

tion of the red P.

     The author suggests, as an explanation of the reduction of some of the P^O to

P, the loosening of the bond which holds P to P in the molecule, as would be

shown in the graphic formula  1--0

                              ll>0

     In a layer of a considerable fraction of a millimetre in depth the molecules
directly in contact with the glass wall of the tube would be first acted upon, and
most strongly by sunlight ; the effect of this he conceives to be the loosening of the

double bond which holds P to P, and an alteration in the relative strength of the
P P Paffinities of to and of to 0. It is not difficult to see how, under such altered

conditions induced by the action of a purely physical agent (heat as well as light
will produce the result), the molecules of V^O^ which are not so strongly acted
upon may, by their greed for oxygen (as shown by their spontaneous inflam-
mability in moist air), act as a reducing agent upon the contiguous molecules which
are more directly exposed to the action of light. This would perhaps explain the
reaction which Wislicenus suggests, as follows

     The explanation which has been suggested above seems also to help us to
understand wliy the phosphide PjHj is spontaneously inflammable in air, whereas

the phosphide P H3 is not so.

     The author is inclined to attach some importance to the notion here suo-wested

as illustrating the disturbance of chemical equilibrium and consequent partial dis-
sociation, as a preliminary to chemical reactions.

          4. Electrolysis of dilute Sulphuric Acid in Secondary Batteries.

              By Dr. J. H. Gladstone, F.B.S., and Alfred Tribe.

     The authors ia their recent papers had given the results of the chemical
changes which take place in charging and in discharging secondary batteries of the
Plante or Faure type. In expressing these changes by means of formulae they
had assumed that the compound decomposed in the cell was H,,SO^. The present
communication was to consider more fully the question as to what the compound

electrolysed actually is. Is it water, as used to be supposed ? Is it the actual

Ho so/? Or is it some chemical combination of the two, such as hexabasic

sulphm'ic acid, which Frankland has lately assumed to be the electrolyte on the
authority of Bourgoiu's experiments ? The authors liad tested the value of these
experiments by means of a divided cell, in one limb of which was a solution of
sulphate of copper, and in the other dikite sulphuric acid. They found that,
independently of the actual molecular change, which in accordance with Grotthus'
hypothesis must ensue during electrolysis, there was also an actual passage of
sulphuric acid into the limb containing sulphate of copper. The conclusion from
this and other experiments was that we have no data to determme whether it is
sulphuric acid or some hydrate that is electrolysed ; but analogy would lead to
the conclusion that it is sulphuric acid itself. Hence they retain the former simple
method of representing the phenomena.

              5. On the Mobility of Oold and Silver in Molten Lead.

                  By Professor W. Chandler Roberts, F.B.S.

     The author showed that metals interpenetrate when molten at very varyino"
rates. Antimony and copper, for instance, alloy with comparative slowness, but
.on the other hand the mobility of silver and gold in lead and in bismuth is so rapid
as to more nearly resemble the rate of diffusion of gases than that of a crystalline
salt in a liquid. The methods of manipulation were given at length, and consist

generally in observing the rate of passage of gold, starting with an alloy contain-
ino- 30 per cent, of the precious metal, through a curved or straight column of
molten lead or bismuth. Exact numerical determinations have yet to be made.

                          By Edward C. C. Stanford, F.C.S.

     The author points out that a large fringe of marine vegetation surrounds the
shores of Great Britain and Ireland, and that this constitutes an immense amount
of raw material which is almost unutilised. The subject is discussed under three
applications ; for food, for manure, and for the manufacture of kelp. There ought
lo be a large application for food, as the plants are highly nitrogenous, resembling

the fungi, with the important difference that they contain no poisonous species.
For manure the algae, containing 80 per cent, of moisture, are of little value as
against artificial manures. The manufacture of kelp, or seaweed ash, is gradually

dying out ; it is only now one of the sources of iodine, and it never really utilised
the seaweed. The commoner species, named in the order in which they grow, are

the Fucus vesiculosus, F. nodosus, F. serratus, Laminaria stenophylla, and L.
digitata. These all contain the new suhstance. It can often he seen in the long
fronds of the Laminaria as a sac of glairy fluid, which, when evaporated, jdelds a
kind of vegetable albumen called algin. This substance has some characteristic
properties ; it is instantly coagulated by mineral acids, even a 2 per cent, solution
becoming semi-solid. Acetic acid does not affect it. Lime-water and the salts of
the alkaline earths, with the exception of magnesium, also coagulate it. Boracic
acid does not affect it. It is precipitated by alcohol. Metallic salts generally pre-
cipitate it, but mercury bichloride has no effect. It differs from albumen in not

coagulating on heating.
     It contains nitrogen, but no sulphur. It is insoluble in water, and requires

about 20 per cent, of sodium carbonate for its solution.
     The method adopted for treating the seaweed is as follows. The seaweeds are

first macerated in cold water, which removes about a third of the weight. The
residue is bleached by a weak solution of chlorinated lime, acidulated with hydro-

chloric acid. It is then acted on in the cold with about a tenth of its weight of
sodium carbonate, heated, filtered, and evaporated. The residue in the filter is
cellulose, pretty pure, and ready at once for making paper.

     The salts from the water solution vary according to the plant ; an average
sample from Laminaria is appended :

       Calcium sulphate . . . . 1-G9

       Potassium sulphate .                           11-29

       Potassium chloride .                           19-90

     Ajyplications. The algin, which can be obtained in large quantity, has been
applied as a stiffener of fabrics, replacing starch, than which it is tougher and more
transparent. It forms an excellent mordant in dyeing, being easily rendered in-
soluble. It is an efficient ' boiler fluid ' for precipitating the lime salts and pre-
venting incrustation. In the insoluble form it much resembles horn and bone, and
can be employed to replace those substances. It possesses great agglutinating
power, and will convert sand, plumbago, chalk, and such difficult substances, into
solid hard blocks. Under the form of ' carbon cement ' it has been largely used
for covering steam boilers as a non-conductor of heat, the cement consisting of
charcoal containing about 3 per cent, of algin ; the charcoal employed is from sea-
weed, so that the whole coating is made from that material.

     It is a good non-conductor of electricity, and an efficient agent for emulsifying

oils and for fining wines and spirits. By the process indicated the whole plant is
utilised for the first time. The importance of the new industry to the Highlands
and the West of Ireland can scarcely be overrated.

7. Methods for Golcing Coal and recovering the Bye-products.^

                 By Watson Smith, F.C.8., F.I.C.

     There are various forms of plant for coking coal, for the production of coke for

metallurgical purposes, which may be classed as follows :

and Dubochet's, Pernolet's and Simon-Carves's ovens.
     In Jameson's oven is a simple modification of the Beehive form. Jameson

substitutes for the solid floor of the latter oven, one of perforated quarls, but quite
recently finding difficulty in the stopping-up of the perforations, he uses tiles,

placed on sleeper-walls, and somewhat apart, so as to allow spaces between them.
JFrom this floor and underneath it a pipe passes to the hydraulic main, and in this
way aU the ovens are connected witli the hydraulic, and thus with the usual

scrubbing and exhausting apparatus usual in gasworks.
     The coke obtained by Jameson's process is good, in fact like that from the

Beehive oven. As regards ammonia, Jameson states that he can obtain ammo-
niacal liquor equal to a production of from .5 to 15 lbs. of sulphate of ammonia per

ton of coke (equalling about 3 to 9 lbs. per ton of coal). Truly there is a some-
what uncertain soimd given by these figures, betokening some want of definiteness,
and that they cannot be derived from an average involving trials on a reaUy large

scale.

The returns Jameson gives of tar yielded per ton of coal, viz. 6 to 15 galls.

per ton of coke (equalling about 3i to 9 galls, per ton of coal) are also somewhat

bewildering, and do not appear to have been derived as averages of extensive trials

so much as from the results of scattered experiments. However, this tar or tar-oil

the author has carefully examined, and finds it to possess all the characteristics of

tars produced at low temperatures. It has a specific gravity of 0'960. No benzol

is present in this tar. but the statements which have been frequently made to the

eflect that no aromatic substances, only paraffins, are present, is not true. Small

quantities of toluol and of xylol are certainly present in admixture with bodies of

the marsh-gas series. The chief bulk of the Jameson tar, however, consists of oils

boiling between 250° and 350°, and these oils suitably purified and refined the

author has found to be of little value for burning-lamps, and but of secondary value

Aas lubricants. They are quite devoid of blueness or fluorescence.  considerable

proportion of oil distils over above .350°, viz. from something like 400° to the point

at which pitch remains in the retort, and from these oils paraffin scale does separate,

though in unsatisfactory quantity. The parafiiu wax obtained has a high melting
point, viz. about .58° C. : the paraffin wax of the Scottish shale distillers melting

at about 52° C.

The crude phenols extracted in the usual way from the oils boiling between

200° and 300° contain a series of phenols of increasing boiling points of a most

peculiar kind, certain of them resembling the constituents of the creosote of wood-

tar. Moreover, others of these phenols produce iu combination with alkalis blue

or violet and red-coloured compounds, decomposed by acids, with destruction of

the colours. These colours are of no stability or value. Not a trace of either

naphthalene or of anthracene is present in Jameson's tar. Amongst the closed

ovens, the Simon-Carves is the best form, for it yielded excellent metallurgical

coke, only lacking the silvery glance of the Beehive product, but possessing even

more density and solidity.
     The ammoniacal liquor obtained amounts to 27"7 gallons at from 6° to 7°

Twaddell, and the tar, which the author has found to be almost identical in com-

position with the best London coal tars, and having a specific gravity of 1'20, to 6*12

gallons per ton of coal respectively. These are the average results from the coking

of 7,000 tons of coal in the Simon-Carv6s's ovens at work at Messrs. Pease's West

Collieries, in Crook by Darlington, and the Messrs. Pease are so satisfied witli the
work done, that to the 25 ovens with which the above results were obtained as
regards bye-products, 25 more ovens are being added. The yield of coke in the
above experiment was excellent, viz. 77 per cent, of the coal used. It has been
stated that the coke drawn from the Carves's ovens, after watering to eflfect rapid
cooling, becomes too wet. This could easily be obviated by drawing immediately
into underground vaults, adding a little water to choke out cqmbustion, and fasten-

ing on the lids of the vaults.
     In the Carves's ovens large charges of 4^ tons are used, and these can be

coked in 48 hours. The gas is drawn from the ovens by an exhauster so slowly

that a slight pressui-e is always caiised to exist in the ovens so as to prevent air
beino- sucked in. This gas is then condensed, and scrubbed to separate tar and

ammonia water, and finally returns to the ovens, under the bottoms and around
the sides of which it circulates through bottom and side flues. On enteringthe
bottom flue by a jet contained in an annular tube, air is also drawn in and mixed
with the gas' to effect the perfect combustion of the latter. But this air_ has
already received a preliminary heating to as high as 600° C. by passing in circu-
latmg "flues from the outside air, these flues enwrapping and co-circulating so to
speak with hot and waste gas flues which thus serve to heat up the air in the air-
flues. Thus the waste gases pass in their flues in the opposite direction taken by
the air drawn through its flues towards the annular pipe, by which it is mixed

with the fuel-gas as it enters the bottom flue of the oven furnace.

      This improvement of a subsequent heating of the air has raised the temperature

attainable in the ovens from 2,200° to 3,000° Centigrade.
      Finally, the Carvess tar contains large quantities of naphthalene and anthra-

cene, as well as benzol, toluol, xylol, and carbolic acids, and so far as I know it is

the only coke-oven tar furnished which is really and completely identical with the

coal tars of the gas-retorts.

2. On the alleged Direct Uninn of Nitrogen and Hydrogen.'^
                    By H. Beereton Bakek.

     Doubt having been expressed as to the statement by Mr. Stillingfleet_ Johnston '

that the elements nitrogen and hydrogen may be caused to unite directly, the

following experiments were undertaken to test the accuracy of his_results._
     Pure nitrogen was obtained by exposing moist phosphorus in air contained in a

bell-jar, the absorption of oxygen being rendered complete by passing the gases
through three wash-bottles of potassium pyi-ogallate. Pm-e hydrogen was prepared
by dissol-ving zinc in sulphuric acid, and passing the gas through two cylinders
containing marbles soaked in potassium permanganate solution. The two gases
were dried by passing through a wash-bottle of strong sulphuric acid. They were
tested for arnmonia by passing them through a tube containing Nessler's solution.
They were then passed over heated spongy platinum, and into a second tube of

Nessler's solution,

     Three experiments were made, two lasting for an hour and a half each, while
the third was carried on for two hours. In the last experiment the platinum

sponge was heated to bright redness by the gas blowpipe for half an hour, a dull
red heat being employed in the other cases. In none of these experiments was the
slightest trace of ammonia formed.

   AAnother series of experiments was performed with different apparatus. glass

U tube was made, with one arm much longer than the other. The end of the

shorter arm was sealed, and some spongy platinum placed in the sealed end. The
open end of the tubewas made to dip under a solution of potassium pyrogallate.

By means of a flexible tube, air was removed from the longer limb, until only

20 cc. of air remained in the tube. It was allowed to stand over the alkaline
pyrogallate till all the oxj-gen was absorbed. After replacing the pyrogallate in
the longer limb bj' pure water, hydrogen was added by holding a pellet of sodium
under the open end of the tube. The spongy platinum was heated, sometimes by

a Bunsen lamp and sometimes by the gas-blowpipe. When the tube was cool,

Nessler's solution was passed up the longer limb by a bent pipette, and owing to
the peculiar shape of the tube, it could be shaken about in the gas without wetting
the spongy platinum. In no case was ammonia formed.

     Mr. Johnston found that ammonia was produced when hydrogen and the gas
obtained by heating ammonium nitrite were passed over heated platinum sponge.
It is known that oxides of nitrogen are produced by the decomposition of ammo-
nium nitrite, together with nitrogen gas. To free the nitrogen from these oxides,

Mr. Johnston used an elaborate absorbing apparatus. After leaving the absorbers
of nitric oxide, it was mixed with hydrogen and passed through three wash-
bottles of ferrous sulphate solution, and then over tbe heated platinum sponge.
The amount of ammonia was less by one half than that produced in the former
experiment. Before mixing with the nitrogen, the hj^drogen was passed through

a wash-bottle of silver nitrate. This introduces a new source of error. Hydrogen

decomposes a solution of nitrate of silver with evolution of oxides of nitrogen.

The author made some experiments to see if the three wash-bottles of ferrous sul-
phate, used by Mr. Johnston, were adequate for the removal of these oxides. lie

found that they were not.

    It maybe concluded, therefore, that all the ammonia produced in Mr. Johnston's
experiments was the product of the reaction between hydrogen and an oxide of

nitrogen, under the influence of spongy platinum. Hydrogen, therefore, does not
luiite directly with nitrogen when the mixed gases are passed over heated spongy

platinum. Consequently, as far as our present evidence goes, we must regard Mr.

Johnston's statement that nitrogen exists in two allotropic modifications as having
no foundation.

    3. On the Decomposing Action that Chloride of Aluminixun exerts on
         Hydrocarbons. By Professors C. Friedel and J. M. Crafts.

     The authors began by calling to mind their previous researches showing that the
synthesis of hydrocarbons, and of ketones, maybe effected by the action of aluminic
chloride on a mixture of an aromatic hydrocarbon with the chloride of a hydrocarbon
radical, or of an acid radical, and that the anhydrides of acids, and even oxygen
and sulphur, enter into similar reactions with aromatic hydrocarbons.

      In the course of these investigations they observed that aluminic chloride exerts
a decomposing action on complex hydrocarbons, and it is this action that they have

now examined more in detail, in the hope that it might throw some light on the
mechanism of the synthetic action of aluminic chloride.

     Naphthalin was distilled with 25 per cent, aluminic chloride, when the distillate
was found to consist of benzol and hydrides of naphthalin, and a carbonaceous residue
remained. The hydrides are partly soluble in sulphuric acid, the insoluble portion
contains a large proportion of Cj^Hjg, or CigH^o, and this hydrocarbon boils at

about 183°.

     The portion boiling between 204° and 206° appears on analysis to be CjoHj,.
TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.                            469

     If the naplithalin is digested with the chloride of aluminium at a lower tempera-
ture, ohtained either by mixing it with benzol or heating it in an oil-bath to 160°,

the products are altogether ditterent.

     In this case the products have a much higher boiling point, consisting chiefly
of isodinaphthyl which may be separated from the oils that accompany it by crys-

tallisation from benzol or petroleum ether.
     This isodinapththyl melts at 187°, and boils at 485° (by air thermometer), and

yields a picrate greatly resembling that of naphthalin. The liquid portion, distilled
again with aluminic cliloride, gave benzol, naphthalin, and hj'drides of naphthalin,

while the isodinaphthyl treated in the same way was almost completely carbonised.

   We may therefore conclude that naphthahn gives isodinaphthyl and hydrides

boiling at a high temperature, and that these latter afterwards produce benzol and
naphthalin hydrides.

      Benzol is not afiected at its boiling point, but if heated with aluminic chloride

Cin sealed tubes to 235° it becomes very brown, and on opening the tube a good

deal of gas escapes ; this gas burns with a pale flame, and the contents of the tube

distilled with water give hydrocarbons boiling from 80° to 160°. When the tem-

perature does not rise above 200° no gas is found in the tubes, even when these are
heated for eighteen hours. On fractionation two-thirds of benzol is recovered, the
rest consists of toluol (whence benzyl chloride was prepared in order to establish

its identity), ethylbenzol, and a portion boiling above 200° which on crystallisation
from alcohol melts at 69° and boils at 250-255°, and has the properties of diphenyl.

     Diphenylmethane distilled with aluminic chloride gives a mixture boiling at
80°-120°, containing benzol and toluol.

     Triphenylmethane distilled with more than half its weight of chloride of
akuninium gave only benzol. Triphenylmethane, mixed with seven times its weight
of benzol, and heated with chloride of aluminium for two days in an oil-bath to a
temperature just below the boiling point of the mixture, gave nearly half its weight
of diphenylmethane.

     Hexmnethylbenzol heated with one-third of its weight of chloride of aluminium
for three-quarters of an hour gave oft' plenty of a non-illuminating gas, and left a
product boiling at 200-220°, from which crystals of durol were deposited (melting
at 97°), the mother liquor being the isomeric tetramethylbenzol.

     Durol gives off" gas, a portion boiling at 150°-160°, the chief portion at 190°-
200° containing trimethylbenzol mixed with some xylol.

     In the case of the poly-substituted methyl benzols one or more methyl groups
is displaced by hydrogen ; in all cases very little hydrochloric acid is given off.

     In order that the same hypothesis may explain both the destructive and the

synthetic action of aluminic chloride, the authors suggest that whereas they have

formerly assvuned that the equation CgHg + Al^Clg = CgHjAloClj + HCl repre-

sents the first stage in the synthetical reactions, so this same equation is also the
first stage of the present decompositions. They assume that the compound of
O^H-AljClj is broken up by heat into diphenyl and subchloride of aluminium, and
that the latter is decomposed by the free hydrochloric acid into aluminic chloride
and hydrogen, and that it is the hydrogen thus set free that exerts the reducing

action observed.

     Thus benzol is reduced to the groups methyl and ethyl, which give rise to
methyl and ethylbenzol.

     Naphthalin forms dinaphthyl and its hydrides, the latter giving naphthalin

hydrides.

     In the case of di- and tri-phenylmethane and the methylated benzols, the group
AljClj seems to displace a phenyl or methyl group, which, under the reducing
action of the mixture, appears as benzol or methane respectively.

      It is also to be observed that a quantity of carbonaceous matter, evidently
poor in hydrogen, is always formed.

    7. On the Constitution of the Natural Fats. By J. Alfred "Wankltn

                                          and William Fox.

     The received view of the constitution of the natural fats is that they are ethers

of glycerin. Furthermore, it is generally maintained that the natural fats are tri-

--glycerides that is to say, that they are fully saturated ethers of glycerin. The

recognised exceptions are spermaceti (which is palmitate of cetyl) and cholesterine,
the constitution of which is regarded as being uncertain. Our investigations have

led us to the conclusion that among the natural fats must he enumerated a new

class of compounds, viz. the ethers of iso-glycerius, and also that di-glycerides, or
two-thu'ds saturated ethers of glycerin, are to he met with among the natural fats.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ';

      In collecting the actual experimental data relating to the natural fats, the
authors have noted that, whilst the theoretical, or very nearly theoretical, yield of
the fatty acids has frequently heen obtained from a fat, the theoretical yield of the

glycerin is missing. When a ton of tallow is subjected to the action of steam,

they are informed that 10 cwt. of oleic acid, and 9 cwt. of stearic acid, and 1 cwt.
of glycerin are the products. The theory requires that 2 cwt. of glycerin should be

given.

    When Dupr^ subjected a weighed quantity of butter to the action of water at

elevated temperatures, the sum of the fatty acids aud the glycerin fell considerably
short of the total required by the equation.

     The marked failure to get the theoretical yield of glycerin is a fact which de-

--mands an explanation. That explanation the authors are prepared to supply as

follows: 'They hold that accompanying the glycerides there are iso-glycerides.

From its structure an iso-glyceride can yield neither glycerin nor iso-glycerin when

it is saponified, but must yield water and the corresponding fatty acid."

    The structui'al formula of common glyceriu is

 9. On the Develojpment of Crystals from Transparent Glass by the Action of
               Solvents tipon it. By William TnoMsoN, F.B.S.E.

     Transparent glass has usually been regarded as an amorphous substance, but,
from experiments which the author recently made, he has been led to believe either

that it is crystalline, or that its structure is peculiarly interesting.

      Professor Tyndall, in speaking of the beautiful crystalline structure of transparent

ice, shown by means of a beam of the electric light which, passing through it melts
some portions of the ice so as to develop six-petalled flower-like crystals, the images
of which are thrown upon the screen, says that the molecules of the ice present a
marked contrast to those of glass, which are devoid of symmetry or crystalline

structiu-e.

     It occurred to the author that if glass could be melted in a manner similar to ice,
one could imagine it possible that it might be demonstrated that the molecules of
which glass is composed might also be shown to be built up in a manner no less
symmetrical or beautiful than those of ice.

    With a view of undoing the structure of glass to determine whether it had any-

thingof a symmetrical or crystalline nature, he treated some ordinaryglass microscope
slides with hydrofluoric acid in diflerent ways, but found that it produced a nodular

appearance in the crevices formed by the etching process. On microscopical exami-

nation, he observed that these nodules were arranged to each other as if they were
cr3'stals with their edges dissolved oS", and the general arrangement of these nodules
to each other further indicated a crystalline or symmetrical structure. Believing
that hydrofluoric acid acted too vigorously, he endeavoured to find another agent to
act upon glass with less energy.

     Neutral sodium fluoride had very little action upon glass, but acid sodium
fluoride acted upon it with considerable energy. The fluoride when removed from
the glass by Avashing and scrubbing with a hard nailbrush in a stream of water
to remove any adherent matter, drying, and then examining by the microscope,
showed that the sides of the crevice formed by the etching were composed of
myriads of well-defined hexagonal pyramids, most of them appearing as if built up
in layers, showing a series of steps.

    Neutral ammonium fluoride was found to act on glass, although not rapidly.

When a drop of a solution of ammonium fluoride containing excess of ammonia

was put on glass, heated to evaporate the water, and the heat continued till the
ammonium salt volatilised, it was found on washing the glass in a stream of
water, scrubbing with a hard brush, drying, and examining by a microscope or
good pocket lens, that the surface touched by the liquid had been removed, and
that it had been resolved into beautiful fern-like crystals such as may be observed by
the freezing of moisture on the sm-face of window-panes in winter.

    Lastly, when a drop of the ammonium fluoride solution was left on the glass

in the cold over night, it removed the surface of the glass here and there all over,
producing well-defined five- and six-sided figures, the surface of the glass being re-
moved within the figures.

     The results of these experiments lead the author to believe that transparent glass,
--472 BEPOEx 1883.

wluch has been usually regarded as amorphous, is either built up of crystalline forms,
or, as has been suggested to him by Professor T. G. Bonney, the amorphous silica
in the glass rearranges its molecules and becomes crystalline.

10. On certain Molecular Movements in the vicinity of thin Iron Plates.
                        By William Thomson, F.B.S^E.

The experiments described in this paper were a continuation of those made by

the author some time ago, the results of a number of which were brought by him

before this section two years ago. At that time he was under the impression

that certain phenomena which were produced by leaving iron in contact with

wet prussian-blue dyed cloth resting on wet blotting-paper, appeared to be

mdue    some way or other to mag-netic action, which had directly or indirectly

caused the well-defined lines of insoluble prussian-blue which appeared to have

flowed from the iron into the blotting-paper underneath the cloth. Smce then

he has made experiments with iron strongly magnetic, and simultaneously with

Bimilar pieces of iron which were only magnetic from the action of the earth's

magnetism. In each case the lines of colour were produced, but they developed

to a greater distance, and much more regularly, from the piece of iron which was

very slightly magnetic, than from the one which was .strongly magnetised.

     In one series of experiments slips of thin iron, l~ x f^ x -0075 inch, cut from
ferro-type photograph plate cleaned and polished, were placed on slips of

glass and covered by thin layers of glycerine jelly, coloured by prussian-blue

(which was developed by the action of potassium ferricyanide on ferrous sul-

phate), containing also a slight excess of ferricyanide, and made famtly acid

with hydrochloric acid. One of these was laid aside, and the other supported

on the poles of a horse-shoe magnet placed with its poles upright, the glass

being kept in position by the action of the magnet on the slip of soft iron on

the other side of the glass : the slip of soft iron was thus rendered magnetic. In

each case a deep-blue colour extended out from the iron all around, forming an

oval, but the colour extended more rapidly from the iron which was not rendered

magnetic, than from the other which was magnetised. The colour then collected

round the margin of the oval from the former, and became most intense at the two

ends. Four well-defined thin straiglit lines of the prussian-blue colour then developed

from the ends of the oval, going towards each other at an angle of about 45° from

the line of the metallic slip till they came to the margin of the jelly on the glass
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

and some weeks later other weU-defined but curved lines developed from the ends

of the oval, which gradually exfoliated until five had formed at each end of the

oval going in beautifully formed curves to the edge of the glycerine jelly. The

slip placed over the magnet formed a deep-blue oval round the iron slip ; about one-
half the area of the oval ultimately formed round the non-magnetised slip, and no

lines of colour developed from it.

Presumably the deeper blue developed around the iron in these two experiments

was due to the action of the acid upon it, and the combination of the ferricyanide

with the iron thus brought into solution. Another similar experiment was made

by using the same proportion of ferricyanide and acid, but without the addition

of ferrous sulphate to colour the jelly blue. In this case prussian blue formed a

thick coating on the top of the iron slip, but it did not extend outwards from the

margin of the slip. In a third experiment a drop of jelly, deeply coloured with

prussian blue, was placed on the surface of transparent glycerine jelly, but

after nearly two years the colour had not extended in the faintest degree into

the colourless medium. In a fourth experiment a slip of blotting-paper, the size of

the iron slips used in the first-mentioned experiment, saturated with a solution of

ferrous sulphate and dried, was placed in part of the coloured jelly mixture

Afirst mentioned.  blue colour, deeper than that of the surrounding jelly,

gradually extended outwards, forming after a few weeks a small oval roimd the

paper, which did not increase in size or undei'go any further alteration after two

years.
                            ;

TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  473

     From these last-mentioned results one is led to believe that molecules of colour-
ing matter distributed throughout the solid medium of the jelly aid in the spread-

ing or diffusion throughout its mass of colouring matter similar to itself, and that
the curved and straight lines of blue colouring matter are directly due to the
influence of the metallic iron on the molecules of prussian blue around it.

     In another experiment, made with a view of observing the action of the magnet-
ism of the earth on the phenomena observed in the experiments first mentioned, two

                                                                   slips of iron, A, B, similar to those used in

                                                              the first experiment, were placed at right
                                                           angles to and about an inch from each
                                                          other. One was placed in a line with, and
                                                           the other would of course be at right
                                                         angles to, the magnetic meridian. The re-
                                                         sults produced were quite unexpected. Each
                                                               slip of iron appeared to assume a polarity
                                                           the colour of the jelly became bleached in

                                                               a circle round one-half of each slip of iron,
and the colour so removed appeared to be deposited so as to form a thick coating

on the other half of each slip, and after many months lines of colour extended

from the centre of each slip of iron, forming a series of circular lines round the

bleached area.

     Experiments were made with slips of iron and copper, with iron and zinc,
and with zinc and copper placed at a distance from each other, and the results
showed that the one had a very marked action upon the other, although they were
not in metallic contact. With zinc and copper bubbles of gas were developed
from the zinc at the edge nearest to the copper slip, the bubbles forcing their
way through the thick jelly from the centre of the edge of the zinc plate in nearly

straight lines towards the copper, whilst the bubbles developed at other parts of

the same edge of the zinc plate forced their way through the thick jelly in straight
lines which, if prolonged, would all have met about the centre of the edge of the
copper plate facing the zinc one. Gas was also simultaneously developed at the
edge of the copper plate opposite the zinc one. From the copper, however, the

gas did not develope in lines, but in a circular form beginning from the centre of
the copper slip and gradually extending outwards towards the zinc.

      Other experiments with slips of copper and iron, similarly placed at a distance
from each other of about an inch, also showed a marked action upon each other by
the lines of prussian blue molecules which flowed from them. These lines flowed
from the one metal to the other. They did not, however, go by what one would
take to be the directions of least resistance, but flowing away from the opposite
metals they swept round the outside, and then turned inwards as if the lines from
the two metals would join ; but the glass plates not being large enough, they
stopped at the margin of the coloured jelly. One curious result observed in those
lines was the formation of eddies ; one line of colour developed from the metal
going, for instance, in the opposite direction to the hands of a clock, suddenly ended
in an eddy, whilst another line flowing from the eddy formed part of a circle going

in the opposite direction.

    A number of experiments were made by placing discs of the same thin iron

'0075 inch thick x -67 inch diameter on paper coloured with prussian blue lying

on the top of wet blotting-paper, the whole being enclosed between two plates
of glass and immersed in pure water. The blue colour on the paper gradually
became bleached in a remarkable manner; the bleaching seemed to take place round
the iron in an elliptical form, the iron disc being, roughly speaking, in the position
of one of the foci of the ellipse, and ultimately the whole of the paper became
bleached. In two experiments after bleaching the author removed the top glass. In

the first there formed, immediately the air touched the surface of the bleached paper,
a deep blue spot about half a diameter from the disc, and the whole of the paper
then gradually became of a slate blue colour. In the second an irregularly round

deep blue spot made its appearance the instant the top glass was removed, and
the paper then gradually became blue. Thus it would appear as if the discs of
                                --

474 EEPORX-- 1883.

metallic iron exercised some influence on the deoxised molecules of the colour at
some distance from them.

     Other similar experiments were made, in which the glass plates with the disc on
the Prussian blue paper were allowed to remain for a much longer time after
bleaching of the prussian blue had taken place, when black oxide of iron was
gradually formed round the iron discs in a remarkable manner, with alternate rings
of the black oxide and the bleached paper upon which no black oxide was deposited.

     In one of these experiments there was produced a distinct ring of black oxide
of iron at a distance of exactly half the diameter of the iron disc from it, the ring
being precisely the same diameter as the disc employed.

     This circle was produced as distinctly as if it had been drawn in ink by com-
passes, but the ring was thicker next the disc. Some months afterwards this ring
almost faded away.

     Experiments were made nith lead discs on paper coloured with chromate of
lead, but no apparent action was produced on the colouriag material.

    Glycerine jelly may thus be used for studying the influence of one metal on

another at a distance from it, or of one piece of metal on another piece of the same
kind, through the medium of the materials in which they are immersed, and also
for the further study of some of the interesting phenomena mentioned herein.

11. On the Teaching of Chemistry in Elementary Schools.
        By Wm. Lant Caepexter, B.A., B.Sc, F.C.S.

    At a recent meeting of the Physical Society the author brought forward the system
of science demonstration in elementary schools, as practised now for some years in

Liverpool and Birmingham. This paper appeared in full in the midmonthly July

supplement of the ' Journal of Education.' The essence of the system is the employ-
ment of a specially appointed expert, who goes from school to school with his

apparatus, repeating the same lesson in each. The lessons are entirely oi-al ; no
textbooks are used ; and the pupils write notes, which are revised by the demon-
strator. Some of the results of the general system are communicated in a paper to

Section F.

In Birmingham a very good central laboratory has recently been erected, where

the stock of apparatus necessary for the lessons in elementary physics is kept, and

it has also been fitted up for instruction of a somewhat more advanced character in

Aphysics and chemistry.  good deal of usefid work has already been done here

by the advanced pupils, and by some of the teachers, under the supervision of the

senior demonstrator, Mr. W. Jerome Harrison, F.G.S. He has hardly commenced

a general system of instruction in chemistry, analogous to that in physics, since

chemistry for the first time now forms a part of the Government code. His idea of

the proper system, however, is

     1. Attendance of the pupil at a course of elementarj' lectures, well illustrated,
with viva voce examinations at the commencement of each lecture upon the subject of

the preceding one.

   A2. second course, consisting alternately of lectures and experimental work,

the pupil in the latter performing for himself the experiments given in the former.

    These two courses to be confined to the common elements and their com-

pounds.

   A3. third course, mainly experimental, and occupied more or less with the

analysis of simple substances.

    As at present with physics, the first of these courses would not be entered upon

until the pupU had passed the fourth standard in the three Rs. Great importance

is attached by ]Mr. Harrison to the full reproduction of lectures in notes illustrated

by rough sketches of apparatus, &c.

--PKESiDEifT OF THE Section^ Professor W. C. Williamson, LL.D., F.R.S.

               THUESDAT, SEPTEMBER 20.

The President delivered the following Address :

Much of the second decade of my life was spent in tbe practical pursuit of

geology in the field, and throughout most of that period I enjoyed almost daily

intercourse with AVilliam Smith, the father of English Geology ; but in later years

mycircumstances restricted  studies to the Palfeoutological side of the science.

Hence I was anxious that the Council of the British Association shoidd place in

this chair some one more familiar than myself "with the later developments of

geographical geologj'. But my friend, Professor Bonney, failing to recognise the

myforce of     objections, intimated  to  me  that I might  render  some  service  to  the

Association by putting before you a sketch of the present state of our knowledge

of the vegetation of the Carboniferous Age.

     This being a subject respecting which I have formed some definite opinions I

am about to act upon the suggestion. To some this may savour of ' shop-talk.'

But such is often the only talk which a man can indulge in intelligently, and to

close his mouth on his special themes may compel him either to talk nonsense, or

to be silent.

Whilst undertaking this task I am alive to the difficulties which surroimd it

especially those arising from the wide differences of opinion amongst palfeo-

hotanists on some fundamental points. On some of the most important of these

there is a substantial agreement between the English and German palaeontologists.

The dissentients are chiefly, though not exclusively, to be found amongst those of

France who have, in my humble opinion, been unduly influenced by what is iit

--itself a noble motive viz. a strong reverence for the views of their illustrious

teacher, the late Adolphe Brongniart. Such a tendency speaks well for their

hearts, though it may, in these days of rapid scientific progress, seriously mislead

their heads. I shall, however, endeavour to put before you faithfully the views

entertained by my distinguished French friends M. Renault, M. Grand-Eury, and

the Marquis of Saporta, giving, at the same time, what I deem to be good reasons

for not agreeing with them. I believe that many of our disagreements arise

from geological difierences between the French Carboniferous strata and those of

om* own islands. There are some important types of Carboniferous plants that

appear to be much better represented amongst us than in France. Hence we

have, I believe, more abiindant material than the French palaeontologists possess

Wefor arriving at sound conclusions respecting these plants.        have rich mines,

supplying specimens in which the internal organisation is preserved, in Eastern

Lancashu'e and AVestern Yorkshire, Arran, Burntisland, and other scattered

localities. France has equally rich localities at Autun and St. Etienne. But

some important difference exists between these locahties. The French objects are

preserved in an impracticable siliceous matrix, extremely troublesome to work,

except in specimens of small size. Ours, on the other hand, are chiefly embedded

iu a calcareous material which, whilst it preserves the objects in an exquisite

manner, does not prevent our dissecting examples of considerable magnitude. But,
476 BEPORT-- 1883.

besides this, we are much richer in huge Lepidodendroid and Sigillarian trees,

with their  Stigmarian roots, than                                               the  French are                                                       hence we have a vast  mass  of
                                                                                                                                                    ;

material, illustrating the history of these types of vegetation, in which they seem

to he seriously deficient. This fact alone appears to me sufficient to account for

many of the wide differences of opinion that exist between us respecting these trees.

My second difficulty springs out of the imperfect state of our knowledge of the

subject. One prominent cause of this imperfection lies in the state in which our

specimens are found. They are not only too frequently fragmentary, but most of

those fragments only present the external forms of the objects. Now, mere

external forms of fossil plants are somewhat like similarities of sound in the com-

parative study of languages. They are too often unsafe guides. On the other

hand, microscopic internal organisations in the former subjects are like grammatical

identities in the latter one. They indicate deep affinities that promise to guide

the student safely to philosophical conclusions. But the common state in which

our fossil plants are preserved presents a source of error that is positive as well

as negative. Most of those from our coal-measures consist of inorganic shale,

sandstone or ironstone, invested by a very thin layer of structureless coal. The

surface of the inorganic substance is moulded into some special form dependent

upon structural peculiarities of the living plants, which structures were sometimes

external, sometimes internal, and sometimes intermediate ones. Upon this inor-
ganic cast we find the thin film of structureless coal, which, though of organic

origin, is practically as inorganic as the clay or sandstone which it invests ; but

its surface displays specific sculpturings which are apt to be regarded as always

representing the outermost surface of the plant when living, whereas this is not

always the case. That the coally film is a relic of the carbonaceous substance of

the living plant is unquestionable ; but the thinnest of these films are often the sole

remaining representatives of structures that must originally have been many inches,
and in some instances even many feet, in thickness. In such cases most of the

organic material has been dissipated, and what little remains has often been

so reconsolidated as to be merely moulded upon the sculptured inorganic substance

which it covers, hence it affords no information respecting the exterior of the fossil

when a living organism.                                                          myIt is, in  opinion, specimens like these that have

caused the smooth bark of the Calamite to be credited with a fluted surface, and

the Trigonocarpons with a simply triangular exterior and a misleading name, as it

long caused the inorganic casts known as Sternbergioe to be deemed a strange form

of plant that had no representative amongst living types. In other cases the outer-

most surface of the bark is brought into close contact with the corresponding surface

of the internal vascular cylinder. I have a Stigmaria in which the bases of the root-

lets appear to be planted directly upon that cylinder, the whole of the thick inter-

mediate bark having disappeared. In other examples that vascular zone has also

gone. Thus the innermost and outermost surfaces of a cylinder, originally many

inches apart, are, through the disappearance of the intermediate structures, brought

into close approximation. In such cases, leaves and other external appendages

appear to spring directly from what is merely an inorganic cast of the interior of

the pith. I believe that many of our Calamites are in this condition. Such

examples have suggested the erroneous idea that their characteristic longitudinal

--flutings belong to the exterior of the bark.
    Fungi. Entering upon a more detailed review of our knowledge of the

Carboniferous plants, and commencing at the bottom of the scale, we come to

the lowly group of the Fungi, which are unquestionably represented by the Perono-

sporites antiquarius^ of Woi'thington Smith. There seems little reason for

'doubting that this is one of the Phycomycetous Fungi, possibly somewhat allied to

the Saprolegniem                                                                 but since we have, as yet, no evidence respecting its fructification,
                                                                              ;

these exact relationships must, for the present, remain undetermined. So far as I

know, this is the only Fungus satisfactorily proved to exist in the Carboniferous

rocks, unless the Excipulites Neesii of Goeppert and one or two allied forms belong

to the Fungoid eroup. The Polyporites Boimnanni is unquestionably a scale of a

  --Alga. Numerous objects supposed to belong to this family have been discovered

in much older rocks than Carboniferous ones. The subject is a thorny one. That

marine plants of some kind must have existed, simultaneously with the molluscous

and other plant-eating animals of palaeozoic times, is obviously indisputable. But

what those plants were is another question. The widest differences of opinion
Aexist in reference to many of them.
                                         considerable nuuiber of those recognised

by Schimper, Saporta, and other palaeobotanists, are declared by Nathorst to be

merely inorganic tracks of marine animals ; and in the case of many of these I

have little doubt that the Swedish geologist is right. Others have been shown to
be imperfectly preserved fragments of plants of much higher organisation than

Algee ; branches of Conifers even being included amongst them. I have as vet
seen none of Carboniferous age that could be indisputably identified with the

family of Algae, though there are many that look like, and may probably be, such.
The microscope alone can settle this question, though even this instrument tails to

secure unity of opinion  in the case of  Dawson's Protota.vites                                                                                     and no other of  the
                                                                                                                                                 ;

supposed seaweeds, hitherto discovered, have been sufficiently well preserved to bear

the microscopic test ; hence I think that their existence in Carboniferous rocks can
only be regarded as an miproven probability. Mere superficial resemblances do
not satisfy the severe demands of modern science, and probabilities are an in-
sufficient foimdation \ipon which to build evolutionary theories.

Seeing what extremely delicate cell-structures are preserved in the Carboniferous

beds, it cannot appear other than strange that the few imperfect Fungoid relics,

just referred to, constitute the only terrestrial cellular Ciyptogams that have been
discovered in the Carboniferous strata. The Darwinian doctrine would suo-o-est

that these lower forms of plant-life ought to have aboimded in that priiuseval a^e

and that they were capable of being preserved is proved by the numerous specimens
Whymet with in Tertiary deposits.
                                         we do not find such in the Palaeozoic beds is

still an unsolved problem.

   --Vascular Cryptogams. The Vascular Cryptogams, next to be considered, burst

upon us almost suddenly, and in rich profusion, during the Devonian age ; they
are silent equally in the Devonian and Carboniferous strata as to their ancestral

descent.

  --Ferns. The older taxonomic literature of Palaeozoic Fern-life is, with few

exceptions, of little scientific value. Hooker and others have uttered in vain wise
protests against the system that has been pursued. Small fragments have had
generic and specific names assigned to them, with supreme indifference to the
study of morphological variability amongst living types. The undifferentiated
tip of a terminal pinnide has had its special name, whilst the more developed

structures forming the lower part of a frond have supplied two or three more

species. Whilst the distinct forms of the sterile and fertile fronds may have fur-

nished additional ones, a further cause of confusion is seen in the wide difference

existing between a young, half-developed seedling and the same plant at an advanced

stage of its growth. Anyone who has watched the growth of a young Polypo-
dium aureum can appreciate this difierence. Yet, in the early stages of palaeonto-

logical research, obsei-vers could scarcely have acted otherwise than as they did in

assigning names to these fragments, if only for temporary working purposes. Our
error lies in misunderstanding the true value of such names. At present the study

Weof fossil ferns is affording some promise of a newer and healthier condition.

are slowly learning a little about the fructification of some species, and the internal

organisation of others. Such facts, cautiously interpreted, are surer guides than,
mere external contours ; unfortunately, such facts are, as yet, but few in number

and when we have them we are too often unable to identify om' detached

sporangia, stems, and petioles with the fronds of the plants to which they pri-

marily belonged.

     That all the Carboniferous plants included in the genera Pecopteris, Neuropteris
and Sphenopteris are ferns appears to be most probable ; but what the true affini-

ties of the objects included in these ill-defined genera may be is very doubtful.
Here and there we obtain glimpses of a more definite kind. That the Devonian

Palceopteris Hibernica is a Hymenophyllous form appears to be almost certain ·

and, on corresponding grounds, we may conclude that tlie Carboniferous forms,

Sphenopteris trichomanoides, S. Humholtii,'^ and Hymenophyllum Weissii ,- belong to

the same group. The fructification of the two latter leaves little room for doubting

their position, whilst the foliage of some other species of Sphenopteris is sug-

gestive of similar conclusions ; but until their fructitication is discovered this cannot

Anbe determined.  elegant form of Sphenopteris {S. tenella Brong., <S'. lanceolata

of Gutbier), recently described by Mr. Kidson of Stirling, abundantly justifies

caution in dealing with these Sphenopterides. This plant possesses a true Sphenop-

teroid foliage, but its fructification is that of a Marattiaceous Danaicl. The sporangia

are elongated vertically, and have the round terminal aperture of both the recent

--and fossil Danaice a group of plants far removed from the Hymenophyllaceous

type of Sphenopterid ah-eady referred to.

'WTiether or not this Sphenopteris was really ]\Iarattiaceous in other features

than its fructification is uncertain ; but I think that we have indisputably obtained

Mystems and petioles of Marattiace^ from the Carboniferous strata.        friend

M. Renault and I, without being aware of the fact, simultaneously studied

the Medidlosa elegans of Cotta. This plant was long regarded as the stem of a

true Monocotyledon, a decision the accuracy of which was doubted, first by Brong-

niart and afterwards by Binney. M. Renaidt's memoir and my memoir, part vii.

Weappeared almost simidtaneously.  then found that we had alike determined

the supposed Monocotyledon not only to be a fern, but to belong to the peculiarly-

aberrant gTOup of the Marattiacea. As yet we know nothing of its foliage and

fructification.

     M. Grand-Eury has figured ^ a remarkable series of ferns from the coal-

measures of the basin of the Loire, the sporangia of which exhibit marked

resemblances to those of the Marattiaceje. This is especially the case with his

specimens of Asterotheca and Seolecopten's* as also with his Pecojyteris Mm-at-
tiatheca, P. Anr/iotheca, and P. DanaeatJieca but there is some doubt as to the

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

dehiscence of the sporangia of these places ; hence their Marattiaceous character is

not absolutely established.

That the coal-measures contain the remains of arborescent ferns has long been

known, especially from their abundance at Autun. In Lancaslure I have only

met with the stems or petioles of one species preserving their internal organisation.*
The Rev. II. H. Higgins obtained stems that appear to have been tree-ferns from

Ravenhead, in Lancaslure, and it is probable that most of the plants included in
the genera Psaronius, Caidopteris, and Protopten's are also tree-ferns.

     There yet remains another remarkable group of ferns, the sporangia of which
are known to us through the researches of M. Renault. In these the fertile
pinnules are more or less completely transmuted into small clusters of oblong
sporangia. In one case M. Renault believes that he has identified these organs

·with a stem or petiole of a type not uncommon at Oldham and Halifax, belonging
to Corda's genus Zygopteris. Renault has combined this with some others to

constitute his group of Patryopteridees, an altogether extinct and generalised type.

Tliis review shows that whilst fonns identifiable with the Hyinenophyllacecu and

Marattiacees existed in the Carboniferous epoch, and we find here and there traces

of affinities with some other more recent types, most of the Carboniferous ferns
are generalised primreval forms, which only became differentiated into later ones

during the slow progress of time.

when Brongnlart separated the plants contained in the group into two divisions
one of which (^Equisetacees) he identified with the living Equisetums, and the
other {Asterophyllitees} he regarded as being Gymnospermous Dicotyledons. To

Schimper helongs the merit, as I believe it to be, of steadily resisting this
division ; nevertheless, palseobotanists are still separated into two schools on the
subject ; Eenault, Grand-Eury, and Saporta adhere more or less closely to the
Brongniartian idea, whilst the British and German paleontologists have always

rejected the idea that any of these plants were other than Cryptogams.

   A fundamental feature of the entire group is seen in their foliar appendages,

which, however morphologically and physiologically modified, are arranged in
nodal verticils. This appears to be the only characteristic which the plants possess

in common.
     Calamites and Calamodendvon. In his ' Prodrome ' (1828), and in his later

' Vegetaux Fossiles,' Brongniart adopted the former of these generic names as
previously employed by Suckow, Schlotlieim, Sternberg, and Artis. It was only
in his ' Tableavi des Genres de Vegetaux Fossiles ' (Dictionnaire xmiversel d'Histoire
Naturelle, 1849) that he divided the genus, introducing the name of Calamodendron

Ato represent what he believed to be the Gymnospermous division of the group.

long series of investigations, extending over many years, has convinced me that no

such Gymnospermous type exists.* The same conclusion has more recently been

arrived at by Vom c. M. D. Stur,^ after studj-ing many continental examples in

--which structure is preserved. AVhat I regard as an error appears to have had an

intelligible origin the fertile source of similar errors in other groups.

     Nearly all the Calamitean fossils found hi shales and sandstones consist of an
inorganic, superficially fluted substance, coated over with a thin film of structure-

less coal. (See Histoire des Vegetaux Fossiles, Vol. i., PI. 22), the latter being
exactly moulded upon and 7-etaimng the outlines of the inorganic fluted cast that

undej-lies it. Brongniart and those who adopt his views, believe that the external

surface of this coal-film exactly represents the corresponding external surface of

the original plant. Hence the conclusion was arrived at that the plant had a very
large central fistidar cavity, surrounded by a very thin layer of cellular and vascular

tissues, as in some living Equisetums. On the otlier hand, Brongniart also
obtained some specimens of what he primarily believed to be Calamites, in

which the central pith was surrounded by a thick layer of vascular tissue arranged
in radiating laminated wedges, separated bj' medullary rays. The Exogenous struc-

ture of this vascular zone was too obvious to escape his practised eye. But, not
supposing it possible that any Cryptogam could possess a cambium-layer and an
Exogenous mode of development, Brongniart came to the conclusion that whilst the

thin-walled specimens foimd in the shales and sandstones were true Equisetacece,

those with the thick woody cylinders were Exogens of another type. His conclusion
that they were Gymuosperms was a purely hypothetical one, justified by no one

featm'e of their organisation.

    My researches, based upon a vast number of specimens of all sizes, from minute

twigs, little more than the thirtieth of an inch in diameter, to thick stems at least

thirteen inches across, soon led me to the conclusion that we have but one type of

Calamite ; and that the differences which misled Brongniart are merely due to

variations in the mode of their preservation.^ It became clear to me that the

outer surface of the coaUy film in the specimens preserved in the shales and sand-

stones, did not represent the outer surface of the living plant, but was only a
fractional remnant of the original carbon of that plant which had imdergone a
complete metamorphosis ; the greater part of what primarily existed had dis-
appeared, probably in a gaseous state ; and the little that remained, displaying no
organic structure, had been moulded upon the underlying inorganic cast of the
medullary cavity. This oast is always fluted longitudinally and constricted trans-
versely at intervals of varying lengths. Both these features were due to impres-

sions made by the organism upon the inorganic sand or mud introduced into the

medullary cavity whilst it was in a plastic state, butr which plastic material subse-

quently became more or less hardened ; its longitudinal prrooves being caused by the
pressure of the inner angles of the numerous longitudinal vascidar wedges, and

the transverse ones, partly by the remains of a celhdar nodal diaphragm which

crossed the fistular medullary cavity, and partly by a centripetal encroachment of

the vascular zone at each corresponding point,'

    My cabinets contain an enormous number of sections of these plants in which

the minutest details of their organisation are exquisitely preserved. These specimens,

as already observed, show their structure in every stage of their growth, from the

minutest twigs to stems more than a foot in diameter. Yet these various exaniples

are all, without a solitary exception, constructed upon one common plan. That

plan ia an extremely complicated one ; far too complex to make it in the slightest
degree probable that it could co-exist in two such very different orders of plants

as  the Eqiiisetaceff:  and  the  Gi/mnosperma                                                           j-et, though  very complex, it is, even

in many of its minuter details, unmistakably the plan upon which the living

Equisetums are constructed. The resemblances are too clear as well as too

remarkable, in my mind, to leave room for any doubt on this point. The great

differences are only such as necessarily resulted from the gradual attainment of the

arborescent form, so unlike the lowly herbaceous one of their living representatives.

mOn the other hand, no living Gymnosperm possesses an organisation that any

solitary feature resembles that of the so-called Oalamodendra. The two have

absolutely  nothing     in  common                                      hence the                        conclusion that these Oalamodendra

were Gymnospermous plants, is as arbitrary an assumption as could possibly be

forced upon science ; an assumption that no arguments derived from the merely

external aspects of structureless specimens could ever induce me to accept.

    These Calamitos exhibit a remarkable morphological characteristic which

{presents itself to us here for the first time, but which we shall find recurs in other

'alseozoic forms. Some of our French botanical friends group the various

structures contained in plants into several ^ Appareih,' '^ distinguished by the

functions which those structures have to perform. Amongst others we find the

' Appareil de soutieiu ' embracing those hard woody tissues which may be regarded

as the supporting skeleton of the plant, and the ' Appareil conducteur ' which M.

Van Tieghem describes as composed of two tissues : ' Le tissu cribl6 qui transporte

essentiellement les matiferes insolubles, et le tissu vasculaire qui conduit I'eau et les

substances dissoutes.' AVithout discussing the scientific limits of this definition,

myit sutlices for       present purpose. In nearly all flowering plants these two

' Appareils ' are more or less blended. The supporting wood cells are intermingled,

in varying degrees, with the sap-conducting vessels. It is so even in the lower

Gymnosperms, and in the higher ones these wood-cells almost entirely replace the

vessels. It is altogether otherwise with the fossil Cryptogams. The vascular

cylinder in the interior of the Calamites, for example, consists wholly of barred

vessels, a slight modification of the scalariform type so common in all Cryptogams.

No trace of the ' Appareil desnufiens' is to be found amongst them. The vessels

are, in the most definite sense, the ' Appareils condudeurs ' of these plants ; no such

absolutely undifliTentiated unity of tissue is to be found in the vascular portions of

any living plants other than Cryptogams.

in the roof of the Moorside colliery near Ashton-under-Lyne by Mr. George Wild,

the verj' intelligent manager of that and some neighbounng collieries. The

flattened specimen ran obliquely along the roof, each of its two extremities

passing out of sight by burying themselves in the opposite sides of the mine. Yet

the portion which we measured was 30 feet long, its diameter being 6 inches at

one end, and 4j^ inches at the other. The mean length of its internodes at its
Hbroader end was 3 inches, and at its narrower one

of judging, but the true diameter of the cylinder represented by the fossil when

uncompres.sed has been only 4 inches at one end of the 30 feet, and 2^ inches at

the otlier. Whatever its entire diameter when liviiifr, the vascular cylinder of

this stem must have been at once tall and slender, and consequently must have

required some ^Appareil de soutien,' such as its exogenous vascular zone did not

supply. This was provided, in a very early stage of growth, by the introduction

of a second cambium-layer into the bark ; which, though reminding us of tha

cork-cambium in ordinary Exogenous stems, produced, not cork, but prosenchy-

matous cells.' In its youngest state the bark of the C'alamites was a very loose

cellular ])arenchyma, but in the older stems most of this parencliyma became

enclosed in the prosenchymatous tissue referred to, which appears to have con-
stituted the greater portion of the matured bark. The sustaining skeleton of

the plant, therefore, was a hollow cylinder developed centrifugally on the inner

side of an enclosing cambium-zone. That this cambium-zone must, in matured

stems, have had some protective periderm external to it is obvious; but I have not

Weyet discovered what it was like.  shall find a similar cortical provision for sup-

porting lofty ( 'ryptogamous stems in the Lepidodendrci and >Sif/tllm-i(e.

The Carboniferous rocks have furnished a large number of plants having their

foliage arranged in verticib, and which have had a variety of geuei'ic names assigned

to them ; such are Asteroplnjllit.es, Spheiiophyllum, Atinulana, Jiechcro, Ilippurites,
and Schizoneura. Of these genera, Sphenophyllum is distinguished by the small

number of its wedge-shaped leaves, and the structure of its stems has been de-

scribed by M. Renault. Annulnria is a peculiar form in which the leaves forming

each verticil, instead of being all planted at the same angle upon the central stem,

are flattened obliquely nearly in the plane of the stem itself. AsterophijUkes differs
from Sphenop/ii/llum, chiefly in the larger number and in the linear form of its

leaves. Some stems of this type have virtually the same structure- as those of

Sphcnfiphyllum, a structure whicli difier.s widely from that of the Calamites, and of

which, consequently, these plants cannot constitute the leaf-bearing branches. But

there is little doubt that true Calamitean branches have been included in the genus

Ast.ei-uphyllites ; I have specimens, for which I am indebted to Dr. Dawson, which

mjI should unhesitatingly have designated Asia-op/ii/Uiteg, but for  friend's positive

statement that he detached them from stems of a (Jalamite. Of the internal organisa-
tion of the stems of the other genera named, we know nothing.

It is a remarkable fact that, notwithstanding the number of young Calami-

tean shoots obtained from Oldliam and Halifax, in which all the tissues are

preserved, we have not met with one with attached leaves. This is apparently
Wedue to the fact that most of the specimens are decorticated.
                                                                            have a suffi-

cient number of corticated specimens to show us what the bark was, but such

specimens are very rare. They clearly prove, however, that their bark had a

smooth, and not a furrowed, external surface.

There yet remain for consideration the numerous reproductive strobili, gene-
Werally regarded as belonging to plants of this class of Equwetince.
                                                                            find some of

these strobili associated with stems and foliage of known types, as in fiphmophyllum^

but we know nothing of the internal organisation of these Sphenophylloid strobili.

We have strobili connected with stems and foliage of Anntdaria* but we are equally

ignorant of the organisation of these ; so far as that organisation can be ascer-

tained from Sterzel's specimen, it seems to have alternating sterile and fertile bracts,

with the sporangia of the latter arranged in fours, as in Ccdamostachys.^ On the

other hand, we are now very familiar with the structure of the ddmnostachys

Binneana, the prevalent strobilus in the calcareous nodules found in the lower

coal-measures of Lancashire and Yorkshire. It has evidently been a sessile spike,

the axial structures of whicli were trimerous ^ (rarely tetramerous), having a cellular

medulla in its centre. Its appendages were exact multiples of those numhers.

Of the plant to which it belonged, we know nothing. On the other hand, we have

examples, supposed to be of the same genus, as C. jmniculata,- and C. iwh/stnchya,^

united to stems with Asterophyllitean leaves, but whether or not these fruits had

the organisation of C. Binneana, we are unable to say.

   We are also acquainted with the structure of the two fruits belonging to the

genera Bruchnannia * and VolhnanniaJ' This latter term has long been very

vaguely applied.

There still remain the genera Stachannularia, Paleeostachja, Macrostachya,

Cinyularia, Huttonia, and Calamitina, all of which have the phyllomes of their

strobili, fertile and sterile, arranged in verticils, and some of them display Astero-

phyllitean foliage. But these plants are only known from structureless impressions.

That all these curious spore-bearing oi'ganisms have close affinities with the large

group of the Equisetums, cannot be regarded as certain, but several of them un-

doubtedly have peculiarities of structure suggestive of relations with the Calamites.

This is especially observable in the longitudinal canals found in the ceniral axis of

some types, apparently identical with what I liave designated the internodal canals

of the Calamites.'' The position and structure of their vascular bundles suggest the

same relationship, whilst in many the positions of the sporangia and sporangio-

phores are eminently Equisetiform. Renault's Bruchnannia Grand-Euryi and

B. Decaisnei, as well as a strobilus whicli I described in 1870,^ exhibit these Oala-

mitean affinities very distinctly.

One strobilus which I described in 1880 ^ must not be overlooked. As is well

Weknown, all the living forms of Equlsetaceous plants are isosporous.  only

MyIthi::ocarpce.  strobilus is identical in every detailed feature of its organisation

·with the common CalamostacJiys Binneana, excepting that it is heterosporous,

having microspores in its upper and macrospores in its lower part ; a state of

things suggestive of some link between the Equisetince and the heterosporous

Lycopodiacecv.

  --Lycojyodiacea;. This branch of vaj subject suggests memories of a long conflict

which, though virtually over, still leaves, here and there, the ground-swell of a

stormy past. At the meeting of the British Association at Liverpool, in 1870,

I first announced that a thick, secondary, exogenous growth of vascular tissue

existed in the stems of many Carboniferous Oryptogamic plants, especially in the

Calamitean and Lepidodendroid forms. But, at that time, the ideas of M. Brongniart

were so entirely in the ascendant, that my notions were rejected by every botanist

present. Though the illustrious French palaeontologist knew that such growths

existed in Siyillarioi and in what he designated Calamodendra, he concluded that,

de facto, such plants could not be Cryptogams. Time, however, works wonders.

--Evidence has gradually accumulated proving that with the conspicuous exception
--of the ferns nearly every Carboniferous Cryptogam was capable of developing such

zones of secondary growth. The exceptional position of the ferns still appears to

be as true as it was when I first proclaimed their exceptional character at Liverpool.
At that time I was imder the impression that the secondary wood was only de-

veloped in such plants as attained to arboreal dimensions, but I soon afterwards

     ^ It is an interesting fact that transverse sections of the strobili of Lycopodium
Alpinum exhibit a somewhat similar trimerous arrangement, though differing widely

in the positions of its sporangia.

discovered that it occurred equally in many small plants like Sphenophyllum, Astero-

phyllites and other more diminutive types.

     After thirteen years of persevering demonstration, these views, at first so
strongly opposed, have found almost universal acceptance. Nevertheless, there

still remain some few who believe them to be erroneous. In the later stages of

this discussion the botanical relations subsisting between Lejndodendron, Sigillaria,

and Stigmaria have been the chief themes of debate. In this country we regard the

conclusion that Stigmaria is not only a root, but the root alike of Lejndodendron

and Sigillaiia, as settled beyond all dispute. Nevertheless M. Renault and M.
Grand-Eury believe that it is frequently a leaf-bearing rhizome, from which

aerial stems are sent upwards. I am satisfied that there is not a shadow of founda-

tion for such a belief. The same authors, along with their distinguished country-

man, the Marquis of Saporta, believe, with Brongniart, that it is possible to sepa-
rate Siyillai-ia widely from Lejndodendron, They leave the latter plant amongst

the Lycopods, and elevate the former to the rank of a Gymnospermous Exogen. I
have demonstrated in vain the existence of a large series of specimens of the same
species of plant, young states of which display all the essential features of structure
which they believe to characterise Lepidodendron, whUst in its progress to matu-

rity, every stage in the development of the secondary wood, regarded by them as

characteristic of a Sigillaria, can be followed step by step.' Nay, more: my cabi-

net contains specimens of young dichotomously branching twigs, in which one of
the two diverging branches has only the centripetal cylinder of the Lepidodendron,

whilst the other has begun to develop the secondary wood of the Sigillaria."

     The distinguished botanist of the Institut, Professor Ph. vanTieghem, has recently

paid some attention to the conclusions adopted by his three countrymen in this

controversy, and has made an important advance upon those conclusions, in what

I believe to be the right direction. He recognises the Lycopodiaceous character of

the  Sigillaria,  and then.- close relations to the Lepidodendra ^                                                                                                                                                                                                       and he also accepts

my demonstration of the unipolar, and consequently Lycopodiaceous, character of

the fibro-vascular bundle of the Stigmarian rootlet, a peculiarity of structure of

which M. Renault has hithero denied the existence. But, along with these recog-

nitions of the accuracy of my conclusions, he gives fresh currency to several of the

old errors relating to parts of the subject to which he has not yet given personal

attention. Thus he considers that the Sigillarice., though closely allied to the-

Lepidodendra, are distinguished from them by possessing the power of developing

the centrifugal or exogenous zone of vascidar tissue already referred to. He charac-

terises the Lepidodendra as having ' un seid bois centripete,' notwithstandmg the ab-

solute demonstrations to the contrary contained in my Memoir xi. Dealing with-

the root of Sigillaria, which in Great Britain at least is the well-known Stigmaria

Jicoides, following Renault, he designates it a ' rhizome,^ limiting the term root

to what we designate the rootlets. He says, 'Le rhizome des Sigillaires a la
meme structure que la tige aerienne, avec des bois primaires tantot isoles a la

Peripherie de la moelle, tantot  confluents  au  centre et en un axe                                                                                                                                                                                                     plein                            seulement
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

les fasceaux libero-ligneux secondaires y sont separes par de plus larges rayons,' &c.
    Now, Stigmaria being a root, and not a rhizome, contains no representative of

the primary wood of the stem. This latter is, as even M. Brongniart so correctly

pointed out long ago, the representative of the medidlary sheath, and the fibro-vas-

cular bundles which it gives off are all foliar ones, as is the case with the bundles

given off by this sheath in all Exogenous plants. But in the Lepidodendra and

Sigillarice, as in all living exogens, it is not prolonged into the root. In the latter,

as might be expected ajirim-i, we only find the secondary, or exogenous, vascular zone.
Having probably the largest collection of sections of Stigmarice in the world, I speak
unhesitatingly on these points. M. van Tieghem further says, ' La tige aerienne part
d'un rhizome rameux tres-developpe nomm6 Stigmaria, sur lequel s'inserent a la fois

de petites feuilles et des racines parfois dichotomees.' I have yet to see a solitary

fact justifying the statement that leaves are intermingled with the rootlets of

Stigmaria. The statement rests upon an entire misinterpretation of sections of the
fibro-vascular bundles supplying those rootlets and an ignorance of the nature and
positions of the rootletst, hemselves. More than forty years have elapsed since

John Eddowes Bowman first demonstrated that the Sfigmarics were true roots, and

every subsequent British student has confirmed Bowman's accurate determination.
     M. Lesquereux informs me that his American experiences have convinced him

that Suiillaria is Lycopodiaceous. Dr. Dawson has now progressed so far in the
same direction as to believe that there exists a series of Sigillarian forms, which

link the Lepidodendra on the one hand ^\-ith the Gytunospermous exogens on the

other. As an evolutionist I am prepared to accept the possibility that such links
may exist. They certainly do, so far as the union of Lepidodendron with Siffillaria

is concerned. I have not yet seen any from the higher part of this chain that are

absolutely satisfactory to me, but Dr. Dawson thinks that he has found such. I
may add that Schimper, and the younger German school, have always associated
Sigillaria with the Lycopodiacete. But there are yet other points under discussion

connected with these fossil Lycopods.
     M. Renault affirms that some forms of Halonia are subterranean rhizomes, and

the late Mr. Biuney believed that HaJonim were the roots of Lepidodendron. I

am not acquainted" with a solitary fact justifying either of these suppositions,

and unhesitatingly reject them. "NVe have the clearest evidence that some Halonia
at least are true terminal, and, as I believe, strobilus-bearing, branches of
various Lepidodendroid plants; and I see no reason whatever for separating

Halonia regidaris from those whose fruit-bearing character is absolutely deter-
mined. Its branches, like the others, are covered throughout their entire
circumference, and in the most regularly symmetrical manner, with leaf-scars, a

feature wholly incompatible with the idea of the plant Ijeing either a root or a
rhizome. M. Renault has been partly led astray in this matter by misinterpreting
a figure of a specimen published by the late Mr. Binney. That specimen being

now in the museum of Owens College, we are able to demonstrate that it has

none of the features which M. Renault assigns to it.
     The large round or oval, distichously-arranged, scars of Ulodendron have long

stimulated discussion as to their nature. This, too, is now a well-understood

matter. Lindley and Hutton long ago suggested that they were scars whence cones
had been detached ; a conclusion which was subsequently sustained by Dr. Dawson

and Schimper, and which structural evidence led me also to support.' The
matter was set at rest by Mr. d'Arcy Thompson's discovery of specimens with the

strobili in situ. Only a small central part of the conspicuous cicatrix character-
ising the genus represented the area of organic imion of the cone to the stem.
The greater part of that cicatrix has been covered with foliage, which, owing to
the shortness of the cone-bearing branch, was compressed by the base of the cone.

The large size of many of these biserial cicatrices on old stems, has been due to the

considerable growth of the stem subsequently to the fall of the cone.

     Our knowledge of the terminal branches of the large-ribbed Sigillariee is still
very imperfect. Palaeontologists who have urged the separation of the Sigillariee
from the Lepidodendra have attached weight to the difference between the
longitudinally-ridged and furrowed external bark of the former plants, along which
ridges the leaf-scars are disposed in vertical lines, and the diagonally-arranged
scars of Lepidodendron. They have also dwelt upon the alleged absence of
branches from the Sigillarian stems. I think that their mistake, so far as the
branching is concerned, has arisen from their expectation that the branches must
necessarily have had the vertically-grooved appearance and the longitudinal
arrangement of the leaf-scars, observed in the more aged trimks ; hence they
have probably seen the branches of Sigillariee without recognising them. _ I believe
this to have been the case. I further entertain the belief that the transition from

the vertical phyllotaxis, or leaf-arrangement, of the Sigillarian leaf-scars, to the
diagonal one of the Lepidodendra, will ultimately be found to be efiiected through

the sub-genus Famlaria, in many forms of which this diagonal arrangement be-

comes quite as conspicuous as the yertical one. This is the case even in Brongniart's

classic specimen of Sigillaria elegans, long the only fragment of that genus known
which retained its internal structure. The fact is, the shape of the leaf-scars, as

well as the degree of their proximity to each other, underwent great changes as

Lepidodendroid and Sigillarian stems advanced from youth to age. Thus Presl's genus

Bergeria was hased on forms of Lepidodendroid scars which we now find on most of

the terminal branches of unmistakable Lejndodendra} The phyllotaxis oi Sif/illaria,

of the type of *S'. occulata, passes b}' imperceptible gradations into that of

Favularia. In many young branches the leaves were densely crowded together

but the exogenous development of the interior of the stem, and its consequent

growth both in length and thickness, pushed these scars apart at the same time

Wethat it increased their size and altered their shape.  see precisely the same

effects produced by the same causes upon the large fruit-scars of Ulodendron. The

Carboniferous Lycopods were mostly arborescent, but some few dwarf forms,

apparently like the modern Selcu/inellw, have been found in the Saarbriicken coal-

fields. Many of the arborescent forms, if not all, produced secondary wood, by means

of a cambium layer, as they increased in age. In the case of some of them '^ this

was done in a very rudimentary manner, nevertheless sufficiently so to demonstrate

what is essential to the matter, viz. the existence of a cambium layer producing a

centrifugal growth of secondary vascular tissue.

As already pointed out in the case of the Calamites, the vascidar axis of these

Lepidodendra was purely an appareil conducteur, unmixed with any wood-cells

hence the njjpareil de soiitien had to be supplied elsewhere. This was done in the

same way as in the Calamites: a thick, persistent, hypodermal zone of meristem^

developed a layer of prismatic prosenchyma of enormous thiclmess,* which encased

Wethe softer structures in a strong cylinder of self-supporting tissue.  have positive

evidence that the fructitication of many of these plants was in the form of

heterosporous strobili. Whether or not such was the case with all these Lepidostrobi
we are yet unable to determine. But the incalculable myriads of their macrospores,

seen in so many coals, afford clear evidence that the heterosporous types must have

preponderated vastly over all others.

   --Gtjmnosperms. Our knowledge of this part of the Carboniferous vegetation

has made gi-eat progress during the last thirty years. This progress began with my

own discovery ^ that all our British Dado.rylons possessed what is termed a discoid
pith, such as we see in the white Jasmine, some of the American hickories, and

several other plants. At the same time I demonstrated that most of our objects

hitherto known as Artisids and Sternbei-gias were merely inorganic casts of these

discoid medullary cavities. Further knowledge of the genus JJadoxylon seems to

suggest that it was not only the oldest of the true Conifers in point of time, but also

--one of the lowest of the coniferous types.
     Cycads. The combined labours of Grand-Euiy, Brongniart, and Renault have

revealed the unexpected predominance, in some localities, of a primitive but varied

type of Cycadean vegetation. Observers have long been familiar with certain seeds

known as Trigonocaipons and Caidiocarpons, and with large leaves to which the

name of Noeggerathia was given by Sternbei'g. All these seeds and leaves have

been tossed from family to family at the caprice of different classifiers, but in all

cases without much knowledge on which to base their determinations. The rich

mass of material disinterred by M. Grand-Eury at St. Etienne, and studied by

486 KEPOKT-- 1883.

Brongniart and M. Eenault has thrown a flood of light upon some of these ohjects,
which now prove to be primjeval types of Cjcadean vegetation.

     Mr. Peach's discovery of a specimen demonstrating that the Antholithes Pit-
cairnicB ^ of Lindley and Hutton was not only, as these authors anticipated, ' the
inflorescence of some plant/ but that its seeds were the well-known Cardiocarpons,

was the first lint in an important chain of new evidence. Then followed the rich

discoveries at St. Etienne, where a profusion of seeds, displaying wonderfully their
internal organisation, was brought to light by the energy of M. Grand-Eury, which

seeds M. Brongniart soon pronounced to be Cycadean. At the same time I was
obtaining many similar seeds from Oldham and Burntisland, in which also the
minute organisation was preserved. Dawson, Newberry, and Lesquereux have also
shown that many species of similar seeds, though retaining no traces of internal

structure, occur in the coal-measures of North America.
     Equally important was the further discovery, by M. Grand-Eury, that the

Antholithes, with their Cardiocarpoid seeds, were but one form of the monoclinous

catkin-like inflorescences of the Noegyerathicp, now better known by Unger's name

--of Cordnites. These investigations suggest some important conclusions: 1st. The

vast number and variety of these Cycadean seeds, as well as the enormous size of
some of them, is remarkable, showing the existence of an abundant and important
Carboniferous vegetation, of most of which no trace has yet been discovered other
than these isolated seeds. 2nd. Most of the seeds exhibit the morphological pecu-
liarity of having a large cavity (the " cavite pollinique ' of Brongniart) between
the upper end of the nucelle and its investing episperm, and immediately below the
micropile of the seed. That this cavity was destined to have the pollen grains diawn
into it, and be thus brought into direct connection with the apex of the nucelle, is
shown by the various examples in which such grains are still found in that cavity."
3rd. M. Grand-Eiu'y has shown that some of his forms of Cordaites possessed the
discoid or Sternbergian pith which I had previously found in Dadoxylon ; and,

lastly, these Cordaites prove that a diclinous form of vegetation existed at this
early period in the history of the flowering plants, but whether in a monoecious

or a dioecious form we have as yet no means of determining. Their reproductive
structures differ widely from the true cones borne by most Oycads at the present

day.

   --Conifers. It has long been remarked that few real cones of Conifers have

hitherto been found in the Carboniferous rocks, and I doubt if any such have yet

been met with. Large quantities of the woody stems now known as Dadoxylons

have been found both in Europe and America. These stems present a true coni-

ferous structure both in the pith, medullary sheath wood, and bark.^ The wood

presents one very peculiar feature. Its. foliar bundles, though in most other
respects exactly like those of ordinary Conifers, are given oft', not singly, but in
pairs.* I have only found this arrangement of double foliar bundles in the (Jhinese
Gingko {Salishuria adianiifolui).^ This fact is not unimportant when connected
with another one. Sir Joseph Hooker long ago expressed his opinion that the
well-known Trigonocarpons "^ of the coal measures "n^ere the seeda of a Conifer allied
to this Salishuria. The abundance of the fragments of Dadoxylon, combined with the
readiness with which cones and seeds are preserved in a fossil state, make it pro-
bable that the fruits belonging to these woody stems would be so preserved. But

of cones we find no trace, and, as we discover no other plant in the Carboniferous

strata to which the Trigonocarpons could with any probability have belonged, these
facts afford grounds for associating them with the Dadoxylons. These combined
reasons, viz. the structure of the stems with their characteristic foliar bundles, and
the Gingko-like character of the seeds, suggest the probability that these Dadoxylons,

the earliest of known Conifers, belonged to the Taxinece, the lowest of these coni-
ferous types, and of which the living Salisburia may perhaps be regarded as the least

advanced form.

Thus far our attention has been directed only to plants whose affinities have

been ascertained with such a degree of probability as to make them available
witnesses, so far as they go, when the question of vegetable evolution is sub
judice. But there remain others, and probably equally important ones, respecting
which we have yet much to learn. In most cases we have only met with detached

portions of these plants, such as stems or reproductive structures, neither of

which are we able to connect with their other organs. The minute tissues of

these  plants                           are    preserved     in  an  exquisite  degree  of perfection                                                               hence  we  can

affirm that, whatever they may be, they differ widely from every living type that

we are acquainted with. The exogenous stems or branches from Oldham and

Halifax which I described under the name of Astromyelon,^ and of which a much

myfuller description will be found in                                     forthcoming Memoir xii., belonn- to a

plant of this description. The remarkable conformation of its bark obviously

indicates a plant of more or less aquatic habits, since it closely resembles those

of Myriophylliuii, Marsilea, and a number of other aquatic plants belonging to
various classes. But its general features suggest nearer affinities to the latter

genus than to any other, Another very characteristic stem is the Hetcrangium

Grievii,- only found in any quantity at Burntisland, but of which we have recently

obtained one or two small specimens at Halifax. This plant displays an abun-

dant supply of primary, isolated, vascular bundles, surrounded by a very feeble

development of secondary vascular tissue. Still more remarkable is the Ly-

f/inodendron Ohlhamium,^ a stem not uncommon at Oldham, and occasionally

found at Halifax. Unlike the Ileteranyinm, its primary vascular elements are

feeble, but its tendency to develope secondary zylem is very characteristic of the

Anplant.                                equally peculiar feature is seen in the outermost layer of its cellular

bark, which is intersected by innumerable longitudinal lamina) of prosenchy-

matous tissue, arranged in precisely the same way as is the hard bast in the
Lime and similar trees, atlbrding another example of the introduction into the

outer bark of the ajijiareil de suutien. As might have been anticipated from this

addition to the bark, this plant attained arborescent dimensions, very large frag-

ments of sandstone casts of the exterior surface of its bark * being very abundant in

most of the leading English coal-fields. Corda also figured such a cast ^ from Eadnitz,

confounding it, however, with his Lepidodendroid Sayenaria fusiformis, with which

it has no true affinity. Of the smaller plants of which we know the structure but

cellular                                hence  they  cannot  be  spores.  Becoming filled with free cells, which

that they are reproductive structures. Dr. Dawson has recently supplied me with

some similar bodies, also containing cells, from the Devonian beds of North

and South America. Except in callmg attention to some slight resemblance exist-

ing between my objects and the sporangiocarps of Pilularia,^ I have formed no

opinion respecting their nature. Dr. Dawson has pointed out that his speci-
mens also are suggestive of relations with the Rhizocarpse.

been made to constiuct a genealogical tree of the vegetable kingdom. That the

Cryptogams and Gymnosperms made their appearance, and continued to flourish

on this earth, long prior to the appearance of the Monocotyledonous and Dicoty-

ledonous flowering plants, is at all events a conclusion justified by our present

knowledge so far as it goes. Every one of the supposed Palms, Aroids and

other Monocotyledons has now been ejected from the lists of Carboniferous

plants, and the Devonian rocks are equally devoid of them. The generic rela-

tions of the Carboniferous vegetation to the higher flowering plants found in the

newer strata have no light thrown upon them hj these Palfeozoic forms. These

latter do afford us a few plausible hints respecting some of their Cryptogamic

and Gymnospermous descendants, and we know that the immediate ancestors of
many of them flourished during the Devonian age, but here our knowledge practi-

cally ceases. Of their still older genealogies scarceh' any records have been dis-

covered. When the registries disappeared, not only had the grandest forms of

Cryptogamic life that ever lived attained their hisrhest development, but even the

more lordly Gymnosperms had become a widely diffused and flourishing race. If

there is any truth in the doctrine of evolution, and especially if long periods

of time were necessary for a world-wide development of lower into higher races,

a terrestrial vegetation must have existed during a vast succession of epochs

ere the noble Lycopods began their prolonged career. Long prior to the Carboni-

ferous age they had not only made this beginning, but during that age they had

diflfused themselves over the entire earth. AVe find them equally in the old world
Weand in the new.
                   discover them from amid the ice-clad rocks of Bear Island

and Spitzbergen to Brazil and New South AVales. Unless we are prepared to

concede that they were simultaneously developed at these remote centres, we must

recognise the incalculable amount of time requisite to spread them thus from their

birth-place, wherever that may have been, to the ends of the earth. Whatever may

have been ihe case with the southern hemisphere, we have also clear evidence that

in the northern one much of this wide distribution must have been accomplished
prior to the Devonian age. What has become of this pre-Devonian flora ? Some

contend that the lower cellular forms of plant life wei"e not preserved because their

delicate tissues were incapable of preservation. But why should this be the case ?
Such plants are abundantly preserved in Tertiary strata, why not equally in Paljeo-

zoic ones / The explanation must surely be sought, not in their incapability of being

preserved, but in the operation of other causes. But the Carboniferous rocks throw

another impediment in the way of constructors of these genealogical trees. Whilst

Carboniferous plants are found at hundreds of separate locahties, widely distributed

over the globe, the number of spots at which these plants are found displaying any

internal structure, is extremely few. It would be difficult to enumerate a score

of such spots. Yet each of those favoured localities has revealed to us forms of

plant life of which the ordinary plant-bearing shales and sandstones of the same

localities sliow no traces. It seems, therefore, that whilst there was a general

resemblance in the mere conspicuous forms of Carboniferous vegetation from the

Arctic circle to the extremities of the southern hemisphere, each locality had

special forms that flourished in it either exclusively or at least abundantly, whilst

rare elsewhere. It would be easy, did time allow, to give many proofs of the

truth of this statement. Our experiences at Oldham and Halifax, at Arran and

Burntisland, at St. Etienne and Autun, alike tell us that such is the case. If these

few spots which admit of being searched by the aid of the microscope have

recently revealed so many hitherto unknown treasures, is it not fair to conclude

that corresponding novelties would have been furnished by all the other plant-

producing localities if these plants had been preserved in a state capable of being

similarly investigated ? I have no doubt about this matter ; hence I conclude that

there is a vast variety of Carboniferous plants of which we have as yet seen no

traces, but every one of which must have played some part, hov.-ever humble, in

the development of the plant races of later ages. AVe can only hope that time

will bring these now hidden witnesses into the hands of future palaeontologists.

Meanwhile, though far from wishing to check the construction of any legitimate

hypothesis calculated to aid scientific inquiry, I would remind every too ambitious

student that there is a haste that retards rather than promotes progress; that
arouses opposition rather than produces conviction, and that injures the cause
of science by discrediting its advocates.

     The following Papers and Reports were read :

  1. Notes on Geological Sections within Forty Miles Radius of Southport.^

                              By C. E. De UkiiCE, F.G.S.

     The sections in Silurian works of the Lake District and North Wales within the

radius are described, also those in the Carboniferous limestone. Coal Measures, the

Permian and the Triassic rocks, especially the Keuper sandstones and marls around
Southport. The sections in the glacial drilt of \^'est Lancashire and Cheshire
are mentioned, and the sequence and character of the overlying post-glacial heds.
Southport is built upon blown sand, lesting on peat, which is 79 feet below the
surface at the sea-coast, rising inland to the surface ; the whole series rests on
the Keuper marls, which have been bored into to a depth of 187 yards at the
Palace Hotel, Birkdale, without finding the base. Fragments of gypsum and pseudo-
morphous crystals of salt occurred in the boring. The sections in the Mersey

tunnel, now in course of constniction, were alluded to.

2. Section across the Trias recently exposed hy a railway excavation in

                        Liverpool. By G. H. Mokton, F.G.8.

     During the last eight years a very important section of the Triassic strata has
been exposed in Liverpool by excavations for widening the line of the London and
North-Western Railway Company. The section presents a solid wall of sandst'ine

on both sides of the new railway-cutting from Lime Street Station to Edge Hill
Station, a distance of 2,o00 yards from east to west. The height of the rock on
each side varies. The strata exposed belong to the Keuper and Bunter formations.
The pebble-beds of the Bunter crop out for 914 yards along the east of the cutting,

but do not contain any marl partings, and not a single pebble of any kind has been
noticed. Only two faults occur along the whole length of the pebble-beds exposed,
and they are of very little importance. The subdivision ends at Smithdown Lane,
where there is a fault, with a downthrow to the west, which brings in the upper
mottled sandstone, the highest member of the Bunter formation, where it is not

represented on the map of the Geological Survey or the fault recorded. The

upper mottled is a fine-grained, soft, bright red sandstone with grey streaks, and, as
it readily crumbles into sand, is never hard enough for building purposes. It crops

out to the west from Smithdown Lane to University College, when a fault throws
down the strata about GOO feet and brings in tbe Keuper sandstone, which is 400
feet thick and interstratitied with beds of marl. The highest beds of the Keuper

are at the College ; lower strata containing the beds of marl crop out from beneath,,

and are thrown down to the west by faults three times in succession when the base-
ment beds crop iip in Lime Street Station.

     The section shows that all the faults throw down the strata to the west and

bring in higher beds in that direction. It also shows the exact position of the

fault between the Bunter and Keuper formations, which was not known before.
     The position of the Keuper as a wedge-shaped mass of sandstone, with the

Bunter formation faulted against it on the east and west, is of great local interest,

and it is easy to understand how the succession of the strata has not been satisfac-

torily explained before, in the absence of any such a continuous section as that

described.

     The remarkable absence of faults in the pebble-beds has an important bearing
on the construction of the Mersey tunnel, which will have to be carried through,
those beds along its entire length. The section shows that while faults are

numerous in the Keuper sandstone, which was frequently fractured during subsi-

Adence into a depression, the pebble-beds are very little faulted.  few days ago,

when under the Mersey, I did not find a single fault either in the tunnel or in the

headinjT beneath.

                        3. The Master-Divisions of the Tertiary Period.

                      By Professor W. Boyd Dawkins, F.E.S.

                                                            (1) iNTRODXJCTIOBr.

      The classiflcatiou of Tertiary rocks sketched out some fifty years ago, and since
 then altered in no important degree, is out of harmonj^ with our present knowledge,
and the definitions of the series of events which took place in it has been greatly
 modified by the progress of discovery in various parts of the world. The terms
 Eocene, Meiocene, and Pleiocene no longer express the idea of percentages of living
species of fossil mollusca upon which they were based, and ' Post-tertiary, Quater-
 nary,' and ' Recent ' are founded on the assumed existence of a great break com-
 parable to that separating the Secondary from the Primary or Tertiary Periods,
 which has long ago been given up. In 1880 ' the author proposed a classification
of the Tertiary Period in Europe by an appeal to the land-mammalia, and since
 that time his definitions have been found to apply equally well to the Tertiaries of

Asia and the Americas, and to the later Tertiaries of Australia. He therefore

presents the following outline to the members of the British Association.

                            (2) The Principle of Classification.

      The forms of life in the rocks have changed at a very variable rate, and in direct
proportion to their complexity of organisation, the lower and simpler having an
enormous range in the rocks, while the higher and more complex have a much
narrower range, and have been more easily afiected by changes in the environment.
The carboniferous conifers, for example, do not diti'er profoundly from living forms,
while the carbomferous labyrinthodons have left no representatives behind them.

At the beginning of the Tertiary Period the whole of the vegetable kingdom, and

with but some few exceptions the invertebrata in the animal kingdom, had

arrived at the stage of evolution which they now present. The fishes, amphibians,

and reptiles belong to well-recognised types in existing nature, and the birds had
left behind the ancestral characters which allied them so closely to the reptiles in

-- --the Secondary Period the long tail, and the armature of teeth in their beaks and

belong ti) living orders.

     The mammalia, on the other hand, feebly represented in the Secondary Period
by small marsupial forms, appear in force in the early Tertiary beds, and were, as
Prof. Gaudry happily terms it, ' en pleine evolution ' in the early divisions of the

-- --Tertiary strata the Eo-, Meio-, and Pleio-cene Ages and have changed M-ith suffi-

cient swiftness to allow of their being used to mark the hour on the geological

clock in difierent parts of the world.

                 (3) The Tertiary Period includes our oavst Time,

     Nor can there be any doubt as to the definition of the series of events included
under tlie term Tertiary. It begins with the appearance of the placental mammalia,
and it must include our owi: time if it be looked at from the same biological point of
view as the Primary or Secondary groups. "\\'ith some few exceptions the whole of
the plants and animals now alive were living in the Pleiocene and Pleistocene ages,
and therefore there is no break of sufficient importance to justify the use of the
terms ' post-Tertiary ' or ' Quaternary ' for the newer divisions. These exceptions
are probably due merely to the accident of their non-discovery in the Pleiocene and

Pleistocene strata.

                 (4) The MAsiEE-Divisioifs of the Tektiaet Period.

     The master-divisions of the Tertiary Period may be defined by the following-
characters so far as relates to the mammalia :

     a. The Eocene Age, or that in which the placental mammals now on the earth
were represented by allied forms belonging to existing families and orders. No
living genera of placental mammals were present either in the Old or the New
World. For example, the order Primates, to which man belongs, is represented

by lemur-like creatures (adajns) in the Upper Eocenes of Europe, and in the
Lower Middle and Upper Eocenes of the United States. The Eocene carnivores
present close affinities with the marsupials, and one living marsupial genus {didel-

phys), opossum, haunted the Eocene forests of Europe.

   --b. The Meiocene Age. In the Meiocene Age we meet with living genera for

the first time, such as rhinoceros, cervus, antelope, tapir, hog, cat, hyaena, and
others. The Primates are represented by higher forms than before, by the simiadfB,

or true apes, both in the Old and New Worlds. It is also worthy of note that in

the Lower Meiocene Period in Europe marsupials were still present. The

opossums still lingered in the forests, and the marsupial ancestry of the carnivores
still asserted itself in the singular combination of characters ofiered by the

hyaiiodon.

     The term Oligocene, originally invented by Professor Beyrich in 1856, and
recently adopted in Britain by Professor Judd, embraces the Upper Eocenes and

the Lower Meiocenes. It appears to me an unnecessary subdivision and to be
incapable of definition by its fossil contents from the Upper Eocene and Lower

Meiocene strata. It includes sucli characteristic forms as the Upper Eocene

fdloeotheriuin and the ^Meiocene diinotherium.

   --c. The Pleiocene Age. In the next or Pleiocene Age the living genera_ are

abundant, and living mammalian species appear, such as the hippopotamus, iu a
fauna mainly characterised by extinct species of mammalia.

     d. The Pleistocene Age.--In the Pleistocene Age lining species of placental
mammals predominated greatly over the extinct, and cave- and river-drift man
appears. In this age the mammal fauna of the whole world reached its present

--phase of development in Europe the European, in India the Indian, and in

North and South America the types now found in those parts of the world._ In

Australia also the marsupials present the same stage of development, and the living
marsupials are more numerous than the extinct. The term ' Glacial,' sometimes
used as the equivalent of Pleistocene, is merely of local application, and applies
only to those regions in which the traces of glaciers and icebergs occur, where
glaciers and icebergs are no longer to be found. ' Quaternary ' is open to the grave
objection mentioned above, that it implies a break in life which has no existence.

   --e. The Prehistoric Period. The vegetable and animal kingdom had arrived at

their present stage of specialisation at the close of the Pleistocene Age, and there-

fore the series of events from that age down to the present time must be looked at
from a point of view other than that offered by the evolution of the mammalia.
The point of view which seems to me the best is that offered by history, and
they may be divided into the prehistoric and the historic. The prehistoric period
is that in which the domestic animals and cultivated fruits appear. Man is

abundant, and in the neolithic bronze and iron stages of culture.
    /, The Historic Period, or that embraced by the written records, varies in

different countries.

      These definitions are, so far as the author knows, no mere parochial definitions
applicable to a limited area, but apply to the series of events in the Tertiary Period
over the whole world. They are the result of an inquiry which he undertook some
twenty years ago at the request of his late friend John Kichard Green, to see
whether the series of events recorded in the Tertiary strata could be brought into

relation with those recorded by history.

6. On the Occurrence of Remains of Ldbyrintlwdonts in the Yoredale Rocks
                  of Wensleydcde. Bij James W. Davis, F.G.S.

Prof. Miall has described the bones of a portion of the hiud limb of a labyiin-

thodont hi the ' Quart. Journal of the Geological Societj',' vol. xxx. p. 775. They

mwere found a dark-coloured flag-rock above the Harmby Quariy and exteudiny;

with an easterly dip to Harmby Ivaihvay-Cutting. The same flag-rock extends

behind Leyburn and the Shawl, and in that locality it has been extensively quarried.

In addition to the leg-bones already mentioned others have been found in the same

flag-rock, but separated by considerable distances, so that it is not probable that

they belonged to the same labyrintliodont. In the railway-catting a portion of a

cranium was found. It is I'iJ inch in length and 1-4 in breadth, its thickness

Ais '15 of an inch aud is of a somewhat open and porous structure.                                                                                                                 longitudinal

depression extends completely across the upper surface, on each side of which, and

Aparallel with it, is a well-developed convexity.                                                                                                                                  number of sutures, not very well

defined, seem to indicate that the bone occupied a position in the skull probably

between and immediately behind the orbits, and extending backwards to the

occipitals, comprising the Irontals, parietals, part of the occipital, aud a portion of the

squamosal bones. The under surface is coarsely striated and porous, corresponding

generally to the upper surface.

The third specimen was found in the quarries beyond the Shawl X.W. of Ley-

burn and exhibits casts of the jaws of a labyrinthodont. Each ramus is about

3 inches in length they have been disturbed and displaced.                                                                                                                         The rami at a dis-
                                                                                                          ;

tance of 1 inch from the posterior extremity are ··5 of an inch in depth, beyond

which they gradually taper to the anterior extremity. The external surface of the

jaws was ornamented with a reticulated arrangement of tubercles, an impression

of which is preserved in the specimen. Along the margin of the impression of

the alveolar portion of one of the rami there is a series of impressions which

appears to have been caused by small pointed teeth. The specimens are perhaps

too fragmentary to afford sufliciently good characters on which to base determina-

tions of specific or even generic value                                                                                                                                            and the wide dispersal of the bones, though
                                                                                                                                                                                ;

in the same stratum, renders their affinity problematical.

7. On some Fossil Fish-Remains found in the Upper Beds of the Yoredale
        Series at Leyhurn, in Yorkshire. By James W. Davis, F.G.S.

The red limestone forms the upper part of the main limestone of Phillips,

being separated from it by only i foot of .shale or plate. It is about 100 feet be-

low the millstone grits, the intermediate beds being composed of grits and shales,

Awith one bed of limestone about IG or 18 feet thick.                                                                                                                              peculiar aggregation of

fish-remains has been discovered in the red beds by Mr. Wm. Home, of Leyburn.

They comprise nearly forty species, the majority of which are peculiar to the beds
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

others, like Cladodus and Petalodus, are common to the mountain limestone, and

do not appear to difler either in size or otherwise from those of the lower massive

limestone. The representatives of the genera Psammodus, Cochliodus, and Poly-

rhizodus, which are found abundantly in the lower limestone, and are of great

size and importance, are in this locality comparatively small and rare, and appear

to indicate that the tishes they represent were gradually becoming extinct. Tbeir

representatives are not known to occur in the superimposed millstone grits either in

this locality or in any other. There are in addition species of the genera Mega-

lichthys aud Pleurodus, which are characteristic of the coal measures. The presence

of so vnried a fauna naturally leads to the inference that the circumstances under

which they existed were not those usually characteristic of the aggregation of lime-

stones, but rather indicate a shallow or shore deposit with occasional influxes of
--

fresh water. Megalichtliys and Pleurodus are fishes which in the coal measures

probably lived in fresh or brackish water ; and though they may have been adapted

to exist in marine conditions, the occurrence of beds of sand aiid shale intercalated
with the thin limestones of the Yoredales evidently shows the proximity of land,
and it is probable that they were carried to their present position by rivers and
there deposited with the marine forms with which they are associated. The sup-

position that the water was brackish may account for the small size of some of the

genera already mentioned, and their final extinction in the grits and shales which
succeed the limestone. The great fishes whose remains are found in the lower
limestone, represented by Ctenacanthus, Oracanthus, and others, are absent, the only
spines hereto found being those of Cladacanthus and Physonemus.

             2. Oil some supposed Fossil Algce from Garhoniferous BocJcs.

                 By Professor \Y. C. Williamson, LL.B., F.B.S.

     During past years many objects have been figured and described by authors
under various names, but all of which have been regarded by some palceontologists
as Fucoids. One very curious group especially, obtained "from the pre-carboni-
ferous rocks, has been described under such names as Bilobites, Chrossochorda
&c. The Rev. Isidore Kavannah, a young alumnus of Stonyhurst Colle"-e, near
Whalley, about a year ago placed in the author's hands a number of specimens

which he had found in Yoredale rocks on the banks of the Hodder, near the colleo-e.

These specimens would be considered by those who believe in the vegetable nature

of such examples to belong to the genus Chrossochorda. M. Nathorst has recently
given excellent reasons for regarding aU such specimens as being merely the casts
of the depressed tracks of Crustaceans, worms, and other animals, and in plate 1,
fig. 1 of his mem_ou-_> he has_ figured one formed by the crustacean Corop/n'um
longicorne, which, in its essential features, corresponds with the various Chrosso-
chordae. Hitherto none of these latter objects have been found in the carboniferous
rocks ; but since the author received the Stonyhurst specimens Mr. Robert Kidson
of Stirling, has figured one from the Carboniferous beds of Liddlesdale, under the
name of Chrossochorda carbonaria. In his specimens the pennatiform ridges o-iven
off obliquely from the central longitudinal furrow are smooth. In the author's
specimens they are markedly muricated or regularly tuberculated. Whilst wholly
rejecting the idea of these objects being other than the casts of animal tracts these

specimens may be known provisionally as Chrossochorda tuherndata.

   A number of casts strikingly representing branching algse were made on a

4 On the Geological Relations and Mode of Preservation of Eozoon cana-

             dense. By Principal J. W. Dawson, C.M.G., F.B.S.

     Tlie oldest known formation in Canada is tlie Ottawa gneiss, or funda-

mental gneiss, a mass of gi-eat but unlsnown thickness, and of vast area, consisting
entirely of orthoclase gneiss, imperfectly bedded and destitute of limestones,
quartzite, or other rocks which might be supposed to indicate the presence of land-

surfaces and ordinary aqueous deposition. It constitutes the lower part of the Lower
Laurentian of Logan, and may be regarded either as a portion of tlie earth's
original crust, or as a deposit thereon by aqueo-igneous agency and without any

evidence of derivative deposits.
      Succeeding this is a formation of very different character, though still belonging-

to the Lower Lam-entian of Logan. It may be named the Grenville series, and

includes beds of limestone, quartzite, iron ore, and graphitic and hornblendic schists,
with evidence locally of pebble-beds. It is in this, and especially in one of its great
limestones, the Greiaville limestone, that Eozoon canadense occurs. It was shown
that these limestones are regularly bedded and of great horizontal extent. The
Grenville formation presents lithological evidence of ordinary atmospheric erosion
of the older rocks and of ordinary aqueous as well as organic deposition.

     Above this is the Norian series, or Upper Laurentian of Logan, in whieli lime
felspars iDecome dominant, and show that the calcareous rocks accumulated in the

preceding period were already contributing to the material of new deposits. No

evidence^of Eozoon has been found in this formation, which is thus far entirely

unfossiliferous.

     The Hui'onian and other series, also eozoic or pre-Cambrian rocks, overlie the
Noriau, and in one of these, the Hastings group, belonging probably to the Taconian
of Hunt, specimens of Eozoon and indications of worm-burrows and other obscure

fossils have been found.

     With reference to the mode of preservation of Eozoon, it was stated that in its

ordinary condition, as mineralised by Serpentine, it presents the simplest kind of
mineralisation of a calcareous fossil, that in which the original calcite walls still

exist with no change except a crystallisation of the calcite common in the i'ossils of
newer formations, and with the cavities filled with a hydrcMS silicate which was
evidently in process of deposition on the sea-bottom on which Eozoon is supposed to
have lived. Commencing with this fact, the author proceeded to show that the
various imperfections and accidents of preservation observed in Eozoon are precisely

parallel to those observed in paliEOZoic and mesozoic fossils.

     In conclusion it was stated that many new observations had been made by Dr.
Carpenter and the author, and would appear in a memoir now in course of

preparation by the former ; and that the author hoped, on occasion of the visit of
the British Association to Canada next year, to exhibit to those interested in the

subject the large series of specimens now in the museum of McGLIl University.

5. On the Geological Age of the North Atlantic Ocean. By Professor
    Edward Hull, LL.D., F.R.8.

     In this paper the author made use of three leading formations, as factors in his
inquiry, viz., the Archaean (or Laurentian), the Silurian (chiefly the Lower Silurian),

and tlie Carboniferous.  _

(1) Dealing with the Archsean, he traced its range both through the North
American continent, and that of Europe and the British Isles, showing that there

is every reason for concluding that the strata of this age underlie all the more

recent formations of these tracts, and assuming that the metamorphic beds (con-

sisting of wranite or gneiss, hornblendic and other schists, quartzites, &c., of pre-

cambrian a^-e), were originally oceanic sediments, he drew the inference that the

oricinating^lands of these sediments were situated in the region intermediate

betw^een North America and Europe, in other words, in the Central and North
Atlantic region, probably including Greenland.
TBANSACTIONS OV SECTION C.  495

     (2) As regards the Silurian (Lower Silurian rocks), he showed by comparison

of sections over the North American continent (a) that the strata referable to this
epoch swell out as they approach the eastern seaboard, and thin away, or pass into
calcareous beds in the opposite direction. Similarly it was shown that the
sediments of this epoch in Europe swell out westwards, and thin away, or pass
into calcareous strata in an opposite direction, as shown by a comparison of the
sections in the British Isles, the north-west of France, and north of Spain, with
those of Russia. Thus, while the Lower Silurian beds of Britain and the north of
France have a thickaess of from 20,000 to 25,000 feet, in which beds of limestone
are exceptional, those of the Baltic provinces and the shores of the Gulf of Finland
have dwindled down to a thickness of only 1,500 feet, of which limestones, a.s
shown by Professor Schmidt, form an important portion.

     From the above comparisons the conclusion was drawn that when the Lower
Silurian beds were being formed, the originating lands must have Iain over the area
of the Atlantic Ocean, that being the region towards which the strata swell out
on either hand ; while the replacement of the sediments by limestone indicates the

position of the contemporaneous oceans over Central Europe and "Western America.
      (3). In a similar manner, dealing with the Carboniferous strata, the author

showed by a comparison of sections, that over the American area the sedimentary
strata swell out in the du-ection of the Atlantic shore, while they thin down or pass
into limestones in the direction of theHocky Mountains; so that (with one notable
exception, that of the Weber quartzite in Nevada) both the upper and lower

Carboniferous beds consist mainly of marine limestones in the western States, while
their representatives of North-East America swell out into about 16,000 feet

of strata, consisting throughout of sedimentary materials.
     Reverting to the British Isles, the author referred to former papers in which he

had shown how the sedimentary materials of the Carboniferous period swell out
both towards the N.W. and S.W. of the British Isles, while the calcareous beds

thin out or are replaced in the same directions.

    From these and other considerations the author had long since inferred the

position of the originating lands to have been to the north-west and south-west

of the British area; and connecting this with the evidence afforded by the
Carboniferous sediments of America, he concluded that it was one and the same-
Atlantic continent which had given forth the materials of which the Carboniferous

series on either hand had been constructed.

     Thus it would appear that throughout the Archaean, or Laurentian, the Lower
Siliu-ian, and the Carboniferous epochs, the regions of North America on the one
hand, and of the British Isles and Western Europe were submerged, while a large
part of the North Atlantic area existed as dry land, from the waste of which these

great formations had been built up : and he urged that if such were the case, the
doctrine of the permanency of oceans and continents, as tested by the case of the

North Atlantic, falls to the ground.

6. On the Influence of Barometric Pressure on the Discharge of Water frovt
   Springs. By Baldwin Latham, M.Inst.G.E., F.G.S., F.B.M.8.

     In 1881, at the York meeting of the British Association, the author gave the
result of a series of observations which he had carried on with reference to the
influence of barometric pressure on the discharge of water from the ground, and
he showed from the result of a series of gaugings of the periodical bourne-flow
at Croydon, that there were certain times when tlie underground waters were
influenced by barometric pressure, and that with a fall of the barometer an increase
in the quantity of water discharged from the springs occurred. The fluctuation due
to barometric pressmre in the case of the Croydon bourne-flow at one period had
exceeded half a million gallons per day. It was also shown from the results
of percolating gauges, that even in a period of extreme dryness, with a rapid fall
of the barometer, a small quantity of water passed out of the percolating gauges.

     Since the foregoing observations were made, the author has had an opportunity

of continuing liis otservations, and finds that percolating gauges are aiFected in the

same way under the influence of barometric pressure as shown on a former occasion
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

"but in order to make a crucial test as to whether or not the water flowing from an

artesian well would be aflected by variations of barometric pressure, he instituted

a series of observations at the end of the year 1881 and the beginning of 1882, in

connection with a well which he had had bored at the Croydon Rural Sanitary

Authority's works in the lower part of Mitchara parish.

The well referred to has been bored through the London clay and Tertiary beds

into the chalk, and a watertight bore-pipe inserted from top to bottom ; having a

steel shoe at the bottom it has been securely driven into the chalk, and the water

overflows the surface. In making the experiments a length of iron pipe was fixed

on the bore-pipe so as to bring it some feet above the ground level, and in the side

of this pipe a small aperture was made in order to allow the overflowing water to

escape, the result being that the water was headed up above the aperture about

A2 feet.  float fitted with graduated rod was floated on the water in the bore-

pipe, and from the observations made in this way it was found that whenever there

was a fall in the barometer the column of water in the bore-pipe increased in

altitude ; while, on the other hand, for every rise in the barometer there was a

corresponding fall in the column of water in the bore-pipe.

The results of the observations are shown upon a diagram, and establish the fact,

already very clearly demonstrated with reference to the gaugings of the bourne-flow

at Croydon, that barometric pressure does exercise a considerable influence in

accelerating or retarding the escape of water from the ground, the cause of which

the author attributes, as on a former occasion, to the expansion and condensation

of the air and gases held by the water, wliich at a period of low barometric

pressm-e have a tendency to escape and so facilitate the flow of water, while under

the conditions of high barometric pressure the tendency is in the opposite

direction, and retards the flow of the water.

                          SATURDAY, SEP!EMBER 22.

     The following Papers and Report were read :

1. Some additional notes on Anthracosaurus Edgei (Baity sp.), a large
       Sauro-Batrachian from the Lower Coal Measures, Jarrow CoJlien/, near
       Castlecomer, County Kilkenng. Bij William Hellier Baily, F.L.S.,

        F.O.S., M.E.I.A.

     At the meeting of the British Association held at Dublin in 1878 a ' Notice of
some additional Labyrinthodont Amphibia and Fish from Jarrow Colliery, County
Kilkenny,' was read by the author. In this communication he alluded to a large
batrachian he had previously described, and named Anthracosaurus Edgei, in a

paper read before the Royal Irish Academy, January 13, 1873. He then estimated

from the remains of that fossil, as then known, that it indicated an animal of from

·eight to ten feet in length.
      Since that time, and during the present year, through the kindness of Joseph

DobbSjEsq., J.P., proprietor of the colliery, who has most liberally aided the author

in these investigations, he has been enabled to obtain, in addition to most interest-
ing fish-remains, for the collection of the Geological Survey of Ireland, a more
complete example of this, perhaps the largest sauro-batrachian extant.

     The drawing illustrating this communication exhibited as exact a representation
as could be taken of this remarkable fossil, of the natural size. It shows the
impression of a somewhat triangularly shaped head, viewed from the inferior or
palatal surface. It measures twelve inches in length and ten inches in breadth.

     The vertebral column, as preserved, numbers about sixty separate elements,
          TB.\NSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                  497

those nearest the head and belonging to the abdominal region being merely indi-
cated ; towards the extremity, however, they clearly show the attached superior and
inferior spinous processes ; the chain of vertebrae curves towards the tail, which is

deficient.

    Sixteen ribs may be counted on each side of the vertebral column, the greatest

breadth of this, the abdominal portion, being ten inches.
     About four and a half feet from the snout is shown the greater portion of one

of the hind limbs, the femur, tibia and fibula, somewhat displaced, tarsal bones, and

the first bones of the five digits.
     Evidence of the dermal armour is also exhibited on this fossil, as impressions

of elongated osseous scutes arranged in oblique rows.

     This specimen as preserved measures nearly eight feet in length, and would
have been ten or more feet to the extremity of the tail. It is impressed upon the
smooth surface of a bed of impure coal, the slab containing it weighing several cwt.,

and its preservation reflects great credit upon the bailiff, ilr. John Bradley, who

took the greatest care of it, considering the friable character of its matrix.
     Another fossil obtained from this colliery at the same time, is a head, which the

author beheves to be also identical with Anthracosawus Edgei ; it is in a better state
of preservation, although squeezed quite flat ; it presents a profile view, and appears
to be closely allied to a well-preserved head from the Shropshire coal-field in the

collection of G. Maw, Esq., F.G.S., originally described as Loxomma, but which

the author believes Prof. Huxley afterwards referred to his genus Anthracosaurus.

   A rough drawing of the natural size of this head (from the cast in plaster)

was exhibited to compare with the specimen from Jarrow Colliery, Kilkenny,
which is much larger, the Dudley head measuring 13 inches in length, whilst the

other is lo| inches long.

    2. On Basalt apparenth/ overlyinq Pout-Glacial Beds, Co. Antrim.
                                 By W. J. Knowles.

     The author drew attention to a mass of basalt about 50 feet long, 20 feet wide,
and 3 to 9 feet in thickness resting on a portion of what is known as Interglacial
beds near Cullybackey, County Antrim. This is only a portion of a larger mass, a
part having been removed a few years ago for road-making.

3. Recent Opinions on the Loess Deposits of the Valley of the Wiine.

                             By I^Iaek Stireop, F.G.S.

Mr. Stirrup criticised adversely some recent opinions of Mr. H. H. Howorth,

F.S.A., which have been published in the ' Geological Magazine,' wherein Mr.

Howorth has attempted to prove a 'great post-Glacial flood' by the evidence
afforded by the mammoth and that of several post-Glacial or drift deposits. Mr.

Stirrup pointed out that several facts connected with the loess of the Rhine

valley were not consistent with the interpretation given to them by Mr. Howorth,

nor was the assumption that the materials of the loess were derived from volcanic
muds borne out by the evidence.

    From the cumulative evidence of the palaeontological and geological data Mr.
Howorth infers a great diluvial movement over the larger part of the northern

hemisphere, which was accompanied by an equally sudden and violent change of

climate.

     Mr. Stirrup maintained that the proofs advanced in support of this deluge were

inconclusive and fallacious ; for if the extinction of the mammoth were due to such
a cataclysm, how are we to account for the survival of the reindeer, musk ox,
lemming, and other animals whose fossil bones are found with those of the mammoth

and whose descendants still inhabit Northern Europe ?

It would have been impossible for any terrestrial animal to have survived a

deluge of the character and magnitude postulated by Mr. Howorth. This attempt

to resuscitate some of the obsolete doctrines of Cuvier and Buckland (whose

1883.     KK
--498 REPORT 1883.

speculative reasoning is not in accordance with what we know of the actual opera-
tions of nature) Mr. Stirrup thought would he a retrograde movement in the history
of geology, and that it would he safer to adhere to those sound principles of the
Huttonian philosophy which considered the little causes, long continued, as com-

petent to bring about the greatest changes of the earth.

    4. On the former Physical Condition of Glendale, Northumberland.
                                      By G. P. Hughes.

     The author exhibited horns of Bos primiffenius (urus) and antlers of the red
deer, both found fifty years since in a bog at Middleton Hall, south of Wooler. The
latter has twenty-three points, and is believed to be the largest in Great Britain.
They were found fourteen feet from the surface in marl, underlying peat. The bog

in which they were found will now be explored, in hopes of finding more remains.
The author believes that this and similar deposits elsewhere found along the valley
indicate that Glendale was once a lake.

5. On a Conglomerate ivith Boulders in the Lanrentian Bocns of North Uisf,
                             Scotland. By James Thomson.

     The author described pebbles and boulders, up to 5 ft. 10 in. in diameter,
unstratified with the gneiss and granitoid gneiss of Harris and of Loch Maddy, in
North Uist. The included fragments are of hornblendic, gneissic, and granitoid
rocks. The author believes these to belong to the Lanrentian series and not to
a later division of the pre-Cambrian rocks.

6. On a Coral Atoll on the Shore-line at Arhigland, near Dumfries, Scot-
                               land. By James Thomson.

The author briefly described the stratified rocks of the shore-line in the neigh-

bourhood of Arhigland, and stated that a portion of these stratified rocks consisted

of linear coral reefs extending for two miles along the coast line. In Arhigland

bay the reefs are more or less circular in outline, recurving at either extremity.

These are overlain by a series of reefs which are circular in outline, in which he

found  several  species  of the  fasciculate  varieties  of Lithostrotion                                                              also  Syringopora,
                                                                                                                                    ;

Aulopora, Cladocouus, and Monticulopora. And in the dark calcareous shale in

the interior of the encircling reefs are numerous species of the Astraei-formed

varieties of Lithostrotion, in dense formed masses varying in size from 1 in. to

11 ft. 10 in. in diameter. He also discovered embedded in the shale a species of

fossil sponge, which has been described by Mr. Carter as Pulvulus Thomsoni. One

specimen of this sponge measured 11 in. long by 5 in. broad. These facts imply

conditions similar to those described by Dana, and Darwin in the Atolls of the

present day. The Atoll at Arhigland is the first one recorded of Carboniferous
Aage.
       detailed description, with a list of fossil remains, wiU be published at no

3. Preliminary Notice of the Earthquahe 0/I88I in the Island of Ischia.

                       By H. J. Johnston- Lavis, F.G.S.

The earthquake of March 4, 1881, occurred at 1.5 p.ii., and resulted in the

entire destruction of the greater part of Casamenella, severely injuring the upper

parts of Casamicciola and Lacco-Ameno, besides Casamonte, PeneUa, and Fano-o.

Beyond this extended an area, including a little of Porto d' Ischia, Faiano,

Fontana, Monterone di Forio and most of Lacco, in which the houses were fissured.

It will thus be seen that the area affected by the shock was a remarkably small one.
The buildings of Casamenella which were in the mesoseismal area were characterised

by the collapse of the roofs and floors with comparatively little injury to the walls,

showing their nearness to the seismic vertical. Passing outwards in a radial
manner fi-om the seismic vertical, we find the angle of emergence rapidly declines,

and the damage of the houses similarly diminishes, so that within a very short

distance the efl'eets are hardly visible.

   We may therefore conclude from these facts that we have a slight earthquake

having its origin very near the surface, and tliat its destructiveness was dependent

on the same cause, for had it been at any considerable depth it might have pro-

duced movements of very slight intensity. It must also be mentioned that the

peculiar style of architecture, the bad materials and workmanship, combined with

age of most of the buildings, helped very greath' towards the ruin.

It wiU be seen that the isoseismals assiune ellipsoidal figures, with their major

axis running nearly east and west, and are, therefore, no doubt, derived from a
fissure whose plane strilces from a few degrees east of south to a few degrees west

of north, passing just west of Casamenella, and therefore forming the minor axis of

the ellipsoid. It will be observed that this is not quite correct, and that the

isoseismals are nearer the seismic vertical  on  the  eastern side                                                        this, therefore, would
                                                                                                                       ;

incline us to believe that the fissure dips slightly to the west, so that the earth-

waves on the east are directed beneath and away from the sm-face, so as to be

absorbed and lost, whilst those on the west would be directed towards the surface.

Another important point is that the isoseismals are nearer each other on the

northern side ; this might be explained by the axis of greatest violence exercised

during the production and injection of the fissure not being perpendicular but

inclined to a few degrees east of south.

     Ischia, as is well known, is an old submarine volcanic cone surmounted by a
large crater denuded away on the southern side. Since its upheaval at successive

periods from beneath the sea, it has given birth to a number of subaerial eruptions

from lateral or parasitic craterets, of which Rotaro, Montagnone, Cremate of 1302,

Crater of Molara, Grotta della Terra, Casapolita, and Zale, are the principal

examples. Some of these have appeared in historic times, and were preceded by a

series of violent earthquakes that i'rom time to time drove away the inhabitants.

Tlie town of Fontana occupies the centre of the great or mother crater of

Monte Epomeo, and if we draw a radial line from that village to the Marina at

Lacco, we shall find that the strike of the fissure causing the earthquake lies on

Nowthis line.  it is well known that most lateral eruptions take place from a

               KK2
--500
BEPOKT 1883.

radial fissure extending outwards from the cliimney of the volcano, so that we see
the position and plane of this fissure shows it to be no exception to the rule. The

centre of violence on the surface occupies the same relation to the axis of the
volcano as does Monte Kotaro, Montagnone, and Cremate, the three most normally
placed centres of eruption, so that an outburst at this point would have just the

position from which we should expect it to occur.

     In the case of an active volcano, the radial fissure extends outwards from the whole

length of the chimney, as pointed out by Mallet ; but when we have to deal with a

case similar to Ischia, the canal has no doubt been plugged by a mass of trachyte
that for at least some thousands of years has been able to gradually cool from the

surface downwards. Any escape, therefore, of unconsolidated igneous matter

would probably occur at the point of least resistance, and so would be into
the fragmentary material, in preference to following the plugged chimney. The
fissure would, therefore, have a tendency to branch out, forming an angle with
the main axis and extending itself by spasmodic ruptures, followed by immediate

injection of igneous matter, and would not send the maximum impulse in an
upward direction perpendicular to the horizon, but inclined, just as we see denoted

by the eccentricity ot the different isoseismal ellipsoids.
      There is yet another point to be cleared up. Fontana is not included in the

isoseismals, yet it suffered rather severely. Very few of the walls of the houses

were damaged, but hardly a roof, of the arch masonry type especially, escaped being

fissured and cracked in such a way that the fractuies usually assumed a circular
form in the centre of the vaidt, with others radially extending outwards. The
wooden beams over tlie doors and windows were bent down or broken by a piece
of masonry of a A shape, included in fractures extending from each upper corner
of the opening in the wall. There was also no evidence of lateral movement by
injuries. The people remarked a strong subsultory shock, followed by a slight

undulatory one.

     There is, therefore, plenty of evidence to show that we have here a series of
injuries depending upon a wave issuing from the earth vertically or nearly so.

How can we explain this ?
    We have in one earthquake two seismic verticals, one siirrounded by a district

in which the damage diminishes more or less gradually as we recede from the
mesoseismal area : in the other we have a small mesoseismal (?) area surrounded by

 districts quite uninjured.

      The followiug explanation has appeared to the author to clear up the difficulty,
and therefore perhaps he may be permitted to give it.

     As already stated, Fontana occupies the centre of the great crater of Epomeo,

 and therefore lies immediately over the old chimney, which in all proljability is
 filled by an old plug of consolidated trachyte which must descend to the igneous

reservoir. Any increase of tension in tlie general mass of igneous matter that

 might determine the further rupture of a collateral fissure would result in the
 conduction of any changes of pressure or vibrations along the column of higlily
 elastic trachyte, whilst the same earth-waves would be annulled or absorbed by the
 inelastic tufas surrounding it, so that the l)low would be struck perpendicularly to
 the surface and in a small area, with well-defined borders. The undulatory
 sensations after the principal local shock were those that were derived from the

 great centre of impulse beneath Casamenella.

      The earthquake occurred at an epoch of general seismic activity throughout
 Europe, although its own vibrations were only communicated to short distances.
 It was felt at Vivara, Procida, Bacoli, and Misenum, and at Ventotene and Ponza
very slightly. At Naples and Vesuvius, even the most delicate seismographs were
 undisturbed. This is comprehensible when we think over the geology of the
 district, and remember its composition of tufas of different but always low elas-
 ticity inclined at every imaginable angle, so that the earth-wave would be refracted
 and reflected every few yards, besides being absorbed by the inelastic medium.

      But, moreover, it is possible to show that the earth-wave in passing from the

 focus to the instruments in a straight line would have to be transferred from the

 earth to the sea, thence to the air, thence again to the earth, or directly to the
                     TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.            501

instruments, as tliese are placed similarly to the towns on mountains, -where the
earth-wave passes beneath them, as illustrated by Mallet.

     Dr. Samuel Haughton has calculated from projected objects the molecular

velocity, which turns out to be 464 feet per second. The maximum molecular

velocity was determined in three cases, and found to be 4'087, 4'553, and 5-273
feet per second respectively ; the mean of all being 4-64 feet per second.

     The velocity of transmission could not be obtained, partly on account of the
small distances within which clocks were stopped, and the imperfect time kept.

     The number of deaths resulting from this earthquake were 127.
     It is said there were changes in the temperature of the mineral waters and
fumaroli, but the author was unable to verify if such had really been the case, and
when he examined thermometrically the principal ones, some days after, he could
not find any important variations from their usual state.

4. Preliminary Notice on the Earthquake of July 188Z in the Island of Ischia.

                          By H. J. Johnston-Lavis, F.G.S.

     On July 28, 1883, at 9.25 p.m., a violent shock of earthquake reduced to

ruins Casamicciola, including the districts of Tresta, Olivieri, Panella, Casamonte,
Mezzavia, most of Lacco, Fango, Monterone and Vajola di Forio; injuring very
.severely the rest of Lacco, Monticchio, the greater part of Forio, Panza, Serrara-
Fontana, Fontana, Maropano, Barano, Piejo, Faiano, and Rotaro.

     Beyond this extends a third area, covering most of the island, in which the houses

were only slightly fissured.
     The isoseismals have almost exactly the same form and arrangements as in the

earthquake of 1881, but from the far greater violence of the shock, they are

--naturally larger. The houses included within the mesoseismal area that is, Casa-
--menella'and the Purgatorio district of Casamicciola, with part of Fango were ruined

to such an extent that hardly the stumps of the walls were left, and it was rare to
find a piece of masonry which was not reduced into its ultimate fragments, so that
it was uncommon to find two or three stones still attached together. Objects were
projected considerable distances, the iron tie-bars put into walls after the 1881

injuries were broken and bent like thin iron wire.

One fact very remarkable in this last earthquake was the effect of geological

structure. Thus, for instance, all the houses situated on the brink of a valley where

the tufa was loose and incoherent, were iii most cases quite destroyed from the fis-

sures of an incipient or complete landslip. Buildings with foundations on the loose

alluvial tufas of the plains of valley bottoms have suffered much less than others

Webuilt directly upon the sofid tufa.  may compare, for instance, Casamonte and

some farm-houses on the little plain close at hand. The most remarkable effects of

this kind are the Marinas of Casamicciola and Lacco-Ameno, where some houses,

that are built entirely on loose sea-sand, have only nominally suffered, whereas

houses built on the tufa, and only a few paces distant, are more or less ruined.

Faiano, which is almost in contact with the large masses of trachyte of Monte

Toppo and Monte Vetta, has suffered very severely, probably as the result of the

different vibratory increments of two materials differing so widely in their elas-

ticity. It is no doubt due to the rapid annulling by absorption, refraction, and re-

flection from the media traversed, that all volcanic earthquakes are so very limited

in their extension.

Besides the actual damage done to the houses, a number of landslips occurred,

Athree of which are worthy of remark for their extension.  large one detached

itself from the side of Monte Rotaro, overhanging a part of the VaUone Ombrasco.

Two others started near the summit of Monte Nuovo (of Ischia) and swept down

its north-eastern and north-western flanks, destroying a large tract of vine-gardens.

In the former case the landslip occurred through the loose fragmentary ejectamenta

of Monte Rotaro, whereas in the other two cases the materials were the much
altered Epomeo tufas, that have been for centuries exposed to the destructive

fumarolic action. This latter gave rise to some extraordinary exaggerations, such

as enormous fissures opening, from wliicli large volumes of vapour were issuing, and
similar statements. Tlie fissures were such as exist along the edge of all landslips,
and the vapour which escaped, /or only afeiv hours after, was nothing more than due

to the sudden exposure of a large surface of hot and moist muddy tufa, which formed
the fumarole walls. The author visited with diligence, guided by the informers,
the ditl'erent localities where these natural wonders were to he seen, to be repaid by
useless cUmbs beneath a broiling August sun. As he knew the islaud of Ischia step
by step before the last catastrophe, so far as his observations go, he could tind no

change either in the level of any locality, or in the fumaroles or mineral waters.

     It may be remarked that this is said in the face of many statements to the con-

trary, to the effect that some of the thermal waters boiled, or rushed out in great

quantity. Now there are many persons thoroughly worthy of belief who assert

such to have been the case ; but there are others quite as worthy of belief who deny

it.  Amongst                                               some assertions,  one was  that  the wells     dried  up but           in  two
                                                                                                                               ;

cases at least the u-ells turned out to be underground cisterns for rain water, so

that how the earthquake dried up these, other than by fracturing them, the author

cannot conceive.

     Hardly any cliff' edge but either slipped away or was ffssured parallel to its
borders ; roads that ran along a declivity had either slipped down bodily into the

valley, or were divided by fissures parallel to their axis.

     One fact, however, of which there can exist not the slightest doubt, is possibly
an important discovery made by Dr. Eisig, trained to scieutihc observation, and-

Mr. Petersen, the vice-director and engineer respectively of the zoological station

at Naples. These gentlemen, when on a dredging excursion, with the aquarium

yacht, a short time after the earthquake, noticed on the north of the island (i.e.
opposite Casamicciola and Lacco) a number of pieces of fresh-looking pumice floating

on the water. The conclusion was that there had been a submarine eruption.
Thus would be explained the sensation of a blow struck at the two steamers at
anchor in the roads at the moment of the shock, be.sides that against a boat three

miles from the Punta Imperatore.

    Against such supposition there are many facts. (1) No one saw the eruption.

(2) Supposing it to have passed unobserved in the night, surely the next mornincr
there would still have been some very considerable escape of eruptive materials,

especially when we remember the small depth between the island and the mainland.

We(3) should expect a larger amount of pumice than was really found. (4) It

is hardly compatible that a mesoseismal area occurred within the island, whilst an

eruption occurred a small distance away, unless this were on the continuation of

the fissure, and therefore opposite Lacco. (5) The presence of floating piunice

might be explained by the landslips of loose tufa, containing that material, that

forms the sea cliffs in the immediate neighbourhood, and out of which it may have

floated.

     It is, however, to be hoped that, as the zoological station possesses dredges and
diving apparatus, they wiU divert their attention for a day or two to the investiga-

tion of an important phenomenon, if such really exists.

     Fontana, as on the occasion of March 4, 1881, again showed a set of injuries

dependent on a vertical shock. This time, however, the damage was much more

strongly marked, and many houses were rendered quite uninhabitable, besides some

that fell. In addition to the vertical injm-ies were a set of fractures denoting a wave-

path, coming from the north at a very low angle of emergence. The explanation

proposed for the pecidiarity of the injuries in this locality for 1881, seems to be

confirmed                                                  the vertical seems to be due, as then, to the  conduction along a column

of trachyte followed by the direct shock tr-om Casamenella, which produced the

Ansecond set of fissures.                                  additional confirmation of this is, that at the convent

of St. Nicola hardly any signs of vertical movement are evident, whilst objects on

the altar gave a distinct north and south azimuth.

     The author examined the whole of the coast of the island, but could find no ap-

Aparent change of level. rough examination of the azimuths proves them to be very

regular except near the mass of trachyte of Zale, which seems to have reflected the
shock, so that the buildings in the neighbourhood of it, and especially on its

southern side, have received a direct and reflected wave-path, and therefore have

two sets of fissui-es, causing much complication. The author observed a similar

efi"ect, but much less marked, in 1881.

The focus seems to have been an enlargement of the former one, and occupies, he

believes, almost the same topographical position, except that its northern extremity

Anis more prolonged.  important fact about the position of this fissure is that it

nearly corresponds at its southern end witli the active fumarolic area of Monte

Cito, and at its northern with some altered tufas, the result of fumarolic action on

the beach at Lacco, and therefore is probably along an old fracture, for, at Monte

Cito, alum was collected in the fourteenth or fifteenth century.

   5. Dtjas versus Permian. By the Rev. A. Ieying, B.A., B.Sc, F.G.S.

     This subject is brought forward for discussion both as having a special local
interest, and on account of the international importance of the subject in view

of the Berlin Congress next year, and the progress of the Geological Map of Europe.

The author, referring to previous papers in the ' Geological Magazine ' during the
year 1882, in which strong reasons were given for abandoning the threefold division
of the so-called Permian System, and to the discussions raised in the same periodical,
maintains that the ' Permian System ' of Murchison, which represents the group
of strata as marked by three stages, is inapplicable to the English rocks of Post-
504 REPORT-- 1883.

carboniferous age. This conclusion does not invalidate the correctness of Murchison's

classification for the strata of the Permian region proper; though it must be borne in

mind that during last year Mr. Twelvetrees showed, both in the ' Geological

Magazine ' and in a paper read before the Geological Society, that further south,
in the Orenburg country, a true Dyassic facies, as it is imderstood in Germany,
can be recognised ; the Rothliegende (with some subordinated limestones, as in
Germany) being succeeded upwards by a true Zechstein formation, the latter being

overlain conformably by a series of cupriferous marls and sandstones (' Upper
Permian' of Murchison). The data given by Mr. Twelvetrees are all in favour

of the view which regards these marls and sandstones as a transition series between
the Dyas and Trias, which very nearly coincides with the views expressed by

M. Jules Marcou at the time when Murchison's ' Permian System was first
propounded. Reference is also made to the transition series of Giimbel, which

occurs in Southern Tyrol, described by the author in a paper on the Triassic Deposits

of the Alps in the ' Geological IMagazine,' November 1882, and in his Report to the
British Committee of the International Geological Commission. In both of these
papers the general equivalence of the English Post-carboniferous and the German

Dyas is pointed out, reasons for such a conclusion having been given in the earlier
papers more at length. The term ' Permian ' has therefore only a local and
subordinate value, and scarcely applies even to the whole Russian area in which

these strata are developed.

     This summer the author has spent some time at work upon the German and

Austrian series of Post-carboniferous rocks, and has had the able assistance of

Dr. Von Hauer, Professor Geinitz, Professor Liebe, and others. The main pur-
pose of the present communication is to bring forward new facts bearing upon the

relation of the Dyas and Trias of Central Europe. These facts have been gleaned

(1) from a study of the collections of the Geologische Reichsanstalt of "Vienna;
(2) from a recent communication to the Isis in Dresden by Professor Geinitz,
containing a description by Hr. A. Dittmarsch of the extensive erosion of the

Upper Zechstein (Plattendolomit) at Ostrau, in Silesia; (3) from a series of
quarries near Meerane in Saxony, which the author (at the suggestion of Pro-

fessor Geinitz) has lately visited, and in which tlie unconformity of the lowest

Bunter strata (Murchison's ' Bunterschiefer ') with the Zechstein is most pro-

nounced  and  unmistakable  (sections were  described)                                           (4) from  a week's work  in
                                                                                              ;

Northern Thuringen, where, both in detail and on a larger scale, the break in the

stratigraphical sequence of the Dyas and Trias is shown to be absolute and

complete. The German terminology {Dyas and Trias), which was first established
on a consideration of their organic remains, is thus fully confirmed by physical and
stratigraphical evidence, and the idea of a conformable sequence of the Bunter

upon the Zechstein, which has been so strongly insisted upon by Murchison and his
collabo7-ateurs, is shown to be a fiction. From which it follows that the application

of the ' Permian System,' as propounded by Murchison, to the Post-carboniferous

rocks of Central Em-ope is no longer tenable, any more than is its application to
the British series, as the author has shown elsewhere.

    6. On the Coloration of some Sands, and the Cementation of Siliceous
            Sandstones. By the Rev. A. Irving, B.A., B.Sc, F.G.8.

     In the first part of this paper attention is drawn to the occurrence of certain
green-coloured sands which are frequently met with below the peaty layers, at the
heads of the small valleys, in the Upper Bagshot sands. The local and exceptional
nature of these green deposits, and their relation to the decomposing vegetal
matter wliich has overlain them for a long period of time, suggest the connection
of the green colour with the decomposition of vegetation. Chemical analysis of
these sands shows that the green colour is in no way connected with any of the
ordinary green minerals which enter into the formation of rocks, but reveals the
organic origin of the colouring matter. For details of this, reference is made to
papers by the author, one read before the Geologists' Association, the other in the
                                                          TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                                                           505

* Geological Magazine,' in -n-hicli the matter is treated at length. The green sands

are simply dirty quartz-sand, with more or less of fine clayey material. By

boiling in concentrated sulphuric acid the colour is quite destroyed, and the acid

blackened : long boiling in caustic potash also removes the green colouring

matter for the most part, but leaves some grains coated with a black amorphous

substance, which the author considers to be hinnic acid, perhaps in combination

with the silica. Both the black and the green materials, which appear only as

incrustations of the grains under the microscope, often cementing smaller grains

to the larger ones, can be removed by chemical reagents, and microscopic

examination then shows a pure sand, made up partly of rounded, partly of

angular grains, and exhibiting no trace of colour beyond a thin translucent pellicle

of peroxide of iron after treatment with potash. Not a single grain of any green

mineral has been found by the author in the green sands of either the valley-heads,

or of the Middle and Lower Bagshot series, which both chemical and microscopic

examination prove to owe the green, olive-green, and black coloration of their

grains to amorphous matter of vegetable origin. Crenic and apocrenic acids are

precipitated from the alkaline solutions in which these sands have been boiled, as

well as from the waters of deep wells which are supplied from the Middle and

Lower Bagshot strata where the green sands predominate ; and the proportion of

crenic acid increases with the increase of the depth of shade of the green colour of

the sand as a whole. The paper on the action of humus acids by A. A. Julien
(Am. Ass. Sci., 1879) is referred to, as confirming generally the author's

conclusions on this part of the subject. The author has extended his observations

to certain other sands, and shown that in them too the colouring matter is

largely due to the influence of these vegetal acids. These include the grey sand-

stones of the Molasse, near Lucerne, the green marls of the Upper Keuper, and

a bed of dark green sand in the Woolwich and Reading beds near Croydon.

Evidence is also given of the part they seem to have played in the ' mottling ' of

certain sandstones, and the contemporaneous coloration of the red sandstones

generally, by the formation of soluble ferrous salts, from which the peroxide of
iron was afterwards precipitated by atmospheric oxidation in shallow waters.

To their action is also attributed the bleaching out of iron from the surface sands,

and its subsequent deposition at no great depth, to form the cementing material

of the ' pan ' which is so frequently met with below the superficial layer of sandy

districts in the Bagshot country, in Scotland, in America, and elsewhere.

In the second part of the paper attention is drawn to some recent investigations

by the author, of the origin of the siliceous cementing material of the sarsen-stones,
which occur in the newest Bagshot strata and in the sandy strata of theWoolwich and

Reading beds of the London basin. Reference is made to a fuller statement of

the author's views in the paper before referred to. Looking to the facts (1 ) that
(as the author has demonstrated) silica can be replaced and precipitated in the

hydrated condition from soluble alkaline silicates by saturating their solutions

examination of tliin sections of sarsen-stones shows them to be composed of

clear quartz-grains enclosed in a glassy siliceous matrix; (4) that felspars (as is

well  knovra) are                               decomposed            by  CO, with    deposit  of  kaolin                            (5) that  kaolin  is

--abundantly present in the siliceous matrix in which the quartz-grains are included

· the author regards the induration of these sarsen-stones, and perhaps of siliceous

sandstones and grits generally, as due to the accidental presence of felspar in the
sand as it was originally deposited, and to the decomposition of this, with

simultaneous liberation of silica and kaolin by carbon dioxide, and by the still
stronger humus acids, which must have been copiously supplied by decomposing

vegetation.

          7. On a Boulder from the Ghloritic Marl vf AsJiwell, Herts.
                           By H. George Fordham, F.G.S.

    The boulders which are occasionally found in the Ghloritic Marl in the workings
for the so-called coprolites in Cambridgeshire and the neighbouring counties are
                                                                                                                                                                          --

usually little more than pebbles. In the descriptive list of the more important of
these boulders and pebbles given in a paper read before the Geological Society, in

November 1872, by Messrs. W. J. Sollas and A. J. Jiikes-Browue ('On the In-

cluded Rock-fragments of the Cambridge Upper Greensand,' Quarterly Journal of
the Geological Society, vol. xxix. p. 11), the largest specimen mentioned has the

dimensions 14 x 12 x inches.

    The boulder now noted measures 12 x 9i x 5^ inches, and is therefore amongst
the largest at present known from this bed. It is somewhat triangular in general
form, one siu-face being nearly flat, and is very much romided and worn. On the
weathered surface dark, purple, wavy hnes appear, generally of the thickness of

a sheet of writing paper, but sometimes a quarter, or even half an inch thick, alter-

nating with lighter and thicker bands. Where broken the rock is more uniform in
colour, the bands varying in shades of purple. Occasionally, where much weathered,
the lighter bands show a tendency to columnar structure, developed perpendicularly
to the planes of banding. The material is very hard, and not easUy broken. The
surface of the boulder is worn and smoothed, and in some parts may almost be said
to be polished. Here and there the softer material of the light-coloured bands has
been worn into small cavities or depressions, and in other places the lines of banding
are brought into strong relief by a more uniform wearing away of the softer

bands.

    As is usually the case with the boulders and fossQ remains of the Chloritic
Marl, this specimen has upon its surface a number of attached plicatulae and other
small shells, and it bears also two patches of the phosphatic nodules characteristic

of the bed from which it has been obtained, and even a fragment of the marl itself.
     While the boulder has clearly been subjected to very great wear, and has the

external appearance usually attributed to the action of ice when found in similar
boulders of more recent periods, there are upon it no distmct or definite scratches

or grooves.

     Professor Boimey has kindly examined a fragment from this boulder. The
material is a very compact quartz-felsite, containing small specks of quartz scattered
in the matrix, which exhibits a distinct and interesting spherulitic structiu-e. In
concluding his notes on the boulder. Professor Bonney savs:-- 'The microscopic
structure of the rock difl'ers very decidedly from any specimen which I have
examined from Ohamwood. It differs also from the old rhyolitic rocks of the
"Wrekin and of North Whales. Although it has a certain family likeness to all of
these, enough to embolden one to suggest that it may have been derived from some
volcanic mass, now lost to sight, which was active in the latest pre-Cambrian epoch,
I cannot venture to refer it to any locality known to me in Britain. I have, however,
no doubt that the pebble described by Mr. W' atts ' (' Geological Magazine,' vol. viii.

p. 95) ' is from the same locality.'
     Taken alone, no theoiy as to the prevalence or otherwise of floating ice in the

sea of the period during wliich the lower part of the chalk was deposited can
be founded on this particular boulder. But it at all events supports the abeady
existing theory, based on the character of the boulders and pebbles already de-
scribed from the Chloritic Marl. It has two characteristics of ice-borne erratics :

sources by ice, and subjected to the pecuUar wear and tear incident to ice-action.
2. Its material is derived from a parent rock which can under no probable circiim-
stances have existed, at the period of the chalk, within a very considerable distance
of its recently discovered resting-place. W^e may therefore fairly, I think, accept

it as evidence of the probability of the existence of floating ice in the sea of the

chalk period.

1. On a sup-posed case oj MetamorpMsm, in an Alpine Roch of Carloniferous
                  Age. By Professor T. G. Bonnet, M.A., F.B.8}

     At the base of the Carboniferous series in some parts of the Western .\lps is a

conglomerate called the poiidingue de Val Orsine, the matrix of which abounds in
mica, and is supposed by some geologists to exhibit true foliation. The author
had examined some typical localities near Vernayaz, and stated that the fragments
consisted of vein-quartz, gneiss, and mica schist, resembling the crystalline rocks of
the district, with some of an unaltered purplish slate. Further, microscopic
examination showed that the ground mass exhibited no metamorphism ef

importance, but that the mica was also of fragmental origm. He also described
a green flinty argiUite from the same district, supposed to be a member of the

Carboniferous series. This proved to have been composed originally of fragments

much coarser than he should have expected from the aspect of the rock. These had

been cracked and more or less crushed in situ by the pressiu'e to which the whole
district has been subjected, and had then undergone certain micro-mineralogical

changes. He concluded by stating as the result of his investigations of the Alps,

that there is always an abrupt transition from the comparatively unmetamorphosed
rocks of known geological age to the true schists and gneisses of unknown but
certainly far greater antiquity, and that nothing short of the clearest proof would
"ustifj- us in considering any of the crystalline foliated rocks of the Alps as altered

K"'evonian or Silurian, even if the latter term be used in its most extended sense.

                  2. Note on the Nagel-flue of the Bigi and Bossherg.

                     By Professor T. G. Bonnet, M.A., F.B.S.^

     The author called attention to the following points in regard to the conglomerate

--of these mountains : (1) That the pebbles were not seldom indented by mutual

pressure. This he considered, like the indentations common on the quartzite pebbles
of the Bunter conglomerate of Central England, to be sufficient to show that such
impressions did not indicate an early stage of metamorphism in the ordinary sense

of that word, as argued last year by Professor James Thomson,^ but were simply
deformations due to long-continued pressure apart from any action of heat.
(2) That the pebbles in this district consisted mainly of grits and limestones from
the Secondary and perhaps early Tertiary series of the Alps, with a variable
amount of a reddish granite (of whose locality he was ignorant). Alpine schists

and gneisses were exceedingly rare. He concluded that the nagel-flue was deposited

by a river, whose drainage area had some correspondence with that of the present
Reuss, and its pebbles show that this Miocene river must have flowed almost wholly
over the more modern Alpine rocks. These have now been stripped away from
the underlying metamorphic series over a large extent of the basin of the -Reuss.
(3) That there was a close analogy between the Bunter conglomerate and the
nagel-flue : the former also resembling the British Old Eed Sandstone, and a part
of the Caiciferous sandstone series in Scotland. As these three were admittedly
fresh-water deposits, he argued that the Bunter series (parts of which had some
resemblance to the ordinary molasse) should be reckoned among the true fluviatile

or fluvio-lacustrine deposits.

             3. On the Pre- Cambrian Igneous Bocks of St. David''s.
                       By Professor J. P. Blake, M.A., F.G.8.

     The rocks below the Cambrian conglomerate have been described by
Dr. Hicka as bedded rocks belonging to three distinct periods. The same rocks

have been recently asserted by Dr. Geikie to be partly Cambrian and partly

intrusive. The author contends that they are Precambrian iu age, but form a

very complete volcanic series, which may well be designated the Dimetian.

The basis of the series is the Dimetian granite, serving as the core. This is

surrounded by the more acid rocks, as the quartz-felsites and felspar porphyries

(the so-called Arvonian), and the more outlying portions consist of very varying

--materials, chiefly rough ashes or agglomerate breccias on the east side finely

bedded ' halleflintas,' and on the north side many basic lava flows. These are the

so-called ' Pebdian.' The arrangement of these rocks shows the characteristic

irregularity of volcanic rocks, and though many portions are bedded, they have no

dominant strike over the whole district. The Cambrian series commencing with

the conglomerates is quite independent and hangs together as a whole. In no

place can a continuous passage                             be  proved                                                                                                                                   from  the  one  series  to  the other                                        the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

j unction is in most cases a faulted one, and at the places where this is not so, the

conglomerate lies on different beds of the volcanic series.

     The proofs of the Precambrian age of the volcanic series may be seen (1)

between Nun's Chapel and Caerbwdy, whei-e the junction is faulted towards the

west, so that more and more of the series above the felspar-porphyries comes in

towards the east, and the conglomerate contains fragments of it at Caerbwdy

rocks, and conglomerate (of peculiar character) are equally let down amongst the

ashes; (6) along the northern boundary of the mass, where different members of

the Cambrian series come in contact with it.

The granite is nowhere intrusive, or in any way connected with the Cambrian

rocks. It cannot even be proved intrusive in the volcanic series. The section at

Ogof Llesugn shows a double fault of great magnitude forming the boundary of

the granite as far as Porthclais, with a mass of conglomerate wedged in between

the two faidts, both of which are slickensided. The apparent welding of the

conglomerate to the granite is due to the intrusion of the diabase along the faidt

which has caught up portions of each. This is the only place (except at Porth-

seli, where it has become schistose, perhaps by faulting) where there is any notable

alteration in the quartz-conglomerate. The other junctions, whether at the faults

or at the boundaries of the crystalline rocks, show little or no change. There is no

proof of an isocline west of the granitic mass, but of a very variable series of

ashes and lavas, with interstratified calcareous bands. None of the crystalline

portions of the series show any signs of true bedding. The Cambrian beds which

can be compared to tuffs, though they have not been proved to be such, are far

away from the base of the series, and bear no relation to the underlying ashes.

Similar phenomena to these are repeated further to the east, iu the localities

--pointed out by Dr. Ilicks. Hence in these ancient times there was a tendency to a

linear arrangement of volcanic outbursts the central and older portions are more

crystalline and acid, while the ashes and more basic flows, with the stratified

siliceous tuffs, form the outworks round each centre. On the possibly denuded sur-

face of these rocks the Cambrian beds were deposited, the conglomerates deriving at

least their matrix from them ; and at a later date the vertical direction was given

to them by the forcing up of the great volcanic series to their level, in some places

the granitic base, at others only the ashy surface. At this, or at some later

period, the diabase dykes invaded both.

                4. On the Gedlogij of the Troad. By J. S. Diller.

     This paper gave a brief account of recent researches in the Troad, the author
being attached as geologist to the United States Assos Expedition. Further
details, especially as regards the igneous rocks, were submitted to the Geological
                                                                 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                                        CtOd

Society of London in May last ; ^ other notices on the subject have been published

in the papers of the Archaeological Institute of America.

     The oldest rocks of the Troad are the crystalline schists with limestones which

form the Ida range (5,750 feet), and Avhich also appear in smaller and lower areas

elsewhere. From the limestone-beds of this series, on the flanks of Ida, most of the

springs arise which are the sources of the chief rivers of the Troad. The age of

this series  is  unknown                                         it is probably Archaean.
                                                              ;

Resting unconformably upon these beds, and in part composed of them, is a

newer series of partially altered rocks, which may range in age from Palaeozoic to

Eocene ; but this series requires more examination.
     The Upper Tertiaries are sharply marked off from these older rocks ; they occur

in two separate areas. The older series is marine ; it is found mainly along the

western and north-western part of the Troad. These beds belong to the Sarmatian

--stage Upper Miocene. The newer Tertiary series is composed of fresh-water beds,

Upper Miocene or Lower Pliocene, occurring mainly in the interior of the country,

and especially along the plane of the Mendere.

The oldest igneous rock is granite, which invades and alters the oldest

(? Archaean) crystalline rocks. Dykes of quartz-porphyry intersect this. Quartz-
diorite invades the second, or partially crystalline, sedimentary series.

Of the newer igneous rocks undesit.es and Uparites are the oldest ; where they

can be studied together the latter is the later of the two. Of later date are basalts

and nepheline basalts.

5. On the Causes of Change of CUmatiire during Long Periods of Time, and
        of Coincident Changes of Fauna and Flora. By John Gunn.-

     The object is to show that, as the elevation of mountain- ranges is the principal

--cause of cold, so the converse is true namely, that their subsidence, in long periods

of time, is the cause of warm temperatures.

     Without attempting to account for the origin of the inequalities of the earth's

surface, or to throw any light upon the cause of the upheaval of the land, the author
endeavours to prove the reality of his proposition, and commences with the Carboni-

ferous period.

There is evidence of a normal and quiescent state during which coal was de-

posited ; not an instance can be adduced of an ice-scratched boulder, but a mild and

subtropical climate appears to have prevailed.

Passing to the Permian, the change both of faima and flora appears to be coin-
Acident with that of the level of the land.
                                                                                           great and general disturbance took

place, and glaciated and striated rocks prove the reality of a Glacial period, as ob-

served by Professor Eamsay.

From that era, and throughout the oolitic series, a gradual and general levelling

occurred, and there is no appearance of scratched boulders. Marsupial animals

attest a subtropical surface of the land, and saurians indicate the like condition of

the sea. Throughout the Purbeck beds the marsupial form is continued, and in the

Dirt-bed of the Isle of Portland the Zamia represents a tropical flora.

    The same remarks may be made respecting the prevalence of a warm climate

during the cretaceous series. The chalk was laid down in a warm sea horizontally,

and its elevation into its present inclined and irregular position was accompanied

with a lowering of the climate and concurrent change of fauna and flora.

The Eocene and still more the Miocene formations exhibit very gradually but

decidedly the effect of change of level and disturbance of the strata, but no striated

boulders that the wiiter is aware of, nor any indication of ice-action have been

discovered in them.

     But the effect of such changes becomes more obvious in Pliocene times ; and in

no part of the world are there the like facilities for observation as in the eastern
counties of England. There, from the continuity of the strata, the relations of

cause and effect are minutely traceable, and it may be clearly seen how the varia-

tions of the climate and of the fauna and flora have gone ;)rt>7 passu with the
elevation of the land. This is exemplified in the variety of the elephantine and
cervine remains which were successively entombed in the great Anglo-Belgian
basin. After that deposit the land was evidently upheaved, so that on the west
the estuary was raised high and dry without the river, and on the east there is
the remnant of the mighty Rhine without the estuary.

   A severance has taken place, caused by this elevatoi-y process, between the

elephantine and cervine remains on either side of the Alpine ranges. This may be
seen in Germany, Italy, and other countries on the east, and in the Thames valley,

the Forest-bed in England, and in several districts in France and elsewhere on the

west. Both mammals and molluscs had an extensive range before the mountains
were raised and intercommunication was cut oft".

     The result of this upheaval was the introduction of the so-called Glacial
epoch, when the greater part of the mammals succumbed to the cold, and an ice-
sheet by land and glaciers by sea spread the temperature of the Ice Age far and wide.

     The reality of this scene and its cause are shown by the gradual introduction
of the present milder temperature, which has succeeded on the wearing down of
the level of perpetual snow and the retreat of glaciers. This may be observed by

every traveller in Switzerland, Savoy, Italy, and Greece ; and we appear to have

returned to the same temperature as prevailed during the Forest-bed period after
having experienced here the severity of subarctic regions.

     In^Central North America the elevation of the land, 2,000 feet, has sufficed to

chano-e the course of the Gulf Stream. By this the current of warm water is
diverted to its present course, and we now enjoy the benefits which once spread

their genial influence in the direction of Melville Island. Tliis change suggests the
best solution of that extraordinary phenomenon the growth of coal-plants in so

northerly a latitude.

6. Preliminary Note on the further discovery of Vertebrate Footprints in the

                  'Penrith Sandstone. By Geokge Vartt Smith.

    For some time past the author had been endeavouring to find footprints in the
Penrith sandstone, knowing that impressions of the same nature as those met with
in the equivalent strata of Dumfries had been previously found at Brownrigg in
Plumpton, about five miles to the north of Penrith, and that similar impressions
had also been noticed by the late Mr. Binney and by Prof Harlniess on the flaggy
beds near Penrith, but that those impressions were not so distinct as at Brownrigg.

    Last May he was fortunate enough to meet with some impressions in a quarry
which had been opened out when the Settle and Carlisle branch of the Midland

Railway was in course of construction. This quarry is situated on the slope of
the hill north of the highway from Penrith to Alston, and about three and a lialf
miles east from Penrith. The rock consists wholly of strongly false-bedded red
sandstone, similar in character to that so largely employed for building purposes
in and around the town of Penrith.

     The o-eological position of the sandstone was shown approximately in the diagram
which was exhibited. It is important to notice that the Penrith sandstone occurs
beneath the magnesian limestone, the latter being found in the bank of the river
Eden between Throstle Hall and Little Salkeld, to the north-east of the quarry,
us well as in Hilton Beck, near Appleby. Nearly all the footprints hitherto found

in the New Red have been obtained from the so-called Trias, and it is of great

interest to find vestiges of a similar nature occurring in rocks clearly older than the

magnesian limestone.
      Facsimile casts of several impressions, showing the peculiar characteristics of

each were exhibited at the meeting, together with sketches of the stones upon
which the impressions occur, serving to show the direction of the tracks.

     The first impression (cast No. 1) was found loose on the top of the bed where the
workmen had been quarrying. From the impressions subsequently found in situ
it would appear to be the cast, or top stone. Subsequently the author found im-

Apressions on the bed marked in the water-colour sketch of the quarry.

   AThe casts Nos. 2 and 3 are from the hed marked in the annexed sketch of the

quan-y. No. 4 is from bed B, and Nos. 5, 6, and 7 are from the bed C. The casts
Nos. 8 and 9 are of stones taken from the same quarry by the workmen, but
they informed the author that the original of No. 9

was found below bed A, and was a bottom stone.

The impressions in the three beds take the same,

or nearly the same, direction.

The impressions seen in the casts 1, 3, and 5

appear to be those of similar animals, which evi-

dently used their fore feet simply as supports, while

throwing- the weight of their bodies mainly on their

hind feet, which when in motion over-reached the

impressions left by the fore feet. Nos. 2 and 6 to

all appearance do not exhibit the same character, the

impressions being probably those of a single foot;

those on No. 6 would appear to be the impression of           looking s.w.

a pad and three digits. The impressions on No. 4,
being of more uniform depth, would appear to have been made by an animal
which threw its weight pretty equally on all four feet. The impressions on
No. 7 appear different again, and to have been those of a much smaller animal.

It is important to note that the impressions Nos. 6, 6, and 7, being all different,
occur on the same stone. The impressions on No. 8 are from their position

very different to any of the others. It seems doubtful whether each impres-

sion on No. 9 is that of a single foot, or whether it is not rather that of both
the fore and hind feet nearly in coincidence. The appearance of a double row of
toes and the abnormal number of six digits visible in some impressions probably

ai-ises from the placing of the hind foot nearly in the impression left by the fore-

foot                 or, again, the impression may represent the pad and toes of a single foot.  It
                  ;

is of interest to note the variety of forms of animal. life represented in the present

specimens, a variety that compares very favourably with the small range of forms
represented by the impressions hitherto obtained from rocks higher in the series.

It has been suggested that these represent the vestiges of at least several different

species, if not of different genera, of extinct vertebrates.

     I had, previously to this, found an impression (^No. 10) in the higher number of
the same series overlying the magnesian limestone, and known as the St. Bee's

sandstone, about a mile south-west of the village of Hilton, on the road to

Appleby. It was not in situ, but a subsequent visit to the same place convinced
me that it must have been quarried from a quarry on the spot. The same quarry

has yielded several stones exhibiting desiccation-marks and also portions of foot-

prints.

             7. ArcJicBastacus Willeincesii, a New Genus of JEryonidce.
                               By C. Spence Bate, F.B.S.

     The species of Eryon hitherto described seem to belong to separate genera, as
different from one another as from some recent forms.

    The specimen now described is from the Lower Lias of Lyme Regis, and it

seems to connect the fossil forms with those recent ones brought to light, through
deep-sea exploration, more than any other form does.

     The animal appears to have had no eye, but the presence of an orbital concavity
shows that it has retrograded from a species in which the eye was an important

feature.

    The genus is allied to Polycheles, which it resembles as much as it does the

ancient Eryon.

     It seems, therefore, that Eryon has departed from an unknown ancestor of Astacus,
and that the recent Polycheles is in direct descent from the Liassic Arckceastacus.

tion to open the proceedings of the departments with the chairmanship of which

they are charged, by formal addresses. In retlecting on the topics which it might

be desirable for me to bring under your notice, as your president, on the present

occasion, it has occurred to me that I might use this opportunity most fitly by

departing somewhat from the prevailing custom of reviewing the progress of science

in some special direction dm-ing the past year ; and that instead of placing before

you a summary of the results recently obtained by the investigations of biologists

in this or that line of inquiry, I might ask your attention and that of the external

public (who are wont to give some kindly consideration to the opinions expressed

on these occasions) to a matter which is even more directly connected with the

avowed object of our Association, namely, ' the Advancement of Science.' I pro-

pose to place before you a few observations upon the provision which exists in this

Dcountry for the advancement of that branch of science to which Section is dedi-

--cated namelj'. Biology.

I am aware that it is usual for those who speak of men of science and their

pursuits to ignore altogether such sordid topics as the one which I have chosen to

Abring forward.  certain pride on the one hand, and a willing acquiescence on the

other hand, usually prevents those who are professionally concerned with scientific

pursuits from exposing to the public the pecuniary destitution and the consequent

crippling and languor of scientific research in this country. Those Englishmen who

take an interest in the progress of science are apt to suppose that, in some way

which they have never clearly understood, the pursuit of scientific truth is not

only its own reward, but also a sufficient source of food and clothing. Whilst

they are interested and amused by the remarkable discoveries of scientific men,

they are astonished whenever a proposal is mentioned to assign salaries to a few

such persons, sufficient to enable them to live decently whilst devoting their time

and strength to investigation. The public are becoming more and more anxious to

have the opinion or report of scientific men upon matters of commercial importance,

or in relation to the public health ; and yet in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred

they expect to have that opinion for the asking, although accustomed to pay ether

professional men handsomely for similar service. There is, it appears, in the public

mind a vague belief that men who occupy their time with the endeavour to add to

knowledge in this or that branch of science are mysteriously supported by the State

excliequer, and are thus fair game for attacking with all sorts of demands for gra-

tuitous service ; or, on the other hand, the notion at work appears sometimes to be

-- --that the making of new knowledge in fact, scientific discovery is an agreeable

pastime, in which some ingenious gentlemen, whose business in other directions takes

up their best hours, find relaxation after dinner or on the spare hours of Sunday.

Such mistaken views ought to be dispelled with all possible celerity and determina-

tion. It is in part owing to the fact that the real state of the case is not widely

and persistently made known to the public, that no attempt is made in this country

to raise scientific research, and especially biological research, from the condition of

--destitution and neglect under which it sufiers a condition which is far below

that of these same interests in France and Germany, and even in Holland, Belgium,
Italy, and Russia, and is discreditable to England in proportion as she is richer

than other States.

    It appears to me that, in placing this matter before you, I may remove myself

from any suggestion of self-interest by at once stating that the great defect to

which I shall draw your attention is not that the few existing public positions
which are open in this country to men who intend to devote their chief energies

to biological research are endowed with iusufheient salaries ; but that there is
not anything like a sufficiently laj-ge number of those posts, and that there is in that

respect, from a national point of view, a pecuniary starvation of biology, a withhold-

ing of money which (to use another metaphor) is no less the sinews of the war of
science against ignorance than of other less glorious campaigns. Surely men
engaged in the scientific profession may advocate the claim of science to main-
tenance and needfid pecuniary provision ! It seems to me that we should, if

necessary, swallow, rather than be controlled by, that pride which tempts us to paint

the scientific career as one far above and  independent of  pecuniary considerations
                                                                                                                                                                                ;

whereas all the while we know that knowledge is languishing, that able men are

drawn off" from scientific research into other careers, that important discoveries
are approached and their final grasp relinquished, that great men depart and leave
no disciples or successors, simply for want of that which is largely given in other

countries, of that which is most abundant in this country, and is so lavishly ex-

pended on armies and navies, on the development of commercial resources, on a

--hundred mjurious or meaningless charities viz., money.

    I have no doubt that 1 have the sympathy of all my hearers in wishing for more

extensive provision in this country for the prosecution of scientific research, and

especially of biological research. I need hardly remind this audience of the almost

romantic history of some of the great discoveries which have been made in reference

to the nature and history of living things during the past century. The microscope,

which was a drawing-room toy a hundred years ago, has, in the hands of devoted

and gifted students of nature, been the means of giving us knowledge which, on

the one hand, has saved thousands of surgical patients from terrible pain and death,

and, on the other hand, has laid the foundation of that new philosophy with which

the name of Darwin will for ever be associated. When Elirenberg and, later,

Dujardin described and figured the various forms of Monas, Vibrio, Spirillum, and

Bacterium which their microscopes revealed to them, no one could predict that

fifty years later these organisms would be recognised as the cause of that dangerous

suppuration of wounds which so often defeated the beneficent efforts of the surgeon

and made an operation in a hospital ward as dangerous to the patient as residence

in a plague-stricken city. Yet this is the result which the assiduous studies of the

biologists, provided with laboratories and maintenance by continental States, have

in due time brought to light. Theodore Schwann, professor at Liege, first showed

that these Bacteria are the cause of the putrefaction of organic substances, and

subsequently the French chemist Pasteur, professor in the Ecole Normale of Paris,

confirmed and extended Schwann's discovery, so as to establish the belief that all

putrefactive changes are due to such minute organisms, and that if these organisms

can be kept at bay no putrefaction can occur in any given substance.

It was reserved for our countryman Joseph Lister to apply this result to the

treatment of wounds, and by his famous antiseptic method to destroy by means of

special poisons the putrefactive organisms which necessarily find their way into

the neighbourhood of a wound, or of the surgeon's knife and dressings, and to ward

off by similar means the access of such organisms to the wounded surface. The

amount of death, not to speak of the suffering short of death, which the knowledge

of Bacteria gained by the microscope has thus averted is incalcidable.

Yet further, the discoveries of Ehrenberg, Schwann, and Pasteur are bearing fruit

of a similar kind in other directions. It seems in the highest degree probable that

the terrible scourge known as tubercular consumption or phthisis is due to a para-

sitic Bacterium (Bacillus), discovered two years since by Koch of Berlin, as theim-

mediate result of iavestigations whicli he was commissioned to carry on at the

public expense, in the specially erected Laboratory of Public Health, by the
German Imperial Government. The diseases known as erysipelas and glanders or

farcy have similarly, within the past few months in German State-supported

laboratories, been shown to be due to the attacks of special kinds of Bacteria. At

present this knowledge has not led to a successful method of combating those

Wediseases, but we cau hardly doubt that it will ultimately do so.  are warranted

in this belief by the fact that the disease known as ' splenic fever ' in cattle and
' malignant pustule ' or anthrax in man has likewise been shown to be due to the

action of a special kind of Bacterium, and that this knowledge has, in the hands of

MM. Toussaint and Pasteur, led to a treatment in relation to this disease similar

to that of vaccination in relation to small-pox. By cultivation a modified growth

of the anthrax parasite is obtained, which is then used in order to inoculate cattle

and sheep with a mUd form of the disease, such inoculation having the result of

rendering the cattle and sheep free from the attacks of the severe form of disease,

just as vaccination or inoculation with cow-pox protects man from the attack of
the deadly small-pox. One other case 1 may call to mind in which knowledge of the

presence of Bacteria as the cause of disease has led to successful curative treatment.

A not uncommon affliction is inflammation of the bladder accompanied by ammoniacal

decomposition of the urine. Microscopical investigation has shown that this ammo-

niacal decomposition is entirely due to the activity of a Bacterium. Fortunately

this Bacterium is at once killed by weak solutions of quinine, which can be injected

into the bladder without causing any injury or irritation. This example appears

to have great importance, because it is the fact that many kinds of Bacteria are
not killed by solutions of quinine, but require other and much more irritant

poisons to destroy their life, which could not be injected into the bladder without

causing disastrous effects. Since some Bacteria are killed by one poison and some

by another, it becomes a matter of the keenest interest to find out all such poisons ;

and possibly among them may be some which can be applied so as to kill the

Bacteria which produce phthisis, erysipelas, glanders, anthrax, and other scourges

of humanity, whilst not acting injuriously upon the body of the victim in which

these infinitesimal parasites are doing their deadly work. In such ways as this

biology has turned the toy ' magnifying-glass ' of the last century into a saver of

life and health.

    No less has the same agency revolutionised the thoughts of men in every

branch of philosophy and speculation. The knowledge of the growth of the

chick from the egg and of other organisms from similarly constituted beginnings

has been slowly and continuously gained by prodigious labour, extending over

generation after generation of students who have occupied the laboratories and

--lived on the stipends provided by the Governments of European States not English,

but chiefly German. It is this history of the development of the individual animal

and plant from a simple homogeneous beginning to a complex heterogeneous adult

which has furnished the starting-point for the wide-reaching Doctrine of Evolution.

It is this knowledge, coupled with the knowledge of the myriad details of structure

of all kinds of animals and plants which the faithful occupants of laboratories and

--the guardians of biological collections have in the past hundred years laboriously

searched out and recorded it is this which enabled Darwin to propound, to test,

and to firmly establish his theory of the origin of species by natural selection, and

finally to bring the origin, development, and progress of man also into the area

of physical science. I have said enough, in referring only to two very diverse

examples of the far-reaching consequences flowing from the discoveries of single-

minded investigators in biological science, to remind my hearers that in the domain

of biology, as in other sciences, the results attained by those who have laboured

simply to extend our knowledge of the structure and properties of living things, in

the faith that every increase of knowledge will ultimately bring its blessing to

humanity, have in fact led with astonishing rapidity to conclusions afiecting most

profoundly both the bodily and the mental welfare of the community.

   We who know the beneficent results which must flow more and more from the

labours of those who are able to create new knowledge of living things, or, in other

-- --words, are able to aid in the growth of biological science, must feel something

more than regret even indignation that England should do so small a proportion

of the laborious investigation which is necessary, and is being carried on for our

profit by other nationalities. It must not be supposed, because we have had our

Harvey and our Darwin, our Hunter and our Lister, that therefore we have done

and are doing all that is needful in the increase of biological science. The posi-

tion of this country in relation to the progress of science is not to be decided by

the citation of great names.

   We require to look more fully into the matter than this. The question is not

whether England has produced some great discoverers, or as many as any other
nationality, but whether we might not with advantage to our own community and

that of the civilised world generally, do far more in the Held of scientific investiga-

tion than we do.

It may be laid down as a general proposition, to which I know of no important

exception, that scientitic discovery has only been made by one of two classes of

--men, namely (1) those whose time could be devoted to it in virtue of their pos-

sessing inherited   fortunes                                         (2)  those  whose  time could  be devoted to it in virtue
                                                                  ;

of their possessing a stipend or endowment especially assigned to them for that

purpose.

Now it is a very remarkable fact that in England, far more than in any other

country, the possessors of private fortunes have devoted themselves to scientific in-

vestigation. Not only have we in all parts of the country numerous dilettanti^ who,

especially in various branches of biology, do valuable work in continually adding

to knowledge, quietly pursuing their favourite study without seeking to reach

to any great eminence, but it is the feet that many of the greatest names of

English discoverers in science are those of men who held no professional posi-

tion designed to maintain an investigator, but owed their opportunity simply

to the fact that they enjoyed a more or less ample income by inheritance.

Thus, Harvey possessed a private fortune, Darwin also, and Lyell." Such also is

true of some of the English naturalists, who more recently have most successfully

devoted their energies to research. Those who wish to defend the present neglect of

the Government and of public institutions to provide means for the carrying- on

of scientific research in this country, are accustomed to declare as a justification

for this^ neglect that we do very well without such provision, inasmuch as the

cultivation of science here flourishes in the hands of those who are in a position

of pecuniary independence. The reply to this is obvious. If those few of our

countrymen who by accident are placed in an independent position show such

ability in the prosecution of scientific research, how much more would be

effected in the same direction were the machinery provided to enable those also

who are not accidentally favoured by fortune to enter upon the same kind of work.

The nurnber of wealthy men who have distinguished themselves in scientific

research in England is simply evidence that there is a natural ability and liking for
such work in the English character, and is a distinct encouragement to those 'who

have it in their power to do so, to ofler the opportunity of devoting themselves to

research to a larger number of the members of the community. It is impossible to

doubt that there are hundreds of men amongst us who have as gi-eat capacity for

scientific discovery as those whom fortune has favoured with leisure and oppoi-tunity.

It cannot be doubted that were the means provided to enable even a proportion

of such men to give themselves up to scientific investigation, great discoveries
of no less importance to the world than those relative to the causes of disease and

-- --the development of living things from the eg^ which I have cited would be made

as a direct^ consequence of their activity, whereas now we must wait until in due

course of time these discoveries shall be made for us in the laboratories of Germany,

France, or Russia.

It should further be pointed out that it is altogether a mistake to suppose that

     ' I use this word in its best and truest sense, and would refer those who have
been accustomed to associate with it some implication of contempt, to the wise and
appreciative remarks of Goethe on " Dilettanti."

                                                                    2I. X.

the existence amongst us of a few veiy eminent men is any evidence tliat we are

contributing largely to the hard work of carefid study and observation which

really forms the material upon which the conclusions of eminent discoverers are

based. You will find in every department of biological knowledge, that the hard

work of investigation is being carried on by the well-trained army of German

observers. Whether you ask the zoologist, the botanist, the physiologist, or the

anthropologist, you wiU get the same answer : it is to German sources that he looks

for new information ; it is in German workshops that discoveries, each small in

itself, but gradually leading up to great conclusions, are daily being made. To a

very large extent "the business of those who are occupied with teaching or
applying biological science in this country consists in making known what has
been done in German laboratories ; our English students flock to Germany to learn

the  methods  of scientific  research                                          and  to  such  a  state  of  weakness  is  English
                                                                            ;

science reduced for want of proper nurture and support, that even on some of

the rare occasions when a capable investigator of biological problems has been re-

quired for the public service, it has been necessary to obtain the assistance of

a foreigner trained in the laboratories of Germany.

     Let me now briefly explain what are the arrangements, in number and in kind,

which exist in other" countries for the purpose of promoting the advancement

of biological science, which are wanting in this couutry.

     In the German Empire, with a population of 45,000,000, there are twenty-one

universities. These universities are very different from anything which goes by

the name in this country. Amongst its other arrangements devoted to the study

and teaching of all branches of learning and science, each university has five

institutes, or establishments, devoted to the prosecution of researches in biological

science. These are respectively the physiological, the zoological, the anatomical,

the pathological, and the botanical. In one of these universities of average size

each of the institutes named consists of a spacious building containing many rooms

fitted as workshops, provided with instruments, a museum, and, in the last in-

stance, with an experimental garden. All this is provided and maintained by the

State. At the head of each institute is the university professor respectively of
physiology, of zoology, of anatomy, of pathology, or of botany. He is paid a

stipend by the State, which in the smallest university is as low as 120/., but may

be in others as much as 700/., and averages say 400/. a year. Considering the

relative expenditure of the professional classes in the two countries, this average

may be taken as equal to 800/. a year in England.' Besides the professor, each

institute has attached to it, with salaries paid by the State, two qualified assistants,
Awho in course of time will succeed to independent positions.
                                                                                                            liberal allowance

is also made to each institute by the State for the purchase of instruments, material
for study, and for the pay of servants, so that the total expenditure on professor,

assistants, laboratory service, and maintenance, averages 800/. a year for each in-

--stitute reaching as much as 2,000/. or 3,000/. a year in the larger universities. It

is the business of the professor, in conjunction with his assistants and the advanced

students, who are admitted to work in the laboratories free of charge, to cany on

investigations, to create neio knotdedge in the several domains of physiology,

zoology, anatomy, pathology, and botany. It is for this that the professor

receives his stipend, and it is on his success in this field of labour that his promotion

to a more important or better paid post in another university depends. In addi-
tion to and irrespectively of this part of his duties, each professor is charged with

the delivery of courses of lectures and of elementary instruction to the general

students of the university, and for this he is allowed to charge a certain fee to each

student, which he receives himself; the total of such fees may, in the case of a

largely attended university and a popular subject, form a very important addition

to the professorial income ; but it is distinctly to be understood that such payment

    · From the fact that the salaries of judges, civil servants, military and naval
officers, parsons and schoolmasters, as also the fees of physicians and lawyers, are in

Germany even less than half what is paid to the same classes in England, I think that
we are justified in making this estimate.
                            --;

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.  517

 by fees is only an addition to the professor's income, quite independent of his
 stipend and of his regular occupation in the laboratory : it is paid from a separate
 source and for a separate object. There are thus in the German Empire more than

  100 such institutes devoted to the prosecution of biological discovery, carried on at
 an annual cost to the State of about 80,000/., equal to about 160,000/. in England,

 providing posts of graduated value for 300 investigators, some of small value,

 sufficient to carry the young student through the earlier portion of his career,

 whilst he is being trained and acting as the as.sistant of more experienced men

 others forming the sufficient but not too valuable prizes which are the rewards of
 continuous and successful labour.

      In addition to these university institutes, there are in Germany such special

 laboratories of research, with duly salaried staff of investigators, as the Imperial

 Sanitarj' Institute of Berlin, and the large museums of Berlin, Bremen, and other
 large towns corresponding to our own British Museum of Natural History.

      Moreover, we must be careful to note, in making any comparison with the

 arrangements existing in England, that there are, in addition to the universities in
 Germany, a number of other educational institutions, at least equal in number,
 which are knowai as polytechnic schools, technical colleges, and agricultural

 colleges. These furnish posts of emolument to a limited niunber of biological

 students, who give courses of instruction to their pupils, but they have not the
same arrangements for research as the universities, and are closely similar to those

colleges which have been founded of late years in the provincial towns of England,
such as Bristol, Nottingham, and Leeds. The latter are sometimes quoted by

sanguine persons, who are satisfied with the neglected condition of scientific training
and research in this country, as really sufficient and adequate representatives of the
German universities. As a matter of fact, the excellent EngUsh colleges in ques-
tion do not present anything at all comparable to the arrangements of a German
university, and are, in respect of the amount of money which is expended upon
them, the number of their teaching andstaff:' the efficiency of their laboratories,

inferior not merely to the smallest German university, but inferior to many of the

technical schools of that country.

     Passing from Germany, I would now ask your attention for a moment to

an institution which is supported by the French Government, and which

quite irrespective of the French university system, which is not on the whole

superior to our own-- constitutes one of the most effective arrangements in any

European State for the production of new knowledge. The institution to which I
allude is the College de France in Paris--co-existing there with the Sorbonne, the

--Ecole de Medecine, the Ecole Normale, the Jardin des Plantes, and other State-

supported institutions in which opportunity is provided for those Frenchmen who

have the requisite talent to pursue scientific discovery in the department of biology,
and in other branches of science. I particularly mention the College de France,

because it appears to me that the foundation of such a college in London would be

one of the simplest and most direct step? that could be taken towards filhng, in
some degree, the void from which English science suflfers. The College de France
is divided into a literary and a scientific faculty. Each faculty consists of some
twenty professors. Each professor in the scientific faculty is provided with a

laboratory and assistants (as many as four assistants in some cases), and with a

considerable allowance for the expenses of the instruments and materials required
in research. The personal stipend of each professor is 400/., which has been in-
creased by an additional 100/. a year in some cases from the Government Depart-
ment charged with the promotion of higher studies. The professors in this

institution, as in the German universities, when a vacancy occurs, have the right
of nominating their future colleague, their recommendation being accepted by the
Government. The professors are not expected to give any elementary instruction,
but are directed to carry on original investigations, in prosecuting which they may
associate with themselves pupils who are sufficiently advanced to join in such work
and it is further the duty of each professor to give a course of forty lectures in

each year upon the results of the researches in which he is engaged. There are at
present among the professors of the College de France four of the most distinguished
                                                                    :

among contemporary students of biological science : Professor Brown-Sequard,
Professor Marey, Professor Balbiani, and Professor Ixanvier. E^'e^yone who is
acquainted with the progress of discovery in ph3'siology, minute anatomy, and
embryology, will admit that the opportunities alibrded to these men have not been

wasted : they have, as the result of the position in which they have been placed,
produced abundant and most valuable work, and have, in addition, trained younger

men to carry on the same line of activity. It was here, too, in the College de

Prance, that the great genius of Claude i3ernard found the necessary conditions

for its development.

    Let us now see how many and what hind of institutions there are in England
devised so as to promote the making of new knowledge in biological science. Most

persons are apt to be deceived in this matter by the fact that the terms ' university,'

' professorship,' and ' college ' are used very freely in England in reference to institu-

tions which have no pecuniary resources whatever, and which, instead of corre-
sponding to the German arrangements which go by these names, are empty titles,

neither backed by adequate subsidy of the State nor by endowment from private

sources.

     In England, with its 25,000,000 inhabitants, there are only four universities

--which possess endowments and professoriates viz., Oxford, Cambridge, Durham,

and the Victoria (Owens College). Besides these, which are variously and speci-
ally organised each in its own way, there are the London Colleges (University and
King's), the Normal School of Science at South Kensington, and various provincial

colleges, which are to a small and varying extent in possession of funds which could
be or are used to promote scientific research. Amongst all these variously arranged

institutions there is an extraordinarily small amount of provision for biological
research. In London there is one professorship only, that at the Normal School of

Science, which is maintained by a stipend paid by the State, and has a laboratory

and salaried assistants, similarly maintained, in connection wilh it. Tlie only

other posts in London which are provided with stipends intended to enable their

holders to pursue researches in the domain of biological science, are the two chairs

of physiology and of zoology at University College, which, through the mimificence

of a private individual,' have been endowed to the extent of 300/. a year each. To

these should be added, in our calculation, certain posts in connection with the

British Museum of Natural History and the Royal Gardens at Kew, maintained by

the State ; though it must be remembered that a large part of the expenditure in

those institutions is necessarily taken up in the preservation of great national collec-

Wetions, and is not applicable to the subvention of investigators.  may, however,

reckon about six posts, great and small, in the British M\iseum, and four at Kew, as

coming into the category which we have in view. In London, then, we may reckon

approximately some fourteen or fifteen subsidised posts for biological research. In
Oxford there fall under this category the professorship of anatomy and his
assistant, that of physiology, that of zoology, that of botany. The Oxford pro-

fessorships are well supported by endowment, averaging 700/. or 800/. a year but
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

they are inadequately provided with assistants as compared with corresponding

German positions. Whilst Oxford has thus five posts, Cambridge has at present the
same number, though the stipends are of less average value. In regard to Durham,

it does not appear that the biological professorships (which have their seat in the
Newcastle College of Science) are supported by stipends derived from endowment

they fall under another category, to which allusion will be made below, of purely
teaching positions, supported by the fees paid for such teaching by pupils. The

Victoria University (Owens College, Manchester) supports its professoi-s of physi-

ology, anatomy, zoology, botany, and pathology, by means partly of endowment,

partly of pupils' fees. By the provision of adequate laboratories and of salaries for

--professorships, and curatorships together) a total of 38 in all England with

its 25,000,000 inhabitants, as against the 300 in Germany with 45,000,000 in-

habitants. In proportion to its population (leaving aside the consideration of its

greater wealth), England has only about one-fourth of the provision for the advance-

ment of biological research which exists in Germany.

It would not be fair to reckon in this comparison the various biological pro-

fessorships in small colleges recently created, and paid to a small extent by stipends

derived from endowments, in the provincial towns of England : for the holders of

these chairs are called upon to teach a variety of subjects, for instance, zoology,

botany, and geology combined; and not only is the devotion of the energies of their

teaching staff to scientific discovery not contemplated in the arrangement of these

institutions, but, as a matter of fact, the large demands made on the professors in

the way of teaching must deprive them of the time necessary for any serious inves-

tigation. Such posts, in the fact that neither time, assistants, nor proper laboratories

are provided to enable their holders to engage in scientific research, are school-

masterships rather than professorships, as the word is used in German universities.

One result of the exceedingly small provision of positions in England similar

to those furnished by the German university system, and of the irregular, uncer-
tain character of many of those which do exist, is that there is an insufficient supply
of young men willing to enter upon the career of zoologist, botanist, physiologist

or pathologist as a profession. The number of posts is too small to create a pro-

fession, i.e. an avenue of success; and consequently, whereas in Germany there is
always a large body of new men ready to fill up the vacancies as they occur in the

professorial organisation, in England it very naturally does not appear to our

university students as a reasonable thing to enter upon research as a profession,,

when the chances of employment are so few and far between.

Before stating, as I propose to do, what appears to me a reasonable and proper

method of removing to some extent the defect in our national life due to the want

of provision for scientific research, I will endeavour to meet some of the objections-

which are usually raised to such views as those which I am advocating. The

endowment of research by the State, or from public funds of any kind, is opposed

on various grounds. One is that such action on the part of the Government is well

enough in continental States, but is contrary to the spirit of English statecraft,

which leaves scientific as well as other enterprise to the individual initiative of the

people. This objection is based on error, both as to fact and theory. It is well

enough to leave to individual effort the conduct of such enterprises as are remuner-

ative to the parties who conduct  them                         but  it  is  a  mistake  to  speak  of  scientific
                                                            ;

research as an ' enterprise ' at all. The mistake arises from the extraordinary

pertinacity with which so-called ' invention ' is confounded with the discovery of

scientific truth. New knowledge in biological or other branches of science cannot

be sold it has no marketable value.          Koch could not have sold the discovery of
                                          ;

the Bacterium of phthisis for as much as sixpence, had he wished to do so.

Accordingly, we find that there is not, and never has been, any tendency among the

citizens of this country to provide for themselves institutions for the manufacture

of an article of so little pecuniary value to the individual who turns it out as is new
knowledge. On the other hand, as a matter of fact, the providing of means for the

manufacture of that article is not only not foreign to English statecraft, but is largely,

though not largely enough, undertaken by the English State. The Koyal Observa-

tories, the British Museum, the Royal Gardens at Kew, the Geological Survey, the

Government grant of 4,000^. a year to the Royal Society, the 300/. or 400Z. a year

(not a large sum) expended through the medical officer of the Privy Council upon

the experimental investigation of disease, are ample evidence that such providing

of means for creating new knowledge forms part of the natural and recognised re-

sponsibilities of the British Government. Such a responsibility clearly is recognised

in this country, and does fall, according to the present arrangement of things, upon

the central Government. What we have to regret is, that those who temporarily

hold the reins of government fail to perceive the lamentable inadequacy of the mode

in which this responsibility is met.

   A second objection which is made to the endowment of research by public
520 EEPOBT-- 1883.

funds, or by other meaus, such as voluntary contributions, is this : it is stated that

men engaged in scientific research ought to teach, and thus gain their livehhood.

mIt is argued, fact, that there is no need whatever to provide stipends or labora-

tories for researchers, since they have only to stand up and teach in order to make

incomes sufficient to keep them and their families, and to provide themselves with

laboratories. This is a very plausible statement, because it is the fact that some

investigators have also been excellent lecturers, and have been able to make an

income by teaching whilst carrying on a limited amount of scientific investigation.

But neither by teaching in the form of popular lectures, nor by teaching university

or professional students who desire as a result to pass some examination test, is it
possible, where there is a fair field and no favour, for a man to gain a reasonable

income and at the same time to leave himself time and energy to carry on original

investigations in science.

In some universities, such as those of Scotland, the privilege of conferring

degrees of pecuniar}^ value to their possessors becomes a source of income to the

professors of the university ; they are, in fact, able to make considerable incomes,

independently of endowment, by compelling the candidates for degrees to pay a fee

to each professor in tlie faculty for the right of attending his lectures and of

presentation to the degree. Consequentlj', teaching here appears to be producing

an income which may support a researcher                                                                                                                                                                                                      in reality, it is  the  acquisition  of  the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

university degree, and not necessarily the teaching, for which the pupil pays his

fee. Where the teacher is unprotected by any compulsory regulations (such as that

which requires attendance on his lectures and fee-payment on the part of the pupils)

it is impossible for him to obtain such an income by teaching for one hour a day as
will enable him to devote the rest of the day to unremunerative study and investi-

gation, for the following reason. Other teachers, equally satisfactory as teachers,

will enter into competition with him, without hai'ing the same intention of teaching

for one hour only, and of carrying on researches for the rest of the day. They will

contemplate teaching for six hours a day, and they will accordingly ofler to those

who require to be taught either six hours' teaching for the same fee which the

researcher charges fjr one, or one hour for a sixth part of that fee. Consequently

--the unprotected researcher will find his lecture-room deserted pupils will natu-

rally go to the equally good teacher who gives more teaching for the same fee, or
the same teaching for a less cost. And no one can say that this is not as it

should be. The university pupil requires a certain course of instruction, which he

ought to be able to buy at the cheapest rate. It does not seem to be doing justice

to the pupil to compel him to form one of a class consisting of some hundreds of

hearers, where he can obtain but little personal supervision or attention from the

teacher, whereas if he had the free disposal of his fee, he might obtain six times

the amount of attention from another teacher. This arrangement does not seem

to be justifiable, even for the purpose of providing the university professor with an

income and leisure to pursue scientific research. The student's fee should pay for

a given amount of teaching at the market value, and he has just cause of complaint

if, by compulsory enactments, he is taxed to provide the country with scientific

investigation.

Teaching must, in all fairness, ultimately be paid for as teaching, and scientific

research must be provided for out of other funds than those extracted from the

pockets of needy students, who have a reasonable right to demand, in retui'n for

their fees, a full modicum of instruction and direction in study.

In the German universities, the professor receives a stipend which provides

for him as an investigator. He also gives lectures, for which he charges a fee, but

no student is compelled to attend those lectures as a condition of obtaining his

degree. Accordingly, independent teachers can, and do, compete wdth the professor

in providing for the students' requirements in the matter of instruction. As a con-

sequence, the fees charged for teaching are exceedingly small, and the student can

feel assured that he is obtaining his money's worth for his money. He is not com-

pelled to pay any fee to any teacher as a condition of his promotion to the university

degree. In a German university, if the professor in a given subject is incompetent,

or the class overcrowded, the student can take his fee to a private teacher, and get
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.  521

 better teaching ; all that is required of the candidate, as a condition of his promo-
 tion to the Doctor's degree, is that he shall satisfy the examination-tests imposed
 by the faculty, and produce an original thesis.

       Unless there be some such compelling influence as that obtaining in the Scotch
 universities, enabling the would-be researcher to gather to him pupils and lees
 without fear of competition, it seems impossible that he should gain an income by
 teaching whiLst reserving to himself time and energy for the pursuit of scientific
 inquiry. It is thus seen that the necessity of endowment, in some form or another,
 to make provision for scientiiic research, is a reality, in spite of the suggestion that

 teaching affords a means whereby the researcher may readily provide for himself.
 The simple fact is that a teacher can only make a sufficient income by teaching, on

 the condition that he devotes his whole time and energy to that occupation.

   --Whilst I feel called upon to emphatically distinguish the two functions viz.,

--that of creating new knowledge, and that of distributing existing knowledge -and to

 maintain that it is only by arbitrary and undesirable arrangements, not likely to be
 tolerated, or, at any rate, extended, at the present day, that the latter can be made
 to serve as the support of the former, I must be careful to point out that I agree

most cordially with those who hold that it is an excellent thing for a man who

 is engaged in the one to give a certain amount of time to the other. It is a matter

 of experience that the best teachers of a subject are, ceteris paribus, those who are
actually engaged in the advancement of that subject, and who have shown such a
thorough understanding of that subject as is necessary for making new knowledge
in connection with it. It is also, in most cases, a good thing for the man engaged
in research to have a certain small amount of change of occupation, and to be called

 upon to take such a survey of the subject in connection with which his researches
 are made, as is involved in the delivery of a course of lectures and other details
of teaching. Though it is not a thing to be contemplated that the researcher
shall sell his instruction at a price sufficiently high to enable him to live by
teaching, yet it is a good thing to make teaching an additional and subsidiary part
 of his life's work. This end is effected in Germany by making it a duty of the
professor, already supported by a stipend, to give some five or six lectures a week
during the academical session, for which he is paid by the fees of his hearers. The
fees are low, but are sufficient to be an inducement ; and, inasmuch as the attendance
of the students is not compulsory, the professor is stimulated to produce good and

effective lectures at a reasonable charge, so as to attract pupils who would seek

instruction from some one else if the lectures were not good or the fees too high.

Indeed, in Germany this system works so much to the advantage of the students,

that the private teachers of the universities at one time obtained the creation of

a regulation forbidding the professors to reduce their fees below a certain mini-

mum, since, with so low a fee as some professors were charging, it was impossible
for a private teacher to compete ! This state of things may be compared, with
much advantage, with the condition of British universities. In these we hear, from

one direction, complaints of the high fees charged and of the ineffective teaching
given by the professoriate ; and in other universities, where no adequate fees are
allowed to the professors as a stimidus to them to offer useful and efficient teaching,

we find that the teaching has passed entirely out of their hands into those of college
tutors and lecturers. The fact is that a satisfactory relation between teaching and
research is one which wiU not naturally and spontaneously arrange itself It can
hardly be said to exist in any British university or college, but the method has

been thought out and carried into practice in Germany. It consists in giving a com-
petent researcher a stipend and a laboratory for his research work, and then re-
quiring him to do a small amount of teaching, remunerated by fees proportionate

to his ability and the pains which he may take in his teaching. If you pay him a
fixed sum as a teacher, or artificially insure the attendance of his class, instead of

letting this part of his income vary simply and directly with the attractiveness of
his teaching, you will find as the result that (with rare exceptions) he will not give

effective and useftd teaching. He will naturally tend to do the minimum required
of him, in a perfunctory waj'. On the other hand, if you leave him without stipend

as a researcher, dependent on the fees of pupils for an income, he will give aU
--522 KEPOBT 1883.

Ms time and energies to teaching, he will cease to do any research, and become,

pro tanto, an inferior teacher.

    A third objection which is sometimes made to the proposition that scientific

research must be supported and paid for as such, is the following : It is believed

by many persons that a man who occupies his best energies in scientific research
can always, if he choose, make an income by writing popular books or newspaper

articles in his spare hours ; and, accordingly, it is gravely maintained that there is

no need to provide stipends and the means of carrying on their work for researchers.
To do so, according to this view, would be to encourage them in an exclusive reti-

cence, and to remove from them the inducement to address the public on the subject
of their researches, by which the public would lose valuable instruction.

    This view has been seriously urged, or I should not here notice it. Anyone
who is acquainted with the sale of scientitic books, and the profits which either
author or publisher makes by them, knows that the suggestion which I have

quoted is ludicrous. The writing of a good book is not a thing to be done in

leisure moments, and such as have been the result of original research have cost

their authors often years of labour apart from the mere writing. Mr. Darwin's

books, no doubt, have had a large sale ; but that is due to the fact, apart from the

exceptional genius of the man who wrote them, that they represent some thirty or

more years of hard work, during whicli he was silent. There is not a suflBciently

large public interested in the progress of science to enable a researcher to gain an

Aincome by writing books, however great his literary facility.  school-book or

class-book may now and then add more or less to the income of a scientific inves-

tigator ; but he who becomes the popular exponent of scientitic ideas, except in a
very moderate and limited degree, must abandon the work of creating new know-

ledge. The professional litterateur of science is as much removed by his occupation

from all opportunity of serious investigation as is the professional teacher who has

--to consume all his time in teaching. Any other profession such as the Bar,
--Medicine, or the Church is more likely to leave one of its followers time and

means for scientific research than is that of either the popular writer or the

successful teacher.

    We have, then, seen that there is no escape from the necessity of providing

stipends and laboratories for the purpose of creating new knowledge, as is done in

continental States, if we are agreed that more of this new knowledge is needed
and is among the products which a civilised community is bound to turn out, both
for its own benefit and for that of the community of States, which give to and take

from one another in such matters.

    There are some who would finally attack our contention by denying that new

knowledge is a good thing, and by refusing to recognise any obligation on the part

of England to contribute her share to that common stock of increasing knowledge
by which she necessarily profits. Among such persons are those who would pro-

hibit altogether the pursuit of experimental physiology in England, and yet would
not and do not hesitate to avail themselves of the services of medical men, whose

power of rendering those serA'ices depends on the fact that they have learnt the

results obtained by the experiments of physiologists in other countries or in i'ormer

times. In reference to this strange contempt and even hatred of science, which
undoubtedly has an existence among some persons of consideration, even at the

present day, I shall have a few words to say before concluding this address. I

have now to ask you to listen to what seems to me to be the demand which we

should make, as members of a British Association for the Advancement of Science,
in respect of adequate provision for the creation of new knowledge in the field of

biology in England.

    Taking England alone, as distinct from Scotland and Ireland, we require, in
order to be approximately on a level with Germany, forty new biological

institutes, distributed among the five branches of physiology, zoology, anatomy,

--pathology, and botany forty in addition to the fifteen which we may reckon

(taking one place with another) as already existing. The average cost of the

buildings required would be about 4,000/. ibr each, giving a total initial expendi-
ture of 160,000/. ; the average cost of stipends for the director, assistants, and
                         TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.                                                                               523

maintenance -sve may calculate at 1,500/. annually for each, or 60,000/. for the forty

--equal to a capital sum of 2,000,000/. These institutes should be distributed in
-- --groups of five eight groups in all throughout the country. One such group

would be placed in London (which is, at present, almost totally destitute of such

arrangements), one in Bristol, one in Birmingham, one in Nottingham, one in

--Leeds, one in Newcastle, one in Ipswich, one in Cardiff, one in Plymouth in fact

one in each of the great towns of the kingdom where there is at present, or where

there might be with advantage, a centre of professional education and higher study.

--The first and the most liberallj' arranged of these biological institutes embracing

--its five branches, each with its special laboratory and staff should be in London.

If we can have nothing else, surely we may demand, with some hope that our

request will eventually obtain compliance, the formation in London of a College of

Scientific Research similar to that of Paris (the College de France). It is one of

--the misfortunes and disgraces of London that alone amongst the capitals of
--Europe, with the exception of Constantinople it is destitute of any institution

corresponding to the universities and colleges of research which exist elsewhere.

     Either in connection with a properly organised teaching university or as an inde-

pendent institution, it seems to me a primary need of the day that the Government

should establish in London laboratories for scientific research. Two hundred and

fifty years ago Sir Thomas Gresham founded an institution for scientific research in

the City of London. The property which he left for this purpose is now estimated

to be worth three millions sterling. This property was deliberately appropriated

to other uses by the Corporation of the City of London and the Mercers' Company

about a hundred years since, with the consent of both Houses of Parliament. By

this outrageous act of spoliation these Corporations, who were the trustees of

Gresham, have incurred the curse which he quaintly inserted in his will in the

hope of restraining them from attempts to divert his property from the uses to

--which he destined it. ' Gresham's curse ' runs as follows : ' And that I do require

and charge tlie said Corporations and chief governors thereof, with circumspect

Diligence and without long Delay, to procure and see to be done and obtained, as

they  will  answer  the  same  before  Almighty God                                                             (for  if they or  any of them
                                                                                                             ;

be difficult, nor so chargeable, but that the overplus of my Rents and Profits of

the Premisses hereinbefore to them disposed, will soon recompense the same ; be-

cause to see good Purpose in the Commonwealth, no Prince nor Council in any Age,

will deny or defeat the same. And if conveniently by my Will or other Con-

venience, I might assure it, I would not leave it to be done after my death, then
the same shall revert to my heirs, whereas I do mean the same to the Common-

wealth, and then the Default thereof shall be to the Repeoach and Con-

demnation OP the said Coeporations afore God '). I confess that I find it diffi-
cult to see how the present representatives of the Corporations who perverted

Gresham's trust are to escape from justly deserving the curse pronounced against

those Corporations, unless they conscientiously take steps to restore Gresham's

money to its proper uses. Let us hope that Gresham's curse may be realised in no

more deadly form than that of an Act of Parliament repealing the former one

which sanctioned the perversion of Gresham's money. Such a seqiiel to the Report

of the Commission which has recently inquired into the proceedings of the Cor-

poration and Companies of the City of London is not unlikely.

Whilst we should, I think, especially press upon public attention the need for

an institute of scientific research in London, and indicate the source from which its

funds may be fitly derived, we must also urge the foundation of other institutes

in the provinces upon the scale already sketched, because it is only by the

--existence of numerous posts, and of a series of such posts some of greater and

some of less value, the latter more numerous than the former-- that anything like

a professional career for scientific workers can be constructed. It is especially

necessary to constitute what I have termed ' assistantships,' that is, jimior posts in
which younger men assist and are trained by more experienced men. Even in the

few institutions which do already exist additional provision of this kind is what

is wanted more than anything else, so that there may be a progressive career open

to the young student, and a sufficient field of trained investigators from whicli to

select in filling up the vacancies in more valuable positions.

I am well aware that it will he said that the scheme which I have proposed to

you is gigantic and almost alarming in respect of the amount of money which it

demands. One hundred and sixty thousand pounds a year for biology alone must

seem, not to my hearers, but to those who regard biology as an amusing speculation

--that is to say, who know little or nothi::g about it au extravagant suggestion.

--Unfortunately it is also true that such persons are very numerous in fact,

constitute  an  overwhelming      majority  of the            community                                                         but  they are becoming
                                                                                                                             ;

less numerous every day. The time will come, it seems possible, when there will

be more than one member of the Government who will understand and appreciate

the value of scientific research. There are already a few members of the House

of Commons who are fully alive to its significance and importance.

   We may have to wait for the expenditure of such a sum as I have named, and

possibly it may be derived ultimately from local rather than imperial sources,

though  I   do  not  see why  it  should  be             yet  I think it is a good                                                   thing to  realise
                                                      ;

now that this is what we ought to expend in order to be on a level with Germany.

This apparently extravagant and unheard of appropriation of public money is

actually made every year in Germany,

     I think it is well to put the matter before you in this definite manner, because I

have reason to believe that even those whom we might expect to be well-informed

in regard to such matters, are not so, and as a consequence there is not that keen

sense of the inferiority and inadequacy of English arrangements in these matters
which one would gladly see actuating the conduct of English statesmen. For

instance, only a few years ago, when speaking at Nottingham, the present Prime
Minister, who has taken an active part in rearranging our universities, and has, it
is well known, much interest in science and learning, stated that 27,000/., the capital
sum expended on the Nottingham College of Science, was a very important

contribution to the support of learning in this country, amounting, as he said he

was able to state, from the perusal of official documents, to as much as one-third
of what was spent in Germany during the past year upon her numerous

               _

universities, which were so often 'held up to England as an example of a well-

supported academical system. Now, I do not think that Mi-. Gladstone can have
ever had the opportunity of considering the actual facts with regard to German
universities, for he was in this instance misled by the official return of expenditure
on a single university, namely, that of Strasburg; the total annual expenditure on
the twenty-one German universities being, in reality, about 800,000/., by the
side of which a capital sum of 27,000/. looks very small indeed. I cannot but
believe that if the facts were known to public men, in reference to the expenditure

incurred by foreign States in support of scientific inquiry, they would bo willing to
do something in this country of a sufficient and statesmanlike character. As it is,

the concessions which have been made in this direction appear to me to be in some

instances not based upon a really comprehensive knowledge of the situation. Thus,

the tentative grant of 4,000/. a year from the Treasury to the Royal Society

of London appears to me not to be a well-devised experiment in the promotion

of scientific research by means of grants of money, because it is on too small a

scale to produce any definite effect, and because the money cannot be relied upon
from year to year as a permanent source of support to any serious undertakmg.

     The Royal Society most laboriously and conscientiously does its best to use this
money to the satisfaction of the country, but the task thus assigned to it is one
of almost insurmountable difficulty. In fact, no such miniature experiments are
needed. The experiment has been made on a large scale in Germany, and

satisfactory results have been obtained. The reasonable course to pursue is to
benefit by the experience, as to details and methods of administration, obtained in

the course of the last sixty years in Germany, and to apply that experience to our

own case.

     It is quite clear that ' the voluntary principle ' can do little towards the

adequate endowment of scientific research. Ancient endowments belonging to the
country must be appHed thereto, or else local or imperial taxes must be the source
                                     TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.                   525

--of the necessary support. Seeing that the results of research are distinctly of

imperial, and not of local value it would seem appropriate that a portion of the

imperial revenue should be devoted to their achievement. In fact, as I have before

mentioned, the principle of such an application of public money has lone been

admitted, and is in operation.

     Whilst voluntary donations on the part of private persons can do little to con-
stitute a fund which shall provide the requisite endowment for the scheme of

biological institutes which I have sketched (not to mention those required for

other branches of science), yet those who are interested in the progress of scientific
investigation may by individual effort do something, however little, towards placing

research in a more advantageous position in this country. Supposing it were

possible, as I am sanguine enough to believe that it is, to collect in the course of a
year or two from private sources a sum of 20,000/. for the maintenance of a

biological laboratory and staff, it would be necessary, in expending so limited a

sum, to aim at tLe provision of something which would be likely to produce the
largest and most obvious results in return for the outlay, and to benefit the largest
number of scientific observers in this department.

I believe that it is the general opinion among biologists that there could be no-

more generally useful institution thus set in operation than a biological laboratory

upon the sea-coast, which, besides its own permanent staff" of officers, would throw

open its resources to such naturalists as might from time to time be able to devote

themselves to researches within its precincts. There is no such laboratory on the

whole of the long line of British coast. At Naples there is Dr. Dohrn's celebrated

and invaluable laboratory, which is frequented by naturalists from all parts of the

world ; at Trieste the Austrian Government supports such a laboratory ; at Concar-
neau, Roscoft", and Villefranche, the French Government has such institutions ; at
Beaufort, in North Carolina, the Johns Hopkins University has its marine labora-

tory                        and  at  Newport, Professor  Alexander  Agassiz  has  arranged a very perfect
                         ;

institution also for the study of marine life. In spite of the great interest which

--English naturalists have always taken in the exploration of the sea and marine

organisms in spite of the fact that the success and even the existence of our

fisheries-industries to a large astent depends upon our gaining the knowledo^e

which a well-organised laboratory of marine biology would help us to gain, there
is actually no such institution in existence.

    This is not the occasion on which to explain precisely how and to what extent a

laboratory of marine zoology might be of national importance. I hope to see

that matter brought before the Section during the course of our meeting. But I

may point out now, that though it appears to me that the great need for

biological institutes, to which I have drawn your attention, can not be met by
private munificence, and must in the end be arranged for by the continued action

of the Government in carrying out a policy to which it has for many years been

--committed, and which has been approved by Conservatives and Liberals alike yet

such a special institution as a laboratory of marine biology, serving as a tem-
porary workshop to any and all of our numerous students of the important

problems connected with the life of marine plants and animals, might very well
be undertaken from private funds. Should it be possible, on the occasion of this
meeting of the British Association in Southport, to obtain some promise of assist-

ance towards the realisation of this project, I think we shall be able to cono-ratu-

late ourselves on having done something, though small perhaps in amount, towards
making better provision for biological research, and therefore something towards
the advancement of science.

    In conclusion, let me say that, in advocating to-day the claim of biological

science to a far greater measure of support than it receives at present from" the-

public funds, I have endeavoured to press that claim chiefly on the ground of the
obvious utility to the community of that kind of knowledge which is called

biology. I have endeavoured to meet the opposition of those who object to the
interiference of the State wherever it may be possible to attain the end in view
without such interference, but who profess themselves willing to see public money

expended in promoting objects which are of real importance to the country, and

·which cannot be trusted to the voluntary enterprise arising from the operation of
the laws of self-preservation and the struggle for wealth. There are, however, it
seems to me, further reasons for desiring a thorough and practical recognition by
the State of the value of scientific research. There are not wanting persons of

some cultivation who have perceived and fully realised the value of that knowledge

which is called science, and of its methods, and yet are anxious to restrain rather
than to aid the growth of that knowledge. They find in science something inimical

to their own interests, and accordingly either condemn it as dangerous and un-

--trustworthy, or encourage themselves to treat it with contempt by asserting that

' after all, science counts for very little ' a statement which is unhappily true in
one sense, though totally untrue when it is intended to signify that the progress of

science is not a matter which profoundly influences every factor in the well-being
of the community. Amongst such people there is a positive hatred of science,
which finds expression in their exclusion of it, even at this day, from the ordinary
curriculum of public school education, and in the baseless though oft-repeated
calumny that science is hostile to art, and is responsible for all that is harsh, ugly,
and repulsive in modern life. To such opponents of the advancement of science,

it is of little use to offer explanations and arguments. But we may, when we

reflect on their instinctive hostility and the misrepresentations of science and the
scientific spirit which it leads them to disseminate, console ourselves by bringing

to mind what science really is, and what truly is the nature of that calling in
which a man who makes new knowledge is engaged.

     They mock at the botanist as a pedant, and the zoologist as a monomaniac
they execrate the physiologist as a monster of cruelty, and brand the geologist as

a blasphemer ; chemistry is held responsible for the abomination of aniline dyes
and the pollution of rivers, and physics for the dirt and misery of great factory

towns. Bv these unbelievers science is declared responsible for individual eccen-
tricities of character, as well as for the sins of the commercial utilisers of new

knowledge. The pursuit of science is said to produce a dearth of imagination,

incapability of enjoying the beauty either of nature or of art, scorn of literary

culture, arrogance, irreverence, vanity, and the ambition of personal glorification.

     Such are the charges from time to time made by those who dislike science, and

for such reasons they would withhold, and persuade others to withhold, the fair
measure of support for scientific research which this country owes to the commu-

nity of civilised states. Not in reply to these misrepresentations, but by way of
contrast, I woidd here state what science seems to be to those who are on the
other side, and how, therefore, it seems to them wrong to delay in doing all that

the wealth and power of the State can do, to promote its progress.
     Science is not a name applicable to any one branch of knowledge, but includes

all knowledge which is of a certain order or scale of completeness. All knowledge

which is deep enough to touch the causes of things, is Science ; all inquiry into
the causes of things is scientific inquiry. It is not only, co-extensive with the area
of human knowledge, but no branch of it can advance far without reacting upon
other branches ; no department of Science can be neglected without sooner or later

causing a check to other departments. No man can truly say this branch of Science

is useful and shall be cultivated, whilst this is worthless and shall be let alone ; for all
are necessary, and one grows by the aid of another, and in turn furnishes methods
and results assisting in the progress of that from which it lately borrowed.

   We desire the increase and the support and the acceptance of Science, not only

because it has a certain material value and enables men to battle with the
forces of nature and to turn them to account, so as to increase both the intensity
and the extension of healthy human life: that is a good reason, and for some persons,
it may be, the only reason. But there is something to be said bej'ond this.

     The pursuit of scientific discovery, the making of new knowledge, gratifies an
appetite which, from whatever cause it may arise, is deeply seated in man's nature,
and indeed is the most distinctive of his properties. Man owes this intense desire
to know the nature of things, smothered though it often be by other cravings which

he shares with the brutes, to an inherited race-perception stronger than the reason-

ing faculty of the individual. When once aroused and in a measure gratified, this
                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

desire becomes a guiding passion The instinctive tendency to search out the

causes of things, gradually strengthening as generation after generation of men have

stumbled and struggled in ignorance, has at last become an active and widely-

extending force : it has given rise to a new faith.

  -- --To obey this instinct that is, to aid in the production of new knowledge is

the keenest and the purest pleasure of which man is capable, greater than that

derived from the exercise of his animal faculties, in proportion as man's mind is

something greater and further developed than the mind of brutes. It is in

itself an unmixed good, the one thing which commends itself as still ' worth
while' when aU other employments and delights prove themselves stale and

unprofitable.

Arrogant and foolish as those men have appeared who, in times of persecution

and in the midst of a contemptuous society, have, with an ardour proportioned to

the prevailing neglect, pursued some special line of scientific inquiry, it is never-

theless true that in itself, apart from special social conditions, Science must deve-

lop in a community which honours and desires it before all things, qualities and

characteristics which are the highest, the most human of human attributes.

These are, firstly, the fearless love and unflinching acceptance of truth; hopeful

patience that                                     true  humility which                                                         is content not to know what cannot be known,
                                               ;

yet labours and waits ; love of Nature, who is not less, but more, worshipped

by those who know her best ; love of the human brotherhood for whom and

with whom the growth of science is desired and effected.

    No one can trace the limits of Science, nor the possibilities of happiness both of
mind and body which it may bring in the future to mankind. Boundless thou"-h

the prospect is, yet the minutest contribution to the onward growth has its absolute

and unassailable value ; once made it can never be lost : its effect is for ever in

the history of man.

Arts perish, and the noblest works which artists give to the world. Art

(though the source of great and noble delights) cannot create nor perpetuate ; it

embodies only that which already exists in himian experience, whilst the results of
Aits highest flights are doomed to decay and sterility.
                                                                                                                                                        vain regret, a constant

efibrt to emulate or to imitate the past, is the fitting and laudable characteristic of

Art at the present day. There is, indeed, no truth in the popular partition of human

affairs between Science and Art as between two antagonistic or even comparable

interests; but the contrast which they present in points such as those just men-

--tioned is forcible. Science is essentially creative ; new knowledge the experience

and understanding of things which were previousli/ non-existent for man's intelligence,

is its constant achievement.                                                                                              And  these  creations  never  perish                                 the  new  is built

through age ; the oldest discovery is even fresher than the new, yielding in ever

increasing number new results, in which it is itself reproduced and perpetuated, as

the parent iu the child.

     This, then, is the faith which has taken shape in proportion as the innate desire

--of man for more knowledge has asserted itself namely, that there is no greater

good than the increase of Science ; that through it all other good will foUow.

Good as Science is in itself, the desire and search for it is even bettei", raising men

above vile things and worthless competitions to a fuller life and keener enjoyments.

Through it we believe that man will be saved from misery and degradation, not
merely acquiring new material powers, but learning to use and to guide his life with

understanding. Through Science he will be freed from the fetters of superstition
through faith in Science he will acquii-e a new and enduring delight in the exercise

of his capacities : he will gain a zest and interest in life such as the present phase

of culture fails to supply.

     In opposition to the view that the pursuit of Science can obtain a strong hold

upon human life, it may be argued, that on no reasonable groimd can it appear a
necessary or advantageous thing to the individual man to concern himself with the

growth and progi-ess of that which is merely likely to benefit the distant posterity

of the human race. Our reply is : Let those who contend for the reasonableness

of human motives develop, if they can, any theory of human conduct in which
                                      ----

Wereasonable self-interest shall be man's guide.  do not contend for any such theory.

By reasoning we may explain and trace the development of human nature, but we

cannot change it by any such process. It is demonstrably unreasonable for the
individual man, guided by self-interest, to share the dangers and privations of his

brother-man, and yet, in common with many lower animals, he has an inherited
quality which makes it a pleasure to him to do so; it is unreasonable for the

mother to protect her offspring, and yet it is the natural and inherited quality of

mothers to derive pleasure from doing so ; it is unreasonable for the half-starved

poor to aid their wholly starving brethren, and yet such compassion is natural and

pleasurable to those who show it, and is the constant rule of life. Unreasonable

though these things are from the point of view of individual self-interest, yet they
are done because to do them is pleasurable, to leave them undone a pain. The race
has, as it were, in these respects befooled the individual, and in the course of evo-

lution has planted in him, in its own interests, an irrational capacity for taiing

pleasure in doing that which no reasoning in regard to self-interest could justify.

As with these lower and more widely distributed instincts, shared by man with

some lower social animals, so is it with this higher and more peculiar instinct

the tendency to pursue new knowledge. AVhether reasonable or not, it has by the

laws of heredity and selection become part of us and exists: its operation is bene-

--ficial to the race: its gratification is a source of keen pleasure to the individual an

Woend in itself.  may safely count upon it as a factor in human nature ; it is in

our power to cultivate and develop it, or, on the other hand, to starve and distort

it for a while, though to do so is to waste time in opposing the irresistible.

As day by day the old-fashioned stimulus to the higher life loses the dread con-

trol which it once exercised over the thoughts ot men, the pursuit of wealth and
the indulgence in fruitless gratifications of sense become to an increasing number

the chief concerns of their mental life. Such occupations fail to satisfy the deep

desires of humanity ; they become wearisome and meaningless, so that we hear men
questioning whether life be worth living. When the dreams and aspirations of the

youthful world have lost their old significance and their strong power to raise

men's lives, it will be well for that community which has organised in time a following

of and a reverence for an ideal Good, which may serve to lift the national mind

above the level of sensuality and to ensure a belief in the hopefulness and worth of

life. The faith in Science can fill this place-- the progress of Science is an ideal

Good, sufficient to exert this gi-eat influence.

    It is for this reason more than any other, as it seems to those who hold this

faith, that the progress and diffusion of scientific research, its encouragement and
reverential nurture, should be a chief business of the community, whether collectively

or individually, at the present day.

to the Middle Eocene of America, which is very rich in perissodactyl types.
Among these the Lophiodontidee occupy a prominent position ; they are probably
the aiicestors of both rhinoceros and tapir, and 0;-<^ocyworfo?i may be characterised
as a lophiodont with rhinoceros-like molars. The authors proceed to review the

     Among the specimens of Pennatulida dredged by H.M.S. ' Triton' in the Faroe

Channel daring last autumn were two cases in wliich the asexual zooids present

features of special interest.

     In the first case, the variety of Pennatula phosphorea known as aculeata, certain
of the zooids along the ventral surface are much enlarged and assume the form of
conical spikes, which attain a length of nearly a quarter of an inch. The greater
part of the length of the spike is formed by a unilateral development of the calyx
containinof prolongations of the body cavity, the mouth of the zooid being situated

near the base of the spike.

     In the second case, a new species of Umbellula, certain of the zooids possess a
single well-developed tentacle, with a row of pinnules along each side. In possess-

ing pinnules, and thereby exactly agreeing with a tentacle of a polyp the zooids
of Umbellula gracilis are unique, and a very interesting question arises as to
whether this unitentacular condition is to be considered primitive or not. This

question was discussed at some length, the evidence we possess, which however is

avowedly very defective, being on the whole rather against its primitive nature.^

--taken those which demonstrate the polymorphism of the lowest forms of

animal and vegetable life to which the Schizomycetes are most nearly related,

and those which indicate the polymorphism of Diseases accounted ' specitic ' by the

pathologist. In the pre-Darwinian days in which every species of plant or

animal was regarded as a special creation, permanently transmitting its distinctive

peculiarities from parent to offspring, there were two schools of botanists and

zoologists : one laying the greatest stress on minute differences, and multiplying

species to an extravagant extent; while the other, looking rather to points of

agreement, to the gradational characters presented by the differences when the

comparison is made between a sufficiently large number of forms collected from a

wide area of distribution, and to the modifying influence of external conditions,

aimed to reduce the number of specific types by making a large allowance for

* range of variation.' Among the flowering plants of Britain, for example, nearly

by one
--1,700 species were enumerated  distinguished  botanist                                          while  another  re-
                                                                                               ;

duced the number below 1,200 chiefly by the suppression (on the foregoing

grounds) of the large number of species contained in the variable genera Rosa,

Rubus, and Salix. And whilst D'Orbigny, in his classification of Foraniinifera,

enormously multiplied Genera as well as Species, by selecting only the most

strongly differentiated types, later systematists, by tracing out the gradational

connections between these, have greatly reduced their number.

The Evolutionist who looks at species simply as races, which, hnviiuj come to he

differentiated from each other, transmit their respective differentiae by genetic

descent, is prepared to admit any amount of such gradation ; the supposed per-

manence of specific types being, iu his view, simply the result of persistence of the

same external conditions, and giving place to change of type whenever these condi-

tions undergo any essential modification. The well-informed botanist or zoologist,

then, no longer entertains the idea of fixity in natural species ; and specific

designations are now only used provisionally, as indicating races in which well-

marked differential characters have been found to be transmitted genetically so long

as our term of observation has lasted. To the amount of change in any race which

might take place under the influence of small variations in external conditions,

acting persistently through a long succession of generations, no scientific Naturalist

would now feel justified in assigning limits.

The author desires to lay special stress upon two orders of facts, which he

believes to be familiar to every experienced naturalist. It not nnfrequently

happens, in the first place, that two types of plants or animals present in one

locality very well marked differential characters, and transmit these with such

genetic continuity as apparently to justify the ranking them as distinct species

while yet, in some other locahty, they are found to be connected by such a grada-

tional series of intermediate forms that it is impossible to draw a definite line of

demarcation between them. And, secondly, range of variation, arising out of

the modifying influence of external conditions, shows itself more strongly in the

lower than in the higher forms of vegetable and animal life ; and in no gi'oup more

strongly than in the simplest Fungi (the 'moulds' and ' blights ') to which the

Schizomycetous 'disease-germs' are most nearly related. From the natural-history

point of view, therefore, we should expect that instead of always developing them-

selves in one particular mode, and giving rise, by their introduction into the human

body, to one fixed and constant type of morbid action, those different forms of

bacilli, bacteria, or micrococci, which we are now learning to regard as the germs

of the different species of zymotic disease recognised by the Pathologist, should be

capable of midergoing considerable modification according to the conditions under

which they are developed, especially when those conditions act persistently through

a succession of generations. And we should further expect that, as the diseases

which we now regard as specifically distinct have come to be so by a process of
evolution, so, notwithstanding the well-marked differentiae which they may usually

--present, they may in other localities or at other times graduate insensibly into each

other a mild disease-germ developing itself into a virulent one, or, conversely, a

very severe type of disease showing itself under an extremely mitigated form. Now

this is precisely what the culture-experiments of Pasteur and his followers have

proved to he the fact ; the potency of certain disease-germs which have heen made
the subject of special research heing now found to he capable of a regulation
almost as precise as the precipitating power of the solution of a chemical re-

 agent.

     Notwithstanding the tendency among modern Pathologists to regard the various
forms of Zymotic disease as specifically distinct, and to attribute to inexact observa-
tion every recorded fact which runs counter to their preconceptions, the Author
holds that the application of the natural-history method to the study of these

diseases fully justifies the belief, that the same germs, undergoing development under

different conditions, may manifest themselves under a great variety of forms ; and

maintains that a larger study of the history of medicine also justifies the belief that
while some of these forms (such as the Exanthemata) have acquired a considerable

fixity, breeding only in the human body, yet that this fixity does not necessarily
hold good over tlie whole world, or through all time ; and that there is a large
class, including Cholera and the various forms of Fever, originating in germs which
breed in the soil as well as in the human body, over which the nature of the breed-
ing-ground, with various atmospheric (possibly electrical) conditions, exerts a most

important modifying influence. And he holds that tins inclusive study, taking
account of all the facts which science can bring to bear on the inquiry^ is much

more likely to lead to accurate results, than the exclusive method followed by most

Pathologists.

      In regard to Cholera in particular, he regarded it as still an open question

whether this disease is as specifically distinct from all others as it is commonly
regarded. Though it has been customary to represent true cholera as having
always radiated from India (which country never seems entirely free from it), yet
the author distinctly recollects the occurrence at Clapham of what was recognised
by an old Indian practitioner as Asiatic cholera, some years before the first epidemic

visitation of 18^2. And the report recently made by Surgeon-General Himter on
the epidemic of cholera now prevailing in Egypt, attributes its origin to local condi-

tions, which have produced an increasingly severe type of choleraic diarrhoea, at

last developing true cholera. This entirely accords with the view that disease-
germs which might originally have only produced a mild form of choleraic disea.se,

may be so 'cultivated ' as to develope its most malignant type. The author illustrated

this by the example of Small-pox, which he regarded as having been greatly miti-
gated during the last century by the beneficial ' cultivation ' of its milder variety by
Inoculation ; while the germs of the same disease, developing themselves during

the siege of Paris in the blood of men already rendered unhealthy by unfavourable

conditions, produced a malignant form of the disease, which had never before

prevailed epidemically during the present century, but which has been during the.
last twelve years the principal source of its fatality.

                        By J. Duncan Matthews, F.E.8.JB.

     The paper described in detail a series of experiments made with the purpose of
testing how far wool plugs were to be relied on as filters of atmospheric air, and

consequently, as preventers of the putrefaction of sterilised fluids protected thereby
from contamination of germs in the air.

      Flasks containing various cultivating fluids (5 per cent. Liebig's extract beino-
generally employed) were filtered into and boiled in glass flasks of about 4 oz!

capacity, closed by one or more plugs of cotton wool, or salicylic wool, or wooi
which had been steeped for some time in 5 per cent, carbolic acid and water and
often had in addition a sheet of salicylic wool placed over the plug and tied down
beneath the lip of the flask. The flasks were previously washed out with nitric,
sulphuric, or carbolic acids, and then with water, and often were subjected there-

after to a temperature of 400° Fahr. Boiled for fifteen minutes, allowed to cool
and then placed in an incubator at a temperature of 100° Fahr., the contained

fluids--prepared in various laboratories, the air of which was known to be hio-hly

--charged with germs always putrefied in from eighteen to thirty hours, or, if left

at the ordinary temperature of the air, at various periods of from four days to

--three weeks, becoming opaque, muddy, and forming a scum generally of bacilli,

but often of bactej-imn termo. It was found, if the laboratory was cleaned out
and allowed to remain undisturbed for a week or two, that for some days fluids

prepared in this way were perfectly and permanently sterilised, but after the
accumulation and raising of dust by work carried on there, they invariably broke

down. Fluids prepared in flasks with necks finely di-awn out and hermetically
closed by fusing the glass during boiling invariably remained pure. This did not
seem necessarily to be due to want of air in the flask, for hay bacillus developed

under these conditions when a few hay stalks were inclosed in the flask before

boiling, the hay bacillus germs resisting the action of a boiling temperature for
some time if protected by the hay fibres. But if the tip of these hermetically closed
flasks was broken off", and the air allowed free entrance, though for so short a period
as three seconds, putrefaction resulted. But the fact that the putrefaction did not
arise from germs originally present in the cultivating fluids or in the flasks, or,
being present there, from their withstanding the action of a boiling temperature,
was more conclusively proved by preparing in flasks with necks about \ inch
diameter, bent downwards, so that, after boiling, the flame of a spirit lamp might
be placed under the mouth, and allowed to burn around and up the neck for
about 1 inch, while the flask cooled. In such cases (a small wool plug being after-
wards inserted in the mouth), or if the neck was bent up and down several times
and simply left open, the fluid invariably remained pure in the incubator for any
length of time. The wool was not likely to be at fault, for, besides its being car-
bolised, if the necks thus bent down were plugged in the ordinary way, the in-
rushing air not being calcined, the fluids in tliem also putrefied, though it was
probable that any germs present in the wool, and not killed by being steamed,
could not fall into the fluid.

     Professor TyndaU's plan of discontinuous boiling was employed, the fluids being
boiled three to nine times at intervals of twelve hours, but with no better result
than in the ordinary cases, putrefaction occurring about twenty hours after the last
boiling. If water is sprayed, or a little poured over the wool-plugged flask during
cooling, the strong indraught of air to fill the vacuum caused by the boiling draws
in the fluid especially quickly between the compressed plug and the sides of the
flask's neck. It was proved that germs in this fluid could enter with it, and, if so,
·why not germs in the air ?

     Of six flasks, however, prepared in a pure atmosphere and perfectly sterilised,
three only, on reboiling in a contaminated atmosphere, became foul.

     The author thinks his observations throw some doubt on the sufficiency of wool
plugs as filtering agents where a strong current of air is passing through them, as
to fill a vacuum in flasks, though they seem to be perfectly reliable in cases of
ordinary sliglit and slow changes of temperature, but he thinks further observations

necessary to finally settle the point.

                  1. On the occurrence of Chloropliyll in Animals.
                     By Dr. C. A. MacMunn, M.B., B.A., F.C.8.

     In determiuing the presence of chlorophyll in an animal observers have to rely
on certain microscopic, physiological, and spectroscopic proofs, which, as Professor
--

    TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.  533

Lanlrester has pointed' out, are in some cases attended with difficulty. In the
instances about to be brought forward the microscopic and physiological proofs are

incapable of being applied. The former has, it appears to the writer, too much
importance attached to it, as chlorophyll in plants may occur evenly diffused

throughout the cell, dissolved in the cell-contents.
     Change to a green colour on treatment with sulphuric acid, which has been

observed in cases of vegetables, is no proof of the presence of a chlorophyll-like
body, as the writer has seen this reaction take place in sea-anemones, in whose
bodies no chlorophyll was present.

     Without accepting Sorby's or Kraus's views, the name chlorophyll is here
applied to that colouiing matter, or mixture of colouring matters, which can be

obtained from a green leaf by means of alcohol or alcohol aud ether. And the

proof of the identity of animal and vegetable chlorophyll is based on the
coincidence of the bands of an alcohol, ether, or chloroform solution of animal and
vegetable chlorophyll respectively, as well as on the coincidence of their bands on
the addition of the same reagent.

     The presence of the colouring matter which the writer has named ' entero-
chlorophyll ' ^ in the appendages of the enteron of various invertebrates was then
referred to, and it was shown that it is probably synthetically built up, for the

following reasons :
      (1) It can be detected in the bile and alcohol-extract of the livers of snails

after they have fasted for nine months.
      (2) It is as abundant in the liver, or other appendage of the enteron, of an

animal feeding on flesh.
      {3) Its spectrum is constant in animals feeding on vegetables which give

diflerent spectra when examined in solution.

      (4) It is not accompanied by other vegetable products, such as starch or cellulose,
 as it ought to be if food-chlorophyll.

     (5) It is present in many cases in the form of chlorophyll as such, not in that

of decomposed chlorophyll.

     With regard to the possibility of symbiosis being the cause of the presence of
chlorophyll, it was shown that although hi some cases, e.(/., liver of Helix aspersa,
Limac Jlavus, Avion ater, bodies resembling unicellular algas are present, yet the

chlorophyll cannot be due to them, since alcohol fails to extract their colour.

Moreover, enterochlorophyll is abundantly present when no such bodies exist, e.g.

liver of Anodonta, Myt.ilus, Ostrcea, &c. Besides, starch ought to be present if
 imicellular algae existed in those situations, which is not the case, as no reaction
 can be developed with iodine even after prolonged maceration of sections of inver-
 tebrate livers (fresh frozen ) in alcohol and caustic potash. In addition to observa-

 tions on enterochlorophyll the writer further called attention to the fact that

chlorophyll may appeal- to be present in an animal when it is reaUy due to the

 chlorophyll of its food, e.g. in green larvae, for in the latter case on removing the
 intestinal contents the green colour and the band in red both disappear.

      But in cantharides the presence of chlorophyll can be demonstrated in variou.s
 extracts of the wing-cases, and here it must be a synthetic production of the

 animal.

      Pocklington first observed chlorophyll in cantharides in 1873, and the writer
 has further extended his observations. It can be shown that solutions of chloro-
 phyll obtained by digesting the above-mentioned and other parts of the bodies of
 these beetles in ether, alcohol, and chloroform give the same absorption bands as
 similar solutions of vegetable chloropliyU, and the bands are altered in the same
 manner as those of a similar solution of vegetable chlorophyll, on adding the same

 reagent, e.g. nitric acid. Here at all events we have an example of the occurrence

 of chlorophyll in an animal where it cannot be due directly to the food, and cer-
 tainly is not due to symbiosis.

      With regard to functions, chlorophyll cannot be of much use in respiration,

                     ' Quarterly Joxirnal of Microscopical Science, vol. xxii. p. 229.

--534 REPORT 1883.

since oxidising and reducing agents have no effect upon it ; nor is it likely that it

can be of any use in decomposing carbon dioxide in the absence of sunlight, buried

deeply in the body of an animal, as in the case of enterochlorophyll. Its forma-
tion under these circumstances might be doubted, if we did not know that in the

coniferse and in ferns chlorophyll is formed in the dark.

    On the siu-face of an animal it may be of use in absorbing the chemically
active rays of the spectrum, as Lommel maintains in the case of vegetable

chlorophyll ; and C. Timiriazeff (' Compt. rend.' xcvi., 375-376) shows that

Langley's measurements with the bolometer prove that the point of maximum

Bsolar energy corresponds with the principal chlorophyll band between and C. If,

however, Pringsheim's ' screen ' theory be correct, this view cannot be held. It may

be of use for protective purposes or in mimicry, although probably a pigment of less
complicated chemical constitution ruight answer equally well, except that the eyes

of some invertebrates may be more susceptible to rays of a certain wave-length
than ours are, as Sir .lohn Lubbock has shown to be the case in ants.

     Again chloropliyll in an animal may be merely the persistence of a colouring
matter which was useful in a remote ancestor, at a time, perhaps, when the

atmosphere contained more carbon dioxide than it does now. The fact that all

flowers were at one time green, may help to throw light on this point.
     Enterochlorophyll may be of use in fnrnishing the material for the construction

of chromogens or radicals for the formation of other colouring matters.
     Thus the colouring matter of ox and sheep-bile appears to have some of the

characters of chlorophyll, although the writer has shown that it is a haemoglobin

derivative.

     Then again the elementary composition of chlorophyll and bilirubin are almost
the same according to Gautier and Hoppe-Seyler ; and chlorophyll and reduced
hsematin exist side by side in the bile of pulmonate mollusks, and in that of the

crayfish.

    The occurrence of chlorophyll in an animal should not excite so much surprise

when we Imow that the same proteids, the same glucosides, carbohydrates, and

digestive ferments are found in both kingdoms of nature. Lutein too occurs in plants

and animals, and the writer has lately found tetronerythrin in an orange flower.

Those who maintain that chlorophyll does not exist in animals, evidently con-

found other  bodies with  it,  such  as  protoplasm                                               and there  is  no  doubt  that
                                                                                               ;

chlorophyll is present in animals, being synthetically built up by and in their

bodies.

2. On-tJie continuihj of the Protoplasm through the Walls of Vegetable cells.

                               By Walter Gardiner, B.A.

     Although the great probability of a means of communication existing hetween
vegetable cells had been repeatedly expressed by botanists, actual demonstrable
instances that such was the case were but few, being in fact limited to Sach's
discovery with regard to sieve-tubes, and to the results obtained by Tangl with

certain ripe endosperms.

     The author, after briefly reviewing what work had been done on the subject,
goes on to describe in detail his own experiments with Mimosa, Robinia, Dioncea,
and other sensitive plants, and with thickened endosperm cells in general. As the
results depend in a great measure upon the methods employed, he describes the
various reagents he was led to make use of, the modifications adopted, and the

results obtained.

     In all the organs of movement examined the freely pitted parenchymatous cells
were found to communicate with one another by means of delicate protoplasmic
tlireads which perforated the closing membrane of the pits.

     In order to investigate instances where the thickness of the pit membrane
would allow any threads passing across it to be easily seen, the endosperm cells of
some fifty species of palms, together with typical representatives of some thirteen
orders, were examined, in all of which it was ascertained that definite and well-

pronounced continuity existed.
                            ;

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.  535

     Finally the author remarks that the existence of a communication between
adjacent cells appears to be of very wide, if not of universal occurrence, and he
briefly touches upon the important bearino;s this discovery has upon the cells of
sensitive organs, and upon cell mechanism in general.

     3. On the relations of Protoplasm and Cell-rvall in tJie Vegetable cell.
                                        By F. O. Bower.

      After tracing the history of this subject, it was concluded that it has now been
 demonstrated with as much certainty as is possible, by the use of micro-chemical
 and staining reagents, that in certain cases, the number of which is now constantly

 being increased, there is a direct connection between the protoplasmic bodies on
 opposite sides of cell-walls, and that this connection is established by means of
  tine strings of protoplasm, which, in the cases observed, run nearly transversely
 through the walls. The question remains whether this is the 07ili/ mode of per-
 meation of the cell-wall bj' protoplasm.

       The author cannot accept it as proved as yet, that any further permeation of
 the cell-wall by protoplasm, either as a reticulum or otherwise, really exists, but
 he brought forward certain grounds for regarding such a permeation as possible or
 even probable, taking into account chiefly those phenomena observed in free cell-
 walls, in order thereby to avoid any confusion with connecting strings, such as
 those already proved to exist.

      1. The strings already observed vary greatly in thickness, from the well-marked
 to those not individually distinguishable. Thus we have evidence of the existence
 of strings, which would probably not have been recognised were it not for com-
 parison with other examples. Further, it has been shown by the author's paper
 on plasmol}"sis, that protoplasm may be drawn out into strings so fine as to defy
 definition, even by high powers of the microscope. Thus there can be no objection
 on the ground of the small size of the hypothetical strings or reticulum.

      2. Those cases in which perforation of cell-walls has been demonstrated, are
 those very cases in which a most efficient physiological connection is required

there is no reason why a less obvious permeation should be denied, where the

 requirements are less, but by no means absent.
      3. There is a priori probability of some form of permeation of cell-wall by

protoplasm, if Strasburger's account of the growth of cell-walls be correct.

   A4. strong argument in favour of such permeation is found in the existence of

important chemical changes in the substance of certain cell-walls at points at a con-

siderable distance from the main proto2)l<tsmic body, e.g. formation of cuticular sub-
stance, wax, &c., which differ fundamentally from cellulose, are insoluble in water,
and are apparently formed in the wall itself. The tendency of recent observations
is to show more and more clearly how close is tlie connection of protoplasm with

the important chemical changes in the plant ; thus it appears probable that the
protoplasm is present in some form or other in such cell-walls.

     Reasons were also given for thinking that the exposure to air is not an impor-
tant factor in the above changes.

     These -and other considerations show thatj though this permeation of the wall
cannot be accepted as proved as yet in any one case, still the subject deserves more

close attention than it has yet received, while it may be expected that the
application of new methods may produce definite results bearing on this very

important question.

                 4. On the Intercellular Connection of Protoplasts.
                  By Professor William Hillhouse, B.A., F.L.S.

     In this paper the author commences by giving a brief summary of a paper
published recently by him in the Botanisches Centralblatt, ' Einige Beobachtungen
iiber den intercellularen Zusammenhang von Protoplasten,' in which he had shown
that, after complete solution of the cell-wall by strong sulphuric acid, and staining
536 EEPOET--1883.

with ammonia-carmine, the separate protoplasts give evidence of various degrees
of inter-relation, the most important being (1) knob-ended protoplasmic prolonga-
tions, their knobs having been firmly adherent to the middle lamella at the base of
a pit (' closing membrane '), knob-ended threads from contiguous protoplasts being
very commonly attached to opposite sides of the same closing membrane, and the

membrane often showing cross-striation between the knobs; (2) very much less
common fine unbroken threads passing from one protoplast to another, and joining

them, therefore, together. These latter he had described and figured in the cortical
tissue of Ilea: aquifoUum and yEscuhis hippocastanum, the pulvinus of Prunus
Zaurocerasus, and the winter-bud pith of Acei- Pseudoplatanus, in which alone, out
of 22 plants investigated at difterent times and in difi'erent parts, he had found
them. The author believes that most such threads would be broken in the process
of preparation, but points out that rarity would be no barrier to their action, as a
single thread passing from a cell to each of its impinging neighbour cells could

produce a perfect unity of the vegetable oi'ganism.
      Discussing the general objection formulated in the English translation of the

fourth edition of Sachs' ' Lehrbuch der Botanik,' p 788, that turgidity, and
consequently the growth dependent on turgidity, would be impossible with cells
having open pores in their walls, inasmuch as the smallest hydrostatic pressure of
the cell sap would be equalised by filtration through the pore, the author points oiit
that were the pores only to communicate from cell to cell, and assuming that Sachs'
contention that filtration would readily take place through them is correct, the only
effect of such pores would be to equalise the turgidity of the inter-commimicating

cells, and, therefore, to equalise the growth resulting from that turgidity.

    As to the action of such pores if they communicate with the intercellular

spaces, or with the exterior, again assuming that free filtration through them is

--possible, the author answers: firstly, that such openings would not be expected to

communicate commonly with the exterior or with other than neighbouring cells, as
where they occur they have probably been in existence from the earliest phases of the
cell's life, and the formation of an intercellular space would probably close them,
and also that deep pits with closing membranes commonly do not occur in such
places. Secondly, bearing in mind the case of the filaments from Bipsaais sylvestris
to which Fr. Darwin has drawn attention, and the frequency of cilia projected
through cell walls in the Thallophyta, the author thinks it by no means proved that
such cells cannot become tuigescent ; and finally asks how the sieve-tubes would
withstand the pressures they have to bear if their sieve perforations would destroy

turgipotence. He points out that in all these cases the cell sap would still have to
pass through protoplasm completely filling the pore ; that when the protoplast is

in its normal position lining the cell wall, this core of protoplasm filling the pore
would offer great resistance to a bodily passage of the cell sap promoted only by
the differential pressures of the cells, while molecular passage would take place
 more easily in other parts of the cell ; and, on the other hand, in the plasmolysed
 cell, filtration through the cell wall would go on too readily to admit of the use of

 the still ' plugged ' pore.
      The author then passes on to discuss the possible physiological action of the

 connecting threads, suggesting that an irritant applied to one cell would cause its
 protoplast to contract, the threads to be stretched, communicating the stimulus to
 the surrounding cells, these onwards to the next outer zone, the contraction thus
 afi'ecting a gradually and rapidly widening area. The whole tissue would then

 contract by the outward filtration of the cell sap.

     He further suggests the possibility that the cells may be made forcibly to

 contract somewhat through the agency of those threads (' knob-ended ') which do
 not pass through the walls, but retain a hold on the middle lamella at the closing

 membrane. Knob-ended threads also could transmit impulses.

     Finally he brings forward the hypothesis that protoplasm may be endowed with

 spontaneous expanding powers, similar to its powers of contraction, powers which
 the known nature of protoplasmic movements renders not unhkely. These expand-
 ing powers might be exerted at some one point or in some one direction, and thus

 define the tendency of the cell to assume a particular form.
----

TEAHSACTTONS OF SECTION D.  537

     The author sums up his conclusions as follows :
     1. That protoplasmic threads connecting neighbouring protoplasts are present in
such -widely difl'erent and ditiused structures as sieve-tubes, cortical parenchyma,
leaf-pulvinus, pith of resting leaf-bud, and endosperm of seeds.
     2. That in the contraction of the protoplast in natural plasmolysis these threads

would normally remain unbroken.

    3. That they may serve to transmit impulses from one cell to another,
acting in this way somewhat like a nervous system.

     4. That besides the perforating threads, equally widely spread and much more

numerous, are threads which attach the protoplast to the cell wall, whether at the
base of pits or otherwise ; and that these threads are often opposite to each other.

     5. That the closing membrane separating two threads often shows difierentiation

which suggests permeability, if not ' sieve perforation.'
     6. That in contraction of the protoplast in natural plasmolysis these threads

also would be normally unbroken.
    7. That these threads may when in extension act upon the cell-wall and put it

in a state of slight positive tension.

     8. That the presence of minute perforations communicating from cavity to
cavity of living cells, would not, and if communicating with the intercellular spaces

need not, be a hindrance to the turgipotence of the cells.

                 6. On some Cell Contents. By Makshall Ward.

    The author has for some time past been engaged in researches among the

--fungi particularly those which attack living plants, and his attention was

necessarily directed to the cell-contents of the host plants : among others, the cells
of Coffea, Cinchona, Pavefta, and Canthium, and one or two cryptogams have
received special attention. The present paper refers particularly to one class of

--bodies found in the cells of the cultivated species of L'offea C. arahica, C.

liberica, &c.

     The structure and chemical character of the endosperm have been carefully
investigated, and the author gives details of the germination.

     Certain fatty bodies, mixed with proteids in the endosperm, are traced into the
embryo and seedhng, and their reactions and changes are noticed.

     In the leaves, cortex, and other soft parts of the mature plant, are found ' fat
bodies ' under circumstances which compel the author to conclude that they are
the results of constructive activity, and not products of destructive metabolism.
These ' fat bodies ' consist of varying mixtures of fats and other substances

--probably in part proteid and show considerable similarity to the fatty masses in

the endosperm.
     Details are given of their reactions and changes, and the author believes that

they represent temporary stores, to be worked up further in the construction of

higher bodies. Tbey may be, in fact, fusions of fatty matters in various stages

of transition, carbohydrates, and salts of sulphur, nitrogen, &c., derived from the
soil: if so, the author points out that it is not improbable that the earlier

constructive acts in the formation of proteids may be taking place here.

                           6. On the Nectar Oland of Eeseda.
                By Professor Alexander S. Wilson, M.A., B.Sc.

    The flowers of this genus, of which the garden mignonette is the best known
example, possess in addition to the ordinary floral organs an extra structure named

a disk. This disk, which is an expansion of the top of the flower-stalk, is hollow on
its upper surface, its shape resembling one-half of a bivalve shell. In this shell-
shaped cavity of the disk the honey is secreted, and above it is protected by the
three upper petals, the claws of which are flattened and closely overlap, forming a
lid which completely closes the nectar-holder. The honey of Eeseda is thus
contained within a closed box, the lid of which must be prized up before it can be
 538 EEPORT-- 1883.

 removed. According to Miiller the most frequent v-isitor to Reseda is the bee
 Prosopis, which has a flat trowel-shaped proboscis which it uses iu plastering its

 cell.

      The nectar gland of Reseda bears such an obvious correlation to this form
of proboscis as to favoiu- the conclusion that in Reseda we have a flower specialised
for crossfertilisation by short-lipped bees. The slender flliform proboscis of the
 honey-bee or butterfly is manifestly correlated to deep tubular flowers like Phlox
or Honeysuckle, but does not correspond to a nectary like that of Reseda. On the
 principle that an oyster is more easily opened with a trowel than with a needle, we
may regard the box-like nectary of Reseda as corresponding to the short flat
proboscis of Prosopis. This points to the probability of Reseda being a very
ancient type of flower, since the short-lipped bees belong to an earlier and more
generalised type of insect than the specialised honey-gatherers. The condition in
the flowers of Reseda is almost the reverse of what we find in the buttercup.
In the latter the honej' is contained iu a little hollow in the petal, and is roofed

--over by the scale. In Reseda the position of the flower is changed the scale is

hollow and holds the honey, while the petal forms the roof of the nectary.
     The scale of Ranunculus and the disk of Reseda are not homologous, and the

comparison is onh' in regard to function. From the examination of the flowers
of Reseda from this point of view, we are led to regard them as exhibiting a

higher degree of specialisation in relation to insects than has hitherto been sus-

pected. At the same time we see that in them the adaptation is not, as it is in the

majority of flowers, most apparent iu the calyx, corolla, or stamens, but in the
peculiar development of the disk.

          7. On the Closed Condition of the Seed-vessel in Angiosperms.
                    Bij Professor Alexander S. Wilson, M.A., B.Sc.

     Flowering plants may be divided into two classes, according as their seeds

are contained within a closed seed-vessel, or are exposed without any such
covering. The former, having their seeds included in a pod or pistil, are called
Angiosperms or cover-seeded ; and the latter, on account of their naked seeds,
Gymnosperms. The Angiosperms, which form by far the more important

division, embrace most of the common plants which make up the bulk of our

flora, and are universally regarded as the more highly organised of the two.
Corresponding to the lower degree of organisation, Gymnosperms (yew, cypress,
fir, &c.) appear earlier iu the geological strata, and are largely represented in a fossil
state. The pod of an Angiosperm, such as that of a wall-flower, is composed of
metamorphosed leaves termed carpels. In nearly every instance these leaves are

so united as to form a completely closed case enveloping the yoimg seeds. At

first sight it would seem as if the presence of such a covering were a disadvantage,
for before the young seeds or ovides can develop to maturity they require to be
fertilised. The process of fertilisation is eflected by the agency of pollen-dust
which is brought to the flower either by the wind, or by insects visiting the

flower in search of honey. Now in the case of Gymnosperms, where the seeds are

exposed uncovered, this pollen-dust if blown by the wind simply alights on the
surface of the seed and fertihses it directly. In plants with covered seeds, on the
other hand, the pollen cannot gain direct access to the ovules, but can only fall on
the surface of the envelope formed by the carpellary leaves. This covering has to
be penetrated before fertilisation of the seeds can be effected. For this purpose
several adaptations of tissues, modifications of structures, and changes in the
position of the ovules are rendered necessary, all of which might easily be dis-
pensed with were the seeds exposed as they are in Gymnosperms. It can hardly be
supposed that all this specialisation, whereby the process of fertilisation so simply
performed in Gymnosperms becomes complicated by being broken up into
numerous subsidiary processes, should be called into play unless some very impor-

tant end were to be attained by the presence of a completely closed pistil. What

then is the 7-dle of the pistil ? The young seeds are the most vital parts of the
vegetable organism. Composed of delicate cells, containing much nitrogen and

phosphorus, they may he said to constitute the chemical and physiological wealth

of the plant. On this account they must he carefully guarded from any external

influence that would degrade their chemical constitution or lead to a misappro-

Nowpriation of the nutritious matters they contain.  it is well known that the

leaves and stems of nearly all plants are subject to the attacks of parasitic fungi.

The spores of these parasites germinate on the leaves of the plant on which they

alight, and appropriate its juices to their own use, as, for example, in the case of

the fungus which occasions the potato disease. All kinds of moulds, putrefaction,

and fermentation are in like manner produced by the development of spores

falling from the atmosphere which have found a favourable soil for their growth.

Now a more suitable pabulum or nidus for the growth of mould-germs can

hardly be imagined than that which would be afforded by the immatm-e ovules,

seemg that in them is collected a large amoimt of easily assimilable matter

destined for the nutrition of the embryonic plant. There can be little doubt then

that the disadvantages which the pistil brings with it, and the higher organisation

thereby entailed, are more than compensated for by the security which it gives

against the entrance of fungus spores. The pea pod is in fact the counterpart of

the hermetically sealed or stoppered flasks iu which Tyndall and Pasteur performed

their well-known experiments on the preservation of organic fluids against putre-

factive changes. These observers found that it was possible to preserve beef-tea

or other organic infusion, for any length of time, provided no air was admitted to

the flask, or if care were taken to filter the air from all organic germs, by passing

it through cotton wool, &c. before allowing it to have access to the infusion. The

pistil of a flower then may be regarded as analogous to the flask in these

experiments. The loose cellular substance of the style, and the acid secretion on

the stigma, may in like manner serve to filter the air before it reaches the ovules

contained within the ovary. At any rate, the air mvist pass through the substance

of the carpels before it can reach the ovules. This view of the function of the

carpels is coiToborated by the fact observed in the case of Reseda, the carpels of

which open soon after fertilisation. After dry weather an accumulation of sand and

dust frequently takes place within the ovary of Reseda. When this fact is viewed in

connection with the experiments of Van Tieghem, which show how diflicult it is

to eflect the direct fertilisation of ovules with pollen, owing to the constant appear-

ance of microscopic fungi, a new light is thrown on a vast number of vegetable and

animal structures. The same principle operates, not only among phanerogams, but

even among the cryptogams ; nor could a principle of such general application

in the vegetable world have failed to play an important part in the animal

kingdom. It is remarkable then to find that within the cup of the commonest

wild flower we have the results of recent scientific research anticipated, the

benefits of the antiseptic system as completely secured as by modern surgery, and

a parallel between nature and art which agrees even to the minutest detail.

                 4. Oil two neiv Dredging Machines.

         By Professor Milnes Marshall, M.I)., D.Sc.

The machines in question, named respectively dredging harrow and dredging

plough, are examples of apparatus devised for the capture of special organisms and

not for general purposes.

The harrow was designed for capturing FunieuUna, a giant Pennatulid attain-

ing a length of five feet or more. The machine consists of a horizontal bar, four

feet long, supported at a height of  fifteen inches  above the grouud by runners                                                                                                                                         to
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

the bar are attached a number of cords, weighted at their distal ends and bearing a

number of triple fish-hooks without barbs. To obviate the danger of the machine

falling on the bottom wrong way up, the runners are made in the form of wheels,

so that it is immaterial which way up the machine reaches the bottom. The

instrument was tried at Oban, and proved very successful.

The plough was intended to dig up Virgula7-ia, which owing to its brittleness

and length of stalk is usually cut oft' level with the sea-bottom by the ordinary

dredge. It consists of four digging blades attached to a horizontal bar, which, like

that of the plough, is furnished with a wheel runner at each end. The machine,

like the plough, is made reversible, so that it is immaterial which side reaches

the ground first, and special provisions are made to prevent risk of damage from

contact with rocks on the sea-bottom.

The plough, which was designed for and used by the Birmingham Natural His-

tory Society, worked well, though no opportunity has yet occurred of testing it for

the capture of Virgulmia. It was followed by a large bag to collect the specimens

dug up.

5. On the Influence of Wave-Currents on the Marine Fauna of shalloiv seas.
                             By A. R. HcNT, M.A., F.G.S.

     After showing that the action of alternate wave-currents on the sea-bottom

down to a depth of some fifty fathoms could not be safely disregarded by natu-
ralists, owing to the great length of storm-waves, which occasionally attain to and

exceed the length of one hundred fathoms (COO feet), the author proceeded to dis-
cuss the action of wave-currents on the marine fauna of shallow seas, under the

following heads, viz. :

     (1) The intiuence of wave-currents on animals living on rocks between tide-
marks.

     (2) The influence of wave-currents on animals living in sand between tide-

marks.

     (3) The influence of wave-currents on animals living in, or on, sand or mud,
below low-water mark.

    As a general rule, those animals belonging to the first class referred to above

evade the attacks of waves by theu- powers of adherence to rocks, or by taking
refuge in crevices ; those of the second class do so by rapidly penetrating the shift-
ing sand in which they live ; those of the third class depend for safety on their

powers of burrowing and mooring themselves in the sand or mud (being assisted
therein by many special adaptations of form and structure), on their powers of

attaching themselves to fixed objects, and on their powers of overcoming the
wave-currents on the surface of the bottom by virtue of peculiar forms whereby a
slighter wave-cui-rent suffices to restore them to their normal positions than suffices

to overset them.

     Immediately after the foundation of the Ashton-under-Lyne Biological Society,
in October 1880, the members felt the need of a reliable record of the Fauna and
Flora of the neighbourhood. It was therefore resolved that the first and foremost
work should be to prepare a list of the Fauna and Flora of the district comprised
within a radius of ten miles from the meeting room (Mechanics' Institution), and

--the foUowino- gentlemen have acted as chairmen of the various sections into which

the work was divided, viz. :

These gentlemen have been very kindly assisted by the naturalists of the neigh-

bourhood, and also by other members of the Society, especially our indefatig-able

secretary, Mr. J. S. Rowse. The result, so far, is the very comprehensive catalogue

which I now have the honour to present for your consideration.

     The district embraces portions of four comities : Lancashire, Cheshire, Yorkshire,

...and Derbyshire.
                                                                                  ^

    The scenery is highly diversified, bemg generally flat or undulating on the west

and south-west, whilst the east and north-east is occupied by the high moorlands

of Lancashire, Yorkshire, and Derbyshire ; the greatest altitude attained being

1,980 feet, at Kinder Scout in Derbyshire.
    The geological structure is also varied, the principal area being covered by

various members of the Carboniferous series, including the upper and lower coal

measures, which  occupy  the  centre                                                                                                                               and                           north-west  portion                                     the  Millstone  Grits

which appear on the east, forming the high lands, whilst the Yoredale shales are
found occupying some of the valleys in the same district. Then in the west and

south-west we have several strips of Permian rocks, and a large area of New Red

Sandstone. There are also immense deposits of drift in various localities, and one

or two boo'-mosses of considerable extent.

alpine forms, e.g., Pogonatuni nlpinum, L., Briium polymorphum, Campylojnis

atromrens, De Not., and C. pai-adoxus, Wils. With respect to tlie latter species,
Dr. Braithwaite, in his new ' Moss Flora,' remarks upon the unusual luxuriance of

;Mr. Whitehead's specimens.
     Buxbaumia aphylla, Ilall, is very interesting as occurring at so low an altitude,

about 800 feet above sea-level. Bryum Warneum, Bland, B. caloinhylliim, R. Br.,
and B. turlinatiun, Hedw., occur at gravel-pits near Ashton, only hitherto known
near the coast, and in 1865 Professor Schimper made a special journey to see these

mosses in so unusual a locality.
     Atrichum crispum, James, occurs in abundance at Greenfield and Staley

Brushes. When reported from this locality it was only the second station known

in Britain; it has, however, since been frequently found, hut only male jfl'-'nts, the

nearest locality known for the female plants being New Jersey, N.A.
    Dicranodontium lonyirostrum, Webb and Mohr., was found here for the first

locality in England.

    Along with each species we have recorded the time of fruiting.

                                                                     Hepaticce.

     Of Hepatics 61 species have been determined, and these are also arranged
according to the ' Loudon Catalogue,' 1880.

     Mr. Holt of Manchester has been responsible for this department, and Mr.

W. H. Pearson has kindly verified all the critical species, besides rendering other

valuable service.

    Amongst the most interesting may be mentioned the following :

      54. Odontoschisma denudatum, Nas., rare in this part of the countrv.
     47. Lepidozia reptans, L., with an abundance of fruit, which is a very rare
occurrence.

     Lepidozia Pearsoni (Spr.), a species which has been described by Dr. Spruce
since the publication of the 'London Catalogue' (see 'Journal- of Bot.' 1881,

p. 34).
        57. Cephuloziajftuitans, Nes.

       88. Blepharostoma trichophyUimi, L.
     105. Diplophyllutn obtusifoliiun, Hook.
     149. Jungermannia minuta, Crantz.
are all recent additions to this district, and somewhat rare in the North of
England.

    Only three species of Characecs have been recorded, to which the new one must

be added, and thirteen species of freshwater Algje are given.
     The Fungi have not yet been attempted, except the Order Myxomycetes, which

however is of profound interest to the biologist. These have been carefully

investigated by Mr. Thomas Whitelegge, who determined eighteen species, which
have been arranged according to * The Myxomvcetes of Great Britain ' by M. C.

Cooke, 1877.

     The author gave statistics of the strength of heredity (as shown by the presence
and niimber of abnormal toes) in cats. The peculiarity had been traced for many
years through eight generations, and in most eases there was no probability of
interbreeding with males of the same stock. In some cases there has been a distinct
intensification in the offspring of the character which was only possessed by the
mother. Accurate statistics had been obtained from 1879-83.

ruled sui-face of a high order. It frequently happens that when one extremity of

a fibre is fixed, the other extremity moves in a circle, which itself experiences a
movement of translation. The moving point then describes a trochoid ; examples

in pronator teres and pectoralis major. Muscle fibre may describe curves of a

complex nature, although the muscles themselves form a simple surface, as in the

two muscles already cited.

9. On the Annelides of the Southport Sands. By Dr. Carrington.

These observations were made during a stay of full 18 months at Southport

about 20 years since.
     The shore at Southport is far from productive. The littoral zone extends

for nearly a mile to the low-water channel. The surface is composed of a fine
granulated sand, intermingled in some spots with mud, and in others forming
banks of shell fragments. In no case do we find any fragments of rock or stone

laro-e enough for sea-weeds or corallines to cling to, so that practically the

Comlline and Laminarian zones are wanting, or rather the animals and plants

characteristic of these zones are for the most part absent. After storms, indeed,

the beach is often covered with masses of sea-weed detached from the fishing

banks outside, and clinging to these many hydrozoa, sponges, and other marine

species may be foimd.

     But these are generally in such a battered and mutilated condition as to be

useless for preservation, nor can we justly claim these 'rejectamenta' of the tides
as natives of Southport. For example, two species of Pholas may occasionally be
found (rarely, I believe, P. Candida has been taken entire), but the nearest known
habitat for these species is Hilbro Island, at the mouth of the Dee. As an instance
of the selective powers of sea-currents, it may be mentioned that only right-hand
valves of P. Candida are met with at Soutliport, while at Formby left-hand valves

are most numerous.

After the retreat of the tides, the surface is studded with iimumerable orifices,

some small as the prick of a pin, others as large as the little finger. Leading to

these were often stellate serpentine or labyrinthine markings, or evident worm-casts.

Near low-water mark on the Birkdale shore, projecting tassels resembling the tag

ends of old rope are frequent. These are the terminal tubes of Terebella, and the

author on one occasion, by turning over the excavated sand left by a digger for bait,

collected about a dozen species of Annelides, some living Heart-Urchins, and a
ManSipunculus. One of these Prof. Macintosh identified with the
                                                                 mirabilis,

interesting species, long a puzzle to naturalists, the author afterwards found in

some ahundance, and was able to study at leisure. It is a slender white worm,

having a peculiar cordate leaf-like snout, from the hase of which arise two long

tentacles studded with rows of conical papillae. The mobile snout enables it to
burrow rapidly through the sand, and when at rest it assumes an erect position

below the surface, the long branchiae waving about in the water. It does not

build any tube. Altogether he collected about sixty species during his stay at

Southport.

As early as 1745, Bonnet proved that the Nais and other worms, after division

into various parts, after a time regained the power of feeding and reproducing new

segments. The slight adhesion between one part and another, and the readiness

with which species break up into fragments, is often a source of embarrassment to

the collector. Thus, however carefully handled, he was never able to obtain an

entire specimen of a very beautiful Polynoe (P. astennce) which occupied the

ambulacral grooves of Asterinas aurantiacn.

     The species of Nemertes, again, without apparent cause, undergo spontaneous
sloughing or deliquescence. Many other Annelids, when kept on short commons,

undergo a process of budding or fission. This phenomenon can be well studied in
Nais jwoboscidea, the new formation taking place in front of the terminal segment.

Sometimes as many as four or six indi^dduals are thus interposed between the head

and taU of the original worm. In Scyllis and other genera the budding has a

sexual import, the detached individuals forming, in fact, locomotive ovm-ia. The

production of egg-bearing somites is exhibited on a large scale in such entozoa as

the Tape-worms. Dr. Williams, in his Rejjort oyi Annelids (British Association,

1851), denies the whole of what Bonnet and others have recorded respecting the

reproduction of lost parts in Annelids, although he admits a process of gradual

slougliing from injury or starvation                                                                                                                                      but the  phenomena  have  been  noted too fre-
                                                                                                                                                                       ;

quently by independent students to leave any doubt respecting them. It would

be out of place to enter into any structural details. In all Annelides the division

--into segments (of which the common worm is a typical example) prevails only,

instead of the simple bead-like structure, new organs are superadded, so as to tit

the species for progression in the pursuit of prey (Errantia), or for swimming

(Phyllodoce), or burrowing in the sand.

In the sedentary species the anterior portion is still further modified by the

addition of tentaculse, so as to enable the individual to search for food or materials for

constructing its tube : or designed for the protection of delicate parts (such as the

branchiae) from the encroachments of enemies. Examples of this kind maybe

found in the cork-like stopper of Serpula, which effectually closes the mouth of the

Atube.  similar protection from enemies is seen in the crescentic coronal of I£er-

mella, and the golden combs of Pectinaria. Lastly, the contrivances for the aera-

tion of the red fluid we may call the blood, are remarkably varied and beautiful.

They advance from a simple ciliated process given off from each segment, through

every grade of complexity, to the shrub-like ramifications of Arenicola. The

colouring of the species is equally variable : white, flesh-tinted, ruby-red, sea-green,

violet : the surface often glowing with pearly or metallic iridescence. When we

remember that the Annelides, constituting the chief food of many fish, birds, and

Crustacea, are subject to the attacks of various enemies, and that their delicate

bodies are liable to constant mutilation from the drifting of the sands and the

action of the waves, we see the reason for the recuperative power they possess.

The author mentioned a remarkable instance of survival under difficulties ex-

hibited by a Terebella which was packed away among his books when he left
Southport. The specimen was a mature worm with a portion of the tube, left in

the bottle just as he collected it, with a little sea-water and sand. On opening the

box four months afterwards, the creature was stiU living, although reduced to a

mere stump. During the interval it had actually canned the tube, growing thinner

and more transparent from lack of material, three times roimd the bottle.

The higher order of Annelids, the Errantia, are represented only by those

species which can bury themselves in the sand. In the absence of the shelter

afforded by vegetation, by boulders or the holes and crevices on rocky shores, where

                 10. On Protoplasmic Gontinuity in the Floridece.
                               By Thomas Hick, B.A, B.Sg.

      In the hope of throwing some light upon the interesting and important
question of protoplasmic continuity in vegetable tissues, tlie author has made an
extensive series of observations on a large number of species, l^elonging to several

genera of Floride£e, with special reference to this question. He finds that in every

species hitherto examined, the histological structure is such that, except where
accidentally interrupted, there is an unbrokeu continuity of the protoplasmic sub-
stances of the plant from the base of the frond to the tips of the ultimate brauchlets.
In the normal condition the protoplasmic body of every cell is connected, by means
of one or more protoplasmic threads, with the protoplasmic bodies of contiguous

cells, however numerous these may be. These threads pass through apertures in

the cell walls, by which the contents of the respective cells are separated.
      In the simpler filamentous forms, such as Pefrocelis cruenta, GriffitJisia setacea,

 Callithamnion Jtothii, and the like, the mode in which continuity is effected is

comparatively simple. In these cases the contents of each cell are connected
longitudinally with the contents of the next higher or lower cell by a single, fine,
protoplasmic thread, lateral connections only appearing where the basal cell of a
branch is connected with a cell of the main axis.

     The stouter forms of Callithamnion, e.g. C. tetragonum and C. arhuacula, are
provided with a cortex composed of filaments which arise from the bases of the
lateral branches, and, growing downwards, become adherent to the axial cells. In
this cortex, as well as in the axis itself, protoplasmic continuity is a marked
feature, an important point being that in the larger and older cells the protoplasmic
connections are no longer fine threads, but comparatively stout cords.

      In genera where the thallus obtains a higher degree of complexity, the
arrangements for the maintenance of continuity are more elaborate. Professor E,
P. Wright has shown that in Poli/siphonia urceolata, P. Jibrata, and P. atro-
rubeseens, the protoplasmic bodies of the central siphon are longitudinally con-
nected, as are also those of the cortical siphons ; while the contents of each central
ceU are similarly connected by transverse radial threads with those of the sur-
rounding cortical cells. The author's observations go to prove that substantially
the same phenomena are met with through the whole genus, and are especially
striking and easy to make out in P. fastigiata.

     The genus Ceramiuon has a structure difiBring from that of Polysiphonia in

many respects, but agreeing with it in presenting a thallus consisting of a central
axial row of cells, usually clothed to a greater or less extent by a cortex. By

careful manipulation and the aid of sections, it is not difficult to demonstrate proto-
plasmic connections between the cells, similar to those already mentioned. Such
connections render the protoplasm of the axial cells continuous from one end to the
other, and bring these cells into direct communication with the cells of the cortex.
In this genus, however, the connection between contiguous cells is made by two or
more threads, and not by a single one, as in Polydjihonia, Callithamnion, &c. In
Cerainium rubrum, for instance, the cortical cells are often connected by four or

                                                         NN2

five protoplasmic threads, a feature which gives sections of this plant a most

characteristic appearance.

     The genus Ptilota, so much admired for the heauty of its forms, is no less

remarkable for the striking examples it ofiers of protoplasmic continuity. This
is especially true of P. elegans. Fundamentally monosiphonous, so to speak, tlie-
older parts of this species become densely corticated, though the ultimate divisions
of the frond are simple filaments composed of oblong or quadrate cells. The proto-
plasmic bodies of these cells are in uninterrupted continuity, and the basal cell of

each branchlet is connected with a cell of the branch from which it springs. From
these ultimate branchlets the continuity may be traced backwards without a break
to the main axis of the frond, along which it may be followed by the help of
sections. The cells of the cortex are likewise connected inter se, and with those of

the axis they enclose, so that here, too, the contents of the difterent cells are in
direct communication throughout the whole plant.

     Other genera, in which corresponding appearances are presented, are Worms-
Tiioldia, Delesseria, Plocamium, Cystoclonium (ITi/pnen), Gu/artina, and Chondrus.
Of these the author has examined numerous species, with the result that in
no single instance are the connecting threads of protoplasm running from cell to
cell absent. To describe the phenomena in detail would be to repeat what has'-
already been said. Chondms and Gignrtina may be referred to as differing liisto-

loo'icaily from the other genera, and, indeed, from one another; but they are at

one with them in the matter of protoplasmic continuity.
     Of all the genera examined one of the most interesting, from the point of view

of this paper is Laurencia. In L. pinnafiftda the size, shape, and arrangement of

the cells vary much in different parts of the tliallus, but in e^ery part the proto-
plasmic bodies present a most remarkable appearance. From the surface of each,
at various points, are given oft' radiating processes, which run along channels or

pits in the thickened wall, and finally meet and blend with similar processes from the-
adjoining cells. These processes are invariably so stout and distinct as to give to
the cell-contents the appearance of a Ehizopod with short thick psendopodia.

     Of fresh-water Floridere, the author lias examined Batrachospermum and
 Chantransia, both of which exhibit evidences of continuity.

      Comino- to the question of origin the author is of ojnnion that the connecting

protoplasmic threads under consideration, originate, as a rule, in the manner de-
scribed by Professor E. P. Wright for Polysiphoyiia tirceolata. As a matter of fact,
the process of cell-division in the Floridese here dealt with, and probably in all,
never becomes completed, so that the parts of a divided cell remain connected
together by one or more threads of protoplasmic material. Nor are these threads
merely temporary structures. On the contrary, save where accidentally broken,
they are permanent, being met with in the older parts of the plant as constantly
as in the younger. Again, these threads are not dead, but possess the vitality and
power of growth of ordinary protoplasm. This is proved by the facts that, as a
rule, they become stouter with age, and give rise to differentiated structures. For,
simultaneously with the thickening of the threads, a pecidiar structure is developed
by each at about its middle point. This usually presents itself in the shape of a
rino- or collar, as maybe readily seen in CaUithamnion, Poh/siphonia, Laurencia, and
other o-enera. In some cases an extremely thin diaphragm is developed within this
collar. The nature of this it is difficult to determine, but that it is not a cellulose
partition seems to be indicated in many ways. For instance, it colours with iodine
and aniline dyes in the same way as the protoplasm, while the cellulose walls are
altogether unaffected. Moreover, when by desiccation of the specimen the proto-
plasm shrinks from the cell wall, it does not shrink from the ring and diaphragm,
continuity being as perfect in dried material as in fresh. Lastly, when the con-

tinuity is'broken mechanically, the fracture may occur at any point of the thread,,

and not necessarily at the collar.

      This rare and hitherto extremelj' local meat-eating slug has recently been found

an various places in Monmouthshire and South "NVales. Having found a few

examples in my kitchen gardens at Shirenewton Hall, I made an extended search

with the following result :

  --Shireneicton Hall Kitchen Gardens (four and a half miles from Chepstow). 120

examples were collected in less than an hour ; six of these were eating worms and

one was devouring an Avion hortensis. In the gardens and fernery, nearly half a

jnile from the kitchen gardens, six more specimens were obtained.
      --Shirenewton Villm/e. Cottage gardens and a field added a few more examples.

      --Itton Court (three miles from Chepstow). Several specimens.

specimen.

   --Hardwick (half a mile from Chepstow). Abundant.
   --Chepstow (in several gardens and on the road to Portskewett). Plentiful.

   --Cardiff (in Dr. Vachell's garden). Common.

     Further search will no doubt add considerably to the localities of this
interesting but little known species.

      As an instance of their destruction to worms and other slugs, it may be stated

that twenty-five fully-grown specimens were put in a slug cage with twenty-five
worms and the same number of Lima.c ayresiis and Arion hortensU, and in twenty-

four hours they had eaten the whole of them.

The Chairman delivered the following Address :

Anthropology, on one of its numerous sides, marches with Geology ; and hence

it is, no doubt, that I, for many years a labourer very near this somewhat ill-defined

border, have been invited to assist my friends and neighbours in the work which

lies before them during the Association week. I have the more cheerfully accepted

the ijivitation from a vivid recollection that when on a few occasions I have come

uninvited into this Department, my reception has been so very cordial as to lead

me to ask myself whether the Reports which for many years (1864 to 1880) I laid

myannually before                                           geological brethren did not derive their chief interest from their

anthropological bearings and teachings.

mainly to South Devon.

     Probably nothing Avill better show the apparent apathy and scepticism with

which, up to 1858, all geological evidence of the Antiquity of Man was received

by British geologists generally, than the following statement of facts :
     About the beginning of the second quarter of the present century the late Eev.

J. MacEnery made Kent's Cavern, or Kent's Hole, near Torquay, famous by his
researches and discoveries there. He not only found flint implements beneath a
thick continuous sheet of stalagmite, but, after a most careful paiustakiug investi-

gation in the presence of witnesses, arrived at the conclusion that the flints ' were
deposited in their deep position before the creation of the stalagmite' (Ti-ans.
Devon. Assoc, iii. 330) ; and when it was suggested by the Rev. Ur. Buckland, to

whom he at once and without reservation commimicated all his discoveries, that

' the ancient Britons had scooped out ovens in the stalagmite, and that through

them the knives got admission to the "diluvium,"' he replied, 'I am bold to say

that in no instance have I discovered evidence of breaches or ovens in the floor, but

one continuous plate of stalagmite diffused uniformly over the loam' (Ibid. p. 334).

He added, ' It is painful to dissent from so high an authority, and more particu-
larly so from my concurrence generally in his views of the phenomena of these

caves, which three years' personal observation has in most everv instance enabled

me to verify ' {Ibkl. p. 338).

      It is, perhaps, not surprising that Dr. Buckland, one of the leading geologists of

his day, should be too tenacious of his opinion, and feel too secure in his position
to yield to the statements and arguments of his comparatively young friend

MacEnery, then scarcely known to the scientific world.
     That the position taken by Bucldand retarded the progress of truth, and was

calculated to check the ardour of I'esearch, is apparently certain, and much

to be regretted ; but it should be remembered that, at least, as early as 1810 he
taught that 'the two great points ... of the low antiquity of the human race,
and the universality of a recent deluge, are most satisfactorily confirmed by every-

thing that has j-et been brought to light by Geological investigations ' ( Vindicice
 Geologicce, p. 24) ; that early in 1822 he reiterated and emphasized these opinions
in his famous Kirkdale paper {Phil. Trans, for 1822, pp. 171-236), which the

p. xxxiii); that in 1823, having amplified and revised this paper, he published
it as an independent quarto volume under the attractive title of JReliquice Diluviance^
of which he issued a second edition in 1824 ; and that though his acquaintance with

Kent's Cavern was much less intimate than that of MacEnerj', he, nevertheless, was,,

of the two, the earlier worker there, and in fact had discovered a flint implement

--in it before MacEnery had ever seen that or any other cavern the first tool of the

kind found in any cavern, it is believed, which in all probability was met with

under circumstances not in conflict with his published opinion on the low antiquity

of man. I confess that uuder such circumstances, human nature being what it is,,
the line followed by Dr. Buckland seems to me to have been that which most men
would have pursued.

     It was, at any rate, the line to which he adhered as late, at least, as 1837 ; for in
his well-known Bridc/civater Treatise, published that year, after describing his visit

to the caverns near Liege, famous through the discoveries of Dr. Schmerling, he

said : ' The human bones found in these caverns are in a state of less decay than

those of the extinct species of beasts; they are accompanied by rude flint knives
and other instruments of flint and bone, and are probably derived from uncivilised

tribes that inhabited the caves. Some of the human bones may also te the remains

of individuals who, in more recent times, have been buried in such convenient re-
positories. M. Schmerling . . . expresses his opinion that these human bones are
coeval with those of the quadrupeds, of extinct species, found with them ; an
opinion from which the Author, after a careful examination of M. Schmerling's

collection, entirely dissents ' (oji. cit. i. 602).

    It may be doubted, however, whether his faith in these, his early, convictions

remained xmsliakeu to tlie end. I have frequently been told by one of his 'con-

temporary professors at Oxford, who knew him intimatelj', that Buckland shrank
from the task of preparing for the press new editions of his Eeliquim DiluviaiKs
and his Bridgeivater Treatise. ' The work/ he said, ' would be not editing, but-

re-writing.'

     Mr. AlacEnery intended to publish his ' Cavern Researches,' in one volume-
quarto, illustrated with thirty Plates. In what appears to have been his second
prospectus, unfortunately not dated, he said ' The limited circulation of works of

this nature, being by no means equal to the expenses attendant on the execution.

of so large a series' [of Plates], ' the author is obliged to depart from his original

plan, and to solicit the support of those who may feel an interest in the re.sult of his-

researches.'

There is reason to believe that at least twenty-one of the Plates were ready, and

that the rough copy of much of his  manuscript was written                                                                                                                 but that, the support

(See Trans. Devon. Assoc, iii. 198-201.)

     In 1840, Mr. R. A. C. Austen (now Godwin-Austen), F.Ct.S., read to the
Geological Society of London a paper on The Bone Caves of Devunshire, which with
some amplifications was incorporated in his Memoir On the Geology of the South-
East of Devonshire, ^xmtQdi ill th& Transactions of the Society in 1842 (2nd Ser.,.

vi. 433-489). Speaking of his own researches ui Kent's Cavern, he said: Human

remains and works of art, such as arrow-heads and knives of flint, occiu" in all parts

of the cave and throughout the entire thickness of the clay : and no distinctioa

founded on condition, distribution, or relative position, can be observed, whereby
the human can be separated from the other reliquias ' {Ibid. p. 444).

    He added : ' My own researches were constantly conducted in parts of the cave

which had never been disturbed, and in every instance the bones were procured:
from beneath a thick covering of stalagmite ; so fiir then, the bones and works of

man must have Ijeen introduced into the cave before the flooring of stalagmite had'

been formed' {Ibid. p. 446).

     Though these important and emphatic statements were so fortunate as to bo

committed to the safe keeping of print with but little delay, and under the most
favourable circumstances, they appear neither to have excited any interest, nor
indeed to have received much, if any, attention.

     In 1846, the Torquay Natural History Society appointed a Committee, con-

--sisting of Dr. Battersby, Mr. Vivian, and myself aU tolerably familiar with the

--statements of Mr. MacEnery and Mr. Austen to make a few diggings in Kent's.

Cavern for the purpose of obtaining specimens for their Museum. The work,

though more or less desultory and unsystematic, was by no means carelessly done,

and the Committee were unanimously and perfectly satisfied that the objects they,

met with had been deposited at the same time as the matrix in which they were-

inhumed. At the close of their investigation they drew up a Report, which was-

printed in the Torquay Directory for November 6, 1846. (See Trans. Devon. Assoc.

mX. 162.) Its substance, embodied         a paper by Mr. Vivian, was read to the

Geological Society of London, on May 12, 1847, as well as to the British Asso-

ciation in the succeeding June ; and the following Abstract was printed in the

--Report of the Association for that year (p. 73) :

    ' The important point that we have established is, that relics of human art are-

found beneath the unbroken floor of stalagmite. After taking every precaution, by

sweeping the surface, and examining most minutely whether there were any traces-

of the floor having been previously disturbed, we broke through the solid stalag-

mite in three diflerent parts of the cavern, and in each instance found flint knives.

... In the spot where the most highly finished specimen was found, the passage

was so low that it was extremely difficult, with quarrymen's tools and good work--

men, to break through the crust ; and the supposition that it had been previously-

disturbed is impossibly'

It will te borne in mind that the same paper was read the month before to the

Geological Society. The Council of that body, being apparently unprepared to

print in their Quartei'hj Joiurnal tlie statements it contained, contented themselves

--with the following notice, given here in its entirety {op. cit. iii. 353) :

  --" On Kestt's Cavern near Toeqttay, by Edward Vivian, Esq. In this paper

an account was given of some recent researches in that cavern by a committee of

the Torquay Natm-al History Society, during which the bones of various extinct

species of animals were found in several situations."

It will     be  observed that the    ' flint  kni^-es '  were  utterly ignored                                                            a  fact  ren-

dered the more significant by the following announcement on the wrapper of the

Journal : ' The Editor of the Quarterly Journal is directed to make it known to

the public that the authors alone are responsible for the facts and opinions con-

tained in their respective papers.'

Such, briefly, were the principal researches in Kents Cavern, at intervals from

1825 to 1847. Their reception was by no means encouraging : Mr. MacEnery,

after incurring very considerable expense, was under the necessity of abandoning

the intention of publishing his Cavern Researches; Mr. Austen's paper, though

printed unabridged, was given to an apathetic unbelieving world, and was appar-

ently without efiect ; and Mr. Vivians paper, virtually the Report by a Committee

of which he was a member, was cut down to four lines of a harmless unexciting

character.

For some years nothing occurred to break the quietude, which but for an

imexpected discovery on the southern shore of Torbay would probably have

remauied to this day.

    Early in 1858, the workmen engaged in a limestone quarry on Windmill Hill,
overhanging the fishing town of Brixham in South Devon, broke unexpectedly a
hole through what proved to be the roof of an unknown and unsuspected cavern.

I visited it very soon after the discovery, and secui-ed to myself the refusal of a

lease to include the right of exploration. As the story of this Cavern has been
told at some length elsewhere (see PJiil. Trans, clxiii. 471-572 ; or Tram. Devon.

Assoc, vi. 775-856), it will here suffice to say that at the instance of the late Dr.

H. Falconer, the eminent palaeontologist, the subject was taken up very cordially
by the Royal and Geological Societies of London, a Committee was appointed by
the latter bodj', the exploration was placed under the superintendence of Mr. (now
Professor) I'restwich and myself, and, being the only resident member of the

< 'ommittee, the actual superintendence fell of necessity to me.

     The following facts connected with this Cavern were no doubt influential in
leading to the decision to have it explored:

     1st. It was a \'irgin cave which had been hermetically sealed during an incal-

culably long period, the last previous event in its history being the introduction of
a Reindeer antler, found attached to the upper surface of the stalagmitic floor. It

was therefore free from the objection urged sometimes against Kent's Cavern, that,
having been known from time immemorial, and, up to 1825, always open to all
comers, it had, perhaps, been ransacked again and again.

     2nd. It was believed, and it proved, to be a comparatively very small cavern,
so that its complete exploration was not likely to require a large expenditure of
time or of money.

     It will be seen that the exploration was placed under circumstances much more
likely to command attention than any of those which had preceded it. It was to
be carried on under the auspices of the Royal and Geological Societies, by a Com-
mittee consisting of Mr. S. H. Beckle9,"Mr. G. Busk, Rev. R. Everest, Dr. H.
Falconer, Mr. Godwin-Austen, Sir C. Lyell, Professor Owen, Dr. J. Percy, Mr. J.

--I'restwich, Professor (now Sir A. C.) Ramsay, and myself all Fellows of the

Geological Society, and almost all of them of the Royal Society also.
     It was impossible not to feel, however, that the mode of exploration must be

such as would not merely satisfy those actually engaged in the work, but such as
would command for tlie residts which might be obtained the acceptance of the

scientific world generally. Hence I resolved to have nothing whatever to do with

^ trial pits ' here and there, or with shafts to he sunk in selected places ; but, first,
to examine and remove the stalagmitic floor ; then, the entu-e bed immediately
below (if not of inconvenient depth) horizontally throughout the entire length of
the cavern, or so far as practicable ; this accomplished, to proceed in like manner
with the next lower bed and so on until all the deposits had been removed.

                                                                                                                                        ;

     This method, uniformly followed, was preferable to any other, because it would
reveal the poneral stratigraphical order of the deposits, with tlie amount and direc-
tion of such ' dip ' as they might have, as well as any variations in the thickness of
the beds ; it would afford the only chance of securing all the fossils, and of thus
ascertaining, not only the difterent kinds of animals represented in the Cave, but
also the rati(33 which the numbers of individuals of the various species bore to one
anothei-, as well as all peculiar or noteworthj- collocations ; it would disclose the
extent, character, and general features of the Cavern itself; it was undoubtedly the
least expensive mode of exploration ; and it would render it almost impossible to
refer bones or indications of human existence to wrong beds, depths, or associations.

     The work was begun in July 1858, and closed at the end of twelve mouths,
when the Cavern had practically been completely emptied ; an official Ileport was
printed in the Philosophical Transactions for 1873, and all the specimens have been
handed over to the British Museum.

     The paper on the subject mentioned at the beginning of this Address was read
in September 1858, during the Meeting of the Association at Leeds, when I had
the pleasiu-e of stating that eight flint tools had already been found in various parts
of the Cavern, all of them inoscidating with bones of mammalia, at depths varying
from to 42 inches in the Cave-earth, on which lay a sheet of Stalagmite from 3
to 8 inches thick ; and having within it and on it relics of Lion, HjiBna, Bear,
Mammoth, Rhinoceros, and Reindeer.

      It soon became obvious that the geological apathy previously spoken of had
been rather apparent than real. In fact, geologists were found to have been not so

much disinclined to entertain the question of Human Antiquity, as to doubt the

trustworthiness of the evidence which had previously been ofl'ered to them on the
subject. It was felt, moreover, that the Brixham evidence made it worth while,
and indeed a duty, to re-examine that from Kent's Cavern, as well as that said to

have been met with in river deposits in the valley of the Somme and elsewhere.

      The first-fruits, I believe, of this awakening was a paper, by Mr. Prestwich,

read to the Royal Society, May 26, 1859, On the Occurrence of Flint Implements,

 associated icith the Remains of Animals of Extinct Species in Beds of a late Geological
Period, in France at Amiens and Abbeville, and in England at Hoxne. (Phil. Trans.
for 18G0, pp. 277-317.) This paper contains explicit evidence that Brixham
Cavern had had no small share in disposing its author to undertake the investiga-

tion, which added to his own gi-eat reputation, and rescued M. Boucher de Perthes

 from undeserved neglect. ' It was not,' says Mr. Prestwich, ' until I had myself
 witnessed the conditions under which these flint-implements had been found at
 Brixham, that I became fully impressed with the validity of the doubts thrown
 upon the previously prevailing opinions with respect to such remains in caves

 (op. cit. p. 280).
       Sir C. Lyell, too, in his Address to the Geological Section of the British

 Association, at Aberdeen, in September 1859, said, ' The facts recently brought
 to light dming the systematic investigation, as reported on by Dr. Falconer, of the
 Brixham Cave, must, I think, have prepared you to admit that scepticism in regard

 to the cave-evidence in favour of the antiquity of man had previously been pushed

 to an extreme' (Report Brit. Assoc. 1859, IVans. Sects, p. 93).

     It is probably unnecessary to quote further to show how very large a share the
 Exploration at Brixham had in impressing the scientific world generally with the

 value and importance of the geological evidence of Man's Antiquit3^ That im-

 pression, begun as we have seen in 1858, has not only lasted to the present day,

 but has probably not yet culminated. It has produced numerous volumes, crowds
 of papers, countless articles in Reviews and Magazines, in various countries ; and,
554 EEPOET-- 1883.

perhaps, in order to show how Tery popular the subject became almost immediately,

Manit is only necessary to state that Sir C. Lyell's great work on the Antiquity of

was published in Februaiy 1863, the second edition appeared in the tbllowing

--April, and the third followed in the succeeding November three editions of a^
Abulliy scientific work in less than ten months !
                                                   fourth edition was published in

May 1873.

    Few, it may be presumed, can now doubt that those who before 1858 believed
that our fathers had under-estimated Human Antiquity, and fought for their belief,

have at length obtained a victory. Nevertheless, everj' Anthropologist has doubt-

less, from time to time,
                                     ' Heard the distant and random gun

                                 That the foe was sullenly firing.'

The ' foe,' to speak metaphorically, seems to consist of very irregular forces,,

occasionally unfair but never dangerous, sometimes very amusing, and frequently

but badly armed or without miy real armour. The Spartan law which fined a

citizen heavily for going into battle unarmed was probably a very wise one.

For example, and dropping metaphor, a pamphlet published in 1877 contains

the following passage : ' A\'itli regard to all these supposed flint implements, and

spear and arrow heads, found in various places, it may be well to mention here the
frank confession of Dr. Carpenter. He has told us, from the Presidential Chair of

the Royal Academy, that " No logical proof can be adduced that the peculiar

shapes of these flints were given them by human hands." ' (See Is the Book

AWrong?    Question for Sceptics, by Hely H. A. Smith, p. 26.) The words

ascribed to Dr. Carpenter ai'e put within inverted commas and are the whole of

the quotation from him. I was a good deal mystified on first reading them, for

-- --while it seemed likely that the President spoken of was the well-known member

of this Association Dr. "W. B. Carpenter it was difficult to accoimt for his being

in the Presidential Chair of the Rojal Academy, and not easy to understand what

Athe Royal Academy had to do with flint implements.  little search, however,

showed that the Address which Dr. A\^. B. Carpenter delivered in ]872 from the

Presidential Chair of, not the Royal Academy, but the British Association, con-

tained the actual words quoted, followed immediately by others which the author

of the pamphlet fonnd it inconvenient to include iu his quotation. Dr. Carpenter,

speaking of ' Common Sense,' referred, by way of illustration, to the ' flint imple-
ments ' of the Abbeville and Amiens gravel-beds, and remarked : ' No logical proof
can be adduced that the peculiar shapes of these flints were given to them by Human

hands ; but does any unprejudiced person now doubt it ? ' {Hcjport Brit. Assoc.

1872, p. Ixxv). Dr. Carpenter, after some further remarks on the 'flint imple-
ments,' concluded his paragraph respecting them with the following words:

' Thus what was in the first instance a matter of discussion, has now become one of

those "self-evident" propositions which claim the unhesitating assent of all whose

opinion on the subject is entitled to the least weight.'

  --It cannot be doubted that, taken in its entirety that is to say, taken as every
--lover of truth and fairness should and would take it Dr. (Carpenter's paragraph

would produce on the mind of the reader a very difterent eflect to that likely, and

uo doubt intended, to be produced by the mutilated version of it given in the

pamphlet.

   A second edition of the pamphlet has been given to the world. Dr. Carpenter

is still in the Presidential Chair of the Royal Academy, and the quotation from his

Address is as conveniently short as before.

     It would be easy to bring together a large number of similar modes of ' defend-

-- --ing the cause of truth' to use the words of the pamphlet just noticed but space

and time forbid.
     I cannot, however, forego the pleasure of introducing the following recent and

probably novel explanation of cavern phenomena. In 1882 my attention was

directed to two articles, by one and the same writer, on Bone-Cave Bhenomena.

The writer's theme was professedly the Victoria Cave, near Settle, liorlishire^
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEFT. ANTHEOPOLOGT.  555'

wliicli he says was an old Roman lead mine, but his remarks are intended to apply
to Bone-Caves in general. He takes a very early opportunity in the second article

of stating that ' VVe shall have to take care to distinguish between what is truly-
indicated in the " Science " view, from what are purely imaginary exaggerations of
its natural and historical phenomena ; and he no doubt believes that he has taken

                                                                                                                                                                                                             '

this care.

    We' have now,' he says, ' to present our own view of the "Mctoria Cave and

the phenomeua connected with it, premising that a great many of the old mines in

Eui'ope were opened by Phrenician colonists and metal-workers, a thousand years
before the Romans had set foot in Britain, wliich accounts for the various Roors

of stalagmite found in most caves, and also for the variety of groups of bones em-
bedded in them. The animals represented by them when living were not running-

wild about the hills devouring each other, as science-men suppose, but the useful
 auxiliaries and trained drudges of the miueis in their work, fcjome of them, as the
bear, had simply been hunted and used for food, and others of a fierce character, as

the hysena, to frighten and to keep in awe the native Britons. The larger species
of mammalia, as the elephant, the rhinoceros and hippopotamus, and beasts foreign
to the country, the Romans no less than the Phoenicians, had every facility in,
bringing with them iu their ships of commerce from Carthage, or other of the
African ports. These, with the native horse, ox, and stag, which are always
found in larger numbers in the caves than the remains of foreign animals, all
worked peacefully together in the various operations of the mines. . . . The
hippopotamus, although amphibious, is a grand beast for heavy work, such as
mining, quarrying, or road-making, and his keeper would take care that he was
comfortably lodged iu a tank of water during the night. . . . The phenomena of
the Victoria Cave Lead Mine differs in no material respect from that of hundreds
of others, whether of lead, copper, silver, or iron, worked in Roman and pre-
Roman times in all parts of Europe. Its tunnels have all been regularly quarried
and mined, not bi/ ancient seas, but by the hands of historic man. JDouble openings
have been made in every case for convenient ingress and egress, during the process
of excavation. Its roadways had been levelled, and holes made up with breccia,
gravel, sand, and bones of beasts that had succumbed to toil, on which sledges,
trolleys, and waggons could glide or run. . . . Near the entrance inside Victoria
Cave were found the usual beds of charcoal and the hearths for refining the metal,
while close by on the liDl-side may still be seen the old kilns in which the men
" roasted " the metallic ores and bm-ned lime.'

     Should anyone be disposed to ascribe these articles to some master of the art
of joking, it need only be replied that they appeared in a religious journal {The
Champion of the Faith against Current hifidelify, for April 20, and JMay 11, 1882,
vol. i. pp. 5 and 26), with the writer's name appended ; and that I have reason to
believe they were written seriously and in earnest.

     It has been already intimated that Brixham Cavern has secured a somewhat
prominent place in literature ; and it can scarcely be needful to add that some
of the printed statements respecting it are not quite correct. The following
instances of inaccm-acy may be taken as samples.

     The late Professor Ansted, describing Brixham Cavern, in 1861, said : " In the-
middle of the cavern, under stalagmite itself, and actually entangled with an
antler of a reindeer and the bones of the great cavern bear, were found rude
sculptured flints, such as are known to have been used by savages in most parts

of the world.' {Geological Gossiiy, p. 209.)

     To be 'entangled' with one another, the antler, the bones of the Cave-bear,
and the flints must have been all lying together. As a matter of fact, however,
the antler was on the upper surface of tlie sheet of stalagmite, while all the relics
of the Cave-bear, and all the flints were in detrital beds below that sheet. Again,
the flints nearest the bear's bones in question were two in number ; they were
twelve feet south of the bones, and fifteen inches less deep in the bed. There was
no approach to entanglement.

      Should it be suggested that it is scarcely necessary to correct errors on<

scientific questions in -works, like Geological Gossip, profe.ssedly popular aiid
intended for the million, I should venture to express the opinion that the strictest
accuracy is specially required in such books, as the great majority of their readers

^re entirely at the mercy of the compilers. Those who read scientific books of a
higher cla-ss are much more capable of taking care of themselves.

     Professor Ansted's slip found its way into a scientific journal, where it was made

the basis of a speculation. (See Geologist, 1861, p. 240.

     The most recent noteworthy inaccuracies connected with this famous Cavern

are, so far as I am aware, two in the English edition of Professor N. Joly's Man

Before Metals (1883).

An' According to the first, '  entire left hind leg of Ursm speltsus was found

lying above the incrustation of stalagmite which covered the bones of other extinct

species and the carved flints ' (p. 52).
     It is only necessary in reply to this to repeat what has been already stated

All the bones of Cave-bear found in the Cavern were in beds beloic the stalagmite.

The following quotation from the same work contains the second inaccuracy,
Weor, more correctly, group of inaccuracies, mentioned above : '
                                                                  may mention

among others the cave at Brixham, where, associated with fragments of rude

nottery and bones of extinct species, heaps of oyster shells and other saltwater

molluscs occur, as well as fish-bones of the genus scarm ' (p. lO-i).

    I am afraid there is no way of dealing with tliis paragraph except that of meet-

ing all its statements with unqualified denials. In short, Brixham Windmill-Hill

Cavern contained no pottery of any kind whatever, not a single oyster shell, nor
'even a solitary bone of any species of fish. One common limpet shell was the

only relic of a marine organism met with in the Cavern.

     As already intimated, the result of the researches at Brixham quickened a

desire to re-examine the Kent's Cavern evidence, and this received a considerable

stimulus from the publication of Sir C. Lyell's Anfiquitg of Man in 1863.

Having in the meantime made a careful survey of the Cavern, and ascertained

that there was a very large area in which the deposits were certainly intact, to
 say nothing of unsuspected branches which in all probability would be discovered

 during a thorough and systematic exploration, I had arrived at the conclusion

that, taking the Cavern at its known dimensions merely, the cost of an investiga-

tion as complete as that at Brixham would not be less than 1,000^.
     Early in 1804, I suggested to Sir C. Lyell that an application should be made

\to the Britisli Association, during the meeting to be held at Bath that year, for
the appointment of a Committee, with a grant of money, to make an exploration

of Kent's Cavern ; and it was decided that 1 sliould take the necessary steps in the
 matter. The proposal being cordially received by the Committee of the Geological
 Section, and well supported in the Committee of Recommendations, a Committee
consisting of Sir C. Lyell, Mr. J. Evans, Mr. (now Sir) .1. Lubbock, Professor .1.

--Phillips, Mr. E. Vivian, and myself (Hon. Secretary and Reporter) was appointed,

ftnd 100/. placed at their disposal. Mr. (\. Busk was added to the Committee

in 1860, Mr. W. Bovd Dawkins in 1868. Mr. W. Avshford Sanford in 186'J, and

 Mr. J. E. Lee in 1873. The late Sir L. Palk (afterwards Lord Haldou), the
 proprietor, placed the Cavern entirely under the control of the Committee during
 the continuance of the work; the investigation was begun on March 28, 1865,
and continued without intermission to June 19, 1880, the Committee bemg
 annually reappointed with fi-esh grants of money, Avhich in the aggregate

 amounted to 1,900/. ; besides 63/. received from various private sources.
     The mode of exploration was essentially the same as that followed at Wind-

 mill-llill, Brixham, but as Kent's Cavern, instead of being a series of narrow
 galleries, contained a considerable number of capacious chambers, and as the aim

-of the explorers was to ascertain, not merely what objects the deposits contained,
 but their exact position, their distribution! their condition, their collocation, and
 their relative abundance, the details had to be considerably more elaborate, while
-they remained so perfectly simple that the workmen had not tlie least difiiculty in

carrying them out under my daily superintendence. The process being fully

described iu the First Annual Report by the Committee (see Report Brit. Assoc,

1865, pp. 19, 20), it is unnecessary to repeat it here,

Mr. Godwin-Austen, while agreemg with Mr. MacEnery that flint implements

occurred under the Stalagmite, contended that they were found throughout the-

entire thickness of the Cave-earth. MacEnery, on the other hand, was of opinion

that in most cases their situation was intermediate between the bottom of the

Stalagmite  and  the  upper surface  of  the Cave-earth                                                                      and, while admitting          that
                                                                                                                ;

occasionalh', though rarely, they had been met with somewhat lower, he stated

that the greatest depth to which he had been able to trace them was not more

than a few inches below the surface of the Cave-earth. (Trans. Devon. Assoc, iii.

326-327). The Committee soon found themselves in a position to confirm Mr.

mGodwin-Austen's statement, and to say with Ii that ' no distinction founded on

condition, di-stribution, or relative position can be observed whereby the human

can be separated from the other reliquiiB' (Trans. Geol. Soc. 2nd Ser. vi. 444).

Mr. MacEnery's ' Plate F' contains seven figures of three remarkable canine

teeth, and the following statement respecting them : ' Teefh of Uisus Cultridcns.

Found in the cave of Kenfs Hole, near Torquay, Devon : hy llevd. Mr. McEnery,

January 1826, in diluvial Mud mi.v'd with Teeth and ynaw'd Bones of Bhinocervs,

Elephant, Horse, Ox, Elh, and Deer with Teeth and Bones of Jlycenas, Bears,.

IVolves, Foxes, ^-c.

It is worthy of note that no other plate iu the entire series names the date on

which the specimens were found, or the mammals with whose remains they were

commingled. This arose probably from the fact, well known to MacEnery, that

no such specimens had been found elsewhere in Britain ; and possibly also to

emphasize the statements in his text, should any doubt be thrown on his discovery.

It is, no doubt, unnecessary to say here that the teeth belonged to a large

species of carnivore to which, in 1840, Professor Owen gave the name of

Machairodus latidens. MacEnery states that the teeth he found were five upper

canines and one incisor ; and the six Museums in which they are now lodged are

well known.

   A considerable amount of scepticism existed for many years in some minds as

to whether the relics just mentioned were really found in Kent's Cavern, it being

contended that from its zoological sffinities Machairodus latidens must have

belonged to an earlier fauna than that represented by the ordinary Cave mammals
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

and various hypotheses were invented to explain away the ditficulty, most of them,

at least, being more ingenious than ingenuous. Be this as it may, it was naturally

hoped that the re-exploration of the Cavern would set the question at rest for

ever ; and it was not without a feeling of disappointment that I had to write

seven successive annual Reports without being able to annormce the discovery of a

single relic of Machairodus. Indeed, the greater part of the Eighth Report was

written with no better prospect ; when, while engaged in washing a ' find ' met'

with on July 20, 1872, I found that it consisted of a well-marked incisor of

Machairodus latidens, with a left ramus of lower jaw of bear, in which was one

molar tooth. They were lying together in the first or uppermost foot-level of

Cave-earth, having ov'er it a continuous sheet of Granular Stalagmite 2-5 feet

thick. There was no longer any doubt of MacEnery's accuracy ; no doubt that
Machairodus latidens was a member of the Cave-earth fauna whatever the

zoological  affinities might  say to the contraiy                                                                            nor was there any doubt that  Man
                                                                                                                          ;

and Machairodus were contemporaries in Devonshire.

     I cannot pass from this case without directing attention to its bearing on

--negative evidence : Had the exploration ceased on July 28, 1872 the day before
--the discovery those who had always declined to believe that Machairodus had

ever been found in the Cavern would have been able to urge, as an additional and

apparently conclusive argument, that the consecutive, systematic, and careful daily

labours of 7 years and 4 months had failed to show that their scepticism was un-

--warranted. Nay, more, had the incisor been overlooked and, being but a small
                                                                --

--object, this might very easily have occurred thej^ might finally have said ' 15-25

years' labour ' ; for, so far as is known, no other relic of the species was met with
durino- the entire investigation. In all probability had either of these by no means
improbable hypotheses occurred, geologists and palseontologists generally would

-- --have joined the sceptics ; MacEnery's reputation would have been held in very

light esteem ; and to say the least his Researches regarded with suspicion.

     "When their exploration began, and for some time after, the Committee had no
reason to believe or to suspect that the Cavern contained anytliing older than the
Cave-earth ; but at the end of five months, facts, pointing apparently to earlier
deposits, began to present themselves ; and at intervals more or less protracted
additional phenomena, requiring apparently the same interpretation, were observed
and recorded ; but it was not until the end of three full years that a "vertical
section was cut showing, in undisturbed and clear succession, not only the Cave-
earth with the Granular Stalagmite lying on it, but, under and supporting the

--Cave-earth, another, thicker, and continuous sheet of Stalagmite appropriately

termed Crystalline, and below this again an older detrital accumulation, known as
the Breccia, made up of materials utterly unlike those of the Cave-earth.

     The Breccia was just as rich as the Cave-earth in osseous remains ; but the lists
of species represented by the two deposits were very different. It will be sufficient
to state here that, while remains of the Hyrena prevailed numerically very far above
those of any other mammal in the Cave-earth, and while his presence there was

--also attested by his teeth-marks on a vast number of bones, by lower jaws in-
--cluding those of his own kith and kin of which he had eaten off the lower borders

as well as the condyles, by long bones broken obUquely just as hytenas of the pre-
sent day break them, and by surprising quantities of his coprolites, there was not a
single indication of any kind of his presence in the Breccia, where the crowd of
bones and teeth belonged almost entirely to Bears.

    No trace of the existence of Man was foimd in the Breccia until March 1869,
that is about twelve months after the discovery of the deposit itself; when a flint

flake was met with in the third foot-level, and was beUeved to be not only a tool,
but to bear evidence of having been used as such (see Report Brit. Assoc. 1869,

pp. 201, 202). Two massive flint implements were discovered in the same deposit
in May 1872, and at various subsequent times other tools were found, until at the

close of the exploration the Breccia had yielded upwards of seventy implements of
flint and chert.

     WTiile all the stone tools of both the Cave-earth and the Breccia were Pala3o-
lithic and were found inosculating with remains of extinct mammals, a mere
inspection shows that they belong to two distinct categories. Those found in the

-- --Breccia that is the more ancient series were formed by chipping a flmt nodule
--or pebble into a tool, while those from the Cave-earth the less ancient series
-- --were fashioned by first detaching a suitable flake from the nodule or pebble, and

then trimming the flake not the nodule mto a tool.
     It must be unnecessary to say that the making of nodule-tools necessitated

the production of flakes and chips, some of which were no doubt utihsed. Such
flakes, however, must be regarded as accidents, and not the final objects the workers
had in view.

   mIt is worthy of remark that one part of the Cavern, upwards of 130 feet in

length, the excavation was carried to a depth of 9 feet, instead of the usual 4 feet,
below the bottom of the Stalagmite ; and that while no bone of any kind occurred
in the Breccia below the seventh foot-level, three fine flint nodule-tools were found
in the eighth, and several flint chips in the ninth, or lowest foot-level.

     It may be added that the same fact presented itself in the lowest or corre-
sponding bed in Brixham Windmill-Hill Cavern. In short, in each of the two
famous Devonshire Caverns the archceological zone reached a lower level than the

palseontological.

     That the Breccia is of higher antiquity than the Cave-earth is proved by the

unquestionable evidence of clear undisturbed superposition ; that they represent

two distinct chapters and eras in the Cavern history is shown by the decided dis-
similarity of the materials composing them, the marked diiference in the osseous

remains they contained, and the strongly contrasted characters of the stone imple-

ments they pelded ; and that they were separated by a wide interval of time may

be safely inferred from the thickness of the bed of stalagmite between them.
     It is probable, however, that the fact most significant of time and physical change

is the presence of the Ilysena in the Cave-earth or less ancient, but not in the

Breccia or more ancient of the two deposits. I called attention to this fact in a paper
read to this Department ten years ago (see Rejiort Brit. Assoc. 1873, pp. 209-214),
and at greater length elsewhere in 1875 (see Trans. Plyin. Inst. v. 360-375).
Bearing in mind the Oave-haunting habits of the Hysena, the great preponderance
of his remains in the Cave-earth, and their absence in the Breccia, it seems impos-
sible to avoid the conclusion that he was not an occupant of Britain during the

earlier period.

     The acceptance of this conclusion, however, necessitates the belief, 1st. That

Man was resident in Britain long before the Hyjena was.

     2nd. That it was possible for the Hysena to reach Britain between the deposition

of the Breccia and the deposition of the Cave-earth. In other words, that Britain

was a part of the Continent during this interval.
     Sir 0. Lyell, it will be remembered, recognised the following geographical

changes within the British area between Newer Pliocene and Historical times.
(See Antiquity of Man, ed. 1873, pp. 331, 332.)

     Firstly, a pre-glacial continental period, towards the close of which the Forest of
Cromer flourished, and the climate was somewhat milder than at present.

     Secondly, a period of submergence, when the land north of the Thames and
Bristol Channel, and that of Ireland, was reduced to an archipelago. This was a

part of the Glacial Age, and icebergs floated in our waters.

    Thirdly, a second continental period, when there were glaciers in the higher

mountains of Scotland and Wales.

Fourthly, the breaking up of the land through submergence, and a gradual

change of temperature, resulting in the present geographical and climatal

conditions.

     It is obvious that if, as I venture to think, the Kent's Cavern Breccia was
deposited during the first continental period the list of mammalian remains found

in it should not clash with the list of such remains from the Forest of Cromer,

which, as we have just seen, flourished at that time. I called attention to these

lists in 1874, pointing out that according to Professor Boyd Dawkins {Cave-

Hunting, p. 418) the Forest-bed had at that time yielded 26 species of mammals,

16 of them being extinct, and 10 recent ; that both the Breccia and the Forest-bed

had yielded remains of the Cave-bear, but that in neither of them had any reHc or

Atrace of Hysena been found.  ilonograph on the Vertehrata of the Forest-bed

Series was published in 1882, by Mr. E. T. Newton, F.G.S., who, including many

additional species fomid somewhat recently, but eliminating all those about which

Wethere was any uncertainty, said : '  still have 49 species left, of which 30 are

still li'\'ing, and 19 are extinct' (p. 135). Though the number of the species has

thus been almost doubled, and the presence of the Cave-bear remains undoubted,

it continues to be the fact that no trace of the Hysena has been found in the Forest-

bed, and no suspicion exists as to his probable presence amongst the eliminated

uncertain species.

    It should be added that no relic or indication of Hy^na was met with in the

* Foiu^th Bed ' of Brixham Windmill-Hill Cavern, believed to be the equivalent of

the Kent's Hole Breccia.

    I am not immindful of the fact that my evidence is negative only, and that
raising a structure on it may be building on a sandy foundation. Nevertheless,

it appears to me, as it did ten years ago, strong enough to bear the following

inferences:

     1st. That the Hysena did not reach Britain until its last continental period.
--560 REPORT 1883.

     2nd. That the Men who made the Palaeolithic nodule-tools found in the oldest

--Imown deposit in Kent's (!avern, arrived during the previous great suhniergence, or,

what is more prohable indeed, what alone seems posBihle unless they were navi-

--gators- during the first continental period. In short, I have little or no doubt

that the earliest Devonians we have sighted were either of Glacial, or, more

probably, of Pre-glacial age.

      It cannot be necessary to add that while tlie discovery of remains of Ilysena in
the Forest-bed of Cromer, or any other contemporary deposit, would be utterly

fatal to my argument, it would leave intact all other evidence in support of the

doctrine of British Glacial or Pre-glacial Man.^

    Some of my friends accepted the foregoing inferences in 1873, while others,

whose judgment I value, declined them. Since that date no advei'se fact or

thought has presented itself to me ; but through the researches and discoveries of

others in comparatively distant parts of our island, and especiallj' in East Angliay

the belief in British Pre-glacial Man appears to ha^·e risen above the stage of

ridicule, and to have a decided prospect of general scientific acceptance at no

distant time.

I must, before closing, devote a few words to a class of workers who are 'more

plague than profit.'

The exuberant enthusiasm of some would-be pioneers in the question of Human

Antiquity results occasionally in supposed ' discoveries ' having an amusing side
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

and not unfrequently some of the pioneers, though utter strangers, are so good as

to send me descriptions of their ' finds,' and of their views respecting them. The

following case may be taken as a sample. In 18S1, a gentleman, of whom I had

never heard, wrote, stating that he was one of those who felt deeply interested in

the Antiquity of Man, and that he had read all the books he could command ou
the subject. He was aware that it had been said by one palaeontologist to be
'unreasonable to suppose that Man had lived during the Eocene and Mioceno

periods,' but he had an indistinct recollection that another eminent man had some-
where said that ' Man had probably existed in England during a tropical Carbon-

iferous flora and fauna.' He then went on to say, I' have got that which I

cannot but look upon as a fossil human skull. I have endeavoured to examine it

from every conceivable standpoint, and it seems to stand the test. The angles

seem perfect, the contour the same but smaller in size than the average human

head                           but that, in my opinion, is only what       should be expected if we assume     that
                            ;

Man lived during the Carboniferous period, in spite of what Herodotus saj-s about

the body of Orestes.' Finally, he requested to be allowed to send me the specimen.
On its arrival, it proved, of course, to be merely a .stone ; and nothing but a strong

' Unscientific Use of the Imagination ' could lead anyone to believe that it had ever

been a skull, human or infrahuman.

It may be added that a few years ago a gentleman brought me what he called,

and believed to be, ' three human skulls and as many elephants' teeth,' found from

time to time, during his researches in a limestone quarry. They proved to be

nothing more than six oddly shaped lumps of Devonian limestone.

So far as Britain is concerned. Cave-hunting is a science of Devonshire birth.

The limestone caverns of Oreston, near Plymouth, were examined with some care

in the interests of Palaeontology as early as 1816, and subsequently as they were

3. The Borness Cave, Kirhcudbrightshire. By A. R. Hunt, M.A., F.G.S.

After referring to the published reports of the exploration of the Borness Cave

(·vid. 'Proc. Soc. Ant. Scotland,' vols. X., XI., XII.), and acknowledging his in-

debtedness to his colleagues on the exploration committee for permission to refer to

the manuscript records of the cave work, the author proceeded to point out the

peculiar interest attaching to the Borness Cave, from its position on the sea-

coast, and from its having been resorted to as a place of refuge on more than one

occasion previous to the period known as Komano-Britisb. The three principal

-- Anoccupations of the cave were indicated by the following deposits, viz. : (1)
upper deposit of dark cave earth, between three and four feet thick, of Eomano-

ABritish age. (2) thin band of charcoal, bones, and shells at the jimction of the
Afourth and fifth foot levels. (3)
                                    layer of charcoal and other organic remains

sloping outwards from the interior at an incline of about 1 in 26. At the entrance

of the cave the lower band (3) was separated from the Romano-British cave eartli

(which at this point thins out) by a deposit consisting of stones and carbonate of

lime in different proportions, capped by pure stalagmite. Of this deposit, at the

point indicated, some live feet at least must have been formed before the Romano-

British occupation commenced. The era of the occupation indicated by the lower

band was separated from that indicated by the Romano-British cave earth by the

period represented by the intercalated mass of stalagmite and breccia. Without

attempting to define the rate of deposition of the carbonate of lime at Borness, the

author deprecated any assumption that it was necessarily rapid ; the absence of

limestone in the neighbourhood and the exposure of the stalagmite to the wash of

rains, presenting conditions unfavourable for its rapid formation. The fact that

the cave is on the sea-coast precludes the possibility that it was resorted to as

a refuge from the Saxons, who had command of the sea long before they took

possession of Galloway by land. The Romano-British occupation of the Borness

«ave may well have been earlier than that of the English caves that have pro-

duced implements similar to those from Borness, as the district in which the

latter is situated was less firmly held by the Romans than those parts of Great

Britain south of the wall of Hadrian. The author referred to the well-known

bone implements which have been variously described as links, portions of musical

instruments, and receptacles for hone pins. Owing to the fact that one specimen

from Borness was solid, and that another, a hollow one, contained bone pins, the

author felt unable to accept any of the current theories respecting these im-

plements. He suggested that these objects might have been advantageously used

as handles for imparting a rotatory motion to individual strands in the manu-

facture of leather ropes, the pegs fixed into a piece of wood being used to regulate

the twist of the rope. The author exhibited a small three-strand leather rope made

in the manner suggested.

4. On the Eelutive Length of the first three Toes of the Human Foot.

                               Bij J. Paek Harrison, M.A.

Last autumn, at Southampton, tlie author mentioned that a long second toe,,

though commonly met with in the works of Italian painters and scidptors, hoth

ancient and modern, seldom occurs in unrestored feet of Greek statues.

Finding an impression prevalent that it was a natural or normal feature, he

examined, in 1876, the feet of Scotch and Irish children at Glasgow, principally

boys between nine and twelve years of age, when it was found that there was no

tendency to the pecvdiarity in that part of the kingdom ; and it was ascertained

subsequently to be exceptional in adult males in Great Britain and Ireland

generally. It is not unfrequently met with in female feet in England ; and Dr.

Pruner Bey found that it was common amongst Alsatian women. Possibly this

m Amay be owing to some peculiarity shoes.  second toe longer than the first, or

great toe, appears to have characterised the Umbrians and Etruscans ; and it still

exists in Italy amongst their descendants. This probably accounts for the excessive

length of the second toe in Raphael's pictures. It is believed to have characterised
the Carians and some other tribes of Asia Minor, and also one of the early Egyptian

races.

     The author thinks that the feature was not adopted by the ancient artists from
any ideal motive, but always represented the native form of the foot. lie men-
tioned that it was common in the Pacific and Peru, but was not a character of the

lower races generally.'

        6. On the Antiquittj of Man in Ireland. By W. J. Knowles.

     The author stated that it was not acknowledged that anj' implements older tlian
neolithic were found in Ireland, but lately he had found certain pear-shaped imple-
ments at Larne and other parts of the north-east coast of Ireland, which he believed

to be not only older than neolithic, but far older even than palseolithic implements.

They are more or less cylindrical in shape, and pointed, with a dressed butt for
holding in the hand, and difl'er from palaeolithic implements in not being flat witli
cutting edges. The author believed tliat the men who used these implements had
a fixed idea of making pointed implements more or less cylindrical in form, just as
the paleolithic people made flat pointed implement.s or the neolithic people imple-
ments with a cutting edge at the broad end. Part of them were obtained from
gravels near Larne, and some at other parts of the north-east coast. One was
obtained from boulder clay, and another tine implement was found having glacial
markings on the chipped surface. The author showed some natural flint stones
which, in his opinion, may have suggested the pear-shaped form, and he believed
the palaeolithic implements presented a further development of the same idea.
Reference was made to Professor Boyd Dawkius' work, ' Early JMan in Britain,'
where he looks on the remains of the extinct mammalia found in Ireland, such
as the mammoth, a tooth of which has been found near Larne, as 'the remains of
a preglacial faima which happen to have been preserved in spite of the erosion of
the surface by glaciers.' The author was inclined to adopt this view, and was of
opinion that the pear-shaped objects which he exhibited were the implements used

in hunting this preglacial fauna.

 6. On a Human Shull found near Southport. By G. B. Barron, M.I).,

   A few years ago, some workmen in making a deep cutting at Birkdale, near

Southport, discovered a human skull, fifteen feet below the surface, lying on a bed

of laminated clay ; the rest of the skeleton was not looked for, unfortunately. It
had evidently been severed from the trunk by the planks driven down to prevent

the sides of the trench slipping. In immediate proximity were found also the horns

and bones of the great Irish elk, and, not far distant, abundant roots and trunks of

forest trees, chiefly oak and ash, belonging to a submerged forest, no doubt co-ex-

tensive with the submerged forest known to exist along the Lancashire and Cheshire
coasts. The skuU was in a state of good preservation, being covered with a coating
of peroxide of iron, deposited on it from percolation. It is now in the Museum of

the Royal College of Surgeons, but a cast is exhibited.

    A similar skull was discovered at Leasowe, some distance off, under similar

geological conditions. These skulls are the only ones of the same type found in
the North of England. They are identical with each other, and are dolicho-cephalic,

orthognathic and aphanorygous, and they pertain to the Eskimo.

      In the district surrounding Southport full evidence of an old submerged forest

is to be found, and in it there can be no doubt the Irish elk and some other extinct

animals lived and roamed.

      Southport is built on the site of this submerged forest, of which there is abun-

dant proof by the frequent exposure of trunks and roots of trees, buried at some

depth below the surface, all lying on laminated clay, the trees having been cut down
five or six feet above the roots. The geology of Southport and district is post-
tertiary, so far as it has been tested, and remains in much the same state as left by

the glaciers of the ice age, the action of which, all along the coast-line, has been

that of deposition, accretion, and formation of moraines, with peat and drift-sand

superimposed. The deluge theory of this submergence is not tenable. The author

does not believe that a deluge ever touched this forest or this part of Europe.

      Borings to a depth of 600 feet have only revealed sand-drift, marine-shells, allu-

vial peaty loam, peat, laminated clay, grey clay, and boulder clay, with stones.

In some places the upper boulder clay, intercalated with sandy drift, lies on the
Keuper marl. Erratics of Shap granite are very abundant in the boulder clay of
the district, most of which are well scored. Elks' horns, as thick as a man's wrist,
have been found, and >-ougfi flint heads and implements have been frequently met
with. The village of Crossens, adjacent to Southport, stands on a heap of boulder
clay, and fifteen feet below the surface is a bed of fine pebbles, &c., with water

carrying sand.

   A general subsidence of this coast has occurred, cariying with it the forest,

when sda invasion took place, after which an upheaval came on, again elevating

the land above the sea-level. This upheaval appears to be going on, although the
relative levels of land and sea have not been materially altered for several thousanda..

of years.

     Taking the geological surroundings, and the entire absence of any other data to
elucidate the antiquity or otherwise of these human remains, it can only be concluded
that they belong to the period of the Cave Man. This opinion is strengthened by the

fact that evidence of Cave man has been discovered in Cefn Cave, not very distant

from Southport, across the estuary of the Mersey. That the Palaeolithic hunter
did inhabit the above cave, there is not a shadow of a doubt, and he had no other
hunting ground than the forests of Flintshire, Cheshire, and Lancashire, which were

continuous. It seems probable, then, that this man hunted in this great primeval

forest, and the Irish elk was one of his quarries ; that he died in it, and was sub-
merged with it, and that he was a Palseolithic hunter, and had not human sepulture..
But if not a Palteolith, he could not be later than the very earliest Neolith, before
the latter was civilised, and before he had begun to use polished implements.
There is, however, no satisfactory evidence to disqualify the opinion that he was a?

Palaeolithic hunter.

     After referring to the opinion that the great building-races of antiquity were
Turanians, and that the civilisations of Chaldea, Egypt, and Phoenicia were trace-

able to a common source in Western Asia, facts were mentioned in support of th^

                                                                     oo2

belief that the civilisation of the Dravidians, who were the preat architects of
India, originated at the same centre. Reference was also made to the Turanian
affinity of the Dravidians, and the existence among the ancient Chaldeans

of a Turanian race, which possessed an advanced civilisation. This civilisa-
tion would seem, as supposed by M. Lenormant and other writers, to have been

handed down from pre-deluge times to the Turanians, and to have been transmitted
by them to the Ilamitico-Kushites. Facts such as the invention of the arts of
metallurgy and architecture were mentioned to show that the ancient Turanians
were in reality Cainites, a conclusion which was supported by the consideration
of social and religious phenomena. The pre-Ueluge history of Genesis furnishes

evidence of the existence of an hereditary enmity between the descendants of Cain
and those of Seth, and also a diflerence of religion, such as afterwards subsisted
between the Caucasian races and the Turanians. The prevalence of serpent worship

among the latter was referred to, and reasons were adduced for believing that the
people who erected the Naga Temples of Cambodia were allied to the pre-Aryan

race of Northern India, with whom the Hindoo Pandavas were probably also con-

nected. The peculiar developmeot of serpent worship among the Egyptians and
the Chinese, as well as its existence among the Hamitic and Turanian peoples

generally, with the latter of whom it was probably a primeval superstition, was

dwelt upon as further evidence of the athuity between those peoples. In conclu-
sion, reference was made to a mark which is said to te found on the hip of every
new-born Chinese child, and also to a similar mark mentioned by Mr. John Morris
as distinguishing individuals belonging, aa he supposes, to the true Hamitic stock,

and it was suggested that the tradition as to the mark of Cain may be based on

such a phenomenon.

          2. On a Flint Implement found on Torre-Abbey Sands, Torbay.

                           By W. Pengellt, F.B.S., F.G.8.
     On January 26, 1883, Mr. II. W. Watson, of Torquay, found a flint implement

 lying on the well-known submerged forest, Torre-Abbey Sands, Torbay, near the
  ordinary spring tide low-water line, and he was so good as to submit it to me. It
  is 4'8 inches long, I'oo inch in greatest width, Q inch in greatest thickness, round
  at each end, but broader and thicker at one than the other; convex on one margin,
  but slightly concave on the other, '3 inch thick at the broader end, and "2 inch at
  the narrower. Its inner face is slightly concave longitudinallj", and convex trans-
  versely, it has a slight ' bulb of percussion ' near its broader end, and is nowhere
  smooth. The outer face is convex, and divided into two unequal slopes by a ridge
  inclining towards the convex edge of the tool. The abrupter slope has undergone
  a considerable amount of dressing ; the concave edge is thin and comparatively
  sharp, while the convex edge has apparently seen some service. It does not
  apepar to have been rolled or scratched, and all the facts connected with it point

to its having teen dislodged from tlie forest bed very shortly before the time, and
very near the spot, on which it was found. There appears to be neither record nor

tradition of any stone tools having been previously found under circumstances
suggestive of a forest derivation in South Devon ; but flint flakes and ' cores ' have
been met with in considerable numbers in the submerged forest of Barnstaple Bay,

North Devon. An antler of red deer, fashioned into a rude but unmistakable tool,

was found in the Torbay forest as long ago as 1852, and had thus prepared the

mind for Mr. Watson's discovery. The same forest has yielded remains of mam-

moth, red deer, wild hog, Bos longifrons, and sheep, or goat.

              3. Three Golden Gups. By Miss A. W. Buckland.

     From three cups of gold of similar pattern, which have been found, one in

Cornwall, one in Mj'cenae, and one in the necropolis of ancient Tarquinia, Miss
Buckland endeavours to show that some commercial iutercoiu'se must have existed
between Mediterranean peoples and the British Isles during the bronze age, to
which period the Cornish cup is assigned by antiquaries.

     It is pointed out that the museum of Corneto-Tarquinia contains, in addition
to the cup so strongly resembling that found in Cornwall, many other articles in
gold, which have been classed with that cup by such competent authorities as Dr.
Evans and Mr. Franks, and especially a lunula, and some of those articles, usually
regarded as clasps, or as having been used as money, which are found in abundance

in Ireland, lunulce. having also been found in Cornwall and Scotland.
     Miss ]3uckland infers from these discoveries that Mediterranean races, and

particularly the Etruscans, had established a commerce, and formed some kind of
settlement in Ireland and perhaps in Cornwall, in prehistoric times, and points out
that this is entirely in accordance with Irish legends, which invariably bring the
heroes and founders of the nation from the shores of the Mediterranean. This pre-
historic settlement, if established by further investigations, is looked upon as likely
to clear up many obscure points in anthropology, archjeology, and folk-lore; as
barbarous races, then, as now, would naturally be slowly changed, and instructed
in the arts of civilisation, by intercourse with those more advanced than them-

selves.

4. 0)1 the Koehoes and other Tribes of Sumatra, and on some Customs

   prevalent among the Inhahitants of Timor. By H. O. Foebes, F.Z.S.

  --The author, during five years' journeyiugs in the East, visited many of the

islands of the Malay Archipelago Java, Sumatra, Amboina, Am, Ke, the Ten-

imber Islands (generally called Timor-laut), (vide Report of B.A. Committee,

Section D, for the present year; and P.Z.S., 1873, February 20, April 17,

May 1 and June 5), Boeroe and Timor. In Sumatra he visited, among other

districts, the little-known people living in the plateau of the Passoemah Lands,

who were described as pagans, having many curious customs ; in this region he

discovered several large stone images and sculptures, about which there appear

to be no traditions as to their use, or by whom they were made, among the peoples

of these lands, but which cannot be referred to the work of the Hindoos. Farther

to the north, on the boundaries of the Djambi country, the author fell in with the

forest-dwelling tribe of the Koehoes, supposed by some to be the remnants of the

Aorigmal inhabitants of the island.  short account of their habits was given, and

a female cranium exhibited to the section. The author then passed on to give

some account of the inhabitants of the Portuguese portion of Timor, through which,

by exceptional privileges given to him by his Excellency Senlior da Franca, the

Governor, he was able to travel. He described their customs relating to marriage,

or Barlaque, drawing special attention to the existence in some districts of husband-

clans and wife-clans. He next referred to what appeared to be part of their

religious ritual, known among them under the name of Loelik ; and lastly, to their

death-rites.

The author also drew attention to the supposed existence in Timor of a tribe of

Negritoes,

      5. On the Cranial Characters of the Ivhahitanfs of TimoT'laut.
                               By J. G. Garson, M.D.^

The osteological remains received of the inhabitants of Timor-laut from Mr.

Forhea's expedition consist of a series of eleven skulls and crania. Of these nine

are adult, one is that of a youth of about twenty years of age, and one is that of

a child. Four of the skulls are those of males, and six those of females. The

skull of the child may belong to either sex. All except the skulls of one female

and that of  the child  are  broad  in  proportion  to  their length                                                the latter two are
                                                                                                                 ;

narrow in proportion to their length.

     The average cranial capacity of the four male skulls measured according to
Broca's method is 1,607 c.c, while the five round-headed females average 1,327 c.c.
Compared with European skulls tlie average of the male skulls from Timor-laut

is somewhat larger, while the size of the female skulls is smaller than those of

Europeans. The difference between the size of the males and females is 280 c.c,

while that between the two sexes of Europeans is 185 c.c.

    The cephalic index, or the relation of the maximum length and the maximum

breadth, varies little except in the long-headed skulls, in which the maximum length

.is greater and the breadth less than in any of the other skulls. The round skulls

belong to Broca's class, true brachycephalic, e.xcept one of these skulls, which falls

within the sub-brachycephalic class from its width being less than ia the others,

though the length is the normal. The long skulls both belong to the true dolicho-

cephalic.

     The height index is greater in the brachycephalic females than in the males
by 2. In the dolichocephalic female the heifjht index is much lower than in the

brachycephalic, a condition which the late Professor RoUeston usually found to

obtain in dohcbocephalic skulls. The height of the skulls is in all instances except

one less than the breadth.

The horizontal circumference of the male skuUs averages 607 mm., and of the

females 475 mm., while the transverse circumference of the former ia 456 mm., and
of the latter 424 mm. ; between the two circumferences of botli sexes there is a

difference of 32 mm. The horizontal circumference of the dolichocephalic female

ia greater, while the transverse circumference is less, than that of any of the other

females. The greater size of tliis latter skull is owing to the anterior segment

toeing largely developed.

One of the male skulls is orthoguathous, the other slculls of both sexes are

mesognathous, except one male skull, which is just within the prognathous group,

and the dolichocephalic female, which is prognathous.

    From the orlntal index averaging 85-1 in the males and S4-7 in the females,

both belong to the mesoseme group as regards the form of the orbit.

The form of the nasal aperture varies. The males are on the average at the

platyrhine end of the mesorhine group, while the females are just within the

vplatyrhine group.

The chin is somewhat rounded and less pointed than in Europeans.

Flattening of the occipital or parieto-occipital region e-xists in almost all the

specimens, but in some it is more marked than in others. The forehead is well

formed, without prominent ridges. The nasal region is flattened, but the degree

of flattening seems to vary in different individuals.

The result of the observations of the osteology of the people shows that we

have two distinct racial elements amongst these, namely the Malayan and the

Melanesian. The former is represented by the brachycephalic skulls, which are the

more numerous, the latter by the dolichocephalic skulls.

7. On the Words Celt, German, and Slavonian, their Misinterpretation,
                   and its Results. By Dr. R. G. Latham.

Of these three names the first is as old as Herodotus, the second dates from

the time of Julius Caesar, the third is no older than the seventh century a.d.

     The term Slave, Sklave, Sclavonian, &c., is, according to the strong conviction
of the present, no definite name at all, but a word lilie Trrtmontane in Latin, and

sa-o-ora, za.-volo7c, i.e. heyond the mountain and beyond the watershed, in Slavic. If

so sa-laba would be over the river (or water), and as such would be applicable to

any portion of the area which we now call Sclavonic. Hence it is not a national

--name at all, though, at the same time, when we know what it means and what

it does not mean, it is a convenient one convenient because in the words like

Pa7islav(jnism we find it recognised.
     There is no great misrepresentation here, and Slavonic as a word is connected

with Celt and German, not for what it represents, but for the extent to which it is

misrepresented.

This brings us to a point of some importance : (1) If the Celtic area of

antiquity was as large as it is supposed to be, there was no such being as _a

Slavonian south  of the Danube                                                                        (2)  and  if  the German area was so large  as it is
                                                                                                   ;

supposed to be, there would be no Slavonism to the north of that river. Instead of

them we should have Celts to the south, and no Germans to the north of that

--river practically no area larger than the county of York, of which Slavonians

were occupants ; indeed, from a certain point of view there would be no Slavonians

in Europe till about A.d. (JOO, when they present them in force both to the south

and the north of the Danube, especially in the districts which ten years before were

assigned to the Celts and Germans.

    From this comes the question, ' Whence come the Slavonians ? and whither

went the Celts and Germans ?
     This and the answer to it is the question which the present writer investigates,

not, of course, in full detail, but sufficiently to indicate the amount and character
of what he unwillingly calls the ?n«interpretation of two classical authorities, or
rather the mt'sinterpretation of Tacitus in the case of the Germans, and the neglect

of a special statement in E^horus, as preserved by Straho, in regard to the Celts.

8. On a Pile Dwelling recently discovered at TJlrome, in Holderness,
            Yorkshire. By James W. Davis, F.S.A., F.G.S.

Formerly a great part of Ilolderness was covered by a series of lakes and

meres, only the slightly hilly parts being elevated sufficiently to form dry land.

Some years ago the country was drained artificially, and during the operation

Thomas Boynton, Esq., of Ulrome Grange, discovered some implements and fragments

of wood which had apparently been used as piles. In consequence of these dis-

coveries Mr. Boynton was led to e.xcavate one of the sites, and found that it had
Abeen pierced about midway in making the drain.
                                                                                                                    space about 20 yards square

has been cleared and the plan followed in the construction of the dwellings is

clearly exposed. The base of the structure is formed by a number of large trunks

of trees, several being 18 inches in diameter ; these were laid horizontally on a

bed of peat aljout 2 feet in thickness, which being superimposed on a bed of gravel,

in all probability formed the bed of the lake. The tree-trunks are held in position

by a number of pointed stakes, driven into the peat beneath, on each side the

trunks. The stakes or piles have been cut by a very rude implement, probably
the stone adzes or axes found associated with the remains of the buildings. The

horizontal timbers were laid apparently without anj' definite arrangement, and tlie

spaces between them were tilled up with broken twigs, bark, and the chippings cut

from the piles, until a level surface was obtained above the surface of the water of

the lake. On this the builders probablj- erected their domiciles, though no trace of

them remains at the present time. Above the siuface of broken twigs and bai'k

there has been an accumulation of 3 feet of peat and about 1 foot of warp and soil,

so that the base of the dwelling is about 6 feet above the bed of the ancient lake,

and 3 to 4 feet below the present surface of the ground, the whole being about

10 feet in thickness. During the excavations numerous objects have been found

which throw light on the habits of the people who erected and occupied the

--dwellings rounded stone implements, probably used for pounding grain, stone

axes and hammers, worljed smooth and pierced for the introduction of a handle.

Several large bones, probably the femur or humerus of the cow, have been broken

in two diagonally across the shaft, and a hole drilled through near the joint, into

which a stick was inserted, forming implements which may have been used for

breaking up the land. The antlers of the red deer were in all probability used for

a similar purpose, and several have been found. Numerous pieces of pottery have

Abeen discovered                                                              single bronze spear-head has been

found, and a few examples of flint implements.

It may be inferred, from the remains found during excavation and the character

of the portion of the dwellings which remains, that the people were devoted to

agricultural pursuits, that the dwellings were erected a short distance from the

edge of the lake for protection against wild animals rather than for defence against

human foes, and that their implements of bone were well adapted for working in

the light sandy or warpy soils which occupied the higher ground rising from the

border of the lake.

1. The Influence of Town Life on Stature, llij J. Park Harrison, ilf. J.

    From a comparison of the average stature of the population in towns of 5,000

inhabitants and upwards with that of pure country folk in the British Isles, the
Anthropometric Committee in 1881 found that town life aflects stature to a far less
extent than had been before supposed.

The author has extracted from the tables in the above Report the average

stature of artisans in towns of the ages of twenty-five to thirty-five, and those of

country labourers of the same age; on c6mparing them, the diflt'i-ence is 0-92 inches

in favour of the country folk.^

Stature  has  been    found  to  be  low  in                                         ;  but  if  the  average                                       stature  of  the

                                              Bristol "

inhabitants of that town is compared with that of the nearest county from which

--there are a sufficient number of observations-- viz. Somer.setshiVe then the

respective statures are found to be 5 feet o-77 inches and 5 feet 6-30 inches, the

difference being -.53, on 300 and 4-i7 observations. It is therefore probable if a
larger number of observations of stature from Edinburgh and Glasgow were

obtained, the average stature in those cities would prove to be higher than 5 feet

6-35 inches.

          2. AntliroxKymetry. By J. G. Gakson, jSLB.

The methods of measuring the hiiman body, whether it he the living subject or

the skeleton, have been so diverse that the results obtained by one observer can

seldom be utilised and extended by another : each anthropologist using more or less

different measurements. That a general understanding be come to, so as to obtain

one sj'stem which would be universally used, is very desirable. Two measurements,

both  of  gTeat importance, will be dealt with in this commimication                                                                                                                                                                                                                              these are the ·
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

measurements of length of the skull and of its capacity.

The length of the skull has been taken as (1) the length between the nasion

and the most distant part of the occipital bone in the mesial line (2) the distance
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

between the most prominent parts of the glabella and tbe occiput ; and (3) the

length between the ophryon and the most distant part of the occiput. The first

measurement of length has only been used by a few anthropologists in Germany,

and as it has not found much favour may be discarded, especially as it is not one

that recommends itself. The second method has been perhaps the most generally

adopted on the Continent. It is tlie maximum length of the skull, and can be

ascertained with ease and accuracy, alike on the living subject and on the skull, a

matter of great importance. It has been usual to measure the length of the head

in the living in this way, and the only objection that can be urged against its being

adopted also for the skull is that the glabella includes tbe frontal sinuses, which

are liable to vary in size and prominence. The ophryo-occipital length has usually

been adopted in this country, and the advantages claimed for it are that it does

not include the air sinuses, and that it represents more accurately the length of the

hrain. Its disadvantages are that the ophryon is not a delinite point, but will be

placed higher or lower on the frontal bone by different observers ; the frontal

bone being curved, the length of tbe skull will vary according to the position of the-

point considered as the ophryon. The adoption of the one or the other of these

measurements should depend upon its relative advantages. The advantages of the

ophryo-occipital length appear to be more apparent than real, as in any case it is

only a veiy approximate estimate of the length of the brain that can be obtained

from it, owing to the different thicknesses of different skulls both in the region of

the ophryon and occiput, while the disadvantage of its being nncertaiu, owing to

different points being fi.xed as the ophryon by different, observers, is a very serious

objection to it. The glabello-occipital measurement of length appears to the author-

to present greater advantages and less disadvantages tban the ophryo-occipital. He

therefore thinks that the former should be adopted universally as the length measure-

ment, not only of the skull, but also of the head of the living subject.

The capacity of the skull would be best ascertained by filling it with water or-

mercury, and then measuring the quantity used for that purpose. This is not

possible, however", from its porous and irregular character, not to mention its

Wenumerous foramina.  have, therefore, to resort to the use of solid substances.

For this purpose sand has been used, but is now abandoned as not being satisfactory.

Filling the cranium with mustard seed, and gently rolling it backwards and for-

wards and from side to side at intervals diuing the process, was practised by Mr.

Busk, but has likewise not been found satisfactorj^, owing to the results obtained

being uncertain, and the capacity indicated being less than the actual capacity..

Shot was used by Morton, but with indifferent success. It was not until intro-

ducing the maximum quantity of shot or seed was practised that more certain;

results were obtained. Professor Flower modified Mr. Busk's method with mustards

seed by tapping on the skull while the seed was being introduced, and again

whilst the quantity which had been got into the cranium was being ascertained

by pouring the seed into a gi-aduated glass vessel, the seed being run into the-

skuU and into the measuring glass through the same funnel. This method, while
.570                              REPOET-- 1883.

equalising the process of filling the skull and ascertaining its cubage, is open to the

serious objection that the quantity of seed which can be introduced into the skull,
and Ukewise the space it will occupy in the measure, depends upon the amount of
tapping practised. There being no means of regulatuig this, the result obtained
depends upon the observer. Variations to the amount of 25 to 40 c.c. are not un-
frequent in different measurements of the capacity of one and the same skull by

the same observer. Broca, some years ago, introduced a system of measuring the
capacity with shot, according to a method whereby the measurer is made to play a
secondary part, the accuracy being dependent upon the system which has been

minutely described in his work on craniology. By this system the skull is filled as

fuU as possible with shot of a given size, according to certain directions which he
o-ives. The quantity which has been introduced into the skull is then measured in
glass vessels according to a fixed plan. The results of this method show that the
variations between different manipulations on the same skull do not vary more than
from 6 to 10 c.c, any greater variation than this occurring indicates that some error
has been made in the process. The advantages of this method at first sight appear
to be very great, but unfortunately the results obtained from it are somewhat greater
than the actual capacity such as would be obtained by filling the cranial cavity with
fluid. This error is, however, a relative one, and can be corrected by ascertaining

how much the capacity measured with shot is greater than the actual capacity.

This can be done by careful measurement of some test skulls rendered impervious
to fluids, with shot, and water or mercury. Notwithstanding its disadvantage in
this respect, the author thinks Broca's metliod is the most trustworthy and the best

one for estimating the capacity, and would therefore recommend its adoption.

A3. new Method of comimring the Forms of Skulls. By W. S. DuNCAX.

The author brought forward a new method of comparing the forms of skulls so

as to bring out their relative characters by the superposition of their outlines.

Outlines in profile had first to  be  made  full-size from the  actual  skulls                              marking
                                                                                                         ;

the basion, the alveolar point, and the glabella or the nasion very carefully, then

drawing the basi-alveolar line and dropping a perpendicular to the latter from the

glabella or the nasion. All the skuU outlines must then be re-drawn to suit a

common standard height of the glabella, or of the nasion, above the basi-alveolar

line ; that is, the perpendicular from the glabella (if that point bemused) must be
the same in all the outlines to be compared, or the perpendicular from the nasion

(supposing that point is preferred), must be of the same length in all the series--

without altering the shape of any one skull, or the relation of its parts to one

another in position or size ; which is easily done by means of proportional com-

passes.

     Then tracings are made of each of the skull-outlmes thus assimilated in the

height of glabella or nasion above the basi-alveolar line, and they are placed over
each other so that the basi-alveolar line in each shall coincide in position, and so
that the perpendicular drawn thereto from the glabella or from the nasion shall

entirely coincide.

     Top views or plans must be made by drawing outlines projected upon a plane
parallel to the basi-alveolar line, and end views upon a plane perpendicular to the

basi-alveolar line.

     As the result of such treatment the author exhibited outlines of two species of
Orang, Simia satyrus and Simia morio, which were by this metliod clearly seen to
illustrate the law that a diminished prognathism was accompanied by increased
cranial development. The same truth was illustrated by profiles of skulls of a
chimpanzee and a gorilla superposed ; by those of two chimpanzees superposed ; by

outlines of a Fijian and an Australian skull superposed.
     The author further applied the method by the superposition of an orang's skull-

outline over the outline of the skull of an Andamanese, and contrived intermediate
stages of jaw-reduction and cranium-expansion so as to indicate the type of the
ancestral forms of the Andamanese skull. Without alleging that the ancestors of the

Andamanese were orangs the author contended that they were probably orang-like

in the breadth of the brain-case compared with its length, for, omitting the ridges

on the side of the orang skull, the skull of the orang and that of the native Andaman

islander were both brachycephalic : and both were, in the region of the glabella,

remarkably smooth, and devoid of brow-ridge as compared with other types of

human and ape-skulls.

   A series of nine link outlines thus deduced were exhibited, in which the author

had allowed a decreasing rate of jaw-reduction for equal degrees of cranium

expression.

The author observed that link 1, in his Orang to Andamanese series, corre-

sponded in length of jaw to Simia morio, but that the cranium of the latter was

relatively more developed. This, together with similar facts, he showed indicated

that greater progress may have been made in the increase of ci"anium than in the

reduction of the size of the jaws in the bygone evolution of the human skull, so

that, in looking for links, isolated jaws may have been ape-like in dimensions while

belonging to well-developed crania                                                                                                                                     similarly, isolated  crania  may have  had  con-
                                                                                                                                                                    ;

siderably ape-like jaws associated with them, though the crania are to all appear-

ance those of human proportions.

In the same manner links wei"e deduced between the chimpanzee and Australian

types of skull, in which prominence of brow ridge and dolichocephale were associated.
This the author admitted was no proof that the ancestors of Australians were

chimpanzees, but merely indicated that they were probably intermediate in typical

form.

Outlines of the Neanderthal calvarium and of an Irish calvarium in the Phreno-

logical jNJuseum of Edinburgh were superposed upon an Australian skull outline,

with the result of diminishing the importance of the Neanderthal calvariimi as

respects inferiority of development ; the Irish being smaller in all respects than

the Neanderthal calvarium. But inasmuch as the calvaria in question were so
fragmentary, it was impossible to indicate with any approach to exactness the type

of the facial portion that must have belonged to these skulls originally.

4. Local Science Societies and the minor Prc-liistoric Heniains of Britain.^

                                  By R. Meldola, F.G.S.

     This paper, which was first read at the Conference of Delegates from local
societies, and had been referred by the Conference to the Anthropological Section
in order to give it greater publicity, contained some suggestions which the author
had first put forward in his presidential address to the Essex Field Club. The

author proposed that all the local societies throughout the country should co-
operate in the production of a complete catalogue of all tlie prehistoric remains of
Britain, giving their position, external form and structure, and bibliographical

references. He further suggested that the various local societies should form pre-

historic monuments committees, for the purpose of drawing up the catalogue, and
at the same time conducting, if possible, actual explorations of all doubtful remains.
These local committees would also act as vigilance committees, keeping watch
upon all the ancient remains in their neighbourhood, and preventing as far as
possible their destruction. In cases where, through building or agricultural opera-

tions, demolition is unavoidable, the author suggested that the local societies should

appoint watchers to record the presence of any relics that might be found. The
author stated in conclusion that the neglect of such opportimities by local societies
in past times had led to the loss.of a vast amount of evidence which might have
been of the greatest importance to anthropology, and he urged upon local societies
the adoption of a useful line of work which would necessarily increase the efliiciency
of Sir John Lubbock's Ancient Monuments Bill.

    The author stated tliat, in consequence of the publication hy Lady Brassey of the
'Voyage of the Sunbeam,' great attention bad been paid to these Indians by men
of science here and in Germany. On examination of the language he foimd that
its relations were of a distinct character with a group in Ai'rica, and with the
Ngoten, &e., particularly. This raised an important question as to the mode in
which the language had been transmitted to the extremity of South America.

                    6. Primitive Astronomical Traditions as to Paradise.

                                   By R. G. Halibcrton.

     The author had met with a great mass of primitive legends among savages as
to a primaeval paradise, with its Tree of Life and of Knowledge, being situated in
the stars of Taurus, the Pleiades. As far back as 1863 he privately printed a

paper entitled ' New Materials for the History of ^lan, derived from a comparison

of the Calendars and Festivals of Nations.' In the course of these astronomical
researches, he had met, to his surprise, with curious traditions as to a Paradise and

deluge, the cross, a tree or bough, and a bird connected with the primitive year and
its festivals. lie had since devoted much careful study to this enigma, and the
present paper gave only a portion of these investigations, for the subject was too

wide to be outlined in a paper. Half a century ago, many learned works were

devoted to coincidences in the religious ideas, traditions, and symbols of nations
and it was by some supposed that they were distorted vestiges of the sacred
nan-ative, but this view had been abandoned, and all these learned investigations

had been discredited. "We now cut the Gordian knot, which we cannot solve, as
to these common traditions and beliefs, and suppose them of indigenous growth.
But, while this conclusion might, in many instances, be right, there were many

coincidences too arbitrary and widely spread to admit of the solution that the
beliefs and religious ideas of primitive races were all the emanations of darkness,
stagnation, and decay. The author then selected some American traditions as to
the Tree of Life and Paradise. The symbols of a cross and a bough or tree, he
thought, were suggested by the form of the Pleiades, which when they set have a
remarkable resemblance to a prostrate tiee. The Kiowas of the prairies believe
that in the shape of the Pleiades and of some adjoining stars can be seen the form
of their great Father in Heaven, the great Kiowa. Once upon a time he went far
to the West and met with a prostrate tree or trunk which he struck three times.

At the first stroke human beings of misshapen, monstrous forms came forth. These
he put to rights, placed them back in the tree and struck it a second time, when per-
fect men and women came forth from this tree of life. He placed them again in
the tree, and struck it a third time, when men and women and children that had
been born, came out of it. He instructed the men and women in the rude arts of

savage life, and then went up to the Pleiades. This belief in our having sprung
from a tree is well kuown in the Old World, in Britain, Lapland, Gei-many,

Greece, Persia, and other countries. An Indian tribe of the Pampas, the Abipones,

believe that their Great Father resides in the Pleiades, and when these stars
disappear from the heavens for a time, it is believed that he dies or is ill, and when

those stars reappear his revival is hailed with joy. This gives a clue to the death
and revival of the gods of antiquity. These people use the symbol of those ' stars
of raiu,' the prehistoric cross, as an ornament or sacred sign. There is also a

curious tradition of seven giant brothers, who fished off the west coast of Canada.
They struck a huge monster with a harpoon. As the rope could not be loosened,

they were dragged far into the ocean towards a vast whirlpool. Just as they

neared it, the rope broke, and they sailed up to the Pleiades, where they are now

visible as the seven stars. These seven brothers give us a clue to the seven

Cabeiric brothers, of Phoenician tradition, who sailed in the first ship, and who

have been identified with the Pleiades by Movers. But the story of the whirlpool
is especially important, for we meet it in the traditions of the Dyaks of Borneo^

some of the ancestors of whom, as they were sailing in a boat, saw near a great

Awaterfall the boughs of a tree touching the waters, and loaded with fruit.

Dvak climbed up the tree to see where its roots grew. He found out the enio-ma

which is described in the Song of Odin, who hung nine days from a mystic tree,

* of which no one Isnows where its roots grow.' The Dyak reached a heavenly

country, ' the land of the Pleiades, where he was taught agriculture, and other

arts, by a kind being who dwells there, and then, bringing with him from the

Pleiades the gift of rice or com, he was let down by a rope from the seven stars,

and imparted to his countrymen the mystic lore which he had learned by climbing

that tree of knowledge.' This waterfall recalls the waterfall of the river" Styx, and

the whirlpool of the llaida tradition; also the whirlpool of Scylla and Charybdis,

Aover which hung a great fig tree.                                                                  great number of interesting points were

adduced connecting the primitive traditions of the natives of America and Polynesia

with those of the Old World. The three Graces were, among the Iroquois, three

loving sisters in the Pleiades, the spirits of the bean, the squash, and maize, their

--gifts to mortals. They are called ' Our Life, our Supporters ' the very words

addressed to the spirit of agi-iculture in Mexico, and to this day in the Atlas

country. The Lyciaii women of old invoked the bull to come and bring the

Graces with                       him                        and                 the  bull  of the  mysteries                     is     represented with  the   three

Graces on its head, and the Pleiades following them. This referred to the constel-

lation Taurus, or the bull, in which the Pleiades were placed. ^Vhen ' the bull

Newwith its wliite horns opened the year,' it brought, all over the world, a kindly

Year's feast of family love. Even among the head-hunting Dyaks of Borneo,

Bishop Chalmers was asked on New Year's Day to go out to the assembled people
and to give them his wishes for a happy New Year. In many parts of the world it

is followed by visits, gifts, and good wishes. This is one of the oldest and most

xmiversal festivals.

    The following Papers were read :

        1. The Polynesians and their Origin. By C. Staniland "Wake.

     The paper mentioned various facts showing that the physical features of the
Polynesians, although often European, allied them rather to the Mongolian than to
the Caucasian stock. This opinion was confirmed by reference to vai-ious mental
574 KEroRT-- 1883.

and social characteristics, which appeared to connect them with the Taranian

peoples of India. Mr. Pomander's theorj' of a pre-Vedic Aryan origin for the

Polynesians was considered, and it was suggested that a Dravidian origin for them

was more probable. This view agreed with the opinion expressed by Mr. Keane

as to a connection between the Polynesians and the Khmers of Cambodia, seeing

that, as the paper showed, the Khmers were settlers from Upper India, and pro-

bably Dravidians, more or less Aryanised. Their occupation of Cambodia would

lead to a movement among the native inhabitants, many of whom fled to the

AIndian islands.  similar movement would appear to have taken place at a later

period during the era of Wakea, a chief of Gilolo, about the first century B.C.,

when the migrations of the Polynesians over the Pacific began. They doubtless,

however, followed in the footsteps of peoples belonging to the same stock, a

tradition of whose vovages would be handed down to the Polynesians.

             2. The Germanic and Bhcetian Ulemeiits in Switzerland.

                            By John Beddoe, M.I)., F.E.S.

    The anthropology of Switzerland has been much studied, and to a great extent
disentangled, by His and Riitimeyer, Dunant, Guillaume, Kollmann, Studer, and
the investigators of the lake-dwellings. The author had lately visited the eastern
part of the country, and collated with his personal observations what these authors

have stated as to the stature, coloui-, and head-form of the people.
     The Swiss, or at least the eastern and central Swiss, speaking for the most part

High Dutch, used to be reckoned with ourselves as a Teutonic people. There is,^
however, one strong objection to be taken to a system of classification of European
peoples which ranks together the English and the Swiss. The head-form of the
former is distinctly long, and that of the latter short and broad. The English form
may be called by some orthocephalic, or mesocephalic, or mesaticephalic, but it
certainly inclines pretty decidedly to the long end of the scale. Dr. Barnard
Davis, in his ' Thesaurus,' puts the mean index of longitude at 76 or 77 : probably

about 77 is correct. Now His and lUitimeyer assign a breadth-index of over

86 to their typical Disentis skull, and ascribe to the Disentis type the majority of

modern Swiss heads. I am not aware that anyone has ventured to state an

average index for Switzerland ; but such average would evidentlj' be somewhere
very far beyond 80, as is the case in most, if not all, of the surrounding countries,
as Savoy, Bavaria, Tj-roli, and, in a less marked degree, even Wiirtemberg and
Lombardy.

     On the other hand the distribution of colours among the Swiss does not differ
very notably from that which obtains among the English. One might be trans-

ported from Zurich to London, or vice versa, without noticing anything in the
complexions of the people to remind one of the fact. Nor are the prevailing
features by any means so different from those of the English as is the usual form

of head.

     The results of the official examination of the colours of hair and eyes in the
Swiss schools accord fairly well with the idea that the light complexion invaded
the country by crossuig the Rhine from Swabia into Aargau, and thence radiating
through the central cantons, but fining down considerably before reaching the
eastern and western frontiers. Putting the Celtic Helvetii for the moment out of
the question, this is what might be expected to remain as the evidence of the
AUemannic and Burgundian invasion. But, as we have reason to believe that both
the Allemans and the Burgamdians were long-headed as well as light-haired, we
might reasonably expect to find a longer head geographically accompanying the

lighter complexion. And so, probably, it does, but not so conspicuously as might

have been looked for. The point has not, so far as the author is aware, been worked
out by Swiss anthropologists with the detail which it merits.

     While welcoming the gigantic masses of statistics respecting colour of eyes and
hair which have been given ixs through the exertions of Virchow, Vanderkindere,
and Kollmamijthe author has always insisted on the necessity of remembering the im-
                                                                   --

portance of the personal equation. When, therefore, he finds in Dr. Kollmann's tahles
that the little canton of Nidwalden has very many more light-haired children than

any other one, he looks on the figures with some degree of suspicion. Partly for

this reason he visited Stanz, the interesting little capital of Nidwalden, noted the

colour of the people he met, and measured twenty skulls in the hone-house. He also

took observations of the hair and eyes in Zurich and in Ticino and in several parts

of the Grisons, measured thirty-six skulls in the ossuary of Davos, and some in that

of Disentis, as well as a few living heads in both these places.

He reserves the some-n-hat dry details for another phice, only mentioning, with

regard to colour, that he found the index of nigrescence, which measures the pre-

dominance of dark over light shades of hair, to vary as follows :

     This scale corresponds fairly with the supposed proportion of Allemannic blood.

Davos is more Germanic than most part of the Grisons ; the valley is said to have
been colonised by the German-speaking people of Upper Wallis.

    As for the form of the heads, the Disentis type, more or less modified, seems to

predominate even in Nidwalden and Davos ; he found the latitudinal index exactly

aUke in both these places, viz. 83-6. He was somewhat surprised to find it so great
in Nidwalden, wliere a great many of the inhabitants are blond and blue-eyed, and

have a decidedly Saxon-English type of features.

     There is more of light hair and blue eyes in the upper valleys of Ticino than
in the Ober-Eheinthal, where Eomantsch is spoken. Contrary to his previous
opinion, he is now inclined to recognise there notable remains of Lombard blood.

     The Disentis people are very interesting. It was not without reason that His
and Rtitimeyer gave the name to the broad-headed type. These Disentis folk
exhibit in the highest degree the combination of dark hair with short, broad slndls.

A typical living specimen, whom he was enabled to measure through the courtesy

of Dr. Condrau, had an index of 88, which in the skull would be equal to-

about 90. He found a skull which yielded 92, and believes he could easily have
found more extreme examples. Even allowing something for the flattening of the
infant head by its being laid on the back, this is very remarlcable. And the con-
currence of the maximum depth of colour (usually \evy dark grey or light brown

eyes with very dark brown, seldom coal-black, hair) seems to indicate clearly

what was the coloiu- of the aboriginal Rhiietian race.

    3. ' Krao,' the so-called, Missing Linlc. By J. Park Haeeison, M.A.

     The conviction that the hairj' child lately exhibited at the Aquarium in
"Westminster possessed ape-like peculiarities, which she had inherited from wild
parents in some remote forest in Laos, appeared to be so widely entertained that

the author thought it well to bring the subject before the Anthropological Depart-
ment. Unfortunately an admirable description of the case by Dr. Garson, which
appeared in the ' British Medical Journal ' on July 6, 1883, was not copied into
any of the daily journals or scientific periodicals, and so met the eye of only a
limited class of readers. It showed that there was nothing abnormal in Krao,.
except the excessive hairiness ; and this, from a recent letter from Siam, where it

appears the child was born of slave parents, was not inherited /rom them, since they
are said to exhibit no similar development of hair.

                      THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 20.

The President delivered the following Address :

Mt predecessor, Sir Richard Temple, selected for the subject of his address to this

section last year ' The Central Plateau of Asia,' and he treated it not only from

a broad and general geographical, but also, and to some extent, a political and

historical point of view. Following him, in a measure, over some of the same

ground, I have selected the mountain region south of the Central Asian highlands

viz., the Himalayas, and more particularly the western portion of that I'ange, as the

subject of this paper. I propose considering this mountain chain with reference to

its physical features, past and present ; and consequently with reference to its

-geological history, so far as that relates to later tertiary times i.e. the period

immediately preceding the present distribution of seas, land, rivers, and lakes. It

is not, however, my intention to enter very deeply into the purely geological branch

of the subject.

     Comparatively little of the earth's surface now remains unexplored, but much

remains to be surveyed and examined in a more scientific manner. Within the
last fifty years explorers have made known to us the general features of those

dotted or blank spaces which, as boys, we used to look at in our school atlas

sheets with so much curiosity, mingled with no little desire to discover the hidden
secrets of the unknown lands so shown. The student of the present day enjoys

information more or less accurate respecting countries which to us were mere

speculative shadows.

But there are other atlas sheets beneath, and only a very few feet beneath, those

of this present day, which are closely connected with the latter, and beneath them

again others lie still deeper which have modified the geography of this earth over

and over again. It is to such a sheet or two relating to the great Himalayan chain
that I now invite your attention. If we wish to deal with physical geography

(and to my mind it has equal charms with either pure geography or exploration)

·our inquiry must, if we wish it to be of any really scientific value, be based on

geological structure. AVe must study the ancient atlas sheets, one by one, which

nature is, day by day, revealing to us by the denudation of the present surface, taking

away and building up the material for atlas sheets of future epochs. Geography

and geology are very intimately related; each is truly based upon the other. Local

changes of temperature on tlie surface of this earth, and internally the slow shrinking

of its crust, have eft'ected gigantic changes of its surface, and are still altering the

topographical features of every country. Directly we look back in time and space

and note what changes have taken place, the science of geology steps iu, and with
Ait mathematics, chemistry, botany, and zoology.
                                                  raised sea-beach with its dead

shells, or a submerged forest with the remains of its former fauna and flora,

geologically an event of yesterday, sends us back thousands of years into the past,

thinking of what were the aspect and dimensions of the former land ; therefore,

to be a good geographer, something should be known of geology and its kindred

sciences. This will be my excuse if in this address I dip somewhat below the
surface, and, as some may think, introduce too much geology into this section. The

basis, however, of this branch of knowledge is geography, and this the Royal

Geographical Society and the British Association in this particular section do

all they can to foster. There is no gainsaying tlie fact that very many of our ablest
men of science, the ablest naturalists and geologists this country has produced (and

it has taken a leading part in geology), have commenced their careers in con-

nection with geographical exploration. Darwin's earlier studies were prosecuted

whilst he was attached to  marine   surveys in                             other  parts of the world                                                                      through the
                                                                                                                                                                       ;

same school passed Huxley and Edward Forbes. There was no better example of an
able geographer and geologist than Sir Roderick Murchison, who for years took a

leadmg part at these meetings. The list might be largely extended--Sir Joseph

Hooker, Wallace, ^\>ville Thomson, Moseley, &c. That most seductive of all

studies, the geographical distribution of species, is intimately connected with

geographical exploration. Just as the navy owes much of its efficiency to our

coasting and mercantile marine and to our hardy fishermen, so have geography and

other sciences been strengthened by the labours of those practical and sci'entific men
who have been engaged in marine or territorial surveys.

     The Himalayas, the highest mountains in the world, have excited the interest of
many travellers and many geographers; very much has been written about them,
some from personal knowledge, and a good deal on second-hand information. Much

confusion has residted from the features of the north-western area beino- so

dissimilar in composition to those of the rest, or eastern part, of the chain, and the

limitation placed on the breadth and extent of the whole as a mountain mass.
There has been a tendency to apply the term ' Himalaya ' in too extended a sense :'

it should, I consider, be restricted to those portions which dominate the plains

of India, from the inhabitants of which country we have derived the name. This

would, strictly speaking, apply only to the snowy range seen from the plains of India

bordering upon the course  of  the  Ganges                                 but  we might, I think, use                                                                    the term in
                                                                        ;

an extended sense, so as to include, that which we may call the north-western

Himalaya, north of the Panjab, and also the eastern Himalaya, bordering on Assam.
     The orography of this mountain mass has been recently ably handled by Messrs.

Medhcott and Blanford,i and I follow them in all their main divisions and

nomenclature, wliich are based upon a thorough understanding of the rocks of the
country. Some line must be selected where the term Himalaya in its widest sense
must cease to be used, and this certainlv cannot be better defined than by the

valley of the Indus from Attock to Bunji. On this line we find the great bending

round or change in the strike of all the ranges. Strictly speaking, the change
commences on the south, where the Jhelum River leaves 'the mountains, but this

line, north of Mozufferabad, continues on into the above-mentioned part of the
Indus va,lley. To the mountains north of the Indus on its east and west course the

name Himalaya should certainly never be applied. For this north-west Trans-

Indus part of the Asian chain we have the well-known name Mustagh, so far as
the head of the Gilgit valley ; the Hindu Kush being an excellent term now in
common use for its extension to the Afghan country.

The observations made by many of the assistants of the Indian Geological

mSurvey, more especially by Stoliczka, and more recently by Lydekker ^ the

Himalayas, combined with those made by myself in the same region, have, when
considered in conjunction with the ascertained strike of the granitoid or gneissic
rocks, led me to separate the great Central Asian

     I use the word ' cliam ' in its widest meaning, so as to comprise the whole
length and breadth of a mountain mass, and not, as it has been sometimes used, to

describe a ' chain ' or single line of mountain peaks.
     I show these and the equivalent ranges of other geographers and authors in

the accompanying synoptical form ; and if sections be made, at intervals of about
100 miles apart, through the whole mass of the chain from the plains of India to

Thibet, they show where the different ranges are locally represented, and how they
separate or are given off from the main axis lines. The same scale for both

vertical and horizontal measurements should be used, because there is nothing more

misleading than sections in which an exaggerated vertical scale is used. In our

present state of ignorance as to the composition of the chain eastward froni the

source of the Sutlej, we cannot attempt to lay down there any axis lines of original
elevation. The separation by Mr. Clements Markham ' and Mr. Trelawney Saunders ^

of the line of highest peaks into one range, and the water-parting into another, is

an acceptable solution of the physical features as at present known of this part of
the chain. I am led to think, however, that when this ground is examined it will

resolve itself into a series of parallel ridges more or less close, and oblique to the

line of greatest altitude as defined by the line of high peaks, crossing diagonally
even the main drainage line of the Tsang-po,^ just as we see the Ladak axis crossing
the Indus near Hanle, or the Pir Panjal that "of the Jhelum. Sir Henry Strachey's

conception of the general structure was the soundest and most scientific first pro-

pounded.* He considered it to be made up of a series of parallel ranges running

in an oblique line to the general direction of the whole mass, the great peaks being
on terminal butt-ends of the successive parallel ranges, the watershed following the
lowest parts of the ridges, and the drainage crossing the highest, in deep gorges

directly transverse to the main lines of elevation.
     It wUl be seen from sections, drawn as above, that the mountain mass of the

Himalayas increases gradually in height from the south to about its central portion,

and then as gradually falls towards the north side. There is no abrupt and con-
spicuous slope from the higher line of peaks to the plains ; a succession of spurs from

the main waterparting intervenes, and these spurs retain often a very considerable

altitude far to the south. The spurs terminate, usually, abruptly towards the plains
of India, at an altitude of 5,000 to 8,000 feet, just within a more or less broad

belt of fringing low hills, the well-known Sivaliks.

It has been laid down that the Himalayan chain culminates in two parallel

rano'cs running through its entire length from the Indus to the Brahmaputra, and

these have  been  called  the  north and south Himalaya, or central  and  southern
                                                                                                                      ;

the two combined (they are very close in parts) really constitute the above chain.

We can apply this system to certain portions of the range, but it breaks down

when we reach the Sutlej on one side and the Monass on the other. The more

we increase the scale of our maps, the greater the number of axial lines we can

establish, all intimately connected with, and subsidiary to, the run or strike of

the greater series of axial elevations.

NowStoliczka records it ^ with slates and scliists resting on it to the southward.

the nest great granitoid axis south of the above, with palseozoic rocks on its
northern face, is at the Mustasfh pass, fifty miles to the south of the Kuenlun
at Zangi-diwan, and it coincides in position with the prneiss of Kila Panza,'-'

the granitic axis of the Mustagli being continued W.N.W. in the high peaks of

Hunza-Nagar. The Kuenlun axis passes by Shahdula eastward by peaks E. 61,
23,890, E. 64, 21,500, up to Yeshil-Kul on the Keria route, for a distance of about
450 miles ; beyond this is unexplored country.

     I have adopted the term Mustagh as one well known to the people on both sides
of the range, and better known than Karakoram, applied by them to the pass
of that name. The Karakoram pass also lies on an axis of elevation further to the

--north and intermediate between the Mustagh and Kuenlun.
     2. Mustar/h. This axis, as I have shown above, commences near Kila Panza
in Wakhau, thence by the Baroghil and Kerambar passes to the great peaks
dominating the Hunza valley to the Mustagh pass, eastward by K., 28,250, to the
great peaks north of the Shayok, Kg, Kjg, K,j, Kj.,,^ the Sassar pass, and thence S.E.
on to the Marse Mik La and the high mass north of the Pangkong Lake, crossing

at Nyak Tso on to the high range south of the Rudok plain, where we again enter

 unsurveyed ground. It is probably continuous to the Aling Gangri, the old
 original drainage of the Shayok passing through it at the Pangkong Lake, thus

 repeating in a similar way that of the Lidus through the Ladak range near
 Ilanli?. This most remarkable depression of the whole area, the Rudok plain, lies
 S.E. of the Pangkong Lake, where, on the same meridian as the sources of the
 Lidus and Tsang-po, we have a plain only a little above 14,000 feet, which once

 drained in glacial and preglacial times into the Shayoli, rendering that branch

 as long, probably longer than the present Indus. From a high point above the
 Pangkong I have looked over this plain ; for a distance of some sixty miles it was

 seen bomided to the south 'by mountains of over 21,000 feet, and no mountain
 ranges broke the horizon. The depression is a broad and continuous one here, lower
 and more extensive than that at the head of the Indus. It is not improbable that
  it indicates the head waters of the next great drainage area north of the Indus,
 viz., of the rivers that find an exit to the sea through Burmah. The Gang-rhi and
 Karakoram, or jNIustagh, cannot be therefore considered as one range separating the
 Indus basin from that of the northern or central plateau of Thibet. This must lie
 across the broad elevated plateau that extends from the Karakoram pass, having
 a general parallelism to the Kuenlun certainly so far as 34° N. and L. 82° E.

       The crystalline limestone near the west end of the Pangkong Lake would appear
 to be the same as the similar limestone at Shigar near Scardo. It comes in, too,
 on the north side of the great gneissic axis, the northern boundary of which follows
 the Shayok River pretty closely from Tankse and Shayok to KhapaUi. The foldings
  in the gneiss which have caught up the palteozoic slates near Tankse are again on
  the west indicated by the metamorphic schists on the Indus south of Kartaksho,
  and by those in the section S.W. of Scardo.

    --2N. Karakoram-Limizi Tlumg Range. AVest of the pass the country is not

  known. Eastward the line of elevation passes north of the Dipsang plain to the

  Compass La, and south of the Lingzi Thang plain, by the Changlung Burma La to
  the neighbourhood of the Kiang La, and thence still further east it may pass north

 --of Sarthol into Garchethol.
       3. The Ladah-Gurln Range. This is the best defined, as a continuous granitoid

 lines ; the result of the original elevation, and subsequent denudation. In a strictly
  geographical sense these must be indicated-- especially where they have any consider-

 --able extension, or become a noticeable feature of the country as, for instance, the

  relative position of the Baralasa ridge to the Zaskar, a portion of the main Hima-

   laya.

axis, on the east and west of Leb ; the Indus flows at the base of its escarpment for

190 miles, and this line also was not far from the limit of the ancient nimimulitic

sea. On the west it unites with the o^reat plateau of Deosai and extends to Gilgit.

The Indus drainage has cut through it from south to north into the Scardo basin,

and back again to south at the sharp bend at Bunji, while on the east at Haul6 the

same river passes to the north again, and the range is continued following the

left or south bank up to the Gurla peak, south of the Mansarowar Lake. Thence it

is probably continuous up to the Fotu La.

  --2S. The Shaijok-Kailas. This subsidiary axis is weU marked on the south of the

Pangkong Lake N.W. and S.E. of Tankse, running parallel to the Ladak range.

It is then to be followed westward, north of the Shayok River to the junction of

the Basha Braldoh Rivers, and thence to liaramosh and Raki Pushi peaks, and

perhaps through Yasin to Tirich Mir on the Hindu Kush. To the eastward from

Sajam peak, the north side of the Indus and Gartangchu to the Kailas peak,

thence very probably north of the head waters of the Brahmaputra.

   --4. The Zaskar Range. Where best displayed, it is that portion which lies

south of the districts of that name in Ladak, and runs parallel for 100 miles with

the upper sources of that large tributary of the Indus, the river of the same name.

In the size of the present glaciers, that fill the upper valleys, this portion more closely

resembles the Alps of Europe than any other part of the Himalayan chain. It is

continued to the N.W., past Dras, to the southern side of the Deosai plains, thus

coalescing with that great elevated mass of the primitive rocks. It is continued to

the Nanga Purbet, 26,620 feet, and it probably continues stiU further, west of the

Indus, the curve of the range bounding Swat and Bajaur on the north towards

Kunar, and which, after the central portion, we may term j at present, the Bajaur range.

Taking it up in a S.E. direction, it bends slightly south, crossing the head of the

Bagha River by the Rotang pass to that line of lofty snowy peaks seen from Simla

and other hill stations leading past Chini to the east of the Sutlej, to the famous

peaks of Gangotri, Nandadevi, and Nampa. To the majority of Europeans who

--have visited India this is perhaps the best known portion of the Himalayas.
   4N'. The Rukshu Ridge. Two secondary ranges, more or less connected with

the last, one iutimately so with an axis of trappsean intrusion of , early tertiary

age, which from Dras to the Mansarawa is over 400 miles in extent, can be followed.

The first is conspicuous at the TsomorLrhi Lake, Mata Peak, 20,600 feet, being of

granitic rock ; it is seen on the west covered by the earlier sedimentary formations,

but it can be traced towards Dras, and on the S.E. to the Imis La, cur^dng thence

towards the Leo Purgial mass, the elevated tertiary formations of Hundea coming

in on the east.

  --4N". The Stok. Another subsidiary and later line of elevation, one I had at first

been inclined to disregard in this address, being a minor feature in comparison with

the whole chain, flanks conspicuously (attaining the very considerable elevation of

over 20,000 feet) the left bank of the Indus for 200 miles, and is still more intimately

related to the above trappsean intrusion. It forms a connecting link with the

tertiary rocks of the same age on the southern base of the Himalayas (the eleva-

tion of which led on successively to the formation of the outermost range of hUls,

the Sivaliks), and shows the relatively recent date of the elevation of the whole

chain, and the obliteration of the topographical details of a previous mountain

mass.

  --4N. The Baralacha Ridge. This line corresponds with the run of the

highly tilted slates, carboniferous and succeeding formations, resting against the

Zaskar axis, which it follows from near Suru to south of Padam by the Baralacha

and  Parang  passes                                 here,  for a short  distance  constituting the  water-parting  be-
                                                 ;

tween the Indus and Chandrabagha, it can be traced towards the Sutlej, Chini,

crossing on to the Keobrang, and in turn the Nilang, Niti, Lakhur, and Tinkar

Xiasses, displaying all along this line its characteristic feature, first seen at the

Baralacha pass, of being the main waterparting between the Ganges and Kali

basins on the south, and the Indus on the north, and constituting from here to the

eastward, with the peaks on the granitic or gneissose axis, the main Himalayan

range. In the Nipal area to the eastward, we notice the great similarity with
582 EEroiiT-- 1883.

which one river basin follows the other, the only dilierence being that the water-

Wesheds of some lie further to the north than others.  may thus, 1 think, infer that

the above character of the Baralacha axis is the type of the physical features along

--this unsurveyed, little-known territory, until we reach the longitude of Daijiliug.
     4s. The Chenab and North Kashmir. South of the Cheuab River, running: parallel

with it for many miles, is another gneissic axis, through which the Chenab passes

into a sharp bend to the south near Kishtwar ; the peak of Gwalga well marks its

position here, and the strike of the same rock is continued towards the northern

outer hills of the Kashmir valley by Barrapalta and Dalwas Peak, near the Hoksar

pass, and the Maro Wardwau valley below Ainshin. For some distance the stratified

rocks only are seen, but on the Boodpathar ridge near Srinagar and in the Sind

valley, and again from near Haramook Peak to Tragbul, the gneissic rocks appear.

Further still they occur in the hills at the head of the large tributaries of the

Kahmil River, and thence I suspect are continued across the Kishengunga to tlie

Snowy Peaks above Wamba and into K-hagan. On the S.E. at the Rotang pass at

the head of the Beas vallej' it unites with the Zaskar axis.

  --5. The Fir Pamjal-Dhaoladhar Ridge. On the outer face of the chain there is a

well-marked gneissic or granitoid axis of elevation. It is well exempliiied on the

Dhaoladhar ridge above Dharmsala, directly connected with, and equally well dis-

played in, the Chatadhar ridge south of Budrawar ; thence it can be traced to the

Chenab, which breaks through it here, to the south-east side of the Kashmir vallej-,

Weforming the eastern end of the Pir Panjal range.  find it at intervals amidst the

older slates along the ridge westward, and close up to the gorge of the Jhelum River,

where it leaves the valley of Kashmir. It reappears on the other side of the Jhelum

in the Kajnag ridge towards Mozuflerabad. The gorges of the Kishengunga and

Khagan Rivers are near this place, and to the westward the granitoid rocks are again

met with at Manserah in the Ilazara valley. Little is known of the mountains to tlie

north of this, but the axis apparently crosses the Indus near Amb, curving round

in the Yusufzai Hills north of the Peshawar valley, the Sufedkoh being an anahigous

range on the south of the Kabul River. Returning to the Dhaoladhar ridge,

the granitoid axis continues to Sultanpur on the P>eas across that river, by .Suket

to Hatn, across the Sutlej to Kuper and Kanehu Peaks, and the well-known peak

of the Chor. Nag Tiba, north of ilnssoorie, would mark its eastern extension,

beneath the slates of that ridge, and beyond Dudatcli and Binsar Peaks, and

Almora to the Kali River,' near Meenda Ghur. This axis thus holds the same

position with regard to the plains of India and at about the same distance from

their base for a very great distance.

  --6. The Sub- Himalaya. This longitudinal section of the Himalaya is easily

defined by the fringing line of hills more or less broad, and in places very distinctly

marked off from the main chain by open valleys (dhuns), or narrow valleys parallel

with the main axis of the chain.

   --The Eastern Himalaya. In Western Bhutan, beyond Darjiling, between the
AmJuldoka and the
                   Mochu, the gneissic rocks have a N.W. strike by the Pangn

La, apparently towards Kanchinjunga ; to the S.E. by Betso Peak to the Singchula

above Buxa. Hooker records Kinchinjhow as of granite, with stratified rocks to

the north. This axis may possibly be continued E.S.E. to Chumularhi and the

gneiss of the mountains north of Paro.

In the far east, in the Bafla Hills, a more general parallelism of the ranges

Afrom W. to E. io found, assimilating to tlie N.W. area.  well-marked granitoid

axis is to be traced from S.W. to N.E. (the outer Himalaya here), convex to

the S.E., the tertiaries or the Sub-Himalaya being of considerable breadth and

elevation, and following the same curve. Considerable valleys or dhuns are also

again a feature on this side.

Lastly, there is the Assam range, wliich, although not lorming a part of the

Himalayan mountain system, I must allude to, as I shall have to refer to it further

on. This is very clearly defined by a gneissic axis on its southein margin, against

which the secondary rocks rest, and bj' a more northern line of the same primitive

rock, succeeded by another of isolated low hills following the northern base and
the course of the Brahmaputra, and generally lying to the north of it. The last

outcrop is seen at Dhoobri, and thence it is no doubt continuous across the delta
to similar outcrops of Bengal gneiss on the Ganges, thus connecting this axis of
elevation with that of peninsular India. The above range is convex to the south,

curving up to the N.E. in the Lhota Naga and Nowgong Hills, and to the
W.N.W. in the Garo Hills.

     The Burrail range forms another subsidiary line of elevation to the above from
the Naga Hills to Jaintiapur, and falls away dipphig under the Sylhet bhils,^ to reap-
pear at the most S.W. point of the Garo Hills. From its highest point in the Naga
Hills (.lapvo), where the strata become nearly horizontal, it merges into and throws

off the high N. and S. ridges that bound the Slunipur valley on the west, to join the
Lushai Ilills on the south. This I would call the Western Munipiu- and Arakan
range. It has no granitoid axis ; but to the N.E. of Munipur a great mass of
intrusive rock occurs at the high peak of Shuruifurar, and thence a high line of

elevation runs N.N.E. to Saramethi Peak, and to the south forms the eastern boun-

dary of the Munipur valley, and might be called the eastern Munipur range. It

is the water-parting between the above valley and that of the Kyangdweng.

   We can, in a measure, exemplify the structure of the Himalaya by that of the

bones of the right hand, with fingers much elongated and stretched wide apart, of
which the wrist and back may represent the broader belt of granitic rocks of the

eastern area, the thumb and fingers the more or less continuous ridges of the N.W.,,
some less prolonged than others to the north-west, such as the Chor axis, which may

be represented by the thumb, terminating on the southern margin near the Sutlej.

The left hand placed opposite will represent the same features to the west of the

WeIndus.  will even carry this simile further, and as a rough illustration suppose

the intervals or long basins between the fingers to be filled with sedimentary

deposits, and the fingers then to be brought closer together, producing a crushing

and crumpling of the strata. At the same time an elevation or depression, first of

one or more of the fingers, then of another or of the whole hand has taken place, and

you are presented with very much what has gone on upon a grand scale over this

vast area. As these changes of level have not taken place along the whole range

W.from E. to  in an equal extent, but upon certain transverse or diagonal lines,

midulations more or less great have been the result, and some formations have at-

tained a higher position in some places than in others, producing, very early in the
history of these mountains, a transverse system of drainage lines, leading through

the long axial ridges.

     The last efforts of these rising, sinking, and lateral crushing, and, as I believe,,
very slowly acting forces, are to be seen at the southern face of these mountains in
the tertiaiy strata that make up the Sub-Himalayan axis (Sivalik), a topographical
feature which is most striking by reason of its persistence and uniformity for some
1,600 miles ; for, although a similar and synchronous elevation of the Alps has taken
place, the same regularity of orographical features has not been the result, most

probably from the difference in the original outline of deposition in the latter area.
One object in this address will be to endeavour to point out and compare some of
the physical features of the two great European and Asiatic chains.

    From Assam on the east to the Panjabonthe west, bending round and extend-

ing to Scinde, this fringing line of parallel ridges is found at the base of the

Himalayas, sometimes higher, sometimes wider, often forming elliptical valleys.

Only in one part of the belt east of the Teesta are they absent altogether, and

for a distance of fifty miles the metamorphic rocks rise directly from the plains

--of India,^ a feature representing a great break the correct interpretation of which

will tell us very much of the past history of these mountains. These formations

are of vast thickness, and iuthePanjab, where they attain their greatest width and

elevation between the Chenab and the Indus, cover an area of 13,000 square

miles.                                            Memoirs of the Geological Society of

     The Avbole of this material has been derived from the adjacent Himalayas,
representing many feet of the older and higher mountain ranges, and has travelled
down valleys that had been excavated in pre-tertiary times. This points to a slow

subsidence of the whole southern side of the mountain mass, deposition generally

keeping pace with it, broken oft' by recurring long intervals of re-elevation. Such

important, well-marked features as these cannot be omitted when treating of a

mountain  system. Many                             long  and  instructive  pages  of its  history  are  written
                                                _

on these rocks, with the help of which we may reconsti-uct some of the outUnes

of its more ancient geography.

The next most interesting feature connected with the former distribution of

xand and sea is that these Sub-Himalayan formations are fresh-water, or torrential,
showing that since uummulitic or eocene times the sea has never washed the base

of the Himalayas.' In fact, there is no evidence of this from the gorge where the

Ganges leaves the mountains up to the base of the Garo Hills pointuig to an ex-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

tension northward at that early age of the Arabian Sea, separated from the Bay

of Bengal by peninsular India. I am led also to believe that from Assam to

Scinde there once existed one continuous drainage line, a e:reat river receiving its

tributaries from the Himalayas, partly a land of lakes and marshes, the home of

that wonderful mammalian and reptilian fauna which Oautley and Falconer were

the first to bring to light. In pliocene times, before the greater displacements

commenced, it is not unlikely that the Kashmir basin drained at the north-west
end into the Kishingunga Valley to Mozufterabad, and that of Huudes and Ladak

trended towards the same direction via Dras.

The southern boundary of this long alluvial plain was formed by the present

peninsula of India, and probably of the extension of the Garo and" Khasi Hills
westward to the Rajmahal hills.- Depression has been considerable in the neigh-

bourhood of Calcutta,^ nearly 500 feet. AVe know probably only a portion of the
alluvial deposits. At 380 feet beds of peat were passed through in bormg, and

the lowest beds contained fresh-water shells ; the beds also were of such a gravelly

nature as to indicate the neighbourhood of hills, now buried beneath the Ganges

alluvium. This is precisely the appearance of the country above Calcutta on

approaching the present valley of the Brahmaputra. The western termination of
the Garo Hills sinks into these later alluvial deposits, and along the southern face

of the range up to Sylhet, the waters of the marshes * during the rainy season wash

the uummulitic rocks like an inland sea, and point to the very recent depression of all

this area. The isolated granite hill-tops jutting up out of the marshy country from

Dhoobri to Gwalpara and on to Tezpur all testify to the same continuous depres-

sion here. It is exactly north of this that we"^fiud the Sivalik formations absent

at the base of the Himalayas, and we have the evidence of exclusively marine

Weconditions in plioceue times at the base of the Garo Hills.*                            find also a large

development of marine beds above the uummulitic limestone in the Jaintia coun-

try," passing up conformably into a great thickness of upper miocene sandstones of

the Burrail range. In such sandstone north of the Munipur valley the only fossils I
found were marine forms.

This gradual depression of the delta of the Ganges, the relative higher level of

the water-parting and shifting of the Panjab rivers westward, appear to be only the

last phase of that post-pliocene disturbance which broke up the Assam Sub-
Himalayan lacustrine system draining into the Arabian Sea. Zoological e-\-idence
which I cannot here find space to quote is also in favour of this former connection
of the now separated waters of the Ganges and Indus basins, and the hill tracts of

the Garo and Khasi llilh; with peninsular India.

     The ground where the miocene rocks are absent is not where any denuding
force from the north could have acted with any abnormal intensity. It lies under

the hills where no great tributary enters the plain, and might have removed the

above formation. All the evidence is in favour of the axis line of depression in the

Ganges delta between Rajmahal and the Garo Hills extending thus far, and that

the miocene beds, once continuous, are here thus lost to sight beneath the more

recent yet extensive gravels and conglomerates that here occur, and have par-

taken also of a last slight elevation of the mountain chain.

    Even if we were to raise the rocks below the delta up to the maximum level

of the Garo Hills, about 4,000 feet, it would not be a greater alteration of level than

we can see now a verj- few miles distant to the east. The base of the cretaceous

formation  rests on granite  at  the peak of Kailas, about 3,000 feet  above the  sea                       at
                                                                                                         ;

thirty miles eastward it is at the level of the plains of Sylhet, scarcely removed

above that level; it is here we find a remarkable depression right across the Assam

range from north to south, which it is curious to note faces immediately the Monass

valley of the Bhutan Himalaya.

Great lateral rolls or waves of the stratified rocks occur at intervals all along tbe

southern line of the chain, and apparently have a connection with the transverse

drainage lines. This feature is best seen if we follow tbe older miocene along its

junction with the older rocks. The miocene attains its greatest elevation at Bisari

-- --and Keeran Peaks 11,200 feet close to the end of the Pir Panjal axis: it falls

thence towards Mari to 7,000 feet, and much lower towards the Potwar. Eastwards
it is reduced, above Poonch, to 9,900 feet ; near Rajaurie to 7,000 feet, and Kamrot

--G,700 feet or a fall of 4,500 feet in lifty miles. The elevation increases again,

upon the Chenab, to 8,000 and 9,500 feet ; and, facing the Chatadhar ridge, it is

--again of great elevation 9,096 feet at Hato Pe.ak, and Mandbar 8,932 feet. At

the Ravi, by Basaoli, there is a depression, east of that river, to 4,600 feet, but

it gradually rises again to 6,100 feet at Dhiu-umsala, under the Dhaoladhar ridge,

and retains that altitude to the Beas and Sutlej, where it falls again to 4,000

feet, which is its altitude about Nahun and the Jumna. In the Deyra Dhun it

is only 3,000 feet, but east of the Ganges, where there is a local bend in the strike,

it rises again considerably. Beyond this the country has not been visited by me.

In the eastern area, rmder DarjUing, it is of little elevation, but rises to about

4,000 feet, disappearing altogether near Dalingkote, but near Buxa the forma-

tion reappears, and is only some 2,000 feet. Nothing is known of tbe older ter-
tiarj' rocks up to the Aka and Dafla Hills, but here they attain again large propor-

--tions 4,700 feet west of the Ranga to 6,000 feet beyond that river. South of the

Assam range, miocene strata, a distinct group, attain 1,500 feet, but are poorly

represented in places. At other points, as near tbe Sylhet hhih, they are absent.

Near Jaintiapur they expand and reach an altitude of 3,000 feet. South of the

Lukah River the whole mass gradually rises to 5,000 feet near Asalu, and to

9,890 at Japvo Peak, its culminating point in tbe Naga Hills ; but these formations

are, I believe, marine and estuarine. The great elevation of tertiary rocks here is

the exact counterpart of what has taken place on the west, and both are on the

great changes of strike in all the formations.

   --Within the mountains in the old rock basins and these are analogous to the
--valleys of the Alps are pliocene and post-pliocene beds of great thickness, but

of fresh-water origin ; the remnants of which are to be seen in Kashmir and

--Scardo at intervals, along the valley of the Indus, and that large now elevated
--accumulation at the head of the Sutlej River in Hundes, first brought to

notice by the labours of Captain (now General) R. Strachey. The remnants of

these deposits in Kashmir and Scardo are found preserved in the more sheltered

--portions of the valley basins, untouched by the denuding action during the glacial

period the exponents presented to us of the enormous denudation that went on

during the post -pliocene times, of which the glacial period formed a part. The

extent and displocement of the upper pliocene beds is in North Italy and here

very similar. Often abutting horizontally against the mountains, they are iu

other places found tilted at considerable angles on the margin of their original

extension. When we examine their contents, we find that the fauna of that time

in Asia, as well as Europe, was more African in character, and genera now confined

to that continent were abundant far to the north. The sluggish rivers and lakes

of Sivalik times in Asia and of the corresponding period in Europe were the home

AAlps, present to us somewhat similar physical features.                                                                                                          large area of about

the size of the north-west Panjab, once a part of the miocene sea, is occupied by

a remnant of rocks of that age, considerably ele^ated and tilted, but not to such

an extent as those of the Himalayas. Near Turin these dip towards the mountains,

and a very short examination shows the undoubted glacial character of some of the

beds                      ^  and,  as the  whole  formation                                                                            is  marine,  their  large  sharply  angular  material,
                       ;

much of which is Jurassic limestone, was probably transported "from the adjacent

mountains by the agency of ice in a shallow sea.- After the great crushing and

alteration of the previous outlines of the whole country another sea filled the basin

of the Po, and pliocene deposits were laid down in a sinking area extending to the

base of the mountains all round the new bay or gulf. Ile-elevation again set in,

and with it, or soon after it, the advent of another, and the last, glacial period.
But the bounds of the pliocene sea extended even farther than the base of the

mountains. At the south end of the Lago d'Orta, well within the hills, sheltering

under the isolated porphyry hill of Buccione, and 280 feet above the present lake

(or 1,500 feet above the sea), I had the good fortune to discover this summer a

patch of pliocene sands and clays, with marine shells in excellent preservation,

which I am not aware has been noticed before. Sixty-four feet of the section is

exposed, capped by moraine matter; its base was not seen, and the beds dip north.

This remnant tells us a good deal. From where it rests there is a clear horizon to

--the north down the lake to the junction of its river with the Toce lunnistakable

evidence that these beds must have extended far in this northern direction, and

that long fiord-like arms of the sea stretched up as far as Domo d'Ossola on one

side, and Bellinzona on the other. This marine bed is far above the level of the

Lago Maggiore, but I may mention that I also found marine shells of pleistocene

age 112 feet above that lake near Arona, of which details cannot here be given.

Before the last great elevation of the Alpine chain the old line of sea-coast,

therefore, ran even high up the long deep valleys of ^laggiore, Como, Garda, &c.,

during the early pliocene period                                                                                                       the mountains then, quite  as high  as now, enjoy-
                                                                                                                                    ;

ing a warm, moist climate, not a glacial one. Then came the gradual but uneven

elevation of the whole area, including the miiocene hills south of the Po, and lacus-

trine and estuary conditions prevailed over much of the plain country. The lapse

of time was probably enormous, and as the land rose and the sea retu-ed the climate

gradually became cooler, and ushered in the glacial period. I do not think it would

be an exaggeration to add another 5,000 feet to the Alpine peaks of that time,

which would give them an altitude equal to the Zaskar range of the N.W. Hima-

layas of the present day. With the change and the increased volume of the mountain

torrents, the destruction of the upraised marine pliocene beds commenced, and finally

culminated in the extreme extension of the glaciers, even into the plains ; thej^

scoured out almost completely the whole of these deposits, which then filled the

great valleys and the country at the base of the mountains, to redistribute them

again over the plain of the Po, and silt up what remained there of the old estuary

    - No trace has been observed of this glacial period in the miocene of India ; the

most lofty portions of the chain had not then attained a greater elevation probably
than 14,000 to 18,000 feet, and the outer axis lines far less. However, in the tertiarj'

beds (middle Eocene ?) of the Indus Valley below Leh, such conditions are indicated

or gulf towards the east. The denudation of this formation has heen enormous
along the base of the Alps, and only mere remnants are to be found. It is easily
seen that their preservation is purely due to the accidental position in places where

-- --the great denuding force viz., the advance of ice from the mountains has been

unable to touch them ; in other instances the early deposition of moraine matter
upon them has acted like a shield, and prevented their entire destruction. Such
examples are well seen near Ivrea, in the well-known section in the gorge of the
Chieusella near Stombinella, and in the moraine near San Giovanni.

     The scattered remnants of the pliocene formation south of the Alps, which took

perhaps thousands of years to lay down, show well how soon a great formation,
together with the preserved remains of the fauna living at the time, may be

completely destroyed by subsequent denuding forces. Similar destruction must have

occurred over and over again in past geological ages, and shows clearly how the

scanty, broken record can be accounted for.

     It is an established fact that the great valleys of the Alps and Himalayas existed

much in their present form during miocene times, and they may owe their exca-
vation partly to the glacial action of that period, when these moimtain slopes rose

from the plain or margin of the ancient sea, far in front of the present line of slope,

and were far higher than now. This idea particularly strikes one when looking
at the ice ground spurs that run out into the plain south of the Lago d'Orta. The

general and local elevation and depression that took place in post-miocene times
seem quite sufKcient to account for the difi'erence in the comparative levels of
adjacent transverse valleys, or an elevation along the base of the chain, clearly

indicated at Orta by the noi'therly dip of the marme beds. It is reasonable to
suppose that these movements were exerted in ditl'erent degrees, at points all along

this face of the Alps and within the same, and that the depression on the west has
been less than on the east, so that the sea neAer extended far up the valley of Susa,
and to a comparatively short distance up that of the Dora Baltea as compared with
Maggiore, and the formation and excessive depth of this and similar lakes on the
east is mainly due to this local depression and elevation. Depression has steadily
continued in the delta of the Po, as in the Ganges at Calcutta ; for, at Venice, borings

showed depression of land surface to an extent of 400 feet, and they did not reach

the base of the formation.'

      It is not improbable that during the earlier extension of the glaciers into the
Maggiore basin,- the sea still had access to it ; ^ this would have greatly aided in the
removal of the marine deposits, and then the deeper erosion of its bed near the

Borromean Islands, so well put forward by Sir Andrew Ramsay. When we see

the gigantic scouring which glaciers have eii'ected in the hardest rocks on the sides

and bottoms of valleys, when we know for certain the enormous thickness they
reached in the Alps, I do not doubt for a moment their capability of deepening a
rock basin very considerably, or their power to move forward over and against

slopes so low as 2° to 3°.*

    The earliest extreme extension of the glaciers was very great ; we have evidence

of it on the miocene hills near Turin, their suiface being scattered over with trans-

ported material of great size, quite unconnected with that other ancient period of
glacial conditions during the miocene times mentioned above at a period too

remote to further dwell upon here. Even now I feel that in dealing with this
subject of the glaciation of the Alps, many of you may say that I am departing too
much from geography. To tliis I would answer, glacial periods have been so inti-

mately connected with the interchange of sea and land conditions, that where can

tlie line be diawn in physical geographj- between the past and the present ? It is

as u.ndefined as the line which separates species from genera.

    An enormous interval of time must have elapsed, during which the cold was

increasing and the glaciers advancing, and during which the rivers were dis-

tributing the consequent waste over the lower country, spreading out the more or

less coarse material, sands and clays, in broad fans in front of all the great gorges.

Then came the first period of contraction of the glaciers, with many oscillations. Of

this we have the evidence in the moraines of Ivrea, ISIaggiore, &c. Sections of

these moraines  show how  they   were       piled the  one  upon the  other how                          the
                                                                                                      ;

building up of one line of lateral moraine was followed by its partial destruction on

another forward movement of the ice, and the throwing down of another moraine
upon it. Then were formed many of the smaller lakes, remains of which lie amid

the debris thrown out into the plain. The glaciers retained this size for a very con-

siderable time, and then apparently very rapidly retreated to far within the moun-

tains, but still for another considerable period their dimensions were much larger

than those of the present time, into which they seem to have again rather rapidly

shrunk.

     Passing from the glacial action displayed in the outer Alps to that in the

Himalayas, we find ample evidence of a period of great extension of such conditions,

first in the erratics of the Attock plain and the rotwar,^ lying fifty to sixty miles

Wefrom the gorge of the Indus at Torbela.          have again the fact that in Baltistan,

in the Indus valley, glaciers have twice descended far beyond their present limits,

first down to Scardo itself, and then to some thirty miles below their present limits
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

while the glaciers of Nanga Purbet, towering above the Indus some 22,000 I'eet,

must have descended into the bed of that river. Even allowing that the Potwar

was not formerly a lacustrine- ba.sin, the great debacles from the mountains would

have been sufficient to convey erratics fixed in ice to where they now lie. Cata-

clysms of the present time, caused by glacial obstructions, have raised the level of

the Indus on the plain above Attock so much as eighty feet. When these glaciers

were more than double their present size, gigantic floods must have often taken

place, and formed boulder deposits high above present levels : such high level gravels

are to be seen not only in the Potwar, but also in the Naoshera Dhun on the

Rajaurie Tawi River, containing boulders of nummulitic limestone and other rocks

of the Pir Puujal on the north.

Again, north of the Chatadliar ridge, small glaciers, five to six miles in length,

at one time filled the lateral valleys, descending towards the Chenab River to about

5,000 feet ; and a very perfect moraine occurs in one valley. This ground must be

very similar to that which has been described by Theobald as occurring in the

adjacent Kangra district^ on the flanks of the IJhaoladhar ridge. Similar small

glaciers existed, I believe, in the valleys of the Kajnag range, but I think that

neither in this range nor in Budrawa did they ever descend into the main valleys

but the existence of these glaciers, together with the large snow-beds, had much to

do with the formation of the high-level gravel-beds and fans through which the

Jhelum and Chenab have since cut their way.

In fact, examples of the former extension of glaciers are wide-spread along the

chain of the Ilimalaj-as from west to east. True moraines, and moraine-mounds, at

16,000 feet on the north side of the Baralasa pass, attest the presence of glaciers

on the elevated plain of Rukshu, where now the snow-line is over 20,000 feet.^

   --Whatever may have been the length of the glacial period in the Alps and it

--was very considerable in the Himalayas it cannot have been so long and so general,

although, to a certain extent, contemporaneous.

     In the Alps glaciation meets the eye on every side, and the mountains, up to a
distinct level, owe their form and outline to its great and universal extension.

     In the Himalayas it is difficult to trace polished surfaces or striae markings, even

in the neighbourhood of the largest glaciers that are now advancing in full activity.
It has been suggested that obliteration is the result of more powerful denudating

forces, but the conditions are not so very dissimilar in the high Alps and high

Himalayas as to warrant this ; and wherever the oldest strice marks occur in the

Himalayas, they are situated near the bed of the ^alley. It may interest vou if I

give an illustration or two of the size of tliese present glaciers as compared with

those of the Alps. The Baltoro glacier would extend, if placed in the Toce valley,

from the Simplon  to the margin of  the  Lago    Maggiore                                                 or,  take another illus-
                                                                                                       ;

tration of its length, from Mont Blanc to Chatillon in the Valle d'Aosta.

Although of such great length, these Himalayan glaciers could never have

reached the enormous thickness which the earlier Alpine glaciers attained. This

may be thus accounted for: in the European area a generally low temperature
prevailed down to the sea-level, while in the Himalayan it was local, and confined

--to a higher level. It is evident that the snow-line has altered higher at one

--period, lower at another down to recent times, denoting changes of the mean

annual temperature, which are not yet fully understood, but have been attributed

to very far distant distribution or alterations of land, sea, and the ocean currents.

    Two periods of glacial extension are clearly defined, separated by a milder

interval of climate : during the earlier glacial period the Indus valley was filled

with those extensive lacustrine and fluviatile deposits, mixed with large angular

debris, such as we see at Scardo, which may be coeval with the extreme extension

of the Alpine erratics so far as tlie miocene hills south of Turin.

The second period followed after a long interval of denudation of the same

beds, and would correspond with the last extension of the great moraines of Ivrea,
Maggiore, Como, &c., followed by a final retreat to nearly present smaller dimen-

sions. Nowhere on the south face of the Himalaya do we find valleys presenting

any features similar to those of the Southern Alps, particularly on the Italian lakes,
which are, I believe, the result in the first place of marine denudation, succeeded

by that of depression and finally powerful ice-action. On the south face of the

Khasi and Jaintia Hills, however, which are orographically connected with the

-- --peninsula of India the conditions altogether difierent we find long stretches of

water of considerable breadth and depth extending within the hills, and not

unlike in miniature the Italian lakes. These valleys, worn out of the sandstone
and limestone rock, have been formed here, I think, to some extent by the aid
of marine action, and the subsequent depression along this line of hills, also marked
here, as in the Western Bhutan Dears, by the absence of beds newer than the

nummulitic.

     This attempt to bring before you some of the great changes in the geography of

Europe and Asia must now be brought to an end. It is a subject of vast time, of
absorbing interest. I am only sorry it is not in more able hands than mine to treat
it in the manner it deserves, and in better and more eloquent language ; but it is a
talent given to but few men (sometimes to a Lyell or a Darwin) to explain clearly

and in an interesting form the great and gradual changes the surface of the earth has

passed through. The study of those changes must create in our minds humble

admiration of the great Creator's sublime work, audit is in such a spirit that I now

submit for your consideration the subject of this address.

     The author commenced hy gi^'ing a description of the hot springs of Iceland

and New Zealand, both of which have been recently \-isited by him. Several

most important differences were noticed in their composition; in the case of the

hot mud wells of Iceland, there is so much copper suspended in the mud that several
Clompanies have been started to work them commercially; while the mud springs

of New Zealand are so full of Infusoria that in times of famine the natives manage
to sustain life on a diet chiefly consisting of mud. Some of the New Zealand

springs contain a very large percentage of mineral, and the analysis of^one of the

most powerful was

Tlie hot springs of New Zealand apjiear to extend from Mount Tongariro, at the

S.W. end of the system, to White Island at the N.E. extremity. On April 25,

Tongariro was observed to be giving out more smoke than since 1870, when a

considerable eruption took phice. The two most remarkable objects in connection

with the New Zealand geysers are the Pink and White terraces, situated on Lake

Rotomahana ; these consist of regular steps, each of which forms a small basin fuU

of the clearest water; in the case of the White terrace the water has a beautiful

sky-blue appearance, while at the Pink terrace the whole is tinged with a delicate

salmon colour. The upper basin in each case is about 80 feet above the level

of Lake Rotomahana. The Avhole of the country round is covered with hot

which would probably be fatal. Several curious Maori customs were mentioned,

                                  2. Notes on the Territori/ of Arizona.

                   By Litton Forbes, M.D., L.E.C.P., F.B.G.S.

     The author, after alluding to the general ignorance as to the ricli territory of
Arizona, pointed out that it was now practically opened up, for the first time

in its history, by the completion, in the last days of May 1883, of the new Atlantic

and Pacific Railway, which will probably revolutionise before long the existing lines
of travel, not only to Australia, but also to China and Japan. This new line, which

may be considered an extension westward of the great trunk line of the Atchison,

Topeka and Santa Fe, runs from the old Spanish-American city of Albuquerque in

New Mexico, p.asses through the northern portions of Arizona, and joins the

Southern Pacific at Mojave in California. It thus forms a complete trans-con-
tinental line, on a parallel considerably to the south of any previously existing line.
Its indirect connection, however, with the Southern Pacific, and the new Sonora
line in Mexico is extremely important. The Sonora line has its terminus at the
port of Guaymas, on the Gulf of ( !alifornia. Plere probably, in the not far distant

future, will be the new port of arrival, at least for mails and passengers bound
eastwards from Australia, China, and Japan. At present, Guaymas is a small
                                                                       --

                                                                  TR^iNSACTIONS OF SECTION E.                           591

Mexican town consisting of adobe houses. Its harbour, however, is an excellent

one, with deep water up to the very shore, and well sheltered from every wind. It

is the only possible mail station on the Gulf of California, and is some five hundred

miles, or nearly two days' steaming, nearer Austraha than is San Francisco. The

new Atlantic and Pacific line in its course through Northern Arizona also opens

up a very important tract of country. Of all the Western Territories, Arizona has

long been the most remote and inaccessible, and therefore the least known. It has

been neglected in turn by the miner, the stock-raiser, and the farmer. The aridity

of the climate, and the presence of hostile Apache Indians, has had much to do

with this, but it has been due in a still greater degree to the want of suitable means

of commimication. As the Territory is now provided with two distinct systems of

railway, it is believed that the long isolation from which, since the days of the

Spanish conquerors, the country has suffered, will be soon broken through. Arizona

is a coimtry of extraordinary mineral wealth. In many parts of its extensive

territory, it offers large tracts of excellent land to the farmer and the stock-raiser.

Its chief drawback is a want of water, but this can be supphed as required by irri-

gation works and by Artesian wells. Coal, salt, and the precious metals exist in
Arizona in larger quantities probably than in anyof tbe Western mining territories.

The copper mines are even now the richest known, but as the country is opened up

stiU greater returns will probably be obtained. The area of the ten-itory is about

114,000 square miles, or approximately 73,000,000 acres ; in other words, three

times the size of the State of New York. The general topography of the country

is that of a plateau sloping towards the south and west from an altitude of 7 OOO

feet to the sea-level. The surface of Arizona is much diversified, and contains some

of the finest scenery in North America. In no country of the world can tlie

evidences of past geological action be better studied. The'Canon of the Colorado

is a stupendous water- worn chasm, 400 miles long, and from a quarter of a mile to
a mile and a quarter in depth. The scenery in many parts of Arizona is grand and

impressive                                           in  others,  the  landscape  is  little  better  than  a  desert.  The whole
                                                  ;

country is still a strange mixture of the old and new. Life there is in its main
features much the same as it was when Coronado, in 1.540, led his bands of Cas-
tilians through the country in search of the ' Seven Cities.' But this phase of

existence is rapidly passing away, and before long Arizona will awake from the

sleep of centuries which has till now weighed upon her.

A4. Journey in Russian Central Asia, indudinq Kulja, Bolcliara, and

             Khiva. By the Rev. Henry Lansdell, i).B., F.E.G.S.

     The author described a sLx montlis' journev performed by him during the latter
half of 1882, of 12,145 miles (5,000 by rail," 3,4()0 by water, 3,000 by road, and
800 in saddle, or cradle), having for its principal object the distribution of religious
literature in prisons and hospitals, and the collection of ethnological and general

information.

     Leaving London, June 26, the author arrived at Tobolsk on August 12, and
steamed up the Irtish to Omsk, the capital of the new general government of the
Steppe, lately formed of the provinces of Akmolinsk and Semipalatinsk out of
AVestern Siberia and the province of Semiretchia, hitherto part of llussian
Turkistan. This general government, with that of Turkistan (consisthig of the

provinces of Syr Daria, Amu Daria, Fergana, and Zerafshan), now makes up

* Russian Central Asia.' In fourteen days from August 19, the author posted
1,198 miles through Semipalatinsk, over the Chingiz-tau, passing the east end of Lake
Balkash, and up the Hi valley to Kulja. Here he visited a Sibo encampment, and
the Chinese governor at Suidun, after which he followed the post road through
the towns of Vernoi, Auli-Ata, and Chlmkend, to Tashkeud. Dr. Lansdell then
proceeded southwards to Kokand and Samarcand, and crossed the Hissar moun-
tains at the Takhta-Karacha pass (5,180 feet) to Shehr-i-Sebz, where he was
received by the Emir of Bokhara, and treated as a guest during his stay in the
Khanate. Proceeding thence 148 miles, through Chirakchi and Karshi, he
arrived on the sixth day at the City of Bokhara. I^eaving this place on August 16,
he passed through Kara-kul, and across the Sundukli sands to Charjui, a journey
of 48 miles in three days, ami then, with 6 hordes, a tarantass, 2 interpreters,
8 oarsmen, and 5 mounted guards on shore as a protection from the Turkomans,

he floated down the Amu-daria 300 miles, to the Russian fort Petro-Alexandrovsk,
reachmg it safely on October 26. Dr. Lansdell then re-crossed the Oxus to Khiva,
and twice had audience of the Khan, after which he left on November 2 for

a journey of 107 miles on horseback through the cultivated districts of Shahkhavat,

Tashausj and Ilyali, to Kunya Urgentch, where a most interesting visit was paid
to ruins said to date from the time of Genghis Khan. The author next prepared,

with 2 interpreters, 2 camel-drivers, 2 horses, and five camels, to cross the Aralo-
Oaspian desert. Proceeding by the well of Karategin, the last shepherd was

spoken with on November 10, after which the party met no human beings for
eleven days. The route lay along the old Oxus bed to the Sarykamish lake, and

then continued in a south-westerly direction to wells at Uzuu-kuyu, and
Kazakhli, after which the travellers descended into the dry bed of an inland sea,
and skirted the cliffs of Kaplan Kir. The wells of Sekhiskhan and Tuer were
passed, after which, from the summit of the Sari-baba hills, was seen the Kara-
Boghaz bay of the Caspian. The well of Demerdjen was safely reached, Suili was

passed, and on November 22, after a journey of 403 miles from Kunya Urgentch,

the party arrived at Krasnovodsk. Dr. Lansdell then crossed the Caspian to
Baku, whence, after visiting the oil wells and naphtha fires of the neighbourhood,

he proceeded by the new, but then unopened, railway to Tiflis, and so home by Poti
 and Odessa, having fully accomplished the objects of his journey.

  The following Papers and Report were read :        By H. H. Johnston.

A1. Visit to Mr. Stanley's Stations on the Congo.

Towards the end of Decemher 1882 the author visited Mr. H. M. Stanley at

"Vivi Station, which he describes as ahout 360 feet above sea-level, and rising 370

feet clear above the Congo. The projecting mass of cliff on which it is placed

becomes higher as it nears the river, and is almost unapproachable except from the

inland side. On the summit and the riverward edge of the clifi' is a flat and level

platform, nearly artificial and about 80 feet square, on which the most important

houses are built.

    On January 7 he left Vivi for Isangila and Stanley Pool, accompanied by three

picked Zauzibaris as personal servants. The journey to Isangila, the next station

\o Vivi, occupied three days and a half. The road was nothing more than a native
path, in many places lost in marsh or invisible and untraceable in the high grass.

The scenery between Vivi and Isangila is very beautiful in parts, an alternation of
green hills and thickly forested ravines, with many tumultuous streams. Isangila

Station, like most of Stanley's establishments, is placed on a high hill above the

river. The great rapids or falls of the Congo opposite the station are very grand.

Between IsangUa and Manyanga is a distance of eighty miles, which it took four

days to accomplish in a little river-steamer. The current is terribly strong, and

the scenery here poor and uninteresting. Manyanga is a fine station and very well
provided with native food. Five hundred eggs may sometimes be bought in one
day at the neighbouring market. From jNIanyanga to Lutete, on the south bank

of the Congo, is about twenty miles. Lutete is a briglit and pretty little station

near a verj^ large native village, from which it takes its name. From Lutein to

Stanley Pool, about eighty miles, the scenery is beautiful and the country well

AHpopulated.  along this great ivory route, the pine-apple, introduced by the

native traders from the coast, grows abundantly. Ngoma is the next of Stanley's

stations, and fifteen miles beyond is LeopoldviUe, situated at the opening to

Stanley Pool. It is placed on a commanding height looking down on the opposite

shore, where Mfwa, or ' Brazzaville,' is prospectively situated. Here there were
only six or seven native huts, and the inhabitants retained little, if any, remem-

brance of the hasty passage of De Brazza. The scenery on Stanley Pool, with its
many wooded islands, high cliffs, and distant mountains, is described as enchanting.
At the further entrance to the pool is Kimpoko, a pretty little station embowered

in Borassus palms. The journey up stream to Msuata, near the mouth of the great
Ibhbuma-Quango river, occupied six days in a rowing boat. At Msuata Station

Mr. Johnston passed six weeks, the scenery and natural history of the district

being most interesting. From Msuata to Bolobo, another week's journey, the

---scenery became increasingly beautiful Bolobo itself, with the splendid broadening

of the Congo and the matchless forest scenery on its banks, being difficult to

describe adequately. Life is rendered miserable at this station by the incessant

·plague of mosquitoes. The author's explorations terminated with a day's journey

beyond this station.

     The principal races on the Congo between Bolobo and Stanley Pool are the
Batek^, the Bayansi, and the Wabuma. All these peoples are comparatively

recent settlers on the river. The Batelfe are what might be called resident

colonists from the north-west between the Ogowe and Congo. The Bayansi have
come down the river from the Equator and the north-east, and are the great

travellers and traders of the Upper Congo. The Wabuma are the people inhabiting

the river Quango in its lower course. Tliey would seem at some former time to have

heen driven from the north-west hefore the Bat^ke, and to have crossed the Congo.

They are often made slaves of by the Bateke and Bayansi, and are a less handsome

race than these latter. They appear to he allied in language and origin to the

Aboma, encountered by De Brazza near the Upper Ogowe and the Alima Eiver.

All these natives on the CoDgo are kindly, merry, and courteous in beha'\'iour,

with splendid physical development, and great artistic skill shown in decorating

their utensils and weapons. Their languages are dialects of the most thorough

--' Bantu ' character. That of the Wabuma is strongly guttural otherwise in

many of its words it offers some resemblance to the Mpongwe of the Gaboon.

The Bateke is more alhed to Congo, and the Bayansi presents some resemblance to

the East Coast tongues. In all these languages there are many words almost

identical with the Kaffir, Kiswahili, and Damara tongues. Zanzibaris can often

make themselves understood in their native dialect on the Congo.

   --The natural history of the Congo may be divided into three regions the

district of the coast, the cataracts, and the Upper Congo beyond Stanley Pool.

The coast region is simply swampy forest country, exactly similar to the Gold

Coast and Upper  Guinea  in its  tlora  and faima                                          the cataract region  is poor, and
                                                                                        ;

more resembles Angola in its natural histoiy. At Stanley Pool a great change

takes place in the fauna and flora, and manj^ new forms of birds, insects, and

plants suddenly appear. This same character of fauna and flora apparently

continues, according to Stanley, unaltered to the Stanlej^ Falls. It may also be

noticed that Schweinbiirth observed on the Upper "\^'elle some foims of plants,

more especially palms, which Mr. Johnston first saw at and beyond Stanley Pool.

The climate of the Upper Congo is very agreeable, and in the author's case

healthy. The greatest heat registered at mid-day was 96° in the shade, but the

normal and almost unvarjiug temperature at noon was 87

3. On the Volcanic and Earthcpial-e Tlerjiovs of Central America, ivitU
          Observations on Recent Plienomcna. By Wjlliam Hancock.

The author entered 3Iexico at Acapulco on November 12 last year. Crossing

the Pdo de la Yenta he arrived at La Providencia on a table-land at 2,000 feet, and

at the base of the Sierra Madre, then examined the extinct volcano of Zapotilla

(3,000 feet). From ]\Iexico he travelled by sea to San Jose de Guatimala, and

thence to the lake of Amatitlan. The volcano of Pacaya (8,400 feet) was ascended
Afrom this point.
                   regular truncated cone rises from the interior of an ancient

crater. The summit contains a crater, about 2.j0 feet in diameter by 100 feet deep :

the circumference is fissured, and moderate volumes of steam were issuing from the

fissures. Chemical action was not apparent. The last great eruption was in 1775.

A parasitic cone exists against one side of the ancient crater rim in the interior.

Between Amatitlan and Guatimala enormous deposits of pumice were passed.

The Guatimala plateau approaches the lake in an escarpment exhibiting a trachytic

formation. The region round the volcanoes Aqua, Fuego, and Acateuango was A-isited.

The last eruption of Fuego was in July 1880 : lava was discharged on the Pacific

slope. During the author's residence in the district, retumbos, or underground

rumblings, were not infrequent. From Guatimala Salvador was reached, and the

volcano of Izalco ascended as far as possible. The eruptions occurred on an average

once in thirteen minutes; tlie smoke and vapour rose to from 1,000 to 2,000 feet

above the crater; showers of pumice and sand were ejected. Several slight earth-

quake shocks were experienced at San Salvador. The lake of Ilopango was visited,

and the volcano in the centre, which came upon Jantiary 20, 1880, and is gradually
sinking again. Between December 24 and 30, 1879, 372 earthquake shocks were

recorded at the lake side. The water had a strong odour of sulphuretted hydrogen.

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  59o

From Salyador the author proceeded to La Union in the Gulf of Fonseca. The
islands are all extinct volcanoes. Oosio^uina was passed. During the eruption of
January 20, 1835, the ashes were carried to Jamaica and Santa Fe de Bogota, and

the explosions were heard at Belize, 800 miles distant. Journeying from Corinto
to Managua in Nicaragua, the volcanoes of El Viejo, Santa Clara, Telica Orota,

Acosusco, Las Pilas, and Momotombo were passed. Momotombo rises from the
edge of the lake. Near Managua the sunken craters were filled with water ; Tiscapa,
Nihapa, and Asosoca were examined, and the volcano of Masaya was ascended.
The twin volcano of Nindiri exliibits an ancient crater, shallow, and having a flat
circular floor. Subsequently it burst again into eruption from two new craters, one

at each side and within the original crater, and the undermining by the expulsion
of lava caused the original floor to drop in three steps, leaving terraces all round.

     The author considers that the existing volcanoes of Masaya and Nindiri are
merely cones in the centre of a flat crater about 20 miles in circumference. The
lake of Masaya is included withm the walls. It is approached by a path down the
face of a crater-like precipice, 350 feet in height ; the lake is 400 feet deep. The
volcano of Jlombacbo was seen at Granada, and several of the volcanic islands in
the lake of Nicaragua were visited, including Zapatera, which exhibits a sunk crater
filled with water. The adjacent island of Ometepec the author was prevented from
visiting through unfavourable ^veather ; since then (February), according to accovmts
received, the volcano of the same name has broken out in eruption after years of
repose, and the inhabitants have retired from the island.

                    4. Nos Vey and the South-West of Madagascar.
                            By the Rev. S. J. Peert, F.B.8.

     The Government expedition for the observation of the Transit of Venus on
December 6, 1882, was the occasion of a visit to the South-West of Madagascar.

The observers were the Rev. S. J. Perry and the Rev. W. Sidgreaves, accompanied
by Mr. W. Carlisle. They were landed by (Japtain Aldrich, R.N., from H.M.S.

Fawn, on the small island of Nos Vey, a few miles south of St. Augustine's Bay,
and this paper contained the results of their observations of the country and its
mhabitants during their short stay of a few weeks.

     After a brief sketch of the history of the establishment of the French and
English traders at Nos Vey, a description was given of the native tribes, of their
character and general treatment of Europeans, of their dress, dwellings, religion,
charms, and customs. The peculiar state of slavery among the savages of the
South- West of Madagascar was dwelt upon at some length, and also the nature of
the authorit}^ exercised by the petty kings. The paper concluded with some
remarks on the natural history and climate of Nos Vey.

 5. On the Somali and Galla Countries. By E. G. Ravenstein, F.B.0.8.

     The author, having given a sketch of the history of geographical explorations
in these countries, dwelt upon the native information available for the compilation
of the Royal Geographical Society's map of Equatorial Africa, and finally enlarged

upon the information obtained bj^ the Rev. C. Wakefield from natives. He pointed

to Kisimayu as a port presenting peculiar facilities to a traveller desirous of
penetrating into the country of the Bworani Galla.

subject to causes wliicli have ceased to operate, as, first, the difficulties of the

navigation, now minimised by steam ; secondly, the exclusive system of the Dutch

in the Spice Islands, which hindered explorations of the regions further east, and

latterly the diversion of the stream of enterpi'ise towards Australia. As regards the
first, the unsurveyed reefs and channels of Torres Straits, the mud fiats and

shallows further west, the concentrated violence of the monsoon on the south
coast, and the precipitous and harbourless character of the northern, were no doubt
formidable to sailing vessels ; but it is strange that the position, central between

India, China, and Australia, never attracted official exploration.

    New Guinea was actually discovered about 1526-28. More is probably due to
the old Spanish navigators than is usually supposed. By the time of Torres, who

achieved the Southern passage in 1606 (though this is given, mysteriously, in maps
of earlier date), the whole coast line, excepting the north coast from Cape Finisterre
eastwards, was roughly known. The author traces its geological relations with

Australia, showing the date of their separation to be probably not earlier than the
Lower Miocene, shells of that period being found on the east of the Gulf of Papua

identical with those of the same series in Victoria and South Australia. Of the New
Guinea amphibia, too, those not of wide distribution are exclusively Australian. On

the west side of the Gulf, from the swampy plains intersected by the Fly and other
streams which bring down the drainage from the mountainous interior, isolated
hills of Australian character rise abruptly, which apparently, like the higher
islands of Torres Straits, escaped the submersion which insulated both. The
plains, since they emerged, have been mainly occupied by an Indo-Malay vegeta-
tion. The palseozoic rocks of the Eastern Peninsula, judging from small specimens
of mica slate, quartz, sandstones, greenstones, and jasperoids, are undistinguishable

from the Silurian and Devonian series of the New South Wales goldtields ; but

as yet gold has been found only in very small quantities. The mountains in the
north-west seem chiefly granite and gneiss. From the Gulf of Papua to Princess
Marianne Island the sea is so shallow and the coast so low that land is invisible
from shipboard. Here a great submarine bank extends to the Aru Islands, which

jMx. Wallace shows to have formed part of the mainland of New Guinea. The

west and north coasts are chiefly precipitous (the clift's frequently of I'ccent lime-
stone with raised coral beaches), broken by considerable rivers attbrding access to
the interior. Otherwise the densely wooded mountain ranges make such access
difficult, though in places these rise in terraces which are highly cultivated. The
north coasts are almost free from reefs, which, however, skirt the south coast of the
Eastern Peninsula, forming within them valuable harbours and anchorages. Vessels

stationed in these would command the passage both of Torres Straits, and of China

Straits at the eastern extremity, which are the important routes from Australia to
India and China respectively. The interior here consists of ranges of rolling grassy
hills, sparsely wooded with acacias, eucalyptus, &c., and interspersed by streams and
fertile tracts well fitted for tropical cultivation, as sugar, &c. Beyond is the central

 range, 13,000 feet.
      Severe earthquakes occur on the north coast, but no active volcanoes have been

seen. They may however exist, and Mr. W. Powell observed a mass of pumice at a
considerable height, opposite to New Britain, but the great volcanic energy of that
 island seeujs to die away in the small islands to the west, and to pass north-west,

through the Schouten group, towards the Moluccas and Philippines.
      The forests contain magnificent timber, fruits, spices, barks, and gums. The

sago palm (about which statistics are given) and sugar may become great staples.
 There are also tracts suited for cattle-raising. It is a question how far the good
 lands are unoccupied. The natives have a keen sense of rights in the soil, indi-

 vidual and tribal, and even in the fruits of the forest trees and the fish of the streams
 belonging to the tribe ; and they probably would not w^ork regularly for Europeans.
 Perhaps confidence might be created first by establishing trading depots. There is
 an active trade between the hill and coast tribes in their respective produce and

--manufactures, and in Western New Guinea a small foreign trade sago, massoi

 bark, and bird-skins being the chief exports, but their wants are veiy few ; thus,

though the resources of the country are great, the chances of immediate profit

from their development are doubtful.

The people  of  the northern coasts generally     are superior to those of  the  south
                                                                                                                 ;

this the author suggests may he due to their having been recruited to a much

greater extent from the emigrations which have passed eastwards from Asia to the

Pacitic, while the foreign intercourse of the southern coast has heen mainly with the

inferior Australians. The mass of the people are of that negroid Melanesiau race

which, variously modified by Malay or Polynesian or other elements, extends from

Flores eastward through New Guinea to Fiji and New Caledonia. Their religion

is mainly ancestor worship, the Karwar or imiige of a (recently) dead progenitor
being gi'eatly venerated, for the spirit of the dead has passed into it ; a man will
therefore sooner sell the skull than the Karwar of his father. They dread the
spirits of the dead, and some other beings not of human origin. They show much

artistic taste in the ornamentation of their houses, weapons, utensils, and ornaments.

Tliey are a rude, boisterous people, with doubtful capacities for cidture, though the

children in the Dutch mission schools do well.

The Eastern Peninsula is partly occupied by a different race, fairer and milder,

with Polynesian afiiuities, but their religion seems to have none of the distinguish-

ing Polynesian characteristics, and indeed to be more rudimentary than the Papuan.

Their relations with English explorers have been exceptionally good, and it is

desirable (even from an economical point of view), that steps should be taken to

regulate their intercourse with the whites before serious collisions occur. With our

great experience much might be done in this respect, and the protection thus

atforded to the people would more than compensate for interference -ndth individual

liberty. They have no political organisation, the tribes being isolated, and the

power of the chiefs small ; hereditary rank, though a Polynesian, is not a genuine
Papuan conception, and is only found among the more advanced tribes. The

level of civilisation varies : some tribes are accomphshed cultivators. Their

agriculture is probably a tradition from Asia ; most of then* plants of cultivation
too are Asiatic. Other tribes are nomad, and very low in the social scale. Canni-
balism is not common, and perhaps chiefly confined to war time, when the practice

of head-taking also prevails.

The Malay custom of building houses on piles is general, but sometimes they

are built on the groimd, or perched high up in trees, as among other Melanesians.

    Curious claims of sovereignty over New Guinea have been asserted, since the

spread of Islam in the Archipelago in the fifteenth century, by the Malay rulers of
the diminutive islands Bachian, Gebe, and Tidor. The Dutch found their own

claims vaguely on the last, as being his suzerain, and have annexed the western

part as far east as 140° 47' E. But the Tidor claims never extended so far, nor

indeed inland at all, being enforced only by periodical raids for tribute and slaves,
which have checked civilisation and perhaps thrown it back, for there were

formerly powerful fleets of Papuan pirates, and in the fifteenth century we hear of
a league of ' the Papuas ' vdth the ISIoluccans against the Portuguese. The Dutch

rule has hitherto been little more than nominal.

     Disclaimmg controversy, the author points out that with the present tendency

of matters in the Pacific, and the certainty that the development of New Guinea

must be the work of English hands and capital, its separation from the Australian

system, to which it naturally belongs, would be a grave political inconvenience,

crippling the future of that system, and leadnig to vastly increased armaments ; to

say nothing of the neighbourhood of foreign convict settlements, or (if the island

remained unannexed), of an Alsatia of lawless adventurers.

                  2. On North Formosa. By William Hakcock.

    The author was resident in Tamsui for the greater part of the year 1881, and
during that period had opportunities of examining the geology, flora, and fauna

of the district. He described the steam geysers and extinct craters, the peculiar

lava-field near Tamsui, and the v'arious earthquake shocks which had taken place,
598 REPOET-- 1883.

especially that of December 1867, when the sea retired from the harbour of
Kelung, and returning in the form of two waves overwhelmed a number of the
inhabitants ; the towns of Kelung, Tamsui, Kimpaoli, and Pachena being all more

or less ruined.

     The peculiarities of the flora were touched upon, and its relation to that of the
mainland of China opposite, and the island of Ilainan the riclmess of a temperate

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

zone flora in the matter of flowers as compared with a tropical flora was specially
referred to, and allusion was made to the lemarkable floral displays in the province
of Gheldang during the spring months, when the mountains exhibit many of the
most conspicuous British greenhouse shrubs. The autbor proceeded to describe
the aborigines in this particular part of the island, their manners and customs,
especially the different form of tatoo in male and female, their wonderful agility
and mode of hunting. Having succeeded in making friends with a chief, he was
taken into the forest, hostages having been left in the hands of the Chinese. The
forest presented a marvellous wealth of tropical and semi-tropical vegetation,
camphor trees being specially conspicuous, and ferns, more particularly Ilymeno-
2)hyllum, clothing the trunks of the trees. The impression left by the savages was
pleasant ; they appeared to discriminate particularly between a foreigner and the
Chinese. The prevalence of typhoons was spoken of, and the disastrous consequences
entailed were described. These storms appear to have their origin generally in the
sea between the Philippines and Hainan, passing up the coast of (!hina and crossing

to Japan.

     The volcanic relations which subsist between Formosa and Japan on the one
hand, and the Philippines on the other, were referred to, the island being described
as a link in the great volcanic chain extending from Kamchatka to the East Indies.

          3. On the Advance of the Southern Chinese.
           By Holt S. Hallett, M.Inst.C.E., F.B.G.8.

The following are the chief historic facts and dates brought forward by the

author :--The Chinese Emperor Yaou, who came to the tlirone B.C. 2356, sent the
family, or tribe, of Hi to take the government of the country to the south of the

Yangtsi. Kingdoms thus foi-med extended to the south of Tonquiu, li.c. 2208.

The Annamites and Shans trace their earliest dynasties to ( 'hinese imperial

families. Their kingdoms were in existence Avithin the bounds of the Chinese

Empire before its earliest contraction. Previous to the abolition of feudalism,

B.C. 246, the Empire was divided into a varying number of principalities, whose

dependence varied with the power of the reigning Emperor. By B.C. 1550, owing

to revolts, it had contracted to within the n(n-thern bank of the Yangtsi iviang;

and during the Chou dynasty, B.C. 11^4-255, seldom included any portion of the

basin of that river.

The founder of the Chou dynasty divided the Empire into seventy-two

principalities, and appointed his relations as rulers over them. His elder brother

left the Empire, and founded the kingdoms of Youe and Hon on the frontiers of

Ssu-ch'uan. The rulers of the kingdoms left outside by the contraction of the Empire

still hold the title of Chou that was borne by the princes of the Chinese Empire.

Other evidence leads to the conviction that the Shans formed part of the early

Chinese horde. M. Terrien de Lacouperie allows that over thhty per cent, of the

Shan vocabidary has come from the same source as that of the Chinese.
    Long before the time of Gandama, b.c. 543, the Yun Shans had founded towns

to the south of Yunnan, and were pushing down the valley of the Mekong through
the Yun or Karen country. These Karens, there is reason to believe, were the

furthest  advance  party of  the Chinese  immigration                                                             for a long  period  they  ruled
                                                                                                               ;

over the kingdom of Youe-chang (Tchen-Tchinsf, I^in-y, or Lam-ap), and in the

fourth century over Cambodia. In a.d. 431, the Yun Shans founded several cities in

the valley of the Menam, and by 707 they had overrun and occupied the northern

half of Cambodia.

    Early in tlie sixth century B.C., the Man Shans entered the valley of the

Irrawadi, and drove the Burmese tribes to the southward. About A.D. 1220, they
annexed Assam, and became predominant over the Shan States to the east and

west of the Salween as far south as Zimme. By the end of the thirteenth century,
they had shattered the Burmese Empire, driven the Yun Shans to Chaliang (from

whence the latter descended and founded the kingdom of Siani), attacked Java,
Malacca, and Cambodia, annexed part of Pegu, and extended their sway over the

Malay Peninsida as f;ir soutli as Tavoy. From this time to A.D. 1554, Sliau princes

were ruling in the valleys of the Irrawadi, Sittang, and Salween, as well as in
the couutry to the south of Yunnan, as far eastward as Cochin Cliiua.

     The Laos Shans were settled in the country to the west of Tonquin at a verv
early date, and had already wedged themselves into the Y'uu country, as far south

as Yien < 'hang, before the arrival of the Yun Shans in the valley of the Menam
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

they are, therefore, known to their neighbours as the Lau, or Lao, which means

ancient or old.

           4. Curiosities of Travel on the Tibetan frontier.
                     Bij E. CoLBORNK Baber, F.E.G.'S.

Li a paper illustrating the difficulty of the problems which a traveller in an

unexplored country is called upon to examine, the author gave an account of the

curious wax-insect of Western China, the eggs of which are transported from a

valley on the border of Y'unnan to a plain in Westerji Ssu-ch'uan, a distance of
A --more than 200 miles.
           great multitude of carriers ten thousand or more in
--number, travelling in single tile all tlirough the night, and resting by day convey

the galls to their destination, where they are attached to trees, on which the insects

deposit wax and breed. He also described, in some detail, his discovery of the

singular fact that a certain kind of timber, which is used to make cofilns, and is of

extraordinary value on account of its resistance to the attacks of insects and rot, is

found buried deeply in the soil, and is actually mined for, either by sinking shafts

or by a process of ' hydraulickiug.' Tlie trunks are of great size, and a coffin made

of the planks which they atfovd is worth some 800/. This valuable material is

found imbedded in a hard yellow clay, which Mr. Baber suggests may be tha-till

or boulder-claj". The sub-IIimalayan region in question exhibits manifest traces

of glaciers, by which, according to the latest school of geologists, the till has been

formed

Some remarks on an analysis of the so-caUed ' white copper ' of Western

Cliina, and on an antelope which may have given rise to Abb6 Hue's fable of the

Unicorn, concluded the paper.

      5. 071 the Athabasca District of the Canadian North-West Territory.

                               By the Rev. Emile Petitot.

    The author, who belonged to the Congregation of the Oblats-de-Marie French
missionaries, commenced his explorations in the Canadian North-West so long ago

as April 1804, continuing them from 1865 to 1873. lie published a preliminary
account of these in the Bulletin of the French Geographical Society for July-
September 1875, which is here recast, with material additions and personal obser-

vations acqinred during subsequent travel as late as 1879.

      After defining the limits of the commercial district of Athabasca as settled in
the latter year by the Hudson's Bay Company, and briefly sketching its great
natural features, M. Petitot describes in detail the systems of the Athabasca and

Peace rivers, which after uniting and entering tlie Great Slave Lake, take the name
of the ^lackenzie, and he also treats Lake Athaljasca in like manner, with its connected

minor lakes and smaller affluents. In doing this he corrects various errors as to
the nomenclature, position, and physical features of the Aery complex water-system
of the region, with numerous observations on its geologj-, fauna, flora, and native
inhabitants, and indications of probable sources of future development. The chief

points are bis minute details of tlie alterations in tlie course, and especially in the
mouths, of the Athabasca and Peace rivers, -n-bicb at the point of junction with

the Slave river at the western extremity of Lake Athabasca now form vast deltas

of sedircentary land, available for cultivation in a region elsewhere almost entirely
wanting vegetable earth. The extremely variable hydi'ographic conditions are

owing to an abnormal intercommunication between the three great watercourses
above named, so that an excess of supply from the catchment basin of any one of
them is passed over to the others. The various causes and stages of formation of
new land, with the consequent development of vegetation &c., are fully explained
and the author entertains great hope (though there can be no absolute certainty on
the point) that the vast reclaimed area will remain in its present condition.

      In discussing the Indian tribes be refers to their great diminution from the
consequences of an excessive destruction of animals available for food. The whole
population of the district, including red-skins, half-castes, and whites, was in 1879
only 2,268.

    An historic sketch and statistical and meteorological tables were given in this

memoir, which with its accompanying map has been translated and published in
the Proceedings of the Eoyal Geographical Society for November 1883.

1. The Cotton Trade: its Gondition and Prospects} Bij Edwin Guthrie.

For a number of years now the cotton trade has suffered severe depression. In

spite of the improved appliances of the present day as compared with those of ten

or twenty years ago, hy means of which improvements the cost of converting

cotton into yarn is at least a halfpenny per pound weight cheaper, the profit

obtainable  is  less  than  it  was,  until  now                          simple interest is  all  that is  generally
                                                                       ;

made upon the capital employed in the trade, which is not a proper rate of

compensation for all the contingencies incident to fixity of costly plant.

     The following tables show the course of our trade in relation to that of other

--three positions of manufacture viz., Continental Europe, the United States, and

India :

Table I. Consumption of Cotton in Gheat Beitain, Continent of Eueope,
        AND United States, feom 1836, in aveeage peeiods op Five Yeaes.
     --

602  KEPORT-- 1883.

      These tables sliow several things :
      1. That the production of the world's crop has steadily increased from the first
development of the trade, except during or immediately succeeding the period
of the American war.
     2. That the absolute quantity consumed in Great Britain has steadily increased
iu like manner and with the like exception.
      .'3. That the absolute quantity used iu the three other positions has also

increased in like manner.
     4. That the ratio of increase has been gi-eath^ in favour of all the positions

except that of Great Britain.

     Thus, if we have regard to the first three indications, the matter appears
wholly a subject for congratulation. If we have regard to the last indication, the

appearance is that the cotton trade of Great Britain does not fiourish so well as

that of other countries.

     The gi'owth of the trade in other countries has been assisted by the following
causes : The increased facilities of transit and commvmication have rendered it
possible for cotton to reach the point of mauuificture, almost wherever that point
may be, at about the same cost ; thus the raw material, which formerly (so far as
it was used upon the continent of Europe) was landed in Liverpool, goes direct
from the cotton-growing States to the Continent, and our competitors there have not

now to bear double port charges, double freights, double or treble profits in

transitu.

     The British goodwill of the business is being narrowed by the difi'usion of the
trade, consequent upon its being made easy to all.

      Under the second head the tariils imposed by foreign nations upon British

manufactures, and the restrictions upon our own labour imposed by our Factory
Acts, press adversely upon the trade in Great Britain. Under the Act of 184S

the hours of labour in cotton mills were reduced from 69 to 60, and by the Act of
1870 to 56^. The hours worked on the Continent are generally from 68 to 72, a
difference of about 30 per cent.

     The cost incident to the spinning of cotton may be roughly divided iuto five

--elements -viz., (1) cost of raw material, (2) cost of mills and machinery, (3) cost

of power, (4) cost of labour, (5) cost of reaching the consumer.

     In the lirst-named element we have lost the advantage we had, as before

explained.

     In the second we mif/kt have a distinct advantage, for the mills in working

condition erected in England represent a value of about 1/. per spindle and 20/. per
loom, while the mills of the Continent and the United States represent a value
of about three times that amount ; but this advantage is in great part, if not
entirely, overbalanced by the nmnber of hours worked by our competitors being

much greater, thus reducing the charge per pound of production, represented under
the head of rent, depreciation, and interest.

     In the third we have if anything some little advantage, for coal is nowhere
cheaper than in Lancashire, although, by the great economy of fuel now possible

in consequence of the improvements in engines, boilers, and machinery, the relative

importance of this element of cost is much smaller than formerly, and our advantage

 is a lessened one.

     In the fourth element, labour, we are under a distinct disadvantage.
     In the fiftli element of cost we have no appreciable advantage in neutral markets,
while within their own boundaries our competitors have an advantage in a saving

 of carriage.

     Of these five principal elements of cost three may be regarded as rigid, and not

within the control of the spinners, the two others being elastic and variable at the

--will of the workers. They are (1) rent, interest and depreciation which foUow

the number of hours worked, and (2) the cost of labour.
     The competition to which we are parties is not between labour and capital

within our own boundaries, but between labour at home and labour abroad, and

not wholly between English and foreign labour, but, in a great measure, between

Lancashire labour at home and Lancashire labour abroad ; for not onlv are we
                                                TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.                         603

eonstautly supplying- the best macliiiiery, but the best Lancashire hands to the
mills of the Continent, the United States, and India.

     The author does not wish to advocate a return of British workpeople to au nn-
necessarj' increase of labour, or any unnecessary sacrifice of the beneficial influences of
properlj- applied leisure; but, with the facts before them, it is for the co-partnership
of capital and labour to determine in what proportion tliey can afford to appropriate
their time between labour and leisure.

     It is ti'ue that for every farthint; which might be saved in increased economy in
respect of the elements of cost within our control, we are handicapped five or ten
farthings by the protective tarifis of other countries, but theii are not within our
control^ and a saving of even a farthing a pound often makes all the difference
between good trade and bad trade.

     It has been urged in some quarters that the remedy for trade depression is to
be found in the closing of our mills one or two days a week, so as to limit supply'
and so stimulate demand.

     In the author's opinion such a course would be suicidal, for, while it would enhance
the cost of production to ourselves, it would not affect the cost to our competitors of
their productions, while they would equally participate in the advantages of the
advance in price. So they would be encouraged to erect new mills, and to the

extent to which we had thrown our own mills out of employment voluntarily,

the}' would have to remain closed afterwards under compulsion of the secondary

effects of our own acts.
     The present depressed condition of things is thus attributable to the reality of

foreign competition, encouraged by twofold causes, viz., (1) the legitimate effects of

improved appliances arising out of the common human advancement, and (2) the

illegitimate consequence of international 'boycotting,' that is to say, protective

tariffs, and of our own internal trade restrictions.
     The only hope of relief lies in the economy of our work, the quality of our

workmanship, our own persistent loyalty to the ]n-inciples of liberty in relation to
trade, and the gradual recognition on the part of other nations of the same great

principle.

2. An Attempt at the more Definite Statement of the Malthusian Principle.^

                             Bij the Rev. William Cunningham.

! 1. The princi])le of Malthus was well founded, and soon attained general accept-

ance                      but  this  leads  to  its  being  sometimes  stated in  an  exaggerated  form, and
                       ;

bemg used as an excuse for apathy in regard to human misery.

2. There must be (somewhere or other) an absolute limit to the possible produc-

tion from the globe, and, as population increases steadily in many lands, the

reaching of this absolute limit of possible production is a mere question of time.

I 3. '.Popidation tends to increase faster than the means of subsistence arei
increased.' This seems to mean more than that population is capable of so in-

creasing, and to be a statement in regard to actual occurrences. If so it can only

-- --be proved bj- showing that population where definitely observed has tended to

increase faster than the means of subsistence were increased.

I 4. There is no proof of this from English histor}', and wo prima facie s\XY^ort is

given to it when we compare the growth of population in recent years with that

·of productive power as measured by capital, and of purchasing power as measm-ed

by our exports of native products and manufactures. The tendency to rapid repro-

duction must be regarded as occult in our own land and century. Besides, it is

wise to classify our facts before we assign causes ; especially is this the case when
the whole question is as to the precise effect of a force, tlae reality of which all

admit. The growth of population may be described in three propositions.

6. I. Population has (/enerally increased up to the relative limit set hy the poiver

of procuring subsistence at any yiven time and place.
\ 6i. But skill and enterprise move the relative limit nearer to the absolute limit,

and give popidation the opportunity of advancing-.

--604 EEPOET 1883.

7. II. Sometimes jjopulation does not increase so rapidhj as the qum^tity of pro-

curable subsistence is increased.

8. TLe rate of increase, when an opportunity occurs, depends to some extent

on the definiteness of the organisation of the society in which it occurs.

An9. III.  increase of 2}oj)ulation jchile the relative liinit is unaltered, necessaribj

implies social de<p-adation.

10. But is the reproductive instinct always the efficient cause of this degrada-

tion ? Under certain circimistances the reproductive force appears (1) only to

perpetuate, in others (2) to accelerate degradation, while in some cases it appears

(3) to initiate it. Imprudent habits are not equally to blame in all cases, and the

removal of redundant population or suppression of imprudent habits would not

act similarly in all these cases as a remedy. The existence of a redundant popu-

lation is not to be regarded as characteristic of the normal condition of human

society, but as symptomatic of some special social evil, the precise causes of which^

and probable remedies for which in each particular case, demand our attention.

              4. Oil the Evils arising from the Pollution of Rivers.
                 Bij General Sir J. E. Alexander, K.G.B., F.B.S.E.

     The author belonged for a mimber of years to the Association for the Preserva-
tion of the Rivers and Lochs of Scotland from Pollution, also to the Association for
the Improvement of Scotch Fisheries.

     Mr. F. Buclrlaud's idea was to let the polluted water be evaporated in shallow
tanks and to utilise the deposit. The great impediment to improvement was the
want of co-operation, the proprietors of public works not finding it convenient to

interfere with their tenants. The poor man cannot now afford salmon, which used
to be 6f/. a pound, and is now \s. and 1*. Qd. the pound.

     The author e.xp;(,;-ses his opinion that members of both Houses of Parliament
should energetically take up the question of pollution, and induce the Government
to frame laws, and see them enforced, to preserve our valuable waters for the
health of the people and the production of fish.

     Complaint is made in the paper of the loss of peoples' health by pollution of rivers,
and the loss of horses from the same cause. ]Mr. Smith, of Deanston, near Stirling,

--prevented the sewage of his cotton works spoiling the beautiful Teith a fine salmon

river. Allusion is made to the successful fish-hatching at Howietown, Stirling, by
Sir James G. Maitland, Bart.

    There used to be only eels in the New Zealand rivers ; now good baskets of
trout may be caught in the colony from imported fish. Marine eel-catching is

described.

5. On Free Libraries. Bij Professor Leone Levi, F.8.S.

     The PPvEsident delivered the following Address :

The post of President of this Section is one which any man who is honoured by

the choice of the Council of the Association must feel considerable diffidence in
accepting. There are two main reasons which lead to this. First, he sees on the

roll of your Presidents a long list of names of men whose distinction he cannot

hope to equal ; next, he finds in the growing scope of the subjects discussed at
your meetings an ever-widening field of investigation, the whole of which he
can never hope to master. The ver}' name of the Section bears witness to this

extension of its subject-matter for inquiry. Established originally as the Section

for Statistics, it remained under this title for more than twenty years. Extending
then, and rightly, its scope beyond the limits of Statistics alone, it undertook tf)

deal with that branch of science to which Statistics are especially useful, and became
the Section of Economic Science and Statistics, the title retained luitil the present
day. This very difference in the designation marks out the development of thought

on the subject, a development which I may remark has been greatly assisted by the
labours of my distinguished predecessors in this chair. Their names suggest great
variety of pursuits, great difference of study, but I find one common link uniting

the modes of thought of all, a desire to promote the interest of Economic Science,
and a desire also in practice to promote the best interests of the Empire, by the
application, where possible, of the laws of that Science to the pursuits of ordinary
life. Thus, among the names of earlier Presidents of this Section, there are those
of Mr. Babbage and of Mr. Henry Hallam, the latter known to the present

generation as an historian of the very highest rank, but known also in his own
time as takuig a warm interest in all matters which concerned the social well-beiu"
of the country. Among those former Presidents who have taken a prominent and
valued share in public life, are the names of .Mr. W. E. Forster and the present

Postmaster-General, whose connection with Economic Science is marked by the
fact that he is even better known throughout the country as Professor Favvcett,
than as the holder of his high office. Considerations of space will not permit

me to mention many other names, but I may refer to ^Ir. Tooke, who in his great

work on the history of prices combined soadmirably statistical method with a scien-

march, from whom 1 had myself the privilege to learn much, especiall}' during the
latter years of his life. Of others whom I have had the advantage of knowing, I

may name Mr. James Ileywood, whose continued labours in the service of the

.Association show that our branch of stud}- is well to be reconciled with a calm

and thoughtful life, and who keeps up a warm interest in the work of the Section

over which he presided thirtj^ years ago. ily list of the more recent Presidents-

must close with Professor Jevcns, too early lost to economic study, and Professor

Ingi-am. I have mentioned in particular Professor Ingram's name. I well i-e-

member the enthusiastic language in which Mr. Newmarch spoke to me of his

address before this Section. Bearing this in mind, I wish in the first place to
bring to the remembrance of the present meeting the manner in which Professor
Ino-ram claimed for the science of social life a place in the hiijhest ranks as a branch

of investigation.

    In many respects this claim is generally conceded.
    The position which Economic Science occupies in this country shows how strong
is the hold it possesses over public opinion. Whether our statesmen at all times
interpret its teaching accurately or not, thej' feel bound to profess a deference to
that teaching, or at least to explain the reasons why they ditler from it. And this
is rightly the case. At all times since this country began to commence that re-

markable development of ripening, in gradual, calm, steady progress, from what,
for want of a better term, I must style medi;Xival, to modern modes of thought^
on which it still continues, a growth, as it seems to me, unexampled in the history

of anv other nation, there have been among its citizens able teachers of Economic
truth. Opinions expressed in the reign of Queen Elizabeth by Sir Thomas Gresham,

those held during the reign of Charles II. by Sir "William Petty, are current at the
present time, because they are based on careful observation and sound reasoning.

Our commercial policy is now based on lines laid down nearly a century since by
Adam Smith. And the brilliant success which has followed the financial measures

carried out by Sir Robert Peel and ^Ir. Gladstone results from the ability with

which those statesmen applied the principles of economic teaching to the circum-
stances of the period with which thej" were surrounded. This brief summary
indicates the points in which economic teaching is most sharply brought home to

the minds of the majority of those who think about it at all at the present time.
The}' do not so much think about it as a science, as in that subdivision of its study
which I may best call an art. They say it has brought in free trade. They say

also that while free trade has caused marvellous prosperity to this country, other

countries do ^'ery well without it. Hence they doubt, on what they call practical

grotmds, the teaching of Economic Science.

I do not intend to enter into this controversy here, though I thinlt there can be

no doubt on which .side the truth lies. But I merely use this as ait illustration. If

economic teaching will produce wealth, it is, many people think, worth studymg

on those grounds. If it will not, it is not, in their opinion, worth following. Now,

while I most distmctly desire to assert that nations may, by listening to the lessons

of sound economic teaching, advance their prosperity in many ways, as they have

done by following Free Trade, yet we must not limit the scope of the science to

Weinvestigating the production of wealth alone.    do not say that the sole object

of the science of chemistry is to improve health, though the health of the inhabi-

tants of this country has laeen benefited in no small degree by attending, however

imperfectly, to the teaching of chemical science.

What, then, should the course of action of the careful student of economic

Wethought be at the present time ?  must not think that the study of the produc-

tion and distribution of wealth alone is the sole object of Economic Science ; nor,

again, that everything which the science has to teach has been discovered and

taught already ; that we have now but to classify results, to expound to all future

generations te.xt-books which have been written by our forefathers ; that the whole

kingdom over which observation maj^ extend has been explored and mapped out ;

that everything which can be said on these subjects has been said already. If

we did tliia we should place ourselves entirely and hopelessly iit the wrong. Even

WeHomer, as the fine Greek proverb has it, is not 'enough for everything.'

should, by following this course, limit ourselves in a manner which none who have

sought to work in a scientific spirit have ever done in any other branch of research,

--and should restrict the studj-, the bounds of which we should desire to extend, into

becoming merely a record of the past an empty record, also, for instead of our

investigation being instinct with life, it would soon become a mere series of dead

reminiscences.

In saying this I am not luimindful of the very sagacious remark made by

Professor Ingram, to whose discourse, delivered to this Section at Dublin, I have

referred befoi'e. Speaking of political economy, he observed, ' It is the most difficult

of all the sciences, because it is that in which the phenomena dealt with are the

most complex, and dependent on the greatest variety of conditions, and in Avhich,

accordingly, appearances are most deceitful, and error takes the most plausible forms.'

Bearing this warning in mind, and remembering the limitations already laid down
as to those points which we should shun, let us proceed to consider in "what direc-

tion lies the true course of economic progress.

And here I shall best point out the ]3rocess through which our study may be

aided if I quote from a work which, though it may not in all respects fully come up

--to the promise of its title, yet contains within its pages a great storehouse of genuine

thought the 'Novum Organum Renovatum ' of Dr. Whewell. The first chapter

of Dr. Whewells second book, which deals with the construction of science,

commences thus: The Uvo irrocesses by xohkh science is constructed are the expli-

cation of concej}tioiis, and the colligation of facts. The definition contained in this

statement is so clear and complete that it may almost pass for a truism. But it

contains the axiom on which every science must be founded. Our own observa-

tion places before us constantly the texts of the Book of J^conomic Science, but,

as has been well said, ' these convej^ no knowledge to us till Ave have discovered

the alphabet by which they are to be read.'

Here, again, we shall do well to bear iu mind the warning just quoted as to

Economic Science being the most diffienlt of all the sciences, because, in it, error

takes the most plausible forms. It is because this science deals with the facts of

social life, with matters whicli all can observe, and consequently think themselves

capable of judging, that it appears to be so easy, and in reality is so difficult.

Again, let us consider the circumstances under which the study of political

economy has to be carried on. Political economy exists both as the science

which solves the problems of social existence, and as the art in which that science

is apphed in practice to ordinary life. Now, it difiers from almost every other

branch of science in the fact that in it scarcel}' any experiment is ever possible.

AVe cannot, to revert to a point previously mentioned, call the application of the

principle of Free Trade to the financial legislation of this country an experiment.

It was the work of men confident in their science justly confident, because they
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

felt certain, from the teachings of that science, that the act would succeed.

     But since experiment cannot be tried, what course should the student follow ?

At this point we may with advantage glance for a moment at the two schools into

w^hich economic writers have principally shown a tendency to divide of late years
Athe historic and the philosophic schools.
                                                 science which deals with the facts

of human life, and yet does not admit of experiment, must be the more indebted

to observation. Here, we may see, is the opportunity for those who follow the

historical method. But mere observation directed by no principle is unaware

what facts it should gather, or how the connection of these facts should be

explained. Hence the work is incomplete without the application of correct

theory. This arrangement supposes the pre-existence of theory before the historical

method can be applied. Endeavour to avoid the conclusion as we may, -we are

driven to admit that our science must be founded on theorj-, call it by what name

you will : abstraction, which lies at the root of the deductive, or hypothesis, which

forms the basis of the inductive method.

It is remarkable that in the writings of Adam Smith we may find the habits

of mind exemplified on which both these schools of thought have based their

reasoning. As was well observed by the late Mr. Walter Bagehot, it was precisely
(508 KEPOKT-- 1883.

this position of Adam Smith which gave him his peculiar usefulness. He ful-

filled two functions. On the one hand, he prepared the way for, though he did.

not found, the abstract science of Political Jiconomy. In this sense he is the

legitimate progenitor of llicardo and John Stuart ^lill. On the other hand, he
was also the beginner of a great practical movement, and no man can head a great

practical movement without knowledge of the affairs of ordinary life. There are,

Mr. Bageliot truly observes, scarcely five consecutive pages in the 'AVealth of

Nations ' which do not ' contain some sound and solid observation, important in

practice and replete with common sense. The most experienced men of business
would have been proud of such a fund of just maxims fresh from the life, and it is

·wonderful tliat they shoidd have occurred to an absent student, apparently buried

in books and busied with abstractions.' It is somewhat strange that the opposite

qualities as to habit of mind are traceable in David llicardo. He was the founder

of abstract political economy, but his occupations were the reverse of those in
which it might have been expected that such modes of thought would be encouraged.

He was a shrewd, active man of business, constantly engaged in a very absorbing

occupation. It is the fashion rather to decry Ricardo at this moment, but I think

that those who desire to advance economic study among us may do well to fortify
"themselves by a study of his arguments, though they may not be able to accept

all his conclusions.

     I have endeavoured, in what has been said thus far, to explain tlie principle of

research by which we may hope to extend the bounds of the branch of science

Wewhich we study, and the habits of thought we should desire to cidtivate.

must follow the historical method of research, too little recently followed in this

Wecountry.*  must test economic conclusions by the evidence of facts. But

while we thus accept the necessitj^ of following a deductive method, we must bear

in mind that it is not opposed to, but can only safely be carried out on the lines
marked out by, inductive reasoning. Nor do I, in speaking thus of the historic

method, wish to be understood to endorse without reserve the views of the historic
school. But though I think iu some respects their conclusions are incorrect, I can

well believe that research carried out on the historic method, based on sound

principles, would be very fruitful in results. It is rather, however, the art than the

Wescience of economics which has a hold on the popular mind at this moment.

must not overlook this feeling.

     In active, busy, hard-working England we are too much apt to neglect any
anode of research from which we do not see immediate, marked, and tangible results.

We shall do well to turn this habit of mind, if we can, into tlie service of economic

inquiry. There are several branches of economic study, the investigation of which

might be useful to our country at the present time. I will venture to indicate two

or three of them.

  --First, it is the opinion of some observers of contemporary events men competent
--to form an opinion, from habit of mind and opportunity of obsen-ation that the
--days of exuberant prosperity to this country the days in which, to use an expres-
--sion now historic, prosperity advanced ' by leaps and bounds' are over. I shall

not pause now to examine into the grounds upon which this opinion is founded,

I do not intend to put it forward in an extreme sense, as if I believed it possible

that all the brilliant and luxuriant growth of vigorous' power by which we are

surrounded is about immediately to pass into the ' sere and yellow leaf,' and to fade
away at once. But it is, I think, quite possible, without expecting any change
as marked as this to come on immediately, that the days when great profits were

made by large and important classes in the community may be over. There may

lie and there probably are great inventions yet to be discovered, as great possibly

enable it to bear on its surface a population far more numerous and yet, on the

whole, more prosperous than has ever yet, at any previous period in our history,

--been numbered within the four seas. But yet there does seem a pause perhaps

only for the time-- in the progress of several branches of industrial labour; and
we may be not very remote from, if we are not already entering- into, the con-

dition termed by economists the non-progressive state. I do not dread this con-
Wedition for our country, should it arrive.
                                             may, under it, by a judicious adapt-

ation of habits to the circumstances of the case, be powerful, prosperous, and

respected by our neighbours. Countries in this condition have gone on for years in

great prosperity, supporting their population in a state of marked comfort. But
when they have done so, it has been by a distinct acceptance on the part of the

popular mind of obedience to the common virtues of thrift and foresight which

liave been too long neglected among us. Here is a practical field of great

usefulness for the economic student to occupy. Some have already laboured in

it. It will be far better for our population if they can be brought to antici-

pate what must result from such a state of matters, rather by calm reasonino-

than by the stern teaching of necessity. This is one point of the application

of the art of economics which may be very usefully followed out in a scientific

spirit.

     There is another position of a most useful character which may well be occupied,

which requires knowledge somewhat of a different order. It is remarkable, at the

present time, how little foreign economic writers are studied in this country. You
may read through the works of more than one recent English wiiter on economic

subjects almost without being aware that there existed any authors dealing with

the subject except those who employed the English language. There does'^ exist,

however, as I_ need hardly mention, a very copious and valuable literature, the

work of Continental scientific writers, which we might do well to explore and

-- --to master. Some foreign writers or, at least, some of their works have been

translated into English. Thus, the very usefiJ ' Guide to the Study of Political

Economy,' by Dr. Luigi Cossa,' has been translated from Italian into English, and
has been published here, with a preface by the late Professor Jevons. Again, the
two valuable volumes of the 'Principles of Political Economy,'- by Professor
Wilhelm Roscher, have been translated into English, and are a welcome addition

to our- stocl{ of information. This work is rendered, and very ably too, into
English. I must confess that it is a matter of some regret to me that this transla-

tion has proceeded from an American source. Not that I would grudge my fellow-

students in the United States the distinction of the work ; but I well remember
the difficulties which environed a proposed translation in England, which I sought

to carry out, and that the matter was dropped, those difficulties for the time proving

too great to be surmounted. I hope that greater interest in these subjects might
be felt now. I think that if some intelligent students of economics in this countrv
would attempt a series of translations from tlie works of foreign writers, not ye*t

known here, they might do themselves and the science itself a service. Something

has been done in this direction, but there is still a wide field to occupy. I may

quote, in saying this, a passage very much to the point from Professor Jevons'

preface to Dr. Luigi Cossa's Guide,' which I have just mentioned :

    ' Every economist would grant that we have in English the works of the father
of the science, Adam Smith, and of not a few successors or predecessors who have
made the science almost an English science. But this fact, joined perhaps witli
the common want of linguistic power in English students, has led our economic
writers to ignore too much the great works of the French and Italian economists,

as well as the invaluable recent treatises of German writers. The survey of the

foreign literature of the subject given in this " Guide " will enable the English

    ' Guide to the Sttidij of Political Economy. By Dr. Luigi Cossa. London : Mac-
millan & Co.

student to fix the bearings of the point of knowledge wliich he has reached, and to
estimate the fraction of the ocean of economic literature which he has been able to

traverse.'

To take a third point. Every successive generation, perhaps almost every decade,

Alis, as a ru.le, occupied with some particular bi-anch of economic thought.  short

. time since Free Trade was the economic point occupying the thoughts of all.

Everything almost was referred to a Free Trade standard, and was judged accord-

ingly. For a long period, also, there came into prominence the great doctrine of
laisse>faire. The late Professor Jevons, who joined to vast logical and analytical

powers of mind a vigorous common sense, which perceived as it were by intuition
that when once an economic doctrine of that class became separated from the sphere

of practical application it ran a great risk of becoming entirely vague and indefinite,
has done more than anyone else to mark out the limits within which that doctrine

should be applied. After this the relation of Socialism to economic teaching be-

came, and is now, one of the important questions of the day.

The vigorous periodical literature of the time, which has taken the place held

 by pamphlets to our fathers and grandfathers, supplies a fairly good test of the

.

 subjects which occupy the public mind ; and it is a proof of the prominence now

given to Socialism that the numbers published in April last of the ' Contemporary

Review,' the ' Fortnightlj^,' and the * Nineteenth Century,' all three contained

articles bearing on this subject, as did also the July number of ' Macmillau's

Magazine.' Those in the ' Oontemporaiy ' and the ' Fortnightly ' were written by
M. Emile de Laveleye, the eminent Belgian economist ; that in the ' Nineteenth

Century' was written by the Rev. Samuel A. Barnett, a well-known hard-worldng

clergyman in the east of London the article in ' iMacmillan's Magazine ' was
                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

written by Mr. Fawcett as a chapter in the new edition of his ' Manual of Political

Economy.' The views of the subject presented by these writers differ greatly,

as may be imagined, from each other. ^I. de Laveleye presents to us the aspect
under which Socialism appears on the Continent. He admits that the material

condition of the popidation is preferable to what it was in the ISIiddle Ages, but

he looks with great uneasiness to the state of matters in an age in which compe-

tition rules everythiug. General dissatisfaction with his lot is the result, ]\L de

Laveleye thinks, to everyone, with a feehng of want of security as to the future.
It is not the case that the condition of working men is worse than it was for-

merly. They have benefited from the greater cheapness of manufactured goods,

they are in many places better housed, they are generally better clothed, and their

furniture is better. But it is the sight of the inequalities existing in modern life,

the loosening of the ties which formerly united class with class, which induces the

J)itterness of feeling closely allied with Socialism, Anarchy, and Nihilism, and

--·causes the desire for ' the destruction of everything, states and churches, with all

their institutions and their laws religious, political, judicial, financial, educational,

--or social ' like the ' Fifth Monarchy Men,' whom we read of during the darkest

years of the Commonwealth. Universal destruction is the watchword of this party,

that a new world may be built on the rums.

M. de Laveleye, while commenting on these matters, does not apprehend any

Immediate danger to the present social order, imless one of those great crises takes

.place in which there is a general collapse of power, such as occurred after the break-

up of the late Empu-e in France. The world saw then what the deeds of the Com-
jaoiune were. May it be long before such an outburst of crime is witnessed again.
!But when we consider the existing condition of affairs among the principal nations

6f Europe, the severe strain of forced military service, the heavy demands on the

means of the people to meet the requirements of the crushing debts, national as

well as local, the vast budgets, out of proportion to the benefits received therefrom

"by the people who pay the taxes, and the increasing weakness of administrative

-- --power :much as one may regi'et that such turbulence of spirit exists one cannot

·wonder that it should spring up. This is a rough sketch of the view presented by

M. de Laveleye.

In our own country these questions usually take a milder form : though I could

ifind expressions of opinion as strong, or nearly as strong, to lay before you, as those
            TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.                   611

myjust quoted. But I prefer to take for  instance the gentler type of opinion as

slio-mi in tlie article by the Rev. Samuel Barnett in the ' Nineteenth Century ' to

which I have referred. England is, perhaps I should say, has been, honourably

distinguished as a country in which the ' falsehood of extremes ' is instinctively

Wefelt.  have here no crushing conscription, no inordinate pressure of taxation.

Hitherto we have fortunately escaped these things, and may, by the exercise of

common sense, hope to do so in future. Mr. Barnett feels this. His recommenda-

tions include a wiser administration of the Poor Laws, so as to enable a distinc-

tion to be drawn between the man who had kept clear of parish relief up to a
reasonable age, and the man who had not. This, and a wider application of the

principle of the Artisans' Dwellings Act and the Libraries Act, are amongst the

principal of his recommendations. They come to this, that the old age of the
honest working man should be made secure against distressing want or degrading

relief, and that the power of obtaining rational pleasures should be provided for him

within reasonable bounds. Some will think this would be going too far. The

Howquestion for the economist to consider is.  far can it be granted without

impairing the great principle of self-help ? This is a point too frequently ignored
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

but when I consider the condition of many of our worlring classes, their prospects

in this country, and the openings which our colonies and the United States promise

to energetic industry, I think we must be prepared to offer better terms than we

hitherto have done to those who continue to dwell here.

Legislation, conceived in a somewhat similar spirit, has recently been deter-

mined on in the German Empire ; and if the iron spirit of Prince Bismarck has

felt it needful to yield this concession to popular feeling, it would not seem im-

probable that other statesmen may have, willingly or otherwise, to travel in the

same road.

There are limits, however, to the application of this class of payments by the

State which must be borne in mind. And Mr. Fawcett in his article in ' Macmillan's

Magazine,' which deals with the thorny subjects of State Socialism and the Nation-

alisation of the Land, is careful to enforce this warning. The real incentive to labour

and economy is individual interest, and we must be carefid not to break down

the force of that power, the mainspring of progress; nor to lose sight of the great

--principle previously referred to which not a little in recent legislation and public

feeling has powerfully tended to impair--that self-help is beyond aU question and

comparison the best help.

I have in these observations only marked out some of the limits of this wide

subject. The question how far the principles usually included under the de-

nomination of Socialism should or shoidd not be taken into consideration by the

State is one which our economists woidd do well to consider. Economic teaching is

sometimes termed hard and cruel by those who do not comprehend its scope,

because some of the warnings it gives do not fall in with the sickly slaclmess

of popular sentiment. This is most unjust. Other branches of study are not

spoken of in the same manner. The surgeon is not termed cruel because he

recommends an operation which, though painfid, is essential to life ; because he
shows that the neglect of certain precautions wiU be followed by suflering,

perhaps by death. The economist, who sees that the happiness of the community

can only be secured by causing individuals to submit to restraints which are

irksome and perhaps painful, should not be termed cruel for pointing out what is

essential to the general well-being. He is, in this, entirely within the scope of
Ahis duty.
            community which is not prosperous can scarcely possess all the

elements essential for happiness.

     I have endeavoured to indicate in these remarks both some of the directions in

which I think that economists may labour with advantage, and the principles on

which their labours should be conducted. Economic science, like all other branches

of science, is governed by certain laws. These laws must be adhered to, though it

may not be possible to affirm of them that they are always more than relatively

true._ But the question of relative truth opens the door to a far wider field of

inquiry, the threshold of which I must not cross.

    If I may for one moment in concluding diverge from the stricter mode of

                                   ER2

thought which I have sought to follow, I may claim for economic teaching

that it is the natural utterance of the most fervent patriotism, and possesses the

sanction even of a more serious authority. It was not, we may be sure, with-

out wise deliberation that the authors of the noble English liturgy, following in

this older forms of religion, included among its formularies a supplication that
the monarch may study to preserve the people in wealth, taking the word in its
widest sense, among other blessings. Without the means of well-founded pros-
perity there is no permanence for a nation. In listening to or departing from the
teachings of economic truth lies the choice between the paths which lead to wealth
or to want, to death or to life. Some may say there are higher aims even than

--these. To them I may quote the words of one of our deepest thinkers ' the

virtue of prosperity is temperance, the virtue of adversity is fortitude.' It is

the glory of economic teaching, while pointing out the methods by which pros-

perity may be secured, never to lose sight of the principles by which temperance

is attained, and temperance is essential to fortitude, able to resist the hasty

gusts of popular feeling, able also to warn the powerful when that feeling is well

founded.

     Ill will it be for England if, in times of movement, tliis temperance, this more
than golden moderation, benot unwaveringly held in mind and observed. "Well will

same latitude as London, while Toronto is on the parallel of Florence. The size is

Newdifficult to understand, but the facts that                                                      Brunswick is nearly as large as

Ireland, and that Montreal is 333 miles from Toronto, give a rough and ready

scale of size and distance. From the Straits of Belleisle a schooner can pass

throuo-h Canadian waters to Port Arthur on Lake Superior, a distance of 2,300

miles. The character and demeanour of Canadians is unhke that of citizens of

the United States, but it is very un-English too. In an English country town or

villao'e the man of the lower or lower middle class has no influence in the working

of the ordinary political, parochial, or religious life, but the same man in Canada is

soon taught to feel that he has a voice in the municipal government of the country,

and finds himself in an atmosphere saturated with politics. lie is probably in a

position to earn a good living, but if he misuses his chances there is no Poor Law

to fall back on ; broadly speaking, the State does not stand between a man and

starvation, and there is no class to be compared with the 800,000 persons receiving

parish relief in Great Britain. In each district of Canada there is a carefully

arranged municipal system which works in with the Provincial Government, as

that again supplements the Dominion Go\ernment. Education is managed by the

Provincial Government. The school is practically free to all, and the education on

the whole is good ; considering the distances over which popidation in Ontario is

scattered, it is surprising to find that only 2 per cent, of children of school age are

returned as not attending any school. The new licence law fixes 4 per 1,000 as

the maximum number of licences, and one more for every additional 500 inhabitants;

hut the inhabitants of any polling subdivision have the power of preventing the

issue of any particular licence, or, by a three-fourths majority, the issue of any at

all. Taverns are closed at 11 p.m. ; on Saturdays at 7 r.M. Spirits have been the

common drink of Canada, but the amount consumed has declined from 5 gallons

Hto gallon per head, and lager beer is taldng the place of spirits. The revenue

of Canada for the year ending June 30, 1883, will be about ,^35,600,000. To
this, the Consolidated Fund revenue, may be added some ,^1,500,000 derived from

land sales : or a total of ,§'37,000,000. The expenditnre will have been about

;Jfi'8,600,000. This does not look like banln-uptcy. The total value of imports for

the year ending June 30, 1882, was ;S1 19,000,000, and of exports, ^^102,000,000.

I^ist year, 67,000,000 letters passed through the Post Office ; the deposits in

savings banks were ^13,700,000, and the withdrawals only ,^10,000,000. There

are 1,260,000 tons of shipping on the Dominion register; the fish products of 1882

were worth ,^17,000,000, and the exports of agricultm-al produce amounted to

,^'35,000,000. When the Dominion was first organised the construction of the

Intercolonial railway from Quebec to Halifax and St. John, New Brunswick, was

an essential condition of the terms of union ; and when the Dominion stretched out

to absorb the little-known prairie and take in British Columbia, a trans- continental

railway through British territory became a paramount necessity. Its construction

--within ten years was promised to British Columbia when she entered the Con-

federation a promise which could not be fulfilled, though the Government set to

work at once on surveys and on the construction of two important sections ; but
at length men were found who formed the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, and

uirdertook the responsibihty of financing tlie vast scheme, and sui-mounting the

physical obstacles ; the length of the main line from Montreal to the Pacific coast

will be 2,875 miles ; of this the Government have built or are building 650 miles,

and 1,450 of the remaining 2,220 miles will be completed b}' the Company before

the end of the season. It opens up a prairie which is, both as regards surface and

fertihty, as varied as it is vast. There is an immense extent of land which will

grow for years without manure                                                                                   25  to  35 bushels of wheat per acre                                                                                                                                      and there are

They have thus as good or better land for settlement in Canada than in the States

and instead of immigrants, or their own inhabitants, bemg tempted to the Western

States, they will retain their own population and keep imder British rule those

leaving the old country. Immigration in itself serves as an encouragement to

their home manufactures, but on this delicate point it need only be said that

Canada's fiscal pohcy has not been hurtful to England. Imports from Great

Britam were ,g:37,400,000 in 1878, and had risen to ^50,500.000 in 1882, while

     The author commenced with a brief sketch of the early history of the
Dominion from the time of its discovery by Cabot, tracing the rise of French
influence, and the aggrandising policy which led to its clashing with British

interests in other settlements. By the treaty of 1763 the whole country came

finally under British sway, and its subsequent history is mainly occupied by
the attempts at the confederation of its various provinces. These are (1) Lower

is 3i million square miles, equal in extent to the whole of Europe. The Con-
federation, commenced by an Act of ParUament in 1807, embraced iu 1872 all the
provinces with the exception of Newfoundland, which still remains aloof. Canada

in its climate reaches greater degrees of heat and cold than Europe, the ther-
mometer ranging between 36° and 102° Fahr. The prevailing winds are N.E.,
N.W., and S.W. ; and its pleasantest season the autumn, late in which what

is known as the 'Indian Summer' occurs. The lakes are both numerous and

important, several being over 1,000 miles in circumference, and iu parts unfathom-

able.

     The author gave a description of some of the principal rivers, including the
St. Lawrence, the Ottawa, the Saguenay, and the Saskatchawan. It is estimated

that the solid content of the first of these is 1,547,792,360,000 cubic feet, which

would form a cube of water 22 miles ou each side. The curious formation of the
bed of the Saguenay river, which lies 600 feet below that of the St. Lawrence
at their juncture, was also adverted to.

  - Canada contains thirty-seven cities with populations exceeding 5,000. Quebec,
formerly the first in this particular, is now surpassed hj both Montreal aud

Toronto, but continues, from its situation, the chief shipping port of the Dominion.

Montreal (Mont FCoyal) was formerly the depot of the fur trade ; it has now,
among other buildings of importance, tliat monument of railway enterprise, the
Victoria Bridge. Toronto, the old capital of Upper Canada, is now the second

city of the Dominion, aud from its rapid rate of progression promises soon to take
the first position. It is the great centre of the West of Canada Railways.

     The agricultural statistics show an increase of landowners during the last half
century, which must be compared with other newly settled countries, smce in
accordance with the Old World rate of progression it cfiuld only be denominated

'marvellous.' In 1831 there were 57,801 proprietors, while in 1881 the number
was 588,973, and the acres owned, 67,645,162, by far the greater number of which

were in plots coutaiuing between 50 and 200. The yield of wheat in 1880 was

over 32j million bushels : of barley, over 16j million bushels ; of oats, 70i million

bushels                                     potatoes, over 55 million bushels ; turnips, nearly 40                                                                      million bushels : and
                                         ;

apples, over 13 million bushels. Butter was made to the extent of 103 million

povmds ; and maple sugar to that of 20^ million pounds, whilst the retm-ns of honey,
cheese, home-spun cloth, flannel, and linen testify to the extraordinary industry of
a by no means large population. The statistics of live stock show that in 1881

there were in stock enough sheep to provide for two years' consumption, cattle for

nearly four, and swine for one.

The following table shows the magnitude of the export cattle trade of Canada

and its increase of late years :

    The swine are now slaughtered and salted before being exported. One other-

branch of Canadian industry, the lishing-, has been rendered of prominent interest,
not only from its inherent value, but from the disputes it has occasioned. Under

the AVashington Treaty the GoYemment of the United States were adjudged to

pay an annual rental of 100,000Z. for the right of free fishing in Canadian waters,
ani the value of the catch to the colonists in the year 1882 was over 3^ million,
exclusive of that in Manitoba and the North-West territories, from which there -
are no retiu'us. The United States and Great Britain are the largest consumers of
Canadian fish, in the catching of which 60,053 men and 31,574 ships and boats
are employed. With over a million square miles of timber land to be reduced,
the lumbering trade, which includes all operations from felling and rafting to

sawing and shipping, may be considered one of the most important in the Dominion.

British (Columbia alone in 1880 is reported to have produced 200 milKon feet of

prepared timber, the greater part of which was exported to California.

     In mineral wealth Canada has not ranked very high at present, although its

reputed gold deposits attracted its first settlers as far back as 1576. Much
remains to be done in the way of facilitating conveyance before the richest region,
the Rocky Mountain section of British Columbia, is opened up. In 1882 the

returns  gave  for  gold, 70,015  oimces ;  silver, 87,024  ounces ;  iron,  223,057  tons
                                                                                                        ;

coal, 1,307,824 tons ; and crude petroleum, 15,490,622 gallons. Salt, fortunately

for the fishing industry, is found in large quantities, as also is granite and building

stone.

     The consideration of the fur trade occupies us more with the past than the
present ; with the reign of Charles II., and the rivalries of the Hudson's Bay and
the North-Western Companies, than with that of Victoria. It is decreasing rapidly,
the exports in 1871 bemg valued at ;^1,63.3,501, while those in 1881 are but

;^987,555.

     The author, quitting the consideration of the natm-al productions, then touched

upon the prominent manufactiu'ing industries. He showed that the amount of

capital invested had increased between 1871 and 1881 from nearly 78 million

dollars to over 165 million, that the aggregate value of productions had increased
from 221| million dollars to nearly 310 million, and that the number of persons
employed had increased in the decade fi-om 187,942 to 254,935, and their average
wage from 217 dollars to 233 per annum.

    As may be conjectured, Canada, as a maritime nation, takes a foremost position

only four other countries in the world possessing a larger mercantile marine.

During the last three years, however, this important source of national wealth has
shown signs rather of retrogression than of advancement. In 1878 the total
number of vessels registered in the Dominion was 7,469, with a tonnage of
1,333,015 tons, whilst in 1881 the number was but 6,412, and the tonnage but

1,156,941 tons. It must not, however, be imagined that trade has in any way fol-
lowed in the wake of shipping the following returns for the same period showing

                                                                                                                                                                          ;

616 REPOKT-- 1883.

The population of Canada, wliicli in 1871 was 3,035,024, had in 1881 reached

4,324,810, being an increase in the ten years at tlie I'ate of 18'98 per cent. Of
these the French settlers were in a considerable majority, the remainder being

Irish, English, Scotch, Germans, Indians, and Africans. The averages of all the

provinces give 1-24 persons to a square mile; 513-8 acres to a person; and 503

acres of unoccupied land to a person. The married numbered 1,380,044; the
widowed 160,330; and the unmarried (mostly children), 2,784,396. The propor-
tion of sexes is now nearly equal. According to religious denominations the

population is divided into many sections. The Roman Catholics are by far the

largest body, having 1,791,982 members, and the Presbyterians next, with 676,155,
while Pagans can boast of 4,478, and Unitarians close the list with 2,634.

There is no State Church in the Dominion. The emigrants who are daily

thronging into the country seem in their social status to be undergoing change
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

formerly there were many more labourers, fewer mechanics, and also more farmers.

     The climate of Canada, as the author pointed out, renders railways a necessity

and, after alluding to the various lines in progress, he summed up, in the following

figures, their present position :

The canal system, so necessary for the navigation of rivers containing rapids, as

do most of                                    those in  Canada, is now being superseded                                                by railways                                                 the decrease  in
                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

passengers during the past five years being nearly 36,000 per annum, and the tons

of freight being nearly 200,000 per annum.

The school laws, though varying in the provinces of Quebec and Ontario,

provide for the efficient education of the rising generation, the returns showing

that nearly the whole population between the ages of five and sixteen are attend-

ing school. In 1797 a grant of 500,000 acres of unoccupied lands was set apart

for the establishment and endo^vment of a university and four foundation grammar

schools. Among the items of educational outlay is included that of the post

oflSce ; and here the author, in concluding, showed how greatly, and with what

rapid strides, the system in Canada had advanced. The number "of letters carried
in 1868 was 18,000,000; owing mainly to a reduction in the rate, in 1870 it bad
increased to 24,600,000, and in 1882 to 56,200,000, whilst the package post had .
kept pace with that of the letter. The revenue was over ^^2,000,000, and the
expenditure nearly ^^2,500,000, this being (as the author pointed out) owing
to the cost of conveyance in unsettled districts. Since June 1, 1882, newspapers

--and periodicals printed and published in Canada, and posted from the office of

publication, have been carried free a step very obviously in advance of any
European nation.

             4. On the Number of the Deaf and Dumb in the World.
                                By William E. A. Axon.

   A rigidly acciirate estimate of the total number of human beings incapable of

speech is impossible. Many congenital deaf mutes will escape classification in

their earliest years, as parents will not recognise the unpleasant truth until doubt
is no longer possible. The proportion of deaf-mutes to the ordinary population
varies in different countries, but appears to be on the average about one in every

fifteen hundred. Taking this as the basis minimum, Guyot in 1842, when the
                                                                                                                                                                ;;

                                                                                                      TRAMSACTIONS OF SECTION F.                                617

population of the globe was supposed to be 850,000,000, considered tbat the

number of deaf-mates then living was 600,000.' Since that date there has been

a large increase of population, and in the extent of our knowledge as to the number

of tlie dwellers upon the earth. Messrs. Behm and Wagner in 1875 estimated the

population of the earth to be 1,396,843,000.^ Accordingly, in the following year,

taking the figure at fourteen hundred millions, the present writer, accepting the

proportion previously employed by Guyot, calculated the deaf-mutes in the world

to be 933,01)0.°' It seems to be desirable to renew such estimates from time to

time, as they are useful and convenient, if it be remembered that they should only

be regarded as roughly approximating to the probable facts of the case. The latest

detailed estimate of the population of the globe is that given by Mr. H. P.

Hubbard.                                                           In this estimate the important results of the latest of the American
                                                                '

census and similar recent enumerations are included. Mr. Hubbard calculates

Wethe total population of the globe to be 1,623,178,161.                                                                                            may therefore suppose

that the number of deaf-mutes in the world is now 1,082,132. Supposing they

were all congregated, the city of silence would be more than twice the size of

Manchester and its immediate districts.

                                                                   5. On the Palestine Channel and Canal Scheme.
                                                                             By Cornelius Walford, F.S.S.

The author clairned for the question of the Palestine Canal consideration

rather as of national import, than as belonging to the region of party politics, and

traced the financial history of the present canal, showing that, though constructed at
a nominal cost of 19,000,000 sterling, the sum of 52,000,000, or as ' some Avell-

informed people ' think, 70,000,000 sterling, has been the probable expenditure

that of this nominal capital England, at a cost of over 4,000,000/., has secured

one-sixth of the shares, which, though now bearing interest at only 5 per cent.,

will in_ 1894 receive the regular dividends ; and that in return for this large financial

stake in the undertaking, this country possesses in the control but 22 votes

against an unlimited numter of French ones. The tolls exacted are lOfrs. per

ton of cargo and lOfrs. per passenger, plus pilotage dues ; and to the aggregate

collected, British ships contribute 80 per cent., against 9 per cent. French and

4 per cent. Dutch, whilst the value of our shipping passing annually through the

·canal is 12,000,000/., and that of the cargoes they carry not less thaii 40,000,000/.
The existing canal is about 100 miles long ; from 190 to 320 feet wide on the surface,
and 72 feet at bottom, and 26 feet deep. The block system is employed invits

navigation                                                         the grounding of                   a vessel causes the immediate cessation of the traffic
                                                   ;

in both directions                                                                                    all vessels, unless  on  mail  service, have  to  anchor  during the
                                                                                                   ;

                       ;

of pilots and the obstruction of dredging machines, a passage which could be easily

accomplished in seventeen hours takes on an average forty hours, and frequently

much longer.

While admitting the advantages of this waterway, which has reduced the

sailing distance to Ceylon by one-half, and to Bombay by more than one-third,

the fact is becoming every day more apparent that the canal is inadequate to the

demands of British commerce alone. In answer to the question. What is to be

done ? four remedies have been suggested, of which two principally received the

author's attention. The first of these, viz., a second canal alongside the existmg

one, has gained the approbation of the British Government. This, however, re-

quires ' an outlay, by way of loan to the existing company, of 8,000,000 sterling at
3^ per cent, interest.' The right of control also is to remain in the same hands

and tlioiigh a considerable reduction is to be made in pilotage and other transit

dues, this is to take place only on an increase of the dividends to 21 and 23 per
cent., which cannot be in the near future, seeing that the increased charges laid on
the capital account (for interest on borrowed capital and the provision of a sinking
fund), will materially affect them.

     The second scheme adverted to is the one known as the ' Palestine Channel,'
by which it is proposed to join the Mediterx'anean and Red Seas by means of the
Jordan Valley connected with these respective seas by short canals. The canal
commencing at the head of the Gulf of Akabah (the northern and shorter horn of the
Red Sea) would be cut througli a district partly marsh partly mountain, of 42 miles

long, to the southern extremity of the Jordan Valley, and thence the remarkable
depression, 1,.jOO feet, in which lies the Dead Sea, would provide it with a natural,
convenient, and inexpensive bed of nearly 100 miles in length, and with a width of
between 3 and 10 miles. Through this valley, from the Lake of Tiberias to the

Dead Sea now flows the river Jordan, and towards its northern end another valley

branches out in a north-westerly direction, and pro^·ides a suitable situation for a

canal as far as the plain of Esdraelon, across which a cutting may be continued
(taking advantage of the little River Kishon) 25 miles long, into the Bay of Acre

and the Mediterranean Sea. This bay, as well as that of Akabah, are of good
depth, require few engineering aids to render them navigable, and are naturally
well protected. In all, as far as can be ascertained by the imperfect surveys
already made, the canal must be 200 miles long, 65 of these requiring to be
cut ; and Tiberias and some 300 square miles of land must be submerged at a cost
for compensation estimated at 1,000,000/. In touching on the political aspect of
the question the author declared himself in favour of a Universal Protectorate.
Until the proper surveys are completed no estimate can be made as to cost, but the
author was strongly of opinion that the scheme presented no insuperable difficulties,
and woidd eventually prove one of the greatest triumphs gained in the cause of
commerce.

6. The English-speaJcinfj Pojndations of the World. By Hthe Clarke.

Mr. Clarke proceeded to consider the weight of the elements contributing ta

the influence of the English language and the populations which speak it in rela-

tion to the late censuses. The census of 18S0 for the United States had given a

figure of 50,000,000 ; that of these islands in 1881 35,000,000. Including other

portions of the empire he made a total of 100,000,000 of English-spealdng people.

He observed that the phrase English-speaking had latterly superseded that of

Anglo-Saxon, the object being to get rid of possible jealousies of race, and to place

the basis of unity on language, as the expression of common culture and

common institutions. He illustrated the gradual gi-owth of the English-speaking

populations iu the North American regions of Canada, the United States, and West

Indies at the respective censuses. The total had risen from 6,000,000 in 1800 to

56,000,000 in 1880. The consequence was not only a great expansion in this

region, but a displacement of the relative proportions between North America and

these islands. In 1800 North America stood 6,000,000 against 16,000,000 here

in 1850 the proportions were abont equal, but since then the preponderance of

America has been increasing, and now the figures are 56,000,000 against our

35,000,000. This must be the forerunner of a greater movement as the literary

status of America advances. The effect of literature and journalism in promoting

the common sympathy which has of late manifested itself throughout the popula-

Ations was referred to, as well as the establishment of a more cordial feeling.

        2. On the Effect of Alcoholic Drlnlcs on Length of Human lAfe.
                           By W. Braham Robinson, B.N.

     Since the Roman PrEetorian prefect Ulpianus wrote on the value of life, facts
 have been accumulating which admit of the expectation of human life being more
 correctly estimated than in his day, though much has yet to be learned.

      Before the art of printing was discovered, it was of importance, with the view
 of discoveries in art and science being followed up, that men should livelong; and
 now the true value of long and healthy lives cannot be overrated, even from an

 economist's point of view.

      In this day some insurance societies show that longevity can be increased by

 simply not drinking, as beverages, intoxicating drinks.
       There are several mutual life assurance societies which keep the statistics of the

 lives of the general section and of those persons who abstain from strong drinks
· quite separate, and some of the facts kindly furnished to the author by these in-
. stitutions he quotes, bearing in mind that many dithculties at present present them-

  selves in this inquiry which, no doubt, will be eliminated in future years, such as

 the time the several abstainers insured may Jiave ceased to drink alcoholic liquors,

. and the quantity and kind they took during the period or periods they were not

  abstainers.

       The most valuable facts are furnished by the United Kingdom Temperance and
  General Provident Institution, established in 1840, which institution on December
  31, 1874, had 9,539 whole life policies in the temperance section and 15,838 in the

. general.

   4. On the Introduction of Science into Higlier and Middle-class ScJwols.
                               By D. Mackintosh, F.G.S.

     The author remarked that the main object of education was not so much to
make better men of business as to make men of business better men. He referred
to the improvement which had latelj- taken place in public schools as regarded the

introduction of scientific subjects in addition to chemistry and physics. Dm'ing

his travels in the West of England he had found that principals of private boys'
schools had seldom found it practicable to introduce scientific subjects in addition
to chemistry, but stated that he had found exceptions in Southport, several towns
and villages in Cheshire, in Grove Park, Wrexham, &c. The author had found
that in the West of England many ladies' schools, as regarded the teaching of

science, had rather deteriorated than improved, and referred to the prominence

formerly given in school advertisements to the ' use of the globes.' He had like-

wise found that, contrary to the general impression, more time was devoted to
science in private than in public ladies' schools, though exceptions to this rule in
the north-west of England might be found in the Liverpool College for Girls, the

Queen's School, Chester, and other places. He had been led to regard the teaching

of science in joint-stock companies' high schools for girls as partaking more of show
than reality, though to this rule there were exceptions. As regarded the qualifica-
tions of teachers, he believed that the mere circumstance of having passed an
examination, or of having received a certificate, was of secondary importance, and
that to be able to teach science successfully a teacher ought to go through a special
process of self-training in the art of teaching ; in other words, he ought to be able,
without books or notes, by illustrations, to simplify and render attractive what he
taught, so as to impart to his pupils a taste for original scientific research. As

regarded the selection of subjects, the author believed that chemistiy, physics, or
other experimental sciences, however important in themselves, were not without

defects from an educational point of view, because many pupils after leaiing school
were unable to continue the study of these subjects through a want of sufiicient

apparatus, whereas the study of the natural sciences could be successfully pursued

after leaving school, during ordinary occupations. The author had found that
geology was the most important science as regarded mental training, not only on
account of the magnitude and variety of its subjects, but because it appealed more
than any other science to the facidty of wonder, and thereby iiTesistibly led to the

exercise of the reasoning powers.

   5. The Importance of a Creed Census ; loith Notice of that talcen in 1881

           for the Diocese of Liverpool. By the Rev. Canon Hume.

     The year 1851 was the year for the decennial Government census, and it was the
desire of a large number that the schedules should contain a place for recording the
religious professions of the people. But there were others who objected to this
proposal, mainly on the ground that there were many who worshipped in Non-
conformist Chapels on the evening of Sunday, who yet claimed to belong to the

Established Cliurcli. In tliat year therefore a census of religious worship was

suggested and obtained, but nothing of the kind has been tried since.

In 1861 a very numerous and important deputation waited on LordPalmerston,

who admitted that he thoroughly concurred in the propriety of having a Creed

Census, but stated that the Government could not aftbrd to give offence to a large

number of their supporters. In 1871 and 1881 the matter seemed to be given up,

and no prominent agitation took place on the subject.

But in 1881 the new Diocese of Liverpool was constituted, and a new Bishop

was consecrated and set apart for it. It appeared therefore to be an unusually

opportune period for making a census according to creed, apart from the Govern-

ment altogether.

To this proposal all the usual objections were made, as that it was uncalled for,

and the GoTernment had not thought it necessary ; that it would be a very ex-

pensive  undertaking ;  that  the  people would  not  reply to  our  inquiries                                           that  the
                                                                                                                      ;

results would not be authoritative, however honestly procured ; and that people

would not give credit to the results when they had been obtained. To all this it'can

now be replied that not one of the objections urged turned out to be true, and that

the whole diocese was carefully enumerated, people of all classes and creeds kindly

and courteously affording their aid ; that the labour was spread over a period of about

nine months, and was mainly in the hands of a few trained and trustworthy enume-

rators. The city was first completed, and as it was found to contain more than

one half the population of the diocese, the incumbents in the more distant parts did

not press their objections.

The result for the city was as follows :

  ....Church of England
  ....Dissenters and others

  .....Roman Catholics

  ....Religion unknown

                                   Total .             . 499,042. = 100

     These were the parochial or resident people only, but the Government census,

which included non-residents who merely slept in the city on a particular night,
amounted to 53,383 more, of whom a large number were sailors, travellers,

tramps, &c.

     For the whole diocese the numbers were as follows :

    ....Church of England

              Dissenters and others

    ....Roman Catholics
    ....Religion unknown

                                   Total

     This leaves 71,131 or 6-5 per cent, for the ' floating population,' the Government
census amounting to 1,084,884. As the possibility and facility of obtaining such a
census has thus been demonstrated in reference to so large a percentage of the gross
population, it is to be hoped that in future the benefits of it will be extended to
England and AVales, as they are already to Ireland and the colonies.

and especially to the papers of Mr. Giffen and Mr. Gosclien on the fall of prices,

it was pointed out that the index-numbers hitherto compiled were liable to criticism

as failing to comply with the conditions that (1) they should start on a fair average

of prices (2) that they shoidd include every class of goods, and also of ser\-ices

article should be scheduled twice in different stages of manufacture ; and that

(4) each article should be rated at a figure proportionate to its consumption. As

to the pi'oduction and consumption of gold, statistics on these points were of all

others uncertain and subject to correction, but it appeared tolerably certain that

the gold circulation per head in the United Kingdom was larger in 1883 than in

1844, while credit in the shape of bank-balances was enormously larger ; in all

probability both the public and the banks were in a stronger position now to meet
Aany call on their resources.
                                 true index-number, could it be ascertained, would

probably show that the apparent large decrease in prices was subject to considerable

modification, and the rise in the value of Consols and other first-rate securities,

which Mr. Goschen had shown to be unatFected by any reduction or augmentation

of prices, was probably in a great measure due to the increased wealtli of the

country, which enabled capitalists to take a lower rate of interest for their money,

without curtailing their income. Granting the fall in price of many commodities,

and assuming the quality to have remained unchanged, on the other hand rents,

rates, &c., had notoriously risen, so had salaries and wages of all kinds, and the

amount payable, in one way or another, for ' services rendered' entered very largely

into the sum-total of our expenditure. The recipients of these higher wages had

probably enforced a higher standard of minimum comfort, and were living in

better houses, -wnth better drainage, water supply, &c. The compensation for this

must be sought in the more efficient returns in labour for wages i-eceived, a more

numerous and more thriving population, and greater wealth to the community

generally. In the words of Mr. Gifien, the only outlet from the situation was the

gradual adjustment of prices which must arise from increasing wealth of popu-

lation of gold-using countries.

               4. Method of Measuring Changes in the Value of Gold.

                                      By J. L. Shadwell.

    The common method of measuring changes in the value of money by the prices

of commodities is an unsatisfiictoiy one. Instead of being concentrated on the
causes which are peculiar to the precious metals, the attention is distracted by the

midtiplicity of the causes aff'ecting the value of every commodity. Adam Smith's

proposal to make labour the measure of vahie, which has been ignored by later

writers, really affords a solution of the problem. Labour, not being a commodity,,

has no value of its own; but it enables us to measure the value of commodities,
since people will give more or less labour to procure an article, according as they
think it more or less W(jrth having.

   A comparison of the rates of agricultural wages in the different counties of

England in 1850 and 1882, shows that they Iiave risen on the average about fifty
per cent. This is equivalent to a fall of thirty-three per cent, in the value of gold;
for three oimces of gold will only induce people to perform the same amount of
labour as two otmces formerly would. The rise of prices during the same period
has been insignificant ; but this does not prove that gold has not fallen in value,

but simply that other things have fallen also. As the constant tendency of

industry is to reduce the cost of every product, it is not surprising that a fall of
thirty-three per cent, in the value of gold in the course of thirty years shoidd be
unaccompanied by any marke<l rise in prices. Indeed, if a general rise of prices is
insisted upon as the only satisfactory proof of a depreciation of gold, the fact of

depreciation will never be established.

        A2. System of Science Demonstration in Elementary Schools.
                       By W. Lant Carpenter, B.A., B.Sc.

     The subject of this paper is some of the results which have been obtained during-
the last few 3'ears by the system of science demonstrations first conceived and
elaborated by the Liverpool School Board, with the advice of Colonel Donelly, R.E.,
Professor Huxley, and others ; but worked out in greater detail, and possibly in
some respects more successfully, in Birmingham. The success in both places, how-

ever, has been so great, and the commendations of the system by eminent men who
have been made aware of it, have been so strong, as to lead to the belief that, were

it more widely known, it would be more generally adopted.

     The subjects of instruction at present are :--for boys, elementary physics ; for

girls, domestic economy, including elementary physics, chemistry, and physiology.

No child is admitted to the classes who has not passed Standard IV., but in the

Birmingham Schools, a well-arranged system of object lessons prepares the minds
of the younger children for the higher system. The essence of that system consists
(1) in the entire abandonment of text-books of any kind, the teaching being entirely
oral. (2)_ The employment of a specially-appointed expert, as a demonstrator,
(with assistants where necessary), who goes round from school to school with
apparatus, &c., repeating the same lesson iu each till all have been visited. (.3) The
encouragement of the children to take part in the demonstrations themselves, and
to write out notes of the lessons, which are re\ised by the demonstrator. (4) The-
establishment of a central laboratory, for practical work by advanced scholars, &c.

     As to results, the most important probably is the general quickening of the

intellectual life of the school. In Liverpool, in the three years prior to the intro-
duction of the system, the percentage of passes in ' the three R's ' averaged 74-4,

whUe in the five years succeeding its introduction, it averaged 87-8, or an"^ increase
actually of 13|, and proportionately of 18 per cent. Another advantage is, the
attraction of tlie attention of teachers to science properlv taught as a means of
education, and to this may be added the discovery of lads of exceptional scientific
ability, and the aid thus afibrded them. The actual value of the information given
and of the diftusion of a taste for science, are too obvious to need more than a-
mere mention.

          3. On the Education of Artisans.'^ By G. B. Bauron, M.D.

     The social economics of every country depend upon and are influenced by the
kind of training of the people. The character of every community is stamped with the
impress of its national education. All methods of education should aim to give

moral tone to the young to fit them for the battle of life. No education is efiective

without the aid of religion. The vast majority of the young do not obtain that in
their houies. The present standard of elementary teacldng is too high. Education
must not stop with the three R's, but must be pushed on by State aid to practical
and manual instruction in workshops provided to teach technology in order to
bring up our artisans to a level with those of other coimtries^in the art of

producing decorative fabrics.

     Art classes wherever established are doing a great work in bringing the poorer-

Weclasses face to face with knowledge otherwise out of their reach.      must raise

our artisans above the crime-laden floor of ignorance and pauperism, and secure,

by proper instruction for those who 'toil and spin,' the foremost place in tbe civilised

world as artificers. There is no national economy in ignorance and pauperism.

    The statistics prove large sums expended on national schools. We must not

stop here. Government must aid by frrants those artisans who are unable to pay

for advanced technical work, by placing them in national workshops containing all

the requirements to teach the industries of the country after passing a certain grade

in general education. The State should imitate tbe Whitworth scholarships, make

small grants of money to tbe poor class of artisans in aid of general elementary

as well as practical education, and encourage art and science teaching in every

place, and the Queen's prizes in elementry art and science classes must not be with-

drawn. The State to establish and supervise evening classes in connection with

colleges, mechanics' institutions, and kindred places, for teaching those who are

beyond the ordinary age of school life technology and cognate subjects.

4. Tlie True Reason tvliy so many Children try to avoid School Attendance.
                                By the Rev. Canon Hume.

     There has been a good deal of discussion of late respecting the causes of non-
attendance at school by a large number of the children of the poor. Those most

frequently assigned have been two in number, which may be called, (1) the bodily

weakness of the young, arising from deficient food or clothing, and from natural

delicacy of constitution; (2) the over-exercise of tbe brain and nervous system

from mental labour continued during many hours, to which home lessons are added,

and an insufficiency of healthy exercise and agreeable relaxation.

    There is no doubt that both these causes exist, and yet it appears to me that

they are very unimportant factors in the production of the result which is admitted.
The author's decided opinion, based upon a large experience, is that education is

not now made at all so interesting as it was before the Government undertook the
patronage of it. The fixing of rewards for the three subjects of reading, writing,

and arithmetic has led to an unhealthy pressure which has reallj' retarded progress

and disgusted the learners.
     For example, except in a few of our best schools, there is a constant effort to

teach reading, spelling being scarcely at all known, or rather almost utterly un-
known and instead of each pupil analysing and discovering every word for him-

                                  ;

self, we find the two horrible systems of ' look and go on,' and some intelligent

boy or girl shouting out the difficult word. But the intellectual understanding of
the piece read is, in a large majority of cases, wholly neglected ; so that at the best
all that is learned is a bundle of words, and at the worst a blundering and stumbling
guess at these words. In numerous instances the illustrative wood engraving could
not be explained, and the instances in which the story or lesson could be in-
telligibly explained amoimt to a very small percentage. From forty to fifty years

ago it was not unusual for two-thirds of the class to be able to repeat a piece from
memory, especially if it were in poetry, the judgment having been made subservient
to the memory throughout. But now memory is the only faculty appealed to, and
that is badly treated, so that the matter of school lessons is forgotten, not in a few
years, but in a few months.

      Arithmetic is still worse taught. There are thousands of children in England

who have been engaged in Addition in Standard I. during a year, and yet who
cannot add four figures, or even three, correctly. The simple fact is that they

 have practised attempting to add daily, but the subject has never been taught to

them, or tested for them, and when they reach subtraction they try to add the two

lines together, or take the smaller figure from the greater whether it be above or

below.
      In Church of England schools the Catechism is still worse taught, but on this

subject the author does not propose to dwell. He has shown elsewhere that to a

learner it is one of the most difficult books in the English language, and it is

 certainly the worst taught.

     For these and similar reasons the charm of intelligence is gone. Education is
reduced to a continuous cram to the boy or girl as a sort of human telephone ; apd

voluntary reading or independent inquiry will inevitably decrease instead of in-

creasing. The capability of reading -will descend in thousands of cases to the

clumsy mastering of a few verses in the New Testament or a sensational paragraph

in a newspaper ; the power of writing will collapse till the person writing can
only sign his or her name ; and arithmetic will diminish to the power of adding a

column of a few figures.
     The remedy for all this is to teach the elementary subjects with a vast deal

more care, so that the pupil may advance from step to step with facility and plea-
sure. There will then be no necessity for taxing the memory to retain what has

been acquired, as the verj' words which have been read will rise spontaneously and

pleasurably, and the inteUectual enjoyment will add a charm to existence.

5. The Education of Pauper Children, industrialh/ and otherwise.

               By the Rev. 3as. O. Bevax, M.A., F.G.S.

The class of children afFocted may be gathered from the following table :

        Total number                              35,223

--Classified thus :                               per cent.

         JUe^itimate                              21-90
         Legitimate                                32-67

                                                                                                                  100-00

     There are six methods of maintenance and instruction adopted, viz. :
     1. Within the walls of the workhouse.
     2. In district schools.
     3. In cottage homes.
     4. In industrial homes, whence children are sent to elementary schools.
     5. Boarding out.
     6. In training ships, &c.

     1. Is the worst plan that could be adopted. The children are massed together.
They become familiar with pauperism, and the life of paupers, as the normal state

of existence ; thej- are brought into occasional close contact with degraded inmates ;
they become acquainted with life on a scale vei-y different from an ordinary house-
hold. They exchange parental love for official supervision.

    On the other hand, the cost is low, and many opportunities are presented for

--industrial traiiung.
     2. District Schools. Here the association with chronic and professional pauper-
ism is avoided, and the surroundings are rendered more favourable ; but the evils
attaching to the association of large numbers of young children under unnatiu-al

--conditions still remain.
     3. Cottar/e Homes. Here the workhouse school and home are split up, and the
parts set down in some pleasant country district. Health, general welfare,

industrial training are well attended to. StiU there are certain disadvantages.
      {a) There are still in a single dwelling, thirty to forty children, imperfectly

classified, with a certain percentage always changing.

     (6) There is a difficulty in the way of finding efficient foster-parents.

      (c) Education is carried on in face of great disadvantages. Children all of one
grade, poorest of the poor, stunted in intellect, devoid of emulation, deprived of
companionship of higher grades.

      (d) Ratepayers have thus to maintain children until the age of fifteen or

thereabouts.

      (e) Children become restless. After age of thirteen or fourteen, the life does
                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

Suggestions were made for the combination and extension of systems.

    6. Southport as an Example of Modern Enterprise. By F. Norfolk.

     The author said that the town provided an extraordinary^ example of rapidity
of growth, and brilliantly showed what may be done in a short time. The popula-
tion of what is now the borough of Southport in 1848 consisted of 62:3 residents;
in 1861 there was a population of 8,940; in 1883 it had grown to 35,065. At
the census of 1881 the aggregate population of Southport and Birkdale was
42,454. It would be easy to estimate by well-known rules what the increase had

been since that time, and the total could not now be much less than 45,000. He had

been supplied by Dr. Vernon with health statistics, which showed that Southport
Stood pre-eminent as a place of health. Further showing the growth of the town,
the author stated that at the incorporation of the borough in 1867 there were
1,369 burgesses, whilst in 1882 that number had increased to 4,891. The ratealole
value of the borough in 1867 was 26,207^., and it had increased to 192,661/. in the
year 1882. This was exclusive of Hesketh and Scarisbrick wards, which were
incorporated in 1878. At that time the rateable value of these two wards was
10,789/., whilst last year it had reached 24,722/. In September 1882, a religious
census, organised by the Southport Guardian, showed an attendance at religious
worship of 87-8 per cent, of the population, leaving only 12-2 per cent, as non-
:attendants on that day. It was only fair to add that on "the occasion referred to
there was no special attraction to draw people to the town, whilst there were other

things likely to draw thousands away from Southport. For many of his facts he
·was much indebted to a handbook recently published by Dr. iMcNicoll, of South-
port. He had a table before him (compiled by Mr. Hyde, a local stockbroker),
-showing the total amount of capital invested in local Limited Liability Companies

which he enumerated, giving the total amount of capital and mortgage debts as
amounting to 1,620,230/. For a town with a population of 45,000 that was
undoubtedly good. The author referred to the handsome buildings which adorned
the town, and stated that at the present time there were between 7,600 and 7,700
 inhabited houses in Southport and Birkdale.

A1. Coviparison of Morecamhe Bay, Barrow-in-Furness, North Lancashire,

        West Cumberland, ^c, in 1836 and 1883. By Hyde Clarke.

     The writer gave an account of his plans and surveys in 18.36 for forming a
through line of railway from Lancaster, through Furness and AVest Cumberland,
across the Solway to Dumfries, and thence to Glasgow, by the course now adopted
by the Glasgow and South-AVestern Railway. The chief feature was the passage
and embankment of the large estuaries called Morecambe Bay. The history of this
undertaking was given, with details of the plans of Messrs. Hyde Clarke, George
Stephenson, Hague, Rastrick, &c., and the works carried out by Mr. James Brun-
lees. Tlie plans of the AVartou Land Company were described. The effect of the
undertaking in the development of Barrow or Foudrey and the iron manufacture
of Fm-ness was illustrated.

2. On the use of the term Stability in the Literature of Naval Architecture.
                      By Professor Osborne Reynolds, F.B.S.

     The term stability is one which has been adopted by mathematicians, with its

--general meaning unaltered unrestricted. The mathematical as well as the general

meaning of stability, is a state of being able to maintain a particular position
against any force tending to overthrow it, or when, on being disturbed and
left free, of being able to return to its original position. It is one of those few
terms used in a technical as well as a general sense, with the same meaning, and
this a meaning about which there can be no question. It would appear that stability
is not a nautical term, that is to say, not an old nautical term, but has been intro-
duced into the science of naval arcliitecture with mathematics. In nautical lan-
guage a ship was said to be stiff or crank, according as it offered great or small
resistance to upsetting forces, while, if a ship would turn over without upsetting
forces she was called topheavy.

     The calUng in the aid of mathematics to give definite expression to these
various qualities in ships, brought in with it the use of the terms stable and un-

stable equilibrium.

    And hence came the use of the term stability as implying the margin of stable

equilibrium. But this was going beyond the mathematical use of the term, for

--stability, as a quantitative measure, has never received mathematical definition
   there being so many causes of stability which must each be measured in a
different way. Thus the stability of a large oak tree arises from the strength of

the trunk, which will resist a very great force, but which, if sufficient force be

--brought to bear, will lose its condition of stability before it has bent to a sensible

extent while, on the other hand, there is the stability of a ship, a reed, or a cradle,
which, while readily yielding according to the magnitude of the disturbing force
will not lose its power of resistance until a certain degree of disturbance is: attained.
--632 DEPORT 1883.

All these objects may be strictly said to possess stability, bat if we use the term

stability in a quantitative sense to express these qualities, in the one case it must
mean a quantity of force, and in the other a quantity of space or angular

disturbance.

     This difficulty in the quantitative use of the term stability appears to have been

lost sight of by na.\n\ avcliitects, who used the term to express both the extent of

heel which a ship might safelj- suHer, and also the upsetting force necessary to cause

this heel. This confusion has not passed without remonstrance, but it appears

from the report of Sir E. J. Reed on the ' Daphne ' disaster, and the discussion tO'

which it has led, that naval architects are using the term stability both in its

proper sense, as meaning a tendency on the part of a ship to hold a particular

position, and also as meaning a tendency in a ship to change its position in a

particular direction. Thus, in laying down the rule which he intends to controvert,

Sir E. J. Reed expresses it thus. 'If a ship has initial stability, and has some

stability also at very large angles of inclination, say 90°, then it is quite certain

she will possess some stability at all intermediate angles.' The strict meaning of

such a rule would be that if a ship when slightly disturbed from its vertical posi-

tion would return to that position, and also if, when slightly disturbed from the

position of lying on its beam ends, would return to this (beam ends) position, then
when slightly disturbed from a position of any particular angle of heel, it

would return to that particular angle of heel. As thus interpreted the nde is

obviously absurd ; and it is clear from the context that in the two phrases

'initial stability' and stability at 90°, the term stability has been used in two

contradictory senses. In the first phrase it clearly has its right meaning, namely

that if the ship be somewhat disturbed from the vertical position it will return,

--but what does it mean in the second phrase stability at 90°. The only interpreta-

tion which will make the rule sense and be consistent, Avith the meaning of stability,

is that by stability at 90° is meant that for a disturbance of 90° the ship will still

be stable about its vertical position. In this sense the rule is intelligible, and

necessarily true, and by no means contradictory to anything urged in the report,

but this is not the sense in which it is clear by the context Sir E. J. Reed under-

stands it. He clearly interprets stability at 90° to mean a tendency to return from

that position_ towards (not to) the vertical. And this interpretation I wish to point

out is inconsistent with the strict meaning of the term stability.
      It has been long ago pointed out that in order to express "the statical qualities

of the stability of a ship in definite language, it was necessary to use two terms,
the one to express the greatest angle of disturbance from which she would return
to her normal position, and it was proposed to limit the quantitative meaning of the

term stability to the measure of this angle, using tlie term stillness to express the

moment of the upsetting forces necessary to produce any particular angle of dis-

turbance.

The adoption of this system, which is consistent and definitive, woidd prevent

the confusion into whicli it appears naval architects have fallen. It would then

be seen that what are ill called curves of stability would be well called curves of

stiffiaess. The importance of this at once appears on applying these curves to

--determine the sailing qualities of ships for, supposing the upsetting force of the

wind constant, the true stability of the ship, with a given wind and spread of sail,

is determined, not by the stiffness, but by whether the stiffiiess at the particular

Andangle of heel is less than for greater angles.  thus the stability, in a quantitative

sense, i.e. the safe angle of heel imder wind pressure is limited, not by the heel at
which stifliiess vanishes, but by the heel at which it becomes a maximum.

              3. On the Euphrates Valley Eailway. TSy J. B. Fell.

    Two ports as points of departure on the Mediterranean were examined by

General Ohesney and Sir John Macneil, one being Seleucia, the port of Antioch,
and the other Alexandretta, in the Bay of Scanderoon ; the latter being considered
.to be the best, as the least expensive to construct, and from its being in a fine
                                                                                        '

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.  633

natural harbour, deep enough and large enough to accommodate the whole of the

British fleet. From Alexandretta the railway would be carried over the Bailan

pass, the summit of which has an elevation of 2,100 ftet, whence the line falls

down to Aleppo at a distance of 90 miles. From Aleppo the railway runs with

easy gradients and over favourable ground to Bussora or Et Kewit, at either of
which places on the Persian Gidf excellent landing accommodation could be provided

for the largest ships afloat.

     The length of the line from Alexandretta ind Bagdad to Bussora, would be-
850 miles, tlie average gradient 1 in 500, and there would be but few curves beyond
Aleppo less than 20 chains' radius.

     The estimated cost for a full gauge single line with passing places is 10,000^:-

per mile, or 8,500,000/.

     Sir William Andrew estimates the through traffic at 406,521/. per annum, and

the local traffic at 540,681/., total 947,202/. Less working expenses 50 per cent..

473,611/. ; this would give a nett revenue of 473,601/. per annum
     The estimated nett revenue of 473,001/. is sufficient to pay 5i per cent, on the

estimated cost of the railway.

     The Euphrates Valley Railway would therefore be able to compete on advanta-
geous terms with the Suez (Janal, and it might not be an extravagant estimate to
assume that it would carry one million tons of goods or even more per annnm, out
of the four and a half millions of tons of British goods now passing through the canal.

    The maximum carrying capacity of the Euphrates Valley Railway may be

estimated at three millions of tons of goods for a single line, and ten millions of tons-

for a double line of railway, per annum.

4. On the Constnicfion and Worlcing of Alpine Baihvays. By J. B. Fell..

     There are three Alpine railways in existence at the present time : the Mont
Cenis and St. Gothard Railways, whicli have been made with long summit tunnels-
and with ordinary gradients ; and the Brenner Railway, that has been made with
similar gradients but without a long tunnel. In addition to these the Mont Cenis
Summit Railway, constructed and worked upon the centre rail system, with

gradients of 1 in 12, curves of 2 chains' radius, and on a gauge I'lO metre, carried
the French and Italian traffic between St. Michel and Susa, for a period of from

three to four years, until the completion of the tunnel line in 1871.

     The existing Mont Cenis Railway may be taken as the best example of an
Alpine railway made upon the great tunnel system. The length of this line is

78 kilometres. The summit level is 1,338 metres above the sea, and the average

gradient is 1 in 53, the maximum being 1 in 30. The construction occupied a

period of 14 years, and the cost is stated to be 133 millions of francs, being at the-
rate of 109,729/. per mile. The net revenue, based on the official retui-ns of 1880,
is 1,020,000 francs after payment of working expenses. The interest on the

capital employed is 6,650,000 francs per annum ; and, after taking into account the-

earnings of the railway, there is a deficiency of 5,630,000 francs, or 228,560/. per

annum chargeable to the Government Guarantees.
     The St. Gothard Railway was opened for traffic in June 1882, and the net

earnings for the first twelve months of working have been 5,425,248 francs, while the
charge for interest on the capital expended, 287 millions of francs, is 14,450,000'
francs, leaving a deficiency of 9,024,752 francs, or 360,990/. per annum.

     The result of the working of the Mont Cenis and St. Gothard Tunnel railways
taken together, therefore, shows a loss of 689,550/. per annum, representing an
amount of 11,791,000/. sterling of unproductive capital employed in these two

great undertakings.

     This enormous loss is borne chiefly by the French, Italian, German, and Swiss
Governments, the large expenditure on these two Alpine railways of 422 millions
of francs being justified by their important strategical and political advantages,

in addition to their local and commercial value.
     Separating the commercial value of these railways from that due to national.

and State purposes, the former being determined by their net earnings of
634 REPORT-- 1883.

6,447,240 francs per annum capitalised, tbe commercial value is found to be

6,160,000/., and that due to national and State purposes 11,791,000/. sterling.

     The important question has now arisen, and has been taken into serious con-
sideration by the Governments and local authorities interested, as to how far it
may be possible to make other trans-Alpine railways, some of which are urgently

needed, at a cost that woidd render them financially practicable ; and to accomplish
this object it has been proposed to eiiect a reduction of one-half or more of the
cost, by carrying these railways over the mountain passes by means of steep
gradients and the use of the centre rail system, as it was adopted on the Mont
(Jenis Railway. There woidd, however, be this great difference between that Kne
and the new summit railways, that the latter would be made on the ordinary
4 feet 8j inches gauge, instead of the narrow gauge of 3 feet 7j inches ; the
gradients would be 1 in 15, instead of 1 in 12 ; and the curves 10 chains', in place of
2 chains' radius, so that a through service, without change of carriages or waggons,
coidd be maintained between Italy on the one side, and France, Switzerland, and
Germany on the other side of the Alps.

     Upon these improved summit railways the same weight and number of trains
could be run that are now running on the Mont Ceuis Tunnel Railway, and with
the protection of avalanche galleries and covered ways the regularity of the
service would be maintained at all seasons of the year.

     The extra cost of worlving expenses caused by workhig over a higher level than
that of a tunnel line would, if capitalised and added to the cost of construction,
still leave a clear net saving of more than one-half in the cost of construction as
compared with the cost of a tunnel railway.

     Of the different projects for additional ^Vlpine railways, the two that are con-

--sidered of the greatest importance, and most likely to be made within a short period,

are first, the Mont Geiievre Railway, from Oulx to Briaiifon, and second, the
Great St. Bernard Railway, from Aosta to Martigny. The former is about twenty
miles in length, would place Turin in direct commmiication with the port of Mar-
seilles, and effect a saving of 100 miles in the distance between the north of Italy
and the south-western departments of France. The cost of a summit railway with
a super-elevation of 444 metres, or 1,45(5 feet, would be 16,000,000 francs, and the
extra working expenses for a traffic of 100,000 passengers and 100,000 tons of goods
per annum, capitalised, would be 3,000,000 francs. The total cost would therefore
be 19,000,000 francs, as compared with 40,000,000 francs, which is the estimated
cost of this railway if made with a tunnel of about half the length of that on the
 St. Gothard Railway. There would also be a saving of several years in the time

required for its construction.

      The Great St. Bernard Railway, from Aosta to Martigny, if carried over the
summit of the pass would have an elevation of 2,776 metres above the level of the
sea, which is about the same height as the Union Pacific Railway in America, and
considerably less than that of the Andes. This summit level might, however, be
reduced to 2,344 metres by a short tunnel of 2 kilometres in length, and further
reduced to 1,998 metres by a tunnel of 4 kilometres in length.

      The cost of a summit railway, including the extra working expenses, would
be 30,000,000 francs, and with the short tunnels above named 35,000,000 and
 40,000,000 francs respectively, for a total length of about 60 kilometres ; whereas
 the estimated cost of a line with ordinary gradients and a tunnel of 6 kilometres
in length is 80,000,000 francs, or double the cost of a line made with steep gi-adients
 on the centre rail system with a short summit tunnel.

     From the foregoing statement of facts it is evident that great tunnel lines cannot
be made -wnthout the aid of subventions amounting to at least double the commercial
value of an Alpine railway; and that, as the railways already made across the Alps

 have satisfied all strategical and political requirements, the expenditure on future
 Alpine railways will probably be determined solely by their commercial and local
 value. If this should be the case, no more Alpine tunnels are likely to be made,

--and a less expensive method of construction must necessarily be adopted such as

 the steep gradient and centre rail system, or this system combined with a short and

 inexpensive tunnel.

      The result of the experiences of the last twenty-five years seems, therefore, to
'point to the conclusion that the method of constructing Alpine railways with long,
 non-paying timnels is a thing of the past. The future belongs to the hest system
 that can he devised for overcoming the difficulties of trans-Alpine railways, rather
 Tby adding to the powers of the locomotive engine, and by other mechanical ap-
 pliances for reducing the cost of traction on steep inclines, which methods are
 capable of indefinite improvement, than by burying in gigantic tunnels enormous

 sums of unproductive capital that, when once expended, are irrecoverably lost.^

                      5. The Injector Hydrant for Fire Extinction.'^

                          By J. H. Greathead, M.Inst.C.E.

     It is calculated that the fire loss in the Metropolis last year exceeded two and
a quarter million sterling, equal to eighteen pence in the pound on the present
annual rateable value of property, and that of this sumprobal)ly at least one million
would have been saved by a system of hydrants with adequate water-supply, such
as those which have existed for many years in Livei-pool, Manchester, and

Glasgow.
     The water supply of London, however, although satisfactory as to quantity,

has not sufficient pressure for hydrant purposes, and from the fact that the supply
has to be pumped up from a low level, instead of coming by gravitation from high
sources, as in the towns referred to, it is impossiljle without enormous expenditure

to adapt it for hydrants.

     Proposals have been made from time to time for improving the supjily or for
introducing separate supplies for tire-extinction, but these have been objected to

on account of the great cost involved or for other reasons.

     At joresent the requisite pressure for jets is given by the pumps of fire-engines.
 ^Hiere, however, efficiency depends upon the power being available on the instant
that the occasion for its use is discovered, this mode of supplying it is eminently

 unsuitable.

      Sir William Armstrong's accumulator system of hydraulic power, generally in
 use at the docks and goods termini, requires no description. In connection with
 the injector hydrant it has been found to be specially applicable to the production
'of jets of water for fire-extinction in cases where the ordinary supply has not
 sufficient pressure for the purpose. Applied to the Metropolis generally in the same
 way, it would furnish a complete and efficient system of fire-hydrants, without im-
 posing upon the ratepayers any additional burden, and if tlie hydraulic power were
 applied to commercial purposes, there would result a considerable gain to them.

      The system can be introduced at once, either generally or locally, because it is
 not dependent on any question of improved water-supply, and would interfere

 Avith no rights or interests.

     The President delivered the following Address :

The British Association for the Advancement of Science admits to its annual
gathering women as well as men ; and I venture to think it does so wisely. Women
now take their place regularly in the ranks of several scientific professions ; and though

they have not shown any desire to enter that to which I belong, there has recently

mteen an example of their capability that direction, which is noteworthy. It has

been publicly stated that Col. Roebling, the distinguished engineer of the Brooklyn
suspension bridge, which is one of the most remarkable works of the age, was

assisted durinp- a long illness in carrying out his work by the talent, industry, and
energy of his wife, who acquired theoretical and practical knowledge enough to aid

in seeing that her husband's design was properly carried out. I think this example
is not unworthy of mention here, as honourable to the individual woman, to the
energetic nation to which she belongs, and to the better half of the human race.

The previous meetings of the Britisli Association have been held in places pos-

sessing very varied characteristics; but in none in which the pursuits of science

could be undertaken under more pleasing circumstances than in Southport, with

which I have been acquainted for a good many years.

It is customary for the President of each Section to begin the session by giving

an introductorjr address. I propose, with your kind indulgence, to ofier some brief

remarks, as far as possible free from technical language, on a subject which is

familiar to my own mind, and within my own experience, during a period now

approaching half a century, that is : The growth of mechanical appliances for the

construction and working of railways and docks.

The railway of the present day is in principle what it was at the outset ; but

it differs in detail from the origiral railway as much, or more than the skewer

which fastened the dresses of the ladies of Elizabeth's time, from the pin of

the present day, or the carpets of this era from the rush-strewn floors of that.

The progress has been gradual, but not slow. From the opening of the first rail-

way to the present date is only a period of about sixty jears, and in that short

time Great Britain and Ireland, the continent of Europe, America, North and

South, India, Australia, and Africa, have been pretty well supplied with railwa.y

lines, more and more perfect in construction, and in a degree more or less suitable

to the needs of their populations.

The growth of the railway line from a mere plank of wood or iron plate, to a

rail laid on stone or wooden sleepers ; from the rail with a flange, to the smooth rail
and the flanged wheel, were earlj^ and important, but now almost forgotten steps

in tlie progress of the railway system. The substitution of the flanged wheel for

the flanged rail was an organic change which has been the forerunner of the great

results accomplished in modern travelling by railway. You may easily imagine

the condition to which our railways would be reduced if they were constructed on

the principle of street tramways; how they would be obstructed by slight impedi-

ments, and how difficult the construction of junctions would be rendered, by con-

sidering how the speed and convenience of railway travelling would have been

retarded if it had not early been discovered that the rail should be lifted clear of

the ground, and the guide put upon the wheel instead of the rail.

After the flange had been abolislied from the rail, the form of the rail itself

took a good while to settle ; and even now there is no universal form of rail,

though in this country and in our colonies the double-headed rail generally pre-

vails, and on the Continent the flat-footed or Yignoles rail. At the outset the

rail was a mere bar of cast iron, with a surface sufficient for the wheels to roll on,

and with a rib deep enough to give strength to sustain the load. Cast-iron chairs

were used to bold the rail  in position                                                   and as, owing to  the nature of  the material
                                                                                       ;

employed, these chairs were frequently injured, the first efforts for the improvement

of the rail were directed to dispensing with the chairs. But the forms of rail

introduced for this purpose did not effect their object, for practical reasons which it

is not necessary here to go into. Mr. Locke introduced the double-headed rail,

the ends of which were at first made to rest in the chair ; but the effect of this

plan was found to be that the rails were speedily worn at the ends, and they had

to be replaced. The fish-plate was introduced to remedy this defect. The fish-

plate was a great improvement in the permanent way of railways. It consists, as

you are aware, of two plates of iron placed on each side in the hollow of the

rail immediately under the head, the plates being held together by bolts passing

through them and through the rail, the bolts being screwed up tight to the rail

at the joint by nuts. The effect is to make the rails as nearly continuous as is

practically possible.

About thirty years ago, when the traffic on railways had been very largely

developed, the parts of the permanent way which had at first been thought likely
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.  637

ito be the most enduring, the rails themselves, were found to be more rapidly worn
·away than was expected. Efforts were made to harden the surface of the rails,
and a plan was introduced by Mr. Dodds for this purpose. It was extensively used
where rails were subject to special wear and tear, at points and crossings. The
conversion was easily' effected : it cost only about fourteen shillings to a pound a
ton, and it was estimated that it doubled the durability of the rails. If they were

turned, of course it increased their durability three times.

      The plating of rails with a steel sui-face was probably begun about 1854. It
was not till about eight or ten years later that rails were made entirelv of steel.

     In Mav 1862, steel rails were laid down experimentally at Chalk Earm Bridge

' side bv side with two ordinary iron rails, and after outlasting sixteen faces of the
iron rails they were taken out in August 1865, and the one face only which had
been exposed dm-ing a period of more than three years to the enormous traffic,
 amounting to something like 9,650,000 engines, trucks, &c., and 95,577,240 tons,

 althouo-h'^worn to the extent of a little more than a quarter of an inch,' even

 then appeared capable of enduring a good deal more work. Steel rails, however,
 were dear at that period, costing about double (12Z. 10s. per ton) as much as
 iron rails ; therefore, although their advantages were manifest, they could not
 aU at once replace iron. In 1866, Mr. Webb, the locomotive engineer of the
 London and North- Western Railway, said they had in use 3,000 tons of steel-
 iheaded rails and about fifty miles of "steel rails; and Mr. Harrison, of the North-
 Eastern, said he had just co'ntracted for 500 tons. Now, owing to improvements in

 the manufacture of steel rails, they can be produced as easily and as cheaply as u-on

 Tails. It was observed in 1876 that if, in order fully to realise the effect of the

 endurin"- quality of steel rails, you take a given section of the busiest portion of

 one of our leading railways, over which upwards of 7,000,000 tons of live and
 dead weight pass annually, you would find that the life of a steel rail on that

 portion of the hne would be forty-two years if the traffic remained the same.

 This would r2duce the cost of maintaining the permanent way of railways from

 210/. to 106/. per mile. W^hen you consider that such a saving on a system of

 600 miles, which at 25,000/. a milecosts twelve and a half millions, is 52,000/. a year,
 or about a half per cent, of the cost of the railway, you will see that, besides some

 increase of dividend to shareholders, no inconsiderable sum may be, and has been,

 devoted by the railway systems of Great Britain to the comfort of travellers out of

  the saving eflected by "the introduction of steel rails.

      You are aware that railways are worked by the aid of an elaborate system

  of signals, by which those in charge of a train are reqiured to be guided in regard to

 its movements. When railways were first opened they were worked without any

  fixed signals, unless a candle placed in a station window on the Stockton and
  Darlino-ton line may be so designated. The candle indicated that the train was to
  stop for passengers, and no candle implied no stoppage. No practical steps were
  taken towards the adoption of fixed signals till the opening of the Grand Junction
  Railway in 1838. The signal then used consisted of a disc fixed to a spindle with
  a handle to turn it, with a lamp at night to answer the purpose of the disc by day.
 This was a mere ' danger ' and ' safety ' signal. In the same year Sir John Hawk-
  shaw desio-ned a disc signal attached to moveable rails for the Manchester and Bolton
  Railway which was set in motion by a handle -\vith a balanced weight attached, so
  that when the switches were open to the siding, the face of the disc was presented ;
  and if the switches were open to the main Ime, the side of the disc was presented.
  The Great Western had a ball signal about the same time for a similar object.
  The semaphore signal was designed by Sir C. Hutton Gregory in 1841, and erected

  at New Cross, and was the first great step in advance in railway signalling. Distant

  sio-nals were first employed in 1846 in Scotland on a branch of the Edinburgh and

  Berwick Railwav, and were generally disc signals. Probably the first distant
  fiio-nals of the semaphore type were those of the Great Northern, which were made

  in'l852. Automatic signals were tried with considerable care on the Brighton line,

   but were abandoned owing to practical difficulties in their working.
        As the number of junctions increased, it became apparent that not only must

   separate signals be given for different lines, but that some khid of concurrent
                                                                                                               ;

--638 KEPORT 1883.

action must be secured between signals and switches, to prevent accident. Sir
Charles Hutton Gregory, in 1843, at the Bricklayers' Arms Junction, gatliered

together chains from all the signals into a stirrup frame, and a sort of parallel
motion was fixed to the frame between the stirrups, in such a manner that the

depression of any stirrup pushed the parallel motion so as to block one or more
of the other stirrups, and thus it was impossible to give two signals which
conflicted with one another at the same time. The switch levers were fixed on the

same platform with the stirrup apparatus, but Avere not interlocked with it. The
switchman, while working the switches with his hands, worked the signals with his
feet. But the switches were not interlocked till 1852. At East Retford Junction
a simple contrivance was used to effect this purpose, which Mr. Ransome considers
the germ of the elaborate apparatus which is now used at most of the great
junctions throughout the country, the main principle of all the systems being that

locking bars moving in horizontal planes should interlock the levers moving in

vertical planes.

    You are acquainted with the outside at least of those long glass houses

built high above the line, at important junctions where hundreds of trains pass

rapidly by day and night, and you may have caught sight on your way of the long

rows of levers with which they are filled. It is with these handles that the signal-

man iiiside the glass house sets the semaphore in motion, and at the same time

opens the points to direct the train on to a particular line, and perhaps simid-

taneously close or lock the points of a branch line, thereby preventing the

possibility of a second train coming on to the line jjreviously occupied. When

the lever is once drawn over, a mechanical contrivance called a ' locking bar ' pre-
vents the points being moved until the whole of the train has passed. In fact,

with the present apparatus for signalling, the number of trains that may be worked
on a line of railway with perfect safety is enormous, and may be said to have
reduced the element of human fallibiUty to as low a point as human ingenuity is .

capable of compassing.

.Vudible signals are in use only in foggy weather, and the detonating signal,

designed by Mr. E. A. Cowper in 1841, continues to be generally employed in this

country for that purpose.

The subject of brake power is one to which very great attention has been given^

both  in this  country  and  abroad                               and certainly,  next to  the  condition  of  the
                                                               ;

permanent way and the efficiency of the signalling apparatus, perhaps nothing in

connection with railways is of greater importance. Many lives and much property

are hourly dependent in a greater or less degree on the power and efficient state

and immediate action of brakes. It has been found that most of the collisions

which have occuired might have been prevented had those in charge of trains
possessed the power of stopping them within a few hundred yards. The higher the

speed and tlie heavier the train, the greater the necessity for a powerfid and simple

brake, capable of being applied throughout the train in the shortest possible time.

While trains travelled at slow speeds and consisted of a small number of

comparatively light carriages, the brake on the wheels of the guards van and the

reversing power of the engine were fairly efficient means of retarding the motion,

or completely stopping trains within a distance absolutely necessary for the com-
paratively safe working of railways. But the demands of the public for increased

speed, or the increased speed offered as one of the results of competition, and the

growing length and weight of trains caused by the rapid augmentation of the

number of passengers, outran the power of the brakes to control eft'ectually the

movements of the train. Means were sought to add to the control of trains by

brakes ; first, by using the power of the steam acting directly on the brakes
secondly, by the connection of several of the old brakes, so as to unite them

under the control of a single brakesman; and thirdly, by the introduction of

brake apparatus connected with the buffers, so as to make the momentum of the

train itself available in generating a retarding force, a result which has not been
realised in practice. Colonel YoUand reported to the Board of Trade, in 1858,
the result of a series of trials with brakes designed on these principles. The

application of the brake to the engine was an old device which had been abandoned
           TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.      639

ou account of the injury it caused to tlie engine. Mr. McConnell, wliose engine

brake was tried by Colonel YoUand, appears to have endeavoured to remove this

objection to a brake on the engine, by applying blocks to the rail instead of to the

wheels of the engine, the block being forced down on the rail by means of an

elbow joint. Colonel Yolland found that the amount of retardation caused by

this brake was comparatively small, and insufficient to prevent an imminent

collision. The second principle, the connection of several brakes united under

the control of one driver, was chiefly represented by the invention of Mr. Newall.

In this system two or more carriages, or if necessary the whole train, were fitted

up with brake blocks, all of which were brought under the control of one guard

by means of a longitudinal shaft, which transferred the motion of the guard's

wheel to the brakes throughout the whole length of the train. In this way an

enoiTuous increase of retarding power was obtained proportioned to the mimber

of wheels, and consequently to the length and weight in the whole train. This

principle has been applied in all good brakes since invented, however actuated
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

and it appears to be the sound principle for the application of the retarding"

force. Newall's application of it has only been superseded by the transfer of

the motive force from the brake van of tlie guard to the engine, where it is

best placed for immediate application, without manual exertion, and under

the control of the engine-driver, who is the first to see any obstruction of the

line, and can be easily communicated with by the guard or passengers in case

of any other cause for the stoppage of the train than that which may be seer

from the front. Indeed, the contrary plan which prevailed for so many years,

and is not yet entirely abandoned, appears to be as irrational as it would be

to take the reins out of tlie hands of the driver of a coach and to place them
in those of the guard behind. In principle it may be taken to be admitted

that the engine-driver should control the brake, that it should be applied to every

wheel of the train, and that in certain cases the brake should apply itself to the

AUwheels.  recent efforts for the improvement of brakes appear to have been

devoted to maldng the action of the brakes automatic, and to increasing the

I'apidity with which they can be applied.

I do not intend to enter into the controversy respecting the best system in use

for obtaining these results. There are several systems by which they are attained

more or less efl'ectively ; and whereas trains which 30 j'ears ago weighed on the

average 30 tons, with engines of the .same weight, running at 35 miles an

hour, could scarcely he brought to a stand in a distance of about 800 or 1,000

yards, now trains of twice or three times tliat weight, and running at a much

higher speed, can be brought to absolute rest in 20 or 30 seconds, and within a

distance of from 300 to 400 yards.

    When railways were first made, the locomotive was a very imperfect machine,

which could only travel economically on roads almost level and straight. As there

are no level plains of great length in this comitiy, and as reducing the natural

.surface of the country to a fair level is both tedious and costly, considerable
detours were made to avoid steep gradients or their alternative, long tunnels, deep
cuttings, and high embankments. In some cases where a very steep gradient could

not be avoided, a stationary engine and rope traction were adopted. The great

improvements in the locomotive gradually led to the almost entire abandon-

ment of rope traction in this country ; and gradients which it would have been

impossible for the earlier engines to surmomit with a load equal to their own
weight, are now ascended with ease with heavy trains at moderate speeds.

Abroad, however, great natural difilculties, and a limited capital, were not

infrequently concurrent conditions which offered to the engineer troublesome

problems for solution. In some districts the locomotive coidd not do the required
work, and other means have had to be resorted to. The plans adopted for over-
coming the difficulty presented by the sudden elevation of the surface over which

a railway must pass, may be typified by the wire-rope system, as employed by

myself on the St. Pardo Eailway of Brazil, and by the central rail .«ystem of Mr.

Fell, first employed on the Mont Cenis Eailway, and since on steep inclines in New

Zealand,

In the case of tlie St. Paulo Railway it was necessarj' to solve the problem of

rising a height of more than 2, GOO feet in five miles ; and as the cost of the

construction of the line was strictly limited, this had to he doue with due regard

to the cost of the remainder of the line, and also to the proportion of cost of work-

ing it in the total working expenses. I chose the stationary engine and wire-rope

system as the best under tlie circumstances, and divided the ascent into four inclined

planes, each with a gradient of 1 in 9^ feet, and of an average length of about a mile

and a quarter. At the top of each there is a bank-head, with an incline of 1 in 75

feet downwards, where the stationary engine is placed. The inclines are worked

by what is known in the North of England as ' the tail-end system,' and are thus

partially self-acting, waggons being attached to each end of the rope, and being

raised and lowered simultaneously. The arrangement of the rails is peculiar.

On the lower half of each incline an ordinary single line is laid, and on the upper

half, above the passing place, three rails are laid, forming a double road, with a

centre rail common to both. Exactly halfway on each incline, the single line of

the lower half and the three rails of the upper half, branch out into a double line

·of way of sufficient length for the trains to pass each other. This arrangement

allows of two lines of pulleys, for carrying tlie ascending and descending part of the

rope, to be laid down above the passing place, while on the lower half a single
line of pulleys only is required. Each incline has a winduig engine of 150 horse-

power. The ropes are of steel wire, and four inches in circumference. There are

some special contrivances for keeping the rope in place, and for controlling the

movements of the train ; but I need only refer to the clip brake, which is supple-

mentary to the ordinary brake. The clip brake grips the rails, and in an

·emergency, by its use, a train can be brought to a standstill in a few yards. Such

an emergency has arisen owing to the breaking of the rope hauling a goods train.

The application of the clip brake arrested the train in a distance of sixty-six feet, the

rope was spliced, and in three hours the traffic was resumed.

     The central rail system was designed by Mr. Fell, and first carried out practically

in the railway made over Mont Cenis, under my direction, before the opening of the

great tunnel. The peculiarity of the system lies in the use of a deep rail laid on its

side between the two ordinary rails; the centre rail is gripped by horizontal

wheels, put in motion by the locomotive, the adhesion of which to the centre rail

gives the locomotive the force necessary to draw up steep inclines, not only its own

weight, but a considerable supplementary load. This is probably the most econo-

mical mode of working very steep gradients under ordinary circumstances, and it

has been found to answer very well wherever it has been efficiently carried out.

In the early days of railways, the only means of tunnelling through hard rocks

Awas by the slow and costly process of the jumper and blasting.  hole was drilled

with a steel-pointed implement, and when it was worked to a sufficient depth to

receive a charge of gunpowder the explosive was inserted, the hole was closed, and,

by means of a slow fuse, the powder was ignited and a portion of rock was brought

down. Many forms of machine drills have been invented by which this process

--was shortened some actuated by hand, and others by steam, air, or water-power.

"What is called the ' Diamond Rock Drill ' was an improvement on the diill itself;

the steel cutting-surface being superseded by coarse diamonds set in a ring of metal.

Several of these drills were fixed on a frame, and, being actuated simultaneously,

a corresponding number of holes were at once driven in the face of the rock. Besides

the increase of speed in driving each hole, many holes being driven simultaneously,

great additional speed in forming the tunnel was obtamed. This has been ex-

empUfied in cutting the Mont Cenis and St. Gothard tunnels in Europe, and the

Iloosac tunnel in Massachusetts, where the length of tunnel to be made through

hard rock would have rendered the cutting impracticable by hand-labour within

reasonable limits of time and expenditure. For cutting tunnels through the softer

rocks, such as sandstone and chalk, machines which cut or scrape away the face

have been invented and .applied with considerable success. Mr. Brunton's machine

was employed experimentally for cutting a driftway in chalk for the Channel Tunnel

Company in 1870, and it worked freely at the rate of about a yard an hour,

Aexcavating a heading of seven feet diameter.  machine of this kind hasa-ecently
                                                                                          ;

been sent to Sydney, to make sewers tlirough tlie sandstone. Colonel Beaumont

and Captain English have invented a machine -which effects the same object in a

somewliat difl'erent manner. This machine has been employed in cutting driftvrays

in the chalk at the rate of about a yard an hour, both in Fra;ice and in England,

and is employed under my direction in cutting a seven-foot heading in the red

sandstone for the Mersey tunnel, with considerable advantage. These machines

bore the heading, and clear away and load the spoil into waggons, at one operation,

and they enable the engineer to dispense entirely with the use of explosives. By

this means the surrounding stratum remains intact, no more disturbance taking

place than would follow the di'i^-ing of an auger through a deal board. They are

moved by any available power according to the situation; in the cases I have

mentioned they have been driven by compressed air, which, as well as driving the

machine, effects the ventilation of the heading in which the machine works.

In the construction of railways and docks, one of the most expensive and tedious

operations is the excavation of the soil. In England, the cutting of numerous canals

had trained a large body of men to special fitness for the execution of such work,

which they performed with a manual dexterity and amount of muscular power

which have made the British navvy a special force in the execution of great public

works. AVhere labour was comparatively scarce and inefficient, as, for instance, in
America, efforts were made at an early period to supplement, and, if possible, super-

sede, such manual labour by mechanical contrivances. In 1845 a mechanical ex-

cavator, after an American model, was used on the Eastern Counties Railway with
a certain amount of success. This machine delivered as much as 100 cubic yards

an hour at a cost which did not exceed fifty shillings a day. In principle, end
generally in detail, it is very much the same as the excavator which is commonly

Icnown as the ' steam-navvy ' at the present day. The machine was locomotive, and

--had three other kinds of motion first, thrusting the scoop or shovel into the earth

second, lifting the scoop when filled ; and third, tiuning round on its centre to deposit
the earth in the waggons. At that time thirteen of these machines were in use in
the United States ; but they have not superseded manual labour in making cuttings

and embankments there, and they have been little used here until recently, and

even now they only compete successfully with bone and muscle under special cir-

cumstances. It is found economical to employ the ' steam-navvy ' where there is a

large quantity of hard and heavy clay or aUuvial soil to excavate, and where the

machine will not only eflect a gross saving per day, but nearly pay for its cost in
the course of a single contract. The disadvantages of the machine are that it is
costly, very heavy to move, requires special plant to work with it, is not readily

saleable when the work is finished, and costs a good deal to keep in repair. On the

other hand, it will work night and day without trouble, it renders the contractor

independent of a large amount of hand-labour, and it will work readily in soil with
which it is extremely difficult for manual labour to deal. It is much to be desired

that the human frame should be relieved of the exhausting labour which makes man

a mere beast of burden, and leaves him at the end of his work only fit to lie down

to sleep off the efi'ects of his toil, and to regain strength to continue the same round

of labour on the morrow. The use of small locomotives for tipping the soil for

embankments has relieved the workmen of one very laborious, and sometimes

dangerous occupation, and, in a corresponding degree, has diminished the cost of

construction.

     In the construction of a railway or dock, a large amount of pile-di-iving is
freqiiently necessary, and the manner of sinking piles has been much considered by

engineers, for the purpose of obtaining rapidity and economy in executing their

works. For some purposes, where piles were formerly used, cylinders are now

sunk, and the manner of sinking them and their form and material have been
much studied. For fine sands, such as were met with in piling for the Morecambe

Bay viaducts, and the promenade pier in this town, I used a disc-pile, lowered into
the sand by its own weight, as fast as the sand was removed from under the disc

--by a jet of water forced through a tube opening at the foot of the pile a plan which

has been applied by others elsewhere, and notably at Calais harbour-works recently,

where a considerable saving has been effected by its use in sinking piles for the repair

of the ·western jetty. At Morecambe Bay force-pumps were used, worked by a
2-borse steam-engine ; here, at Southport, advantage was taken of the pressure on
the town mains. At Morecambe the cost of sinking was 2s. 6d. per foot, and at
Southport only 4^d. ; an economy due to the use of the town water. At Southport
twelve piles were repeatedly put down in a tide ; at Morecambe the average was

scarcely two in a tide.
     For hard gravel, shale, or soft rock, such as is met with in the Mersey, I adopted

a corkscrew form. Abroad, notably in Brazil, where the deposits are mostly allu-
vial, the ordinary bladed screw pile was used in one case for a bridge of ten spans,
in 35 to 40 feet of water, with perfect success. In the Solway Viaduct, more than a
mile long, it was originally intended to use the screw pile; but after getting through
a depth of about 4 feet of sand, it was found that there was such an exceeduigly
hard stratum of gravel, bound with stiff clay underneath, that the screvi^s would
not enter, and a round pointed pile was substituted. I have used metal piles
instead of cylinders, on account of the greater ease and economy with which they

are put in place. In the case of the Eau Brink Viaduct, near Lynn, the span was

111 feet, the screw of the pile 3 feet 3 inches diameter, and the pile 18 inches in
diameter. Five piles were placed under each girder, and as the metal in these was

equal to a cylinder 4 feet 4 inches diameter, three times the bearing surface

was obtained with the same weight of metal. The process of screwing is much

simpler than that of sinking cylinders by the pneumatic process, and the whole

operation is handier and more economical, wherever it can be adopted.

    A great revolution in driving timber piles was effected by Mr. Nasmyth, who

adopted the principle of his steam hammer to the purpose. The Nasmyth pile-
driver was first employed at an extension of the Devonport Docks, where a very
large number of piles had to be used. At the first trial it did in four and a half
minutes the work which by manual labour could only be done in twelve hours, and
was perfectly successful from the first moment of trial. The Nasmyth pile-drivers
o-eneraUy in use weigh about 24 tons ; the boiler weighs 7G cwt. ; the hammer

weio'hs about 30 cwt., and delivers a blow every second on the head and shoulders

Aof the pile, driving it down in ordinary soil "from 5 to 10 feet per minute.

small engine moves the machine on a tramway, and three men manage the whole

 apparatus.

      Iron cylinders for foundations were first used by Mr. Eedman, on the Thames,
 at Gravesend, for the construction of the Terrace Pier in 1842, and they have since
been largely employed all over the world. ]Many improvements have been made
in the methods of sinking cylinders since their first introduction, when they were
sunk into the yielding soil by pressure from above. The first practical application
 of compressed air to the sinking of cylinders appears to have been made in 1839,
 at Chalons, where it occurred to the engineer to cover over the top of the cylinder,
 and by the pressure of the air to drive out the water, and admit the worlcmea
 inside to remove the earth, and gradually to allow the cylinder to smk into its place.
 Lord Dundonald had previously patented the same system in this country, where it

 was first applied in constructing Rochester Bridge.
      Several mechanical contrivances, more or less perfect in their operation, have

 been used for removing the soil inside the cylinders, to assist in lowering them into
 place. Mr. IMilroy, Mr. Bradford Leslie, and others, have designed and used these
 mechanical aids with much success on the Portpatrick railway bridge across Loch
 Ken, at the Gorai bridge in India, and on the Caledonian Railway viaduct over

 the Clyde, and elsewhere. By their means considerable speed has been attained

 in sinking cylinders in difficult circumstances, and where the employment of
 the atmospheric system would probably have been impracticable or unusually

 expensive.

       Sir William Fairbairn attributes the suggestion of caissons to General Sir
 Samuel Betham, in 1798 ; and the ordinary floating caisson, to which the sugges-

 tion applied, has been very extensively used. In the construction of the Keyham
 Docks, Sir William applied a new form of caisson, to obviate difficulties created by

 the great width of the dock entrance and the depth of the basin, and to save the

 time lost in pumping out the old form of caisson. The new caisson was designed
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.  643

by Mr. Scamp, Deputy Director of tlie Admiralty Works. This caisson had a
rectangular section, aod consisted of six boi'izontal divisions or counterparts, of
which two at the bottom formed the air chamber intended to float the caisson a few

inches above the cill, so that it might be drawn into a recess out of the way of
passing vessels. The next compartments were open to each other, and had a sluice

Talve on each side to admit water as ballast, to retain the structure in equilibrium,
and to balance its floating power. The upper or sixth compartment formed a
tank, capable of containing 70 tons of water, supplied from the main by a hose pipe,
and was used for sinking the caisson into its place.

   A few years later (1.S58) another form of caisson on a new plan was adopted

in the formation of the Victoria Docks, London, to act instead of a coffer-dam,
which in the circumstances would have been costly, and have caused loss of time
in construction. This caisson, which was made of wrought-ii'on plates, was rec-
tangular in side elevation, the heel-posts being vertical, and shaped like those of
gates, so as to fit into a hollow quoin, as into a kind of rebate. Its height was 31
feet, and ils breadth 80 feet. Its curvature was not so great as that of the gates,
having a rise, or versed sine, of onlj' 8 feet.

     Caissons which slide into a cut in the wall of the entrances at right angles with
the waterway ha-se also been used successfully. Their chief advantage is that they
can be moved in less time than floating caissons.

     There has been some controversy as to the relative advantage of caissons and
gates for closing the entrance to docks. The former seem to be in favour in the
Goverjiment docks; and at the Portsmoutli Dockyard extension caissons were
exclusively employed. "Where a road has to be provided for, probably a caisson is
not more expensive than a pair of gates and a swing-bridge ; but it cannot be so easy
or so qiuck to handle, especially since the introduction of hydraulic machinery for
opening and cloeiug dock gates.

     One of the most important operations in connection with shipping is the re-
pairing, cleaning, and painting of ships. For this purpose graving docks, from
which the water was removed after the vessel had entered, were and continue to
be mostly employed. But during the lifting of the tubes of the Britannia Bridge
into place with what were then called hydi-aulic presses, it occurred to Mr. Edwin
Olark that similar means might be used to lift a vessel out of the water and place it

in a position to be dealt with similarly to a construction on dry laud. Floating-

docks consisting of pontoons which lifted the vessel out of the water have been
iised in this country, and more extensively in America, for this purpose ; and at
San Francisco and Philadelphia a dock was constructed of pontoons in sections
called ' camels,' any number of which might be used according to the size of the

vessel to be docked. Mr. Clark's plan is quite difl'erent from these. His hydraulic
dock consists of a number of columns arranged in two parallel rows, in which
columns are placed the hydraidic lifting power. Between these two rows of
columns extends a frame or cradle, over which the ship is drawn in the water.
AVhen the ship is in position the hydraulic lifts are set to work, and they raise the
cradle first to the bottom of the ship, which, being properly .secured, is then lifted
with the cradle clear of the water. There is no difficulty whatever in the manage-
ment of this form of dock, and it has been perfectly successfid ; its chief recom-
mendation being that any area of shallow water can be made available for docking
large vessels, and that it is especially valuable in tideless seas.

    Among the many mechanical appliances for saving labour on railways and

docks, the machinery for shipping coal is remarkable ; the bulk, weight, and low
price of coal render every item of saving in transport relatively important. It is
commercially important also that the coal in the different stages of transport from
the pit to the distant consumer should be broken as little as possible, and a good

deal of attention has been given to contrivances to secure these ends. On the
Tyne, coals were brought down to the river on the tramways and put into small

"barges called keels, holding about twenty tons, from which they were shovelled into
the colliers through a porthole ; or where the collier could be i3rought to the river
bank, the coal was turned through spouts direct from the colliery waggon into the
ship. There was no ai-rangement for meeting the difference of level caused by the

                                                                    TT2

tide. The first coal drop on the Tyne was put up by Mr. Thomson in 1813, and aU

subsequent drops have followed the same principle, which was the invention of

Mr. William Chapman, of Newcastle. The loaded waggon in its descent raises a

counterbalance weight, and when the coals are let out of the waggon, the counter-

balance weight brings the waggon back to its original position. The machinery is

controlled by efficient brakes. At Middlesbrough, from 1830 to 1842, the coal

waggons were raised from the railway to the ship's  deck, and  there  emptied                                  but
                                                                                                            ;

when the dock was constructed, special means were adopted for shipping coal

rapidly and with as little breakage as possible. Ten drops were erected, connected

with the railway by ten diverging lines ; the loaded truck is run on to a cradle

directly over the hatchway of the ship to be loaded, the cradle and truck descend

perpendicularly to near the ship's deck, and the contents are discharged by tlie man

who descends with the cradle operating a lever, and a counterbalance )3rings the

cradle and empty waggon to its original position. The movement of the cradle is-

completely controlled by brakes, and it can be stopped with ease in any position..

Each drop can ship about 150 tons an hour, and in 1815 these ten drops shipped

over half a million tons of coal. About the same time Mr. Robinson contrived

for the Bute Dock, at Cardiff, a mechanical system of staiths or drops to supersede

the barrow system, by which coal brought down in canal boats was wheeled along

planks into the ships. As the anthracite and steam coal are generally in large blocks,

it is difficult to use a shoot, and as the coal is very friable it cannot be dropped

from any height. Mr. Robinson conveyed the ten-ton waggons along the staiths-,

lowered them to the ship on a balanced platform which tilted when on the deck,

and the coal was allowed to slide into the hold.

   A great variety of hydraulic machinery has been designed by Sir "William

Armstrong for coal loading, and it is largely employed at Newport Docks and else-

--where. One of the best arrangements is thus described by the inventor : ' The

waggon is lifted vertically upon a cradle by the direct thrust of a ram beneath, and

then tipped into a shoot large enough to contain an entire waggon-load of coal.

This shoot also rises and falls so as to meet the varying height of the deck, the move-

ment being effected by connecting the shoot with the cradle, so as to lift or lower it

Ato the point required, where it is secured by proper fastenings.  pair of doors is

fixed across the mouth of the shoot to regulate the flow of the coal, or to stop it

entirel}'. The tipping of the waggon is done by a press mounted on trunnions,

which travels with the cradle and raises the back end of the platform, which is

hinged in front, to the necessary elevation. For the initiatory process of forming

a conical heap in the ship, an hydraulic swing-crane is affixed to the framework of

the hoist, by which the coal is in the first instance lowered in an ordinary tub from

the mouth of the shoot into the hold, and there delivered at the lowest possible

level. All the movements are guided by valves, which are worked by a man who

stands on an elevated platform at one side of the hoist. The same arrangement

answers equally well ibr hopper waggons. In every case the waggons are brought

up and taken away by means of hydraulic capstans, turn-tables, or traversing

machines, according to the circumstances of each locality, and the rate of shipment

ia only limited by the trimming of coal in the hold, which must necessarily be done

by hand labour.'

Many different kinds of labour-saving machinery, for dock and railway work

in loading and unloading, have been invented during the last fifty years, and

have had a most important influence on the development of railway and steamship

transport. "Without such machinery it would be impossible that the present

enormous commerce of the country could be carried on. If this machinery were

suddenly withdrawn or disabled, the great ocean steamships must lie idle in port,

and the greater part of the goods trains of the railways must cease to be despatched.

Adequately to describe the many kinds of cranes used at railway stations and in

docks would occupy far more time than is at my disposal, according to custom, on

these occasions. But you are all more or less familiar with them in daily use, for

it is impossible to pass along a wharf, or through a dock or important goods

station, without being struck with the rapidity and ease with which goods are

transferred by them from ship to ship, or from ship to shore, or from the platform
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                                      645

to the truck of a railway train. Much of the work which was done by the steam

crane is now done by the hydraulic crane, the first example of wliich,in a stationary
form, was applied by Sir William Armstrong upon Newcastle Quay hi 1846,

speedily followed by hydraulic cranes and hoists at the Albert Dock, Liverpool.
They were first applied to railway purposes at the Newcastle station of what is

now the North-Eastern system, in 1848 ; and Mr. Brunei used hydraulic power

three years later not only for cranes, but for the movement of turn-tables,

traversers, and capstans for haiding waggons at the Paddington station of the

Great Western Railway ; and now not only stationary, but port^able liydraulic

machinery is employed at most of the more important goods depots throughout

the kingdom. Hydraulic machinery has also been largely employed for opening

and closing dock gates and suices, and for warping ships through the locks.

   A large dock is in course of constmction at Hull, by Mr. Abernethy, called the

Alexandra Dock, where almost every kind of machinery which can be used in

work of that nature is being used by the contractors, Messrs. Lucas and Aird, to

expedite the work. Two of Priestman's steam grabs are employed, each capable

of filling about 390 cubic yards a day, and are found very useful in opening out

work for the steam navvies', six of which are employed, each being capable of filling

'800 cubic yards a day. There are a number of steam cranes, steam pile-driving

machines, and steam jiggers at work. But beside those moved by steam power,

hydraulic power has here for the first time been applied to machinery for the

construction of works. An hydraulic crane puts the stonework of the dock walls

in place ; an hydraulic jigger raises the barrow-loads of soil from the bottom of the

dock to the wall where it is shot to the back for filling. One of the six navvies i8
moved by hydraulic power ; and there is an hydraulic pile-driving machine. The
hydraulic machinery is found to work at least as quickly, as easily, and as

economically as steam machinery, and it works almost without noise and quite

without sm'oke. The trial of liydraulic machinery for these purposes has been

quite successful, and where circumstances permit it will no doubt be used exten-

sively in works of construction in future. For dock work much of the hydraulic

machinery can be used permanently in the ordinary operations of loading and

unloading, so that the loss by sale of such expensive plant, which a contractor has

to take into account when making his tender, will be avoided, as it can be turned

·over to the dock company, with a reasonable deduction for wear and tear, at the

end of the work. There are 2,800 men employed at this dock ; and the work is
carried on at night by the aid of the electric light. The mechanical navvies and

^abs do the work of about 400 additional men.

The working of railways by electricity has not advanced further than to justify

merely a brief reference to it in this paper as among the possibilities, perhaps

Athe probabilities, of the not distant future.  line of a mile and a half of tramway

has been working successfully at Berlin for over two years without hitch or

Aaccident of any kind.  line of narrow gauge railway is constructed from

Portrush, the terminus of the Belfast and Northern Counties Railway, to Bush

Mills, in the Bush Valley, a distance of six mUes, which is now partially worked

by electricity, and is to be wholly so worked as soon as the necessary plant is

completed. As the generating power is that of the abundant streams of the

neighbourhood, it will be economical ; and if success should crown this practical

experiment, it may lead to important results in regard to the employment of

electricity under similar circumstances as a locomotive power.

I have now passed rapidly in review some of the more striking mechanical

improvements in the construction and working of railways and docks which have

taken place chiefly within my own experience. Each of them has had an influence

important, if unnoticed, in promoting the growth of our railway and dock

systems. Precisely how far any single appliance has contributed to create these

magnificent systems, of which this country may with just reason be proud, it would

be difficult to say ; and it would be as difficult to say which of them could be
dispensed with without injury to the rest. They may be laid aside in course of

time, one by one, as mechanical ingenuity devises new and better plans to take

their place, and to meet the new and larger wants of other generations. But as

the present age looks back with respect and veneration to the creation of those
monuments of engineering science of which little more than ruins or even historic
records remain, so will the generations which succeed us look on these, our works,
as worthy, and as liaving contributed in no small degree to the greater and more

general civilisation to which we hope those who follow us may attain.

                       2. On the Supply of Hydraulic PoiverJ
                   By Edward Batzaud Ellington, M.Inst.C.E.

     The object of this paper is to show the advantages of hydraulic transmission
of power over large areas, and to give an account of the works already established
in London and Hull for the supply of power on this system.

     The author does not think any one form of power will meet all demands, but
hydraulic transmission is one of the most important means of distribution. At
present the great natural sources of power, such as the tides, are not available, and
whatever system of supply is adopted has to be produced from the combustion

of coal.

     The author then discusses the various systems of transmission available.
      Compressed air is extravagant, and only suitable where ventilation is needed and
in a few special cases. Steam has been tried on an extensive scale in the United
States, and has failed there.
     Gas is a much more important means of distribution, but gas is fuel laid
on, and after being burnt iu a gas-engine some fiu-ther system of transmission ia
needed to bring the power to the machines. In perhaps the majority of instances
hydraulic transmission is the most economical method of utilising the power of a
gas-engine, especially for lifting and other intermittent work. Electricity is even
less likely than gas to supersede hydraulic power, for electricity must be produced
from some other power, and when produced must be ultimately redistributed by
some other means. Hydraulic power can, however, be economically used to
produce electricity for lighting and other purposes.
      Hydraulic pumping engines are the most economical machines for utilising the
power obtained from the combustion of coal at present available. Hydraulic power

when obtained in this way can be utilised direct for many purposes iu a manner
analogous to the production of light by the electric current, or by the burning of a
gas jet e.g., in an hydraulic ram lift or press.

     When rotary engines are required the best power to use must be determined by

 local conditions.

      Hydraulic power is available for the extinction of fire, either direct or by im-
 parting pressure to the ordinary supply, on the injector system, thus acting as a
 continuous fire-engine. Hydraulic power is pre-eminently suitable for public
 supply, because of its economy, the simplicity of the machinery employed, its appli-
 cability to the extinction of fires, and the small inconvenience to the public
 thoroughfare which its supply entails.

      The author then gives a description of the worlcs in Hull and London, and some
 statistics showing the economy of the system. The cost to consumers for lifting
 is from one lialfpenny to three farthings per ton, lifted 50 feet ; and whereas 50O
 lifts or cranes if worked by isolated eng'ines would consume 25,000 tons of coal per
 annum, thev could all be worked from one centre, on the hydraulic system, with
 2,500 tons. There is the further saving of labour in the same proportion, and otlier

 advantasres.

3. On Compound Locomotive Engines} By Francis W. "Webb, M.lnst.O.Bi

In this paper the author describes his method of compounding the locomotive

engine. The system differs from that hitherto adopted, particularly as regards the

number and disposition of the cylinders. Instead of having one large and one

small cylinder, three cylinders are used, viz. two small high-pressure cylinders,

and one large low-pressure cylinder. The two high-pressui-e cylinders are attached

to the outside frame plates immediately under the foot plate, about midway

between the leading and middle wheels, and are connected through their piston

rods and connecting rods to the trailing wheels. The low-pressm-e cylinder is

placed du-ectly over the leading axle, and its connecting rod lays hold of a single

throw crank on the axle of the middle pair of wheels. By this arrangement the

engine is practically balanced, and enabled to run steadily at high speeds, and the

wheels being driven by separate engines, coupling rods are dispensed with ; it is

not even necessary that one pair of wheels should be of the same diameter as the

Aother.  passenger engine constructed on this principle in December 1881, has

run more than 100,000 miles, with the heaviest and quickest trains on the London

and North Western railway, and the commercial results, when compared with

ordinary engines doing the same class of work, have been very satisfactory.

       5. On the Construction and Ventilation of long Railway Tunnels.
                                    By T. R. Ceampton.

The author explained that by the adoption of three tunnels, they can be con-

structed cheaper where ordinary locomotives are used, give better ventilation than

in one, and that any two of them can be used at pleasure for the traffic, whilst pure

air for ventilation passes through the other.

About midway of the length of the tunnels, all of them are connected together

by large aii'-passages (with no valves), so that air may pass freely from one to the

other. About midway between the centre of the tunnels and each of their ends is

formed a branch at right angles, either above or below the other tunnels, and from

this branch openings are formed into each of the tunnels, each opening being pro-

vided with doors or valves clear of the main tunnels. The branch is led to any

convenient point, at which a pumping engine or exhausting apparatus may be

erected for withdrawing foid an- from it. If two of the tunnels are left open to

this branch, and the third one shut oiF from it by closing the doors or valves,

vitiated air will be drawn off from the two tunnels through the branch, whilst

fresh air will enter them, partly through their open ends, and partly at the centre,

where it is in communication Avith the third tunnel, so that fresh air will be drawn
along the third tunnel, from the bottom of its vertical shaft, down which air is

forced, provision being made for the purpose, and will pass into the other two near

their  centre, and be di-awn through the branch, as above     explained                                         the quantity
                                                                                                             ;

of pure air being sufficient, so as to dilute the bad gases.

By means of the doors or valves above mentioned, any of the three tunnels can

be used as fresh air inlets, whilst the others are used as outlets for the mixed im-

pure air and gas.

Bv this means all the three tunnels will be efficiently ventilated, whilst at the

same'time the line of rails in one tunnel can be repaired, whilst the other tunnels

are used for the passage of trains ; and the tunnel in which repairs are going on

may be made the fresh air inlet tunnel ; so that the gangs of men working in it
may have perfectly fresh air to work in, and be free from all danger fi-om the run-

ning trains. If a breakdown of a train occurs in any one tunnel, that can be at
once converted into the fresh-air inlet tunnel, whilst the traffic is can-ied on through
the other two, thereby avoiding delay. It was explained that in the event of motors
teing invented requiring no ventilation, an additional line of rails would be available
for trafEc without further delay.

   A permanent way was described, by the adoption of which much economy of

labour for repairs would result.

6. On the Resistance of Beams token strained beyond the Elastic Limit.
                   By Waltee R. Browne, M.A.^ M.Inst.O.E.

     It is well known that the ordinary theory of the resistance of beams to trans-

verse strain depends on the following assumptions :

     (1) AUstraight lines normal to the axis of the beam in its unstrained condition
remain straight and normal to the axis in its strained condition.

     (2) Hooke's law holds ; that is, the strain on each layer or fibre is proportional
to the stress causing it.

     (3) The rnodulus of elasticity is the same on both sides of the neutral axis;
i.e. the extension and compression produced by equal stresses are themselves equal.

     It is not generally pointed out that the second of these assumptions tacitly in-
volves another, which is as follows :

(4) The_ shearing stress acting between the successive layers or fibres may be

neglected                                       in other words, the                                               resistance  offered  by each fibre to the tensile stress
                                             ;

M13 the same as if it were not connected to the fibres above and below it in any way.

    Let be the bending moment at any given section of a rectangular beam,

Ty the distance of any fibre from the neutral axis, the unit stress on that fibre,
R the radius of curvature
                                                                                                          ;  then the above   assumptions lead  to the equations--

                                                                                                             M = |Trfyxy=^fyVy

Now if the_ shearing stress between any two fibres is to be neglected, it follows

that the shearing strain, or the amount by which one surface has shifted over to

the other,  must be                                  small.                                                  For  cases  below the elastic limit, in which the original
                                                                                   _

normal sections still continue normal, two successive layers are strained so nearly

--by the same amount that their diflerence in length in other words, the distance by

which they have shifted over each olher^will be excessively small. Hence, so

long as the tensile stress, or T, is within the elastic limit of the material, this con-

dition holds                                         but when T                                              passes this limit, and especially when  it  approaches the
                                                  ;

ultimate tensile strength, the case is different.

   We may refer to the actual extension of a bar of mild Siemens steel, as de-

termined by Professor Kennedy (' Proceedings Inst. Mech. Engineers,' 1881, plate 30),
under stresses varying from to 60,000 lbs. per square inch. The same figure will

represent the actual extension in the successive layers of the extension side of a steel

bar of the length and of the depth shown, provided we assume that the stress on

Plliese layers increases uniformly from the neutral axis at to the outside at A, as

ia the ordinary theory of elasticity it is supposed to do. This assumption, as we

have seen, involves the hypothesis that the shearing stress between the different

layers may be neglected, and for this it is necessary that the extension of any one

layer beyond that next to it should be small. Is this the case ? On looking at the
figure, we see that the difference in successive extensions is very small up to a point

L, where the stress is about 41,000 lbs. per square inch. At this point, however,

the extension increases by about f inch (in 40 inches), without any farther
increase of stress ; and it then goes on increasing rapidly up to fracture.

Let us consider the behaviour of the fibre at L (taken to be the outside fibre of
                                                                           TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                                  649

Wethe beam), as the bending- moment is increased.                                                   may suppose it to extend

uniformly, by Ilooke's law, till the stress upon it becomes equal to 41 ,000 lbs. per

square inch as shown. If unconnected with the fibres below it would then elongate

by about | inch. But the shearing resistance of the fibre below will oppose this
·elongation. In other words, the equation of equilibrium for this fibre, when

'equilibrium is re-established, will be Tj = T + S, where T, is the stress due to the
bending moment, T the tensile resistance, S the shearing stress along the line of
division between the fibre at L and the fibre next below, say at the 40,000 line,
tiet us now turn to this second layer, next below. The shearing stress, S, will

produce an extension in it, which must be added to the extension due to the ex-

ternal stress, Tj ; and when equilibrium is restored, this double stress, S + Tj, will be

balanced (1) bj- an increase in the elastic tensile reaction due to this extension in

length (2) by an increased shearing stress, acting between this second fibre and
                                 ;

the next below. And the same will hold of the third fibre ; that is to say, its length

will be increased, producing an increase of the elastic reaction, and at the same

time of the shearing stress between it and the fourth layer ; and so on down to the

neutral axis.

AVe thus see that the effect of the shearing resistance at L, when the strain

approaches the breaking point, will be to increase the elastic tensile resistance T,

for every point of the section from L to P, where P is a point at the neutral axis.

But it is the sum of the moments of these successive tensile resistances which

balances the external bending moment.

Hence the effect of this shearing resistance will be that an increased proportion

·of tliis bending moment will be balanced by the elastic reactions of the material

in the parts near the neutral axis, and this will leave a smaller part to be balanced

by the elastic reactions of the parts near the outer fibre. In other words, the

effect is to throw a greater duty upon the parts of the beam near the neutral axis,

and to relieve those at a distance from it, and so to increase the effective strength

of the beam.

This investigation seems fully to account for the fact that the transverse

strength of a beam is always found to be much greater in practice than when it is

calculated b}- the ordinary theory of elasticity ; i.e. when the stresses on the different

fibres are assumed to be still proportional to their distance from the neutral axis,

and the outside fibre is assumed to be strained by its breaking load.

This investigation has also a very important effect on the question of employing

solid or open beams, solid or hollow shafts. The ordinary theory of elasticity
shows that if we wish to carry the greatest load with a given depth and weight

of beam, we should dispose the material in two flanges or ribs, as far apart as

possible, and only connected by cross-bracing or a thin web, such as will enable

them to work together. All iron and steel girders, &c., are constructed on this

theory. Now, in such structures, the maximum load can usually be calculated

beforehand with tolerable accuracy, and the girder is always so designed that the

)i;-reatest stress this load can impose is well below the limit of elasticity. Hence,

in such cases the ordinary theory (which is not at all afi'ectedby this investigation)

may be used with safety. But the case will be quite difierent for any structure

which, by accident or otherwise, is liable to be strained much beyond its limit

of elasticity.

    For in the same figure suppose the metal from P to L to be absent, and only
that beyond L to remain. Then when a stress = 41 ,000 lbs. per square inch comes

on the fibre L, there is no shearing resistance below to take up any part of it : the

fibre will extend the full distance accordingly ; and the relief to the outer part

of the beam, which we have seen to be given by the increased strain thrown upon

the inner parts, cannot occur.

This applies especially to shafts, such as the axles of railway vehicles, or the

crank shafts of steamers. Both these are liable to be broken, and are not unfrequently

broken, by special strains, induced under peculiar circumstances. It has been

attempted to render these shafts stronger (for the same weight of metal) by

making them hollow. In the case of railway axles the attempt was soon

abandoned                                                      but in the  case of  marine  shafts  it has been largely  carried into  effect
                                                            :

since the introduction of steel as a material ; and its advantages, so far as stifiiiess
is concerned, have been lately set forth in a paper by Professor Greenhill ('Proceed-
ings Inst. Mech. Engineers,' April 1883). In the discussion on that paper, how-
ever, Mr. Edward Reynolds, of Sheffield, quoted some experiments made by him
on hollow and solid shafts under the impact test, in which the hollow shaft was

much the inferior of the two, and gave way very rapidly when once the strain
exceeded a certain limit. This is exactly what the theory now given points out

would be the case.

     It would seem, therefore, that the provision of hollow shafts is a serious error

in all such cases, and shoidd not be continued.

The ABC telegraph of AVheatstone was used in 1864 in Newcastle, and an

Exchange formed there to facilitate intercommunication among the subscribers.

ABCIn 1882 the  apparatus was replaced by telephone, and a great impetus given

to this mode of transacting business. All the outlying manufacturing district was

brought into the system. The wires are placed underground, and are used in

Ametallic circuit. The Gower-BeU form of telephone is that used.  special form of

switch board has been designed by which prompt attention is secured, by which the

switch clerk can see at a glance the condition of every wire, whether it is engaged

or not, and whether the subscriber is in his office or not. There are over 330

subscribers. The average number of telegrams dealt with daily is 210, and the

number of exchanges of intercommunication 2,200.

     The system now embraces Newcastle, Sunderland, South Shields, Tyne Docks,

West Hartlepool, and Middlesbrough.

     The paper commenced with a description of the launch ' Electricity,' which
made her first trip in September 1882.

     The ' Electricity ' is 25 feet long, with a 5 feet beam, and draws 21 inches
forward and 30 inches aft. Her speed is 8'3 miles per hour with ten passengers
on board. Forty-five SeUon-Volclanar accumulators stored under the seats and
decks forward and aft suppUed the current to two Siemens D3 Series dynamos
placed side by side on the iloor of the boat, with their axes parallel to the propeller

shaft.

   A Carliss-Browne two-bladed propeller, of 20 inches diameter and 3 feet pitch,

was employed in these first experiments ; straps and pulleys were resorted to in
order to reduce the speed of the screw to 350 revolutions, whilst the motors
revolved at 950 revolutions per minute.

     The two motors were coupled in parallel circuit, whereas the cells formed one
series. Each machine had its own switch and ammeter, and the starboard machine
could be stopped mechanically by means of a friction clutch on the countershaft.

Both machines were tested with a Prony brake, and they gave 1'86 horse-power on
the brake at 950 revolutions, consuming a current of 21 amperes and 100 volts..

At 694 revolutions, 100 volts and 33-25 amperes, the brake horse-power rose

to 2-78.

     "With forty-seven cells on board, the current used by both motors running
together was 46 amperes, and the propeller made 360 revolutions; when
disconnecting one of the motors the current passing through the other was 33
amperes, and the speed of the propeller shaft fell to 250.

     Messrs. Siemens' dynamos lend themselves very readily to the purposes under
consideration ; the height of a Dj machine is only 10 inches, length 28 inches, and
width 23 inches. The two machines weigh together 632 lbs., countershaft,
supports and pulleys 180 lbs., total for the driving apparatus 812 lbs.

     Each Faure-Sellon-Volckmar cell aa manufactured by the Electrical Power
Storage Company for these launches weighs 56 lbs., and it is capable of furnishing

350 ampere hours, or a fairly constant working current for 7j houre at full speed of

boat.

   A cell is made up of forty lead plates, each 7^" long by 5^" wide and barely

^" thick, placed vertically in an ebonite box containing dUuted sulphuric acid

covers  are  provided to prevent spilling of liquid                                                                                                                                             the external dimensions of  each

box are 8f " long, 8" wide, and 7V' high.

In later experiments with the boat the two D3 dynamos were now replaced by

one D, Siemens machine, this machine being directly connected to the screw shaft.

The weight of this machine is G58 lbs., the space occupied 15" in height, 30"
Ain length, 28" in width.
                              new propeller with two blades on the lines of the

Carliss-Browne type was constructed and experimented with ; its original dimensions

were 19|-" diameter, 12-9" pitch, and 103 square inches of expanded blade area.

With forty-five cells in circuit on board, the current consumed was 67'2 amperes,

and the screw made 630 revolutions; after altering the blades successively, the

screw became reduced to 17|" diameter, lU" pitch, and 66 square inches of

expanded blade area; at this point the machine'only required 43 amperes of current

with 46 cells, the screw and armature making 840 revolutions ; the speed of the

boat being almost the same as originally with a current of 57-2 amperes.

More recently Messrs. Yarrow and Company, in conjunction with the

Electrical Power Storage Company, fitted up another electrical launch, destined

for the Vienna Exhibition.

      This boat is 40 feet long, with 6 feet beam, and can carry 40 passengers ; the
whole of the raachinery and secondary cells are disposed imder deck as ballast.

     The motor is a Siemens Dj machine which develops nearly 7 horse-power, with
80 cells and a current of about 40 amperes. As in the last case, the spindle of the
armature is coupled to the propeller shaft. The screw is two-bladed, of thin forged
steel, and was designed by Messrs. Yarrow ; its diameter is 19 inches, pitch
13 inches. The weight of the motor and batteries combined is 2^ tons.

     During the trial over the measured mile the speed of this boat was over

8 miles per hour, the current used at the time being 41-22 amperes, and the counter
E. M. F. 112-5 volts with 60 cells in circuit.

     The speed of the boat is varied by a commutator, which throws more or less

cells into operation.

Forty amperes is a very economical rale of discharge for these small cells, but

where great power is required lor a short space of time they can yield as much as

80 amperes, and the same weight of accumulators can furnish double the power,

but for less than half  the  time                      in this manner very high speeds could be                                                                                                 obtained

     The launch described is a wooden boat, clinker built, 21 feet lon^ over all by
4 feet 4 inches beam, and drawing 12 inches of Avater with three or four persons on
toard. She is fitted with an electric motor coupled direct to the propeller shaft,
and her power is derived from two battery boxes 3 feet long: b}- 8 inches wide, and
12 inches high, which can be utilised as seats. The Ijatteries require recharging
with chemicals about every four hours of continuous use, one battery driving the
boat at three quarters speed, while the other is being recharged. During several
trials at Kilcreggan-on-Clyde, a speed of a little over five miles an hour was
obtained, the motor running at 600 revolutions per minute. The Aveight of the
boat complete, with batteries charged, is 4 cwt. These electric launches are

now being built by Messrs. Gilbert Bogle & Co., of Glasgow, of varj'ing sizes, from

15 feet long and four miles per hour speed, to 30 feet long and seven miles per
Lour speed,

                6. On Electric Tramways} By M. Holroyd Smith.

     The author said he had been led to consider the subject on account of a proposal
to introduce tramways in the town of Halifax, which presented unusual difficulties
owing to the narrow, tortuous, and steep character of many of the streets. Horse
traction he considered out of the question there, steam was doubtful owing to the
objection the public had to it, and the cable system was inapplicable in consequence
of the enormous outlay it would involve, many of the roadways being of solid rock.

He then gave an account of the experiments he has made, and explained the plan

which he had finally adopted. This is to lay a rectangular pipe or conduit under-
ground between the rails, and to carry the electric conductors on insulated sup-
ports within it. The current is collected by a carriage proA-ided with sliding contact
pieces, and running in the conduit, and is conducted to the motor on the car by a

      7. Secondary Batteries and the Economical Generation of Steam for

      Electrical Furiioses. By W. W. Beaumont and C. H. W. BiGGS.

      The first part of the paper referred to an investigation carried out during
the past two years under the direction of Mr. D. G. Fitzgerald in conjunction
 with the authors, with the view of remedying the defects in secondary
batteries of the Faure-Sellon-Volckmar type. The lead plates of such batteries
 were found frequently to fail in practice, because under the influence of the
current they bend or" buckle and two plates touch, when they are worse than
 useless, or the containing lead is acted upon, and tlie plugs become loose and drop
 out or do not touch the lead-holder sufficiently to make a good electric contact.
 The later experiments were carried out by Messrs. Schiassi and Dornbusch at
 the School of Electric Engineering. The investigations were (1) in regard
 to the cathode or reducing pole ; and (2) relating to the anode or oxidising pole in
 charging. In the ordinary form of battery the liberated hydrogen at the cathode
 soon separated more or less completely the active material from the supporting
 lead. After a long series of trials the lead support had been satisfactorily replaced
 by carbon, and the result seemed to give an almost perfect plate. But carbon
 cannot be so used for the anode, because peroxide of lead reacts upon it, and cannot
 be formed in its presence. AVhilst, therefore, the available material is very much
 restricted at the anode, much can he done to render the material used less liable to

· deterioration. Two methods had been followed. One was to coat the lead support

 with material not acted upon detrimentally by dilute acid or by the electric current,

leaving a comparatively small surface that can be acted upon. It was found that
the material known as Front's glue gave good results. Another device was to use-

as the support a material electro-negative to lead, so that a comparatively ineifec-

tive local couple was formed. Altogether these experiments have now resulted in
the ability to construct a secondary battery which may be left for some time with-
out appreciable loss, and the life of which is greatly extended beyond what was
hitherto possible. The second part of this paper dealt with the economic genera-
tion of steam for electric and other purposes. It described a special combination of
elephant boiler with the ordinary furnaces replaced by coke ovens. By these means
the gases usually wasted from coke ovens were utilised in the production of steam.
The coke produced was of the hard kind required for foundry and smithshop pur-
poses, and its value was equal to or greater than that of the coal from which it is
produced. The sj'stem had been in use considerably over two years with complete

success.

           8. FireRishs of Electric Lighting. Py Killingwoeth Hedges.

     There is a great difference between the electric currents which have been in
constant use for telegraphic purposes, and those which are to be supplied by the
undertakers under the Electric Lighting Act. The latter can only be said to be
free from danger when the heat generated by the current is utilised in its right

place, and not developed in the conductors or wires which lead the electricity to

the incandescent lamps.

     The Fire Risk Committee have already issued rules for guidance of users of
electric light ; these can hardly be said to embrace all the salient points of the new

subject, which can only be arrived at after years of practical work. The necessity

of proper regulations has already been recognised by the insurance offices, both in
the United States and Germany, and some of their special rules are given in this

paper.

     The conductors must be properly proportioned for the current they have to
carry ; whatever resistance there is in the conductor will cause a correspondino-

development of heat, which will vary with the amoimt of electricity passing, and

inversely as the sectional area.

     The material must be free from impurity, otherwise an impure section will
increase the resistance. The extraordinary difference in the conducting power of a

sample of ' commercial ' Rio Tinto copper wire, as compared with the pure metal,

--was shown in an experiment by Dr. Matthiessen the conducting power being only

13'6 as against 99'95 for pure copper.

     The continued heating of an impure metallic conductor has a certain effect on
its electrical resistance. With the sample just mentioned, the conducting power
at 100° 0. decreased from 13'58 to 13-558 after the wire had been heated for

three days. It does not always follow that there will be a decrease in the con-
Aducting power, as, with alloys, the opposite effect is produced.
                                                                   copper-silver

alloy showed an increase of -264, after having been heated to 100° C. for three days,
and a tin-copper, an increase of '13.

    As the temperature in Dr. Matthiessen's experiments was not increased over

--100° C, the author has made some further experiments heating the wires by the

electric current from a secondary battery, to within a few degrees of their melting-

point.

  --The materials given on the table printed on the next page were tried the

wires and foils having such sectional area, and so arranged that, on the current

being increased by twenty per cent., they were immediately fused.

The total length of each experiment was twenty-four hours, during which time

the current passing through varied slightly, and the following is a mean of the-

results :

abandonment of that method by one or two of the highest authorities and most

extensive experimenters. These difficulties fall imder two heads :

1. The construction of a suitable meter and the determination of its constants.
2. The mode of using it to obtain sub-surface velocities.

     The meters which are by far the most generally used have a revolving screw or
fan, the number of tm-us of which in a given time aftbrds a measure of the speed

of the current. Instruments of this class have been brought to a tolerable state of
perfection, and by means of various devices by which electric communication is

established between the screw and the observer at the surface very satisfactory

results have been attained. The mode of using this kind of meter at comparativelv
small depths and moderate velocities is to employ a rod of wood or metal, or an
iron tube, by which it is held in the required position. Where the channel is deep
and the current swift this method requires either elaborate raft or other arrange-

ments, or the assistance of several men. If, as is very often the case, the channel
is a tidal and navigable one, and interruptions are frequent, the taking of a series
of observations by these means is a toilsome and laborious task. It is under the

latter conditions that the author is at present engaged in taking a series of obser-

vations, and this paper contains a brief account of certain instruments employed,
and the mode of using them.

      One object of the experiments was to obtain velocities at one point near the
bottom during the whole rise and fall of the tide. To avoid the labour of frequent

observations and the continued attendance above the point with a boat, which
would have been otherwise necessary, the plan was tried of supporting the meter
at the bottom of the channel instead of suspending it from above. This was done
by driving an iron bar into the river bed at low water, and screwing the meter to

it in its right position, and at such a depth as to avoid all danger to or from

passing shipping.

   A self-recording meter was necessary, and the one exhibited was employed.

The instrument in its original form has been elsewhere described by the author,^

but the present form has a most important modification in the recording appa-

ratus. Into the water-tight barrel a spindle passes, which is turned once for

fifty revolutions of the screw. At every revolution of the spindle a needle is

raised which flies back under the action of a spring and punctures a tinfoil

sheet, a specimen of which was shown. This sheet is wrapped round a drum,
which is turned imiformly by cloct^vork once in an hour, so that not only can
the velocity be determined by the number of dots in a given space, but also the
time at which the particular velocity occurred. In order to use the whole surface

of the foil, the piece which carries the marking needle and spring moves along by
a slow screw, so that the instrument will record continuously for as long as
twelve hours. There is yet another point, viz., that in order to record the time
when the tide turns another needle is used, which records the motion in the

opposite direction, and the marks on the foil slant the opposite way.
     The special objection which was found to hold with this arrangement is the

fact tbat weeds and drift moving along near the bottom get entangled in the fan.
In this case there is nothing in the record to enable the cause of the consequent

alteration to be detected with certainty. Moreover, the bearings of the fan need

frequent examination in the muddy waters in which the instrument was employed,

and this it was, of course, impossible to secure.

For this reason the author afterwards employed at all depths the method,

which has recently been used by Professor Unwin and other observers, of sus-
Apending the_ meter with a weight.
                                    suitable tail causes the meter to take its

proper position in the current, and it can be easily hauled up for inspection.

The author was led to conclude that for the above reasons no meter with a

revolving screw could be left to work by itself at any rate under these conditions.

Also that the method of suspension by a rope is by far the easiest and most rapid
mode of experimenting.

     There are, however, at least three serious objections inherent in screw current
meters

' Minutes of Proc. Inst. C. E., vol. Ixix. p. 399,
656 KEPOET-- 1883.

(1.) Tlie speed of the fan at even moderate velocities is not proportional to the

speed of the water.

(2.) It is impossible to maintain the same conditions of friction for more than a

very short time of working, especially in impure water.

(3.) They stop altogether at low velocities.

The iirst involves considerable expenditure of labour if the records of observa-

tions at low velocities are to be worth anything at all. In the first place the meter-

must be carefully rated at a number of diflPerent velocities, and this without

elaborate appliances is a difficult matter to accomplish. The result of such a

rating made by Mr. R. E. Froude, at the Admiralty Experimenting "Works,.

Torquay, is shown by the curve (exhibited on a diagi-am), by which the second

and third objections were made evident as well as the labour involved by the first.

It was with a view of overcoming the foregoing objections that the instrument

Aexhibited was contrived by the author.  description of this was then given,,

and its advantages were explained, as well as some of the results obtained by it.

                      2. A Flexible Band Dynamometer.^

                       By Professor "W. C. Unwin, M.Inst.C.U.

     The ordinary flexible band dynamometer consists of a band passing over a brake
pulley with a fixed weight at one end and a spring balance on the other. The-
difference of the tensions measures the friction, and the product of this and the
velocity of the pulley gives the work absorbed. The chief difficulty in using it is
that the oscillations of the spring balance make the determination of one of the

tensions inexact. By taking the band over an idle pulley and back over the brake-
pulley, the tension to be measured by the spring balance is made very much less,

and the effect of errors in measuring it has less effect on the determination of the
work absorbed.

         3. Curves of Air Besistance. By Professor Geeenhill, M.A.

     The author presented a series of curves plotted from experiments by Mr.
Bashforth and Herr Krupp, of Essen, on the velocities of projectiles. In these
curves the abscisste represented velocities and the ordinates resistances. At low
velocities the curve was a parabola, hut at the velocity of sound it suddenly

stepped up and pursued another pai-abola at a constant height above the first. At
the speed corresponding to efflux into a vacuum the curve rejoined the original

parabola, and followed the law that the resistance varies as the square of the
velocity. The part of the curve between the two limits also followed the same
law with a constant added. In 3Ir. Bashforth's experiments the velocity varied
from 100 to 2,800 feet per second, and the resistance was tabulated in pounds per
circular inch. In Krupp's experiments the speeds varied from 140 to 700 metres
per second, and the results were given in kilos, per square centimetre. His curve
lay below Bashforth's, indicating a lower resistance, due to difference in the sha})e
of the head of the projectile. The lowest velocity of 100 feet per second, or 70
miles per hour, overlapped, the author said, those dealt with in meteorology and
engineering, and gave only a pressure of 10 lbs. per square foot. At 2,800 feet per
second the pressure was 35i lbs. per circular inch, or 6,500 lbs. per square foot.
These results did not agree with those deduced from wind pressures.

                     4. Southport Sewage.'^ By Isaac Shone.

   By the aid of maps, sections, and diagrams, the author explained his semi-

pneumatic and semi-hydraidic system of collecting and ejecting sewage-proper within
flat town areas, such as obtain in Southport. His system, while it was specially re-
commended by him for draining low-lying and flat towns on the 'separate system,'

·was, be contended, none the less applicable to towns where the ' combined system ' of
drainage was in operation, and which might, on that account, be preferred to the
'separate system,' because by the employment of his hydraulic sewage-ejectors
fixed at the houses and heads of sewers, and by the employment of bis pneumatic
sewage-ejectors, distributed over the town to be drained, suitable house-drains and
public sewers could always be laid at such gradients as would cause the sewage
flowing into them to flow through them at * self-cleansing velocities,' a condition
which if invariably insisted upon would result in the practical extinction of

offensive and dangerous sewage-gas emanations.

                    Employed. By G. H. DAGiiiSH, M.lnst.C.E.

      In briefly giving the histoi-y of this colliery the author states that the shaft

passed through the Ince, Furnace, Pemberton, and Wigan mines, including ten

distinct sections, before striking cannel, which was done in 1862, after two years'
working.

     Temperatures were taken at intervals during the sinking of the shaft, and they
were found to be as follows :

towl, light being supplied at night by a top lamp. The registering apparatus is
fitted in the bowl below the card. It consists of a barrel containing cloclm-ork,
which causes a second barrel within the first to continuously revolve at a given
speed, the outer barrel being fixed and having two slots cut through on its upper
surface parallel to the axis. The compass card has also a slot, curved in such a
manner that some one part of it is always across one or other of the straight slots
in the drum, and as the inner barrel is when in use covered with a sensitised paper,
it will be at once understood that in whatever course the ship is being steered a ray
of light either from the sun or from the lamp will pass through the small opening
made at the intersection of the curved slot in the card with one or other of the
straight slots in the drum envelope, and will produce a black mark upon the pre-
pared paper, more or less distant from the centre of the card, which from its
position will give an exact indication of the course of the vessel at the time. The
revolvhio' motion of the drum gives the duration of time the ship's head is on each
coui-se, as well as the time such courses are changed.

the conditions necessary for success, the cost, &c.

  4. The Action of Waves on Sea Beaches. By A. E. Hunt, M.A., F.G.S.

      The author referred to the difl'erence of opinion that exists as to the relative
 accumulative and destructive action on beaches of large and small waves ; and
further, as to the size of shingle that is propelled by waves to the greatest

 height.

     He endeavoured, by a description of a series of observations and experiments,

 to show that the ordinary oscillating wind-wave or swell is never converted into a
 wave of translation, and that it is to the assumption that the character of such
 ordinary waves is so altered on approaching the shore, that much of the uncertainty

 at present preA'ailing is due.

               5. Harbours of Befuge. By Robert Capper, F.E.G.iS.

       The writer showed how the anomalies of the present system of shipping dues,^

 varying as they do at almost every port in the kingdom, tend to divert certain

 articles of commerce from Great Britain to foreign ports. He instanced the

 Eastern trade, which at one time centred in London, having been transferred to
 continental ports; and the Australian wool trade, which properly belonged to

 England, was now going to Antwerp ; while a large American trade had found its
 way to Havre. There are about 250 harbours in the United Kingdom governed

 by local authorities, and about 200 creelis and so-called harbours in the hands of
 individual proprietors, which are largely supported and maintained by charges
 upon ships and their cargoes. So compUcated is the system that it is impossible
 to obtain reliable information on the subject of dock charges and the financial

 position of our harbours. He also showed the varying character of pilotage imposts.

 In order to compete with foreign ports our import charges, especially on raw ma-

 terials, must be kept low. He instanced the vexatious divisions and ruling divisions

 of rating in the port of Liverpool, and also pointed out that the reduction by Mr.
 Gladstone, when Chancellor of the Exchequer, in 1853, of the articles contained in the
 customs charges from 400 to 48 had worked with advantage, both to the customs

 authorities and the harbour authorities. He contended that the charges levied on

 shipping in Great Britain were extravagant, and urged that a uniform toll of

 75 per cent, of what was now levied would be sufficient, without going to the

 public exchequer, to provide and maintain harbours of refuge and to conform to all

 the parliamentary requirements as to sinking funds and so on. He held that each

port should bear the cost of its own harbour, but if it were necessary to spend

public funds at all, it should be in improYiug existing harbours of refuge rather

than upon new ones.

         6. The Panama Canal. By the Chevalier de Stoess.

     Passing over the various efforts which have been made since the days of

-- --Cortez and Pizarro a period of fully four centuries to discover a feasible route

for the construction of a canal or waterway across Central America, the author

described, with some details, the various proposals which have from time to time

found favour, down to 1871, when an international congress assembled at Paris

under the presidency of M. de Lesseps, provided with a concession obtained from

the Columbian  Government  in  the previous year                                                                                  and after an exhaustive inquiry
                                                                                                                               ;

decided upon the construction of a canal from the Gulf of Limon to the Bay of

Panama.

     The author then proceeded to describe the work as tlien in progress, with the
latest particulars up to September 14, obtained direct from M. de Lesseps.
