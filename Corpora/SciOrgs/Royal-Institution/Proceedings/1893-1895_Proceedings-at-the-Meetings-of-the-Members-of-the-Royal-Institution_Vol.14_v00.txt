                            Liquid Atmospheric Air.
 The prosecution of research at temperatures approaching the zero of
 absolute temperature is attended with difficulties and dangers of no
 ordinary kind.        Having no recorded experience to guide us in
 conducting   such    investigations, the best instruments and methods of
 working    have   to   be discovered.   The necessity of devising some
 new kind of vessel for storing and manipulating exceedingly volatile
 fluids like liquid oxygen and liquid air, became apparent when the
 optical properties of the bodies came under examination.                The
 liquids, being in active ebullition, were in a condition which rendered
 optical measurements impossible.        All attempts at improvement on
 the principle of using a succession of surrounding       glass vessels, the
 annular space between such vessels having the cool current of the
vapour coming from the boiling liquid led through them, proved a
failure.    Apart altogether from the rapid ebullition interfering
with experimental work, the fact that it took place involved a great
additional cost in the conduct of experiments on the properties of
matter under such exceptional conditions of temperature.
      While suffering great anxiety on the question of expenditure, the
Goldsmiths' Company came forward with the handsome contribution
of 1000J. to continue the work with improved apparatus. Personally,
I   desire to express my grateful thanks to the Goldsmiths' Company
for tendering such encouragement and support.
     On careful consideration it became apparent that the proper way
of attacking the problem was to conduct a series of experiments
on the relative amounts of heat conveyed to boiling liquid gases ;
firstly, by means of the convective transference of heat by the
gas particles, and, secondly, by radiation from surrounding           bodies.
The early experiments of Dulong and Petit on the laws of radiation
had proved the very important part played by the gas particles sur
rounding a body in dissipating heat otherwise than by pure radiation.

Boy. Soc. Ed., vol. xxvii.) and the subsequent investigations of
Crookes, and especially of Bottomley, having confirmed the great
importance to be attached to the gas particles in the gain or loss of
heat, it naturally occurred to me that the use of high vacua surround
ing the vessels containing liquid gases would be advantageous.
In order to arrive at definite data, some means of conducting com
parative experiments between the amount of convective and radiant
heat at such low temperatures had to bo devised.
     The apparatus shown in Fig. 1 measures the relative volumes of gas
distilled in a given time under definite conditions, so that the measure
of the gas distilled is proportional to the amount of heat conveyed
to the liquid.     The experiments are made in the following way : the
distilling vessel to the right consists of two concentric spherical
chambers, the space between being highly exhausted by a mercurial
air-pump.     The inner sphere is filled with liquid ethylene, oxygen,
                                    Fig. 1.
or air, and the whole apparatus immersed in water maintained at a
constant temperature. Distillation begins immediately and continues
at a constant rate provided the liquid in the bulb is maintained at
the same level.       This is not possible, but a sufficient uniformity
is attained by making the observations during the evaporation of the
first fourth of the contents. Having measured the volume of gas
produced per minute when the sphere is surrounded with a high
vacuum, the vessel is taken out of the water, the end nipped off, air
allowed to enter, and then again closed.        In this condition the inner
sphere is filled up again with the liquid and the above experiment
repeated. The following results were obtained, using ethylene and
oxygen respectively :
              Liquid Oxygen, Vacuum ..      .. 170 co. per minute.

                               Air             250 „
     These results prove that under the same conditions a high vacuum

  1893.]                 on   Liquid Atmospheric Air.                     3
 diminishes the rate of evaporation to one-fifth part of what it is
 when the substance is surrounded with air at atmospheric pressure,
 or, in other words, liquid oxygen or ethylene lasts five times longer
 when surrounded with a vacuous space.
     The next step was to construct a series of glass vessels sur
 rounded by a vacuous space, suitable for various experiments, and
 such are represented in Fig. 2. In vessels of this kind, if the vacuum
 is very high, no ice appears on the surface of the outer vessel, even
 although the walls of the vacuous space are within half an inch of
each other, and the liquid oxygen or air evaporates almost solely
from the surface, no bubbles of gas being given off throughout the
 mass of the liquid.    So far the convective transference of heat has
been stopped by the use of a high vacuum, but if the inner vessel
is coated with a bright deposit of silver, then the radiation            is
                                     Fig. 2.
                                                          =^J
diminished also, with the result that the rate of evaporation is
further reduced to more than a half. In such vessels liquid oxygen
or liquid air can be kept for hours, and the economy and ease of
manipulation greatly improved.
     The arrangements represented in Fig. 2 may be employed to
study the law of radiation at low temperatures. All that is necessary
for the purpose is to immerse the outer vessel in liquids maintained
at different temperatures.       The following preliminary results have
been obtained, using oxygen, which boils at — 180° C, in the inner
sphere   : —

These results show that radiation (along           with such convective
transference as remains) grows approximately       at the rate of the cube

of the absolute temperature.         Many farther experiments must,
however, be made before the real law of radiation at low temperatures
can be strictly defined.
    To produce exceedingly high vacua in vessels used for such pur
poses as the collection and storage of liquid air, a mercurial vacuum
made in the following manner has been found highly satisfactory.
Take, as an illustration, a glass vessel shaped like Fig. 3, and
after placing in it a quantity of mercury and connecting the pipe H
with a good working air-pump, place in an oil or air-bath heated
above 200° 0., and distil off a good quantity of the mercury.       While
the distillation is taking place the tube is sealed off at the point A,
and the bulb instantly removed from the heated bath to such an
extent as to allow condensation to take place in the small chamber
marked B W in the figure.       As the air-pump can maintain a vacuum
of ten millimetres, no difficulty arises in sealing the glass tube during
the continuance of the distillation. In some cases the mercury in the
vessel has been heated up to near its boiling point in air, and then
the air-pump started, causing thereby an almost explosive burst of
                       mercurial vapour which very effectually carries
       Fig. 3.         all the air out of the vessel.  After cooling, the
                       vessel is removed from the bath, and the excess
                       of mercury brought into the small bulb B W,
                       care having been taken to remove any small
                       globules of mercury, which adhere with great
                       tenacity to the surface of the glass, by heating
                       K while the part B W is kept cool. In this way
                       the vessel K is filled with nothing but mercurial
                       vapour, the pressure of which depends solely
on the temperature of the liquid mercury contained in the small
enlargement, and as this can, if necessary, be cooled to — 190° 0. by
immersing it in liquid air, we have the means of creating in K a
vacuum of inconceivable tenuity. It is sufficient for the production of
very good vacua to cool the mercury in B W to —80° C. (using solid
carbonic acid as the cooling agent), and while in this condition to seal
off the bulb containing all the condensed mercury, so that K is left
full of saturated vapour at —80° C. When very high exhaustions
are required it is better not to seal off the mercury bulb, as the
glass is apt to give off some kind of vapour.         A similar mode of
proceeding is adopted when other shaped vessels have to be highly
exhausted, and no difficulty has arisen in operating with vessels
having the capacity of more than a litre.
     The perfection of the vacuum, assuming that nothing remains but
molecules of mercury in the form of vapour, depends upon the tem
perature to which the subsidiary bulb is cooled.         The well-known
law which expresses approximately the relation between temperature
and pressure in the case of saturated vapours, must be assumed to be
applicable to mercury vapour at temperatures where direct measure
ment becomes impossible.        Having calculated the constants of a

  1893.]                 on Liquid Atmospheric Air.                         6
  vapour pressure formula from observed data at high temperatures,
  it is easy to arrive at      a value of the vapour pressure for any
 assumed lower temperature.          Such a formula as the following,
 log.  P = 15-1151    -  2-2931, log.  T  - ?^?      , where  P is pressure
 in millimetres of mercury and T is the absolute temperature, agrees
                                               -
 well with the experimental results. This formula gives the vapour
 pressure at 0° C. as 0-000 18 mill., and at      80° C. as 0-000,000,003
 mill., or respectively, about the sixth and the four hundred thousandth
 of a millionth of an atmosphere. Such a high vacuum could never be
 reached by the use of any form of mercurial air-pump.         The electric
discharge in such vacua produces intense phosphorescence of the glass,
 giving thereby a continuous spectrum, which makes the detection of
 the mercury lines difficult.
      Consider for a moment the proofs that could be adduced that
 mercury vapour, even below a millionth of an atmosphere pressure,
can behave like an ordinary saturated vapour. The most character
 istic property of a space filled with any saturated vapour is that
 cooling to a lower temperature causes partial condensation of the
 vapour in the form of liquid or solid.       The amount of vapour in a
 mercurial vacuum at the ordinary temperature would weigh about
 the tenth of a milligram in the volume of a litre, and to see such an
 amount of the metal it would require to be concentrated on a
 small area in the form of a fine metallic film.          Experiment    has
 shown that the fifth of a milligram of gold may be made to cover
 one square centimetre of surface, so that a minute quantity             of
 metal can be observed if properly deposited.         This can be easily
achieved in such mercurial vacua by cooling a small portion of the
 surface of the glass to the temperature of — 180° C. by the applica
tion of a pad of cotton wool saturated with liquid oxygen.           In an
instant the vapour of mercury deposits in the form of a brilliant
mirror, which, on the temperature rising, becomes subdivided into a
mass of exceedingly minute spheres of liquid.             A repetition of
the cooling    does  not  bring  down  a new   mirror,  provided the first
area is maintained cool, but if the vessel contains excess of liquid
mercury any number of mirrors of mercury may be deposited in
succession.
     Mercury is thus proved to distil at the ordinary temperature
when the vapour pressure is under the millionth of an atmosphere.
Further, it is easy to prove in this way that the cooling of the
liquid mercury in "such a subsidiary vessel (which has been de
scribed as a temporary part of the vacuum vessel) greatly improves
the vacuum.     For this purpose it is sufficient to cool the said vessel
with some solid carbonic acid, and then to try and reproduce a
mirror of mercury in the way previously described. No mercury
mirror can be formed so long as the cold bath is maintained.           If a
piece of blotting paper, cut   into any desired shape,  be moistened  with
water, and then applied to the surface of one of the vacuum vessels

containing excess of liquid mercury, the local reduction of tempera
ture produced by the evaporation soon causes a rough image of the
paper to appear in the form of minute globules of condensed mercury.
Such experiments support the view that the laws of saturated vapours
are maintained at very low pressures.
    In Fig. 4 specimens of the old and new vessels for collecting and
manipulating liquid gases are shown.      In each of the old forms it

will  be noted that a mass of phosphoric anhydride placed in the
lower portion is required to absorb traces of water, otherwise the
vessels are useless for optical observations.    The vacuum receivers
 get over this difficulty.
     The perfection of the vacuum in different vessels, all treated in
the same way, differs very much, and after use they almost invariably
deteriorate.   The relative rates of evaporation of liquid oxygen under
the same conditions in different vessels is the best test of the vacuum.
In many of the large vessels used for the storage of liquid gases, it

 is convenient and more effective to cause the deposition of a mercury
 mirror over the surface of the inner vessel (by leaving a little liquid
 mercury in the lower part of the double-shaped flask), instead of
 silvering as previously described. Under such conditions the mer
cury instantly distils and forms a brilliant mirror all over the surface
 of the inner vessel.    The fact that mercury has a very high refrac
 tive index and is a bad conductor of heat are factors of importance
in retarding the conveyance of heat. After the mercury mirror
has been formed any further increase in the thickness of the film
can be prevented, and at the same time the vacuum improved by
 freezing the excess of liquid mercury in the lower part of the vessel.
The vacuum vessels described equally retard the loss as well as the
 gain of heat, and are admirably adapted for all kinds of calorimetric
observations.    The future use of these vessels
in thermal observations will add greatly to                    Fiq5.
the accuracy and ease of conducting investiga
tions.   The double spherical form of vacuum
vessel is excellent for showing that the elevation
or depression of a given volume of air a few feet
causes an increase or diminution of volume, due
 to the small change of atmospheric pressure.
 The volume of air in the inner sphere is guarded
from any sudden change of temperature by the
surrounding highly vacuous space.        This is only
one of the many uses to which such receivers can
be put.
     In making vacua, many other substances have
been examined along with mercury, but they have
 not given equally satisfactory results.
     Sulphur would occur to any one as a substance
that might replace mercury, seeing the density
 in the form of vapour, and also the latent heat
of vaporisation, are nearly identical ; and it has
 the further advantage of being a solid at ordinary
 temperatures. The sulphur vacua have, however,
so far not been an improvement, chiefly because traces of organic matter
are decomposed by the sulphur, giving sulphuretted hydrogen and sul
 phurous acid, gases which are dissolved by and remain in the sulphur.
     When the surface of such a sulphur vacuum is cooled with
liquid oxygen in the manner previously described, a faint crys
talline deposit occurs, only it takes a much longer time to appear
 than in the case of the mercury vacuum.          If  a similar vessel is
boiled out, using phosphorus as the volatile substance, the application
of liquid oxygen to the surface causes instant deposition.        Thus it
can be proved sulphur and phosphorus distil at ordinary temperatures
just like mercury.

alloys, and carbon at low temperatures has been undertaken iu

                 illustration.       As the critical point of oxygen is some
                 thirty degrees higher than nitrogen it is easier to liquefy,
                 and, consequently, becomes the most convenient substance
                 to use for the production of temperatures about — 200° C.
                 Liquid nitrogen, carbonic oxide, or air can conveniently
                 be made at the ordinary atmospheric pressure, provided
                 they are brought into a vessel cooled by liquid oxygen
                 boiling under the pressure of about half an inch of
                 mercury.
                      A simple arrangement for this purpose is shown in
                  Fig. 8. The inner tube contains the liquid oxygen under
exhaustion, surrounded by a vacuum vessel, the interior space between
 the inner tube and the vacuum vessel being connected with a
 receiver containing the gas which is to be liquefied.                If the object
 is to collect liquid air, the inner air space is left quite open, no
 precautions being needed to free the air from carbonic acid or
 moisture, because under the conditions such substances are solids,
 and only cause a slight opalescence in the liquid, which drops con
 tinuously from the end of the inner tube and accumulates in the
 vacuum vessel.          If   the air supply is forced to bubble through a
 little strong sulphuric acid, the rate of condensation and the rela
 tive volume of gas and liquid can bo observed.                  Liquid air boils
 at the temperature of — 190° C, giving off substantially pure nitrogen.

As the nitrogen boils 10° 0. lower than oxygen, after a time the
liquid alters its composition and boiling point, finally becoming
pare oxygon.    During the evaporation the liquid air changes very
remarkably in colour, passing from a very faint blue to a much
deeper shade.    The changes can be traced best by the marked
increase in the width of the absorption bands of liquid oxygen.       If
air, collected in the above manner in a vacuum vessel, is isolated
from a rapid heat supply by immersing the vessel in liquid oxygen,

transparency of liquid oxygen can be shown by passing the radiation

by immersing an electric pile, composed of carbon and sodium, into
liquid oxygen, when almost immediately the electric current ceases.
The gaseous oxygen coming from the liquid must be exceedingly
pure and dry, and as     ithas been alleged two chemical substances

bustion continued active, and for a time could be maintained in the
middle of the liquid oxygen. This result suggests that oxygen and
 sulphur can enter into combination in a perfectly dry condition.
 Some notion of the temperature of liquid air is given by running
on to the surface some absolute alcohol, which, after rolling about
in the spheroidal state, suddenly solidifies into a hard transparent ice,
which rattles on the sides of the vacuum test-tube like a marble.
On lifting the solid alcohol out by means of a looped wire the appli
cation of the flame of a Bunsen burner will not ignite it. After a
time the solid melts and falls from the looped wire like a thick
syrup.
     It is not the question of the change of state in matter, however
interesting, that in our day has special attractions for the chemist,
but the means of studying the properties of matter generally under
the conditions of such exceptionally low temperatures as are the con
comitants of the transition in the case of substances like oxygen and
nitrogen.    The work of investigation in this field proceeds slowly but
surely, and one need not despair (unless on the grounds of expense)
in the future of adding further data to our knowledge of the pro
perties of matter near the zero of absolute temperature.

dangers and difficulties of this kind of research, and it becomes a

                       The Just- Perceptible Difference.
"We seem to onrselves to belong to two worlds, which are governed
by entirely different laws; the world of feeling and the world of
matter — the psychical and the physical — whose mutual relations are
the subject of the science of Psycho-physics, in which the just-per
ceptible difference plays a large part.
      It will be explained in the first of the two principal divisions of
 this lecture that the study of just-perceptible differences leads us not
 only up to, but beyond, the frontier of the mysterious region of mental
 operations which are not vivid enough to rise above the threshold of
 consciousness.      It will there be shown how important a part ia
 commonly played by the imagination in producing faint sensations,
 and how its power on those occasions admits of actual measurement.
      The last part of the lecture will deal with the limits of the power
 of optical discrimination, as shown by the smallest number of adjacent
 dots that suffice to give the appearance of a continuous line, and the
 feasibility will be explained of transmitting very beautiful outline
 drawings of a minute size, and larger and rougher plans, maps, and
 designs of all kinds, by means of telegraphy.
      Material objects are measurable by external standards, about
  which it is sufficient to say that when we speak of a pound, a yard, or
 an hour, we use terms whose meanings are defined and understood in
 the same sense by all physicists.       The feelings, on the other hand,
  cannot be measured by external standards, so we are driven to use
  internal ones, and to adopt a scale of sensation formed by units of
 just-perceptible differences, rising in the arithmetical order of 1, 2, 3,
  Ax., and by their side a scale of measurements of the stimuli that
  provoked them.       The attempts of those who first experimentalised
  in Psycho-physics were mainly directed to ascertain the relation
  between the increase of stimulus and the corresponding increment of
  sensation.
      Their net result has been to confirm, within moderate limits, the
  trustworthiness of Weber's law, namely, that each successive incre
  ment of sensation is caused by the same percentage increment of the
  previous stimulus.
      The rate at which a stimulus must be increased in order to give a

just-perceptible increment of sensation, has been taken at the average
of 1 per cent. for light, 6 per cent, for muscular effort, 33 per cent,
for sound and warmth ; also 33 per cent, for pressure upon most parts
of the body, and as high as 16 per cent, upon the finger tips. But
 these values must not be trusted too far; they cease to be exact
 towards the two ends of the scale.
      A mechanical arrangement clearly illustrates the consequences of
 Weber's law. It includes an axle to which is fixed a wheel, a part
 of a logarithmic spiral, and an index hand.           This portion of the
 machine is carefully balanced, so that it will remain steady in any
 position in which it is set, while a small force is sufficient to cause it to
 turn ; behind all is a card with equal graduations upon      it, over which
 the index travels.        A string, with  a  scale pan at one end and       a
 counterpoise at the other,   is    wrapped round the wheel.        A string
 fastened to the axle passes over the logarithmic arm, and a ball            is
 fastened to its free end.      The varying weights put in the scalo pan
 will now represent varying amounts of stimulus, and the graduations
 to which the index points, represent the corresponding variations of
 sensation.

  to give exact indications, but still sufficient for rough explanatory
 purposes.
      Owing to the obvious properties of spiral, the more the axle to

  further does the point at which the string       is   hanging travel away
  from the axis, and the leverage exerted by the weight of the ball will
  increase.    Whatever be the weight in the scale pan, there       is within
  the working range of the apparatus some position of the beam at
  which that weight will be counterbalanced by the ball. The pro
  perty of the logarithmic spiral     is   that equal degrees of rotation
  correspond to equal percentage increments of leverage. Hence, when
  percentage increments of weight are successively placed in the scale
  pan, the index attached to the beam will successively travel over
  equal divisions of the scale, in accordance with Weber's formula.
      The progressive increase in the effective length of the logarithmic
  armis   small at first, but
                            is   seen soon to augment rapidly, and then to
  become extravagant.         We thus gain     a vivid insight through this
  piece   of  mechanism    into the  enormous   increase  of stimulus, when
         already large, that      required to produce     fresh increment of
it

  sensation, and how soon the time must arrive when the organ of
  sense, like the machine, will break down under the strain rather than
  admit of being goaded farther.
       The result of all this is, that although the senses may perceive
   very small stimuli, and can endure very large ones without suffering
   damage, the number of units in the scale of sensation    is comparatively
   small.    The hugest increase of good fortune will not make           aman
   who is    already well off many degrees happier than before; the
   utmost torture that can be applied to him will not give much greater

pain than he has already sometimes suffered. The experience of a
life that we call uneventful usually includes a large share of the
utmost possible range of human pleasures and human pains. Thus the
physiological law which is expressed by Weber's formula is a great
leveller, by preventing the diversities of fortune from creating by
any means so great a diversity in human happiness.
     The least-perceptible difference varies considerably in different
persons, delicacy of perception being a usual criterion of superiority
of nature. The sense of pain is curiously blunt in idiots. It varies
also in the same person with his health, and extraordinarily so in
hysteria and hypnotism, at which times sensitivity is sometimes
almost absent, and at other times exceptionally acute. It is somewhat
affected by drugs.        Thus Dr. Lauder Brunton writes concerning
strychnine, that when taken in small doses for a long time, the im
pressions are felt more keenly and are of longer duration.       The sense
of touch is rendered more acute; the field of vision is increased,
distant objects are more distinct, and the senso of hearing is
sharpened.      (Pharmacology, 1885, p. 888.)
     Other drugs or intoxicants may yet      be discovered and legitimately
used to heighten the sensitivity, or indeed any other faculty during a
 brief period, in order to perform that which could not otherwise be
 performed at all, at the cheap price of a subsequent period of fatigue.
      Measure of the Imagination. — The first perceptible sensation is
 seldom due to a solitary stimulus.      Internal causes of stimulation are
 in continual activity, whose effects are usually too faint to be per
 ceived by themselves, but they may combine with minute external
 stimuli, and so produce a sensation which neither of them could have
 done singly.     I desire now to draw attention to another concurring
 cause which has hitherto been unduly overlooked, or only partially
 allowed for under the titles of Expectation and Attention.          I mean
 the Imagination, believing that it should be frankly recognised as a
 frequent factor in the production of a just-perceptible sensation.     Let
 us reflect for a moment on the frequency with which the imagination
 produces effects that actually overpass the threshold of consciousness,
 and give rise to what is indistinguishable from, and mistaken for, a
 real sensation.    Every one has observed instances of it in his own
           and in those of others.     Illustrations are almost needless;
    may, however, mention one as a reminder ; it was current in my
 rtrson
  boyhood, and the incident probably took place not many yards from
  where   I  now stand.    Sir Humphry Davy had recently discovered
  the metal potassium, and showed specimens of it to the greedy gaze
  of a philosophical friend as it lay immersed in a dish of alcohol to
  shield it from the air, explaining its chemical claim to be considered
  a metal. All the known metals at that time were of such high specific
  gravity that weight was commonly considered to be a peculiar
  characteristic of metals ; potassium, however, is lighter than water.
  The philosopher not being aware of this, but convinced as to its
  metallic nature by the reasoning of Sir Humphry, fished a piece out

     In childhood the imagination is peculiarly vivid, and notoriously
leads to mistakes, but the discipline of after life is steadily directed
to checking its vagaries and to establishing a clear distinction
between fancy and fact.         Nevertheless, the force of the imagination
may endure with extraordinary power and even be cherished by
persons of poetic temperament, on which point the experiences of our
two latest Poets-Laureate, Wordsworth and Tennyson, are extremely
instructive.    Wordsworth's famous " Ode to Immortality
                                                                           " contains
three lines which long puzzled his readers.                  They occur after his
grand description of the glorious imagery of childhood, and the
" perpetual benediction " of its memories, when he suddenly breaks
off into —
                     " Not   for these  I raise
                       The song of thanks and praise,

                               should any sane person be " obstinately

     Why, it was     asked,
disposed to question the testimony of his senses, and be peculiarly
thankful that he had the power to do so ? What was meant by the
" fallings off and vanishings," for which he raises his " song of thanks
 and praise"?      The explanation is now to be found in a note by
 Wordsworth himself, prefixed to the ode in Knight's edition. Words

 worth there writes, " was often unable to think of external things
as having external existence, and               I communed with all         I   saw as
 something not apart from, but inherent in, my own immaterial nature.
 Many times while going to school have 1 grasped at a wall or tree to
 recall myself from this abyss of idealism to the reality. At that time
 I  was afraid of such processes.                               I
                                             In later times have deplored, as
 we all have reason to do, a subjugation of an opposite character, and
have rejoiced over the remembrances, as is expressed in the lines
 ' Obstinate

     It is a remarkable coincidence that a closely similar idea is found
 in the verses of the successor of Wordsworth, namely, the great poet
 whose recent loss is mourned by all English-speaking nations, and
 that a closely similar explanation exists with respect to them. For
 in Lord Tennyson's " Holy Grail " the aged Sir Percivale, then a
 monk, recounts to a brother monk the following words of King
 Arthur : —
                 " Let visions of the night or of the day
                   Come, as they will ; and many a time they come

     Sir Percivale concludes just as Wordsworth's admirers formerly
               I
had done : " knew not all he meant."
     Now, in the Nineteenth Century of the present month Mr. Knowles,
in his article entitled " Aspects of Tennyson," mentions a conversa
tional incident curiously parallel to Wordsworth's            own remarks
about himself : — " He [Tennyson] said to me one day, ' Sometimes as
I  sit alone in this great room       I get carried away, out of sense and
body, and rapt into mere existence, till the accidental touch or
movement of one of my own fingers is like a great shock and blow,
                                                      "
and brings the body back with a terrible start.'
     Considering how often the imagination is sufficiently intense to
mimic a real sensation, a vastly greater number of cases must
exist in which it excites the physiological centres in too feeble a
degree for their response to reach to the level of consciousness.        So
that if the imagination has been anyhow set into motion, it shall, as
a rule, originate what may be termed incomplete sensations, and
whenever one of these concurs with a real sensation of the same kind,
it would swell its volume.
     This supposition admits of being submitted to experiment by
comparing the amount of stimulus required to produce a just-per
ceptible sensation, under the two conditions of the imagination being
either excited or passive.
     Several conditions have to be observed in designing suitable
experiments.     The imagined sensation and the real sensation must be
of the same quality ; an expected scream and an actual groan could
not reinforce one another.          Again, the place where the image is
localised in the theatre of the imagination must be the same as it is
 in the real sensation.    This condition requires to be more carefully
 regarded in respect to the visual imagination than to that of tha
other senses, because the theatre of the visual imagination is described
 by most persons, though not by all, as internal, whereas the theatre
of actual vision is external.      The important part played by points of
reference   in visual  illusions  is to be explained by the aid they afford
 in compelling the imaginary figures to externalise themselves, super
imposing them on fragments of a reality.            Then the visualisation
and the actual vision fuse together        in some   parts, and supplement
each other   elsewhere.
     The theatre of audition is by no means so purely external as that
of sight. Certain persuasive tones of voice sink deeply, as it were,
into the mind, and even simulate our own original sentiments. The
power of localising external sounds, which is almost absent in those
who are deaf with one ear, is very imperfect generally, otherwise the
illusions of the ventriloquist would be impossible.           There was an
account in the newspapers a few weeks ago of an Austrian lady of
rank who purchased a parrot at a high price, as being able to repeat
the Paternoster in seven different languages.            She took the bird
home, but it was mute.        At last it was discovered that the apparent
performances of the parrot had been due to the ventriloquism of the
     Vol. XIV      (No. 87.)                                       o

                             Mr. Francis Oalton                  [Jan. 27,
dealer.    An analogous trick upon the sight could not be performed
by a conjuror.     Thus he could never make his audience believe that
the floor of the room was the ceiling.
     As regards the other senses, the theatre of the imagination coin
cides fairly well with that of the sensations.    It is so with taste and
smell, also with touch, in so far that an imagined impression or pain
is always located in some particular part of the body, then if it be
localised in the same place as a real pain it must coalesce with it.
     Finally, it is of high importance to success in experiments on
Imagination that the object and its associated imagery should be so
habitually connected that a critical attitude of the mind shall not
easily separate them.       Suppose an apparatus arranged to associate
the waxing and waning of a light with the rising and falling of a
sound, holding means in reserve for privately modifying the illumi
nation at the will of the experimenter, in order that the waxing and
waning may be lessened, abolished, or even reversed. It is quite
possible that a person who had no idea of the purport of the experi
ment might be deceived, and be led by his imagination to declare
that the light still waxed and waned in unison with the sound after
its ups and downs had been reduced to zero. But if the subject of
the experiment suspected its object, he would be thrown into a critical
mood ; his mind would stiffen itself, as it were, and he would be
difficult to deceive.
     Having made these preliminary remarks, T will mention one only
of some experiments    I   have made and am making from time to time,
to measure the force of my own imagination.             It happens that
although most persons train themselves from childhood upwards to
distinguish imagination from fact, there is at least one instance in
which we do the exact reverse, namely, in respect to the auditory
presentation of the words that are perused by the eye.        It would be
otherwise impossible to realise the sonorous flow of the passages,
whether in prose or poetry, that are read only with the eyes.       We all
of us value and cultivate this form of auditory imagination, and it
commonly grows into a well-developed faculty.       I infer that when we
are listening to the words of a reader while our eyes are simultane
ously perusing a copy of the book from which he is reading, that
 the effects of the auditory imagination concur with the actual sound,
and produce a stronger impression than the latter alone would be
able to make.
     I have very frequently experimented on myself with success, with
the view of analysing this concurrent impression into its constituents,
being aided thereto by two helpful conditions, the one is a degree of
deafness which prevents me when sitting on a seat in the middle
rows from following memoirs that are read in tones suitable to the
audience at large ; and the other is the accident of belonging to
societies in which unrevised copies of the memoirs that are about to
be read, usually in a monotonous voice, are obtainable, in order to be
perused simultaneously by the eye.       Now it sometimes happens that

  1893.]                 on The  Just-Perceptible Difference.                  19
 portions of these papers, however valuable they may be in themselves,
 do not interest me, in which case it has been a never-flagging source
 of diversion to compare my capabilities of following the reader when
 I am using my eyes, and when         I am not.    The result depends some
 what on the quality of the voice ; if it be a familiar tone              I  can
 imagine what is coming much more accurately than otherwise.                   It
depends much on the phraseology, familiar words being vividly re
presented.      Something also depends on the mood at the time, for
imagination is powerfully affected by all forms of emotion.                 The
result is that    I frequently find myself in a position in which        I  hear
every word distinctly so long as they accord with those                   I   am
perusing, but whenever a word is changed, although the change is
perceived, the new word is not recognised.           Then, should   I raise my
eyes from the copy, nothing whatever of the reading can be under
stood, the overtones by which words are distinguished being too faint
to be heard.        As a rule,   I  estimate that   I  have to approach the
reader by about a quarter of the previous distance, before               I   can
distinguish his words by the ear alone.               Accepting this rough
estimate for the purposes of present calculation, it follows that the
potency of my hearing alone is to that of my hearing plus imagina
tion as the loudness of the same overtones heard at 3 and at 4 units
of distance respectively ; that is as about 32 to 42, or as 9 to 16.
Consequently the potency of my auditory imagination is to that of a
just-perceptible sound as 16 — 9 to 16, or as 7 units to 16. So the effect
of the imagination in this case reaches nearly half-way to the level of
consciousness.       If it were a little more than twice as strong it would
be able by itself to produce an effect indistinguishable from a real
sound.
     Two copies of the same newspaper afford easily accessible
materials for making this experiment, a few words having been
altered here and there in the copy to be read from.
     I will conclude this portion of my remarks by suggesting that
some of my audience should repeat these experiments on themselves.
If  they do so,   I should be grateful if they would communicate to me
their results.
     Optical Continuity. — Keenness of sight is measured by the angular
distance apart of two dots when they can only just be distinguished
as two, and do not become confused together.           It is usually reckoned
that the normal eye is just able or just unable to distinguish points
that lie one minute of a degree asunder.              Now, one minute of a
degree   is the  angle  subtended   by  two points, separated by the 300th
part of an inch, when they are viewed at the ordinary reading distance
of one foot from the eye.       If, then, a row of fine dots touching one
another, each as small as a bead of one 300th part of an inch in
diameter, be arranged on the page of a book, they would appear to
the ordinary reader to be an almost invisibly fine and continuous line.
If the dots be replaced by short cross strokes, the line would look
broader, but its apparent continuity would not be affected.          It is im
                                                                   o 2

possible to draw any line that shall commend itself to the eye as
possessing more regularity than the image of a succession of dots or
cross strokes, 300 to the inch, when viewed at the distance of a foot.
Every design, however delicate, that can be drawn with a line of
uniform thickness by the best machine or the most consummate artist,
admits of being mimicked by the coarsest chain, when it is viewed at
such a distance that the angular length of each of its links shall not
exceed one minute of a degree.         One of the apparently smoothest
outlines in nature is that of the horizon of the sea during ordinary
weather, although it is formed by waves.       The slopes of debris down
the sides of distant mountains appear to sweep in beautifully smooth
curves, but on reaching those mountains and climbing up the debris,
the path may be exceedingly rough.
      The members of an audience sit at such various distances from the
lecture table and screen that it is not possible to illustrate as well as
 is desirable the stages through which a row of dots appears to run
 into a continuous line, as the angular distance between the dots is
 lessened.   I  have, however, hung up chains and rows of beads of
 various degrees of coarseness. Some of these will appear as pure
 lines to all the audience ; others, whose coarseness of structure is
 obvious to those who sit nearest, will seem to be pure lines when
 viewed from the farthest seats.
      Although 300 dots to the inch are required to give the idea of
 perfect continuity at the distance of one foot, it will shortly be seen
 that a much smaller number suffices to suggest it.
      The cyclostyle, which is an instrument used for multiple writing,
 makes about 140 dots to the inch.       The style has a minute spur-
 wheel or roller, instead of a point ; the writing is made on stencil
 paper, whose surface is covered with a brittle glaze.      This is per
 forated by the teeth of the spur-wheel wherever they press against it.
 The half perforated sheet is then laid on writing paper, and an inked
 roller is worked over the glaze. The ink passes through the per
 forations and soaks through them on to the paper below ; consequently
 the impression consists entirely of short and irregular cross bars or
 dots.
      I exhibit on the screen a circular letter summoning a committee,
 that was written by the cyclostyle.     The writing seems beautifully
 regular when the circular is photographically reduced ; when it is
  enlarged, the discontinuity of the strokes becomes conspicuous.
         I
  Thus, have enlarged the word the six times ; the dots can then be
  easily seen and counted.    There are 42 of them in the long stroke of
 the letter h.
      The appearance of the work done by the cyclostyle would be
  greatly improved if a fault in its mechanism could be removed, which
 causes it to run with very unequal freedom in different directions.   It
 leaves an ugly, jagged mark wherever the direction of a line changes
 suddenly.
     A much coarser representation of continuous lines is given by

1893.]               on The Just-Perceptible   Difference.                   21
embroidery and tapestry, and coarser still by those obsolete school
samplers which our ancestresses worked in their girlhood, with an
average of about sixteen stitched dots to each letter. Perhaps the
coarsest lettering, or rather figuring, that is ever practically em
ployed is used in perforating the books of railway coupons so familiar
to travellers.   Ten or eleven holes are used for each figure.
     A good test of the degree of approximation with which a cyclostyle
making 140 perforations to the inch is able to simulate continuous
lines, is to use it for drawing outline portraits.         I
                                                          asked the clerk
who wrote the circular just exhibited to draw me a few profiles of
different sizes, ranging from the smallest scale on which the cyclostyle
could produce recognisable features, up to the scale at which it acted
fairly well.   I submit some specimens of the result.       The largest is
                J
a portrait of 1 inches in height, by which facial characteristics are
fairly well conveyed ; somewhat better than by the rude prints that
appear occasionally in the daily papers.       It is formed by 366 dots.
                    j
A medium size is inch high and contains 177 dots, and would be
tolerable if it were not for the jagged strokes already spoken of. The
smallest sizes are J inch high and contain about 90 dots ; they are
barely passable, on account of the jagged flaws, even for the rudest
portraiture.
     I made experiments under fairer conditions than those of the
cyclostyle, to learn how many dots, discs, or rings per inch were
really needed to produce a satisfactory drawing, and also to discover
how far the centres of the dots or discs might deviate from a strictly
smooth curve without ceasing to produce the effect of a flowing line.
It must be recollected that the eye can perceive nothing finer than
a minute blur of one 300th part of an inch in angular diameter.         If
                                                                        we
represent a succession of such blurs by a chain of larger discs, it will be
easily recognised that a small want of exactitude in the alignments of
the successive discs must be unimportant.      If   one of them is pushed
upwards a trifle and another downwards, so large a part of their
respective areas still remains in line, that when the several discs
become of only just perceptible magnitude, the projecting portion
will be wholly invisible.     When the discs are so large as to be plainly
perceptible, the alignment has to be proportionately more exact.
After a few trials it seemed that if the bearing of the centre of each

NE., &c., it   was fairly sufficient.   Consequently   a simple record of
the successive bearings of each of  a   series of small equidistant steps
is enough to define a   curve.
     The briefest way of writing down these bearings           to assign
                                                               is            a

profiles, and making a small protractor with a piece of tracing paper,
rapidly laid down a series of equidistant points on the above
principle, noting at the same time the bearing of each from its
predecessor.     I thereby obtained a formula for the profile, consisting
of 271 letters. Then         I  put aside the drawing, and set to work to
reproduce it solely from the formula.          I exhibit the result ; it is
fairly successful.      Emboldened by this first trial,   I  made a more
ambitious attempt, by dealing with the profile of a Greek girl copied
from a gem.         I was very desirous of learning how far the pure
outline of the original admitted of being mimicked in this rough way.
 The result is here    ; a ring has been painted round each dot in order
 to make   its position clearly seen, without obliterating it. The repro
 duction has been photographically reduced to various different sizes.
 That which contains only fifty dots to the inch, which is consequently
 six times as coarse as the theoretical 300 to an inch, is a very
 creditable production.        Many persons to whom this portrait has been
 shown, failed to notice the difference between it and an ordinary
 woodcut.      The medium size, and much more the smallest size, would
 deceive anybody who viewed them at the distance of one foot. The
 protractor used in making them was a square card with a piece cut

out of its middle, over which transparent tracing paper was pasted.             A
small hole of about -| of an inch in diameter was punched out of the
centre of the tracing paper ; sixteen minute holes just large enough
 to allow the entry of the sharp point of a hard lead-pencil were
 perforated through the tracing paper in a circle round the centre of
 the hole at a radius of £ inch. They corresponded to the sixteen princi
pal points of the compass, and had their appropriate letters written
by their sides. The outline to be formulated was fixed to a drawing-
 board, with a T rule laid across it as a guide to the eye in keeping
the protractor always parallel to itself.          The centre of the small hole
was then brought over the beginning of the outline, and a dot was
made with the pencil through the perforation nearest to the further
course of the outline, and this became the next point of departure.
While moving the protractor from the old point to the new one it
was stopped on the way, in order that the letter for the bearing
might be written through the central hole.                 These were afterwards
copied on a separate piece of paper.
     A clear distinction must be made between the proposed plan and
that of recording the angle made by each step from the preceding one.
In the latter case, any error of bearing would falsify the direction of
all that followed, like a bend in a wire.
     The difficulties of dealing with detached portions of the drawing,
such as the eye, were easily surmounted by employing two of the
spare letters, It and S, to indicate brackets, and other spare letters to
indicate points of reference.            The bearings included between an B
and an S were taken to signify directive dots, not to be inked in.
The points of reference indicated by other letters are those to which
the previous bearing leads, and from which the next bearing departs.
Here is the formula whence the eye was drawn.                  It includes a very
small part of the profile of the brow, and the directive dots leading
thence to the eye.
    The letters should be read from the left to the right, across the
vertical lines.        They are broken into groups of five, merely for
avoiding confusion and for the convenience of after reference.

may be justly inferred that rougher designs can be easily dealt with
in the same way.
     At first sight it may seem to be a silly waste of time and trouble
to translate a drawing into a formula, and then, working backwards,
to retranslate the formula into a reproduction of the original drawing,
but further reflection shows that the process may be of much practical
utility. Let us bear two facts in mind, the one is that a very large
quantity of telegraphic information is daily published in the papers,
anticipating the post by many days or weeks.                The other is that
pictorial  illustrations   of current  events, of a rude  kind, but acceptable
to the reader, appear from time to time in the daily papers.               We
may   be  sure  that  the quantity  of telegraphic intelligence  will  steadily
increase, and that the art of newspaper illustration will improve and
be more resorted to.       Important local events frequently occur in far-
off regions, of which no description can give an exact idea without
the help of pictorial illustration; some catastrophe, or site of a
battle, or an exploration, or it may be some design or even some
portrait.    There is therefore reason to expect a demand for such
drawings    as these by telegraph, if their expense does not render it
impracticable to have them.         Let us then go into details of expense,
on the basis of the present tariff from America to this country, of one
shilling per word, 5 figures counting as one word, cypher letters not
being sent at a corresponding rate. It requires two figures to per
form each of the operations described above, which were performed
by a single letter.      So a formula for 5 dots would require 10 figures,
which is the telegraphic equivalent of 2 words ; therefore the cost
for every 5 dots telegraphed from the United States would be
2 shillings, or 11. for every 100 dots or other indications.
     In the Greek outline there is a total of 400 indications, including
those for directive dots, and for points of reference. The transmis
sion of these to us from the United States would cost SI.             I exhibit
a map of England made with 248 dots, as a specimen of the amount
of work in plans, which could be effected at the cost of 51. It is easy
to arrange counters into various patterns or parts of patterns, learning
thereby the real power of the process.              The expense of pictorial
telegraphs to foreign countries would be large in itself, but not large
relatively to the present great expenditure by newspapers on tele
graphic information, so the process might be expected to be employed
whenever it was of obvious utility.
     The risk is small of errors of importance arising from mistakes
in telegraphy.      I  inquired into the experience of the Meteorological
Office,  whose   numerous weather telegrams are wholly conveyed by
numerical signals.       Of the 20,625 figures that were telegraphed this
year to the office from continental stations, only 49 seem to have
been erroneous, that is two and a third per thousand.             At this rate
the 800 figures needed to telegraph the Greek profile would have
been liable to two mistakes.           A mistake in a figure would have
exactly the same effect on the outline as a rent in the paper on which

1893.]             on The Just-Perceptible              Difference.                   25
a similar outline had been drawn, which had not                     been pasted together
again with perfect precision.    The dislocation                     thereby occasioned
would never exceed the thickness of the outline.
    The command of 100 figures from 0 to             99, instead of only
26 letters, puts 74 fresh signals at our disposal, which would enable
os to use all the 32 points of the compass, instead of 16, and to deal
with long lines and curves.           I
                                    cannot enter into this now, nor into
the control of the general accuracy of the picture by means of the
distances between the points of triangles each formed by any three
points of reference. Neither need              I
                                           speak of better forms of pro
tractor.    There is one on the table by which the ghost of a compass
card is thrown on the drawing.       It is made of a doubly refracting
                                                                        "

                                All that wish now to explain is that
this peculiar application of the law of the just-perceptible difference
to optical continuity gives us a new power that has practical
bearings.

medium, short, or very short steps can be taken according to the
character of the lineation at any point ; there is no trouble about
orientation ; the bearings are defined without a protractor, the work
can be easily revised, and the correctness of the records may be
checked by comparing the sums of the successive small co-ordinates
leading to a point of reference, with their total value as read off
directly.

                      (With Experimental Illustrations.)
When     I  was requested to give a Friday evening discourse at this
Institution,   I felt very much honoured at having an opportunity of
speaking to an audience that has listened to so many illustrious men
of science.                       I
                At the same time felt that instead of selecting a purely
scientific subject   I should be more likely to interest you if    I drew
your attention to some illustrations of the way in which science is
applied   to practice.
    The tendency of our century, and especially of the latter half, has
been to obliterate ancient distinctions, and to break down barriers
which formerly were held to be insurmountable.           In this respect  I
need only remind you that at one time, in chemistry, substances were
divided    into acids and bases, into metals and metalloids, and that
until very lately in physics, some gases were classed by themselves
as being permanent, and so on.      All of these distinctions have been
found untenable in the light of modern research, and in a similar
manner the strict divisions maintained for a long time between
different branches of science have been more and more abolished, so
that nowadays anybody who wishes to excel in any one branch of
science ought to possess solid knowledge of the principles of all the
others.
    One of the most important barriers broken down by the spirit of
our times is that formerly held up between science and practice, and
the state of mind in which a learned professor once exclaimed about
his own particular branch of science : " Thank goodness, there is no
practical application of it possible," is more and more forgotten.
Instead of that, endeavours are now made on all sides to turn to
practical account all scientific investigations.
     While quite admitting that it would give much cause for regret if
this tendency were developed too far, so as to interfere with the pro •
gress of purely scientific researches, it cannot be denied that the
application of scientific principles has brought about that immense
progress which is characteristic of the last half-century.     A conspicu
ous example of the influence of applied science is furnished by tho
way the use of electricity has been introduced into our daily life, and

  28                        Mr. Alexander    Siemens                [Feb. 3,
  several causes have contributed to facilitate the scientific treatment
  of electrical problems. Not the least among these is the circumstance
  that at first electricity could not be produced at a cheap rate for
  general commercial uses.      Thus it came about that telegraphy, for
  which weak currents are sufficient, was for a long time the only
  practical application, and during this period of comparative quiet a
  number of the most eminent scientific philosophers devoted their time
  to discover the characteristic features of this great power in nature,
  and the laws which it obeys. The consequence has been that at the
  time when the discovery of the dynamo-electric principle made cheap
  electricity a possible commodity, the laws on which electric currents
  act were thoroughly understood, and the development of the intro
  duction of electrical appliances could take place on the firm basis of
  scientific knowledge.
       The obligations that electrical engineers owe to science they have
  acknowledged in a practical manner in naming the units by which
  electricity is measured after the learned men who created the science
   of electricity.
       The circumstance that it is possible to reproduce perfectly the
   exact conditions for which electrical apparatus have been designed,
   has much facilitated the direct application of laboratory experiments
  to practical problems.      It is, for instance, quite feasible to take a
   small quantity of ore, to subject it in a laboratory to chemical and
  electrical treatment, and to judge from the results whether it will be
   possible to design works for the treatment of such ores in large
   quantities on the same lines.     As far as electricity is concerned it is
   possible in such cases to predict with absolute accuracy how much
   energy is wanted in each case to deposit a given quantity of metal in
   a given time.    The electrical engineer is thus enabled to arrive, in a
   comparatively easy and inexpensive manner, at reliable data, which in
   other branches of applied science have to be obtained by costly ex
   periments on a large scale.
        One of the most striking instances of the direct application of
   scientific researches to practical purposes has been furnished by Dr.
    John Hopkinson, who explained in his lecture before the Institution
   of Civil Engineers in the year 1883, how he had been led by mathe
   matical considerations to infer that alternate-current machines could
   be run in parallel, and what conditions were necessary to secure
    success.   His conclusions were tried shortly afterwards at the South
    Foreland Lighthouse, and have proved since to be of the utmost
    value for central electric lighting stations on the alternate-current
    system.     For the sake of historical accuracy       I  should mention,
    perhaps, that Dr. John Hopkinson called attention in the following
    year to a communication to the Boyal Society by Mr. Wilde, who
    had previously demonstrated the possibility of working alternators in
    parallel; yet the facts just related are an apt illustration of the
           I
   point desired to lay before you.
        While science is a safe guide for the engineer, and will warn him

of the mistakes and fallacies which ought to be avoided, there are
sometimes other considerations which will modify to an important
                                                   8
degree conclusions    based on scientific   principles alone. As an
 example, the case of heating by electricity may be cited. The scien-

SO                           Mr. Alexander      Siemens                    [Feb. 3,
fific data in connection with this problem are as follows: A kilo
gram of coal burnt to best advantage will give 8080 calories.     The
same amount of coal consumed in a boiler will produce steam sufficient
for 1 H.P. for 1 hour, and this horse-power can generate electricity
 at the rate of 660 watts, or about 570 calories, per hour.
      Assuming that in heating by burning coal, only a quarter of the
 theoretical effect is attained, and taking the price of coal at 20s. per
 ton, while the cost of a Board of Trade unit of electricity is 8d., it
 would appear that a farthings worth of coal will produce as much heat
 as 22d. worth of electricity.
      These figures apply to the conditions of life in London, where
fuel is abundant and power comparatively expensive ; elsewhere, in
Norway for instance, fuel may be expensive, and power, in the shape
of waterfalls, cheap.     Under such altered conditions electricity may
with advantage be employed for heating purposes, by producing it
with the aid of water-power, and utilising the heat generated by                it,
 in special appliances.

                                                                  is
horseshoe nails, for which special machines have been constructed,
into which      aheated rod of iron has to be fed. For this purpose the

to   a  commutator on the table, by which the current can either be
sent to the transformer of the heating apparatus, or to another one,

by radiation, the carbon        placed in

     The ingenious way in which Mr. Crompton has utilised the
 heating effect of electric currents for cooking purposes has no doubt
 been admired by most of you at the Crystal Palace Exhibition last
 year ; and when we remember that these cooking utensils consume
 fuel only during the time they are actually in use, and that they can
 be put in and out of action at a moment's notice, we cannot doubt
                                 Diagram    3.
                                Rivet-heating.
that these and many other obvious advantages will facilitate their
introduction in spite of the figures, as to cost, given by the scientific
data.
     Of late the transmission of power by electricity has occupied a
very prominent place in the public interest, and the project of
utilising the force of the Niagara Falls at distant towns is as closely
discussed as the plan of constructing long railways on which trains
are to run at fabulous speeds.
     As you will hear a discourse on electric railways in three weeks
from to-day,    I will not take up your time with this branch of the
subject,  but  will rather draw your attention to the distribution of
power by electricity from a central generating station.            Before
entering further into this, let me remind you that the earliest
magneto-electric machines were used nearly sixty years ago for the
production of power.     I  will mention only Jacobi's electric launch of
1835 as an example ; it must, therefore, be considered altogether
erroneous to ascribe the invention of the transmission of power to an
accident at the Vienna Exhibition in 1873, when, it is said, an
attendant placed some stray wires into the terminals of a dynamo-
machine ; it began to turn, and the transmission of power was first
demonstrated.
     As a matter of fact, Sir William Siemens once informed me that
his brother Werner was led to the discovery of the dynamo-electric

1893.]              on Theory and Practice in Electrical Science.                    33
principle  by the consideration that an electro-magnetic machine
behaved like a magneto-electric machine, when a current of electricity
was sent into     viz. both turn round and give out power. It was,
                     it,
of course, well known that      magneto-electric machine produces
                                        a                                            a
current of electricity when turned by mechanical power, and Werner
concluded that an electro-magnetic machine would behave in the
same manner.     We all know that he was right, but 'relate this   I
circumstance only as a further proof that the generation of power by
electric currents had been     well-known fact long previous to the
                                       a
Vienna Exhibition.
   Another well-known instance of transmission             of powor to               a
distance      furnished
               is         by the magneto-electrio          ABO     telegraph
instruments, where the motion at the sending end supplies the
currents necessary to move the indicator at the receiving station.
     As an illustration of the distribution of power by electricity      willI
briefly describe some radical alterations that have been made at the
works of Messrs. Siemens Brothers and Co. by the introduction of
electric motors in the place of steam engines.        The diagram on the
 wall shows in outline the various buildings in which work of different
 kinds     carried on with the help of different machines.
          is                                                         Electric
 motors are supplying the power, sometimes by driving shafting to
 which    agroup of tools      connected by belting, and sometimes by
                                   is
 being coupled direct to the moving mechanism.         Each section of the
 works has its own meter measuring the energy that          used there, and
                                                            a is
 all of them are connected by underground cables to central station,
 where three sets of engines and dynamos generate the electric current
for all purposes.
     There are two Willans and one Belliss steam engines, each of
 300 I.H.P., coupled direct to the dynamos and running at               speeda
 of 350 revolutions per minute.
     Room      left for fourth set but, including some auxiliary pumps
               is            a              ;
 and the switchboards for controlling the dynamos and for distributing
 the current, the whole space occupied by 1200 horse-power measures
only 32 by 42 feet.
     Close by are the condensers and three high-pressure boilers,
 which have replaced some low-pressure ones formerly used for some
 steam engines driving the machinery in the nearest building.
     The advantages that have been secured by the introduction of
 electric motors may be briefly stated under the following heads —               :
     1. Various valuable spaces formerly occupied by steam engines
 and boilers have been made available for the extension of workshops,
 and these are indicated on the diagram by shading.
     2.  By abolishing to     great extent the mechanical transmission
                                  a
 of power a considerable saving         effected in motive power, which
                                                is
is  especially noticeable at times when part only of the machinery                   is
 in use.
     3. As the electric motors take only as much current as          actually
                                                                        is
 required for the work they are doing,       further saving

                                                                   is

     4. The big steam engines, being compound and condensing, pro
duce a horse-power with a smaller consumption of fuel than the small
high-pressure steam engines scattered throughout the works.
      5. The numerous attendants of the old steam engines and boilers
have mostly been transferred to other work ; only a few of them are
required at the central station, and one or two men can easily look
after all the electric motors used in the various parts of the works.
     Elsewhere, equally favourable results have been obtained by the
introduction of electrical distribution of power, and in this respect     I
beg to refer you to a paper read before the German Institution of
Civil Engineers by Mr. E. Hartmann in April of last year, and to a
          read by Mr. Castermans before the Society of Engineers in
£iper
   iege  in  August last, in which he compares in detail various methods
of transmission of power, of which the electrical one was adopted for
a new small arms factory.
     We may, therefore, take it for granted that the advantages
alluded to above have not resulted from local circumstances at Wool
wich, but that they can be realised anywhere by the adoption of the
electric current for distributing power from a central station.          At
first sight this result appears to be of interest only to the manu
facturer, but the development of this idea may lead to far-reaching
consequences when we consider that cheap power is one of the most
important requisites for cheap production.            You can see on the
diagram     that the various buildings  are  separated by roads, and we can
easily imagine     that in each of them   an  independent owner carries on
work, so that the diagram represents part of a manufacturing town.
     While power was generated by steam engines, the cost of pro
ducing one horse-power varied a good deal in the different parts, and
the various owners could not have obtained their power on equal
terms, those possessing the largest steam engines having a distinct
advantage. This inequality is done away with altogether when the
power is distributed by electricity, as the current can be supplied for
large or small powers at the same rate per Board of Trade unit.          It
is therefore clear that the establishment of central stations for the
generation of electricity on a large scale will bring about the possi
bility of small works competing with large works in quite a number
of trades, where cheap power is of the first consideration.
     Another circumstance favouring small works is the diminution of
capit il outlay brought about by the employment of electric motors.
Not only are the motors cheaper than boilers and steam-engines of
corresponding power would be, but the outlay for belting and shafts
is saved, and the structure of the building need not be as substantial
as is necessary where belts and shafting have to be supported by it.
     A commencement has already been made in this direction by the
starting of electric light stations, where the owners do all in their
power to encourage the use of the current in motors in order to keep
the machinery at their central station more uniformly at work.
     The introduction of electricity as motive power will apparently
                                                                 d 2

86                         Mr. Alexander   Siemens                [Feb. 3,
present a strong contrast to the effect steam has had on the develop
ment of industries for the reasons already stated ; and, in addition,
there are many cases where the erection of boilers and steam engines,
or even of gas engines, would be inadmissible on account of want of
space or of the nuisances that are inseparable from them.          Motive
power will, therefore, be available in a number of instances where up
to the present time no mechanical power could be used, but the work
had to be done by manual labour or not at all.
      You may have noticed that    I  have confined my remarks hitherto
to the case of distributing electricity over a limited area, but that    I
have not yet discussed the question of transmitting power to a great
distance.
      Theoretically we have been told over and over again that the
motive power of the future will be supplied by waterfalls, and that
their power can be made available over large areas by means of
electric currents.     As a prominent example, the installation is con
stantly mentioned by which the power of a turbine at Lauffen was
transmitted over a distance of 110 statute miles to the Frankfurt
Exhibition with an efficiency of 75 per cent. No doubt this result is
very gratifying from a purely scientific point of view, but, unfortu
nately, in practical life only commercially successful applications of
science will have a lasting influence, and in this respect the Lauffen
 installation left much to be desired.
      On the one hand science tells us that the section of the conductor
can be diminished as the pressure of electricity is increased, and it
 appears to be only necessary to construct apparatus for generating
 electricity at a sufficiently high pressure so as to reduce the cost of a
long conductor to reasonable limits. On the other hand, experience
shows that at these high potentials the insulation of the electric
 current becomes a most difficult problem, and for practical purposes
 difficulty means an increased outlay of money. As an illustration of
the difficulties encountered in the employment of high-tension currents,
 I can demonstrate to you that many of the insulating materials em
ployed with success for low-pressure currents break down under the
 strain of high-pressure electricity.
      For the purpose of these experiments the current of electricity
delivered by the street main at a pressure of 2400 volts is diverted
 to a large transformer placed on the ground-floor, and from there it is
 led through a twin cable to this room at a pressure which can be in
 creased up to 50,000 volts.     This twin cable was used in 1891 at the
 Frankfurt Exhibition, for conveying a current of 20,000 volts from
 the main Exhibition to the Exhibition on the Main, and when it was
 returned to the works, it was found that the insulation was as good as
 when it was first manufactured.       A sample of it lies on the table,
  and by its side the sample of a concentric cable designed for a current
 of 2500 volts. A comparison of the two shows in a striking manner
 how elaborately high-tension cables have to be insulated.

1893.]         on Theory and Practice in Electrical Science.              37
    By the first experiment        I will try to show you how the space
surrounding a conductor        connected  to a source of high-pressure elec-
                              3*
 tricity is, so to speak, filled with electric stresses, that become visible
 when a vacuum tube is brought near the conductor.          This experiment

88                        Mr. Alexander  Siemens                 [Feb. 3,
was shown here by Nikola Tesla in connection with his lecture on
alternate currents of high frequency ; but     I want to show you that
high tension and low frequency produce the same effect.
     The next experiment was suggested by Dr. Obach, and the appa
ratus employed in it is shown in Diagram 5. A copper conductor
(thickly insulated with indiarubber) is placed in a brass tube, and tho
annular space between them is filled with coloured water which com
municates with a vertical glass tube inserted in the centre of the
horizontal brass tube. One conductor from the high-tension trans
former is connected to the insulated copper conductor, and the other
to the brass tube. Under these conditions no current passes, but the
electric stress heats the insulating material, which shows itself by the
rise of the coloured liquid in the glass tube.
     Werner Siemens called attention to this phenomenon in a paper
 contributed to Poggendorf 's Annalen in 1857, in which he commu
 nicated a series of experiments on electrostatic induction, proving, as
 he expressly stated, the correctness of Faraday's theory of molecular
induction.
     Not very long ago Signor Riccnrdo Arno showed that a cylinder
 of insulating material, brought under the influence of a rotary field
 and suitably suspended, would commence to revolve, thus showing
 that molecular movement was set up in it. He produced this effect
 by means of an apparatus, a copy of which you see before you. A
 hollow cylinder of gutta-percha is suspended on the point of a needle,
 so that it can be made to turn with very little friction.     Around it
 are placed four vertical metal strips to which the high-tension current
 is brought, as shown in Diagram 6. Between the two terminals of
 the high-tension circuit, a connection is made by an inductionless
 resistance in the shape of a LKube filled with water and a condenser.
 Two of the metal strips opposite each other are joined to the ends of
 the inductionless resistance and the other two strips are connected to
 tho condanser. In this way there is a difference of a quarter of a
 phase between the two currents, and a rotating field is produced,
 which causes the cylinder to revolve on account of the electrical
 hysteresis set up.      When the current is reversed the cylinder
 revolves in the opposite direction.     This result also obtains in the
 case of a glass beaker which is inverted and supported by a pin
 point.
      Wood, slate, and marble are usually reckoned to be insulating
 materials, but you will see that they do not offer a protracted resis
 tance to a current of high potential. When the electric spark passes
 through marble it converts the carbonate of lime into quicklime, as
 can readily be shown by moistening the broken surface with phenol-
 phthalein, which leaves the carbonate of lime white and colours the
 quicklime a beautiful pink colour. Even glass is pierced ; and we
  must confess that at present we have no very reliable means of dealing
  with electricity of very high pressure.

    Enough   has been shown, however, to prove that by utilising
electricity we  can extend the employment of natural forces for
procuring the necessaries of life ; and our experience shows that

        Turacin, a remarkable Animal Pigment containing Copper.
The study of natural colouring matters              is at once peculiarly
fascinating and peculiarly difficult.        The nature of the colouring
matters in animals and plants, and even in some minerals (ruby,
sapphire, emerald and amethyst, for example) is still, in the majority
of cases, not completely fathomed.
     Animal pigments are generally less easily extracted and are more
complex than those of plants.           They appear invariably to contain
nitrogen — an observation in accord with the comparative richness in
that element of animal cells and their contents.        Then, too, much of
the coloration of animals, being due to microscopic structure, and
therefore having a mechanical and not a pigmentary origin, differs
essentially from the coloration of plants.           Those animal colours
which are primarily due to structure do, however, involve the
presence of a dark pigment — brown or black — which acts at once as a
foil and as an absorbent of those incident rays which are not reflected.
      Many spectroscopic examinations of animal pigments have been
made.      Except in the case of blood- and bile-pigments, very few have
been submitted to exhaustive chemical study.             Spectral analysis,
when uncontrolled by chemical, and when the influence of the solvent
employed is not taken into account, is very likely to mislead the
investigator.     And, unfortunately, the non-crystalline character of
many animal pigments, and the difficulty of purifying them by
means of the formation of salts and of separations by the use of
appropriate solvents, oppose serious obstacles to elucidation.          Of
blood-red or hemoglobin           it cannot be said that we know the
centesimal composition, much less the molecular weight.            Even of
hiematin the empirical formula has not yet been firmly estab
lished.     The group of black and brown pigments to which the
various     melanins    belong still awaits adequate investigation.    We
know they     contain   nitrogen (8£ to 13 per cent.), and sometimes iron,
but the analytical results do not warrant the suggestion of empirical
formulae for them.          The more nearly they appear to approach
purity    the  freer   the   majority of them seem from any fixed con
 stituent   such  as  iron   or other metal.    It is to be regretted that
Dr. Krukenberg,      to  whom    we  are indebted  for much valuable work

 1893.]         cm Turaein, a remarkable Animal Pigment.                  45
on several pigments extracted from feathers, has not submitted the in
teresting substances he has described to quantitative chemical analysis.
     I  must not, however, dwell farther upon these preliminary mat
 ters.   I have introduced them mainly in order to indicate how little
precise information has yet been gathered as to the constitution of the
greater number of animal pigments, and how difficult is their study.
     And now let me draw your attention to a pigment which             I had
 the good fortune to discover, and to the investigation of which     I  have
 devoted   I  am afraid to say how many years.
     It was so long ago as the year 1866 that the solubility in water of
 the red colouring matter in the wing-feathers of a plantain-eater was
pointed out to me.       [One of these feathers, freed from grease, was
shown to yield its pigment to pure water.]       I soon found that alkaline
 liquids were more effective solvents than pure water, and that- the
 pigment could be precipitated from its solution by the addition of an
acid.    [The pigment was extracted from a feather by very dilute
ammonia, and then precipitated by adding excess of hydrochloric
acid.] The next step was to filter off the separated colouring matter,
and to wash and dry it. The processes of washing and drying are
tedious and cannot be shown in a lecture.         But the product obtained
 was a solid of a dark crimson hue, non-crystalline, and having a
 purple semi-metallic lustre.     I named it turaein (in a paper published
                                          ' The
 in a now long-defunct       periodical          Student and Intellectual
 Observer,' of April, 1868).     The name was taken from " Touraco,"
the appellation by which the plantain-eaters are known — the most
 extensive genus of this family of birds being Turacus.
     From the striking resemblance between the colour of arterial
blood and that of the red touraco feathers,          I  was led to compare
their spectra. Two similar absorption bands were present in both
cases, but their positions and intensities differed somewhat. Naturally
I  sought for iron in my new pigment.         I burnt a portion, dissolved
the ash in hydrochloric acid, and then added sodium acetate and
potassium ferrocyanide.       To my astonishment       I got a precipitate,
not of Prussian blue, but of Prussian brown.         This indication of the
presence of copper in turacin was confirmed by many tests, the metal
itself being also obtained by electrolysis.       It was obvious that the
proportion of copper present in the pigment was very considerable —
greatly in excess of that of the iron (less than • 5 per cent.) in the pig
ment of blood.
     Thus far two striking peculiarities of the pigment had been
revealed, namely, its easy removal from the web of the feather, and
the presence in it of a notable quantity of copper.             Both facts
remain unique in the history of animal pigments.             The solubility
was readily admitted on all hands, not so the presence of copper. It
was suggested that it was derived from the Bunsen burner used
in the incineration, or from some preservative solution applied to the
bird-skins. And it was asked " How did the copper get into the
            "
feathers ?      The doubters might have satisfied themselves as to

16                       Professor A.  H. Church                 [Feb. 17,
copper being normally and invariably present by applying a few easy
tests and by the expenditure of half-a-crown in acquiring a touraco
wing.    My results were, however, confirmed (in 1872) by several
independent observers, including Mr. W. Crookes, Dr. Gladstone,
and Mr. Greville Williams.      And in 1873 Mr. Henry Bassett, at the
request of the late Mr. J. J. Monteiro, pushed the inquiry somewhat
further.    I  quote from Monteiro's
                                        '
                                          Angola and the River Congo,'
published in 1875 (vol. ii. pp. 75-77).       I
                                            " purchased a large bunch
of the red wing-feathers in the market at Sierra Leone, with which
Mr. H. Bassett has verified Professor Church's results conclusively,"
&c, &c. Mr. Bassett's results were published in the Chemical News
in 1873, three years after the appearance of my research in the Phil.
Trans. As concentrated hydrochloric acid removes no copper from
turacin, even on boiling, the metal present could not have been a
mere casual impurity ; as the proportion is constant in the turacin
obtained from different species of touraco, the existence of a single
definite compound is indicated.     The presence of traces of copper in
a very large number of plants as well as of animals has been incon-
testably established.    And, as  I pointed out in 1868, copper can be
readily detected in the ash of banana fruits, the favourite food of
several species of the " turacin-bearers."      The feathers of a single
bird contain on the average two grains of turacin, corresponding to ¦14
of a grain of metallic copper ; or, putting the amount of pigment
present at its highest, just one-fifth of a grain.    This is not a large
amount to be furnished by its food to one of these birds once annually
during the season of renewal of its feathers.      I am bound, however,
to say that in the blood and tissues of one of these birds, which        I
analysed immediately after death,    I  could not detect more than faint
traces of copper.      The particular specimen examined was in full
plumage;     I  conclude that the copper in its food, not being then
wanted, was not assimilated.
     Let us now look a little more closely at these curious birds them-
selvos. Their nearest allies are the cuckoos, with which they were
formerly united by systematists. It has, however, been long con
ceded that they constitute a family of equal rank with the Cuculidas.
According to the classification adopted in the Natural History
Museum, the order Picariae contains eight sub-orders, the last of
which, the Coccyges, consists of two families, the CuculidaB and the
MusophagideB. To the same order belong the Hoopoes, the Trogons,
the Wood-peckers.         The plantain-eaters or Musophagidue are
arranged in six genera and comprise 25 species. In three genera —
Turacus, Gallirex, and Musophaga —comprising eighteen species, and
following one another in z >ological soquence, turacin occurs ; from
three genera (seven species) — Corythaeola, Schizorhis, and Gymno-
 schizorhis — the pigment is absent. [The coloured illustrations to
 H. Schlegel's Monograph (Amsterdam, 1860) on the Musophagidra
 were exhibited].     The family is confined to Africa : 8 of the turacin-
 bearers are found in the west sub-region, 1 in the south-west, 2 in

1893.]            on Turacin, a remarkable   Animal Pigment.             47
the south, 2 in the south-east, 4 in the east, 2 in the central, and 2 in
the north-east. It is noteworthy that, in all these sub-regions save the
south-east, turacin-bearers are found along with those plantain-eaters
which do not contain the pigment. Oddly enough two of the latter
species, Schizorhis africana and S. zonura, possess white patches
destitute of pigment in those parts of the feathers which in the
turacin-bearers      are crimson.    These birds do not,  I  will not say
cannot, decorate theso bare patches with this curiously complex
pigment.       [Some extracts were here given from the late Mr.
Monteiro's book on Angola, vol. ii. pp. 74-79, and from letters by
Dr. B. Hinde. These extracts contained references to curious traits
of the touracos.]
     Usually from 12 to 18 of the primaries or metacarpo-digitals
and secondaries or cubitals amongst the wing feathers of the turacin-
bearers have the crimson patches in their web.           Occasionally the
 crimson patches are limited to six or seven of the eleven primaries.
I   have observed this particularly with the violet plantain-eater
 (Mutophaga violacea).         In these cases the crimson head-feathers,
 which also owe their colour to turacin, are few in number, as if the
 bird, otherwise healthy, had been unable to manufacture a sufficiency
 of the pigment.         I  may here add that the red tips of the crest
 feathers of Turacus meriani also contain turacin.
     In all the birds in which turacin occurs, this pigment is strictly
 confined to the red parts of the web, and is there unaccompanied by
 any other colouring matter. It is therefore found that if a single
 barb from a feather bo analysed its black base and its black termina
 tion possess no copper, while the intermediate portion gives the blue-
 green flash of copper when incinerated in the Bunsen flame.            [A
 parti-coloured     feather was burnt in the Bunsen flame, with the
 result indicated.]
     Where it occurs, turacin is homogeneously distributed in the
 barbs, bar bi cels and crochets of the web, and is not found in granules
or corpuscles.
     To the natural question " Does turacin occur in any other birds
 besides the touracos?" a negative answer must at present be given.
 At least my search for this pigment in scores of birds more or less
 nearly related to the Musophagidn has met with no success.             In
 some of the plantain-eaters (species of Turacus and Gallirex) there
 is, however, a second pigment closely related to turacin.        It is of
 a dull grass-green colour, and was named Turacoverdin by Dr.
 Krukenberg in 1881.            I had obtained this pigment in 1868 by
 boiling turacin with a solution of caustic soda, and had figured its
 characteristic    absorption     band in my first paper (Phil. Trims.,
 voL clix. 1870, p. 630, fig. 4).        My product was, however, mixed
with unaltered turacin.            But Dr. Krukenberg obtained what
certainly seems to be the same pigment from the green feathers of
 Turacus corylhaix, by treating them with a 2 per cent, solution of
caustic soda.        I  find, however, that a solution of this strength

48                            Professor A.    H. Church                 [Feb. 17,
dissolves, even in the cold, not only a brown pigment associated with
turacoverdin, but ultimately the whole substance of the web.                  By
using a much weaker solution of alkali (1 part to a thousand of
water) a far better result is obtained.          [The characteristic absorption
band of turacoverdin, which lies on the less refrangible side of D,
was shown ; also the absorption bands of various preparations of
turacin.]       I   have    refrained from the further investigation           of
turacoverdin, hoping that Dr. Krukenberg would complete his
study of it. At present           I can only express my opinion that it is
identical    with    the  green pigment into which turacin when moist is
converted by long exposure to the air or by ebullition with soda, and
which seems to be present in traces in all preparations of isolated
turacin however carefully prepared.
     A few observations may now be introduced on the physical and
chemical characters of turacin.          It is a colloid of colloids. And it
enjoys   in  a  high degree    one  of the  peculiar properties of colloids, that
of retaining, when freshly precipitated, an immense proportion of
water. Consequently, when its solution in ammonia is precipitated
by an acid, the coagulum formed is very voluminous.                [The experi
ment was shown.]           One gram of turacin is capable of forming a
semi-solid mass with 600 grams of water. Another character which
turacin shares with many other colloids is its solubility in pure
water and its insolubility in the presence of mere traces of saline
matter. It would be tedious to enumerate all the observed properties
of turacin, but its deportment on being heated and the action of
sulphuric acid upon it demand particular attention.
     At 100° C., and at considerably higher temperatures, turacin
suffers no change.        When, however, it is heated to the boiling-point
of mercury it is wholly altered. No vapours are evolved, but the
substance becomes black and is no longer soluble in alkaline liquids,
nor, when still more strongly heated afterwards, can it be made to
yield the purple vapours which unchanged turacin gives off under the
same     circumstances.         This peculiarity of turacin caused great
difficulty    in   its   analysis, for these purple vapours contain an
organic crystalline compound in which both nitrogen and copper are
present, and which resist further decomposition by heat.                [Turacin
was so heated as to show its purple vapours, and also the green flame
with which they burn.] This production of a volatile organic com
pound of copper is perhaps comparable with the formation of nick el
and ferro-carbonyl.
     The action of concentrated sulphuric acid upon turacin presents
some remarkable features.           The pigment dissolves with a fine crimson
colour, and yields a new compound, the spectrum of which presents a
very close resemblance to that of hamatoporphyrin                 [Turacin was
dissolved in oil of vitriol : the spectrum of an ammoniacal solution of
the turacoporphyrin          thus produced was also shown], the product
obtained by the same treatment from haematin : in other respects also this
new derivative of turacin, which          I  call turacoporphyrin, reminds one

 1893.]          on Turacin, a remarkable      Animal Pigment.              49
 of hnmatoporphyrin.        But, unlike this derivative of hfematin, it seems
 to retain some   of its metallic constituent.     The analogy between the
 two bodies cannot be very close, for if they were so nearly related as
 might be argued from the spectral observations, hfematin ought to
contain not more but less metal than is found to be present therein.
     The percentage composition of turacin is probably — Carbon 53 • 69,
              ¦             •                ¦                   ¦
hydrogen 4 6, copper 7 01, nitrogen 6 96, and oxygen 27 74.             These
numbers correspond pretty nearly to the empirical formula, C82 H81
Cuj X, 032.            I
                But lay no stress upon this expression.
     I have before said that copper is very widely distributed in the
Animal Kingdom.          Dr. Giunti, of Naples, largely extended (1881) our
knowledge on this point.        I  can hardly doubt that this metal will be
found in traces in all animals.      But besides turacin only one organic
copper compound has been as yet recognised in animals.               This is a
respiratory, and not a mere decorative, pigment like turacin.            Leon
Fredericq discovered this substance, called haemocyanin.          It has been
observed in several genera of Crustacea, Arachnida, Gastropoda and
Cephalopoda.       I  do not think it has ever been obtained in a state of
purity, and   I cannot accept for it the fantastic formula — C867 H1369 On
84 025g
         — which has recently been assigned to it. On the other hand,
I do not sympathise with the doubts as to its nature which F. Heim
has recently formulated in the Comptes Rendu*.
     It is noteworthy, in connection with the periodic law, that all the
essential elements of animal and vegetable organic compounds have
rather low atomic weights, iron, manganese and copper representing
the superior limit.       Perhaps natural organic compounds containing
manganese will some day be isolated, but at present such bodies are
limited to a few containing iron, and to two, hteinocyanin and turacin,
of which copper forms an essential part.
     If I have not yet unravelled the whole mystery of the occurrence
and properties of this strange pigment, it must be remembered that it
is very rare and costly, and withal difficult to prepare in a state of
assured purity.      It belongs, moreover, to a class of bodies which my
late master, Dr. A. W. von Hofmann, quaintly designated as " dirts"
(a magnificent dirt truly !)— substances which refuse to crystallize
and cannot be distilled.         I  have experienced likewise, during the
course of this investigation, frequent reminders of another definition
propounded by the same great chemist, when he described organic
research as " a more or less circuitous route to the sink 1
                                                                "
     I am very glad to have had the opportunity of sharing with an
audience in this Institution the few glimpses       I  have caught from time
to time during the progress of a tedious and still incomplete research
into the nature of a pigment which presents physiological and chemical
problems of high if not of unique interest.
     Let my last word be a word of thanks.        I   am indebted to several
friends for aid in this investigation, and particularly to Dr. MacMunn,
of Wolverhampton, the recognised expert in the spectroscopy of animal
pigments.                                                       [A. H. C]

                            Electrical Railways.
One of the most striking of the many new departures in the practical
application of electrical science, which made the Paris Exhibition of
1881 memorable, was a short tramway laid down under the direction
of the late Sir William Siemens, from the Palais de l'lndustrie to the
Place de la Concorde, upon which a tramcar worked by an electric
motor plied up and down with great regularity and success during
the period of the Exhibition.       Yet few of those who saw in this
experiment the possibilities of a great future for a new mode of
traction would have ventured to predict that within ten years' time,
in the United States alone, over 5000 electric cars would be in opera
tion, travelling 50,000,000 miles annually, and carrying 250,000,000
passengers, or that electrical traction would have solved the problem
of better communication in London and other large cities. Two
years before the Exhibition in Paris the late Dr. Werner Siemens had
exhibited at the Berlin Exhibition in 1879 an experimental electric
tramway on a much smaller scale, and his firm had put down in 1881
the first permanent electric railway in the short length of line at
Lichterfelde, near Berlin, which,    I  believe, is still at work.    In the
same year Dr. William Siemens undertook to work the tramway, then
projected, between Portrush and Bushmills, in the North of Ireland,
over six miles in length, by electric power, making use of the water-
power of the Bush River for the purpose, an undertaking which              I
had the advantage of carrying out under his direction.         It is no part
of my object to-night to follow further the history of electric
traction, which is so recent that it is familiar to all ; but, in alluding
to these initial stages of its development, I have desired to recall
that it was the foresight and energy of Dr. Werner and Dr. William
Siemens, and their skill in applying scientific knowledge to the uses
of daily life, which gave the first impulse to the development of the
new electrical power.
    The problem of electric traction may be naturally considered
under three heads : —
    (1) The production of the electrical power.
    ( 2 ) Its distribution along the line.
    (3) The reconversion of electrical into mechanical power, in the
car motor or locomotive.

1893.]                  on   Electrical Bailwayt.                        51
      The first of these, here in England at any rate, is dependent upon
the    economical production      of steam power, although there are
essential points of difference between the conditions under which
steam-power is required for electric traction           purposes and for
electric lighting.        But in Scotland and Ireland, and in many
countries abroad, there is abundant water power, now only very
partially utilised.     The Portrush line is worked in part by water and
in part by steam-power, but for the Bessbrook and Newry Tramway
(of which there is a working model on the table) water-power is
exclusively used.
     A few experiments will show that the demand for power on the
generating plant is greatest at the moment of starting the car or
train, when, in addition to the power required to overcome the
frictional resistances, power is also required to accelerate the velocity.
Thus, if instead of a single car there are a number of trains moving
on the one system, and it so happens that several are starting
together, the demand made upon the generating plant may at one
moment be three or four times as great as that made a few seconds
after.    This is shown in the diagrams which exhibit the variation of
current supplied by the generators on the City and South London
 Railway, with eight trains running together, the readings being taken
every ten seconds.       The maxima rise as high as double the mean ;
thus the generating plant must be capable of instantly responding to
 a demand double or even treble the average demand upon it
     In electric lighting it is true there is not less variation between
 the maximum demand and the mean taken during the ordinary hours
 of lighting, but it is only in the event of sudden fog that the
 probable demand cannot be accurately gauged beforehand, and
 provided for by throwing more generators into action.          Thus in a
 lighting station    each  generator may   be kept working approximately
 at its full load, and therefore under conditions of maximum economy,
 whereas in a traction station the whole plant must be kept ready to
 instantaneously respond to the maximum demands which may be
 mado upon    it,and must therefore necessarily work with    a    low load
 factor, and consequently with diminished economy.        So important   is
 the influence on cost of production of the possible demand in relation
 to average demand, that the Corporation of Manchester, under their
 order for electric supply, have decided, upon the advice of their
 engineer, to annually charge  a    customer 31. per quarter for each unit
 per hour of maximum supply which he may require, in addition to 2d.
 for each unit actually consumed,   i.   e. for being ready to supply him
 with    a certain amount of electrical power       ifrequired to do so,
 they charge an additional sum equivalent to the charge for its actual
 consumption for 1440 hours.
      In one respect water-power has an economic advantage over steam-
 power, because although steam engine and turbine alike work with
 greatly reduced efficiency at reduced loads, when the turbine gate*
 •re partially closed and the water restrained in the reservoir   2 it not

subject to loss of potential energy, whereas the energy of the steam
held back by valves of the engine suffers loss through radiation and
 condensation.
     At Bessbrook the turbine and generator dynamo combined yield
 60 per cent. of the energy of the water as electrical energy available
for work on the line, but when the load is reduced to a third of the
full load the efficiency is reduced to 33 per cent. So on the City and
South London line, a generator engine and dynamo will yield, when
working at their full load, 78 per cent. of the indicated horse-power
as useful electrical power, but at half load the efficiency falls to
65 per cent.    Notwithstanding these conditions the generator station
of the City and South London line is producing electrical energy at
a cost of l-56d. per Board of Trade unit, which is less than the
annual average cost of production of any electric station in England,
with the single exception of Bradford, which has the advantage both
of cheap coal and cheap labour. In output it is the largest of any
Electric Generating Station in England, the total electrical energy
delivered in 1892 being 1,250,000 Board of Trade units, the
second on the list being the St. James and Fall Mall with 1,186,826
units.
    Let us pass now to the consideration of the distribution of the
electric power along the line.       I have equipped the three model
tracks before you with three different kinds of conductors.       In two
of them the rails of the permanent way, which are necessarily
uninsulated, are made use of for the return current.    This plan, with
I  believe the almost single exception of the Buda-Pesth Tramway,
has been universally adopted with the object of saving the cost of a
return conductor ; but it is doubtful whether such an arrangement
can be considered final, for it must necessarily create differences of
potential in the earth, which already in some instances have had
disturbing effects upon our observatories, or upon our telegraph and
telephone systems. It appears to be probable in the more or less
distant future that the use of the earth for the passage of large
current will be prohibited by legislation ; and that it will be reserved
for the more delicate and widely extended operations of telegraphy
and telephony.      These disturbances may of course be easily avoided
by the use of an insulated conductor for the return circuit; and it
may be that our legislature, looking forward to a remoter future,
when electrical forces may be utilised, compared with which even
those involved in our present telegraphs and telephones are incon
siderable, will insist upon all, — tramways, telegraphs and telephones,
                                               I
—using an insulated return ; a course which venture to think would
be of present benefit to these services, as well as a safeguard for the
interests of the future.   In the case of conductors which are in such
a position that contact may be made from them to the ground through
the body of a horse or some other animal coming into contact with
them, there is another strong argument for an insulated return, as
many animals, and notably horses, are far more sensitive to electric

 shock than man. It is not perhaps well known, but still a fact, that
 a shock of 250 volts is quite sufficient to kill a horse almost instan
 taneously.
      The first model has a single overhead conductor with return by
 the rails ; but in place of a single fishing-rod collector or trolley to
 take the current from the overhead wire there are fixed on the car
 two rigid bars, one at each end, which slide along the under surface
 of the wire and make a rubbing contact against it. This system,
 devised by Dr. John Hopkinson, has the advantage that there is less
 difficulty in maintaining contact on uneven roads or on curves, and
 that the catenaries of the suspended wire may be hung with greater
 dip, and therefore with less tension.              Again, the double contact
 obviates the frequent breaks and consequent sparking of a single
 trolley system.      The second model shows the system adopted on the
 City and South London line, and more recently followed on the
 Liverpool Overhead line, of a conductor of channel steel, upon which
 collectors fixed to the locomotives make a sliding contact.                The
 third track shows an overhead system like the first, but with an
 insulated return in place of return by the rails.
      The characteristic feature of an electric motor is that it delivers
 ns the mechanical power we require directly in the form of a couple
 about an axis instead of in the form of a rectilinear force, as is the
 case with steam, gas, or air engines, which must be reduced to a
 rotary form by connecting rod and crank. Thus it is possible to
 sweep away all intermediate gear, and to arrive at once at the
 simplest of all forms of a traction motor, consisting of but one pair
of wheels fixed on a single axle with the armature constructed directly
 upon  it, with its magnets suspended from       it    and maintained in their
 position against     the  magnetic     forces   acting upon them by their
 weight.    Such a  locomotive    is  shown    in  the third model before you.
So far as    I am aware,    a    locomotive of such simplicity as this has
never been constructed for practical work, but on the City and South
London line the armatures of the motors are placed directly on the
axles, and the magnets suspended partly from the axles and partly
from the frame.
     The second model    is   an exact reproduction of the locomotives on
the City and South London line, but with         a     different arrangement of
motors.     Here both armatures are included in the same magnetic
circuit, and both magnets and armatures carried on the frame of the
locomotive and not on the axles.            The armatures are geared to the
axles by diagonal connecting rods, the axle boxes being inclined, so
that their rise and fall in the horn blocks       is     at right angles to the
connecting   rods.    This   design,  which is    due   to  the late Mr. Lange,
of Messrs. Beyer, Peacock         &    Co.,  allows    of  the  motor armature
being placed   on  the  floor  level  of  the locomotive,    and  so more easily
accessible.
     This model will serve to show some of the characteristic features,
as well as somo of the characteristic         defects, of an electric motor as

          But in order to show these clearly may refer for a moment
to the general theory of a motor.        It is easily shown that in a series
wound motor the couple or turning moment on the axle is a function
of the current only, and independent of the speed and electro-motive
force.    Again, it follows from Ohm's law that the current passing
through the motor multiplied by the resistance of the magnet and
armature coils is equal to the difference between the electro-motive
force at the terminals of the motor and the electro-motive force which
would be generated by the motor, if it were working at the same
speed as a generator of electricity, that is to say the difference between
the electro-motive force at the terminals and what is called the " back
                                                                            "
or " counter
               "
                   electro-motive force of the motor.          Hence if the
terminals of the motor be coupled direct to the line at the moment of
starting when the motor is still at rest, the current will be very great
and its power entirely absorbed in the coils of the armature and
magnets, but the turning moment will then be a maximum.                  The
motor then begins to move, part of the power being spent in over
coming frictional resistances and part in accelerating the train.          A
back electro-motive force is then set up, increasing as the speed
increases, and causing the current to diminish until finally a position
of equilibrium is established, when the speed is such that the back
electro-motive force together with the loss of potential in the coils of
the motor is equal to the potential of the line.          But in practice the
mechanical strength of the motor, and the carrying power of its coils,
as well as the limited current available from the generators, makes it
necessary to introduce resistances in circuit with the motor to throttle
the current and to reduce it within proper limits. It is to this point      I
desire to draw attention, that in traction work when starting the
motor resistances must be introduced, which, with the resistance
of the motor itself, at the moment of starting, absorb the whole
power of the current, reducing the efficiency of the motor to nil,
and which continue to absorb a large percentage of the power, until
the condition of equilibrium is established.              This is the great
defect  in electric  motors  for traction  work,  and  its importance can be
shown very clearly by reference to the work done on the City and
South London line.          There the motors when working with their
normal current have an efficiency of 90 per cent., but the actual all-
round efficiency of the locomotive as a whole is 70 per cent. only, so
that the loss in starting is equal to 20 per cent, of the whole power.
 Of course in some respects the City and South London line is
exceptional in that a start is made every two or three minutes.
Various devices have been suggested with a view to diminishing this
waste of power in starting an electric motor, but none entirely meet
the case.    Thus, if the locomotive or car has two motors, these can
be coupled in series at the start, and subsequently thrown into parallel,
thereby doubling the tractive force with a given current, or for the
same tractive force reducing the loss of power by three-fourths.
When through the increase of speed of the motor the back electro

  1893.]                   on Electrical Hallways.                      55
  motive force balances the electro-motive force of the line, the speed
  can be increased by diminishing the magnetic field by reducing the
  effective coils on the magnets, but this device does not give any
  assistance at the lower speeds, as the magnets ought to be so wound
  as to be high on the characteristic curve, or nearly saturated with
  the normal current, and it is therefore not possible to obtain any
  increased intensity of field by increasing the convolutions of the
  magnet coils.    If it were possible to use alternate current motors for
  traction work, the difficulty could at once be met by introducing a
  transformer in the circuit, and placing the motor in its secondary.
  The effective convolutions of the secondary circuit on the transformer
  could then be varied as the speed increases in such wise that the
  electro-motive force of the line is balanced by the back electro-motive
  force of the motor and the fall of potential due to the resistance of
  the motor coils, so avoiding all need for resistances.
      The City and South London line has enabled experiments to be
  made on the efficiency of the railway system as a whole, taking into
  account the loss of power in the generators, on the line, and in the
  motors, and in the resistances of the locomotives.         The loss in
  the line is about 11 per cent. of the electrical power generated, and
  the efficiency of the locomotives as a whole is, as      I  have shown,
  70 per cent. ; thus the electrical efficiency of the entire system
  is 62 per cent. The trains weigh with full load of 100 passengers
 about 40 tons, and the average speed between stations is 13*5
 miles per hour. The cost of working, including all charges, during
 last half year was 7' Id. per train mile, of which 4 • 7(7. represents
 the cost of production of the electric power, and 2 * hi. the cost of
 utilising it on the locomotives.      It is perhaps hardly a fair com
 parison to compare the cost of working such a line as the South
 London line with the cost of steam traction on other lines, inasmuch
 as steam could not possibly be used in the tunnels, only 10 feet
 6 inches diameter, in which this line is constructed, but the com
 parison is not uninstructive.     Take the Mersey Rail way, where the
 gradients and nature of the traffic are similar.        On the Mersey
 Rail way the locomotives weigh about 70 tons, and the train, which is
 capable of carrying about 350 passengers, 150 tons. According to
 the published returns of the company, the cost of locomotive power is
 14d. per train mile, i.e. double the cost on the South London line,
 but for a train weighing between four and five times as much, but
 capable of carrying only 3£ times the number of passengers ; thus
 the cost of steam traction per ton mile of train is about half that per
 ton mile of train for electric traction.      But it is not on the cost
 per ton mile that the success of a passenger line depends. The real
 basis of comparison is the cost per passenger mile, and here electric
traction has great advantage over steam, as the dead weight of the
electric motor is small compared with the dead weight of steam
locomotives of the same power, and with electric motors the trains
can be split up into smaller units, at but slightly increased cost, so

permitting a more frequent service.        We cannot expect, therefore
that electric traction with our present knowledge will take the place
of steam traction on our trunk lines ; but it has its proper function
in the working of the underground lines now projected for London,
Paris, Berlin, Brussels, and other large towns, and also      I  think on
other urban lines, for example, on the Liverpool Overhead Railway,
where trains of large carrying capacity are not required, but a
frequent service is essential ; and finally, also on those short
lines, whether independent or branches of the great trunk lines,
where water-power is available.             I
                                     When undertook the construction
of the Bessbrook line it was a condition that the cost of working
should be less than the cost of working by steam, a condition which
the first six months of working showed to be successfully fulfilled.
When Messrs. Mather and Piatt undertook the construction of the
electric plant for the City and South London Railway, they guaran
teed that the cost of traction for a service of 8247 miles per week as
actually run should not exceed 6 • 3d. per train mile, exclusive of the
drivers' wages.     Their anticipations have been more than realised,
the actual cost being 5* Id. per train mile only.             There are,
however, other projects, both in America and on the Continent, for
 electric railways on which the special feature is to be an enormously
 high speed of travel, speeds of 150 and even 200 miles per hour
 being promised.      With a steam locomotive, involving the recipro
 cating motion of the piston and connecting rod, such speeds are
 probably unattainable, but they may be realised in the purely rotary
 motion of an electric motor.    But at such high speeds as these the
 power required to overcome the air resistance is of special considera
 tion.    Probably up to speeds of 750 miles per hour, or even to
 higher limits still, the ordinary law of air resistance holds good, as
 the rate of disturbance is still less than the velocity of waves in air,
 but above these limits we leave the regions of ordinary locomotion
 and enter rather into the field of projectiles.     Assuming, however,
 that the ordinary laws of air resistance do hold good,   I  calculate that
 the power required to propel an ordinary train 200 feet long at
 200 miles per hour against the resistance of air alone, apart from the
 frictional resistances, would not be less than 1700 horse-power.
 Though there is nothing to prevent the construction of electric
 locomotives capable of developing this or even greater power, the
 strength of the materials at present at command will set a limit to
 the speeds which may be obtained.
      In order that the engineer may realise the imperfection of all his
  works, it is well for him to be constrained from time to time to con
  template the amount of energy involved in his final purpose compared
  with the energy of the coal with which he starts.         I have endea
  voured to put before you to-night the losses that occur and the reasons
  for them, in some steps of the complex machine which constitutes an
  electric railway ; so in conclusion  I will draw your attention to the
  ultimate efficiency of the machine, starting with the coal and ending

starting with the familiar 12,000,000 foot-pounds, the energy of a
pound of coal, shows the loss in each step, supposing it made with
the most economical appliances known to the engineer, first in the
boiler, then in the steam engine, generator dynamo, conductors, loco
motives, in the dead weight of the train, till finally we arrive at the
energy expended on the passenger himself, which we find to be
133,000 foot-pounds, or but little more than 1 per cent, of the energy
with which we started. It is true indeed that transportation is a
more economical process than lighting with incandescent lamps, in
which the final efficiency is about one-half per cent., but whether in
lighting or in traction, when   we consider that ninety-nine   parts are
now   wasted for one part saved, we may realise that the future      has
greater possibilities than anything accomplished in the past.

                         Vice-President, in the Chair.
                               Geobge       Simonds, Esq.
                  Sculpture, considered apart from Archaeology.
It  was usual, Mr. Simonds remarked, for lecturers on Sculpture to
deal more with Archeology than Art ; he did not, however, intend to
adopt this principle, but should treat his subject from the practical
standpoint of the artist.
     He spoke next of the very wide range of the sculptor's art, and
said that in metal-work especially a man might find himself called
upon to produce a colossal statue to-day and a set of silver tea
spoons to-morrow ; after which he spoke of the two opposed prin
ciples on which all sculptors' work depends, viz., building up, as in
modelling, and cutting down, as in carving, and called attention to
the evil results which ensue when either of these processes is applied
to a material for which it is unsuited, and gave illustrations of this
point in the works of artists of the late seventeenth and of the
eighteenth centuries, showing especially that some of the works of
Bernini which were executed in marble were really more suitable for
bronze.
     Faults in this direction, Mr. Simonds stated, were almost
always the result of very high technical skill, which tempted the
artist to consider it desirable to exhibit a tour de force.                     Even
the Greeks themselves were not always free from this somewhat
                                                                          "
paltry ambition, as was demonstrated by the " Laocoon                        and the
" Group of the Farnese Bull."
    Such splendid misapplication               of power was impossible in the
early periods      of  Art,  when     the   technical difficulties sufficed to keep
the  artist   well  within   the   limits   prescribed by his material.
     The    first  efforts  of  sculpture were always purely imitative, and
where    the   imitation    was    not very successful this was generally due
to lack   of  technical    skill  rather    than to any desire to idealise.     This
was illustrated by       a  series    of  examples of primitive sculpture from
various parts of the world.                The desire for beauty, however, as
understood by       the  early   artist,  frequently induced him to exaggerate
certain points       in   his    work,     often with very grotesque results.
Instances      were   here   given    of   early Etruscan and other sculpture,
showing abnormal length            of  limb   and muscular development

1*93.]      on Sculpture, considered   apart from Archaeology.         59
     It
      was a great advance   in Art when it was known that harmony of
proportion constituted one   of the chief elements of beauty. Canons
of proportion were established and sculpture became a dignified and
beautiful, although, no doubt, to a large extent a conventional art, as
was shown by various examples of Egyptian and Etruscan work.
    The Assyrians and the Greeks made the further discovery that
fresh beauty was to be sought for in rhythm of action and in cor
rectness of construction, as is evidenced in the sculptures of the
Temple at Mgina, in the bas-reliefs from the Palace of Korsabad,
and others ; the Assyrians especially excelling in the rendering of
movement, their sculptures of animals, such as lions, horses, mules,
&c, being of the very highest artistic merit and beauty.
    In all the above works the artist has relied for his effect on pro
portion, on action and correct construction.     He has not concerned
himself  with   the beauty that   is to be found in texture and in the
mobility  of flesh.
     Sculpture  depends on proportion, construction, action and texture
for whatever it may   possess of technical excellence.
     Conventionalism, however valuable in sculpture, is apt to become
wearisome ; then comes an artist, bolder than the rest, who forsakes
in some degree the ancient tradition, and who endeavours, usually
with success, to return more closely to individual Nature ; others
follow and seek to outstrip him in close imitation of Nature, and for
this texture is the quality most in demand.
     An instance of this in the modern Italian school is Magni's
" Reading Girl."
     The lecturer then went on to speak of the practice of painting
statues, admitting that the Greeks used thus to treat them, but
stating that it was not at present possible for us to realise what the
effect must have been of a Greek temple with its brilliant colouring
and polychrome sculpture ; he spoke next of modern attempts to
revive the practice by the late John Gibson and others, which, how
ever, had not been successful ; although it is a common practice with
sculptors to give a slight wash to marble if a warmer tone seems
desirable; and, indeed, the warm tints of old marble are often
successfully imitated by the Italian dealers in forged antiques, such
as are bought by wealthy collectors, and even sometimes find their
way into national museums.
     The intention of sculpture should be, of course, to place before us
a beautiful thought expressed by beautiful form ; such           is,
                                                               however,
not always the sculptor's only desire he too often wishes to advertise
                                        ;
 his own cleverness and to produce work that shall fix the attention of
even the most ignorant and careless observer.       Thus eccentricity  is
 made to do duty for originality, and the ignorance or neglect of all
 the rules of harmony of line and composition         supposed to be the
                                                     is
 triumph of genius over the trammels of conventionality.      The result
is  often very ugly.
     The modern sculptor      under many disadvantages compared with
                             is

 60                        Mr.  George Simonds                 [March  3,
 the old Greek.     We no longer worship physical beauty as they did,
 nor can we easily get models of sufficient beauty and refinement to
 be of much use to us in our work.          Moreover the profession of
 artists' model is a very hard one. requiring patience and a strong
 interest in the work.    In ancient Greece the whole nation were both
 models and connoisseurs.      In London there are hardly half a dozen
 models of either sex that can be considered properly qualified by
 Nature and by education for their profession ; yet London is probably
 not worse off than other Art centres.
      To the modern sculptor, then, only two courses are open ; either
 he roust be content passively to follow the ideal types that have been
 handed down from ages past, in which case his work will certainly
 be lower in the scale of beauty than that on which his ideal is based,
 or he must strive to form an ideal for himself, based on a careful and
 loving study of the most beautiful form that he can find in living
 nature. In other words he must get the best model he can, and work
 as closely to Nature as possible, leaving out or passing lightly over
 such details of form as are blemishes or evidently accidental.      By
 this means we may produce work of great beauty (though perhaps
 not quite equal to that achieved by the Greeks) and also possessed
 of the added charms of vitality and individuality. An over-great
 striving for these two last qualities often results, however, in a
tolerance of downright ugliness.
     Artists, the lecturer declared, were always to be found anxious to
produce whatever the public admired, and if the taste for eccentricity
or ugliness prevailed, the supply would be forthcoming until nausea
ensued, and then a better taste would prevail.      Canova's works were
instanced to show how sudden these changes in style and taste often
                                        "
are, and the highly realistic group of Dcedalus and Icarus
                                                             "
                                                               was com
pared with some of his ideal works of a few years later.
     The leaders in the revolt from the style of the eighteenth century
were Canova, Flaxman and Thorwaldsen, and the movement finally
ended with Gibson and his followers in utter conventionalism and
graceful insipidity.
     Artists no longer try to make imitation antiques but claim the
right to look at Nature for themselves ; and, while respecting the
ancient tradition and teaching of classic art, do not accept these as
being of universal application to their own work.           Where they
transgress them they do so wilfully, and to gain some adequate
advantage.
     Fashion, it was stated, had considerable influence on Art, and was
influenced by it. Thus the artists made beauty fashionable some
fifteen years ago, and beautiful women, Greek tableaux and dresses
were all the rage with the public ; but they soon went out of fashion
again, and no one hears of professional beauties at the present day.
After this there was a demand for character and individuality ; and
sculptors were not slow to see that this could be secured by copying
the living model with painful accuracy.       Coarse knees and angular

1893.]        on Sculpture, considered  apart from Archveology.          61
projecting hips, ill-shaped breasts and bony backs were not spared to
us, and the critics sang their praises, and did thereby much injury to
the public and to the younger artists, who forthwith adopted the
gospel of ugliness.
     The lecturer then described some of the processes employed in
the production of a work of sculpture, and compared the modern
methods with those of the ancients, showing that we now enjoy
technical advantages for the production of sculpture in all materials
far superior to those of former ages. He explained models of various
                                                                    "
instruments used in measuring by sculptors when " pointing            their
statues, as the roughing-out        process is termed, including Kauer's
pointing instrument, and Simonds' Iconograph for proportional point
ing, and described the uses of various tools and appliances used
both for marble and for bronze-work.            The principles of bronze-
casting were illustrated by means of a working diagram, showing the
core inside the mould, the empty space between core and mould to be
occupied by the melted bronze, and the mould itself, with the various
ducts for the metal, and vents to permit the free exit of air and
generated gases.
     Yet with all our technical advantages we were yet deficient in
style compared with the old masters.
     All styles, however, have only their day, since there is none so
noble but that at some time it has been condemned and cast aside, and
none so contemptible but that at some time it has been held to be
the only true art.
      It is difficult to divest ourselves of prejudice in Art, and many a
statue, as for instance, the famous " Esquiline Venus," has had a re
putation made for it by some enthusiastic newspaper correspondent who
happened to be on the spot when it was discovered, and who has
pronounced it to be a Greek work of the very best period.            We are
 apt to forget that there are bad as well as able artists in all periods,
 and that the work of a really good man in a bad period is perhaps
 more valuable than a poor thing that chances to belong to the best
period of Greek art.
      The lecturer then spoke of sculpture as architectural decoration,
 illustrating his remarks with examples from the Zwinger at Dresden,
 and the sculpture of the Marmorbad at Cassel, and expressed regret
 that English architects were so seldom able to induce their clients to
 expend sufficient money on high-class           decorative sculpture, find
 that even our public buildings were left unbecomingly bare.           This
 was to be ascribed to the fact that few even of the so-called " cultured
                                                                           "
 people knew anything of sculpture, and it was most common to see
 in the same house paintings worth thousands of pounds, and close
 beside them, and regarded by their owner with equal complacency,

 room to, but would surely condemn to the melting-pot.          Most of the
 sculptural demand in England is for monumental or portrait work —
 most of it far from satisfactory ; the system of committees and com

petitions being calculated to produce the worst results.    A committeo
of one — who knows what he wants and applies to a capable artist for
it— will always be the most satisfactory.
     The lecturer then spoke of the wholesale destruction of monu
mental statues that had taken place at various dates and in different
countries, as, notably, in France, in 1792, and of the motives that
induced man to erect and to destroy monuments ; and endeavoured
to point out that although no monument is so effective as a sculptural
one, yet it is by no means proved that a full-sized portrait in bronze
of a man and his clothes is the most satisfactory form ; and that
matters might often be improved by confining the portrait to a bust
or a medallion, and allowing allegorical sculpture to complete the
story.
     Various celebrated equestrian monuments were further shown in
illustration, and the lecturer concluded by quoting the words of
Professor Tyndall on the power exerted by a noble monumental work
over the imagination, it being, he said, " capable of exciting a motive
force within the mind which no purely material influence could
generate."

                           Ancient Egyptian Pigments.
 Tn red      pigment used by the Egyptians from the earliest times is a
 native oxide of iron, a haematite.        Most of the large pieces found by
 Mr. Petrie are an oolitic haematite.       One specimen, on analysis, gave
 79-ll per     cent,  and   another   81-34 per cent, of ferric oxide. The
 pieces   to be  used  as   pigments were no doubt carefully selected, and
 the samples that      I  have examined, mostly from Gurob and Eahun,
 are very good in colour.          All the large pieces were of a singular
 shape, having one side smooth and curved ; and in all cases this side
 was strongly grooved with strice, giving somewhat the appearance
 to tbo mass of its having been melted, and allowed to cool in a
 circular vessel. No doubt the explanation of this smooth-curved
 surface is, that these pieces had actually been in part used to furnish
 pigments, and having been rubbed with a little water in a large
 circular vessel, had been ground to this shape.            By experiment it
 was found that these pieces of the native haematite yielded, without
 any further addition by way of medium, a paint which could readily
 be applied      with a brush, as it possesses remarkable adhesive
  properties, and it resembles exactly, in every particular, the red used
  in the different kinds of Egyptian paintings.           In addition to these
  samples of the pigments, all of which are native minerals and in
  their natural conditions, there are other reds, finer in colour and
  smoother in texture, evidently a superior pigment ; these apparently
  have been made from carefully selected pieces of haematite, which
  have been ground and washed, and dried by exposure to the air.
  Some of these pieces are very fine in colour, and it would be difficult
  to match them with any native oxide of iron that is used as a pigment
 at the present day.        There is every reason to believe that this is the
  earliest red pigment which was used, and it remains to this day the
  commonest and most important one ; it is a body unattacked by acids,
  unchangeable by heat, and even moisture and sunlight are unable to
  alter its colour.     At the present time many artificial products are
  used to take the place of this natural pigment.
       Yellow pigments. — These, again, are natural products, and by far
  the most common yellow used by the Egyptians is a native ochre.
 These ochres consist of about one-quarter of their weight of oxide of
 iron, from 7 to 10 per cent, of water, and the rest of their substance
                                                                     v 2

is clay. When moist they have a greasy feel, and work smoothly
and well with the brush.      There is no evidence of these bodies
having changed colour, but undoubtedly they are chemically not
nearly so stable as the red form of oxide of iron. Many of the
pieces of this pigment, found at Gurob and at Tel-el-Armarna, are
very fine in colour.
    Some of the specimens of the very earliest colours of which the
exact history is known, appear to be an artificial mixture of these two
colours, the red and yellow, thus producing an orange colour.     These
 samples were found on a tomb at Medum, which, according to
 Professor Flinders Petrie, was built by Nefermat, a high official and
 remarkable man at the Court of Senefru.        Senefru is known to have
 lived in the fourth dynasty, about 4000 B.C., and to have preceded
 Khufu, the Cheops of the Greeks, who was the great Pyramid
 builder. Now, on Nefermat's tomb the characters and figures are
 incised and filled in with coloured pastes, which     I have been able to
 examine, and it is of interest to know that this use of colour was a
 special device of Nefermat, for on his tomb it is stated that : " He
 made this to his gods in Ms unspoilable writing."     In this unspoilable
 writing the figures are all carefully undercut, so that the coloured
 pastes, so long as they held together, should not be able to drop out.
 All the pastes used are dull in colour, consisting entirely of natural
 minerals.    Haematite, ochre, malachite, carbon, and plaster of Paris
 appear to be the materials used.    Chessylite, as a blue, probably was
 known even at that date, but the artificial blues seem hardly at this
 period to have come into use ; certainly they are not found in the
 specimens of the Nefermat colours which       I
                                               have examined.      Another
 yellow pigment, far brighter in colour, was also often used.        It is a
 sulphide of arsenic, orpiment ; it is a bright and powerful yellow,
 again a body found in nature, but a much rarer body than ochre, and
 consequently, probably was only used for special purposes, when a
 brilliant yellow was required.    As far as it is known at present,
this pigment did not come into use until the eighteenth dynasty.
 Gold might even be placed among the yellow pigments, for it was
 largely used, and with wonderfully good effect. Its great tenacity
 seems to have been fully recognised, for gold is found in very thin
 sheets, and laid on a yellow ground, exactly as is done at the present
day.
      These pigments are then simply natural minerals, no doubt
carefully selected, and sometimes ground and washed previous to
being used ; but the blue colour which is so largely used by the
Egyptians is an artificial pigment, and consequently has far more
interest attached to it than those already mentioned.         It is a body
requiring considerable care and experience to make, and thus its
manufacture enables us to some extent to judge of the knowledge and
ability which its producers had of carrying on a chemical manufac
ture.    No doubt the splendid blue of the mineral chessylite was first
nsed, but certainly in the twelfth dynasty — that      is,about 2500 B.C.

— these artificial blues were used. They are all an imperfect glass,
a frit, made by heating together silica, lime, alkali, and copper ore.*
The number of failures which may have occurred, and how much
material may have been spoilt, cannot be known, but all the blue frit
which I have examined — and it is a considerable amount, some being
raw material, lumps as they came from the furnace, and the rest
ground pigment — all has been, though differing in grain and quality,
well and perfectly made.        Now this implies that the materials have
been carefully selected, prepared, and mixed, and that definite quan
tities of each were taken, this necessitating the carefully measuring or
weighing of each constituent.            An early application of the fun
damental law of chemistry, combination in definite proportion.                 The
amount of copper ore added determined the colour ; with 2 to 5 per
cent, they obtained a light and delicate blue ; with 25 to 30 per cent,
a dark and rather purple blue ; with still more the product would be
black ; if the alkali was too little in amount, a non-coherent sand
resulted ; if too much, a hard, stony mass is formed, quite unsuitable
for a pigment.       The difficulties, however, did not by any means
end with the mixture of the materials.                 For the next process,
the heating, is a delicate operation.         Unfortunately up to the present
time the exact form of furnace in which this operation was carried
on is not known.        The furnaces were probably, especially after use,
very fragile structures, and have passed away.                  Considerable ex
perience in imitating these frits even when using modern furnaces has
 taught me that the operation is really a very delicate one ; the heat
has to be carefully regulated and continued for a considerable length
of time, a time varying with the nature of the frit being prepared ;
and, further, in the rough furnaces used it must have been specially
difficult to have prevented unburnt gases from coming in contact with
the material ; but if they did a blackening of the frit must have
taken place.      However, all these difficulties were avoided, and a frit
was made which exactly answered all the necessary requirements.
It had, for instance, the right degree of cohesion, for many of the
large pieces which have been found have, like the haematite, a smooth,
curved striated surface, and on rubbing in a curved vessel with
water, easily grind to powder.          The powder is naturally much less
adhesive than the haematite powder, but on adding a little medium,
it could at once be used, without other preparation, as a paint.
Some of the pieces vary in colour in different parts.             This may havo

arisen from imperfect mixing, or from some parts of the furnace being
hotter than others.      It hardly appears to be intentional, possibly
some of the dark, purplish-coloured      frits were produced by accident ;
                                 I
large pieces of it have as yet, believe, not been found.         By means of
comparatively     small alterations these frits could be obtained of a
green colour.      One way was by introducing iron.         If, for instance,
the silica used was a reddish coloured sand, it gave a greenish tinge
to the frit ; and frit made with some of the ordinary yellowish desert
sand was found to give a frit undistinguishable from the most com
mon of the old Egyptian frits. Again, a rather strong green colour is
obtained by stopping the heating process at an early stage, this green
frit, simply on heating for a longer time, becoming blue. Another
way in which even the strong-coloured            blue frits have been con
verted into apparently green pigments is by their being coated over with
a transparent but yellowish coloured varnish which has to a remarkable
extent retained its transparency, but no doubt become with age more
yellow, and although strongly green now, may very likely originally
have been nearly colourless, and consequently the frit was then seen
in its original blue colour.    Even as early as the twelfth dynasty the
green frits used were dull in colour, and if by chance a brighter green
was required, then they used the mineral malachite.             No doubt by
far the most brilliant blue used at any time was selected and powdered
chessylite, and even down to the twenty-first dynasty they seem to have
made use generally of somewhat brilliant coloured frits ; but after
that time more subdued colours appear to have been used, and
even the scarabs were made of a much duller colour than formerly.
All these blue frits form a perfectly unfadeable and unchangeable
pigment.     Neither the sun nor acids are able to destroy or alter their
colour.
     The only other pigment to which           I
                                               can refer this evening is the
pink colour which, in different shades, was much used. This is
again an artificial pigment, and belongs to an entirely different
class from any of the foregoing ones, for it is one of vegetable
origin. On simply heating       it, fumes are given off and the colour      is
destroyed, but a   large white residue remains this     ;   sulphate of lime.

It may here be stated that the white pigments used sometimes were
carbonate of lime, but more generally sulphate of lime in form of
 gypsum, alabaster, &c. This substance           often very white in colour,

 texture, which makes     itwork well under the brush        ;and in addition
 to these qualities,it   is
                          a neutral and very stable compound, so      is  well
fitted for the purpose to which       was applied.

 being found native in many parts of Egypt. It               also interesting
                                                            is
 to note that there      isan efflorescence    consisting of this substance
 which frequently occurs in Egypt, and          of a remarkably pure white

to be the most likely way of identifying it. Naturally, madder,
which it is known has from the earliest times been used as a dye, was
the vegetable colouring substance first tried, and it answered perfectly,
giving under very simple treatment the exact shade of colour to the
sulphate of lime which the Egyptian pigment had.                        Essentially
the same colouring matter may have been obtained from another
source, viz. Munjeet.        In the case of madder it is interesting to
note that the colour is not manifest in the plant — the Bubia
tinctorum — for it is obtained from the root, and is even not ready
formed there. In the root it exists as a glucoside, and this has to be
decomposed before the colour becomes manifest.                   In this root there
exists several colouring matters, which are known as madder-red,
madder-purple, madder-orange, and madder-yellow.                   On breaking up
the roots and steeping them in water for some length of time, the
colours come out, some sooner than others, so that the tints vary.
Again, changes of colour are easily obtained by the addition of very
small quantities of iron, lime, alumina, &c., so that in these different
ways a considerable range of colours could be obtained, but a delicate
pink colour was the one probably generally made.                   This colour is
easily  obtained    by simply   stirring  up  sulphate     of  lime  in a tolerably
strong   solution  of  madder,   and   adding    a  little  lime,   taking care to
keep   the   colouring   matter   in  excess;   the   colouring    matter   adheres
firmly  to  the lime  salt, and this  settles on   to  the  bottom   of the  vessel ;
the liquid is then poured off and the solid matter, if necessary, dried,
or mixed — probably with a little gum, and used at once without other
preparation.      That the colouring matter was really madder could
also  be  tested  by another method, viz. by means of spectrum analysis.
Both the madder-red (alazarin) and the madder-purple (purpurin)
give, when the light which they transmit is analysed by the prism,
very characteristic absorption bands ; the purpurin bands are the ones
most easily seen, consequently it became a point of considerable
interest to ascertain whether from a specimen of this pigment, some
thousands of years old, these absorption bands could be obtained.
A small sample of this pink pigment was taken from a cartonage
which was exhibited, and by treating it with a solution of alum, the
colour was thus transferred to the liquid, and by throwing the
absorption spectrum which it gave on the screen, and comparing it
with the spectrum from a madder solution, it was clearly seen to be
identical.

                                    (Abstract.')
The formation of the interference bands, known         as Newton's Rings,
when two slightly curved glass plates are pressed into contact, was
illustrated by an acoustical analogue. A high-pressure flame B (Fig. 1)
is sensitive to sounds which reach it in the direction EB, but is
insensitive to similar sounds which reach it in the nearly perpen
dicular direction AB. A is a " bird-call," giving a pure sound
                            (inaudible) of wave-length (\) equal to
                            about 1 cm. ; C and D are reflectors of
          Fio. 1.           perforated zinc.                If
                                                   C acts alone the flame
                            is visibly excited by the waves reflected
                            from       though by far the greater part of

                            result depends upon the interval between
                            the two partial reflectors.      The reflected
                            sounds may co-operate, in which case the
                            flame flares vigorously     or they may inter
                                                                   ;

                            The first effect occurs when the reflectors are
                           close together, or are separated by any

                                  The coloured rings, as usually formed
                             between glass plates, lose       good deal of
                                                                        a

                             light reflected from the exterior surfaces.
                             The reflection from the hindermost surface
 is easily got rid of by employing an opaque glass, but the reflection
 from the     st surface
            fir              isless easy to deal with.    One plan, used in
 the lecture, depends upon the use of slightly wedge-shaped glasses (2°)

1893.]           on Interference   Bands and their Applications.            73
so combined that the exterior surfaces are parallel to one another, but
inclined to the interior operative surfaces. In this arrangement the
false light is thrown somewhat to one side, and can be stopped by
a screen suitably held at the place where the image of the electric arc
is formed.
     The formation of colour and the ultimate disappearance of the
bands as the interval between the surfaces increases, depends upou
the mixed character of white light. For each colour the bands are
 upon a scale proportional to the wave-length for that colour.           If we
 wish to observe the bands when the interval is considerable — bands
 of high interference as they are called — the most natural course is to
 employ approximately homogeneous light, such as that afforded by a
 soda flame.       Unfortunately, this light is hardly bright enough for
 projection upon a large scale.
      A partial escape from this difficulty is afforded by Newton's ob
 servations as to what occurs when a ring system is regarded through
 a prism.      In this case the bands upon one side may become approxi
 mately    achromatic,   and are thus visible to a tolerably high order, in
 spite  of  the  whiteness  of the light. Under these circumstances there
 is, of course, no difficulty in obtaining sufficient illumination ; and
 bands formed in this way were projected upon the screen.*
      The bands seen when light from a soda flame falls upon nearly
 parallel surfaces have often been employed as a test of flatness. Two
 flat surfaces can be made to fit, and then the bands are few and broad,
 if not entirely absent ; and, however the surfaces may be presented
 to one another, the bands should be straight, parallel, and equi
 distant.     If  this condition be violated, one or other of the surfaces
 deviates from flatness. In Fig. 2, A and B represents the glasses to
 be tested, and C is a lens of 2 or 3 feet focal length.      Bays diverging
 from a soda flame at £ are rendered parallel by the lens, and after
 reflection from the surfaces are recombined by the lens at E. To
 make an observation, the coincidence of the radiant point and its
 imago must be somewhat disturbed, the one being displaced to a
 position a little beyond, and the other to a position a little in front
 of, the diagram.
      The eye, protected from the flame by a suitable screen, is placed
 at the image, and being focused upon A B, sees the field traversed by
 bands.      The reflector 1) is introduced as a matter of convenience to
 make the line of vision horizontal.
      These bands may be photographed.          The lens of tho camera takes
 the place of the eye, and should be as close to the flame as possible.
 With suitable plates, sensitised by cyanin, the exposure required
 may vary from ten minutes to an hour.           To get the best results, the
 hinder surface of A should be blackened, and the front surface of B
 should be thrown out of action by the superposition of a wedge-shaped
    * The theory is given in     a paper upon " Achromatic Interference Bands,"

plate of glass, the intervening space being filled with oil of turpentine
or other fluid having nearly the same refraction as glass. Moreover,
the light should be purified from blue rays by a trough containing
solution of bichromate of potash.       With these precautions the dark
parts of the bands are very black, and the exposure may be prolonged
much beyond what would otherwise be admissible.
    The lantern slides exhibited showed the elliptical rings indicative
of a curvature of the same sign in both directions, the hyperbolic
bands corresponding to a saddle-shaped surface, and the approximately
parallel system due to the juxtaposition of two telescopic " flats,"
kindly lent by Mr. Common. On other plates were seen grooves due

to rubbing with rouge along a defined track, and depressions, some
of considerable regularity, obtained by the action of diluted hydro
fluoric acid, which was allowed to stand for some minutes as a drop
upon the surface of the glass.
    By this method it is easy to compare one flat with another, and
thus, if the first be known to be free from error, to determine the
errors of the second. But how are we to obtain and verify a
standard ? The plan usually followed is to bring three surfaces into
comparison.     The fact that two surfaces can be made to fit another
in all azimuths proves that they are spherical and of equal curvatures,
but one convex and the other concave, the case of perfect flatness not
being excluded.     If A and B fit another, and also A and C, it follows
that B and C must be similar. Hence, if B and C also fit one

 1893.]        on Interference    Band* and their Applications.               75
another, all three surfaces must be flat.             By an extension of this
process the errors of three surfaces which are not flat can be found
from a consideration of the interference bands which they present
when combined in three pairs.
      But although the method just referred to is theoretically complete,
its application in practice is extremely tedious, especially when
the surfaces are not of revolution.             A very simple solution of the
difficulty has been found in the use of a free surface of water, which,
when protected from tremors and motes, is as flat as can be desired.*
In order to avoid all trace of capillary curvature it is desirable to
allow a margin of about 1£ inch. The surface to be tested is sup
ported horizontally at a short distance (1'iT or ,'5 inch) below that of
the water, and the whole is carried upon a large and massive levelling
stand.     By the aid of screws the glass surface is brought into approxi
mate parallelism with the water.            In practice the principal trouble
is in the avoidance of tremors and motes. When the apparatus is set
np on the floor of a cellar in the country, the tremors are sufficiently
exclnded, bat caro must be taken to protect the surface from the
slightest draught.       To this end the space over the water must be
enclosed almost air-tight.         In towns, during the hours of traffic, it
would probably require great precaution to avoid the disturbing
effects of tremors.     In this respect it is advantageous to diminish the
thickness of the layer of water ; but if the thinning be carried too
far, the subsidence of the water surface to equilibrium becomes sur-

prisingly slow, and     a doubt may be felt whether after all there may
 not remain some deviation from flatness due to irregularities of
 temperature.
     With the aid of the levelling screws the bands may be made as broad
 as the nature of the surface admits ; but it is usually better so to adjust
 the level that the field is traversed by five or six approximately parallel
 bands.    Fig. 3 represents bands actually observed from the face of a
 prism.    That these are not straight, parallel, and equidistant is a
 proof that the surface deviates from flatness. The question next

arising is to determine the direction of the deviation.                This may be
effected  by observing the displacement of the bands due to a known
motion of the levelling screws ; but a simpler process is open to us.
It  is evident that if the surface under test were to be moved down
 wards parallel to itself, so as to increase the thickness of the layer of
water, every band would move in a certain direction, viz. towards the
side where the layer is thinnest.           What amounts to the same, the
retardation may be increased, without touching the apparatus, by so
 moving the eye as to diminish the obliquity of the reflection. Suppose,
for example, in Fig. 3, that the movement in question causes the bands
 to travel downwards, as indicated by the arrow.                  The inference is
 that the surface is concave. More glass must be removed at the
ends of the bands than in the middle in order to straighten them.                  If
 the object be to correct the errors by local polishing operations upon
the surface, the rule is that the bands, or any parts of them, may be
rubbed in the direction of the arrow.
      A good many surfaces have thus been operated upon ; and although
a fair amount of success has been attained, further experiment is
 required in order to determine the best procedure.                     There is a
 tendency   to  leave  the    marginal parts      behind    ;  so   that  the bands
though straight    over  the   greater part   of   their   length,   remain  curved
at their extremities.        In some cases hydrofluoric acid has been,
resorted to, but it appears to be rather difficult to control.
     The delicacy of the test is sufficient for every optical purpose.
A deviation from straightness amounting to ^ of a band interval
could hardly escape the eye, even on simple inspection.                  This corre
sponds   to a  departure   from   flatness of   ^    of  a  wave-length in water,
or about ^ of the wave-length in air.            Probably a deviation of TJffX
could be made apparent.
     For practical purposes a layer of moderate thickness, adjusted so
that the two systems of bands corresponding to the duplicity of the
soda line do not interfere, is the most suitable.             But if we wish to
observe   bands   of high interference,    not   only     must    the thickness be
increased,  but   certain   precautions    become      necessary. For instance,
the influence of obliquity must be considered.               If this element were
absolutely   constant,  it  would   entail no  ill  effect.    But   in consequence
of the finite diameter of the pupil of the eye, various obliquities are
mixed up together, even if attention be confined to one part of the
field.    When the thickness of the layer is increased, it becomes
necessary to reduce the obliquity to a minimum, and further to diminish
the aperture of the eye by the interposition of a suitable slit. The
effect of obliquity is shown by the formula
                             2 I CI  -cose)    =   nX.
     Tho necessary parallelism of the operative surfaces may be obtained,
as in the above described        apparatus, by the aid of levelling.          But a
much simpler device may be employed, by which the experimental

 1893.]         on ItUer/erence Bands and their Applications.                   77
 difficulties are greatly reduced.        If  we    superpose a layer of water
 upon a surface    of mercury, the flatness and parallelism of the surfaces
 take care of themselves.       The objection that the two surfaces would
 reflect very unequally may be obviated by the addition of so much
dissolved colouring matter, e.g. soluble aniline blue, to the water as
shall equalise the intensities of the two reflected lights.            If the ad
justments    are  properly   made,  the  whole   field,  with the exception of a
margin    near   the sides   of the  containing     vessel, may   be  brought to
one degree    of  brightness, being    in  fact all  included  within  a fraction
of a band. The width of the margin, within which rings appear, is
about one inch, in agreement with calculation founded upon the
known values of the capillary constants.             During the establishment
of equilibrium      after  a disturbance,    bands    are seen due to variable
thickness, and when the layer is thin, persist for a considerable time.
      When the thickness of the layer is increased beyond a certain
point, the difficulty above discussed, depending upon obliquity, be
comes excessive, and it is advisable to change the manner of obser
vation to that adopted by Michelson. In this case the eye is focused,
not, as before, upon the operative surfaces, but upon the flame, or
rather upon its image at E (Fig. 2).             For this purpose it is only
necessary to introduce an eye-piece of low power, which with the lens
C (in its second operation) may be regarded as a telescope.                  The
bands now seen depend entirely upon obliquity according to the
 formula above written, and therefore tako tho form of circular arcs.
Since the thickness of the layer is absolutely constant, there is
nothing to interfere with the perfection of the bands except want of
homogeneity in the light.
     But, as Fizeau found many years ago, the latter difficulty soon
becomes serious.        At a very moderate thickness it becomes necessary
to reduce the supply of soda, and even with a very feeble flame a
limit is soon reached.         When tho thickness was pushed as far as
possible, the retardation, calculated from the volume of liquid and
the diameter of the vessel, was found to be 50,000 wave-lengths,
almost exactly the limit fixed by Fizeau.
     To carry the experiment further requires still mora homogeneous
 sources of light.        It is well known that Michelson has recently
observed interference with retardations previously unheard of, and
 with the aid of an instrument of ingenious construction has obtained
 most interesting information with respect to the structure of various
 spectral lines.
      A curious observation respecting the action of hydrofluoric acid
 upon polished glass surfaces was mentioned in conclusion.              After the
 operation of the acid the surfaces appear to be covered with fine
 scratches, in a manner which at first suggested the idea that the glass
 had been left in a specially tender condition, and had become scratched
 daring tho subsequent wiping.          But it soon appeared that the effect
  was a development of scratches previously existent in a latent state.
 Thus parallel lines ruled with a knife edge, at first invisible even in

a favourable       light, became conspicuous after treatment with acid.
Perhaps     the  simplest way of regarding the matter is to consider the
case of a furrow with perpendicular           sides and a flat bottom.    If the
acid may be supposed to eat in equally in all directions, the effect will be
to broaden the furrow, while the depth remains unaltered.                  It is
possible      that   this  method    might be employed      with  advantage to
intensify (if photographic
                 a                  term may    be  permitted) gratings ruled
upon glass for the formation of spectra.

                                   Seals.
Sir William Flower began by recalling that about two years ago
Lord Salisbury, while taking a comprehensive survey of the general
state of international politics, remarked that there were, happily,
then, no graver subjects to excite the anger and jealousy of rival
nations than seals and lobsters, and it was to the study of the habits
of these animals that the energies of diplomatists         were mainly
directed.   In the present lecture it was proposed to speak only of
seals, and, taking the common seal as a type, he described its general
character and position in the Animal Kingdom.         The lecturer then
passed in review the distinctive traits and geographical     distribution
of the various allied species of true seals, and pointed out their
economic uses and mode of capture.        The next animal treated of was
the walrus, and finally, the third group into which the seals are
divided — the eared-seals, sea-lions, or sea-bears. These differ from
the true seals in possessing small external ears, and in the power of
using their hind feet in walking on land like ordinary quadrupeds.
It is animals of this group which yield the beautiful fur called
" sealskin " in commerce, and the lecture was illustrated
                                                                by speci
mens of this fur in various stages of preparation.        The wholesale
destruction of fur-seals which formerly went on throughout the
southern hemisphere was next spoken of, and a more detailed account
given of the very remarkable habits of the species from the Behring
Sea, which for many years has been the main source of supply of
sealskin dresses, and the right of capture of which is now the subject
of controversy between Great Britain and the United States. After
giving an outline of the questions, as far as they related to the
natural history of the animals, to be placed before the arbitrators, he
concluded by saying that we can scarcely be too grateful to the
statesmen of both nations for having so far agreed as to bring the
whole of this difficult and complicated question before such a tribunal
as that now sitting at Paris.

      Possible and Impossible Economies    in the Utilisation of Energy.
The importance of the subject is not difficult to understand if you
realise the enormous results — so large as to be even of national
interest — which depend upon what can and what can not be done in
the way of utilising energy.      Economy in energy may mean wealth
and prosperity to a nation ; waste in energy may mean diminished
commerce and general depression.
                       I
     As an engineer, am bound to take my stand at once on the firm
basis that practically nothing is impossible except perpetual motion.
In essence all the things which     I  shall have to characterise as impos
sible are really perpetual motions, or what is the same thing, attempts
to get more out of something than there is in it.
     It is familiar to even the least mechanical in this room that there
are, in Nature, vast —     I  dare not say inexhaustible— sources from
which we can obtain energy by certain more or less familiar processes.
I  say
        " obtain " energy, using the most familiar expression, but per
haps the word is not a very happy one.          We require energy to light
lamps, to smelt metals, to drive factories, to pull trains, but in no case
do we obtain it ready made as we draw water from a well.            There is
plenty of it in existence, plenty to be had, but to get it in the form
in which we want it we have always to transform it from some other
form to the required one.
     There is in every electric lighting station in this city, for instance,
first a transformation of the natural energy of chemical combination
into heat, then the transformation of heat energy into mechanical
energy in a steam engine, then the transformation of the mechanical
energy into electrical energy in the dynamo, and lastly the trans
formation of electrical energy into light, and also very largely back
again into heat, in the lamp.
     Often the transformations are not so numerous as in this case, but
they always exist to some extent, and all the possibilities and impos
sibilities of which   I have to speak are practically related to some or

 other     of these transformations.  About them are three fundamental
 facts which    I willask you to note.
      1.   Every transformation of energy is accompanied by some waste
of energy.
      2.   Every transformation occurs in absolute accordance with certain
phenomena which reproduce themselves so exactly that they have come
to be  called physical laws.
      3.All the quantities which can appear in every transformation
are as exactly measurable and have been as exactly measured as could
be the temperature of this room, or the breadth of Albemarle Street.
     As to the first point,
       "
" loss because the
                                  I
                               use the expression " waste
                                                            "
                                                              rather than
                      energy cannot well be said to be lost. The amount
of energy wasted in a transformation is measured by noting what is
called the efficiency of the transformation, which is usually expressed
as a percentage.    A transformation with only one per cent, loss, for
example, would be said to have an efficiency of 99 per cent., and so
on.   Perpetual motions are simply transformations of 100 per cent,
efficiency.
     In spite of the great and admitted imperfection of our knowledge
of the physical universe,     Ithink it is not impossible to arrive at some
 understanding as to how far the knowledge which we have can be held
 to be final, and how far or in what directions it is provisional.                           I
mean, of course, so far as affects our particular object of saying what
is, and what      not, possible in one special direction.
                 is
     It seems perhaps contradictory, but think         I      true, that our
                                                                      it   is
superstructure in physical knowledge           much more solid than our
                                                      is
foundation.    Our knowledge of the ultimate constitution of matter,
and particularly of the ultimate constitution of
                                                      " not-matter," cannot
be said to be accurate as yet.     But higher up in the scale matters are
different, and         as well that we should remember that there are
                   it
                   is
physico-chemical facts and numbers that are just as fully established,
although they refer to phenomena which we cannot entirely follow, as
are the figures of the Nautical Almanac.
    Let me take the combustion of coal as an example with the
external phenomena of which we are all familiar. Chemists have
analysed the coal and know of what            consists so much carbon, so
                                                                                             /
                                                    it            ;
much hydrogen, so much oxygen they have measured for us that its
                                             ;
elements in the combustion enter into various combinations, so that they
can tell us exactly the maximum amount of heat energy which can be
given out by the burning of given weight of coal. Yet
                                      a                           have oftenI
enough met people who were quite convinced that they possessed the
secret by which an amount of heat equal to double this quantity could
somehow be obtained.        The finality of our knowledge in this respect
is quite independent of our ignorance of the ultimate nature of the
coal or of the combustion.
 I     have taken the phenomena of combustion as among those with
which every one         fairly familiar.
                         is                 Let us deal with       for   few    it       a

minutes further in special illustration of my subject. Fig. 1 shows
fairly accurately how far we have got in working at the efficiency of
this kind of transformation.               We start with a given amount of
potential energy,       known    within   very narrow limits, represented for us
by     a pound   of  coal   with a  sufficient   weight of circumambient atmo
sphere.       Let   us  represent    this  known      amount of energy, as in the
                                            figure, by 100 per cent.               What

                                            burnt    in  the    furnace,    say,  of   an

                                            may see what often enough happens
                                            in every-day careless working ; on
                                            the right hand you may see what

                                            that the amount of heat taken up
                                            by the steam varies from 50 to 80
                                            per cent, of the whole heat ; that a

                                            to nothing, is lost in imperfect com

                                            carbonic oxide ; that a very much

                  STEAM                     and otherwise.         Now    I  ask you to
                                            notice particularly two things, first,
  20                                        looking at the right hand of the
                                            diagram, how much there is still
                                            possible.     The efficiency of the pro
   10-                                      cess is about 80 per cent.               The
                                            remaining      20  per   cent.   is  all that
                                            can be saved.       Of this some portion
                                            must go in heating the chimney
                                            gases.     It is the price paid for the
 draught     of the  chimney.      We    must   also  lose  something by radiation ;
 that is inevitable.        We cannot look, therefore, to any very astound
 ing increase of economy in boiler work over the best that has been
 done.      Secondly,     I ask you to notice what an enormous amount is

possible on the left-band side of the diagram which is impossible
on the right — impossible, that is, because it has already been attained.
Half of our possibilities — indeed, far more than half our possibilities
—are of improving up to the best ; it is infinitely harder to improve
up from the best.
     When any one tells us that he has invented something, or some
method, by which one ton of coal goes as far as two, we may know
for certain one of two things ; either he has made a mistake (which is
possible enough) or else his standard of comparison has been unfor
tunately chosen. Hundreds of thousands of pounds have been thrown
away on elaborate schemes which, at best, could do no more than
bring bad and careless practice up to a level passed every day in
places where care and common sense have been expended on the same
matter.    Plenty of room exists for raising the general average
efficiency of boiler work ; for, if the average working all over the
country were brought up to the standard of the best, there would,
probably, be one-third less coal used every year than is now actually
burnt.
     The process which we have discussed is, perhaps, really rather to
be called a transference than a transformation ; at any rate, it falls
into the category of transformation whose theoretical maximum
efficiency is 100 per cent., or, allowing for absolutely inevitable
losses, perhaps 90 per cent. But with many processes with which we
have to do, unfortunately, our maximum theoretical efficiency is only
25 per cent., and instead of attaining 80 per cent, even of this we are
often happy enough with half as much.
     In the very great majority of instances the mechanical energy
 which we utilise is originally obtained from the heat of combustion,
transferred to some liquid or gaseous body, and by it made to cause
certain parts in a machine to move, and to do mechanical work for us.
     Now the actual cycle of physical process, isothermal, adiabatic,
isodynamic or what not, which the steam or air or gas may go through
is often a very complicated one, sometimes so complicated that it is a
matter of considerable difficulty to say beforehand exactly what the
maximum theoretical efficiency is.      We always, however, know two
things about it : first, that it is always far less than 100 per cent. ;
second, that it cannot exceed — and in all practical cases must fall
considerably short of— a certain known limiting value much less
than 100 per cent.       This limiting value is the very familiar one

is the   working   difference of temperature.  The value of the ratio

    In any actually possible steam engine the actual process differs
so much from the ideal that not more than 20 or 25 per cent.
                                                                    (out of
the 30 per cent. just mentioned) could be attained even if the process
were carried out perfectly.     But there are very great difficulties in
the way of carrying out even this imperfect process at all completely,
and so it comes about that, in the final results, only from 5 to perhaps
                                     15 per cent. of the whole heat of

                                     given to the steam, but that fraction
                                     of it (25 or 30 per cent.) which it
                                     is physically conceivable that any
                                     actual engine should turn into work.
                                          The space between a and 6 shows
                                     the losses due to the fact that the
                                     engine works in a cycle far inferior
                                     to the best possible cycle. The space
                                     between b and c shows the further
                                     losses which do actually occur in
                                     fact, the area under c being all that
                                     is utilised.
                                          What possibilities are there of
                                     increasing the theoretical maximum
                                     efficiency of an engine ? The whole
                                     matter depends upon whether we
                                     can increase the value of the fraction
                                     T—~-T — ?.   We can do this obviously
                                     by either making T, higher or Ta
                                     lower, or both.     It is not difficult
                                     to see how this matter comes out
                                     practically.    In all heat engines
                                     some fluid or other is used as a
                                     vehicle for the transformation       of
                                     heat into work. It may be coal gas
                                     or producer gas, steam, air alone, or
                                     air mixed with the products of com
bustion, or even ether or ammonia.          With steam we work between
the temperatures of, say, 60° or 400° F., or thereabouts.          Quite at
the other end of the scale come engines worked by gas of different
kinds, where combustion actually takes place inside the engine and
not in a furnace, and where the highest temperature may, perhaps, be

as great as 2000°     F. Hot air occupies an intermediate position.
With ether or ammonia the temperatures are all very much lower.
From our present point of view it is necessary to remember that all
these divers working fluids work under the same physical laws and
limitations. How, then, do they stand in reference to this problem
of economy ?
    First of all, the mere nature of no one gives it any thermo-dynamic
advantage over the others.      The fact that steam can be liquefied
in a condenser is a great convenience to us, but does not make                       it,
per se, one whit worse or
better than air, which can-                     Fiq.                   3.

     From Fig. we may gather that with gas engines the theoretical

efficiency    already so high that we need hardly trouble ourselves
              is
about attempting to raise it. With gas, in fact, and to         smaller          a
extent with air, the possibility of improvement lies in bringing the
actual up to the theoretical process, and not in attempting to raise
the efficiency of the latter. With steam, however,      different. We  it   is
want much to raise the theoretical limit of efficiency.   But here we

88                    Profettor Alex. B. W. Kennedy            [April 21,
are dealing with a material which is liquid at ordinary temperatures
and pressures, so that in its working condition it is a vapour and not
a gas, and its temperature cannot be raised without at the same time
raising its pressure. Considerations of safety and strength of our
materials become here very important, but even if we left them out of
account altogether, and raised the value of the maximum working
pressure of steam engines from its present limit of 10 atmospheres to
20 atmospheres — that is, 100 per cent. — we should have increased the
theoretical maximum efficiency only about 10 per cent., a quantity
hardly worth considering in such a case.
    No doubt the direction in which to seek for improvement is in
that of what is called super-heating the steam, or raising its tempera
ture after it has been formed—converting the vapour into gas without
increasing its pressure.      Theoretically this can be done to any
extent, and   I have no doubt that within the next coming years it will
be very largely done.     It is no new idea, although it is only recently
that the use of mineral lubricants in engines has made it thoroughly
practicable.    The losses between b and c in Fig. 2 are due to many
causes, but chiefly to two.     The first of these is that the steam is
thrown away at too high a pressure — i.e. that it is not expanded
sufficiently far in the cylinder. Mechanically this is remediable at
once, but only at the cost of making the engine unduly large and
costly for its work.      This cause of loss is, therefore, likely to
remain.     The second is one about which there has been much con
troversy both here and abroad, but which, thanks to the work of such
men as Willans and Cotterill and Donkin, is now much cleared up.
It is simply this — that as the fresh hot steam is always admitted to a
cylinder which has just been emptied of steam having a much lower
temperature, a cylinder, moreover, which is made of excellently
conducting material, a very large proportion of that steam is at
once converted into water on entrance, so that for every cubic foot
of steam which leaves the boiler and passes along the pipes perhaps
only two-thirds, or even half or less, does work in the cylinder as
steam ; the rest passes through the engine as water. It is sometimes
partially re-evaporated, but never in such fashion or at such time as
to be of much real service in doing work.        Here truly is a field for
economy, and one with very great possibilities.
     I have talked long about steam engines. The subject is tempting,
at least tempting to me, and, after all, steam is still the working
fluid par excellence.     But   I must not forget that my subject has
many branches, and must look at some of the others.
     The future of gas engines is one which has great possibilities ; we
have seen that they represent, in fact, the highest existing theoretical
maximum efficiency.      Up to a certain point their progress was asto
nishingly rapid; at present, for a few years, they have more or less
stood still, although the number of them has continually multiplied.
Just now there are signs that the manufacturers —just possibly it

1893.]              on Economies     in the Utilisation   of Energy.      89
mav have something to do with the pressure of severe competition —
are going to do their best to move forward a little, to make larger
and faster running machines, and, in fact, to make an effort to pene
trate   further into the country where the steam engine has for so
long held undisputed sway.               About this we must not concern
ourselves here, however.          The maximum theoretical efficiency of a
gas engine is about 80 per cent., or nearly three times as great as in
a steam engine.       It is obvious that this figure is so high that we
need hardly       attempt to raise           it,
especially as we are so far from                           Fig. 4.
actually realising         itas yet.     In
Fig.    4   the theoretical maximum
efficiency is taken as 100 per cent.,
in   the same way as in Fig.            and
                                       2,
the line    b  shows how much of this
is   actually turned into work, the
area above      b representing the lost
energy.      The greatest cause of loss,
that above the line         is represented
                           c,
by the heat taken from the water
surrounding the cylinder. The fact
is  that we are trying to obtain incom
patible results. To reach the high
efficiency we make the initial tem
perature very high. But, then, any
such temperature would melt up our
machines altogether,             the metal
                                if
were only allowed to reach it.           We
have, therefore, to adopt the some
what barbarous expedient of con
tinually keeping the metal cool by
a   current of water passing through
a  jacket. This water must of neces
sity pick up all the heat which can
get through the metal and carry              it
away to waste.      Although, therefore,
our theoretical maximum efficiency
is   so much greater than that of            a
steam engine, our actual efficiency
is   not nearly so great (comparing
 the lines  c in Fig. and
                       2        in Fig. 4).
                                 b
 Notwithstanding       this,   the   actual
 energy utilised per     thermal    unit  of
 combustion heat in      a gas engine       very considerably greater than in
                                            is
a   steam engine.     Undoubtedly, very great possibilities for increased
 economies exist here.
     I   have reserved to the end some discussion of possibilities and

90                   Professor Alex.   B. W. Kennedy            [April 21,
impossibilities in connection with some complete industrial processes.
Let us take first the generation and distribution of electricity, a
matter which is of such keen interest now to so many of us, whether
from the point of view of economy in production or economy in our
quarter's bills 1
     The various stages of Fig. 5 tell a tale which, perhaps, may
interest you.     They represent the gradually degenerative process by
which the chemical energy of combustion is converted into electric
light. To the left hand of the diagram is represented the boiler
process, and the various transformations are represented from left to
right, until the lamps are arrived at on the right hand of the figure.
 Similar letters are used in each section of the figure for similar
quantities of energy.       In each section the losses of the section
before are written off, and the heat actually carried forward is called
 100 per cent. K represents the losses in the boiler, which is assumed
 to have an efficiency of 80 per cent.     H represents waste mainly due
 to condensation in steam pipes, and also to the driving of pumps,
 and other such losses inevitable in a central station.          The third
 section represents the whole heat which        has been  received by that
 portion of the steam which actually found its way to the main
 engines, and of this, Q is the part unavoidably lost from thermo
 dynamic limitations. In Section IV. the heat actually received by
 the engine is called 100 per cent. Of this, the area F is wasted, and
 the remainder turned into work.         Section V. shows the whole heat
 turned into work by the engine as 100 per cent., of which the area
 E represents the energy necessary to drive the engine itself, which,
 therefore, never reaches the dynamo.          In Section VI. the energy
 received by the dynamo is taken as 100 per cent., and the area D
 represents the dynamo losses, which are wonderfully small.             The
 energy — now in the form of electrical energy — which leaves the
 terminals of the dynamo, is represented by 100 per cent, in Section
 VII. Of this, a certain proportion, sometimes small, sometimes
 large, but here represented by C, is expended in mains, transformers,
 or batteries, and never reaches the lamps. Finally, at the right-
 hand side of the figure we get the energy received by the lamps as 100
 per cent., out of which only the small, almost insignificant quantity
 A is turned into light, the huge remainder B being once more
 converted into heat.    If  the size of the area A in Section I. be looked
 at, it will be seen what an insignificant quantity of the whole heat of
 combustion is actually and finally turned into its intended purpose.
      The result savours a little of the ludicrous.       Let us go back
 and review its possibilities.     The losses K,   I need not deal further
 with. H represents losses about which we engineers feel very sore,
 and which sometimes try our temper and our patience greatly,
 and which are particularly persistent and hard to get rid of.
 G and F,     I  have already dealt with. E and D do not look very
 promising as fields for radical improvement.        There are few things

devoting time and thought to the matter, which may even enable
us to multiply many fold the amount of light which we can obtain
from a given quantity of energy.
     There is yet another direction in which possible economy is to
be looked for, a very fascinating        one, and by no means an un
promising oue. Look for a moment again at Fig. 5. Except only
the process at the lamp itself, all the transformations have fair
economy, so good that one sees at once that no radical defect
exists in them.        But cannot some of these be done away with
altogether ? It is the number of them that tells, and brings down the
final result.
     If an ordinary gas engine be substituted for a steam engine we
cut out one transformation altogether.      The boiler losses disappear,
or rather, such corresponding losses as exist occur in the gasworks.
At the same time we substitute the higher efficiency of the gas
engine for the lower of the steam engine, which may be a very
important matter.        It is practically equivalent to cutting G out
altogether.
     Of another kind is the possibility at present much talked of,
the substitution namely, not only of a gas engine for a steam engine,
but at the same time also of a gas producer for a boiler, so that the
motor fluid should be producer gas made on the premises and not
steam or coal gas from public mains.         There seems no doubt that
the combination, although it does not much reduce the number of
transformations, gives under certain conditions a very high economy of
fuel indeed.     I  do not think the evidence before us is as yet suffi
cient, although    I hope it shortly will be, to enable us to say how
far under ordinary working conditions the actual combined efficiency
of the whole plant will be distinctly greater than that of existing
systems.
     [The lecturer dealt with the question of the utilisation of dust
bin refuse, of the economic efficiency of electric tramways and of
compressed air transmission, illustrating these by diagrams.         He
discussed also the effect of "load factor" on economic problems.
He then concluded as follows :— ]
     To sum up the whole matter in the way of possibilities and
impossibilities,   there does not seem to be anything very startling
before us in the way of possible economies, except in the two direc
tions of efficiency of lamps as light producers, and of bringing up
 gas engines to their theoretical maximum. In other respects matters
 are running along lines which       I have endeavoured to indicate, and
along which they will doubtless develop more or less rapidly, but
always less and less rapidly as they get nearer their limiting effi
ciency.    There is no one point in which we have not some measure
ments which enable us to set bounds to the possibility of improvement
along any known lines, and thus we have means for gauging the
 value of the pretensions made by each new method, or scheme, or

estimating     its  possible  value numerically.   For   those  of  us who are
not born to be inventive geniuses there           is  always    the   consoling
thought that the difference between good engineering and bad
engineering in economy, with the very same materials,              isvery much
greater    than    the  difference   between   good engineering and any
probable improvements upon          it.  And   meantime,    we find our hands
sufficiently   full  in trying  to keep up  to the  best   existing standards,

on a  little further.

   Si a James Criohton-Browne, M.D. LL.D. P.R.S. Treasurer and
                       Vice-President, in the Chair.
                    Francis Gotoh, Esq. M.A. F.E.S.
                  The Transmission   of a Nervous Impulse.
 The lecturer opened with     a short account of the present state of our
 knowledge as to the anatomical structures of nerve-fibres.
      He then described and repeated the experiments of Helmholtz,
 made 50 years ago, with the object of ascertaining the rate at which
 a nervous impulse was conducted along a nerve-fibre.         These experi
 ments form the basis of our more exact knowledge as to that capacity
 for transmission which is the peculiar vital function of nerves.
      The essential feature in the process is the power which each in
 dividual part of the living nerve-fibre possesses of awakening in
 response to a sudden change in its physical environment, this property
 being expressed by the term
                                  " excitability " ; in the transmission of
 the nervous impulse each successive individual part awakens in
 consequence of the subtle changes present in its aroused neighbours.
 The awakening thus travels along the nerve as a flame along a fuse.
      The power of transmitting a change, and the power of initiating
 such change in response to a stimulus, in other words, conduction
 and excitability, are thus brought into correlation.
      The lecturer then proceeded to demonstrate and describe experi
 ments carried out by Mr. J. S. Macdonald and himself, in the
 Physiological Laboratory of University College, Liverpool, upon
 this subject, these experiments having been made in order to ascer
 tain how far these two properties, (a) of responding to an external
  stimulus, (6) of transmitting the nerve impulse started by such a
 stimulus, could be considered as identical.
      In order to ascertain this, an agent was used to modify, on the
 one hand, the capacity of the nerve to be aroused by physical agencies,
 and on the other, its power of transmitting an impulse when aroused.
  The agent employed was a localised alteration in temperature, and
  experiments were described and demonstrated which showed that
  whereas cooling to 5° C. tended to block the transmission, such
  cooling, far from rendering the nerve less responsive to external
  stimuli, made it more readily affected by the stimulating influence
  of a large number of physical agencies.      Such agencies were shown
  to bs (1) galvanic currents, (2) condenser discharges, (3) mechanical

  1893.]         on The Transmission  of a Nervous  Impulse.            95
  blows, (4) chemical reagents. To all these the nerve responded
  better when cooled, though it transmitted the nerve impulse pro
  duced by such response with greater difficulty.     To one agent only
 did the nerve respond less readily when under the influence of
  localised cold ; this was the induced electrical current.
      It thus appears necessary to reconstruct our view of the nature
 of the process during nerve transmission, for the two events in the
 nerve, the response to external stimuli and the power to transmit
 such response, are affected in a diametrically opposed manner by
 such a simple change as alteration in the nerve's temperature.      The
 favourable influence of localised cold on the response of excitable
 tissues to external stimulation was further displayed by description
 and demonstration of the effects produced when muscles, and not
 nerves, were the objects of experiment.     In all cases cold favoured
 the capacity of the muscle to reply to the stimulus.
      Finally, the lecturer brought forward some observations which
 appeared to show that in addition the transmitting power of a nerve is
 largely affected by the nature of the agent which started the nerve
 impulse.    We have found it possible to arouse a nerve by a galvanic
 current in two ways : (1) so that localised cooling of a portion of the
 conducting path will favour the passage of the impulse (the normal
condition), and (2) so that the same localised cooling will block the
impulse.     It would thus seem that nervous impulses, when started
 on their journey along nerves, bear throughout that journey some
impress of the agent which started them, and hence, that the im
 pulses which are initiated by even slightly different physical agencies,
and are then transmitted along nerve-fibres, differ from one another
 as regards the character of some fundamental quality.
     Professor Gotch concluded that these and other recent observa
tions gave experimental proof that the property of transmission
possessed by nerves is correlated, not merely with that of excitability,
but largely with the source, and thus the nature of the impulse, so
that the unknown molecular changes which form the living basis of
such transmission in any one nerve-fibre are not the same for all
impulses, but change with the source of each.

                        Fogs, Clouds and Lightning.   .
The air, as every one knows, is composed almost entirely of the two
gases, oxygen and nitrogen.        It also contains small quantities of
other substances, of which the chief are carbonic acid gas and water
vapour, and it is the latter of these constituents, water vapour, or
" steam " as it is sometimes called, that will
                                                  principally concern us
this evening.
     The quantity of invisible water vapour which the air can at any
time   take up depends upon the temperature ; the higher the tem
perature of the air the more water it can contain.        The proportion,
however, never exceeds a few grains' weight of water to a cubic foot
of air.   Air at any temperature, containing as much water as it can
possibly hold, is said to be
                                 " saturated," while the temperature at
which air containing a certain proportion of water becomes saturated
is called the " dew point."
     The water vapour contained in the atmosphere plays a very im
portant part in many natural phenomena. Among other things, it
is the origin of clouds and of fogs.    If a body of air containing water
in the form of invisible vapour is quickly cooled to a temperature
below its dew point, a portion of the vapour becomes condensed into
a number of minute liquid particles of water, forming a visible mist,
which, when it is suspended in the upper regions of the air, is called
a cloud, and when it rests upon the surface of the earth is only too
familiarly known as a fog.
     The cooling of water-laden air may be brought about in various
ways, resulting in the formation of clouds of several distinct char
acters.    [Photographic examples of cumulus, stratus and cirrus
clouds were exhibited upon the screen.]       For experimental purposes
a small body of air may be most conveniently cooled by allowing it
 to expand.   I  have here a flask of air which can be connected with
 the partially exhausted receiver of an air-pump.       Inside the flask is
 an electrical thermometer or thermo-junction,         the indications of
 which can be rendered evident to all present by the movement of a
spot of light upon a scale attached to the wall.        A deflection of the

spot of light to the left indicates cold, to the right, heat. When the
stop-cock is opened so that a portion of the air escapes from the flask
into the air-pump receiver, you see at once a violent movement of
the spot of light to the left, showing that the expansion of the air is
accompanied by a fall of temperature.         If more air from the room
is allowed to enter the flask, the spot moves in the opposite direction.
     The large glass globe, upon which the beam from the electric
lantern is now directed, contains ordinary air, kept in a state of
saturation, or nearly so, by the presence of a little water.    You will
observe that although heavily laden with water vapour the air is
perfectly transparent.     If, now, we turn a tap and so connect the
globe with the exhausted receiver, the air expands and becomes
colder ; the space inside the globe is no longer able to hold the same
quantity of water as before in the form of vapour, and the excess is
precipitated as very finely divided liquid water — water dust it may be
called — which fills the globe and is perfectly visible as a cloud or
mist.    In a few minutes the cloud disappears, partly, no doubt,
because some of the particles of water have fallen to the bottom of
the vessel, but chiefly because the air becomes in time warmed up
to its original temperature (that of the room), and the suspended
water is converted back again into invisible vapour.
     Now let us repeat the experiment, and before the cloud has time
to disperse let us admit some fresh air from outside ; the cloud, as
you see, vanishes in an instant.      The compression of the air raises
the temperature above the dew point, and the small floating particles
of water are transformed into invisible vapour.
     I once more rarefy the air, and admit a fresh supply while holding
the flame of a spirit-lamp near the orifice of the inlet pipe, so that
some of the burnt air is carried into the interior of the globe.   When
the air is again expanded a cloud is formed which is, as you observe,
far more dense than the others were. It appears on examination
that the increased density of this cloud is not due to the condensa
tion of a greater quantity of water. Little, if any, more water is
precipitated than before. But the water particles are now much more
numerous, their increased number being compensated for by dimin
ished size.    Within certain limits, the greater the number of particles
into which a given quantity of water is condensed, the greater will
be the apparent thickness of the mist produced.       A few large drops
will not impede     and   scatter  light  to the same  extent as a great
number of small ones, though the actual quantity of condensed water
may be the same in each case.
     Then comes the question, why should the burnt air from the
flame so greatly increase the number of the condensed drops ?          An
answer, though perhaps not quite a complete one, is furnished by
some remarkable experiments made by M. Coulier, a French pro
fessor, nearly twenty years ago.           He believed his experiments
pointed   to the conclusion   that  water  vapour would not condense at
all, even at temperatures far below the dew point, unless there were

 present in the air a number of material particles to scire as nuclei
 around which the condensation could take place.              All air, he says,
 contains dust; by which term he does not mean such dust as is
 rendered evident in this room by the light scattered along the track
 of the beam issuing from the electric lantern, which consists of
 comparatively gross lumps of matter, but particles of ultra-micro
 scopical dimensions,
                             " more tenuous than the motes seen in a
 sunbeam."        It is upon such minute specks of matter that water
 vapour is condensed.        Anything that increased the number of dust
 particles in the air increased the density of the condensation by
 affording a greater number of nuclei. Air in which a flame had been
 burnt he supposed to be very highly charged with finely-divided
 matter, the products of combustion, and thus rendered extraordinarily
 " active " in bringing about condensation. And that, according to
Coulier's view, is the reason why such a dense fog was formed when
air which had been contaminated by the spirit flame was admitted to
 our globe.
     On the other hand, air, even burnt air, which has been filtered
through tightly packed cotton wool, is found to be perfectly inactive.
No cloud or mist will form in             it,

saturated.       Coulier explained this fact by supposing that the process
 of filtration completely removed all dust particles from the air.

     The experiments of Coulier were repeated and confirmed by
 Mascart.      The latter also made one additional observation which
may very probably turn out to be of great importance.               He found
that ozone, or rather, strongly ozonised air, was           very active mist

activity by filtration.
     Four or five years later, all the facts which had been noticed by
Coulier, and others of an allied nature, were independently discovered
by Mr. Aitken, who has devoted much time and study to them and
made them the foundation of an entirely new branch of meteorology.
     Later, perhaps, we may see reason to doubt whether all the
conclusions of Coulier and Aitken are quite accurate, especially as
regards the action of so-called products of combustion.
     What has been said so far applies equally to the generation of
clouds and of country fog, for           pure unadulterated fog, such as
                                              a

surface of the earth.       The fogs, however, which afflict many large
towns, and London in        a marked degree, appear to possess      character

colour, which has sometimes been likened to that of pease sonp : their
 density is abnormal, so is their persistence ; and they often occur
 when the temperature of the air is considerably above the dew point.
 But what renders them especially objectionable is their acrid and
 corrosive quality, in virtue of which they exert a highly deleterious
 action upon animal and vegetable life.
     The uncleanness of a town fog is of course due to the sooty and
 tarry matters with which it is charged, and which are derived from
the smoke of innumerable fires. Its other and more mischievous
 specialities are mainly attributable to certain products of the com
 bustion of sulphur, a substance which exists in relatively large
proportions (from half to one per cent.) in nearly all varieties of
coal.
     We may make a sample of London fog in the glass globe by
 burning a little sulphur near the orifice of the inlet pipe while air is
being admitted ; and in order to prevent the entrance of any solid
particles of sublimed sulphur, we will filter the air through a little
cotton wool.      The fog formed when the air is expanded far exceeds
in density any we have yet seen. The globe appears almost as if it
were filled with something that could be cut with a knife.
     This is hardly the time or the place to discuss the possible
methods by which town fogs might be abolished as such, or rendered
as innocuous as those of the country.       It is impossible to doubt that
year by year they are increasing in virulence, and when the burden
of the evil becomes too grievous to be borne, as is likely to be the
case before many more winters are past, the remedy will perhaps be
found in the compulsory substitution of gas for coal as the ordinary
domestic fuel.
     Every one has noticed how dense and dark a thundercloud is. It
shuts out daylight almost as if it were a solid substance, and the
glimmer that penetrates it is often imbued with a lurid or copper-
coloured tint.
      I had always found it rather difficult to believe that these
peculiarities were due simply to the unusual extent and thickness of
the clouds, as is commonly supposed to be the case, and it occurred
to me about three years ago, that perhaps some clue to the explana
tion might be afforded by the electrification of a jet of steam.       On
making the experiment        Ifound that the density and opacity of the
jet were greatly increased when an electrical discharge was directed
upon      it,
           while its shadow,     cast upon
                                 if     a    white screen by sufficiently

strong light,    was aof  decidedly reddish-brown tint.
     As    a possible explanation of the effect  I   suggested that there
might occur some action among the little particles of water of          a
similar nature to that observed by Lord Eayleigh in his experiments
upon water jets.      Perhaps you will allow me to show his fundamental
experiment     before further discussing the steam jet.
   A   jet  of  water  two or three feet long
                                            is   made to issue in
                                                                a  nearly
vertical direction from  a  small nozzle.    At certain distance above

the nozzle the continuous stream is found to break up into separate
drops, which collide with one another, and again rebounding, become
scattered over a considerable space.      But when the jet is exposed to
the influence of an electrified substance, such as a rubbed stick of
sealing wax, the drops no longer rebound after collision, but coalesce,
and the entire stream of water, both ascending and descending, becomes
nearly continuous.       Look at the shadow of the jet upon the screen
and notice what a magical effect the electrified sealing wax produces.
                                          I
     There is one other point to which wish to direct your particular
attention.      If  the sealing wax, or better, the knob of a charged
Leyden jar, is held very close to the jet, so that the electrical
influence is stronger, the separate drops do not coalesce as before, but
become scattered even more widely than when no electrical influence
was operating.       They become similarly electrified and, in accordance
with the well-known law, repel one another.
     We will now remove the water jet, and in its place put a little
apparatus for producing a jet of steam.      It consists of a half-pint tin
bottle, through the cork of which passes a glass tube terminating in a
nozzle. When the water in the bottle is made to boil a jet of steam
issues from the nozzle, and if we observe the shadow of the steam jet
upon the screen we shall see that it is of feeble intensity and of a
neutral tint, unaccompanied by any trace of decided colour.              A
bundle of needles connected by a wire with the electrical machine is
placed near the base of the jet, and when the machine is worked
electricity is discharged into the steam.         A very striking effect
 instantly follows. The cloud of condensed steam is rendered dense
and dark, its shadow at the same time assuming the suggestive
yellowish-brown colour.
     I  at first believed that we had here a repetition, upon a smaller
 scale, of the phenomenon which occurs in the water jet. The little
 particles of condensed water must frequently come into collision with
one another, and it seemed natural to suppose that, like Lord Itay-
 leigh's larger particles, they rebounded under ordinary circumstances,
and coalesced when under the influence of electricity. The great
 majority of the small particles ordinarily formed consisted,   I  thought,
 of perhaps only a few molecules, which were dispersed in the air
 and again converted into vapour without ever having become visible,
 while the larger particles formed by their coalescence under electrical
 action were of such dimensions as to impede the more refrangible
 waves of light.      Hence the brownish-yellow colour.
     Other explanations have been proposed. There is the molecular
 shock theory of the late It. Helmholtz (who, as it turned out, had
 studied electrified steam jets before    I  made my own experiments) ;
  I shall refer to his speculation later. And there is the dust-nucleus
  theory, which no doubt appears a very obvious one.
      Though    I  knew that my own hypothesis was not quite free from
  objection, neither of these alternative ones commended itself to me as
  preferable ; and so the matter rested until a few months ago, when

102                         Mr. Shelford Bidtcell                    [May   5,
the steam jet phenomenon was discussed anew in a paper communicated
to the Royal Society by Mr. Aitken.            Mr. Aitken said that he did
not agree with my conjecture as to the nature of the effect.             This
led me to investigate the matter again, and to make some further
 experiments, the results of which have convinced me that              I  was
clearly in error. At the same time it seems to me that the ex
planation which Mr. Aitken puts forward is little less controvertible
than my own. Mr. Aitken's explanation of the phenomenon is, like
mine, based upon Lord Rayleigh's work in connection with water-
jets, but, unlike mine, it depends upon the experiment which shows
that water particles when strongly electrified are scattered even more
widely than when unelectrified.           He believes, in short, that elec
 trification produces the effect, not by promoting coalescence of small
 water particles, but by preventing            such coalescence as would
naturally occur    in the  absence   of  electrical influence. In the elec
trified jet, he says,   the  particles are smaller but at the same time
 more numerous ;     thus  its apparent density is increased.
       The chief flaw in my hypothesis lies in the fact that the mere
 presence of an electrified body like a rubbed stick of sealing wax,
 which is quite sufficient to cause coalescence of the drops in the
 water jet, has no action whatever upon the condensation of the steam
 jet. There must be an actual discharge of electricity.           But it is by
 no means essential, as Mr. Aitken assumes, that this discharge should
  be of such a nature as to electrify, positively or negatively,           the
  particles of water  in the  jet.  If, instead  of using  a single electrode,
  we employ two, one positive and the other negative, and let them
  spark into each other across the jet, dense condensation at once
  occurs.   [Experiment.] So it does if the two discharging points are
  removed quite outside the jet. [Experiment.] A small induction coil
  giving sparks an eighth of an inch in length causes dense con
  densation when the electrodes are more than an inch distant from
  the nozzle and on the same level. [Experiment.] In one experiment
  a brass tube two feet long was fixed in an inclined position with its
  upper end near the steam jet, and its lower end above the electrodes
  of the induction coil. In about three seconds after the spark was
  started dense condensation ensued, and it ceased about three seconds
  after the sparking was stopped. No test was needed, though in
  point of fact one was made, to show that the steam was not electrified
  to a potential of a single volt by this operation.            And the time
  required for the influence to take effect showed that whatever this
  influence might be it was not induction.
       The inference clearly is that in some way or other the action is
  brought about by the air in which an electrical discharge has taken
  place, and not directly by the electricity itself. The idea has no
  doubt already occurred to many of you that it is a dust effect.
  Minute particles of matter may be torn off the electrodes by the
  discharge, and form nuclei upon which the steam may condense.
   The experiments of Liveing and Dewar have indeed shown that small

 particles are certainly thrown off by electrical discharge, and the
 idea that such particles promote condensation appears to be sup
 ported by the fact that if a piece of burning material, such as touch-
 paper, is held near the jet so that the products of combustion can
 pass into it, thick condensation      is
                                       produced.     [Experiment.]

minute dust particles.            it
 high priest and chief apostle of the philosophy of dust, gives no
countenance to the nucleus theory.          He does not even advert to its
possibility.   I   imagine that his experiments have led him, as mine
have led me, to the conclusion that               untenable.

portion may not be larger than         pin's head, at once darkens the jet.

      :
naturally arises, whether incandescent matter may not be sufficient

is  seen to be quite as effective as the burning touch-paper.            Yet
here there can be no nuclei formed of products of combustion, for
there is no combustion     ;there    simply ignition or incandescence.

inert dust — in virtue of which it acquires an abnormal                       power of
promoting aqueous condensation.
     I  thought that possibly some clue as to the nature of this property
might be obtained by observing how some other gases and vapours
behaved ; but though the experiments                    I  made perhaps tend to
narrow the      dimensions     of  the  mystery,     I  cannot     say that they have
completely solved         it.   Indeed    some    of   the   results   only introduce
additional perplexities.
     One of the most natural things to try is hydrochloric acid, which
 is known to have a strong affinity for water.                If  we heat a little of
 the acid solution in a test-tube, closed with a cork, through which a
 glass tube is passed, and direct the issuing stream of gas upon the
jet, the densest condensation results. [Experiment.] The vapours
 of sulphuric and nitric acids also cause dense condensation, and I sup
pose both of these have an affinity for water.                 But so also, and in an
equally powerful         degree,   does   the   vapour     of  acetic acid ; yet the
affinity  of   this  acid  for water,  as  indicated     by   the heat evolved when
 the two are mixed, is very small.
     Ammonia gas, when dissolved in water, causes the evolution of
much heat. Yet a stream of this gas directed upon the jet has no
action.     [Experiment.]
     Ozonised air, which Mascart found so effective in his experiments
with the closed vessel, is quite inoperative with the steam jet.
Equally so is the vapour of boiling formic acid, which                     I believe is
chemically a much more active acid than acetic, and has a lower
 electrical resistance.       (See Table.)

      It seems that we have here a pretty little problem which might,
  perhaps, be solved without much difficulty by a competent chemist,

bat which quite      baffles me.*        Is it possible that the condensing
vapours may contain dissociated atoms ?
      To return to the electrical effect. There are only two kinds of
chemical change that      I know of which could be brought about in air
by an electrical discharge.        Either some of the oxygen might be con
verted into ozone, or the oxygen and nitrogen of the air might be
caused to combine, forming nitric acid or some such compound.              The
former of these would not account for the action of the air upon the
jet, because, as we have seen, ozone is inoperative ; the latter might.
But if the activity of the air is due to the presence in it of a com
pound of oxygen and nitrogen, then it is clear that an electrical
discharge in either nitrogen or oxygen separately would fail to
render those gases active.
      I arranged a spark bottle, inside which an induction-coil discharge
could be made to take place ; two bent tubes were passed through
the cork, one reaching nearly to the bottom for the ingress of the gas
to be tested, the other, a shorter one, for its egress. The open end
of the egress tube was fixed near the steam jet, and first common air,
then oxygen and then nitrogen were successively forced through the
bottle while the coil discharge was going on. All produced dense
condensation, but    I thought that oxygen appeared to be a little more
efficient than common air and nitrogen a little less.
      This last experiment points to a conclusion to which at present          I
see no alternative.      It is that the action on the jet of an electrical
discharge is due in some way or other to dissociated atoms of
oxygen and nitrogen.        There is nothing else left to which it can be
due.
      So far as Robert Helmholtz's explanation coincides with this
conclusion    I think it must be accepted as correct. As to the precise
manner in which he supposed the dissociated atoms to act upon the
jet, it is more difficult to agree with him.            He thought that the
abnormal condensation was a consequence of the molecular shock
caused by the violent recombination of the dissociated atoms in the
 supersaturated air of the jet, the action being analogous to that
 which occurs when a supersaturated solution of sulphate of soda, for
 example, is instantly crystallised by a mechanical shock.
      To me this hypothesis, ingenious as it is, seems to be more
 fanciful than probable, but         I can only hint very diffidently at an
 alternative one.    To many chemical processes the presence of water
 is favourable or even essential. Is it possible that the recombination
 of free atoms may be assisted by water ? And is it possible that
 dissociated atoms in an atmosphere of aqueous vapour may obtain
 the water needed for their union by condensing it from the vapour ?
      According to Helmholtz, flames and incandescent substances
 generally cause dissociation of the molecules of oxygen and nitrogen
     * Two chemists of the
                             highe st eminence have been good enough to consider
 the problem for me, but they are unable to throw any light upon it.

in the surrounding air. This,         I believe, is generally admitted.       I do
not know whether slowly oxidising phosphorus has the same effect.
    If it is conceded that the atmospheric gases are dissociated by
electrical discharges, and that the presence of such dissociated gases
somehow brings about the dense condensation of water vapour, we

 may still regard the electrified steam jet as affording an illustration
 of the abnormal darkness of thunder-clouds.
     Perhaps another source of dissociated atoms is to be found in the
 ozone which is generated by lightning flashes. A molecule of ozone
 consists of three atoms of atomic oxygen, while one of ordinary
 oxygen contains only two. Ozone is an unstable kind of material

1893.]                   on Fog, Clouds and Lightning.                  107
and gradually relapses into ordinary oxygen, the process being that
one atom is dropped from the three-atom molecules of ozone, these
detached atoms in course of time uniting with one another to form
pairs. Thus two molecules of ozone are transformed into three of
oxygen.       A body of ozone is therefore always attended by a number
of dissociated atoms which are looking for partners.
      In the steam jet experiment there is not time for the dis
engagement of a sufficient number of isolated atoms from a blast of
ozone to produce any sensible effect.       But the case is otherwise when
the vapour is confined in a closed vessel, as in Mascart's experiment,
or when it occurs in the clouds, where the movement of air and vapour
is comparatively slow.
      Ozone, it will be remembered, was found by Mascart to produce
dense condensation in a closed vessel even after being filtered through
cotton wool.       Similar filtration seems to entirely deprive the so-
called products of combustion of their active property, a fact which
has been adduced as affording overwhelming evidence in favour of
 the dust nucleus theory.       Coulier himself, however, detected a weak
point in this argument. He produced a flame which could not
 possibly have contained any products of combustion except steam,
by burning pure filtered hydrogen in filtered air ; yet this product
 was found to be perfectly capable of causing dense condensation, and,
as in his former experiments, filtration through cotton wool deprived
 it of its activity.
       These anomalies may,     I think, be to a great extent cleared up if
 we assume      that the effect of the cotton wool depends, not upon the
 mere mechanical obstruction it offers to the passage of particles of
 matter, but upon the moisture which it certainly contains, and which
 may act by attracting and facilitating the reunion of dissociated
 atoms before they reach the air inside the vessel. According to this
 view ozone would remain an active condenser in spite of its fil
 tration, because free atoms would continue to be given off by it after
 it had passed the cotton wooL The filtration experiment should be
 tried with perfectly dry cotton wool, which, however, will not be
 easily procured, and if my suggestion is right, dry wool will be
  found not to deprive ordinary products of combustion of their con
 densing power.
       To sum up.      I  think my recent experiments show conclusively
 that the dense condensation of the steam jet is not due directly either
  to electrical action or to dust nuclei. The immediate cause is pro
  bably to be found in dissociated atoms of atmospheric gases, though
  as to how these act we can only form a vague guess.
       The discourse concluded with some remarks upon atmospheric
  electricity, and the exhibition of lantern photographs of lightning
  flashes.

Thb first isoperimetrical problem known in history was practically
solved by Dido, a clever Phoenician princess, who left her Tyrian
home and emigrated to North Africa, with all her property and a
large retinue, because her brother Pygmalion murdered her rich
uncle and husband Acerbas, and plotted to defraud her of the money
which he left. On landing in a bay about the middle of the north
coast of Africa she obtained a grant from Hiarbas, the native chief
of the district, of as much land as she could enclose with an ox-hide.
She cut the ox-hide into an exceedingly long strip, and succeeded in
enclosing between it and the sea a very valuable territory* on which
 she built Carthage.
     The next isoperimetrical        problem on record was three or four
hundred years later, when Horatius Cocles, after saving his country
by defending the bridge until it was destroyed by the Romans behind
him, saved his own life and got back into Rome by swimming the
 Tiber under the broken bridge, and was rewarded by his grateful
 countrymen with a grant of as much land as he could plough round

     In Dido's problem the greatest value of land was to be enclosed
 by a line of given length.         If the land is all of equal value the
 general solution of the problem shows that her line of ox-hide should

be laid down in a circle.   It shows also that if the sea is to be part
of the boundary, starting, let us say, southward from any given
point A of the coast, the inland bounding line must at its far
end cut the coast line perpendicularly.        Here, then, to complete
our solution, we have a very curious and interesting, but not at all
easy, geometrical  question to answer : — What must be the radius of
a circular arc A  D C, of given length, and in what direction must it
leave the point A, in order that it may cut a given curve ABC per
pendicularly at some unknown point C ?       I don't believe Dido could
have passed an examination on the subject, but no doubt she gave a
very good practical solution, and better than she would have found if
she had   just mathematics enough to make her fancy the boundary
ought to be a circle.   No doubt she gave it different curvature in
different parts to bring in as much as possible of the more valuable
parts of the land offered to her, even though difference of curvature
in different parts would cause the total area enclosed to be less than
it would be with a circular boundary of the same length.
     The Roman reward to Horatius Cocles brings in quite a new
idea, now well known in the general subject of isoperimetrics : the
greater or less speed attainable according to the nature of the
country through which the line travelled over passes.          If it had
been equally easy to plough the furrow in all parts of the area offered
for enclosure, and if the value of the land per acre was equal
throughout, Cocles would certainly have ploughed as nearly in a

 circle as he could, and would only have deviated from a single
 circular path if he found that he had misjudged its proper curvature.
 Thus, he might find that he had begun on too large a circle, and, in
order to get back to the starting point and complete the enclosure
before night-fall, he must deviate from it on the concave side ; or
he would deviate from it on the other side if he found that he had
begun on too small a circle, and that he had still time to spare for
a wider sweep.       But, in reality, he must also have considered the
character of the ground he had to plough through, which cannot but
have been very unequal in different parts, and he would naturally
vary the curvature of his path to avoid places where his ploughing
must    be very slow,    and to choose those where    it would  be most
rapid.
     He must also have had, as Dido had, to consider the different
value of the land in different parts, and thus ho had a very complex
problem to practically solve.       He had to be guided both by the
value of the land to be enclosed and the speed at which he could
plough according to the path chosen ; and he had a very brain-trying
task to judge what line he must follow to get the largest value of
land enclosed before night.
     These two very ancient stories, whether severe critics will call
them mythical or allow them to be historic, are nevertheless full of
scientific interest.  Each of them expresses a perfectly definite case
of the great isoperimetrical   problem to which the whole   of dynamics
is reduced by the modern mathematical methods of Euler, Lagrange,
Hamilton and Liouville (Liouville's Journal, 1840-1850).              In
Dido's and Horatius Cocles' problems, we find perfect illustrations
of all the fundamental principles and details of the generalised
treatment of dynamics which we have learned from these great
mathematicians of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
     Nine hundred years after the time of Horatius Cocles we find, in
the fifth Book of the collected Mathematical and Physical Papers
of Pappus of Alexandria, still another idea belonging to isoperimetrics
— the economy of valuable material used for building a wall ; which,
however, is virtually the same as the time per yard of furrow in Cocles'
ploughing.     In this new case the economist is not a clever princess,
nor a patriot soldier ; but a humble bee who is praised in the intro
duction to the book not only for his admirable o bed i ence to the
Authorities of his Republic, for the neat and tidy manner in which
he collects honey, and for his prudent thoughtfulness in arranging
for its storage and preservation for future use, but also for his know
                                            "
ledge of the geometrical truth that a         hexagon can enclose more
honey than a square or a triangle with equal quantities of building
material in the walls," and for his choosing on this account the
hexagonal form for his cells.      Pappus, concluding his introduction
with the remark that bees only know as much of geometry as is
practically useful to them, proceeds to apply what he calls his own
superior human intelligence to investigation of useless knowledge

 and gives results in his Book V., which consists of fifty-five theorems
 and fifty-seven propositions on the areas of various plane figures
 having equal circumferences.            In this Book, written originally
 in Greek, we find (Theorem IX. Proposition X.) the expression
 " isoperimetrical figures," which is, so far as       I  know, the first use of
 the adjective " isoperimetrical
                                     " in
                                           geometry ;    and we may,   I believe,
justly regard Pappus      as the   originator,   for mathematics,    of   isoperi
 metrical problems, the designation technically given in the nineteenth
 century* to that large province of mathematical and engineering
 science in which different figures having equal circumferences, or
 different paths between two given points, or between some two points
 on two given curves, or on one given curve, are compared in con
 nection with definite questions of greatest efficiency and smallest
 cost.
      In the modern engineering of railways an isoperimetrical problem
 of continual recurrence is the laying out of a line between two towns
 along which a railway may be made at the smallest prime cost. If
 this were to be done irrespectively of all other considerations, the
 requisite datum for its solution would be simply the cost per yard of
 making the railway in any part of the country between the two towns.
 Practically the solution would be found in the engineers' drawing
 office by laying down two or three trial lines to begin with, and
 calculating the cost of each, and choosing the one of which the cost is
 least. In practice various other considerations than very slight
 differences in the cost of construction will decide the ultimate choice
 of the exact line to be taken, but if the problem were put before a
 capable engineer to find very exactly the line of minimum total cost,
 with an absolutely definite statement of the cost per yard in every
 part of the country, he or his draughtsmen would know perfectly
 how to find the solution.        Having found something near the true
 line by a few rough trials they would try small deviations from the
 rough approximation, and calculate differences of cost for different
 lines differing very little from one another. From their drawings
 and calculations they would judge by eye which way they must
 deviate from the best line already found to find one still better.            At
 last they would find two lines for which their calculation shows no
 difference of cost.   Either of these might be chosen ; or, according to
judgment,    a line  midway between them, or somewhere between them,
 or even not between them but near to one of them, might be chosen, as
 the best approximation to the exact solution of the mathematical
problem which they care to take the labour of trying for.                But it is
clear that if the price per yard of the line were accurately given
(however determined or assumed) there would be an absolutely
definite solution of the problem, and we can easily understand that the
skill available in a good engineer's drawing-office would suffice to find
the solution with any degree of accuracy that might be prescribed ;

          You must not imagine that suggest, as a thing of practical
engineering, the attainment of minute accuracy in the solution of a
problem thus arbitrarily proposed ; but it is interesting to know that
there is no limit to the accuracy to which this ideal problem may be
worked out by the methods which are actually used every day by
engineers in their calculations and drawings.
     The modern method of the " calculus of variations," brought into
the perfect and beautiful analytical form in which we now have it by
Lagrange, gives for this particular problem a theorem which would
be very valuable to the draughtsman if he were required to produce
an exceedingly accurate drawing of the required curve.           The curva
ture of the curve at any point is convex towards the side on which
the price per unit length of line is less, and is numerically equal to the
rate per mile perpendicular to the line at which the Neperiau loga
rithm of the price per unit length of the line varies. This statement
would give the radius of curvature in fraction of a mile.          Ifwe wish
to have it in yards we must take the rate per yard at which the
Neperian logarithm of the price per unit length of the line varies.
I   commend the Neperian logarithm of price in pounds, shillings
and pence to our Honorary Secretary, to whom no doubt it will
present a perfectly clear idea ; but less powerful men would prefer to
reckon the price in pence, or in pounds and decimals of a pound.           In

every possible   case         subject                                   gives
a theorem of curvature less simple in all other ca-es than in that
very simple case of the railway line of minimum first cost, but
always interpretable and intelligible according to the same prin
ciples.
     Thus in Dido's problem we find by the calculus of variations
 that the curvature of the enclosing line varies in simple proportion
to the value of the land at the places through which it passes ; and
the curvature at any one place is determined by the condition that
the whole length of the ox-hide just completes the enclosure.
     The problem of Horatius Cocles combines the railway problem
with that of Dido.      In it the curvature of the boundary is the sum
of two parts ; one, as in the railway, equal to the rate of variation
perpendicular to the line, of the Neperian logarithm of the cost in
time per yard of the furrow (instead of cost in money per yard of the
railway) ; the other varying proportionally to the value of the land
as in Dido's problem, but now divided by the cost per yard of the
line, which is constant in Dido's case.     The first of these parts, added
to the ratio of the money-value per square yard of the land to the
money-cost per lineal yard of the boundary (a wall suppose), is the
curvature of the boundary when the problem is simply to make the
most you can of a grant of as much land as you please to take pro
 vided you build a proper and sufficient stone wall round it at your
own expense.     This problem, unless wall-building is so costly that
 no part of the offered land will pay for the wall round     it,  has clearly
                                                               I        2

a determinate finite solution if the offered land is an oasis surrounded
by valueless desert.        It has also a determinate finite solution even
though the land be nowhere valueless, if the wall is sufficiently
more and more expensive at greater and greater distances from some
place where there are quarries, or habitations for the builders.
     The simplified case of this problem, in which all equal areas of
the land are equally valuable, is identical with the old well-known
Cambridge dynamical plane problem of finding the motion of a par
ticle relatively to a line of reference revolving uniformly in a plane :
                                                         "

culation, and suggests a graphic method for finding solutions by
which not uninteresting approximations * to the cusped and looped
orbits of G. F. Hill f and Poincare J can be obtained without dis
proportionately great labour.
     In the dynamical problem, the angular velocity of the revolving
line of reference is numerically equal to half the value of the land
per square yard ; and the relative velocity of the moving particle is
numerically equal to the cost of the wall per lineal yard in the land
question.
     But now as to the proper theorem of curvature for each case ;
both Dido and Horatius Cocles no doubt felt it instinctively and
were guided by it, though they could not put it into words, still less
prove it by the " calculus of variations."          It was useless knowledge
to the bees, and, therefore, they did not know it ; because they had
only to do with straight lines.         But as you are not bees 1 advise you
all, even though you have no interest in acquiring as much property
as you can enclose by a wall of given length, to try Dido's problem
for yourselves, simplifying it, however, by doing away with the
rugged coast line for part of your boundary, and completing the
enclosure by the wall itself. Take forty inches of thin soft black
thread with its ends knotted together and let it represent the wall ;
lay it down on a large sheet of white paper and try to enclose the
greatest area with it you can. You will feel that you must stretch
it in a circle to do this, and then, perhaps, you will like to read
Pappus (Liber V. Theorema II. Propositio II.) to find mathematical
demonstration that you have judged rightly for the case of all equal
areas of the enclosed land equally valuable.             Next try a case in

practical accuracy     the   proper shape of the wall to enclose the
greatest value  of  the land   that can be enclosed by forty miles of wall.
When you     have  done   this  you will understand exactly the subject of
the calculus of variations, and those of you who are mathematical
students may be inclined to read Lagrange, Woodhouse, and other
modern writers on the subject.           The problem of Horatius Cocles,
when not only     the   different   values   of the land in different places
but also the different speed of the plough according to the nature
of the ground through which the furrow               is  cut are taken into
consideration,   though more complex and difficult,                still quite
                                                                   is
practicable by the ordinary graphic method of trial and error.              The
analytical method of the calculus of variations, of which          I have told
you the result, gives simply the proper curvature for the furrow in
any particular direction through any particular place. It gives this
and it  cannot give anything but this, for any plane isoperimetrical
problem whatever, or for any isoperimetrical problem .on                 agiven
curved surface of any kind.
    Beautiful, simple, and clear as isoperi metrics       is in geometry, its
greatest interest, to my mind,     is  in its dynamical applications.      The
great theorem of least action, somewhat mystically and vaguely pro
pounded by Maupertuis, was magnificently developed by Lagrange
and Hamilton, and by them demonstrated to be not only true
throughout the whole material world, but also        a  sufficient foundation
for the whole of dynamical science.
    It would require nearly another hour        if
                                                 I    were to explain to you
fully this grand generalisation for any number of bodies moving
freely, such as the planets and satellites of the solar system, or any
number of bodies connected by cords, links, or mutual pressures
between hard surfaces, as in   a  spinning-wheel, or lathe and treadle, or
a steam engine, or a crane, or     a   machine of any kind but even
                                                               ;             if  it
were convenient to you to remain here an hour longer,              I fear that
two hours of pure mathematics and dynamics might be too fatiguing.
I must, therefore, perforce limit myself to the two-dimensional, but
otherwise wholly comprehensive, problems of Dido and Horatius
Cocles.    Going back to the simpler included case of the railway of
minimum cost between two towns, the dynamical analogue                 this —

 point moving in a piano under the influence of a given conservative
 system of forces, that is to say, such a system that when material
 particles not mutually influencing one another are projected from one
 and the same point in different directions, but with equal velocities,
 the subsequent velooity of each is calculable from its position at any
 instant, and all have equal velocities in travelling through the same
 place whatever may be their directions.          The theorem of curvature,
 of which     I   told you in connection with the railway engineering
 problem, is now simply the well-known elementary law of relation
 between curvature and centrifugal force of the motion of a particle.
     The motion of a particle in a plane is, as Liouville has proved, a
 case to which every possible problem of dynamics involving just two
 freedoms to move can be reduced.          But to bring you to see clearly
its relation to isoperi metrics,     I must tell you of another admirable
 theorem of Liouville's, reducing to a still simpler case the most
general     dynamics       of two-freedoms motion.         Though not all
mathematical experts,       I am sure you can all perfectly understand the
simplicity of the problem of drawing the shortest line on any given
convex surface, such as the surface of this block of wood (shaped to
illustrate Newton's dynamical theory of the elliptic motion of a
planet round the sun) which you see on the table before you.                  I
solve the problem practically by stretching a thin cord between the
two points, and pressing it a little this way or that way with my
fingers till    I  see and feel that it lies along the shortest distance
between them. And now, when            I tell you that Liouville has reduced
to this splendidly simple problem of drawing a shortest line
(geodetic line it is called) on any given curved surface every
conceivable problem of dynamics involving only two freedoms to
move,    I am sure you will understand sufficiently to admire the great
beauty of this theorem.
     The doctrine of isoperimetrical problems in its relation to dy
namics is very valuable in helping to theoretical investigation of an
exceedingly important subject for astronomy and physics — the stability
of motion, regarding which, however,         I can only this evening venture
to show you some experimental illustrations.

double-edged sword covered with flowers was thrust into its baby-
hands. Just as the highest joys which are known to us are those of
the imagination, so also are our deepest sorrows — the sorrows of our
fantasy.   Love, ambition, heroism, the sense of beauty, virtue itself,
become intensified by the imagination, until they reach that acute and
passionate expression which renders them potent factors for good or
evil in individuals. Even so has the imagination ever been the
strongest power in fostering the aspirations, in shaping the destina
tions of nations.     It is the vision through whose lens we see the
realities of life, either in the convex or in the concave, diabolically
distorted or divinely out of drawing.    ...
     " Can acting be taught ? " is a question which has
                                                        been theoretically
propounded in many a magazine article, and has vexed the spirit of
countless debating societies. It is answered in practice on the stage
and,  I think, triumphantly answered in the negative. Acting, in fact'
is purely an affair of the imagination — the actor more than any other
artist may be said to be the " passion-winged minister of thought."
Children are born actors. They lose the faculty only when the
wings of their imagination are weighted by self-consciousness.        It is
not every one to whom is given the capacity of always remaining a
child. It is this blessed gift of receptive sensibility which it should
be the endeavour (the unconscious endeavour, perhaps) of every artist
to cultivate and to retain.     There are those who would have us be
lieve that technique is the end and aim of art. There are those who
would persuade us that the art of acting is subject to certain mathe
matical laws, forgetting that these laws are but the footnotes of
adroit commentators, and in no sense the well-springs of art. What
I  venture to assert is that all that is most essential, most luminous
in acting may be traced to the imaginative faculty.        It is this that
makes the actor's calling at once the most simple and the most com
plex of all the arts. It is this very simplicity which has caused
many to deny to acting a place among the arts, and which has so often
baffled those who would appraise the art of acting as a precise science
and measure it by the yard-measure of unimaginative criticism. Yet
in another sense no art is more complex than the dramatic art in its

highest expression, for in none is demanded of its exponent a more
delicate poise, a subtler instinct ; none is more dependent on that
acute state of the imagination, on that divine insanity which we call
genius.    The actor may be said to rank with, if after, the poet. He,
like the poet, is independent of recognised laws.      The histrionic art
is indeed essentially a self-governed one. Its laws are the unwritten
laws of the book of nature, illuminated by the imagination.        But if
the actor can claim exemption from academic training, it would be
idle to affirm that he is independent of personal attributes, or that he
can reach any degree of eminence without those accomplishments
which the strenuous exercise of art alone can give. His Pegasus,
however, should be tamed in the broad arena of the stage rather than
in the enervating stable of the academy. In acting, in fact, there is
an infinity to learn, but infinitely little that can be taught.      The
actor must be capable, of course, of pronouncing his native language,
and of having a reasonable control over the movements of his limbs,
but thus equipped, his technical education is practically complete.
He is his own " stock-in-trade."     The painter has his pigments, the
poet his pen, the sculptor his clay, the musician his lute ; the actor
is limited to his personality — he plays upon himself.      To give free
range to the imaginative quality is the highest accomplishment of the
actor. He whose imagination is most untrammelled is he who is most
likely to touch the imagination of an audience. To arrive at this
emancipation of the mind is his ultimate and highest achievement.
The development of this sensitive or receptive condition depends
largely on the surrounding influences of life. A general knowledge
of men and things is, of course, the first essential ; but       I  doubt
whether education, in its accepted sense, is so necessary or indeed
desirable in an artistic career as it is in what     I may call the more
concrete walks of life. What is meat to one is often poison to the
other.    The midwife of science is sometimes the undertaker of art.
I  have touched upon what, in its restricting influence on the imagi
native faculty,  I  have called the pernicious habit of reading books — a
 practice which in its too free indulgence may tend to fetter the
exercise of that imagination and that observation of life which are so
 essential to the development of the artist.    Some people are educated
 by their memories, others by observation, aided by the imagination.
 One man will be able by a look at a picture, or by the scanning of
 an old manuscript, to project himself into any period of history ;
 while another will by laborious unimaginative study acquire no more
 artistic inspiration than can be obtained by learning the • Encyclo
                     '
 paedia Britannica by heart.      I  have often noticed that those who
 devote their spare energies to indiscriminate reading acquire a habit
 of thinking by memory, and thus gradually lose the faculty which
 the spontaneous observation of life tends to quicken.     Their thought
 becomes artificial — they think by machinery — originality loses its
 muscle ; the memory is developed at the expense of the imagination.
 Take any incident of everyday life — to the man who is not in the

 122                       Mr. Herbert Beerbohn Tree                        [May 26,
 babit of exercising his imagination it will appear as a vulgar fact ; to
 him who sees the, same incident with the dramatic, the ^imaginative
 eye, it will give birth to an original thought, which is often more
 vital than a quotation.
     The education of the artist, then, should be directed rather to the
development of the imagination than to the storage of facts. For
purposes of immediate information the British Museum is always
open to him ; the judges of the land are ever ready to set him right
on points of law into a misapprehension of which a too lively imagi
nation may have led him.          I  am so bold as to think that an university
education, which is so propitious to success in other callings may
be a source of danger to the artist.            The point of view is apt to
become academic, the academic to degenerate into the didactic, for
all cliques, even the most illustrious, have a narrowing tendency.
The development of those qualities which are so favourable to dis
tinction in other callings may tend to check in the artist that origi
nality which is so essential to the exercise of our fascinating, if fan
tastic, calling. The very social advantages which an university career
brings may tend to inculcate a conventional regard for the good form
                                                                      "              "
of a " set," and to divert the current of youthful enthusiasm into an
undue sense of the importance of boot-varnish.               I maintain that such
surroundings,     and  the  influences   of a too prosperous society, may tend
to hinder rather than to foster the growth of this sensitive plant,
which will often flourish in the rude winds of adversity and perish in
 the scent-laden salons of fashion.          To argue that the artist should
 shut himself off from the world, and wrap himself round with a
mantle of dignified ignorance, would of course be absurd.                     I  have
already   said   that   a  knowledge     of   men   and   things    is  essential   to
him,   and   this  knowledge      is  manifestly impossible       unless   he   is  in
 sympathetic touch with his generation, for we cannot give out what
we have not taken in. His should be the bird's-eye view.                     But the
allurements     of society    should   never  be  allowed    to absorb    or enslave
him — lest in sipping its enervating narcotic he should drift from
the broad stream of life into the backwater of self-indulgence.                   The
 poet, like  the  soldier,  may
                                  "  caper nimbly    in a  lady's  chamber     to  the
lascivious pleasing      of a lute,"  but if  he  dances   a  too frequent    attend
ance in the antechamber of fashion, the jealous muse deserts him,
and the poet's song henceforth finds utterance in the lisping treble
of the " vers de SociStS," and a fitful inspiration in the chronicling of
an illustrious birth or a serene demise. It takes a genius to sur
vive being made Poet-Laureate — indeed this official reward might
often be conferred only on the poet when he is dead, to benefit his
family and to point out the beauties of his works to an otherwise
indifferent posterity.
     Of all the fetters which cramp the imagination, none is so frequent
as self-consciousness.        With many of us this failing becomes a dis
ease.    The actor is more liable to its attacks than any other artist,
since he cannot separate his personality from his work.                 This is the

  1893.]                  on the, Imaginative Faculty.                    123
 necessary condition under which he works ; he cannot, like the poet
 or the painter, choose his mood — he is the slave of the moment.
 Under what disadvantages would a painter work if his patron were
standing at his elbow watching each stroke of his brush.
     It is only when the mind of the actor is emancipated from the
trammels of his surroundings that his imagination is allowed full
play. The nervousness which afflicts him in his first performance of
a new role will often paralyse his imagination ; though it is true that
the dependence on this imaginative faculty varies in individuals. . . .
     I have endeavoured to show how the imaginative faculty in acting
may be cramped by self-consciousness, and how susceptible it is to
social and other influences which surround the life of the artist. In
the same way it is also susceptible of infinite cultivation if left to its
own devices.     I  am willing to admit that every artist works according
to his own method ; but      I  maintain that that art is likely to produce
the greatest effect which is least reliant on what are called the canons
of art, that is to say, that art which springs spontaneously from the
yielding up of the artist to his imagination.          I have known actors
who frequently arrive at many of their best effects through patient
study ; indeed,    I believe, great actors have been known to study each
gesture before a looking-glass.         This seems to me, nevertheless, a
mistaken system, and one certainly which would be destructive to the
effects of those who prefer to rely on the mood of the moment.
Another aspect of our art which has of late been much debated is,
whether it is desirable that the actor should or should not sink his
individuality in the part he is playing ; whether, in fact, the actor
 should be absorbed in his work, or the work be absorbed in the actor.
 It seems to me, in spite of all that certain writers are never tired of
 dinning into our ears, that the higher aim of the artist is to so project
 his imagination into the character he is playing that his own indi
 viduality becomes merged in his assumption.           This indeed seems to
 me the very essence of the art of acting.        I remember that when        I
 first went upon the stage,        I was told that to obtain any popular
 success, an actor must be always himself, that the public even like to
 recognise the familiar voice before he appears on the scene, that he
 should, if possible, confine himself to what was called "one line of
 business," and that he should seek to cultivate a certain mannerism
 whinh should be the badge of his individuality.         It seems to me that
 this is an entirely erroneous and mischievous doctrine            Indeed,    I
 will go so far as to maintain that the highest expression in every
 branch of art has always been the impersonal.            The groatest'artist
 that ever lived was the most impersonal, he was the most impersonal
 because the most imaginative.       I mean our own Shakespeare. Where
 do we find him in his work ? The spirit, the style everywhere — but
 the man ? nowhere — except in the sense le ttyle e'ett Vhomme.         Tako
 ' Othello,'
             for instance, the finest perhaps of all his stage-plays.       If
 we think we have found him in the noble outbursts of the Moor, in
the over-mastering passion of the simple-minded warrior, we lose him

 124                    Mr. Herbert Beerbohm Tree                 [May   26,
 immediately in the intellectual sympathy which he seems to lavish
 on the brutal cynicism of the subtle and brilliant Iago.            In one
moment he soars to the very heights of poetic ecstasy, in the next he
descends with equal ease and apparent zest into the depths of sottish
animalism.     We find him in the melodious wail of Hamlet, we lose
him in the hoggish grunts of Falstaff.        What sort of a man Shake
speare was we none of us know.          We are led to believe that he was
aa excellent business man, with a taste for agriculture. In his work
he becomes effaced — his spirit is like a Will-o'-the-wisp.       His mind
is like the Irishman's flea — " you no sooner put your finger upon him,
but he isn't there."     His was essentially a plastic mind — he was
capable of entering into the thoughts of all men, and made their
point of view his own.      Nowhere did he insist on his personal pre
dilections — he was, in fact, the artist — the creator — he looked upon
mankind with all the impartiality of a god, he laid their hearts bare
with the imperturbability of an inspired vivisectionist.       The abiding
                                      '
hold which the play of ' Hamlet has exercised over so many suc
cessive generations is mainly due to its wondrous mystery which
holds the imagination of an audience enthralled, for, in the conven
 tional sense, it cannot be said to be a pattern stage-play.     In what a
masterful fashion is the key-note of mystery struck in the very first
scene on the ramparts ; from the moment when the solitary soldier
calls through the night, " Who's there ? " the imagination of the
audience is held spellbound ; with such marvellous power is it played
upon by the dramatist that from the first scene a modern sceptical
audience accepts the supernatural basis of the play.        Probably more
inspired nonsense has been written on the subject of ' Hamlet by the
                                                                   '
unimaginative commentator than on any subject within the scope of
literature.   Yet to him who will approach Shakespeare's masterpiece
in the right spirit, it will be seen to have that simplicity which is
characteristic of all great works.      The finest poems which have ever
been penned, the greatest pictures which have ever been painted, the
greatest inventions which have been given to the world have been
distinguished by this quality of simplicity.      I have noticed this same
characteristic in great men.     It is only when we do not yield our
selves up to our imagination that the simple appears incomprehensible.
Nearly all the mad doctors have diagnosed Hamlet's case, and nearly
all claim him as their own. This is the tendency of the specialist.
                          I
It is rather a question, think, as to the sanity of Hamlet's commen
tators. An astounding instance of this super-subtlety — (in itself a
symptom of madness) — is shown in the comments of some of the
German critics. One of these gravely informs us that the passage,
" You know sometimes he walks for hours here in the lobby," proves
beyond a doubt that Hamlet was really a fat man, for, in order to
reduce his obesity, he took four hours' regular exercise in the lobby ;
but, perhaps, our German friend was a specialist in Banting.      Another
critic, Leo by name, supplies a still more marvellous instance of
painstaking misunderstanding       of the obvious in his elucidation of

1893.]                   em  the Imaginative   Faculty.                       125
Hamlet's hysterical outburst at the conclusion of the play-scene.               In
this, some actors use the words peacock, and others pajock, signifying
toad. But our critic throws a new light upon the passage which may
commend itself to some realistic Hamlet of the future.              The word in
                    Leo,            "
                           really hiccup,"     which   was  intended   as a stage
dispute was, says
direction.     Our genial   critic  argues  that  Hamlet   intended   to call the
King    an ass, and ass certainly rhymes      with  " was."     The  passage, he
contends, should read thus       : —
                     " For thou dost know, oh Damon dear,
                       This realm dismantled was
                       Of Jove himself, and now reigns here
                       A very — very — (hiccup$)."
Hamlet's indignation is apparently too deep for words — the very
height of tragic emotion finds expression in a hiccup ! The unima-
ginativeness of the critic is in this case absolutely monumental.              In
'            '
  Macheth we have another instance of the astounding imaginative
ness of Shakespeare.       The test of the greatness of a work is that it is
not only great in itself, but that it is the cause of greatness in others.
A very striking instance of this suggestive fecundity of the poet was
told me of Mrs. Siddons in her playing the sleep-walking scene.                At
the words " All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little
hand," the conscience-stricken woman sees with her mind's eye a
stain upon her hand, and, raising it to her mouth, desperately sucks
the imaginary blood from it, spitting it out as she does so.                 The
daring of this piece of realism, which might strike the common-place
as vulgar, was in reality a stroke of imaginative genius, and,              I  am
told, produced an electrical effect npon the audience. In dramatic
literature that work is highest which is most suggestive, which gives
to the artist as to the spectator most opportunities of weaving round
the work of the poet the embroidery of his own imagination.                   If I
may instance a modern play,           I should say that this quality is dis
                                                                  '
played in an eminent degree in Ibsen's latest work,                 The Master
Builder.' We know that this play is condemned by some as a flagrant
outrage of conventional form, while others dismiss it as a common
place presentation of a commonplace theme.               I  must confess that,
judged by Ibsen's plays, Scandinavia, in its sordid Suburbanism,
seems to me an undesirable abiding-place.             All the more wonderful
is it that the magician should have been able to conjure up from this
dank soil, which would appear congenial only to mushroom-growths,
 such wondrous and variegated plants.            In witnessing this play we
 are moved by its power, we are fascinated by its originality.               Few
 fail to feel the thud of its pulse. Each weaves his own version of its
 message.     The master has gained his end ; he has stirred the imagina
 tion of his audience ; he alone remains sphinx-like, unexplained ; he
 is the artist — wise master !
      In using Shakespeare as an illustration of the highest develop
 ment of the imaginative artist, and in claiming for his work that

126                    Mr. Herbert   Beerbohm   Tree              [May  26,
impersonality    which  I  hold to be the distinguished mark of his
genius,   I am far from denying that many of our greatest writers,
many of our greatest painters and actors, have been those whose
personality is most resonant in their work, but            I say that the
intrusion of that personality is not the merit of their work, but rather
its limitation. No doubt a more easily won popularity is awarded
by that large public which demands an exhibition of individuality
rather than of characterisation, of personality rather than of imper
sonation ; yet it is better to strive for the higher, even if we miss it,
than to clutch at the lower, even if it is within easy reach. The
adroit actor should be able at will to adapt his individuality to the
character he is pourtraying.     By the aid of his imagination, he
becomes the man, and behaves unconsciously as the man would or
should behave; this he does instinctively rather than from any
conscious study, for what does not come spontaneously may as well
not come at all.    Even the physical man will appear transformed.
If he imagines himself a tall man, he will appear so to the audience —
how often have we not heard people exclaim that an orator appeared
to grow in height as his speech became eloquent ?             If the actor
imagines himself a fat man, he will appear fat to the spectator.
There is a kind of artistic conspiracy between the actor and hia
audience. It is not the outer covering, which is called the " make
up," which causes this impression, it is the inner man — who talks fat,
walks fat, and thinks fat. As in the planet, it is only when the in
ternal fire ceases that the body becomes hardened and unpliable.
The actor, even though he be peasant born, will be able by the power
of his imagination to acquire the rare gift of distinction.     He will be
able, by the aid of his imagination, to become a king — that is to say,
not the accidental king, who in actual life may lack dignity, but the
king of our imagination.      In this connection it is on record that
Napoleon the First once administered a rebuke to Talma, with whom
he had a dramatic affinity.    The actor, it seems, in playing a Roman
emperor, used violent gestures.       Napoleon, criticising this exuber
ance, said, " Why use these unnecessary flourishes ? — When 1 give an
order,  I require nothing to enforce it —my word is enough.         This is
no way to behave as an emperor."         The first Napoleon was a great
actor — and his dramatic instinct was not the least formidable among
those qualities which made him such a power in the world's history.
As on the stage, so it is in real life, we are not what we are, we
become what we imagine ourselves to be.         A man is not always what
he appears to his valet.    He often finds his truest expression in his
work. A great man will often appear uninteresting and common
place in real life. Who has not felt that disappointment ? The real
man is to be found in his work.      It is this personality which is often
obliterated by his biographer — for detraction is the only tribute
which mediocrity can pay to the great. This literary autopsy adds a
new terror to death. A man might at least be permitted to leave his
reputation to his critics, as he would leave his brains to a hospital.

Bat   I am   forgetting Napoleon — he was able to imagine himself an
 emperor, and, circumstances conspiring with him, he became one.
 His enemies thought they were belittling him by calling him an
 actor, and the Pope, whom he hurled from the Papal throne, could

 only retort " Comediante       ; but the comedian continued to play his
 part of emperor while the Pope was in exile.          The artistic methods
 of the first Napoleon are brought into strong relief when contrasted
 with those of his less imaginative nephew. Indeed, the difference
between the imaginative and the unimaginative actor is well ex
emplified in these two.        Had Napoleon the Third possessed the true
dramatic instinct, he would not have been guilty of the Boulogne
fiasco.   On that occasion, in order to impress the populace with a
 supernatural significance of his mission, he had recourse to the stagey
device of a tame eagle, which, as the emblem of empire, was at a
given cue to alight upon him. But the bird, which had been trained
to perch upon his top-hat, disdained his crown.            Here we have an
illustration of the futility of unimaginative stage-management.
     The imagination is the mind's eye.         To him who has it not, life
presents itself ao a picture possessing all the merits of a photograph,
 and none of the blemishes of a work of art.              He who does not
 treasure it,  will lose its use.   In burst of scientific fantasy, once
                                     a                             I

will the imagination, this third eye of the mind, looking heavenward,
lose its function unless  it   is exercised.    The waning of the imagina
tion is, next to the loss of his childish faith, the most tragic thing in
a man's life.   I    can conceive no fate more terrible than that which
befalls the artist in watching with still undiminished powers of self-
observation, the slow ebbing of the imaginative faculty, to see           it
drifting out to sea in the twilight of life.         Better be deprived of
sight than to feel that the world has lost its beauty — for the blind
are happier than the blear-eyed. .   .   .

currents springing from one parent source.          The greatest victories
which mind has achieved over matter have been due to the soaring
flights of the imagination rather than to a mere crawling research
along the surface of facts.        This hall, where Faraday, Huxley, and
Tyndall    have  spoken,  has  witnessed displays of the imagination equal
to those of the highest poetry.      As the diver dives for pearls into the
depths of the sea, so does science project itself on the wings of the
imagination     into the mists which shroud the vast unexplained,
snatching    in its flight the secrets which solve the mysteries of the
universe, and which point out to mankind the invisible stepping-
stones connecting the known with the unknown.
     It was in this hall that Professor Dewar summoned the elusive
and invisible atmosphere, which since all time has enveloped the
earth, and with the wand of science compelled it to appear before
you in a palpable and visible form.         Even so does the imagination
distil from the elemental ether of thought and truth the liquid air of
art.     I have endeavoured to show that, just as the highest achieve
ment of science is that which we owe to the imagination, so also is
the highest achievement of art that which carries us out of the sordid
surroundings of every-day life into the realms of idealised truth.       Its
 loftiest mission is to preserve for us, amid the din and clash of life,
 those illusions which are its better part — to epitomise for us the as
 pirations of mankind, to stifle its sobs, to nurse its wounds, to requite
 its unrequited love, to sing its lullaby of death. It is the unwept
 tear of the criminal, it is the ode of the agnostic to immortality, it is
 the toy of childhood, the fairyland of the mature, and gilds old age
 with the afterglow of youth.

         Study   of Fluid Motion      by means     of Coloured Bands.
In his                        '
         charming story of < The Purloined Letter,' Edgar Allan Poe
tells how all the efforts and artifices of the Paris police to obtain
 possession of a certain letter, known to be in a particular room, were
completely baffled for months by the simple plan of leaving the
letter in an unsealed envelope in a letter-rack, and so destroying all
curiosity as to its contents ; and how the letter was at last found there
by a young man who was not a professional member of the force.
Closely analogous to this is the story           I have to set before you to
night—how      certain  mysteries  of  fluid  motion,  which have resisted all
attempts    to  penetrate  them    are   at  last  explained by the simplest
means and in the most obvious manner.
     This indeed is no new story in science. The method adopted by
the minister, D., to secrete his letter appears to be the favourite of
Nature in keeping her secrets, and the history of science teems with
instances in which keys, after being long sought amongst the grander
phenomena, have been found at last not hidden with care, but
scattered about, almost openly, in the most commonplace incidents of
every-day life which have excited no curiosity.
                                                               I
     This was the case in physical astronomy — to which shall return
after having reminded you that the motion of matter in the universe
naturally divides itself into three classes.
     1. The motion of bodies as a whole — as a grand illustration oi
which we have the heavenly bodies, or more humble, but not less
effective, the motion of a pendulum, or a falling body.
     2. The relative motion of the different parts of the same fluid or
elastic body — for the illustration of which we may go to the grand
phenomena presented by the tide, the whirlwind, or the transmission
of sound, but which is equally well illustrated by the oscillatory
motion of the wave, as shown by the motion of its surface, and
by the motion of this jelly, which, although the most homely illus
tration, affords by far the best illustration of the properties of an
elastic solid.
     3. The inter-motions of a number of bodies amongst each other
—to which class belong the motions of the molecules of matter

resulting from heat, as the motions of the molecules of a gas, in
illustration of which  I  may mention the motions of individuals in a
crowd, and illustrate by the motion of the grains in this bottle when it
is shaken, during which the white grains at the top gradually mingle
with the black ones at the bottom — which interdiffusion takes an
important part in the method of coloured bands.
     Now of these three classes of motion that of the individual body
is incomparably the simplest.      Yet, as presented in the phenomena of
the heavens, which have ever excited the greatest curiosity of mankind,
 it defied the attempts of all philosophers for thousands of years, until
 Galileo discovered the laws of motion of mundane matter. It was
 not until he had done this and applied these laws to the heavenly
 bodies that their motions received a rational explanation.         Then
 Newton, taking up Galileo's parable and completing          it,
                                                            found that its
 strict application to the heavenly bodies revealed the law of gravi
 tation, and developed the theory of dynamics.
     Next to the motions of the heavenly bodies, the wave, the whirl
 winds, and the motions of clouds, had excited the philosophical
 curiosity of mankind from the earliest time. Both Galileo and
 Newton, as well as their followers, attempted to explain these by the
 laws of motion, but although the results so obtained have been of the
 utmost importance in the development of the theory of dynamics                  it
 was not till this century that any considerable advance was made in
 the application of this theory to the explanation of fluid phenomena,
 and although during the last fifty years splendid work has been done,
 work which, in respect of the mental effort involved, or the scientific
 importance of the results, goes beyond that which resulted in the
 discovery of Neptune, yet the circumstances of fluid motion are so
 obscure and complex that the theory has yet been interpreted only in
the simplest cases.
    To illustrate the difference between the interpretation of the
theory of the heavenly bodies and that of fluid motion,          would call
                                                                   I
your attention to the fact that solid bodies, on the behaviour of which
the theory of the motion of the planets      founded, move as one piece,

so that their motion       exactly represented by the motion of their
                           is
surfaces that they are not affected with any internal disorder which
           ;
may affect their general motion.     So surely     this the case, that even
                                                       is

how any ordinary body will behave under any ordinary circumstances,

internal motion. Of what sort ? Well, I think my illustration may
                           I                                   I
carry more weight if do not tell you ; you can all, have no doubt,
form a good idea. It is not fluid motion or                I
                                               should feel bound to
explain it. You have here an ordinary looking object which behaves
in an extraordinary manner, which is yet very decided and clear, to
judge by the motion of its surface, and from the manner of the
             I
motion wish you to judge of the cause of the observed motion.
     This is the problem presented by fluids, in which there may be
 internal motion which has to be taken into account before the motion
 of the surface can be explained. You can see no more of what the
 motion is within a homogeneous fluid, however opaque or clear, than
 you can see what is going on within the box. Thus, without colour
 bands the only visual clue to what is going on within the fluids is
the motion of their bounding surfaces. Nor is this all ; in most cases
the surfaces which bound the fluid are immovable.
     In the case of the wave on water the motion of the surface shows
that there is motion, but because the surface shows no wave it does
 not do to infer that the fluid is at rest.
     The only surfaces of the air within this room are the surfaces of
the floor, walls, and objects within it. By moving the objects we
move the air, but how far the air is at rest you cannot tell unless it
is something familiar to you.
                 I
     Now will ask you to look at these balloons. They are familiar
objects enough, and yet they are most sensitive anemometers, more
sensitive than anything else in the room ; but even they do not show
any motion ; each of them forms an internal bounding surface of the
air.     Isend an aerial messenger to them, and a small but energetic
motion   is  seen by which it acknowledges the message, and the same
message    travels    through the rest, as if a ghost touched them. It is
a wave that moves them.          You do not feel     it,and, but for the surfaces
of the air formed by the balloons, would have no notion of its
existence.
     In this tank of beautifully clear distilled water, project heavy
                                                               I             a
ball in from the end, and         it   shows the existence of the water by
stopping    almost     dead  within   two  feet.     The fact that it    stopped
                                                                        is
by the   watei,    being  familiar, docs  not  raise  the question, Why does      it
stop —
     ?       aquestion to which, even at the present day,           a   complete
answer       not
             is    forthcoming.     The question is, however, suggested, and
forcibly suggested, when        it  appears that with no greater or other
evidence    of   its  existence,
                               I     can project a     disturbance through the
water which      will  drive this small   disc   the  whole length of the tank.
 I    have now shown instances of fluid motion of which the manner
isin no way evident without colour bands, and were revealed by colour
bands, as    showed in this room sixteen years ago.
             I                                         At that time was      I
occupied  in  setting before you   the  manners of motion revealed, and           ]
could only incidentally     notice   the means  by  which this revelation
was accomplished.

     Amongst the ordinary pLenomena of motion there are many
 which render evident the internal motion of fluids.            Small objects
 suspended in the fluid are important, and that their importance has
 long been recognised is shown by the proverb — straws show which
 way the wind blows.        Bubbles in water, smoke and clouds, afford the
most striking phenomena, and it is doubtless these that have furnished
philosophers with such clues as they have had. But the indications
furnished by these phenomena are imperfect, and, what is more im
portant, they only occur casually, and in general only under circum
stances of such extreme complexity that any deduction as to the
elementary motions involved is impossible.          They afford indication
of commotion, and perhaps of the general direction in which the com
motion is tending, but this is about all.
     For example, the different types of clouds ; these have always been
noticed and are all named. And it is certain that each type of clouds
is an indication of a particular type of motion in the air ; but no
deductions as to what definite manner of motion is indicated by each
type of cloud have ever been published.
     Before this can be done it is necessary to reverse the problem,
and find to what particular type of cloud a particular manner of
motion would give rise.        Now a cloud, as we see         it,
                                                             does not directly
indicate the internal motion of which     it   isthe result.   As we look at
clouds, it   is   not in general their motion that we notice, but their
figure.     It is   hard to see that this figure changes while we are
watching  a    cloud, though such a    change  is continually going on, but
is apparently very slow on account of the great distance of the cloud
and its great size.      However, types of clouds are determined by their
figure, not by their motion.         Now what their figure shows           not
                                                                             is
motion, but   is  the history or result of the motion of particular strata of
the air in and through surrounding strata. Hence, to interpret the
figures of the clouds we must study the changes in shape of fluid
masses, surrounded by fluid, which result from particular motions.
     The ideal in the method of colour bands            to render streaks or
                                                         is
lines in definite position in the fluid visible, without in any way
otherwise interfering with these properties as part of the homogeneous
fluid. If we could by      a     wish create coloured lines in the water
these would be ideal colour bands. We cannot do this, nor can we
exactly paint lines in the air or water.
       take this ladle full of highly coloured water, lower        slowly into
                                                                    is it

the surface of the surrounding water till that within               level with
that without  ;    then turn the ladle carefully round the coloured water           ;
the mass of coloured water will remain where placed.
 I     distribute the colour slowly.      It does not mix with the clear
water, and although the lines are irregular they stand out very beauti
fully.    Their edges are sharp here. But in this large sphere, which
was coloured before the lecture, although the coloured lines have
generally kept their places, they have, as           were, swollen out and

 motion.    The sphere shows, however, one of the rarest phenomena in
 Nature— the internal state in almost absolute internal rest. The
 forms resemble nothing so much as stratus clouds, as seen on a summer
 day, though the continuity of the colour bands is more marked.            A
 mass of coloured water once introduced is never broken.         The discon
 tinuity of clouds is thus seen to be due to other causes than mere
 motion.
     Now, having called your attention to the rarity of water at rest,      I
 will call your attention to what is apt to be  a very striking phenomenon,
namely, that when water is contained, like this, in a spherical vessel of
which you cannot alter the shape, it is impossible by moving the
vessel suddenly to set up relative motion in the interior of the water.
I  may swing this vessel about and turn it, but the colour band in the
middle remains as it was, and when        I  stop shows the water to be at
rest.
     This is not so if the water has a free surface, or if the fluid is
of unequal density. Then a motion of the vessel sets up waves,
and the colour band shows at once the beautifully lawful character
of the internal motion. The colour bands move backwards and
forwards, showing how the water is distorted like a jelly, and as the
wave dies out the colour bands remain as they were to begin with.
     This illustrates one of the two classes of internal motion of water
or fluid. Wherever fluid is not in contact with surfaces over which
it has to glide, or which surfaces fold on themselves, the internal
motions are of this purely wave character.          The colour bands, how
ever much they may be distorted, cannot be relatively displaced,
twisted, or curled up, and in this case motion in water once set up
continues almost without resistance.          That wave motion in water
with a free surface, is one of the most difficult things to stop is
directly connected with the difficulty of setting still water in motion ;
in either case the influence must come through the surfaces. Thus it is
that waves once set up will traverse thousands of miles, establishing
communication between the shores of Europe and America.               Wave
motion in water is subject to enormously less resistance than any
other form of material motion.
     In wave motion, if the colour bands are across the wave they
show the motion of the water ; nevertheless, their chief indication is
of the change of shape while the fluid is in motion.
     This is illustrated in this long bottle, with the coloured water
less heavy than the clear water.       If I   lay it down in order to es
tablish equilibrium, the blue water has to leavo the upper end of the
bottle and spread itself over the clear water, while the clear water
runs under the coloured. This sets up wave motion, which continues
after the bottle has come to rest. But as the colour bands are parallel
with the direction of motion of the waves, the motion only becomes
evident in thickening and bending of the colour bands.
    The waves are entirely between the two fluids, there being no
motion in the outer surfaces of the bottle, which is everywhere glass.

134                        Professor Osfcorne Reynolds                        [June 2,
They are owing to the slight differences in the density of the fluids,
as is indicated by the extreme slowness of the motion.                         Of such
kind are the waves in the air, that cause the clouds which make the
mackerel sky, the vapour in the tops of the waves being condensed
and evaporated again as it descends, showing the results of the
motion.
     The distortional        motions, such as alone occur in simple wave
motion, or    where     the surfaces      of the fluid do not fold in on themselves,
or wind     in,   are  the   same     as    occur in any homogeneous continuous
material which completely             fills  the space between the surfaces.
     If  plastic   material     is  homogeneous in colour it shows nothing as
to the internal      motion   ;   but   if 1 take a lump built of plates, blue and
white, say      a  square,   then     I   can change the surfaces to any shape
without folding       or  turning      the   lump, and the coloured bands which
extend throughout          the    lump     show   the internal changes.      Now the
first point to    illustrate     is that,   however   I  change its  shape, if I bring
it back to the original shape the colour bands will all come back to
their original positions, and there is no limit to the extent of the
change that may thus be effected.                I  may roll this out to any length,
or   draw  it out,   and   the    diminution     in  thickness of the colour bands
shows the extent of the distortion.                 This is the first and simplest
class of motion to which fluids are susceptible.                By this motion alone
 the elements      of the  fluid    may    be, and  are, drawn  out  to an indefinitely
fine line, or spread out in an indefinitely thin sheet, but they will
remain of the same general figure.
      By reversing the process they change back again to the original
 form.    No colour band can ever be broken, even if the outer surface
 be punched in till the punch head comes down on the table ; still all
 the colour bands are continuous under the punch, and there is no
folding or lapping of the colour bands unless the external surface is
 folded.
      The general idea of mixture is so familiar to us that the vast
 generalisation to which these ideas afford the key, remains un
 noticed.      That continued mixing results in uniformity, and that
 uniformity is only to be obtained by mixing, will be generally
 acknowledged, but how deeply and universally this enters into all
 the arts can but rarely have been apprehended.                     Does it ever occur
 to any one that the beautiful uniformity of our textile fabrics
 has only been obtained by the development of processes of mixing
 the fibres. Or, again, the uniformity in our construction of metals ;
 has it ever occurred to any one that the inventions of Arkwright
 and Cort were but the application of the long-known processes by
 which mixing is effected in culinary operations ? Arkwright applied
  the draw-rollers to uniformly extend the length of the cotton sliver
 at the expense of the thickness ; Cort applied the rolling-mill to
 extend the length of the iron bloom at the expense of its breadth ;
 but who invented the rolling-pin by which the pastry-cook extends the
 length at the expense of the thickness of the dough for the pie-crust ?

1893.]   on Study    of Fluid Motion   by meant   of Coloured Bands.          135
     In all these processes the object, too, is the same throughout — to
obtain some particular shape, but chiefly to obtain a uniform texture.
To obtain this nicety of texture it is necessary to mix up the material,
and to accomplish this it is necessary to attenuate the material, so
that the different parts may be brought together.
     The readiness with which fluids are mixed and uniformity ob
tained is a by-word ; but it is only when we come to see the colour
bands that we realise that the process by which this is attained is
essentially the same as that so laboriously discovered for the arts — as
depending first on the attenuation of each element of the fluid —as             I
have illustrated by distortion.
    In fluids, no less than in cooking, spinning and rolling — this
attenuation is only the first step in the process of mixing — all involve
the second process, that of folding, piling, or wrapping, by which
the attenuated layers are brought together.        This does not occur in
the pure wave motion of water, and constitutes the second of the
two classes of motion.        If
                             a wave on water is driven beyond a certain
height it leaps or breaks, folding in its surface.           Or, if       I
                                                                         but
move a solid surface through the water it introduces tangential
motion, which enables the fluid to wind its elements round an axis.
In these ways, and only in these ways, we are released from the re
striction of not turning or lapping.     And in our illustration, we may
fold up our dough, or lap it — roll it out again and lap it again ; cut
up our iron bar, pile   it,and rollit  out again, or bring as many as wo
please of the attenuated fibres of cotton together to be further drawn.
It may be thought that this attenuation and wrapping will never
make perfect admixture, for however thin each element will
preserve its characteristic, the coloured layers will be there, however
often
    I     double and roll out the dough.        This  istrue.   But in the
case of some fluids, and only in the case of some fluids, the physi
cal process of diffusion completes the admixture.            These colour
bands have remained in this water, swelling but still distinct          this
                                                                          ;
shows the slowness of diffusion.         Yet such     is the facility with
which the fluid will go through the process of attenuating its
elements and enfolding them, that by simply stirring with            spoon
                                                                      a
these colour bands can be drawn and folded so fine that the diffu
sion will be instantaneous, and the fluid become uniformly tinted.
All internal fluid motion other than simple distortion, as in wave
motion,        process of mixing, and         thus from the arts we get
         isa
                                        it
                                        is
the clue to the elementary forms and processes of fluid motion.
    When I    put the spoon in and mixed the fluid you could not see
what went on —  it  was too quick.   To make this clear,    it   is
                                                                 necessary
that the motion should be very slow.        The motion should also be
in planes, at right angles to the direction in which you are looking.
Such is the instability of fluid that to accomplish this at first
appeared to be difficult.     At last, however, as the result of much
thought. I   found a simple process which    I    will now show you, in
whatI    think is   anovel experiment, and you will see, what         think
                                                                      I

136                    Professor Osborne Reynolds                  [June   2,
  has never been seen before by any one but Mr. Foster and myself,
  namely, the complete process of the formation of a cylindrical vortex
  sheet resulting from the motion of a solid surface.           To make it
               I
  visible to all am obliged to limit the colour band to one section
  of the sheet, otherwise only those immediately in front would be
  able to see between the convolutions of the spiral. But you will
  understand that what is seen is a section, a similar state of motion
  extending right across the tank.     From the surface you see the plane
  vane extending half-way down right across the tank ; this is attached
 to a float.
      I now institute a colour band on the right of the vane out of the
  tube.   There is no motion in the water, and the colour descends slowly
 from the tube.    I   now give a small impulse to the float to move it
 to the right, and at once the spiral form is seen from the tube.    Similar
 spirals would be formed all across the tank if there were colours.
 The float has moved out of the way, leaving the revolving spiral with
 its centre stationary, showing the horizontal axis of the spiral is
 half-way between the bottom and surface of the tank, in which the
 water is now simply revolving round this axis.
      This is the vortex in its simplest and rarest form (for a vortex
 cannot exist with its ends exposed). Like an army it must have its
 flanks protected ; hence a straight vortex can only exist where it has
 two surfaces to cover its flanks, and parallel vertical surfaces are
 not common in nature.       The vortex can bend, and, as with a horse
 shoe axis, can rest both its flanks on the same surface, as this piece
 of clay, or with a ring axis, which is its commonest form, as in the
 smoke ring.      In both these cases the vortex will be in motion
 through the fluid, and less easy to observe.
      These vortices have no motion beyond the rotation because they
are half-way down the tank.       If    the vane were shorter they would
 follow the vane ; if it were longer they would leave it.
      In the same way, if instead of one vortex there were two vortices,
 with their axes parallel, extending right across, the one above another,
they would move together along the tank.
      I replace the float by another which has a vane suspended from
it, so that the water can pass both above and below the vane extending
right across the middle portion of the tank. In this case institute
                                                               I
two colour bands, one to pass over the top, the other underneath, the
vane, which colour bands will render visible     a   section of each vortex
just as in the last case.I     now set the float in motion and the two
vortices turn towards each other in opposite directions.          They are
formed by the water moving over the surface of the vane, downwards
to get under it, upwards to get over       it, so that the rotation in the
upper vortex  is   opposite to that in the lower. All thisis  just the same
as before, but that instead of these vortices standing still as before they
follow at a definite distance from the vane, which continues its motion
along the tank without resistance.
     Now this experiment shows, in the simplest form, the modus

  1893.]    on Study  of Fluid Motion  by means  of Coloured Bands.     137
  operandi   by which internal waves can exist in fluid without any
  motion in the external boundary.         Not only is this plate moving
  flatwise through the water, but it is followed by all the water,
 coloured and nncolonred, enclosed in these cylindrical vortices.
 Now, although there is no absolute surface visible, yet there is
 a definite     surface which encloses these moving           vortices, and
 separates them from the water which moves out of their way.
This surface will be rendered visible in another experiment                I
shall show you.         Thus the water which has only wave motion
 is bounded by a definite surface, the motion of which corresponds
to the wave; but inside this closed surface there is also water,
so that we cannot see the surface, and this water inside is moving
round and round, but so that its motion at the bounding surface is
everywhere the same as that of the outside water.
      The two masses of water do not mix. That outside moves out
of the way of and past the vortices over the bounding surface, while
the vortices move round and round inside the surface in such a way
that it is moving in exactly the same manner at the surface as the
 wave surface outside.
      This is the key to the internal motion of water. You cannot have
 a pure wave motion inside a mass of fluid with its boundaries at
 rest, but you have a compound motion, a wave motion outside, and a
 vortex within, which fulfils the condition that there shall be no sliding
 of the fluid over fluid at the boundary.
                        I
      A means which hope may make the essential conditions of this
 motion clearer occurred to me while preparing this lecture, and to this   I
 will now ask your attention.     I have here a number of layers of cotton
 wool (wadding). Now I can force any body along between these layers
 of wadding.      They yield, as by a wave, and let it go through ; but the
 wadding must slide over the surface of the body so moving through
 it.    And this it must not do if it illustrate the conditions of fluid
 motion.     Now there is one way, and only one way, in which material
 can be got through between the sheets of wadding without slipping.
 It must roll through ; but this is not enough, because if it rolls on
 the under surface it will be slipping on the upper.        But if we have
two rollers, one on the top of the other, between the sheets, then the
lower roller rolls on the bottom sheet, the upper roller rolls against
the upper sheet, so that there is no slipping between the rollers or
the wadding, and, equally important, there is no slipping between the
rollers, as they roll on each other.      I have only to place a sheet of
canvas between the rollers and draw it through ; both the flannel
rollers roll on the canvas and on the wadding, which they pass
through without slipping, causing the wadding to move in a wave
outside them, and affording a complete parable of the vortex motion.
      I  will now show by colour bands some of the more striking
phenomena of internal motion, as presented by Nature's favourite
form of vortex, the vortex ring, which may be described as two
horseshoe vortices with their ends founded on each other.

138                Professor Reynolds on    Fluid Motion.        [June   2,
     To show the surface separating the water moving with the vortex
from that which gives way outside,        I  discharge from this orifice a
mass of coloured water, which has a vortex ring in it formed by the
surface as already described.     You see the beautifully defined mass
moving    on   slowly through   the  fluid, with the proper vortex ring
motion, but very slow.       It will not go far before a change takes
place, owing to the diffusion of the vortex motion across the bounding
surface ; then the coloured surface will be wound into the ring which
will appear. The mass approaches the disc in front. It cannot pass, but
will come up and carry the disc forward ; but the disc, although it does
not destroy the ring, disturbs the motion.
     If I  send a more energetic ring it will explain the phenomenon
I   showed you at the beginning of this lecture ; it carries the disc
forward as if struck with a hammer.          This blow is not simply the
weight of the coloured ring,    but of   the  whole moving mass and the
wave outside.      The ring cannot pass the disc without destruction
with the attendant wave.
     Not only can a ring follow a disc, but as with the plane vane so
with the disc, if we start a disc we must start a ring behind it.
     I  will now fulfil my promise to reveal the silent messenger         I
sent to those balloons.     The messenger appears in the form of a large
smoke ring, which is a vortex ring in air rendered visible by smoke
instead of colour.     The origination of these rings has been carefully
set so that the balloons are beyond the surface which separates the
moving mass of water from the wave, so that they are subject to the
 wave motion only.      If they are within this surface they will disturb
 the direction of the ring, if they do not break it up.
      These are, if  I may say so, the phenomenal instances of internal
 motion of fluids. Phenomenal in their simplicity they are of intense
 interest, like the pendulum, as furnishing the clue to the more complex.
 It is by the light we gather from their study that we can hope to
 interpret the parable of the vortex wrapped up in the wave, as applied
 to the wind of heaven, and the grand phenomenon of the clouds, as
 well as those things which directly concern us, such as the resistance
of our ships.

                           The Recent Solar Eclipse.*
Most people who take any interest in             those larger problems with
which   men    of science are nowadays concerned are aware that there
are certain questions relating to the chemistry and physics of the sun
which, at present, can only be solved by observations made during the
fleeting moments of the total phase of a solar eclipse.           Thanks to the
action of the Nautical Almanac office in this country, and of similar
institutions in other countries, we have not only ample warning of
the advent of an eclipse of the sun, but we are furnished with such
details concerning the time of its occurrence, the direction of the path
of the moon's shadow on the earth, and the duration of the various
phases, that we are enabled to decide whether it is expedient to at
tempt to seize the precious seconds during which the sun is obscured
by the moon, in order to get further light on those questions which,
as has been said, can only be at present solved, or at least studied, at
such times.
     During the eclipse of last April the moon's shadow swept over
a considerable     expanse of land.       It touched the coast of Chili in
latitude 29° S. at about 8 . 15 a.m. of local time, passed over the high
lands of that country, across the borders of Argentina and Paraguay,
and over the vast plains and forests of Central Brazil, emerging, at
about noon of local time, at a short distance to the north-west of
Ceara on the North Atlantic seaboard.              Crossing the Atlantic, at
about its narrowest part, it struck the coast of Africa north of the
river Gambia, and finally disappeared somewhere in the Sahara. It
would seem, therefore, there was ample choice in the selection of
stations.    But all situations were not equally good or equally avail
able. There were, indeed, special reasons why every effort should be
put forth to observe this eclipse as completely as possible. To begin
with, it had an unusually long totality — upwards of four minutes at
places at or near the central line of the shadow.              Next, it occurred
at about a period of maximum of solar energy, and hence we had an
    * A full report of the discourse is given in the  '
                                                        Fortnightly Review,' July
1893.

1893.]                  on the Recent Solar Eclipse.                  143
opportunity of solving certain questions as to the connection between
the character of the corona and the solar cycle.         Further, it was
hoped that by multiplying the stations along the path of the eclipse,
and therefore by making observations at considerable intervals of
time, the photographic records might decide upon the possibility of
changes in the form and internal disposition of the corona — a question
of the greatest importance in regard to the physical nature of this
solar appendage.
      After careful consideration of sites, and of the various sugges
tions which were made as to the nature of the work to be undertaken,
a committee, representing the Boyal Society, the Boyal Astronomical
 Society, and the Solar Physics Committee of the Science and Art
 Department, decided to send two observers to Para Curu, in the
 province of Ceara in Brazil ; and four observers to some station in
 Senegal, preferably Fundium, on the Salum river. Substantially the
 same scheme of work was arranged for the two parties.           Spectro
 scopic observations with the Prismatic Camera and a series of photo
 graphs with what is now known as the Duplex Coronagraph were to
 be taken at each station.     In the case of the African station, it was
 further decided that photometric measurements of the coronal light
 should be made by the method adopted by Captain Abney and myself
 on the occasion of the West Indian eclipse of 1886.
      It will be understood that the work of both parties was entirely
 confined to the study of the corona. In the first place, photographic
 records of its form, its extension and internal structure were to be
 made according to a uniform plan at both stations.       The apparatus
 to be used consisted of a sort of double camera, in one compartment
 of which was placed a 4-inch lens of 60 inches focus, belonging to
 Captain Abney, which has already seen much service in eclipse
 photography.     It was employed in Egypt in 1882, in the Caroline
 Islands in 1883, in the West Indies in 1886, and in the Salut Isles,
 in French Guiana, where that veteran eclipse observer, Father Perry,
 lost his life, in 1889.    One special reason for using this lens was
 that the continuity of the series of photographs which have been
 obtained by it might be maintained.       It gives pictures on the scale
 of about half an inch to the moon's diameter. In the other com
  partment was a 4-inch Dallmoyer photo-holiograph lens mounted
  in combination with a 2 \ -inch Dallmeyer negative lens of 8-inch
  negative focus, giving with the total length of 68 inches pictures
  on the scale of over IK inch to the moon's diameter.       This double
  camera was fitted with special plate-carriers, enabling two plates to
  be exposed at the same time, one to each lens, so that by one opera
  tion of changing and exposing, two pictures of the eclipsed sun could
 be simultaneously obtained.      The times of exposure were so arranged
  that the longest exposed picture with the enlarging combination
  should receive the same photographic effect as the shortest exposed
  picture with the Abney lens. The whole arrangement was equa

144                       Professor   T. E. Thorpe                 (-June 9,
torially mounted, so that the plates were kept in a constant position
with respect to the sun during the times of exposure.
     Three different methods were employed to obtain photographic
records of the spectrum of the corona.        In the first, which was sug
gested by Professor    Norman     Lockyer more than twenty years ago,
the eclipsed sun was to be photographed through a prism attached
to a telescope of 6-inch aperture.       In this manner an image of the
corona would be obtained corresponding with each kind of light
emitted by it. Thus, if the corona consisted entirely of glowing
hydrogen, there would be an image in the position occupied by each
of the lines in the hydrogen spectrum. If, as may be expected, the
materials composing the corona are different in different regions, the
images obtained will not exactly resemble each other, but the form
of each image will depend upon the distribution of that particular
spectral line through the corona. The complete spectrum of every
part of the corona which is bright enough to be photographed will,
therefore, be obtained with a single exposure.
     The other method of studying the spectrum of the corona is by
means of the ordinary slit spectroscopes. The arrangement, employed
 by Captain Hills, consisted of two spectroscopes, each provided with
a condensing lens and camera, mounted on an equatorial stand.           The
 spectroscopes were of different dispersive power, one having two
prisms, and the other one.       The slits were placed parallel to each
other, and were so arranged as to cut across opposite limbs of the
 sun at right angles to the sun's equator.       An image of the sun is
 thrown on the slit by the condensing lens, and the slit is long enough
 to cover the whole width of the corona. The resulting photographs
 ought then to show at least three different spectra: a continuous
 spectrum over the dark body of the moon, on either side of which
 will appear the prominence spectrum, and outside of which again will
 be the true corona spectrum, which may or may not be broken up
 into bands by the occurrence of rifts or dark spaces in the corona.
 This method has the great advantage of discriminating between the
 different spectra of every portion of the corona along the line of the
slit ; the main difficulty connected with it is the want of light, which
makes it almost impossible to give a sufficient exposure unless the
 slit is opened rather wide. It was decided, therefore, to make only
 one exposure with each spectroscope ; this was to last as nearly as
 possible the whole time of totality, and the most rapid photographic
 plates procurable were to be used.
      The measurement of the visual brightness of the coronal light
 was to be effected by the following arrangement.         An image of the
 corona is accurately  focused  on  a  white screen by   means  of an equa
 torial of 6-inch aperture   and   78-inch focal length, and the intensity
 of the light from different portions of the corona at definite distances
 from the limb is compared with that of a standard glow-lamp by
 means of an arrangement constructed on the principle of the Bunseu

1893.]                  on the Recent Solar Eclipse.                 145
photometer, the light from the standard glow-lamp being varied by
introducing a variable amount of resistance into the current and
measuring the current strength at the moment of comparison.
    In order to ascertain the total intensity of the coronal light
Mr. Forbes employed a similar contrivance, his screen, however,
having only one large translucent spot or disc, as in the ordinary
Bunsen photometer.        Concurrently with these observations it was
arranged that the photographic intensity of the coronal light, as dis
tinct from the visual intensity, should also be measured by a method
devised by Captain Abney, which consists in impressing standard
intensity scales along the edges of the photographic plates to be
exposed in the coronagraph, these being developed at the same timo
as the coronal pictures.     The photographic plates to be used in the
split spectroscope were also provided, in like manner, with standard
scales, with a view of measuring the comparative luminosity of dif
ferent portions of the coronal spectrum, a point which has an im
portant bearing on the question of the possibility of photographing
the corona in ordinary sunlight.
     On the day preceding that of the eclipse the French gunboat
Brandon came up the river, bringing with her the Governor of
 Senegal. His Excellency M. de la Mothe, together with the adminis
trator of the district, M. Allys, to whom the expedition is indebted
for many courtesies, paid a visit to the English camp at Fundium
and witnessed the final rehearsal of our operations.       They arranged
for a guard to protect the enclosure during the time of the eclipse,
and gave orders that all chanting, screaming, or beating of tom-toms
in the village was to be forbidden.
     On Sunday, the 16th, the day of the eclipse, although the morn
 ing was bright and clear, the effects of the comparatively moist winds
from the sea were to be seen in the changed colour of the sky and
 the prevalence of thin haze.       Still the sky was almost cloudless,
save for a few thin wispy cirri, which floated almost motionless
near the horizon.        A gentle air from the west made scarce a
ripple on the yellow waters of the Salum. As the day advanced,
 the sky became even lighter in colour, and there was a perceptible
 haze in the neighbourhood of the sun ; the wind almost died
 away, and everything betokened that we should have to face — as
 indeed we fervently hoped might be the case — the pitiless glare of
 that fiercest of all suns —the African sun at noon. At 12 . 30 our
 party went ashore, the huts were uncovered, the equatorials adjusted,
 clocks wound, and the instruments set running on the sun. Shortly
 before 2 p.m. the officers and men from the Alecto, bringing their lan
 terns, came to the camp and took up their several positions.      As the
 light waned there was a distinct feeling of chilliness in the air, and
 the wind suddenly rose in short sharp gusts.        The few natives who
 had congregated round the stockade began to show signs of trepida
 tion, but no sound of distress or fear was heard save the plaintiv*

cry of     a tethered goat near the administrator's house.     There was a
great    hush   as the last gleam   of  sunlight  died  away. The corona
seemed almost to flash into existence, so suddenly did its light grow
in intensity. Faint indications of its appearance could, indeed, be
perceived on the photometer screen some seconds before the last trace
of the yellow crescent disappeared.           The phenomenon known as
" Baily's beads " was plainly visible.       The lower corona was wonder
fully bright, and a whole row of prominences started into view. The
panaches, sheafs, and other evidences of
                                               " structure " were distinctly
marked on the white screen. The general sky illumination was so
 great that only some five or six stars were visible.           The gloom,
                                            I
 indeed, was nothing like so intense as had seen in previous eclipses,
 and there would have been little difficulty in reading the second
 hand of the chronometer or the scales of the ammeters without the
 aid of the lighted lanterns.       And now the oft-repeated programme
 was being gone through for the last time, with a quickened sense and
 a concentrated earnestness springing from the consciousness that
 the veritable four minutes — the 240 and odd seconds — on which
 our thoughts for months past had been dwelling, were now
 speeding away, and that, with the first rush of sunlight on
  the other side of the black disc of the moon, our opportunities
  would be gone for ever. The silence was most impressive ; it was
 broken by the stentorian voice of the quartermaster as he told us at
  intervals, by the aid of his log-glass, the number of seconds that
  still remained to us. Now and again, too, one heard from the
  adjoining huts the command to expose, and the sharp click of the
  carriers as slide after slide was inserted and withdrawn.          Thanks
  to the repeated drills, everything went with the smoothness and
  regularity of clockwork. There was no hitch or stoppage, and no
  undue haste on the part of anybody.            Sergeant Kearney secured
  ten out of the twelve corona pictures that he had been instructed to
  make. Mr. Fowler, in all, made thirty exposures in the prismatic
   camera, including a number taken during the five minutes before
   and after totality ; and Captain Hills obtained both his slit-spectro
   scope photographs.       Mr. Gray and      I  made    twenty photometric
   measurements of the light from different parts of the corona, and
   Mr. Forbes obtained eleven concordant observations of its total
   intensity.    The full measure of our success was not yet known to us,
   but every man had the certain knowledge that he had secured enough
   to make the eclipse of April 16, 1893, take its place as one of the
   best observed eclipses of recent times, and that his work, done at the
   sacrifice of much personal comfort, and under the trying circum
   stances of a fierce temperature and an unhealthy climate, would
   contribute towards the solution of one of the most profoundly inte
   resting of all physical problems.
       After a short rest the command, " Down huts," was given, and in
   a few hours the Alecto, with all our cases once more packed and

safely stowed, was groping her way amongst the shallows and banks
of the Salum down to the sea. The memory of our green-canvassed
structures and of the strange instruments of brass and iron with
which we English sought to shoot the moon for trying to eat up the
sun has now doubtless become one of the traditions of the Wolofs
and Sereres of Fundium.
    M. Deslandres,    I am happy to say, was not less successful.   In a
communication which he has just made to the French Academy
he gives a brief account of some of the main results he has
gathered from the photographs which he was able to take.             His
instrumental equipment enabled him to obtain photographs of the
corona, to study its spectrum, to examine the coronal light in the
most refrangible part of the ultra-violet, and to measure the rotation
of the corona by the method of displacement of the lines in its spec
trum.    His coronal photographs showed luminous jets of a length
equal to twice the diameter of the sun, while the general form was
similar to that usually observed at times of maximum sun-spot
frequency.    The spectrum photographs have revealed the existence
of at least fifteen new coronal and chromospheric lines.         But the
most novel of M. Deslandres's observations relate to the rotation of
the corona.     His negatives showed the spectra of two points on
exactly opposite sides of the corona, situated in the equatorial plane
of the sun, at a distance equal to two-thirds of his diameter. The
lines in the spectra indicated large displacements, and from the
measurements, M. Deslandres concludes that the corona must travel
 nearly with the disc in its motion, and thus be subject to its perio
dical rotational movement.
    M. Bigourdan, who had been stationed at Joal, on the coast of
Senegal, since December last, for the purpose of observing southern
nebulae   and making pendulum observations, was commissioned
by the Bureau des Longitudes to search during the eclipse for the
inter-mercurial planet which Leverrier assumed to exist, and which
he named Vulcan.          M. Bigourdan was also requested to make
careful determinations      of all the four contacts, with a view of
obtaining   additional  data  for correcting the tables of the motion of
the sun and moon.
    As regards Vulcan, M. Bigourdan was not more successful than
his predecessors, but he determined with great accuracy the time of
the total phase at Joal, which he found to be 4 min. 1 sec.     My own
observations at Fundium, which is about as much to the south of
the probable central line as Joal is to the north, gave 4 min. 3 sec.
as the time of totality, which is in very fair accord with M. Bigour-
dan's determination.      M. Coculesco, a young Roumanian astronomer,
who volunteered to accompany M. Deslandres to Fundium, found
4 min. 11 sec.
    As yet we have only meagre information of the results obtained
                                                                           s

Although large portions of the sky were covered with cumuli, the
sun was not clouded over at the period of totality ; the atmosphere,
of course, was nearly saturated with aqueous vapour, but no haze or
precipitation of moisture seems to have occurred, and in consequence
of the remarkable transparency of the air the photographs are cer
tain to be of exceptional interest.
     The Americans, who were mainly stationed in Chili, were equally
fortunate.    At Minas Aris, the Harvard College station, the atmo
spheric conditions are said to have been all that could have been
wished for ; there was no passing cloud or haze to mar the observa
tions.   The corona is reported by Professor Pickering to resemble
that of 1857, as portrayed by Liais, and that of 1871, as observed by
Captain Tupman.       There were four streamers, two of which had a
length exceeding the sun's radius, or stretching out more than
 435,000 miles.    Several dark rifts wero visible, extending outwards
from the moon's limb to the utmost limit of the corona.        No rapid
movement was observed within the streamers.         The moon appeared
 of almost inky blackness, while from behind        streamed out on all
                                                       it,
sides radiant filaments, beams, and sheets of pearly light. The inner
corona was of dazzling brightness, but still more dazzling were the
 eruptive prominences which blazed through             it,
                                                    to use the words of
 Professor Young, like carbuncles.    Generally, the inner corona had
 a uniform altitude, forming  a ring of four minutes of arc in width,
 but separated with more or less definiteness from the outer corona,
 which projected to far greater distance, and was much more irregu
                    a
lar in shape. The outer corona seems to have been much larger
 than in 1879 or 1889, as, indeed, might have been expected at            a
 period of maximum solar energy. The party seems to have been
                                                                        "
 successful in photographing for the first time the " reversing layer
 of the solar atmosphere.
     Professor Schaeberle, from the Lick Observatory, who observed at
 Mina Bronces, in the Desert of Atacama, reports that the corona
 was similar to that of 1883.   He obtained in all fifty photographs,
 eight of which are ten by twenty inches in size, and one of which
 shows an image of the sun four inches in diameter, the corona cover
 ing a plate eighteen by twenty-two inches — a truly " record

 The photographs are said to afford strong presumptive evidence of
 the truth of the mechanical theory of the corona which       associated

  I   cannot close without some reference to the debt of gratitude we
are under to Captain Lang and his officers, for the readiness, zeal,

                   SPECIAL GENERAL MEETING,
                         Friday, December    15, 1893.
       The Honorary Secretary (Sir Frederick Bramwell) reported that
   by order of His Grace the Duke of Northumberland,             K.G. (the
   President), this Special General Meeting had been summoned to pass
   a vote of sympathy and condolence with Mrs. Tyndall on the occasion
   of the death (on December 4th) of Dr. Tyndall, Honorary Professor
   of Natural Philosophy of the Institution.
       The Honorary Secretary read a letter from the President expressing
  regret at his inability to be present, and thereupon
     Sir James Ckiohton-Browne,       M.D. LL.D. F.R.S. Treasurer      and
                  Vice-President,  was voted into the  Chair.
      There were also present : — Sir John Lubbock, Sir Richard Webster,
  Sir Joseph Lister, Sir Frederick Abel, Lord Grimthorpe, Sir Douglas
  Galton, Sir Philip Magnus, Dr. Edward Frankland, Dr. J. H. Glad
  stone, Dr. Thomas Buzzard, and Professor Dewar.
      The Honorary Secretary read letters and telegrams of regret
  from many Members unable to be present, and expressing sympathy
  with the object of the meeting :— among these were Lord Kelvin, Lord
 Rayleigh, the Comte de Paris, Sir James N. Douglass, Sir William
 O. Priestley, the Rev. Canon Jenkins, Mr. Joseph Brown, and
 Dr. Anderson.
                                                             I
      Sir James Criohton-Browne (the Chairman) said : think may      I
 venture to say that it is good for us to be here this afternoon — to
 withdraw ourselves, for a brief period, from business pursuits or
 pleasures, to assemble together in a place hallowed by the life-work
 of a great man who has just passed from amongst us — to build an altar
 to his memory, and to burn thereon the incense of our gratitude and
 admiration.
      And nowhere more fittingly than in the Royal Institution of
Great Britain can a tribute to the memory of the late Professor
Tyndall be paid, for not only was his scientific career co-extensive
with his connection with this Institution, but he found in it the
opportunities which made that career possible, and he gave back to
it the first and best fruits of his scientific labours.       Tyndall con
tributed many papers to the Royal Society and British Association ;

he published many books and pamphlets ; he lectured in many places ;
but it was in the Royal Institution that his days were spent ; it was
in its laboratories that his well-devised, skilfully-executed,     and far-
reaching researches were carried out ; it was in this theatre that, in
many fascinating chapters, the story of his work was told. So intimate
was his connection with this Institution, so thoroughly did he become
its genius loci, that there must be many of you here this afternoon
who, moved by your grief for his death, and touched by the associa
tions of the scene, can almost fancy you see his lithe, nervous
figure standing where    I now stand, and his keen, mobile countenance,
lighted up by the thick-coming conceptions of his nimble brain — can
almost fancy you hear his ringing voice making again clear to all the
dark and difficult sayings and discoveries of science.
     Impelled by the energy of Bunsen, and drawn by the magnetism
of Faraday, Tyndall may be said to have formally dedicated himself
to science when he delivered his first Friday evening discourse here on
" The Influence of Material Aggregation on the Manifestations of
Force," on the 11th of February, 1853.       His last, his valedictory dis
course, the last public lecture he ever gave, on " Thomas Young and the
Wave Theory," was delivered here on the 22nd of January, 1886, and
in the interval between these dates, covering more than a generation, he
poured forth an almost continuous stream of lectures and discourses,
marking the progress of those branches of science to which he devoted
himself, and to the advancement of which he so largely contributed
by his researches, marking also the expansions of science as a whole,
and the mutations of speculative thought, and distinguished — always
distinguished — by a rare lucidity of style and a rich drapery of lan
 guage, which, however, never concealed, but only gracefully expressed
thought.    The late Professor Goodsir's constant monition to his assis
tant in their anatomical researches was, " Let us have God's truth,
 Mr. Arthur ; nothing but God's truth," and Tyndall was not less loyal
 than Goodsir in his allegiance to the eternal verities.          He never
 allowed himself to be seduced by the sunny glades of verbiage by
 as much as one hair's breadth from the path of strict accuracy, and
 his lectures will always be remarkable for the degree in which
 they combine solid scientific information with appropriate literary
 adornments.
     Tyndall delivered, in all, in this Institution 51 Friday evening
 discourses, 307 afternoon lectures, and 12 Christmas courses, com
 prising 72 lectures, and no one who has not himself delivered a dis
 course or lecture here is in a position to estimate what an enormous
 expenditure of mental energy such a record implies — especially in the
 case of a lecturer like Tyndall who had often to sum up in a few
 words the results of weeks and even months of patient original inves
 tigation, and who before each lecture had to make elaborate prepara
 tion for experiments. He was no idler in the field, and if he some
 times reaped what others had sown, it was his happy faculty to be

  1893.]                    Special General Meeting.                       163
 able to convert the crop at once into wholesome and palatable bread
 for general consumption.      It is as a popular expounder of science that
 Tyndall stands pre-eminent.        It is as a translator ot texts of nature
 that but for him must long have remained hieroglyphic that he will
 be best remembered.      It is as an evangelist of science, primarily to
 the intelligent and educated classes, but ultimately to all, that his
 greatest influence has been exerted. He was one of the Apostles of a
 new dispensation.     His teachings altered the very spirit of the times,
 and created a tolerance of scientific truth which it had not before
 enjoyed.    He might have been a martyr to science had he been less
 amply endowed with weapons of defence and attack.
     Professor Tyndall was wont,      I  believe, to trace his descent from
 William Tyndale, one of the first English translators of the
 Scriptures, and the argument from heredity ought,              I   think, to
compensate for some gaps in the genealogy, which,             I  understand,
 existed, for the two men, if we may judge by their character and
 work, seem to have been of the same stock and blood.                William
 Tyndale's aim was to place an open Bible within the reach of every
 ploughboy ; it was John Tyndall's aim to make another revelation
 accessible to all.  William Tyndale was a fearless controversialist ;
John Tyndall was not less so. William Tyndale's writings were
remarkable for their perspicuity, noble simplicity, propriety of idiom
and purity of style.    John Tyndall's writings are notable for the self
same charactei istics.     William Tyndale's last words, before he was
strangled and burnt, were,
                                   " Lord, open the King of England's
        "
eyes 1 John Tyndall's life-long aspiration was to open the people of
England's    eyes.
     We who had our eyes opened by Tyndall more or less, who were
led by him to look deeper, to discern more clearly — we who profited
by his prelections, will,   I am sure, always feel grateful for the en
lightenment he brought.       He was a brilliant expounder of scientific
truth ; he was an unrivalled experimentalist ; he communicated to
his auditors his own vivid convictions.        Always earnest in manner,
in his latter days he became almost vehement, as if he laboured under
a pressing obligation to deliver himself of his message before his
weary vigils closed in that long, sad, silent sleep on which he has
now fallen.
     Professor Tyndall's juvenile lectures here deserve special mention
because of their popularity and educational utility.        The first course
of these, on "Light," was delivered in 1862, and after that, year
after year, with only two exceptions, up to 1884, a Christmas course
was forthcoming ; each successive course being listened to by large
numbers of boys and girls, and by children of an older growth,
with the profoundest attention and delight.            These lectures were
veritably
            " the fairy tales of science," but they were imbued with
" the .long result of Time," and it seems to me that we are to
day drawing no small advantage from them. Many of those who

now take an interest in this Institution, who support it and pro
mote its objects, were baptised into science at Tyndall's Christmas
lectures.
     It is not for me, in the presence of some of the greatest living
masters of physical science, to attempt to define the significance or
estimate the value of Tyndall's contributions to natural philosophy.
That his researches in magnetism, light, heat, electricity, on ice and
water, on the cleavage of rocks, and on the atmosphere as a vehicle
                                                 I
of sound, were of great and permanent value do not doubt, and          I
trust something will be said about them by those who are well able
to appraise them.         I
                     But may perhaps be permitted to point out that
in that department of science with which     I am myself most familiar
— namely, biology — Tyndall did signal service. Not only did he
expose and snuff out some erroneous observations and fallacious
theories as to the spontaneous origin of life, which but for his
interference might have done much mischief and retarded progress ;
not only did he supply novel illustrations of the truths already
demonstrated by Pasteur, but he himself furnished original bacterio
logical observations which must always be thankfully remembered
and do infinite credit to his sagacity.     Having found that boiling,
which completely sterilised infusions in his earlier experiments,
subsequently failed to do so, it occurred to him that this might be
owing to the presence in the air of his laboratory of bacteria differing
 from those which he had first encountered in being possessed of
 spores, capable of resisting the temperature of boiling water — and
 this view, be it observed, suggested itself to him at a time when the
 existence of spores in bacteria had not been proved.    Then the truly
 luminous idea struck him that if his surmise were correct, thorough
 sterilisation might be effectually secured if the infusions, instead of
 being subjected to a single boiling, however prolonged, were sub
 mitted to a series of boilings of short duration on successive days.
 He calculated that the first boiling would prove fatal to the bodies of
 the full-grown adult and reproductive bacteria, although it might
  not prove destructive of the more resisting spores, and he further
 calculated that the products of the germination of these spores
 would not have time in a single day to grow to reproductive maturity
 and produce spores of their own, so that the second boiling would
 destroy all the bacteria that had resulted from the sprouting of the
 original spores in the interval.     And, further, he surmised that
 although all the spores present at the outset might not germinate
 in the first twenty-four hours, yet all might be expected to have
 done so within a few days, and thus, that in no long time, the daily
 boilings would have abolished the entire generation of bacteria, and
 rendered the solution absolutely and permanently sterile.    The result
 corresponded exactly with Tyndall's anticipations, and so he not
 only added to the natural history of bacteria by giving grounds
 for believing them to form spores, but devised the simple and

effectual method of sterilising liquids now universally employed by
bacteriologists.
    1 have tbe authority of Sir Joseph Lister for saying that Tyndall's
labours greatly facilitated the study of micro-organ isms and advanced
tbe knowledge of septic diseases in their various forms, and thus
promoted the progress of that antiseptic surgery for which Sir Joseph
Lister himself is mainly responsible, and to which we owe the wiving
of thousands, nay, of tens of thousands of lives and the abolition of
purgatories of human sufferings.
    I  have spoken of Tyndall as a Professor of this Institution, as a
teacher, as a writer, as an original investigator ; let me say one word
about him as a man, and     I have done.  And only one word about him
in this aspect is needful, for, as a man he was simplicity itself.
There was no subtilty about him, no complexity of nature requiring
unravelment, no organic incongruity inviting analysis.      He was almost
boyish iu his directness and transparency, almost womanly in his
tenderness ; but a true, strong man in all that does become a man.
He had a photosphere of charm around him, made up of emanations
of intellect and kindly courtesy. Impulsive he was, if you will, but
without impulse learning is apt to be pedantic, and science frigid
and repellant.    In a sordid age, he was untainted by wealth-worship,
and amidst many temptations he never turned his talents to mer
cantile account. It was his chivalrous devotion to truth and justice
that made him combative, and it was the simplicity of his tastes and
the frugality of his life that enabled him to indulge his lavish gene
rosity.   A little incident that has come to my knowledge illustrates
his benevolence. Many years ago a servant of this Institution had
the misfortune to lose his little daughter by scarlet fever. He had
only recently joined the staff and thought he was scarcely known to
Professor Tyndall, but he immediately received from him a letter
full of consoling sympathy and enclosing a five-pound note.
     Perhaps one touch of humour might have saved Tyndall from
some extravagances into which he ran, but it might also have made
him tamer and less picturesque than he was ; and we are content to
take him as he came to us, with all his human frailties, with all
his divine gifts. Of him it cannot be said, to use his own words, that
                                    "             " into the infinite azure
he was as " a streak of morning       vanishing
of the past," for he has become a bright particular star in the firma
ment of genius, shining through the darkness as long as the world
shall last. The clods of Haslemere may claim his ashes, but his
memory is the heritage of all mankind.
     The Chairman moved — "That the members of the Royal Institution
of Great Britain, in special general meeting assembled, hereby record
their deep regret at the death of Dr. John Tyndall, D.C.L. LL.D.
P.B.S., who was for forty years connected with the Institution as
 Lecturer, Professor and Honorary Professor of Natural Philosophy ;
and who, by his brilliant abilities and laborious researches, nobly

 promoted the objects of the Institution, and conspicuously enhanced
 its reputation, while at the same time he extended scientific truth,
 and rendered many new additions to natural knowledge practically
available for the service of mankind ; and that the members of the
 Boyal Institution further desire to convey to Mrs. Tyndall an ex
pression of their sincere sympathy and condolence with her in the
bereavement she has sustained in the loss of her gifted and distinguished
husband."
     Sir Biohabd Webster, in seconding the resolution, said : Ladies
                   I
and gentlemen, — possess no qualifications specially qualifying me to
second the resolution which has been proposed in such eloquent
and touching language by Sir James Crichton-Browne.           After listen
ing to his speech, my own feeling would be to content myself with
simply seconding the proposition without further words; but it is
fitting that on such occasion one who may be said to represent the
general public should join in the expression of sympathy and sorrow.
Our first thoughts to-day must be for her that is left behind, who
has with such wonderful tenderness watched over Tyndall's life ; no
words can too fully express our feeling for her. Of Tyndall          I may
be permitted to say that no one could hear him lecture without
catching something of the spirit which he threw into everything
which he undertook, making each subject that he handled appear to
be peculiarly his own.        Others, who follow me, will speak as         I
cannot venture to do of his work, but      I well remember when      I  was
quite a boy attending lectures given by Tyndall in this building,
and   I  was always impressed by the extraordinary facility which he
had of making people understand subjects of which, when they
entered the room, they were absolutely ignorant.         Tyndall had an
extraordinary power of generalisation, which he seemed almost by
instiuct to have acquired, so that he was able not only from his own
researches but from the careful study of the researches of others,
to state a proposition in such a way that it defied criticism, and
at the same time proved an invaluable guide to others.             He also
had an extraordinary power of clear exposition, which enabled even
the ignorant and unlearned to feel that he was imparting to them
some portion of his great knowledge.        Perhaps his greatest charac
teristic was that earnest power for work, which he not only displayed
himself but infused into all those who worked with him, and which
was, perhaps, not the least valued part of that heritage which he
has left to this Institution.
                               I
     Sir John Lubbock said : am not competent to express an opinion
as to the value of Prof. Tyndall's scientific work, but no doubt
you have called on me as one of his very oldest friends.        It was my
privilege to make many excursions with him, and        I  look back upon
them as among the greatest privileges of my life. His was a noble
and generous nature, and his conversation was not only full of in
struction, but what is bettor still, inspired one with a love of science.

 I shall never enter this Institution, and particularly this theatre,
 without thinking of him, and the recollection of his friendship will
always be one of my most cherished memories.                    With regard to
Mrs. Tyndall,     I  fear that nothing we can say can prove any consola
tion to her now ; but      I  hope the time may come when the sympathy
of so many devoted friends may bring some comfort to her.
     Dr. Edward Fb ankland said : After a knowledge of, and a
friendship with Tyndall extending over nearly half a century, have,      I
of course, formed very definite opinions of his character.                I first
met Tyndall in 1847, at Queenwood College, Hampshire, where,
for the first time in any school in England, experimental science
was taught.      It was this which attracted both of us to that Institu
tion, and led Tyndall, in the intervals of work, to embrace all
possible opportunities        of acquiring some knowledge of chemistry.
He was bright, sociable, original and greatly in earnest, with a fund
of enthusiasm and humour.            His individuality was so strong that       I
have never known any one in the least like him.              Fond of literature
and a devoted student of Carlylc and Emerson, also of Fichte and
 Goethe through translations, his mind was then almost a complete
blank concerning physical science in any form. He worked in my
laboratory and     I gave him lessons in chemistry ; in return he taught
me mathematics.        We attended each other's lectures and became fast
friends.    Eighteen months later we migrated to the University of
Marburg in Hesse Cassel to study chemistry under Bunsen, and
here Tyndall acquired a fair knowledge of qualitative and quantita
tive analysis ; but the advent of the young and enthusiastic Knoblauch,
as professor extraordinary of physics at Marburg in 1849, diverted
his attention from chemistry to physics, in which science he found
more scope for his mathematical knowledge.                  From Knoblauch's
laboratory    he  passed   to  that of  Magnus    in Berlin.   On returning to
England     in   1852,  he   made   the   acquaintance   of  Bonce   Jones and
Faraday,   and   became   professor    of natural  philosophy   in this Institu
tion in the following year. You, Sir, have so lucidly and graphically
described his subsequent career that there is no room for any observa
tions of mine ; except perhaps this, that, commencing the elementary
study of experimental science at the age of 27, Tyndall stands almost,
if not quite alone as regards the number and importance of his
original investigations, and the brilliant position which he achieved
in the course of the following forty years as an expounder of scientific
truths.
     Professor Dkwab also paid a touching tribute to the memory of
Dr. Tyndall, who had been for many years his personal friend, and
after referring to Tyndall's private life, he said :         I have never seen
such abject idolatry of life, sympathy, and care expended by any
human being as that of Mrs. Tyndall for her husband.                   However
sad the disaster which caused the death of the Professor, it ought to
be some consolation to her to think how many times she had been

ever known.
    The Resolution was spoken to by others, including Sir Joseph
Lister, Sir Frederick Abel, Lord Gbimthorpe, and Dr. J. H.
(Gladstone.
    Upon the Chairman putting the Resolution the whole of the
company rose, and the motion was adopted unanimously.

                 WEEKLY EVENING MEETING,
                       Friday, January  26, 1894.
      Basil Woodd Smith, Esq. F.R.A.S. F.S.A. Vice-President,
                              in the Chair.

                             Old Irish Song.
In the dim morning twilight of Ancient Erin, legend describes her
Fileas, or musical bards,   as constant attendants   upon the king and
chieftain.
     As Mr. Alfred M. Williams, the American critic, picturesquely
puts the tradition, "Surrounded by the Orsidigh, or instrumental
musicians, who fulfilled the function of a modern military band, they
watched his progress in battle for the purpose of describing his feats
in arms, composed birthday odes and epithalamia, aroused the spirits
of clansmen with war songs, and lamented the dead in the caoines, or
keens, which are still heard in the wilder and more primitive regions
of Ireland."
     We must, of course, discount much of the legendary colour which
enthusiasts like Walker take on trust.    But this is the picture of the
early Irish bard presented to us by the chroniclers.      Amongst other
privileges, he wore a tartan with only one shade of colour less than
that upon the king's robe, and his assassination involved a blood-
penalty inferior only to the royal eric. But before attaining such
high honours, he had to satisfy the moral requirements of " purity of
hand, bright without wounding, purity of mouth without poisonous
satire, purity of learning without reproach, purity as a husband in
wedlock."
     He had, moreover, to pass through a decidedly arduous courtship
of the Muse before he was entitled to claim her favour ; indeed, some
writers go so far as to say that, like the patriarch, he had to serve
seven years for her, committing to memory an almost incredible
number of earlier compositions, and giving the closest study to the
laws of verse, before he could become a poet on his own account.
     When it is added that these laws of Irish verse, as finally formu
lated by the early Celtic professors, were the most complicated ever
invented — not only limiting the sense within the stanza, but fixing
 the amount of alliteration and the number of syllables in each line,
 to say nothing of their assonantal requirements— we may well under
stand that although Early Irish verse may be granted, according to
Professor Atkinson, to be tho most perfectly harmonious combinations
 of sounds that the world has ever known, it must also be conceded

170                   Mr. Alfred Perceval Graves                  [Jan. 26,
that Irish "direct metre" was the most difficult kind of verso
under the sun —the despairing opinion of another leading Irish
philologist.
     Dr. Whitley Stoke's comment is " that in almost all the ancient
Celtic poetry, substance is ruthlessly sacrificed to form, and the observ
ance of the rigorous rules of metre seems regarded as an end in
itself." The consequence of such an artificial system, combined with
the high privileges of the bardic caste, resulted in the multiplication
of minor parts to a degree which would have paralysed all Mr. Traill's
efforts to keep pace with them, had he been a contemporary critic.
     O'Curry quotes this droll account of their pecuniary dealings : "At
this time we are told that the poets became more troublesome and
importunate than ever. They were in the habit of travelling about
the country in companies of thirty, composed of pupils and teachers,
and each company had a silver pot, called 'the Pot of Avarice,'
having chains of bronze attached to it by golden hooks. It was
suspended from the points of the spears of nine of the company,
which were thrust through the links at the other end of the chains.
The reason that the pot was called the Pot of Avarice was because it
was into it that whatever of gold or silver they received was put,
and, whilst the poem was being chanted, the best nine musicians in
the company played music round the pot. If their minstrelsy was
well received, and adequately paid for, they left their blessing behind
them in verse ; if it was not, they satirised their audience in the
most virulent terms of which their poetical vocabulary was capable ;
and, be it observed, that to the satire of an Irish bard, to whom there
still clung in the popular belief the mystical attributes of the druid,
there attached a fatal malignity."
     At the time of the conversion of Ireland to the Christian faith,
the bards were said to number a third of the male population, and
in 590 a.d. a Synod was held at Drumkeat, by Aed, king of Ulster,
which greatly reduced their forces. Indeed, such was the popular
irritation against them, that had it not been for the friendly inter
vention of the statesman-poet, St. Columbkille, they would probably
have been banished altogether.
     The Filea, or bard, no doubt was a minstrel as well as a poet, in
the first instance, but in the course of time there would appear to
have been a further bardic differentiation, and we learn that perfection
in the throe Musical Feats, or three styles of playing, gave the
dignity of Ollamh, or Doctor of Music, to the professors of the harp.
Now what were the three Musical Feats?               Here they are, well
described in a weird old folk tale.
     Lugh (the Tuatha da Danann king), and the Daghda (their great
chief and druid), and Ogma (their bravest champion), followed the
Fomorians and their leader from the battlefield of Moyturah, because
they had carried off the Daghda's harper, Uaithne by name.              The
pursuers   reached  the  banqueting   house  of  the Fomorian   chiefs, and
there   found  Breas,  the  son  of Elathan,    and   Elathan  the   son  of

1894.]                      on  Old Iruh Song.                        171
Delbath, and also the Daghda's harp hanging upon the wall. This
was the harp in which the music was spoil-bound, so that it would
not answer, when called forth, until the Daghda evoked it, when ho
said : " Come, Durdabla ; come, Coircethairchuir (the two names of
the harp).     Come, Samhan ; come, Camh, from the mouths of harps
and pouches and pipes. The harp came forth from the wall then,
and killed nine persons in its passage ; and it came to tho Daghda,
and he played for them the three musical feats which give distinction
to a harper, viz., the Suantree (which, from its deep murmuring,
caused sleep), the Gauntroo (which, from its merriment, caused
laughter), and the Golltree (which, from its melting plaintiveness,
caused crying).     He played them the Golltree, until their women
cried tears ; and he played them the Gauntree, until their women and
youths burst into laughter ; he played them the Suantree, until tho
entire host fell asleep.     It was through that sleep that they (the
three champions) escaped from those Fomorians who were desirous to
slay them."
     This passage is of threefold interest. It indicates the popular
belief in the introduction of music into Ireland by the Tuatha da
Danann, a mysterious race, by some regarded as an offshoot of tho
Danai, whom tradition declares to have conquered and civilised the
country and then to have disappeared from it into fairyland. Again,
it contains the first reference in Irish literature to the harp or cruit,
destined to become our national instrument.          Lastly, it describes
three styles of Irish music, of each of which we have characteristic
examples that have descended to the present day. For the Gauntree,
which was provocation of mirth and frolic and excited spirit, is
represented by the jigs, reels, planxties, and quick-step marches ; tho
Golltree, or the sorrowful music, still lingers in the keens or
lamentations, and some of our superb marches of the wilder and
sadder type; and the Suantree survives in many a beautiful Irish
hush song.
     The Irish sleep-compelling airs have not attracted the notice they
deserve. Moore ignored them altogether, but Dr. Petrie prints many
of them, and points out their resemblance to the slumber-tunes still
in vogue in India and elsewhere in the East. They certainly support
the tradition of the oriental affinities of the Early Irish.
     The first period of Irish bardic literature may roughly be said to
be that of epic poetry interspersed with songs. Fine exemplifications
of these are to be found in the ' Silva Gadelica,' a recent translation
of a series of Early Irish tales by Mr. Standish Hayes O'Grady.
The music to which they were sung has perished or become
dissociated from these lyrics, but some of their measures are identical
with those of rustic Irish folk tunes. We now come to the bardic
period, thus described by the poet Spenser in A View of the State
                                                   '
of Ireland ' : —
    " Iren. — There is amongst the Irish       a certain kind of people
called  Bardes, which are to them instead of Poets, whoso Profession
                                                               n 2

172                     Mr. Alfred Perceval Graves             [Jan. 26,

or Rithmes ; the which are had in so high Regard and Estimation
amongst them, that none dare displease them for fear to run into
Reproach through their offence, and to be made infamous in the
mouths of all men.
     "For their verses are taken up with a general applause, and
usually sung at all feasts and meetings by certain other persons,
whose proper function that is, who also receive for the same great
rewards and reputation amongst them."
     It would appear that the poet Spenser mado a study of the Irish
 poetry of his day, and a music-book of the sixteenth century, mis
 named ' Queen Elizabeth's Virginal Book,' contains three Irish airs,
 one of which, Callino Casturame, is evidently alluded to by Pistol in
                  '
 Shakespere's Henry V.,' who, on meeting a French soldier, cries,
 " Quality ! Caleno custure me " — clearly, " Colleen oge astore."
      Here it may be well to give, in full, the famous passage in
                                            '
 Spenser's ' View of the State of Ireland relating to the character of
 the bardic lyrics of his day.
      "Eudoxus. — But tell me (I pray you) have they any art in their
 compositions ? or be they any thing witty or well-favoured, as poems
 should be ?
      " Ireneeus. — Yea, truly,   I have caused divers of them to be
 translated unto me, that    I  might understand them ; and surely they
 were favoured of sweet wit, and good invention, but skilled not of the
 goodly ornaments of poetry ; yet wore they sprinkled with some
 pretty flowers of their natural device, which gave good grace and
 comeliness unto them ; the which it is a great pity to see so abused,
 to the gracing of wickedness and vice, which with good usage would
 serve to adorn and beautify Virtue.
      " As of a most notorious thief and wicked outlaw, which had
 lived all his lifetime of spoils and robberies, one of their Bardes in
 his praise will say, That he was none of the idle milksops that was
 brought up by the fireside, but that most of his days he spent in
 arms and valiant enterprizes ; that he did never eat his meat, before
 he had won it with his sword ; that he lay not all night slugging in
 a cabbin under his mantle, but used commonly to keep others waking
  to defend their lives ; and did light his candle at the flames of their
 houses, to lead him in the Darkness ; that the day was his night, and
  the night his day, that he loved not to be long wooing of wenches to
  yield to him, but where he came he took by force the spoil of other
  men's love, and left but lamentation to their lovers ; that his musick
  was not the harp, nor lays of love, but the cries of people, and
  clashings of armour : and finally that he died not bewailed of many,
  but made many wail when he died, that dearly bought his death.
       " Do you not think
                                (Eudoxus) that many of these praises
  might be applied to men of best deserts, yet are they all yielded to a
  most notable traitor, and amongst some of the Irish not finally
  accounted of. For the song, when it was first made and sung to a

1894.]                       on  Old Irish Song.                    173
person of high degree there, was bought (as their manner is) for
forty Crowns."
     The lyrical epoch alluded to by Spenser is the second era of
bardic poetry in Ireland. It embraces the period of the English
struggle for supremacy in the country — that terrible time of inter
necine war which alike brutalised the Saxon and the Celt. In times
such as these it was impossible to compose long narrative poems.
As Mr. Williams well puts it, " The inspiration of the bards was
turned to more direct appeals for war, rejoicings for victory, and
lamentations for misfortune and defeat. The poetry took a more
lyric form, and became an ode instead of an epic."
     Irish Music and Song had now fallen on evil days. The downfall
of the great Celtic families, and many of the great Anglo-Irish ones
who had espoused their quarrel with successive English Govern
ments, forced our national bards, for want of better support, to
wander from castle to castle, instead of remaining as leading figures
in the great households.
     Turlongh O'Carolan was the most remarkable of these wandering
lyrists. Born in the year 1670, he early lost his sight through small
pox, but solaced himself for this deprivation by the study of music,
in which he made astonishing progress.            The 'Irish Monthly
          '
Review gives this instance of his wonderful musical memory, and
his extraordinary power of musical improvisation. At the house of an
Irish nobleman, where Geminiani was present, Carolan challenged that
eminent composer to a trial of skill. The musician played over on
his violin the Fifth Concerto of Vivaldi, and it was instantly repeated
by Carolan on his harp, although he had never heard it before. The
surprise of the company was increased when Carolan asserted that
he would compose a concerto, himself, upon the spot ; and he did
then and there invent a piece that has since gone by his name.       He
composed upon the buttons of his coat, the buttons serving for the
purpose of the lines, and the intervals between them for the spaces.
     Carolan did not adhere entirely to the Irish style of composition,
and his musical pieces show a considerable Italian influence ; yet, as
Mr. Bunting writes, he felt the full excellence of the ancient music of
his country.     He was a most prolific composer. One harper at the
beginning    of this century was alone acquainted with about a hundred
of his tunes, and many were at that time believed to have been lost.
    Passing over the period of 1798, which does not furnish many
lyrics of first-rate quality, we now come to that important epoch in
Irish lyric literature — the Granard and Belfast meetings of harpers,
promoted with the object of reviving the taste for Irish music, which
had begun to decay. These meetings, which took place about the
year 1792, were very successful, and awoke in the distinguished
Belfast musician, Mr. Bunting, such an enthusiasm for Irish music,
that he thenceforth devoted his main efforts to its collection and
publication.     Of the Belfast meeting he writes thus vividly : —
    " All the best of the old class of harpers, a race of men
                                                                   then

174                     Mr. Alfred Perceval Graves              [Jan. 26,
nearly    extinct,  and now gone for ever, were present — Hempson,
O'Neill, Fanning, and seven others, the least able of whom has not
left his equal behind.     Hempson realised the antique pictures drawn
by Cambrensis and Galilei, for he played with long crooked nails,
and in his performance the tinkling of the small wires under the
deep notes of the bass wero particularly thrilling.     He was the only
one who played the very old music of the country, and this in a
style of such finished excellence as persuaded me that the praises of
the old Irish harp in Cambrensis, Fuller, and others, were no more
than just to that admirable instrument and its then professors.      But
more than anything else the conversation of Arthur O'Neill —who,
although not so absolute a harper as Hempson, was of gentle blood,
and a man of the world, who had travelled over all parts of Ireland
— won and delighted me. All that the genius of later poets and
romance writers has feigned of the wandering minstrel was realised
in this man. There was no house of any note in the north of Ireland,
as far as Meath on the one hand, and Sligo on the other, in which he
was not well-known and eagerly sought after."
     What are our grounds for believing that many of the airs played
at the harp meetings are very ancient ?
     First, the testimony of the harpers, most of them very old men,
at the Belfast meetings one hundred years ago, who smiled on being
interrogated by Bunting as to the antiquity of the so-called ancient
airs, and answered — " They are more ancient than any to which our
popular tradition extends."        Moreover, Bunting informs us that
" though coming from different parts of Ireland, and the pupils of
different masters, the harpers played these ancient tunes in the same
key, with the same kind of expression, and without a single variation
in any essential passage, or even in any note." He adds, " This
circumstance seemed the more extraordinary when it was discovered
that the most ancient tunes were in this respect the most perfect,
admitting of the addition of a bass with more facility than such as
were less ancient.     Hence we may conclude that their authors must
necessarily have been excellent performers, versed in the scientific
part of their profession, and that they had originally a view to the
addition of harmony in the composition of their pieces.
     " It is remarkable that the performers all tuned their instruments
upon the same principle, totally ignorant of the principle itself, and
without being able to assign any reason either for their mode of
tuning, or of their playing the bass." And here it may be mentioned
that the ancient Irish harps had commonly thirty strings, and were
tuned in the key of G, and that the Irish airs supposed to be the
oldest are in the ordinary major scale of G, and were played in this
key.     But, for the sake of variety, the harpers played tunes in other
scales, and melodies were composed in the scale of A, but with the
tuning of the harp unchanged.
     But the strongest proof of the skill of the Irish harpers of the
thirteenth century is the testimony of Gerald Barry, best known as
               \

  1894.]                         <m Old Irish 8mg.                        175
  Giraldus Cambrensis, an inveterate opponent of everything else
  Irish — " They are incomparably more skilful than any other nation
  I  have ever seen. For their manner of playing on these instruments,
  unlike that of the Britons or (Welsh) to which           I am accustomed, is
  not slow and harsh, but lively and rapid, while the melody is both
  sweet and sprightly.     It is astonishing that in so complex and swift
  a movement of the fingers the musical proportions as to tune can be
  preserved ; and that throughout the difficult modulations on their
  various instruments, the harmony is completed with such a sweet
  rapidity. They enter into a movement and conclude it in so delicate
 a manner, and tinkle the little strings so sportively under the doeper
 tones of the bass strings— they delight so delicately, and soothe with
  such gentleness, that the perfection of their art appears in the con
  cealment of Art."
      John of Salisbury (twelfth century) is equally eulogistic, and
  Fuller says, "Yea, we might well think that all the Concert of
 Christendom in this war and the Crusade conducted by Godfrey of
 Boulogne      would have made      no music    if   the Irish harp had  been
 wanting."      There is indeed a continued record of praise (British and
 Continental) of the Irish music and its professors from the twelfth
 to the seventeenth centuries, which we may conclude by Drayton's
 stanza in his Polyolbion : —
                       "The Irish    I  admire,
                         And still cleave to that lyre
                            As to our Muse's mother;
                         And think, till I expire,
                            Apollo's such another."
      The antiqnity of individual airs has distinct historical confirma
 tion by Bunting and others.           The tune called 'Thugamar fein a
             '
 sowra lin was sung to welcome the landing of the Duke of Ormond
 by a band of Virgins who went out to meet him from Dublin. Again,
                                                   '
 the ancient Irish air ' Summer is coming is the same song practi
           '
 cally as Summer is a comin in,' which is reputed as the first piece
 of music set in score in Great Britain. Bunting claims that air,
 therefore, for Ireland on the ground of the extreme improbability of
its having been borrowed by the ancient Irish from a country that
has no national music of its own (the Welsh excepted). " Their igno
rance of the English language," he adds, " and their rooted aversion
to their invaders, were effectual bars to any such plagiarism or
 adoption."
      Besides the remarkable similarity between onr lullabies and those
of the East, already touched on, there is a marked correspondence
between some of the early Norse and ancient Irish tunes.                 The
distinguished     Swedish harpist, Sjoden, who visited Dublin on the
occasion of the Moore Centenary, showed me that some of our old
Irish airs — for instance — the ' Cruiskeen Lawn ' — were almost iden
tical with early Norse ones ; the question for settlement of course
                                                                 /

176                      Mr. Alfred Perceval Graves                [Jan. 26,
being, whether the Irish got them from the Danes or the Danes from
the Irish, though the musical reputation of our ancestors, amongst
whom the Danes formed maritime settlements at Dublin, Waterford,
Limerick, and elsewhere, points to the latter conclusion.        Then there
is the strong internal evidence of extreme antiquity from the old-
world characters of such airs as the ' March from Fingal.'
     To what poetical measures were these old airs sung ? We have,
fortunately, some clue to this, not only in the modern Irish words to
them published by Dr. Joyce, but in the important fact that we have
Irish poems, as early as the ninth century, which will sing to some
of the ancient airs ; for example, an invocation for God's protection
upon his coracle, by Cormac Mac Cullinane, King and Bishop of
Cashel, who died in 903. This measure is identical with that of
Shenstone's lines : —
                 " My  banks they are furnished with bees,
                   Whose murmurs invite us to sleep,
                   My grottoes are shaded with trees
                   And my hills are white over with sheep."
     Professor O'Curry puts the case very strongly, but not,        I think,
 too strongly, when he says, " Those verses of King Cormac McCul-
linane, now almost one thousand years old, which sing to the air of
 ' For Ireland   I  would not tell who she is,' is adduced as an inter
 esting fact, proving that a fragment of a lyric poem, ascribed to a
 writer of the ninth century, and actually preserved in a MS. book
so old as the year 1150, presents a peculiar structure of rhythm,
exactly corresponding with that of certain ancient musical composi
tions still popular and well known, and, according to tradition, of
 the highest antiquity.
       I
     " believe such a fact is unknown in the musical
                                                             history of any
 other nation of Europe ; and yet in ours very many such instances
could be adduced of ancient lyric music still in existence, in minutely
 exact agreement with forms of lyric poetry used not only in but
 peculiar to the most ancient periods of our native literature."
     A large proportion of the Irish airs are in eight-line measures,
 consisting of two quatrains ; though originally it would appear that the
 verses consisted of four lines only, in which event the range of the
 air was very limited.     But, as time went on, the strain appears to have
 been repeated, with a variation, and then added to by means of a
 strain of different character, the final musical measure being a repeti
 tion of the first strain.
     Stanzas built up to suit such airs largely consist of sixteen lines,
 which are quaintly called " curving eight-lined verses " — the meaning
 of the word curved referring to the second part of eight lines, which
 are added to the first eight to fill up the curve turn, or second part
 of the tune.
     Finally, it may be worth while to state the case of the Scotch
 claim to Irish airs, and the Irish claim to Scotch melodies.              A

1894.]                          on   Old Irish   Song.                     177
pedantic attempt has been made to specify certain Irish musical
characteristics, the absence of which will prove one of the airs in
dispute to be Scottish.     But Sir Robert Stewart justly points out
that the so-called unfailing characteristic of Irish, as of Chinese,
melody to omit the fourth and seventh of the scale, is by no means a
sure test.    In many Irish airs these intervals are wanting, in others
they both exist. In some they are omitted in the first strain and are
present in the second part of the air. Again, the presence of the sub-
mediant or sixth of the scale, supposed to be a never-failing test of
an Irish air, is equally emphatic in the Scottish air ' Auld Lang
Syne,' and many other Scottish tunes.
     The Scotch airs may be roughly classed as Highland tunes and
Lowland tunes. The first class have a close affinity with the Irish
music, and no wonder, for not only are the Highland Scotch of North
Irish descent, but the Scotch of the West coast were for centuries
 closely connected with their kinsfolk across the North Channel, and
a constant exchange of minstrelsy        must have therefore gone on
between them. The Lowland Scotch tunes form a large and dis
 tinct body of national melodies, composed by national musicians, and
 not found in Irish collections.     In Ireland there is a much larger
 body of airs acknowledged on all hands to bo purely Irish and not
 found in Scotch collections.
     Outside these airs there is a large number common to and claimed
 by both countries.    As Dr. Joyce pithily puts        " In regard to
                                                         it,                    a
 considerable proportion of them           now impossible to determine
                                          it   is
 whether they were originally Irish or Scotch.      A few are claimed in
 Ireland that are certainly Scotch, but       very large number claimed
                                                    a

                                                                       '
 Aroon or Bobin Adair                is
                                  an example.   From the earliest times
         '        '             '
it  was  a common practice among the Irish harpers to travel in Scot
 land.     How close was the musical connection between the two
 countries     hinted by the Four Masters when, in recording the death
              is
 of Mac Carroll, they call him the chief minstrel of Ireland and
 Scotland and there
             !           abundant evidence to show that this connection
                          is
 was kept up till towards the end of the last century."   Ireland was long
  the school for Scottish Harpers, as     was for those of Wales " Till
                                            it                         :
 within the memory of persons still living, the school for Highland
  poetry and music was Ireland, and thither professional men were
 sent to be accomplished in these arts."   Such facts as these sufficiently
 explain why so many Irish airs have become naturalised in Scotland.            I
      " It    not correct to separate and contrast the music of Ireland
             is
  and that of Scotland as     they belonged to two different races. They

                          Friday February       2, 1894.

                       T.  J.  Corden-Sanderson, Esq.
                    Bookbinding    :  its Processes and Ideal.
Bookrinding is in itself      a comparatively simple matter and is easily
described ; but it is associated with great and interesting conditions
of society, and at its highest rises into disinterested admiration by
such means of expression as are within its reach of what is most
beautiful and wonderful in human achievement, the written and
printed speech of man. Binding, moreover, like every other handicraft,
is on its ideal side a discipline and a type of life.    I propose, therefore, to
explain   indeed  how  a  book  is   bound,   and  how, when   bound, it may be
tooled.     But I  propose  also  throughout     to set the  craft into imagina
tive sympathy with the thought it would perpetuate ; to touch upon
its origin, its history and its patrons, to characterise the styles of the
great periods of tooled decoration ; to insist upon the need of some
new departure in the invention and development of pattern ; and
finally, leaving the special objects of the binder's craft, to find in the
intuition of the harmony of the universe an outline of the ideal of the
craftsman and of the artist.
     Speaking generally, binding has its origin in the desire to per
petuate thought.      Before the discovery or invention of pliable port
able material suitable for writing upon, " binding was sought for and
                                                           "
found in imperishable natural objects, stones, tablets, columns, ready
to hand, upon which the thought was permanently incised.                  In this
case the binding may be said to have preceded the writing.                 It was
only when writing was made upon separate pieces or sheets of a pliable
and perishable material, that binding proper was invented to hold the
pieces or sheets together and to give strength to them, and protection
and beauty.
     But here again a distinction must be made. The pliable written
sheet may be either rolled or folded, each giving rise to a form of
binding peculiar to itself.
     The rolled sheet is bound by fastening each sheet to the other
sideways, and rolling the whole laterally from end to end, the last
sheet serving as a cover to all the rest.
     The folded sheet, on tho other hand, is bound by simply sewing or
                         \

1891]            on Bookbinding : its Processes and  Ileal.          179
otherwise fastening the parts of the sheet to one another at the hack
crease or fold.   And a number of folded sheets or of sections, as they
are called, are bound by fastening each of them at the back to some
common support, so that when all are sewn or otherwise fastened at
the back, they may yet be free to open and shut at the front, or fore-
edge.
     The invention of the folded sheet thus gave rise to the invention
of modern binding, which in its essence is the union at the back of
the folded sheets, which together constitute the folded book, or as     I
might say, despite the latent contradiction, the folded volume.
     Throughout the long period which has elapsed since the invention
of the folded sheet —it is said to have been invented in the third
century before Christ — binding must have undergone many and
important changes.       But of these changes few records remain.
Speaking generally of the binding of the middle and later ages, we
may say that at each successive epoch the form of the binding
adapted itself to the state of literature at the time.       When books
were few and large and stationary, the binding was correspondingly
large and bossy and heavy ; and when books became numerous and
lighter and portable, the binding adapted itself to the new conditions,
and, dropping the oak boards, the brass fittings, clasps, bosses and
chains, became itself light and portable and beautiful.        And thus
wood, and silk, and velvet and leather, iron and brass, and silver and
gold, and precious stones, were all used by the artificers of the middle
and earlier ages, in the protection and embellishment of the world's
written wealth.     The invention of printing, however, and the multipli
cation of books, gave the victory to leather and to gold tooling, and
with the invention of printing, binding passed into its modern phase,
and became ultimately a craft apart, the craft of the bookbinder.
    To the renown of bookbinding many countries and cities and
patrons have contributed, as well as the artists and craftsmen whose
work it has been. Singularly enough the names of very few bookbinders
are known, but it is well known that to Grolier and to France is
mainly due the gold tooling which is still the chief means of making
the bound book beautiful.        This tooling, of obscure origin, was
practised first in Europe in Italy, but was soon after introduced into
 France by Grolier, and the French schools of the sixteenth and seven
teenth centuries are still the great schools of design in that decorativo
method.
     Deserving of mention or of allusion in this connection, even in tho
shortest account of bookbinding, are the innumerable crafts — crafts
 for the production of materials and crafts for the production of tools —
upon which the binder's own craft depends. For this collaboration of
crafts is a fact of capital importance and should always be borne in
mind, that the solidarity of all industries may be understood and tho
dignity of each be appreciated.
     It is to be regretted, however, that at this moment the craftsmen
immediately concerned in making a book, the paper-maker, tho

 180                      Mr. T.  J. Cobden-Sanderson              [Feb.  2,
printer, and the binder, are not in possession of ideas bearing and
 operative upon the book as a whole, and controlling their several
 crafts to the one common end of the book beautiful, and the
 binder is in the unfortunate position of coming last, to inherit all,
and be helpless under, the mistakes of his predecessors the paper
maker, printer and publisher.
     Modern binding may be divided into two main divisions :
     1. Bindings for use.
     2. Bindings for beauty's sake.
     I do not say that the divisions can be precisely defined or that the
useful may not be beautiful, or that the beautiful may not be useful.
I  mean only that of a certain class the utility of the binding is the
main characteristic, and that of a certain other class not the utility of
the binding but the beauty of the decoration is the prominent and
delightful feature. All bindings may be, and most bindings are,
decorated in some form or other, but        I would deprecate the decora
tion in gold of cloth or paper bindings : the material is too poor
and the kind of binding is unsuitable for elaborate invention.     Decora
tion should be reserved for cases in which a permanent pleasure is
aimed at, and decoration in all its affluence exclusively for bindings of
the best kind, and for books that are in themselves, apart from their
apparel, beautiful and worthy of conspicuous honour.
     The binding of a book, to come closer to our subject, is a series
of processes too numerous to be entered upon in detail, in so short
an account of bookbinding as the present, but the main operations are
as follows :
     1. The sheets are folded so that the headlines of each page shall,
if  possible, be at a uniform height throughout the book.
     2. The sections are then sewn to cords, set and held at equal
distances from one another in a frame, and at right angles to the
sections.
     3. The ends of the cords are frayed out and laced into and
fastened to rectangular pieces of millboard (called boards), cut to
the size of the sides of the book, which they protect.
     4. The boards and back are then covered with leather or other
suitable material, and the last and first sheets of the book (added to
the book proper for the purpose) are pasted down upon the inside of
the boards.
     The book so treated is completely " forwarded," as it is called,
and ready to pass into the hands of the " finisher
                                                         " to be tooled or
decorated, or " finished."      The decoration in gold on the surface of a
bound    book  is wrought    out  bit by bit by means of small engraved
brass stamps   called "  tools."   The steps of the process are shortly as
follows :               ,
     1. The pattern is first worked out with the tools blackened in
the smoke of a candle or lamp, upon a piece of paper cut to the
exact size of the portion of the book to be decorated.
     2. The piece of paper with the pattern upon it is then applied
                           1

1894.]           on Bookbinding : its Processes and   Ideal.          181
to the surface to be decorated, and the pattern is reimpressed on the
paper, and bo through on to the surface of the book.
      3. The paper is now removed, and the pattern on the book is
reimpressed with hot tools to make the impression crisp and distinct.
      4. At this stage a different process begins.    The surface of the
cover, with the pattern impressed upon it as described, is taken bit
by bit and treated as follows :
      1. First it is moistened with water or vinegar.
      2. Then the pattern is pencilled over with
                                                     " glaire," which is a
 liquid composed of the white of an egg beaten up and drained off.
      3. Then, when the glaire is dry, the surface is lightly touched
 with oil or grease to give a hold to the gold leaf next to be applied.
      4. Then the gold leaf, cut to the size and shape of the portion of
 the cover to be operated on, is applied by a flat brush called a " tip,"
 and pressed down by a pad of cotton-wool to reveal the pattern
 underneath.
      5. Then, and finally, the pattern with the gold upon it is gone
 over again with the hot tools, and the gold is impressed into it.
 The rest of the gold is rubbed away with an oiled rag, and the
 pattern is now displayed permanently in gold and "finished."
      The description is easy — how easy! — but the craft is difficult.
 Gold cannot be persuaded to stick as a friend may be persuaded to
 stay ; it must be made to stick, i.e. all the conditions upon which
 successful gold tooling depends must in all cases be observed, and
 there is the rub I What in each case— and the circumstances are
 never quite the same — are the conditions? How divine them?             A
 little more, or a little less, makes so much difference. How dry may
 the leather be, or how damp must it bo ? How much glaire ? How
 hot must the tools be ? When is the moment to begin 1 Then how
  difficult it is correctly to manipulate the tools, to keep them even
  upon the leather.       How difficult, finally, to keep the leather,
  throughout all the long and difficult operation, perfectly clean and
  the gold brilliant I What patience, what natural aptitude, what
  acquired skill, what fortitude I
                                     " The city sparkles like a grain of
  salt." Shall   I  ever succeed ? the apprentice may well ask himself.
  Shall  I  ever attain to such skill, to such consciousness of power,
     I
  that    shall not even know how to fail ? In this difficulty, too, and in
  the effort and ambition to overcome     it, lies further difficulty, the
                                                 a
  snare of the art, the temptation of the finisher.           He becomes
  engrossed in   it  — the finisher in mere finishing. He pursues       it
  positively, and not in subordination to design. And he achieves
  victory at last, only to find that what he should have achieved, the
  thing beautiful, has escaped him. Ho can tool, but he cannot
  design and he has so magnified execution that when completely
         ;
  successful, when completely triumphant, he          is then most con
  spicuously a   failure. The tremulous outline of design — and design
  appeals to the imagination, to the inner eye of the soul as well as to
  the outer eye of sense — the tremulous outline of design has perished

in the too great exactitude of his accomplished execution. Wholly
to achieve victory, indeed, in the binder's craft, to forget no end in
the prosecution of the means, to exaggerate no feature from long
practice and perfect skill, to permit no craft of hand to overcome the
judgment of the head, is, in bookbinding,         as in all crafts, an
exceedingly difficult task, and we have in the very development of a
craft the cause of its ultimate decay. But what an education the
prosecution of a craft is for the soul of a man ! The silent matter,
which is the craftsman's material, is wholly in his hands, it hears and
makes no reproaches, but it never forgives and it has no mercy.
Sunrise after sunrise lights the craftsman to his task, sunset after
sunset leaves him to his regret.        Shall the sun ever rise upon
victory or set upon contentment? It is a great struggle.         He only
knows how great the struggle is, who knows what the aim of craft
rising into the ideal is, and who tolerates, between him and           no         it,
cloud of self-illusion, no splendour of popular praise to blind or to
darken his gaze. And so through the work of his hand man may
rise indeed to his soul's height.    But the victory itself   withdrawn
                                                                      is
behind the veil.    The world may not know          when  it    achieved,
                                                                     it   is
and the artist himself may sometimes see          achieved, as he thinks,
                                                        it
when to reach   it he has yet to traverse the entire way of truth.
                 " Sown   in   a   wrinkle of the monstrous hill,
                  The oity — sparkles still,     a grain of salt."
     The great schools of design for the decoration of bound books
are the great schools of France of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries.
      1.The first great school — the school of Grolier as             may be
                                                                           it
called —   is characterised mainly by the simple motives of straightness
and curvature.        Straight and curved bands or straps, and straight
or curved     lines are interwoven one with the other and distributed on
a  more or less simple or intricate, but always symmetrical plan over
the sides and back and sometimes the edges of book.!         a
      2. The second great school — the school of the Eves —                             is
characterised by the symmetrical distribution over the side of the
cover of symmetrically drawn compartments or panels, and the union
of them all into one organic whole by the intermediation of twisted
or interwoven bands. This                its main and for its earlier years
                                          is
almost   its   only  characteristic.    But  the school attained its maturity
by   the  combination     with     itof an  independent contemporary style,
which consisted in the use of           number of branches, spreading from
                                          a
each corner of the cover towards the centre, the unity of the whole
being enhanced by a semis, simple or alternate, of some simple tools
over the whole of the side. The combination was effected under the
direction, if     not by the hands, of the great binders Nicholas and
Clovis Eve, and consisted in the enrichment of the interspaces of the
first style by means of the sprays and branches of the second. When
mature the school was characterised by compartments symmetrically

1894.]            on Bookbinding : its Processes and    Ideal.            183
distributed and connected, filled with dainty devices or with the
severer tools of the Grolier pattern, and supported and enriched in
the interspaces by foliated branches and sprays.
     3. The third great school — the school            of Le Gascon — and
perhaps the last, was characterised by the combination with the
geometrical framework of the preceding school of a new motive,
borrowed,     I  think, from the contemporary lace, or perhaps filigree
work, and used, ultimately, to fill in both the compartments or panels
and the space between them. The motive is an exceedingly simple
one, a small spiral of dots, but the close repetition of it has a
singularly rich if somewhat bewildering effect The school, however,
in what specially characterised it, has dropped the tradition of form
and is content with the glitter of gold.        The repetition of the spiral
is not always organic in its construction.           The spirals are placed
side by side, they do not grow the one out of the other.                And  I
submit that all patterns, to be good, must be organic in the relation
of their details and organic in the method of their development.
      The great schools of design which           I have thus attempted to
characterise are historical, and they are closed.          The future, as    I
have elsewhere had occasion to remark, is not, in my opinion, with
 them or their developments or repetition, however much the present
 may occupy itself with their corrected iteration.
      Design is invention and development, and when development has
 reached a certain point the invention is exhausted and some new
departure must be taken.              No new departure, however, of any
 importance has taken place since the close of the great schools of
 France of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and the decoration
 of bound books is still an open problem awaiting solution at the
 hands of genius.
      But though the problem awaits solution the conditions of the
 problem may,       I think, be stated shortly in general terms. In the
 first place,  then,  there must be in any design a scheme or framework
 of distribution.      The  area  to be covered must be covered according
 to   some  symmetrical plan.         In the second place, the scheme or
 framework of distribution must itself be covered by the orderly
 repetition, and if need be, modification and development of some
 primary element of decoration.         In the great French schools which
 I have attempted to describe, the motifs were primarily curved or
 straight bands or lines, and compartments composed of the same,
 the whole pattern of the first school becoming, in principle, the
 motifs of the second and third.
      Before leaving this subject of design         I  may be permitted to
 prophesy   that   in the infinite  inventions of  Nature herself will, in the
 future as in the past, be found the suggestions of design, and that in
 seeking them there the craftsman artist will enter again into that
 vital communion with her which is the condition at once of his own
 happiness and of his own imaginative growth.              But the prophecy
 must be accompanied by this caution — design cannot, in my opinion,

184            Mr. T.   J.   Cobden-Sanderson   on Bookbinding.          [Feb. 2,
be taught.   It is as distinctly a gift of imaginative genius as the
power of poetical vision and expression.     To the conditions of the
problem, then, must be added the genius suitable for its solution.
      I
      have now, in conclusion, to say what, in my opinion, the craft of
the binder is, and in what relation it stands to the supreme art and
craft of life itself.
     All this universe of light and shade and sound, which at all
moments surrounds us, and constitutes the supreme object of man's
thoughts, his intranscendant inner and outer self, may be looked
upon as itself a work of art in progress, and man's life through the
ages as an attempt, ever renewed, to apprehend it in its entirety, and
to reduce it to something appreciable by his imagination and his
affections.     This is not the moment to dwell at length upon this
attempt, or to show how, with increasing knowledge of his environ
ment, his previous conceptions of it have perished to give birth to
higher and wider appreciations ; but                     I
                                                may allege that, in my
opinion, all the religions which have figured upon the stage of
history, as well as all philosophical and scientific systems, are
attempts at this reduction of the universe and of man as a part of                    it,
to an entirety harmonious within itself, and fit to be the dwelling
place of the imaginative soul of mankind.          They are attempts, and
for some of us they have ceased to be adequate. For myself,            see   I
only unbounded space and infinite time, and within those illinri tables,
a  finite world obedient to law, unfolding to unknown ends and                ;
though    I   cannot grasp that world in its entirety, yet      can divine
                                                                  I
the amplitude of its rhythm, be sensitive to its adaptations and to
the balance of its parts, and, in the spirit of the infinitely great, work
at the infinitely little, and feel the two akin in their adjustments,
balance and rhythm.
     It   isin this intuition of the harmony of the universe that the
ideal of the work of the hand resides.         It itself an adjustment,
                                                             is
at once beautiful and serviceable.      It is dedication of man's powers
                                                     a
to an end not beyond man's reach              develops invention and tho
                                                ;   it
imaginative faculties        distracts the mind from the vexed question,
                              ;   it
never wholly to be put aside, of man's own ultimate destiny                       ;   it
gives him rest     ;   gives him hope, that even as from the work of his
                        it
own hands here there arise things of beauty and of use, so from his
whole life's work there may arise in the " hereafter," which in some
sense may be only another form of the " present,"            something of
                                                                  a
even greater use and greater beauty still.

                         Bacon's Key to Nature.
No English writer of equal eminence is so inadequately known
by the mass of his countrymen as Lord Bacon. Every man and
woman of culture is more or less familiar with the Essays : few have
                          '
turned ten pages of         Organum,'   glanced at the ' De Sapientia
Veterum,' or ventured into one grove of the ' Sylva Sylvarum.'       Save
as a writer of fine sentences, Bacon has been generally judged by
Pope's lampooning line, Lord Campbell's shallow summary, and
the farthest adrift of Lord Macaulay's estimates. The moral charges
brought against him are at least plausible, though often gross,
exaggerations, but the popular travesty of his system set forth by
his most eloquent English critic is ludicrous.      The writer's diffuse-
ness of illustration permits the whole gist of fifty bright and delusive
                                              Macaulay, " was neither a
                               " Bacon," says
pages to be given in two.
philosopher nor a logician, but a reformer.       The peculiarity of his
work lay in the fact of its object being altogether different from any
which his predecessors had proposed.      They had wasted their dialectic
on labours like those spent on a treadmill. He strove not to solve
enigmas, but to enrich man's estate.    The ancient philosophy disdained
to be useful, and was content to be stationary.       The reviewer finds
on the tree which Socrates planted and Plato watered, flowers but no
fruit. To the revolving questions of the Schools he answers, " Cur
quis non prandeat hoc est."
                                " The aim of Plato," he concludes, " was
to exalt man into a god ; that of Bacon, to supply him with what
he wants as a man.     The one drew a good bow, but shot at the stars ;
the other fixed his eye on a common target, and hit it in the white.
While the world was resounding with doctrinal disputes, the traitorous
friend and pure philanthropist (!), leaving the windy war to those
who liked it, was content to add to the sum of human happiness."
Macaulay often talks of the absolute originality of the ' Novum
Organum,' of the new era it opened up, but, in flat contradiction of
himself, he asserts in his essay that the author's benevolent aim
was the sum and substance of his philosophy.          The notion that he
invented a new method of arriving at truth by induction ho takes

190                           Profenor Nichol                      [Feb. 16,
to be about as well founded as that of the people who, in the middle
ages, imagined that Virgil was a great conjuror.
     Induction has been practised since the beginning of the world, by
every human being.        The Inductive method had been long before
analysed by Aristotle ; but it is an analysis of that which we are all
doing from morning till night.         The man who infers that mince pies
have disagreed     with him,  because    he was ill when he ate them, well
when he ate them not,     most    ill when  he ate most, and least ill when
he ate least,   has employed   all  the Tables  of the ' Novum Organum.'
      In the always superficial, generally second-hand view of Bacon's
 work thus condensed, there are two flagrant defects : —
      1. It is an impudent travesty of the Greek schools.
      2. Stating, only with partial accuracy, what Bacon actually
 achieved, it leaves us with hardly any conception of what he intended
 to do.    He was no mere Empiric ; an observer and experimentalist, he
 was also a Philosopher, animated by a spirit far less removed from
 that of the ancient thinkers than Macaulay imagines it to have been.
      On the theme of Bacon's relation to the " old age" which he calls
 " the youth of the world," we can afford       space but for a few explana
 tory paragraphs.      He was born in an era of mental revolution and
 shared to the full its enthusiasms, its inspiration and its excesses.
 The great political liberal Conservative of his generation, he was on
 matters more purely speculative the great Innovator.                In his
 youthful tractates he arraigns the most illustrious of his predecessors
 with an audacity which he himself compares to that of Alexander,
 and in language which recalls Milton's railing at Salmasius.            No
 part of Bacon's plan is more definite than his determination to break
 with the Past, though no part of it was more incompletely fulfilled.
 To the last, while dreaming dreams of a Utopia almost as ideal as
  Plato's Republic, he yet himself was more than half an Aristotelian,
  and constructed the world out of Categories to which he gave the
 name of Forms.
       The motto prefixed to the ' Instauratio,' " Multi pertransibunt et
  augebitur scientia," with the suggestion on its frontispiece of Colum
  bus and Drake, is as far as possible removed from the rcAo? TtXeiov of
 a Sophoclean     play or an Aristotelian State. But he himself stood on
  the confines of two worlds, and while consciously pressing toward the
  future, was still unconsciously influenced by the spirit of the past.
  His Ethics and Politics were largely those of the Greeks, and none
 among his predecessors was more satisfied of having solved a problem
 and found a key.        The Greeks and their mediaeval copyists had
 mixed Physics and Metaphysics.           Bacon failed to disentangle them,
 confused a priori    and a posteriori  truths, and hoped to deal with them
 by a single method.      The   injustice  of his criticisms would therefore
 seem to be doubled ; but he lived in an uncritical age, an age of

  creation rather than analysis, of conquest more than appreciation, and
  his aim made it impossible for him to realise that of the earlier
  thinkers even had they come down to him less obscured by the
  mists of commentary.       A Declaration of Rights against the greatest
  thinkers of Greece was the signal of sixteenth century indepen
  dence. The modern student of philosophy sees a chain of thought
  in all the schools : they lean on those that went before, and make
  some advance as they roll, like tides, after one another ; but this
  advance is unconscious.      Each new philosopher seems to have found
  the secret of the earth, and proclaimed it with a religious zeal.
      How little has modern Europe added to the pure speculation of
  the Greeks 1 How little of physical discovery has Greece bequeathed
  to modern Europe I There is no greater contrast in history than
  such sterility and such luxuriance.        The ancients had no instru
  ments to work with but language and logical forms.               They had
  hardly any notion of what we mean by a law of nature, and only
  thought of law as an idea. The same causes that retarded progress on
  one side, during the ages of antiquity, retarded it on every side during
  those succeeding, in which the world seemed to re-enact its childhood.
 Scholasticism had turned away from Nature : to the study of which
 Bacon first, with sufficient eloquence, recalled men's minds.          He
 himself had, in a sense, less claim to the title of a physical philoso
 pher than Roger Bacon, who is said to have made gunpowder, while
 Francis thought the courage of soldiers might be increased by eating
 it. He calls Copernicus that cabman who drives the earth about,
 and expresses a wish that the Italian astronomers would give up
their stargazing.
                                      II.
      The   mass  of Analysis and Criticism accumulated about the
 Baconian philosophy still leaves room for difference of opinion as to
 its degree of inaccuracy in detail and failure in direct result, for
doubt regarding many of the beliefs of its author, recorded with
frequent inconsistency and some confusion in so many various tenta
tive forms ; but there is no room for rational difference as to its
design, which was to explore the Universe, and under constant protest
of reverence for the mysteries of Faith, to make men its masters.
     Bacon's audacity was native to the times in which he was born.
All the features, bright and dark, of our Elizabethan age — its splen
dour, the wearisomeness of its intrigue, in chief its daring — are con
spicuously reflected in his career. The hundred years preceding had
all over Europe been rife in changes, changes in moment hardly
approached during the interval since the assertion of Greek inde
pendence.      So much was going out, so much coming in, that the
previously   established   order of things seemed like an unsubstantial
pageant.     Men's   minds   were dazzled and their fancies inflamed at
the opening of the gates of the modern world.        The age was adventur

  192                         Professor Nichol                [Feb. 16,
 was ready to approve ; but he was the first fully to recognise its
 increasing purpose.    It was an age at once of scepticism and of
 credulity. When a new world of fact, so full of authentic marvels,
 had been so suddenly revealed, to doubt regarding a new marvel
 seemed as unnatural as it would now seem to accept it. The image
 in the 'De Augmentis' of the child emerging from Plato's cave
 applies, in a way scarce intended, to the great actor of the time, and
 to the great thinker himself.     When the memory of the Incas was
 fresh, what wonder that the former was lured from his manor and
 home fields to seek the Eldorado, whose battlements seem to gleam
 through the arch of experience ; or that the other rose from the
 study of Paracelsus and Agricola to lay the foundations of a new
 Atlantis, where the coarser metals might be transmuted into gold
 " by superinducing the ' forms ' of the precious ore. Similarly,
 while modern History and Science were yet in infancy, long ere
 Specialism had made havoc of
                                     " the grand style," it was by an
 equally characteristic and natural audacity that the one essayed to
 bring together the records of all the nations, while the other aspired
                                           "
to catalogue the " Phenomena Universi        and to supply an Organum
" to storm and occupy the castles and strongholds of the Nature of
Things."
     During   the last thirty years of the sixteenth century, the
Renaissance and the Reformation met and were blended in the
writings of Sidney, Hooker, Spenser, Marlow, Shakespeare, Raleigh
and Bacon.     Liberty was still restrained within jealously guarded
bounds, but there was emancipation enough to bring with it the feeling
of a freer atmosphere; after a feverish night men breathed the
morning, and social peace was the more secure that it was the calm
of a sky cleared by storms. There was time to look before and after,
to read Drayton's poetical antiquities, and the well-languaged Daniel,
to weave a more gorgeous web out of the cycle of Arthurian Romance,
and lay down a new scheme for interpreting Nature.
     What then was Bacon's central Idea, and how far was it capable
of realisation ? To these questions we must now confine ourselves.
He has been accepted as an often incisive critic and a keen observer.
His own idea of his position was that of a discoverer of a mundus alter
et idem, a new world of more moment to mankind than the Indies of
Columbus.     He would have received with indignation the verdict
that his work was mainly negative, that he would be known to the
future by his incidental wisdom and commended by rhetoricians for
his popular aims. He arraigned the thinkers of the Past because he
fancied himself to have found what they had missed. He assailed
their love of system because he had a supplanting system. He
despised their a priori views because, by the exercise of an imagina
tion almost Shakespearian in its daring, he conceived to have
banished from the future of the physical drama all need for further
imaginings.    Nowhere do we find a more exalted conception of Nature
than in his pages, but he holds it as a cardinal doctrine that she is

finite, that the time is at hand when all essential knowledge may be
grasped, the world well won, and the age of the Garden before the Fall
restored.
     Bacon insists that we must enter the Kingdom of Nature sub
persona infantis, but he has himself the air of one taking possession of
a throne.    He had little of the submissive spirit which led Newton to
confess himself " a child gathering pebbles on the shore of the infinite
sea," or that of the modern poet, " moving about in worlds not
realised."    His always proud humility lay in his acceptance of the
                              '
dictum of the ' Parmenides       that the least of Nature's manifestations
is worthy of our note : but his aspirations as a thinker dwarfed his
ambition as a statesman.       By every image at command, of a fancy
among the masters of prose equalled by Plato alone, he impresses us
with his belief in his possession of a clue, a KEY, a secret, that had
come to him by a sort of inspiration. He had unlocked the door
                                                                           "

from the modern " Correlation of Forces         and conjectures as those of
Leibnitz and Moscow itch on the borderland where physics seem to
merge into metaphysic.          Like the earliest recorded thinkers of
Greece, Bacon founded his Unity on Examination of the External world
rather than on a Mental Analysis.          He accepts the conclusions of
neither Thales    nor Heraclitus ;  but  he holds that in looking behind
appearances to some physical basis into which the shows of the
Universe may be resolved, they were on a path more fruitful than the
impossible attempt to separate non-existent substances from attributes,
or paradigms from realities.         He is as ready as any Greek or
German to admit that " things are not what they seem ; but, setting

aside the inscrutable truths of religion, he has no faith in anything
that is not physical.   His " noumena " are " phenomena " interrogated
and explained ; Proteus grappled with through every alias till he
returns to his proper shape ; Heat confessing itself to be an expansive
motion.    In dealing as with the ultimate Nature of things Bacon
suggests rather than dogmatises; hazarding the view that all the
assumed elements may be reduced to one, as has been imagined by
chemists like Samuel Brown, who have tried to establish what the
alchemists vaguely guessed.       Bacon is nowhere bold enough to assert
with Pythagoras, that all apparent varieties of quality are resolvable
into arrangements of form ; but he feels confident in having gono

 Think how many colours may be made out of various combinations
of the three called primary.       May it not be possible to resolve even
these last by processes analogous to those which analyse the secondary ?
Look at the combinations in a laboratory — the manufacture of an
apparent diamond out of a block of coal. How many shapes may
result from the arrangement of, say, six solid factors ! How many
more if these factors are fluid ? Is there anything strange in the
belief that everything that strikes any of our senses may be resolved

which we are surrounded, is thus at once the " garment of God and
the heritage of man. Man is, with Bacon, " the roof and crown of
things," and his view of the relation of the chief of creatures to the
rest of creation is expressed in the verse of his friend and coadjutor
in translation, George Herbert, —
            " For us the winds do blow,
              The earth doth rest, heaven move and fountains flow.
              Man is  one world and hath
              Another to attend him."
    In the same spirit Bacon protests against the old preference of
Passive to Active Life, of the /Ji'os OtwpriTiKos to the /Ji'os 7rpaKTiKos, as
in the famous passage about Pompey saying, " It is necessary for me
to serve the State while      I live, not for me to live longer," and the
         of                to Hiero,  " At the Olympian
speech       Pythagoras                                     games there are
mere spectators, but in this theatre of man's life it is reserved only
for God and Angels to be lookers on." This is Bacon's Philan-
thropia : like Socrates he thought it his prime duty to inquire into
the agencies which most affect human life and happiness ; but he
wished to find general and not special agencies. Against nothing
does Bacon record more frequent and strenuous protests than the
mere Empirical Utilitarianism with which he has been calumniously
credited.    " It is a corrupt judgment," he exclaims, " to think that
there are no true differences of things, but according to utility."

  advocacy of Freedom of Speech in the Areopagitica.'          Nowhere does
  Bacon, in the forefront of his age, more suggest the thought that
  while morning broke on all statues alike, Memnon alone made music
  in reply. Nowhere does he assert himself as an orator of science
  more persuasive if not greater than Leonardo or Galileo ; nowhere
  has he given more conclusive answers to the imputation of narrow if
  not sordid utilitarianism, preferred against his name by those who
  have taken it to their market without more than a glance at his
  work.
       1. The ' Advancement of Learning,' expanded into the ' De Aug
  ments,' fulfils as adequately as was possible for one man to do at
  that age, the promise of the first part of his Instauration, the
  " Partitiones Scientiarum."     They constitute a Diorama of Science,
  practical and speculative, as known up to his time. With numerous
  errors, they abound in wise reflections and countless suggestions, and
  argument for endless comment, on which we cannot here touch.
      2. In logical if not actual order, the Second Part was meant to be
 a Catalogue of all the facts of Nature under the title of " Phenomena
  Dniversi," which Bacon thought might be made complete, but to which
                                                   '

      3. Thirdly we have the ' Novum Organum           itself.
      4 and 5. Two other fragmentary parts give examples of its
 working.
      6. To the last, the Philosophy itself, the future progress of Science
 has been making gradual contributions.
      I can only say a few words about the Organum.
      After some introductory aphorisms, Bacon dwells on the defects
 inherent in man's own nature, errors of sense and of the understanding.
 He then proceeds to arrange the prepossessions or mental disturbing
 causes under the famous four heads of Idola.           These being so well
 known to Macaul ay's schoolboy, merely call for enumeration.            On
 the threshold of inquiry we encounter those phantoms of the mind,
 Theatri, reverence for Aristotle and the other misled and misleading
schools which he again in detail arraigns ; Fori, common talk and
public opinion ; Specus, a lawyer's or politician's bias which he had to
encounter in dealing with Coke and Cecil ; last, Tribus, the infusion
 of the passions and the affections that coloured the dry light in his
own as in all minds.       These are the Idola, which are to Science as
formal fallacies are to Logic, the prima facie pitfalls in the way, the
duties of omission in Natural Philosophy. It is evident that they
may either act together or separately in the same mind and in refer
ence to the same thing.        If I  say the sun moves round the earth
because my eyes tell me so, it is an Idolum tribus ; if because language
takes it for granted, it is an Idolum fori ; because Ptolemy says so, it
is an Idolum theatri ; because that view agrees with other theories of

196                        Professor Nichol                    [Feb.   16,
my own, it is an Idolum specus. When those spectres are laid the
way is clear for unbiassed investigation.
     Having got all the facts that are, about the object of my research,
I   have next to range them under three Tables : (1) of Affirmatives
containing a collection of all the known instances that agree in
having the same quality, e.g. to take Bacon's example, of all bodies
that give forth heat.     (2) of Negatives, a collection of examples of
bodies otherwise similar (else the list would be endless) which do not
agree in the same nature, i.e. which do not give out heat.    A main use
of this table is to discover the nature sought by observing qualities
absent in the analogous nature. Thus boiling water is hot, ice is cold,
living bodies are hot, dead bodies are cold ; but in boiling water and
in living bodies there is motion of parts, in ice and dead bodies they
are fixed. Does it not seem, therefore, that motion of parts is of the
nature of heat ? The stress Bacon lays on Negative Instances is the
first clear assertion of the principle " Audiatur et altera pars
                                                                     " in
Philosophy, and he uses it quaintly of superstitions, in the question,
Where are the tablets hung of those that perished with their vows ?
The employment of this table along with the first corresponds to the
" Joint Method of Agreement and Difference " in modern Logic.
                                                                      (3)
While the use of the third, that of Majus and Minus, more or less
intensity of the quality, is Mill's " Method of concomitant Variations."
     So far all is plain.  The use of these Tables is in the main modern
Induction.     There is wanting only the recognition of Theory, of
Hypotheses as a motive and principle of arrangement ; nor is Bacon
without a vague idea of the value of shrewd conjecture, which he
expresses under the name of Vindemiatio Prima or Permissio Intel-
lectus, i.e. an indulgence to the understanding to gather early grapes.
     Meanwhile he throws into his Table of Exclusions everything about
Heat which is not present in the affirmatives, present in the negative,
everything which increases when the phenomenon decreases and vice
versa.   The conclusion drawn from this as regards Heat, not so far
astray as critics, to whom detail is everything, have assumed, is yet
partly a guess. Bacon had worked up to the modern canon of Residues,
but he failed properly to npply    it, for of his Prerogative Instances,
meant as severer tests, he has only given " a few illustrations."     He
was hurried away by the very impatience, misled by the same love of
uniformity which in his predecessors he had denounced. Above all
he had set before himself an impracticable design.         He thought he
could put labels on the whole of Nature.       He did not know by how
many parts her subtilty passes the subtilty of the human mind, or
how many new instruments were needed to wring her secrets from
her tenacious grasp and his lists are often a jumble of things great
                    ;
and small ;   his instances and conclusions, medleys of shrewd sug
gestion and almost childish fancies.        Like Galileo, he maintained
that Nature must be interpreted like     a  book, that we must learn the
alphabet — though far longer than he knew— before arranging the
facts of an Historia Naturalis, but the Induction which would have

given to the Table of Exclusions their conclusive force, was impossible ;
and his Forms were evasive.
      A few words only on these two heads, before a closing summary
of his work and its results. It goes without saying that Macaulay's
travesty and that of his Philistine centurions is a consummate
ignoratio elenchi.     Like the chamberlain in Tennyson's " Day Dream,"
he dallied with his golden chime and " smiling put the question by."
To confound the instinctive induction of all ages with the inductive
process is to contend that because the burnt dog dreads the fire, it is
idle to inquire into the nature of heat, or that mensuration and
trigonometry are useless because for practical purposes a man can
divine the height of most maypoles with his eyes and the breadth of
 most fields with his legs.
      As irrelevant is the criticism that Bacon's Method was latent in
 his Age. So no doubt the law of gravity was latent in the age of Newton
 and the steam engine in the age of Watt.                   The characteristic of
 originality is to be first born in the new thought.
      Yet more absurd is the contention that Bacon had          been forestalled.
 We might     as well assert that Newton was anticipated by the ancients
because they recorded the phenomenon of attraction.               The Induction
of Socrates was a mere process of leading the mind to moral convic
 tions by the use of Example and Analogy. Plato's view comes nearer
 to our own ; but his progress is from thought to higher thought, not
 from Observation to Law. Aristotle's Induction is a mere summary
 reasserting of the whole that which had previously been asserted of
all the parts. Bacon's deals with facts so as to elicit a law out of
 them : it is a process of discovery and yet in a sense geometrical,
 as it would give to the old inductive syllogism an immense and
 in point of fact impossible extension.

fails because the list of negatives can never be complete. It was
 something, as he asserts, which had never been attempted before, but
it  was also something which will never be attempted again.               Recent
 induction — that of Mill, Whewell, Herschel, Faraday and Darwin —
 is the means by which the great sequences of Nature, called Laws, are
 investigated by the aid of apt conjecture, and by careful verification
 established.    But Bacon thought to accomplish more than this. By
 aid of a Method, which, from its exhaustiveness, he held to be as
 certain in its results as a demonstration of Euclid, so mechanical that
 when once understood all men might employ it, yet so startling that
 it was to be a new sun to the borrowed beams of stars, he aspired to
 penetrate into the inner nature of things and so hold them in com
mand.

supreme and ultimate objects of bis research.                        They are, he says,
related to effects when permanent qualities, as efficient causes are to
events, and as aids to their discovery he introduces his conception
of the latent Schematism or invisible structure of bodies as crystals
revealed by cleavage, and the latent or secret process by which
changes are brought about, as the process which takes place in a seed
or an egg, before the appearance of the plant or chick.
     Bacon himself approaches the subject of his Forms, with the same
sort of deference as Plato does his Idea of Good, and endeavours to
illustrate his conception with all sorts of Imagery.                       It is neither
mere shape nor an abstract idea, nor a modern law of Nature, which
is merely the register of a great fact. As regards the name, be says
" It seemeth best to keep way with antiquity ' usque ad aras ' and
therefore to retain the ancient terms, though                  I  often alter the uses."
He does     not  perceive     that  in   retaining    the  old   names   he drags along
with them a part         of the   old   conceptions.       His   Form   is  to the shows
of things as    inner    to  outer,   it   is  the  "  very thing," having the same
relation   to the  so-called     primary qualities as they have to the second
ary, the  hidden    nature     arrived    at from the concrete manifestation.          He
regards every complex body            as  a turma or congeries of simple qualities
which we can ascertain by analysis, as it were breaking down the
less known species into a better known genus and differentia.                          As
Heat   is resolved     into  a  specific     sort  of  motion,   so  he holds   it is pos
sible to reduce all phenomena to combinations of simple elements,
which we may recombine and superinduce on various substances, and
so become the minister as well as the interpreter of Nature.
     Bacon constantly approaches great discoveries as with a divining
rod, and then passes them by.                  Astronomers, he says, in the ' Do
Augmentis,'
                 " have brought a beautiful hide but stuffed with straw."
They    have  arranged      skilful systems to resolve the visible phenomena
into circular movements, but they have neglected to ask the cause of
the phenomena.           The interior of the ox (namely the physical reason)
is wanting ; out of which (with the help of hypotheses) a theory
might be devised, which would not merely satisfy the phenomena,
but would set forth the substance, motion and influence of the
heavenly bodies as they really are.                 This is precisely what Newton,
working on the data of Kepler, really did ; and, in a subsequent para
graph, Bacon, suggesting that the discovery is to be made by
obtaining information of heavenly things from those seen amongst
ourselves, comes still nearer in his anticipation.                 But he rarely "dips
into the future," without immediately reverting to the past. He
recedes from his guess as to the method by which the law of gravity
was finally established, to the impossible Tables of Speusippus at the
base and an Ixion-like embrace of the golden clouds which shrouded
the apex of his unaccomplished                    pyramid.       He sought to solve
mysteries which Matnro by no torture or binding of Proteus has ever
been forced to reveal.          To ask the meaning of her primitive qualities
is to batter at the last gate of Spenser's Busiris, bearing the inscription

 their triumphs in large measure to the self-restraint which led men
 first to ascertain facts without any inquiry after their cause. Bacon's
 Tables including those of moral as well as physical conditions, tables of
 Anger, Hate, Love, as well as of Density, Heat, Cold, exceed the error
 of such of his partial successors as Comte and Buckle, in ignoring the
 peculiarly complex action, if not the absolute freedom, of the human
 will. Knowledge of the mental powers is a sort of experience ; His
 tory an observation on mankind ; Education an experiment ; but the
 uniformity of Nature does not hold good in the same degree in the
 Moral as in the Physical world.
      Bacon overestimated the precision of his Method, in comparing it
 to a pair of compasses, so that, once in possession of            all intellects
                                                                     it,

 centuries of the work of ants. Macaulay's criticism             here just. No

 His numerous minor errors have been sufficiently indicated.                They
 are no more frequent than might have been expected from the wide
 grasp of his mind, his antithetical temper and combative iconoclasm,
 and from the abnormal faculty of finding analogies which led him to
 snatch unripe apples from the tree of wisdom.              No man can leap
 beyond his own shadow     ;    hardly one beyond the shadow of his age.

attacks on the syllogism by reasserting its analytic value                     ;of

their little worlds of mere physicists, who dislike his metaphysical

worst, he has received from scientific and literary men of larger
grasp the crown of the great anticipator of the results, the first
organiser of the methods of modern science, the prophet of things
that Newton revealed.          Heis   commended by Descartes as the man
who knew best how to make experience useful                by Gassendi as the

a   new philosophy.       Leibnitz conceived his own Monadism to be akin
to the doctrine of the " De Principiis," and asserted, " We do well to
think highly of Yerulam, for his hard sayings have in them deep mean       a
ing." Kant alludes to Bacon's work as that of one of the greatest physi
cists of modern times. Laplace refers to him as " the brightest man of

nounces the day."         Mackintosh declares " his authority willyiiave no
end."     Mill, marking his lacunae, reveres his name. Whewell, who
                                                                 /

sets  it on the forefront of his comprehensive survey, and the lamented
Tyndall,    with literary graces only less unique than those of his
master, are at one with historians like Hallam in proclaiming him
the first mover in a mighty impulse.
     Bacon's self-criticism is sound, " Fungar vice cotis acutum reddere
qua) ferrum valet expers ipsa secandi."      He sharpened the instruments
for others to use ; he pointed the path which he could not follow,
to the walls of the citadel he failed to storm. His claim to have
moved     the intellects that move the world does not rest alone on
his forecasts of discovery.      He opened a way to " unpathed waters,
undreamed shores," by training his contemporaries to habits of ob
servation which he first set on a rank of equal dignity with abstract
thought.      He invented nothing, but he called the Sciences back to
their sources, and so, in the phrase of Remusat,
                                                      " threw out a thought
full of the future."     His predecessors spoke in lower tones.       It was
only Bacon's enthusiasm, through half a century maintained, his
dauntless tenacity and his splendid powers of speech that first gave
to modern science wings to make way through the minds of men.
     Nor Leonardo nor Galileo had his far-ranging view of the Unity
of Nature and of Science, or of the ultimate consilience of knowledge
and practical power.      His rubric was " all things by scale to unity."
His perception of analogies, however " portentous," led him right in
tracing a nexus in the scheme of things.        Bacon reflects and repeats
the old vague efforts in the same direction, from Heraclitus's finer fire,
the start and goal of the way up and down, to Plato's Triads ; from
the speculations on phenomena and noumena that ran through the
period from Xenocrates to Zeno, to the metaphysical paradigms of
the mediaeval realibts, physically realised in Owen's archetypal skeleton.
But, with all its uncritical want of precision, his own view is no mere
summary : it is a real, though sometimes shadowy premonition of the
later discoveries that have linked together, under the conception of
the " Correlation of Forces," the polarity of magnetism, the spark of
electricity, the affinity of chemical elements and of crystalline poles,
the unification of heat, light and picture-rendering rays as undulations
of the universal air.
     Similar conceptions are embodied in Schelling's " Harmonies of
Nature " and the comprehensive anticipation of Hegel, " Magnetism
                                                               "
is the universal act of investing multiplicity with unity ; but they
 are nowhere clad in such imaginative reality as in Bacon's extension
 of the world by the revelation of an unseen universe, a Fairyland of
 Science in which " we are citizens of no mean city."
     The epochs of Comte revolve, but in widening circles, as the
 positive again merges in the religious. The Greeks followed a
 mirage of the land they never reached.       The forces of Nature address
 the child   in images  and myths ;  Heaven    lies about him, because his
 fancies  do  not transcend  the dome  of blue  ; and he sees in the twilight
 the celestial gates.    The stars to him are gods, and make a sphery
 chime.     Later, "the intellectual power through words and things

pursues its dim and perilous way         to the same goal, and nature once
more appears as the garment of divinity.         The world is one ; " one
                    "
law, one element      is the first utterance and the last, the Alpha and
Omega of philosophy; but at the close the fictitious has been ex
changed for the real, when Faith, Fancy and Truth are blended in a
higher metaphysics.
     These ideas are common to Bacon with other theorists.              He
stands by himself in his belief in being able to make them live. His
philosophy is no Oiwpia or dream ; but a ministration to the wants
of the mankind he loved with a philanthropy often inconsistent with
personal devotion.     With him knowledge alone had no satiety ; in age,
when the Loves are changed into the Graces, he ran the race as in the
heyday, never feeling the weariness of Faust, and only at times the
suave mart magno.       His philosophy has its concrete presentation in
the ' Now Atlantis,' that rises from the sea in our memories, like
Prospero's Isle, the most practical and among the most poetic of the
anticipations of the future.      It is an allegory of his fragmentary
work : and, in closing the records of his varied life, we linger on the
sound of the sea rippling by the beach of its richly coloured shore.
Its details may be faulty, its design is prophetic ; nor in Plato or
Augustine, nor in More or Sidney, Campanella or Milton is there so
much sympathy with our increasing purpose, combined with so much
sense of its limitations.   Bacon never soars away from life, he realises
its complexity, its temptations and the indefinite range of its aggro-
gate power.     Like Shakespeare, he " puts a girdle round the world,"
                             "
and has left a name not to point a moral or adorn a tale," but to be a
beacon as well as a warning from one who, in a sense of the infanti
perduti, has also been among the eternal benefactors of his race.

                      The Making   of a Modern Fleet.
 The special programme of war shipbuilding embodied in the Naval
 Defence Act of 1889 is now approaching its completion.            Of the
 seventy ships therein provided for, all except eight or nine will be
 completed and ready for service at the end of this month, when the
 five years' period contemplated in the Act will terminate.       The few
 remaining ships will then be far advanced, and in the Navy Esti
 mates for 1894-5 less than 300,000Z. will have to be provided for
 their completion.      What has been done constitutes an unprecedented
 feat, whether it be considered on the basis of expenditure, or in the
 addition made in a comparatively short time to the naval strength of
 the empire.     No other country in the world could rival this perform
 ance, which furnishes an object lesson, on a large scale, of what has
 to be done whenever the making of a modern fleet is undertaken.
      Regarding the transaction from this point of view, the principal
 steps may be summarised as follows : —
      1. The selection of types, and the numbers of ships of each type
 to be built.
      2. The preparation of designs for each type, fulfilling the con
 ditions laid down for offensive and defensive powers, speed and coal
 endurance.
      3. The making of estimates of cost ; these estimates including
 the unit costs for each type ; the aggregate cost of the whole scheme ;
 and the incidence of expenditure on each year of the period of con
  struction.
      4. The allocation of orders, so that the actual construction of
 ships, machinery, and armaments may be completed within the stipu
 lated period.
      For ships of the Royal Navy, the Board of Admiralty is the
  responsible authority in the selection of types, and determination of
  the numbers to be built of each type. Since actual experience in
 modern naval warfare is almost entirely wanting, differences of opinion
  necessarily arise respecting the relative values of different types, the
  best methods of protection, the most suitable armaments, and other
  features of construction.     In the ancient fleet of unarmoured sailing
 vessels, long-continued      experience in actual war, associated with
 practical stagnation in the construction, armament and propulsion of

208                        Mr. William E. White                  [March 9,
war-ships, made the selection of types an easy matter.            Now the
progress of invention is rapid, and change follows fast upon change ;
so that the decision of fighting and sea-keeping qualities is a diffi
cult undertaking.     Whatever is done is certain to be challenged or
criticised.
     The Admiralty has many advantages in its action as a "Com
mittee on Designs."        On the Board are a number of experienced
and distinguished naval officers.     The largest war-fleet in the world
is under its orders, and from the service afloat come many reports,
suggestions, and records of experiment.      What is being done at home
and abroad in the construction and armament of ships ; the improve
ment of ordnance, ammunition, armour, torpedoes and other matters
of importance, is well known and carefully considered. Use is made
of the best engineering talent of the country in devising improved
types of propelling machinery, auxiliary mechanical appliances, gun-
mountings and other portions of the equipment.           When considered
desirable, distinguished naval and professional men are called into
council. But the final decision as to the characteristics and qualities
of each of Her Majesty's ships necessarily rests with the Admiralty.
     Universal experience in all navies and at all periods shows that
there must be a considerable variety of types in any fleet. No single
type can be trusted to perform all the services required at a given
moment.      Progress in invention and consequent change in type
necessarily introduces further variety.      Iron and steel-hulled ships
                            On the " Effective List of the Royal Navy
                                                     "
have great durability.
still remain specimens of the earliest sea-going ironclads, now over
thirty years old ; and examples of successive types which during
that long period have made their appearance as first-class ships, only
to pass gradually into lower classes and finally into the Reserve.
Obsolete as many of these vessels are in engines, guns and armour,
 they are practically as strong as they ever were. Should a war take
place, and serious engagements happen between the more modern
 ships on each side, it is quite conceivable that the so-called " obsolete
                                                                           "
ships of the Reserve may play an important part in the final stages
of the conflict.
      Apart from the variety of type produced by lapse of time, there
 is the variety arising from the necessities of service. By common
consent a modern fleet, like the ancient fleet, must have a squadron of
battle-ships as its back-bone.     With these must be associated cruisers
 of various kinds — the " eyes of the fleet " —and vessels of the torpedo
flotilla. Opinions differ as to the most suitable proportion of cruisers
 to battle-ships.   Some advocate three cruisers to each pair of battle
 ships  ; others  would   have two cruisers of different types to each
 battle-ship  ; and  others  consider that, to complete a group, there
 should be a battle-ship, two cruisers and a torpedo vessel.
      The Naval Defence Programme provided for seventy vessels : ten
 battle-ships, forty-two cruisers and eighteen torpedo gunboats.       Most
 of the designs were novol in character. Eight of the battle-ships are

 1894.]             on the Making of a Modern Fleet.                  209
 380 feet long and 14,150 tons in displacement.      They are the largest
completed ships in the Royal Navy, and the most powerfully armed.
Each vessel carries four 67-ton guns, ten 6-inch quick-firing guns
and twenty-eight small quick-firers for use against torpedo boats, as
well as in action with other ships. The maximum smooth-water
speeds are 17h to 18 knots.        In protection, armament, speed and
coal-supply they surpass all their predecessors.       The ships are of
high freeboard, carry their guns at a great height above water, and
are specially adapted for service in the Atlantic.
     Two of the battle-ships are of less dimensions : 360 feet in length
and of 10,500 tons displacement.        In speed and coal-supply they
compare well with the larger vessels. They are inferior in armament
and protection.     The heaviest guns are 29 tons each in weight, and
the largest quick-firers are 4* 7-inch.     These vessels were designed
especially for service on distant stations, and can pass through the
Suez Canal.
     There are four distinct types of cruisers.    Nine are of the first
class, 360 feet long and from 7350 to 7700 tons in displacement.
They have maximum speeds in smooth water of 20 to 21 knots, and
large coal supplies ; powerful armaments and good protection to
guns, gun crews and vitals.      The heaviest guns weigh 22 tons each,
and the main armament consists of ton 6-inch quick-firers, with
seventeen smaller guns.
     Twenty-nine vessels are second class cruisers, eight being of one
type and twenty-one of another type.        They are 300 to 320 feet in
length  and   3400  to 4400   tons  in displacement.    Their maximum
smooth water speeds are about 20 knots, and they have good coal
supplies.    The armaments include 6-inch and 4 * 7-inch quick-firers,
besides smaller guns, and they have fair protection.
    Four cruisers of the third class are 265 feet long and of 2600 tons
displacement. They are about a knot slower than the smaller second-
class cruisers, and not quite so well armed, but they are equal in
protection.
     Torpedo gunboats are of comparatively recent introduction, and
are the smallest sea-going vessels built to accompany fleets.          In
length they vary from 230 to 250 feet, in displacement from 750 to
1100 tons.     They have a light gun armament and a powerful torpedo
armament, the maximum smooth water speeds range from 19 to 20
knots.    Experience has proved them to be excellent sea-boats in the
heaviest weather.
     It will be noted that all these vessels are of high speed, and
capable of acting together as a fleet.         Further, that the Naval
Defence Programme provided not merely for the largest proportionate
number of cruisers to battle-ships above mentioned, but gave a con
siderable margin over and above those requirements available for
service in the protection of commerce or in other ways.        If a fully
constituted fleet were formed from the Naval Defence ships, including
all the battle-ships and the equivalent number of cruisers, it would

210                         Mr. William H. White                 [March 9,
surpass in speed and fighting power any equal number of completed
ships of similar classes that could possibly be brought against it
from existing navies.         Having been created rapidly and simul
taneously, it is more homogeneous in character and better equipped
for manoeuvring at high speed. Its armament, also, is of the most
modern description, being distinguished           by the preponderance of
quick-firing guns.        These guns can be fired about thrice as fast as
guns of equal calibre but earlier patterns, and the supplies of
ammunition have been proportionately increased.
      In the fleet 1342 guns are mounted. Of these 776 are 6-pounders
or under, and over 500 are 6-inch and 4 -7-inch quick-firers, while 56
are from 9*2 inch in the cruisers up to 13*5 inch in the large
battle-ships.
      Torpedo armaments, including submerged and above-water dis
 charges, are carried in all the ships, but are subordinated to the gun
 armaments, except in the torpedo gunboats.          There are 322 torpedo-
 ejecting tubes in the seventy ships.
      All the larger ships have their bows strengthened for ramming.
 That method of attack, however, involves special risks, particularly
 since torpedo armaments have been so considerably developed.
       Electric search-lights and internal lighting, net defences and all
 other means for protecting the ships against torpedo-boat attacks
 have been adopted in the larger cruisers and battle-ships.             The
 smaller cruisers and torpedo vessels have no net defences.
       Mechanical appliances of all kinds have been freely employed to
 reduce or assist manual labour. In habitability and sanitary arrange
 ments the ships surpass previous constructions.
       The aggregate total weight of the ships, fully equipped, exceeds
 335,000 tons ; the total power of the propelling engines, working
 under conditions of maximum development, is about 600,000 horse
 power.      This proportion of power to weight —averaging nearly two
 horse-power to each ton — is a clear proof of the relatively high speed
 of the Naval Defence fleet. Until ten or twelve years ago the
 maximum speeds of battle-ships in smooth water ranged from 14 to
  15 knots, and of swift cruisers from 15 to 17 knots. Comparing these
  figures with those given above for the Naval Defence ships, it will
  bo seen that a great stride has been made.        Improvements in marine
  engines   have  greatly  aided progress, but  there has necessarily been a
  considerable increase in engine-power.         As speeds increase, so does
  the rate of growth in expenditure of power increase most rapidly.
  A first-class battle-ship, for examplo, can be driven 10 knots an hour
  by 2000 horse-power.        At 14 knots 5500 horse-power is necessary ;
  at 18 knots, 13,500 horse-power.         To gain 4 knots from 10 knots
  means an increase of 3500 horse-power ; an equal gain in speed from
   14 knots involves an increase of 8000 horse-power.
       Modern ships depend solely upon steam propulsion, and are
  practically destitute of sail-power.         Their range of action and
  powor of keeping the sea depends, therefore, entirely upon their coal

1894.]                on the Making of a Modern Fleet.                 211
supplies and rate of coal consumption.       By the use of higher steam-
pressures and greater expansion the rate of coal consumption has
been greatly reduced in the last thirty years. A first-class battle
ship of 1860 required to burn about 5 to 5^ lbs. of coal per indicated
horse-power per hour, whereas a ship of similar class in the Naval
Defence fleet burns 2 to 2J lbs. only.
     On the other hand, in recent ships great demands are made on coal
for  various auxiliary purposes formerly non-existent. Large quantities
of sea water have to be distilled for use in the boilers. Internal
electric lighting makes considerable inroads on the coal. The multi
plication of auxiliary machinery for all purposes does the same, whereas
in earlier ships most of the operations now done by such machinery
were performed by manual power.
     Taking a broad view of the situation, it may be said that modern
ships have much larger coal endurance, and can steam over longer
distances.    When cruising at sea or making passages under ordinary
conditions war-ships proceed at moderate speeds.          Comparisons of
coal-endurances are, therefore, commonly made at the speed of 10
knots.     A battle-ship of the first class built in 1861 carried 750
tons of coal, and could keep the sea steaming continuously at 10
knots for six days.        She had auxiliary sail-power also, and could
economise coal under favourable circumstances of wind and weather.
 A first class battleship of the Naval Defence fleet leaves port with
nearly twice as much coal on board, and can steam continuously at
 10 knots for twenty to twenty-one days before her coal is exhausted.
She has no sail power ; her machinery and propellers are duplicated
for the sako'of greater safety against disablement and better utilisation
 of the engine-power at high speeds.
      The armaments of modern ships have been mado proportionately
 heavier, not so much in the way of increasing the weight of the most
 powerful guns, as by developing the secondary armaments of quick-
 firing guns and increasing the supplies of ammunition.         It will be
 remarked that the heaviest guns mounted in the Naval Defence fleet
 are 67 tons in weight, whereas preceding ships of less size carry
 110 ton guns.     Indeed, had there been a satisfactory 12-inch gun of
 about 50 tons available in 1889 it would probably have been adopted
 by preference.     Since that date such a gun has been produced, and
 has been made the principal armament of the Majestic class.
      A distinctive feature in recent battle-ships is the great power and
 efficient protection of the secondary armament of quick-firing guns.
 It is within the truth to say that with this portion of the armament
 alone, a ship of the Royal Sovereign class could make a good fight,
 having regard to the rapidity of fire and the energy of the projectiles.
 A 6-inch quick-firing gun delivering five or six aimed projectiles per
 minute, with energies sufficient to perforate a foot of iron armour
 at close range, is clearly a formidable weapon.
      Armour protection in the Naval Defence ships has been most care
  fully considered. No other feature in war-ship construction has given

212                          Mr. William H. White               [March    9,
rise to greater controversies than the proper method of disposing the
armour.      On the whole the system adopted in 1889 has given general
satisfaction.     It involves large proportionate weights and costs. On
a ship like the Royal Sovereign the thick vertical armour weighs
about 3000 tons, and costs over a quarter of a million sterling.
     Great improvements in armour have been made in recent years,
increasing its defensive power for a given thickness and weight.       But
in view of remarkable developments in explosives and ordnance there
is no disposition to diminish weights of armour on battle-ships.         In
fact increased protection to secondary armaments involves greater
weights in proportion to displacements.
     Since modern war-ships have higher speeds, greater coal supplies,
more powerful armaments, and better protection, it is inevitable
that they should be of greater size and cost than their prede
cessors.      In the mercantile marine, also, the demands for higher
speeds or greater carrying power have involved considerable enlarge
ment of dimensions and additional first cost.       The largest passenger
and cargo steamers, as a matter of fact, exceed in dimensions and
displacements the largest battle-ships and cruisers.      Their costs are
less than those of the war-ships, because they are much less elabo
rately fitted and carry no armaments. On the Trans-Atlantic service
there are employed passenger steamers from 625 to 600 feet in
length, and from 15,000 to 20,000 tons displacement.          The largest
battle-ships yet      laid down  for the Royal Navy — the Majestic class —
are 390 feet long and of 14,900 tons displacement.            The largest
cruisers —the Powerful class —are 500 feet long and of 14,200 tons
 displacement.      Analysing the designs of war-ships, and comparing
 them with merchant ships — as far as comparisons are reasonable
 between vessels built for entirely different services — one is forced
 to the conclusion that the sizes and cost of recent war-ships are rela
 tively moderate.
     If   size and cost are to be reduced, as some persons strongly
 urge,  then   it will be absolutely necessary to reduce some or all of
 the qualities associated in the designs of the large ships ; to accept
 lighter guns, less weight of protection, lower speeds, or lessoned
 coal supplies.       In other words, to produce fighting machines of
 smaller individual power, comparing badly with the ships of most
 recent design built or building abroad. There would be no difficulty,
 of course, in producing a larger number of less powerful ships for a
 given expenditure.        But it would be a new departure in British
 naval policy to deliberately accept individual inferiority in our ships
 to foreign ships for the purpose of securing greater numbers.       If the
 necessary expenditure is faced, superiority in numbers as well as in
•the powers of individual ships can be secured ; and the weight of
 public and professional opinion undoubtedly inclines to that side.
     If  the constitution of the Naval Defence fleet is considered, it will
 be noted that only the ten battle-ships are really of large dimensions,
 out of the total number, seventy. This is an illustration of general

1894.]              on the Making of a Modern Fleet.                   213
practice, although the advocates of moderate dimensions frequently
proceed on the hypothesis that only large ships are built. As a
matter of interest the ships built or building from my designs, since
I took office in 1885, have been classified. Out of a total of 131 ships,
only 15 are above 10,000 tons in displacement, 12 from 7000 to 9000
tons, 46 from 2500 to 5600 tons, 11 from 1000 to 2500 tons, and 47
are 1000 tons or under.
     War-ship dimensions and cost are not to be regulated by arbi
trarily chosen limits. The proper procedure is obviously to decide
what qualities shall be possessed by each type, and to produce ships
possessing those qualities.     No better guide under existing circum
stances, and apart from actual experience in naval warfare, can bo
found than in making provision for meeting the possible attacks of
foreign fleets, and securing superiority in numbers and in fighting
efficiency in each class.    Since British ships are built for operating
on an enemy's coast, it is the practice to give them larger coal sup
plies, more stores, equipment and ammunition.      Hence they are, class
for class, of larger displacement than foreign ships. They are not,
however, of greater cost than foreign ships of less displacement.        A
Royal Sovereign can be produced in a Government dockyard for a net
cost, excluding armament, of about 760,0002.         Tho corresponding
cost for a French, Russian or American battle-ship of the first class
is from 900.000Z. to 1,000,000Z.        Consequently in the matter of
money value risked on each ship we have a distinct advantage, thanks
to our more economical construction.
     Taking armament and stores into account, one of the larger
battle-ships in the Naval Defence fleet represents in round figures a
million sterling when equipped for sea. It is a great responsibility
to command such a costly and complicated fighting machine.          Naval
officers have, however, risen to the occasion, as it is their habit to do.
As regards manageability and manoeuvring power, the big ships have
proved most satisfactory, being as thoroughly under command as
much smaller ships.      It is a very striking thing to see one or two
men steering a ship of 14,000 tons moving at high speed, with the aid
of a steam or hydraulic engine. The huge mass answers every motion
of the helm, and can be made to reverse its course at full speed in 3
to 3J minutes, and in a path whose diameter is about five times the
ship's length.
     A modern fleet requires large expenditure for its construction and
equipment.     The seventy ships of the Naval Defence Programme
will cost about 22? millions, including armaments. Excluding
armaments, ammunition        and reserves, the cost has been about
18 millions, or an average cost per ship of more than a quarter of a
million sterling. This average cost exceeds the cost of the largest
unarmourod screw throo-dockors, carrying 121 guns, which were the
most powerful ships in tho Royal Navy thirty-five years ago.          It is
more than double the cost of the largest sailing three-deckers built
about eighty years ago.       What has been said above furnishes tho

2U                      Mr. William H. White                   [March 9,
explanation of this remarkable increase in outlay on modern ships.
The range of net cost in the dockyard-built ships is from about
780,000Z. for a first class battle-ship down to 50,000Z. for a torpedo
gunboat.
    Allowing for alterations in designs, changes in the rates of wages
to dockyard workmen, and variations in systems of accounts that have
been made since the scheme was first framed, there has been a re
markably close agreement between the original estimate and the
actual outlay. That estimate was 21£ millions, the probable expendi
ture 22f millions, and specific causes of increased cost represent about
one million.     There are few engineering works of great magnitude
where the agreement between estimate and expenditure has been so
close.
    The work of construction has been divided between the Royal
Dockyards and private firms.        Ten millions represent the value of
the contract ships and their armaments ; 12f millions the correspond
ing outlay on and for the Dockyard ships. As a matter of fact, the
real expenditure in the Dockyards has been on labour, representing
about 3f millions.        Materials, machinery, guns, gun-mountings
and other items of equipment have been made outside the Dock
yards.    These figures indicate how large an employment of the
manufacturing and industrial resources of the country has been in
volved in carrying out a programme which adds greatly to our naval
strength.
    It is the more remarkable that the programme should have been
practically carried through as proposed, when it is remembered that
tho five years over which it has extended have been years of unpre
cedented activity in merchant ship construction.        No better proof
could be given of the surpassing resources of this country for ship
building and engineering.      The great requirements in guns and gun-
mountings    have  also  been met   with ease. One incidental result of
the Naval Defence Act which deserves mention is the enlargement of
our resources for the manufacture of ordnance, many eminent firms
having undertaken and satisfactorily executed important contracts,
and the guns having been ready in time for the ships.        A necessary
condition of rapid construction is, of course, thorough prevision and
pre-arrangement in all departments, so that there shall be no hin
drance of work while waiting for portions of armament or equipment.
Rapid construction also means ample financial provision, adjusted to
the greatest rate of progress obtainable.      Unless such provision is
made the work must linger on, and progress will be regulated by the
means available.
    In this brief summary of what is involved in making a modern
fleet, it has been impossible to dwell upon the many difficulties that
have to be met in connection with war-ship designs.        War-ships are
primarily fighting machines.        Fighting efficiency dominates their
designs, and more particularly the arrangements laid down as neces
sary for armaments and protection.         Every cubic foot of internal

1894.]             on the Making of a Modern Fleet.                    215
space has to be appropriated to and fitted for some special purpose.
Accepting these fixed conditions, the endeavour of naval architects is
to fulfil them in ships which shall be strong, stable and sea-worthy,
possessing the speeds and coal-supplies specified for various types.
If complete success is not attained in all cases it should be remem
bered that the problems which have to be solved, are of increasing
difficulty and complexity.    And, on the whole, it may be claimed
that the designers of modern war-ships, with the aid of their col-
laborateurs — marine and mechanical engineers, electricians, artille
rists and metallurgists — have achieved remarkable results. Speeds
have been greatly increased, offensive and defensive powers developed,
and sea-keeping qualities maintained.
     Those who have to design and build war-ships, as well as those
 who have to fight them, may be pardoned if they sometimes wish that
earlier and simpler conditions had continued.     But the progress of
invention and the constant struggle for maritime supremacy demand
continuous effort, in order that Her Majesty's ships shall in no sense
be inferior to those produced in other countries.

                       The Scientific Work     of Tyndall.
It is fitting that the present season should not pass without a refer
ence on these evenings to the work of him whose tragic death a few
months since was felt as a personal grief and loss by every member
                                                            I
of the Royal Institution. With much diffidence have undertaken the
task to-night, wishing that it had fallen to one better qualified by long
and intimate acquaintance to do justice to the theme. For Tyndall
was a personality of exceeding interest. He exercised an often magical
charm upon those with whom he was closely associated, but when his
opposition was aroused he showed himself a keen controversialist.
My subject of to-night is but half the story.
    Even the strictest devotion of the time at my disposal to a survey
of the scientific work of Tyndall will not allow of more than a very
imperfect and fragmentary treatment.                During his thirty years of
labour  within    these  walls  he   ranged   over  a vast field, and accumulated
results   of  a  very  varied   character,    important not only to the culti
vators of    the  physical   sciences,   but  also to the biologist. All that     I
can hope    to  do  is to  bring  back   to  your  recollection   tho moro salient
points  of   his  work,   and  to  illustrate   them  where    possible by experi
ments of his own devising.
    In looking through the catalogue of scientific papers issued by
tho Eoyal Society, one of the first entries under the name of Tyndall
relates to a matter comparatively simple, but still of some interest.
It has been noticed that when a jet of liquid is allowed to play into a
receiving vessel, a good deal of air is sometimes carried down with              it,
while at other times this does not happen. The matter was examined
experimentally by Tyndall, and he found that              it was closely connected
with the peculiar transformation undergone by jet of liquid which
                                                             a
had been previously investigated by Savart.           A      jet asit  issues from
tho nozzlo   is    at first cylindrical, but after   a     time   it becomes what
the physiologists call varicose   ;   it    swells in some places and contracts
in others. This effect becomes more exaggerated as the jut descends,
until the swellings separate into distinct drops, which follow one
another in single file.         Savart showed that under the influence of

1894.]               on the Scientific Work    of Tyndall.                    217
vibration the resolution into drops takes place more rapidly, so that
the place of resolution travels up closer to the nozzle.
    Tyndall's observation was that the carrying down of air required
a jet already resolved into drops when it strikes the liquid.      hope   I
to be able to show you the experiment by projection upon the screen.
At the present moment the jet is striking the water in the tank pre
vious to resolution into drops, and is therefore carrying down no air.
If I operate on the nozzle with a vibrating tuning-fork, the resolution
occurs earlier, and the drops now carry down with them a consider
able quantity of air.
    Among the earlier of Tyndall's papers are some relating to ice, a
 subject which attracted him much, probably from his mountaineering
experiences.                                  I
                 About the time of which am speaking Faraday made
 interesting observations upon a peculiar behaviour of ice, afterwards
called by the name of regelation.         He found that if two pieces of ice
were brought into contact they stuck or froze together. The pressure
required to produce this effect need not be more than exceedingly
small. Tyndall found that if fragments of ice are squeezed they pack
themselves into a continuous mass.           We have here some small ice in
a mould, where it can be subjected to a powerful squeeze.               The ice
under this operation will be regelated, and a mass obtained which
may appear almost transparent, and as if it had never been fractured
at all.   The flow of glaciers has been attributed to this action, the
fractures which the stresses produce being mended again by regela
tion.    I should say, perhaps, that the question of glacier motion
presents difficulties not yet wholly explained.              There can be no
doubt, however, that regelation plays an important part.
     Another question treated by Tyndall is the manner in which ice
first begins to melt under the action of a beam of light passing into it
from an electric lamp.       Ice usually melts by conducted heat, which
reaches first the outside layers.      But if we employ a beam from an
electric lamp, the     heat   will  reach     the ice not only outside but
internally, and the melting         will    begin at certain points in the
interior.    Here we have      a slab    of  ice which we project upon the
screen.    We see that    the   melting begins at certain points, which
develop a crystallised appearance resembling flowers.                 They are
points in the interior of the ice, not upon the surface. Tyndall found
that when the ice gives way at these internal points there is a forma
tion of apparently empty space.           He carefully melted under water
such a piece of ice,   and  found    that   when the cavity was melted out
there was no escape        of  air,  proving that the cavity was really
vacuous.
     Various speculations have been made as to the cause of this
internal melting at definite points, but here again          I  am not sure if
the difficulty has been altogether     removed.       One  point of importance
brought out by Tyndall        relates   to   the  plane  of the flowers.   It is
parallel to the   direction   in  which     the  ice  originally froze, that  is,
l«rallol to the original surface of the water from which was formed.
                                                                 it

      I
      must not dwell further upon isolated questions, however inter
esting ; but will pass on at once to our main subject, which may be
divided into three distinct parts, relating namely to heat, especially
dark radiation, sound, and the behaviour of small particles, such as
compose dust, whether of living or dead matter.
    The earlier publications of Tyndall on the subject of heat are for
                                                     '
the most part embodied in his work entitled            Heat as a Mode of
Motion.' This book has fascinated many readers.                I
                                                               could name
more than one now distinguished physicists who drew their first
scientific nutriment from it.     At the time of its appearance the law
of the equivalence of heat and work was quite recently established by
the labours of Mayer and Joule, and had taken firm hold of the minds
of scientific men ; and a great part of Tyndall's book may be con
sidered to be inspired by and founded upon this first law of thermo
dynamics.     At the time of publication of Joule's labours, however,
there seems to have been a considerable body of hostile opinion,
favourable to the now obsolete notion that heat is a distinct entity
called caloric.   Looking back, it is a little difficult to find out who
were responsible for this reception of the theory of caloric.      Perhaps
it was rather the popular writers of the time than the first scientific
authorities.    A scientific worker, especially if he devotes himself to
original work, has not time to examine for himself all questions,
even those relating to his own department, but must take something
on trust from others whom he regards as authorities.        One might say
that a knowledge of science, like a knowledge of law, consists in knowing
where to look for it. But even this kind of knowledge is not always
easy to obtain.    It is only by experience that one can find out who
are most entitled to confidence.     It is difficult now to understand the
hesitation that was shown in fully accepting the doctrine that heat is
a mode of motion, for all the great authorities, especially in England,
seem to have favoured it.      Not to mention Newton and Cavendish, we
have Rumford making almost conclusive experiments in its support,
Davy accepting   it,  and Young, who was hardly ever wrong, speaking
of the antagonistic theory almost with contempt.         On the Continent
perhaps, and especially among the French school of chemists and
physicists, caloric had more influential support.
     As has been said, great part, though not the whole of Tyndall's
                       a
work was devoted to the new doctrine.              Much relates to other
matters, such as radiant heat. Objection has been taken to this
phrase, not altogether without reason; for              may be said that
when heat
           it
           is     not radiant, and while radiant  it it    not heat.
                                                          is            The
term dark radiation, or dark radiance as Newcombe calls it,          prefer
                                                                    is
able, and was often used by Tyndall.      If   we analyse, as Newton did,
the components of light,     we find that  only certain parts are visible.
The invisible parts produce, however, as great, or greater, effects in
other ways than do the visible parts. The heating effect, for example,
is vastly greater in the invisible region than in the visible.       One of
the experiments that Tyndall devised in order to illustrate this fact      I

 1894.]               on the Scientific Work of Tyndall.                      219
 hope now to repeat.       He found that it was possible by means of a
 solution of iodine in bisulphide of carbon to isolate the invisible rays.
 This solution is opaque to light; even the sun could not be seen
 through it ; but it is very fairly transparent to the invisible ultra-red
 radiation.    By means of a concave reflector       I  concentrate the rays
 from an arc lamp.      In their path is inserted the opaque solution, but
 in the focus of invisible radiation the heat developed is sufficient to
 cause the inflammation of a piece of gun-cotton.
     Tyndall varied this beautiful experiment in many ways. By
raising to incandescence a piece of platinum foil, he illustrated the
 transformation of invisible into visible radiation.
     The most important work, however, that we owe to Tyndall in
connection with heat is the investigation of the absorption by gaseous
 bodies of invisible radiation.      Melloni had examined the behaviour
of solid and liquid bodies, but not of gaseous.         He found that trans
 parent bodies like glass might be very opaque to invisible radiation.
 Thus, as we all know, a glass screen will keep off the heat of a fire,
while if we wish to protect ourselves from the sun, the glass screen
 would be useless.      On the other hand rock salt freely transmitted
invisible radiation.     But nothing had been done on the subject of
 gaseous absorption, when Tyndall attacked this very difficult problem.
 Some of his results are shown in the accompanying table.                    The
absorption of the ordinary non-condensable, or rather, not easily
condensable gases — for we must not talk of non-condensable gases
now, least of all in this place — the absorption of these gases is very
small ; but when we pass to the more compound gases, such as nitrio
oxide, we find the absorption much greater — and in the case of
olefiant gas we see that the absorbing power is as much as 6000
times that of the ordinary gases.

     There is  one substance as to which there has been a great         diversity
of opinion —aqueous vapour.           Tyndall found that aqueous vapour
exercises a strong power of absorption — strong relatively to that of the
air in which it is contained. This is of course a question of great
importance, especially in relation to meteorology.          Tyndall's conclu
sions were vehemently contested by many of the authorities of the time,
among whom was Magnus, the celebrated physicist of Berlin.                  With
a view to this lecture    I  have gone somewhat carefully into this ques
tion, and   I have been greatly impressed by the care and skill showed
by Tyndall, even in his earlier experiments upon this subject.                He
                                                                     Q 2

220                             Lord Rayleigh                  [March  16,
was at once sanguine and sceptical — 1» combination necessary for
success in any branch of science. The experimentalist who is not
sceptical will be led away on a false tack and accept conclusions
which he would find it necessary to reject were he to pursue the
matter further ; if not sanguine, he will be discouraged altogether by
the difficulties encountered in his earlier efforts, and so arrive at no
conclusion at all. One criticism, however, may be made.       Tyndall did
not at first describe with sufficient detail the method and the precau
tions which he used.      There was a want of that precise information
necessary    to allow another to follow in his steps.   Perhaps this may
have been due to his literary instinct, which made him averse from
overloading his pages with technical experimental details.
     The controversy above referred to     I  think we may now consider
to be closed. Nobody now doubts the absorbing power of aqueous
vapour.     Indeed the question seems to have entered upon a new
                                                      ' Annalen,' Paschen
phase ; for in a recent number of Wiedemann's
investigates the precise position in the spectrum of the rays which are
absorbed by aqueous vapour.
     I  cannot attempt to show you here any of the early experiments
on the absorption of vapours.           But some years later Tyndall
contrived an experiment, which will allow of reproduction.           It is
founded on some observations of Graham Bell, who discovered that
various bodies became sonorous when exposed to intermittent radia
tion.
     The radiation is supplied from incandescent lime, and is focussed
by a concave reflector.     In the path of the rays is a revolving wheel
provided with projecting teeth. When a tooth intervenes, the radia
tion is stopped ; but in the interval between the teeth the radiation
passes through, and falls upon any object held at the focus.          The
object in this case is a small glass bulb containing a few drops of
ether, and communicating with the ear by a rubber tube. Under the
operation of the intermittent radiation the ether vapour expands and
contracts ; in other words a vibration is established, and a sound is
heard by the observer. But if the vapour were absolutely diather-
manous, no sound would be heard.
     I  have repeated the experiment of Tyndall which allowed him to
distinguish between the behaviour of ordinary air and dry air.         If,
dispensing with ether, we fill the bulb with air in the ordinary moist
state, a sound is heard with perfect distinctness, but if we drop in
a little sulphuric acid, so as to dry the air, the sound disappears.
     According to the law of exchanges, absorption is connected with
radiation ; so that while hydrogen or oxygen do not radiate, from
ammonia we might expect to get considerable radiation.             In the
following experiment     I aim at showing that the radiation of hot coal
 gas exceeds the radiation of equally hot air.
     The face of the thermopile, protected by screens from the ball
 itself, is exposed to the radiation from the heated air which rises
 from a hot copper ball. The effect is manifested by the light reflected

1894.]             on the Scientific   Work   of Tyndatt.               221
from a galvanometer mirror.    When we replace the air by a stream
of coal gas, the galvanometer indicates an augmentation of heat, so
that we have before us a demonstration that coal gas when heated
does radiate more than equally hot air, from which we conclude
that it would exercise more absorption than air.
   I   come now to the second division of my subject, that relating to
Sound. Tyndall, as you know, wrote a book on Sound, founded on
lectures delivered in this place. Many interesting and original dis
coveries are there embodied.         One that     Ihave been especially
interested in myself, is on the subject of sensitive flames.    Professor
Leconte in America made the first observations at an amateur con
cert, but it was Tyndall who introduced the remarkable high-pressure
flame now before you. It issues from a pin-hole burner, and the
sensitiveness is entirely a question of the pressure at which the gas
is supplied.     Tyndall describes the phenomenon by saying that the
flame under the influence of a high pressure is like something on the
edge of a precipice.     If    left alone, it will maintain itself ; but
under the slightest touch it will be pushed over.       The gas at high
pressure will, if undisturbed, burn steadily and erect, but if a hiss is
made in its neighbourhood it becomes at once unsteady, and ducks
down.     A very high sound is necessary. Even a whistle, as you see,
does not act.       Smooth pure sounds are practically without effect
unless of very high pitch.
    I  will illustrate the importance of the flame as a means of investi
gation by an experiment in the diffraction of sound.        Ihave here a
source of sound, but of pitch so high as to be inaudible.      The waves
impinge perpendicularly upon a circular disc of plate glass.       Behind
the disc there is a sound shadow, and you might expect that the
shadow would be most complete at the centre.          But this is not so.
When the burner occupies this position the flame flares ; but when by
a slight motion of the disc the position of the flame is made eccentric,
the existence of the shadow is manifested by the recovery of the
flame. At the centre the intensity of sound is the same as if no
obstacle were interposed.
    The optical analogue of the above experiment was made at the
suggestion of Poisson, who had deduced the result theoretically, but
considered it so unlikely that he regarded it as an objection to the
undulatory theory of light. Now,       I  need hardly say, it is regarded
as a beautiful confirmation.
    It is of importance to prove that the flame is not of the essence of
the matter, that there is no need to have a flame, or to ignite it at the
burner.    Thus, it is quite possible to have a jet of gas so arranged
that ignition does not occur until the jet has lost its sensitiveness.
The sensitive part is that quite close to the nozzle, and the flame is
only an indicator.     But it is not necessary to have any kind of flame
at all. Tyndall made observations on smoke-jets, showing that a jet
of air can be made sensitive to sound. The difficulty is to see   it, and

                               Lord Rayleigh                    [March 16,
to operate successfully upon it ; because, as Tyndall soon found, a
smoke-jet is much more difficult to deal with than flames, and is sen
sitive to much graver sounds.       I doubt whether   I am wise in trying
to exhibit smoke-jets to an audience, but      I  have a special means of
projection by which      I ought at least to succeed in making them
visible. It consists in a device by which the main part of the light
from the lamp is stopped at the image of the arc, so jthat the only
light which can reach the screen is light which by diffusion has been
diverted out of its course.     Thus we shall get an exhibition of a jet
of smoke upon the screen, showing bright on a dark ground.            The
jet issues near the mouth of a resonator of pitch 256. When un
disturbed it pursues a straight course, and remains cylindrical.
 But if a fork of suitable pitch be sounded in the neighbourhood, the
jet spreads out into a sort of fan, or even bifurcates, as you see
upon the screen. The real motion of the jet cannot of course be
ascertained by mere inspection.         It consists in a continuously in
creasing sinuosity, leading after a while to complete disruption.       If
 two forks slightly out of unison are sounded together, the jet
 expands and re-collects itself, synchronously with the audible beats.
 I   should say that my jet is a very coarse imitation of Tyndall's.
                    I
 The nozzle that am using is much too large. With a proper nozzle,
 and in a perfectly undisturbed atmosphere — undisturbed not only
 by sounds, but free from all draughts — the sensitiveness is wonderful.
 The slightest noise is seen to act instantly and to bring the jet down
 to a fraction of its former height.
       Another important part of Tyndall's work on Sound was carried
 out as adviser of the Trinity House.         When in thick weather the
 ordinary lights fail, an attempt is made to replace them with sound
 signals.    These are found to vary much in their action, sometimes
 being heard to a very great distance, and at other times failing to
 make themselves audible even at a moderate distance.        Two explana
  tions have been suggested, depending upon acoustic refraction and
  acoustic reflection.
       Under the influence of variations of temperature refraction occurs
  in the atmosphere. For example, sound travels more quickly in
  warm than in cold air.    If, as often happens, it is colder above, the
  upper part of the sound wave tends to lag behind, and the wave is
  liable to be tilted upwards and so to be carried over the head of the
  would-be observer on the surface of the ground.         This explanation
  of acoustic refraction by variation of temperature was given by
   Prof. Osborne Reynolds.      As Sir G. Stokes showed, refraction is also
   caused by wind.     The difference between refraction by wind and by
   temperature variations is that in one case everything turns upon the
   direction in which the sound is going, while in the second case this
   consideration is immaterial.      The sound is heard by an observer
   down wind, and not so well by an observer up wind.         The explana
   tion by refraction of the frequent failure of sound signals was that
   adopted by Prof. Henry in America, a distinguished         worker upon

1894.]               on the Scientific Work   of Tyndall.                 223
this subject.    Tyndall's investigations,      however, led him to favour
another explanation.        His view  was  that  sound was actually reflected
by atmospheric irregularities.         He   observed,   what appears to be
amply sufficient    to  establish   his case,  that  prolonged signals from
fog sirens give   rise   to  echoes  audible  after  the signal has stopped.
This echo was heard from the air over the sea, and lasted in many
cases a long time, up to 15 seconds.        There seems here no alternative
but to suppose that reflection must have occurred internally in the
atmosphere.     In some cases the explanation of the occasional
diminished penetration of sound seems to be rather by refraction,
and in others by reflection.
     Tyndall proved that a single layer of hot air is sufficient to cause
reflection, and   I  propose to repeat his experiment.        The source of
sound, a toy reed, is placed at one end of one metallic tube, and a
sensitive flame at one end of a second.           The opposite ends of these
tubes are placed near each other, but in a position which does not
permit the sound waves issuing from the one to enter the other
directly. Accordingly the flame shows no response. If, however, a
pane of glass be held suitably, the waves are reflected back and the
flame is excited.      Tyndall's experiment consists in the demonstra
tion that a flat gas flame is competent to act the part of a reflector.
When     I  hold the gas flame in the proper position, the percipient
flame flares ; when the flat flame is removed or held at an unsuit
able angle, there is almost complete recovery.
     It is true that in the atmosphere no such violent transitions of
density can occur as are met with in a flame ; but, on the other hand,
the interruptions may be very numerous, as is indeed rendered
probable by the phenomena of stellar scintillation.
     The third portion of my subject must be treated very briefly.
The guiding idea of much of Tyndall's work on atmospheric particles
was the application of an intense illumination to render them evident.
Fine particles of mastic, precipitated on admixture of varnish with a
large quantity of water, had already been examined by Briicke. Che
mically precipitated sulphur is convenient, and allows the influence
of size to be watched as the particles grow. But the most interesting
observations of Tyndall relate to precipitates in gases caused by the
chemical action of the light itself.      This may be illustrated by causing
the concentrated rays of the electric lamp to pass through a flask
containing vapour of peroxide of chlorine. Within a few seconds
dense clouds are produced.
     When the particles are very small in comparison with the wave
length, the laws governing the dispersion of the light are simple.
Tyndall pursued the investigation to the case where the particles have
grown beyond the limit above indicated, and found that the polarisa
tion of the dispersed light was effected in a peculiar and interesting
manner.
     Atmospheric dust, especially in London, is largely organic. If,

224        Lord Bayleigh  on the Scientific Work   of Tyndall.   [March 16,
following Tyndall,     we hold a spirit lamp under the track of the light
from the electric lamp, the dark spaces, resulting from the combus
tion of the dust, have all the appearance of smoke.
     In confined and undisturbed spaces the dust settles out.        I have
here a large flask which has been closed for some days.         If I hold it
to the lamp, the track of the light, plainly visible before entering
and after leaving the flask, is there interrupted.         This, it will be
evident, is a matter of considerable importance in connection with
 organic germs.
      The question of the spontaneous generation of life occupied
Tyndall for several years. He brought to bear upon it untiring
perseverance and refined experimental skill, and his results are those
now generally accepted.       Guarding himself from too absolute state
ments as to other times and other conditions, he concluded that under
 the circumstances of our experiments life is always founded upon
 life. The putrefaction of vegetable and animal infusions, even when
 initially sterilised, is to be attributed to the intrusion of organic
 germs from the atmosphere.
      The universal presence of such germs is often regarded as a
 hypothesis difficult of acceptance.      It may be illustrated by an ex
 periment from the inorganic world.          I have here, and can project
 upon the screen, glass pots, each containing a shallow layer of a
 supersaturated solution of sulphate of soda.           Protected by glass
 covers, they have stood without crystallising for forty-eight hours.
 But if    I remove the cover, a few seconds or minutes will see the
 crystallisation commence. It has begun, and long needles are in
 vading the field of view. Here it must be understood that, with a
 few exceptions, the crystalline germ required to start the action must
 be of the same nature as the dissolved salt ; and the conclusion is
 that small crystals of sulphate of soda are universally present in the
 atmosphere.
      I  have now completed my task.         With more or less success     I
 have   laid before you the  substance  of some  of Tyndall's contributions
 to knowledge.      What   I  could not   hope  to  recall was the brilliant
 and often poetic exposition by which his vivid imagination illumined
 the dry facts of science.      Some reminiscence of this may still be
 recovered by the reader of his treatises and memoirs; but much
 survives only as an influence exerted upon the minds of his contem
 poraries, and manifested in subsequent advances due to his inspiration.

                WEEKLY EVENING MEETING,
                        Friday, April   6, 1894.
 Sir Riohard Weester, G.C.M.Q. M.P. Q.C. LL.D. Vice-President,

                 The Destructive Effects   of Projectiles.
The   effects of small projectiles when driven at high velocity through
the tissues of the brain have always excited the deepest interest, for
very obvious reasons.
    This interest must always be two-sided, namely : '(1) Physical ;
(2) Pathological; and it is upon these two points of view that             I
propose to speak to you this evening.
    Conceive a cylindrical bullet with a conical head flying through
the air some ten or fifteen times faster than an express train.
    We have now to study what it is doing in its aerial flight, and
what will happen when that terminates by the projectile striking both
hard and soft substances.
    This embodies matter for the purely physical side of the work.
    But imagine, further, that the hard and soft substances just
mentioned are the skull and brain respectively, what will happen
then ?
    This is the pathological part of the question, and it is one of the
greatest moment ; for whereas it is true that a few persons do survive
being shot in the head, the large majority die ; and it is my object to
show you how a combination of physical and pathological experiments
has revealed the reason why the majority do die, and revealed              it,
fortunately, so distinctly as to suggest means for warding off the fatal
result.
    1. Physical Considerations. —First take the case of bullet flying
                                                             a
through the atmosphere. Here in this extremely beautiful photograph,
kindly lent me by Professor Boys, you observe that the bullet drives
before    it
           awave of compressed air.     Now this compressed air-wave       is
what  is popularly called the wind of the shot, and to       used to be
                                                             it
ascribed by military surgeons  a    certain proportion of deaths.   The
origin of this theory is  difficult to discover, as the only case  I am
aware of in which the post-mortem examination did not reveal
haemorrhage, fracture, &c., indicating that the shot had actually
struck the body (though without injuring the highly elastic skin),         is
the instance given by the great Russian military surgeon, Pirogoff, in

 1894.]             on Destructive Effects of Projectiles.              229
 bis interesting surgical experiences of the Crimean war.         Even this
 instance finds a priori a more reasonable explanation in syncope, and we
shall see directly that the wind of the shot not only cannot under any
circumstances kill a man, but also that its energy is far too slight
for it to have any destructive effect whatever. It is rather curious to
find that but few attempts have been made directly to estimate the
wind of the shot, and those by Pelikan and others are only for large
shot and by too coarse methods to be applicable in the case of a bullet,
as the following experiment shows.
     An extremely light vane of paper carrying a delicate mirror is
suspended to a cocoon fibre, and carefully protected from currents of
air in the room. A very gentle puff causes the vane to fly out most
vigorously, yet we shall find that the 380 bullet moving 1000 feet
                                            •
a second may pass within 8 inches of it without causing the least
deviation of a ray of light reflected from the mirror. It is only when
the bullet passes within an inch or two of the edge of the vane that
there is some slight rotation.     The • 303 magazine service rifle, with
a velocity of twice that of the larger bullet, produces little more than
the same result.      It is therefore obvious in this case that the far
higher velocity is more than compensated for by the lesser sectional
area of the projectile displacing the air.         Although there was no
proof of much displacement of the air, it was pretty generally held
that when the bullet entered any substance the compressed air driven
before it exercised an explosive effect.      This opinion was more par
ticularly supported by the Belgian physicist Melsens, who actually
described it by the term " projectile air." The matter was taken up
from the point of view of pure physics, and Magnus demonstrated that
if a body like a bullet entered water, e.g. in falling the funnel which the
displaced water makes in the axis of the body as soon as that is fully
immersed, entangles air, and that it is this air which is carried by
the body into the fluid, rather than that any air is forced in in front
of the bullet. In answer to Magnus, Laroque invented the following
ingenious experiment.       He allowed a long body, incapable of wholly
sinking, to drop into the water, and then found that there was air
driven in in front of it ; while, by the nature of the experiment, he
had, of course, excluded the possibility of any air following the base
of the projectile.     I have repeated all these experiments (employing
in Laroque's a slender rod of wood) and found that while his conten
tion that air is driven in front of the bullet is completely substantiated,
yet Magnus' observation is so far correct that air is also drawn in
after it, the fact being that the two conditions are not opposed but
simultaneous.     Magnus' view was further supported by the adverse
criticism of the theory of projectile air of the celebrated French
artillerist Morin, which criticism amounted to this, that when a
projectile was directed against a solid body it must necessarily follow
that so elastic a substance as air should be completely reflected from
the surface.    I  should like to draw your attention to this word solid,
because   I believe that in that we find the key to the difficulty, and

230                      Professor  Victor Horsley              [April  6,
the apparent paradoxes presented to us are to be explained by the
fact that the results are wholly dependent upon the simple question
of the relative viscosities of the substances entered. To solve this
I  employed the same falling bodies, and examined their entanglement
of air in water and glycerine respectively, and found that whereas, in
the case of water, Laroque's non-floating rod drove air in front of it
as well as probably at the side, yet when the same rod was caused to
fall into glycerine of high concentration there was no air in front, but
air-bubbles could be seen clinging to the sides of the rod.      Further,
in glycerine the entanglement of air in the funnel formed by the base
of the bullet, as described by Magnus, was very striking.               It
appeared to me that whatever air was driven in front of it was wholly
reflected by the sufficiently viscous fluid, and hence it must be,
a fortiori, still more completely reflected from the surfaces of hard
and soft solids like the skull and brain respectively.
     To sum up, the so-called projectile air can have no real bursting
effect, since, as I have demonstrated, in the first place it exerts very
feeble pressure, as tested on a delicate vane, and in the second place
it is certainly easily reflected from surfaces of but moderate density.
     The Influence of Rotation produced by Rifling. — It is commonly
thought that the spin of the bullet communicated to it by the rifling
of the barrel, and which is very great, causes a considerable amount
of the disturbance created in the interior of moist substances, which
is usually spoken of as the bursting or explosive effect.         Kocher
thought that this would not be appreciable, and that the rotatory
movement would only cause the displaced particles to take a course
tangential to the surface of the bullet rather than perpendicular.
 Although the smooth surface of the bullet of course adds force to the
idea that its rotation is not very effective, it is obviously a matter of
both interest and importance that the matter should be more closely
studied.    Colonel Henrad made plaster casts of the tracks of shots,
and obtained distinct spiral markings indicative of the rotation in
question.    Acting on this suggestion, it was easy to institute a series
of experiments of the following kind. Pure modelling clay of firm
consistence (for the influence of the water present vide infra) was
rendered homogeneous by kneading, shaped into square blocks of
varying length, and supported in a hard flat surface or in a box, the
ends being open. The cavity made by the bullet in entering and
traversing the mass was then filled with liquid plaster-of-paris,     and
a cast obtained.     Examples of such casts are before you, and they
 completely display the rotation in question.
     The first point which has to be borne in mind is the relation of
the rotation to the projection or forward movement of the bullet.      In
passing through a body of little resistance like the air, it is clear
that for every given unit of distance travelled, the displacement
evoked by the rotation must be something very small, because although
the bullet turns one and a half times in traversing the barrel, that
is nearly a yard in length, consequently, so far as the rotation is
                                          -\

1894.]             on Destructive Effects     of Projectiles.               231
concerned, that for a unit, say one inch, of the flight of the bullet would
be extremely small, namely about one-twentieth of the circumference
of the bullet, which roughly speaking, would bo (for the * 880 bullet)
about one-twentieth of an inch, the insignificance of which is obvious.
The matter, however, assumes a somewhat different aspect when a
bullet is engaged in a solid substance through which it is forcing its
way with rapidly diminishing velocity.             In such a case, where the
projection journey    of  the  projectile    is  quickly coming to an end, it
becomes of special importance        to see  what  is becoming of the factor of
rotation.    The  plaster  casts   obtained    in the  manner indicated show
clearly enough    the  interesting    fact  that  the  rotation persists to the
end, when the bullet has simply taken its course through the atmo
sphere and then entered the soft clay.            Further, the casts also show
what is a necessary deduction from our earlier considerations on this
matter, namely, that as the rotation is preserved till the end of the
trajectory, the twist is proportionately more pronounced as the forward
movement is lost.
     It is for our present purpose important to see whether the rotation
is well marked when the projectile is completely deformed. To
examine this point a new series of experiments was undertaken, in
which the bullet was first caused to penetrate a flat bono boforo
entering the clay. It is very clear that the rotation is still present.
In discussing this question      I  have left unnoticed the fact that owing
 to the resistance of a body like clay, the cohesiveness of which of
necessity varies slightly from point to point, there will be a great
 tendency for the bullet to change its direction, more especially as the
 base is heavier than the apex, and to this change of direction must be
attributed in part the change of surface simulating the rotation effects
due to the rifling.    The two conditions, however, can be distinguished
 readily on careful examination.
     So far as destructive effects in the brain are concerned, it is
 therefore clear that relatively little is to be ascribed to rotation.
    Projection   Destructive Effects. — The destruction         by the bullet
 moving forward through a solid body is the most important matter
 for us to consider. There are two sets of factors determining the
 degree of destruction in any given substance.
      1. Factors due to the bullet.
      2. Factors due to the physical constitution of the solid.
      1. Factors due to the bullet.      So far as tho projectilo isconcorncd,
 the chief considerations are (a) its momentum ; (6) its sectional area ;
 (c) its becoming heated.

 stood the greater the velocity the greater the damage for tho samo
 weight of shot, still, in connection with tho small-boro servico riflos
 of the present day, some seem to think that the small bullet, by virtue
 of its travelling at a great pace, would piereo tho tissues without
 causing much general damage.            The fallacy involved in this belief
 we shall see directly ; but a single glance at tho casts arranged in

232                      Professor  Victor Horsley               [April   6,
order of tho velocities of the bullets, shows immediately the unreality
of the notion. In every case the particles of the substance are hurried
forward (particularly evident in the casts before mentioned) in front
of the bullet, and thus by increasing the size of the moving mass such
particles practically constitute a larger projectile.   Much destruction
is due to this, as Delorme has more particularly demonstrated in the
well-known case of firing a bullet into a book, wherein one may see
the laceration of the pages successively increased, although the
momentum of the bullet is steadily diminishing, and in proportion to
the increasing laceration so discs of increasing diameter are found in
the cavity, having been cut from the preceding pages.       The hurrying
forward of the particles is very beautifully shown by Professor Boys
in his photographs of the debris of glass plates after a bullet has
passed through them.      In one case a large fragment of glass is shown
to be moving parallel to the bullet, i.e. with the same velocity.     This
question of accessory damage is of much importance to the patho
logical problem how much damage is effected in the brain.           I have
found discs of bone forced through the brain, such discs (as will
appear directly) being larger than the projectile itself.            Small
fragments are also hurried forward with the same velocity as the
bullet, as these casts show, the plaster method thus confirming
Professor Boys' photographic record.
                         —
     (b) Sectional Area. From what has just been said, it is plain that
the crushing effect of the bullet will be greatly increased if its
diameter is enlarged ; and it is understood that this was the reason
why the Duke of Wellington opposed the introduction of the smaller
bore weapon for the old musket called " Brown Bess."             But few
words, therefore, are requisite in dealing with this point.       I   wish,
however, to draw attention to an extremely common result of the
employment of leaden bullets, and a result which is wholly dependent
on the principle just enunciated.     In the photograph of the penetra
tion of an iron plate by the magazine rifle bullet, it will be noticed
that the diameter of the holes is almost twice that of the bullet as it
leaves the muzzle of the rifle.    When the bullet is picked up, how
ever, after it has passed through the plate, the reason of this seeming
absurdity is at once recognised, for the bullet is compressed into a
hard mass of lead and nickel by its first impact on the front of the
plate, of the size of the hole shown.      It is important, therefore, for
the military surgeon to consider what proportion of the damage is due
to deformation of the projectile on its striking the body, but the
sectional area demands very little attention when compared to the
velocity as a source of destruction.
     (c) Heating.
                  — The notion that a bullet produced some of its
destructive effects in consequence of its being raised in temperature,
as a natural result of some of its momentum being converted into
heat, has always been before scientists ever since the invention of
firearms, and endless have been the suggestions put forward to
support this idea.    I am not going to waste your time on the matter,

  1894.]-            on Destructive Effects of Projectiles.            233
  because, in spite of the plausible papers of Hagenbach and Socin,
  there are certain facts plain and simple enough which, to my mind,
  completely dispose of the notion put forward by those authors,
  namely, that the bullet undergoing deformation on striking a hard
  substance like bone becomes heated so intensely that it partly fuses.
  The simplest observation of all is that,     I think, made by Yon Beck,
 and which     I have often confirmed, namely that a bullet, though com
  pletely deformed by impact, may enclose a hair or piece of wood
 without these being in the least degree altered by heat ; while as for
 its being heated in the barrel, &c., that cannot amount to 40 C, for
 Messncr haB shown that a bullet traversing dirty clothing carries
 with it living microbes, and deposits them in the object it strikes,
 still in a living state, so that they grow therein if the soil is a suit
 able one ; and these observations have been fully confirmed by
 Delorme and Laveran.        It is to bo hoped that we have heard the last
 of this unquestionably exaggerated idea of the heating of a bullet.
      2. Factors due to the physical constitution of the solid.
      We now enter upon the discussion of the most interesting of all
 the physical considerations determining the well-known bursting
 effect which a bullet produces on certain substances, e.g. clay, brain,
 &c, whilo simply perforating others, e.g. wood, iron, &c. The reason
 why a bullet behaves apparently quite differently when it is forcing
 its way through solids of different kinds, has been, as a matter of fact,
 answered ever since 1848, when Huguier made some remarkable, but
 little known, researches on the effects of bullets on soft tissues, after
 he had observed the results of the wounds inflicted in the fighting in
 Paris in 1848. It will be remembered that in that struggle, as in
others, the appearance of bursting within the tissues was very note
worthy, and gave rise to the notion of explosive bullets having been
employed by the combatants contrary to the received opinions of
international comity. The whole question is a perfectly simple
matter, and resolves itself merely into the proposition that destructive
effects vary in direct proportion to the cohesiveness, i.e. the fluidity
of the particles composing the body. Ever since the observations of
Tresca, Boborts-Austen and others, we have been made familiar with
the phenomenon of the flow of metals when these are subjected to
powerful pressure, and the mode of the displacement of the particles
has always been compared to the displacement observed in viscous
fluids.   The extreme case in which fluidity is least present is that of
the substances which we term brittle.        In these, while much pulveri
sation occurs, the displacement of particles laterally is very slightly
marked.      Contrast the penetration of an example of this class, namely
a flat, thin bone, with the effect produced on a more or less plastic
solid like brain, and a striking difference presents itself, for whereas
the bone is simply penetrated in the long axis of the bullet, the brain
is thrown aside in every direction.        Huguier made observations on
certain dead organs, e.g. lung, liver, &c, and suggested that the reason
why there was so much lateral disturbance was that the tissues oon-

234                      Professor    Victor Horsley                     [April 6
taincd water in large quantity and that the energy of the moving
projectile being imparted to the particles of water, caused the disper
sion of these in a hydrodynamic fashion.                Kocher, in 1874 to 1876,
was the first who thoroughly dealt with this question in the manner
shadowed forth by Huguier, and he proved, in a series of interesting
experiments, which Dr. Kramer and myself have fully confirmed, that
the effect is really a hydrodynamic one.            One of the simplest of his
observations you see before yon, and is made as follows : — Two tin
canisters are taken of precisely the same size and strength, and are
filled with equal quantities of lint ; but in the one case the lint is
dry, in the other saturated with water. When a bullet of moderate
velocity is fired through these canisters, it simply perforates the dry
one, but causes the wet one to burst explosively.              It is, however, not
a simple question in dealing with these artificial schemata merely to
provide a porous substance the cavities of which are filled with water,
for  I  have found that if the intervening              septa are strong, as, for
instance, in the case of sponge, that the bursting effect is not so great.
In fact, the water must be thoroughly incorporated with the substance,
or, to speak more correctly, the substance must be more perfectly fluid.
This can be easily demonstrated by taking dough containing different
percentages of water, and since dough is a substance in which the in
corporation of the water is very complete, it affords a particularly
good example to employ.         By firing bullets of precisely the same
velocity through these samples, you see that the destruction is effected
strictly proportionally to the fluidity of each specimen. This is the
reason why it is really of no absolute value to make experiments on
dead tissues, for the brain in a state of rigor mortis is practically a
solid, since both its living protoplasm and blood in the blood-vessels
have coagulated, whereas in the living condition the fiiv-t is semi-fluid
and the second quite fluid.      It was to investigate this point, as well
as the previous questions, that     I  have paid more especial attention to
the proportionate     relation existing between the velocity and the
explosive effect.    The results are very obvious in the casts before
you.    This work has been immensely facilitated by the kindness of
Sir Andrew Noble. who caused to be constructed at my request a
modification of a 22-calibre rifle, whereby           I can fire a 40-grain bullet
with any velocity   I  wish from a few hundred feet per second to over
8500 feet per second.
     The casts show that the effect in the clay is proportional to (1)
the velocity of the bullet, (2) the wetness of the clay.
     The method of proof is so convincing          I  need not detain you further
in this discussion.
     Since the question is, we now see, all-important, it becomes a
matter of no small moment to study the effect exerted by bullets
entering fluid (for example, water).            In the first place, as may be
seen by these experiments,       the   effect   of   the perforation of a skull,
filled with  water, by  a bullet,  as  was   first  done   by Kocher, is to cause
 the bursting of the sutures.      I  would draw your attention to the fact

1894.]              on Destructive Effects of Projectiles.              235
that the separation of the bones is most marked on the side of the
entry of the bullet.     It was the observation of this latter point which
led me to think that it might be possible to automatically record
the disturbance of the fluid, and this was effected in the following
way.
     A long trough having been prepared, with one end closed with
rubber one-eighth of an inch thick, and a tall, white, flat surface
lowered vertically into the trough, the latter is filled with a solution
of methylene blue.        A small bullet of low velocity (600 feet per
second)   is fired in the  long axis of the trough, 1 cm. below the surface
of the water. As a result, a wave is thrown up against the white
screen, which is consequently marked with a blue splash, the same
describing a curve indicating, firstly, that the disturbance is greatest
where the velocity and resistance, increased by compression, are both
at their highest, i.e. soon after the bullet enters the fluid ; and
secondly, that the displacement diminishes gradually as the momentum
lessens.
     Complete confirmation of the parallelism between soft solids and
fluids in their behaviour to the rapidly-moving bullet, is seen in
comparing the cast of the track made by a bullet moving through
clay with the curves obtained by the water record.
     In both the maximal displacement occurs shortly after the bullet
has entered the substance, and in both the diminution of disturbance
is much more gradual than its development, and is evidently propor
 tional in the main to the loss of momentum. A final proof is afforded
by suspending columns of methylene blue in clear water or salt
solution, and then firing through the whole.           With the ¦380 bullet
and three grains of smokeless powder the last column in the 4-foot
trough was not disturbed.
     This, doubtless, is a result which would be generally foreseen, but
it was worth while to test it experimentally, and it certainly very
strikingly demonstrates how localised the bursting disturbance is,
which completely explains the limitation of the explosive effect on
 the skull on the side of entry.     Sundry interesting subordinate points
 arose in the course of these experiments, and have served to afford
 the necessary control of the method, e.g. the peculiar splash of the
 bullet striking the rubber end of the trough alone, i.e. not pene
trating ; and, again, the tracing made by a bullet which, being fired
a little too superficially, records the elevation of successive waves as
 it ricochets along the surface ; and, finally, the record of a bullet
 deflected by the resistance of the water (as well as by want of
 horizon tality, showing a long, oblique splash where it has carried up
 the fluid into the air.
     From all these experiments on the pure physics of this subject we
 are justified in believing that when a bullet is fired against the head
 (whether that of a man or any other warm-blooded animal), so as to
 penetrate the cerebral hemispheres in a transverse direction, the
 following series of phenomena occurs. The impact of the bullet on
                                                                 R 2

the bone causes depression of that bone over an area larger than the
diameter of the uninjured bullet, this causing a slight rise of tension
in the skull, since that cavity is completely filled with fluid, eg. the
cerebro-spinal fluid and blood in the blood-vessels, together with the
living brain, which, as has already been stated, is a semi- viscous
substance     Iu the next instant the bullet enters the cavity, and the
slight rise of tension is instantly converted by the universal displace
ment (explosive effect) of the contents, into a very severe rise of
pressure, most marked on the side of entry.        The lines of force which
this pressure takes are shown in this diagram, and it will be obvious
to you that these forces will, on meeting the rigid skull, tend, as                  I
have already shown, to burst            it,

presently see, of special puthological significance.        As you see from
the diagram, the brain substance must be driven against the internal
surface of the globular cranium.        This driving of the brain against
the hard bone        exemplified in every post-mortem examination.          A
good instance   is is seen in the accompanying        specimen, in which,
although the bullet traversed the extreme tips of the frontal lobe and
the olfactory bulbs, numerous bruises are seen on the hinder
portions, where they have been crushed against the bone. Similarly
evidences of the direct transmission of the pressures are to be found
at the base of the brain in the longitudinal fissure, &c., wherever, in
short, the brain can be pressed against an unyielding substance. The
final proof of the correctness of this interpretation          to be referred
                                                                   is

portions of the brain into the air, and not so much on the basal
regions as just described.     So, too, the energy of the bullet is com
municated in the same way to the fluid in the ventricular cavities

(Duret's choc cephalo-rachidien "), which tunnel the brain down to
the medulla oblongata.       The medulla oblongata         thus subjected to

pressure from two sources: (1) the hydrodynamic displacement of
the brain en masse      ;  (2) the direct crushing effect due to the
movement of    the  cerebro-spinal fluid in the ventricles.

considerations, namely, the reason why these disturbances within the
skull cause death, and how the fatal issue           is

   2    Pathological Considerations. — The experiments, the results of
which I   now wish to lay before you, constitute          long series which
                                                              a
was carried out last year by Dr. Kramer and myself.             We arranged
the experiments as follows A dog was placed under ether, and one

femoral artery connected with       a mercurial manometer to give record
of the  heart beats  and  pressure  of  the blood in the trunk arteries of
the circulatory system.      Another    similar manometer was connected
with the peripheral    end  of  an artery  so as to record the changes of

  1894.]              on Destructive Effects     of Projectiles.                237
 pressure in the small capillary vessels, changes which I may remark
 incidentally are usually due to those disturbances in the central
 nervous system which we call vaso-motor.                Thirdly, the movements
 of respiration are traced on the recording surface by means of rubber
 tambours, known as Bert's and Marey's respectively.                If the pressure
 within the skull was also to be recorded, then a steel tube filled with
 the salt solution was fixed into a trephine opening, and connected by
 a rubber air-tube also with a Marey's tambour.               Occasionally we put
 on the same paper a record of the contraction of the rectus femoris
 muscle, this latter being directly connected with a Fick's spring
 myograph.       At the bottom of the tracing is given, firstly, the
 record of the movements of an electro-magnet signal (Smith's)
 interrupted by a metronome beating seconds.                 The last line traced
 is that from a Smith's signal in the circuit of a single cell, and
 one of the wires from which is made of very slender brass and
 fixed across the muzzle of the pistol or rifle, so that when the
 shot leaves the muzzle it cuts it and breaks the contact (Woolwich
 method).
      When a bullet of low velocity (600 f.p.s.) strikes the skull in a
 glancing fashion, there is only a trifling disturbance of respiration,
 but when the bullet enters the cranial cavity and sets up the powerful
 hydrodynamic       pressure before referred to, a very severe effect is
 produced, namely complete arrest of the respiration and a slight fall
 of the central blood pressure, this causing a similar feeble fall in the
 peripheral blood pressure.        A little later (5-10 sees.) than the arrest
 of respiration a remarkable rise in the blood pressure occurs, this rise
 continuing until the normal tension is exceeded.              These observations
 prove beyond      doubt   that  the  first  cause   of  death   is not what it is
 usually supposed     to be,  and  as taught   in  the  text-books,  namely arrest
 of the heart and syncope, since, as you see, the heart goes on beating
 although the respiration has completely stopped.              Furthermore, if we
 quickly perform      artificial  respiration    we   obtain   recovery from the
otherwise fatal arrest.
     This suggests very strongly that the police and persons who are
trained in giving the first aid to the wounded should be taught that
with a gun-shot wound of the cerebral hemispheres, the proper thing
to do is to employ artificial respiration rather than the giving of
stimulants, &c. But, as you may well expect, the matter does not
stop here, nor is it so very simple, because we find that there are
certain conditions under which the secondary rise of blood pressure
does not occur.
     It is now quite evident that the fatal phenomenon of the gun-shot
wound of the cerebral hemisphere is in the first instance cessation of
the breathing, and       I  have now to indicate in detail how this is
produced by     the  hydrodynamic disturbance evoked within the skull
cavity by   the   energy of the bullet.       It is perhaps necessary to first
remind you       that  the   upper    part   of   the spinal cord or medulla
oblongata   contains   the  chief  centre   for  the  movements of respiration.

238     Prof. V. Horsley  on Destructive Effects  of Projectiles. [April  6,
I would   also draw your attention to the fact that therein is also the
centre of origin of the vagus nerve, which nerve has the power of
slowing the heart.       Thus there are two important centres in the
medulla which are liable to be affected by changes of tension around
them induced, as above stated, when the bullet traverses the cerebral
hemispheres in a transverse direction.        It may be that the centres
are principally affected by the mechanical pressure of the explosive
effect, but this latter of necessity produces a certain amount of
anaemia of the nerve centres ; some of the effect may also be produced
by that condition too.     Supposing that the artificial respiration has
been properly carried out, and the respiratory centre is revived into
activity, there is yet another condition to be overcome, without which
the animal or person dies, and for a long recognised reason, namely,
that the bullet having in its passage cut through various blood
vessels, blood is poured out within the skull, and consequently raises
very severely the intra-oranial tension.     This constitutes, as a matter
of fact, a second cause of death, for under these circumstances the
accumulated blood causes such severe compression that it not only
again paralyses the respiratory centre but also irritates the vagus
centre, causing a marked slowing of the heart.            The proof of the
truth of this statement is given at once the moment we cut the vagi
nerves, for if these are divided the heart immediately resumes its
former rhythm.     The next curves are to exhibit the increase in the
intra-cranial tension, which occurs the moment the bullet enters the
skull.     The line drawn by the Marey's tambour shows a violent
increase of pressure at the moment of shot (first or explosive effect)
and a certain recoil therefrom, this recoil being directly ehajged for
a steady increase in tension brought about by the secondary cause of
death, namely, the haemorrhage, of which      I  have already spoken.    To
treat such haemorrhage only ordinary surgical measures are requisite,
but these will be impossible if the activity of the respiratory centre
has not previously been restored in the manner already indicated.
    To sum up, the basis of scientific discussion of the nature and
causation of the phenomena evoked by bullet wounds of the cerebral
hemispheres must rest on two principal factors — the velocity of the
projectile and the development of hydrodynamic movement in the wet
 living tissues.
      I am glad to have had the opportunity of laying before you the
 facts on a subject which combines the pleasure of pure physical
 research with the interest inseparable from the resolution of patho
 logical problems.

                     Electric Discharge through  Oases.
On* of the most important and interesting branches of physical
science is that which deals with the connection between electrical
and chemical effects.
    The investigations on electrolysis made within these walls by
Davy and Faraday proved that the important class of electrical
phenomena associated with the passage             of electricity through
liquids, are connected in the closest way with chemical action. They
proved that no electricity will pass through most liquids unless
chemical action occurs, and that for each unit of electricity which
passes through the liquid there is a definite amount of chemical
decomposition.
     This case, though it is one where the laws are most accurately
known, is but one among many electrical phenomena which are
inseparable from chemical action.
     So many instances of this kind have been discovered that we
may perhaps venture to hope that we are not far from the time when
it will be universally recognised that many of the most fundamental
questions in chemistry and electricity are but different aspects of one
and the same phenomenon.
      Anything which throws light on the connection between elec
tricity and matter, interesting as it is on its own account, acquires
additional interest when regarded as elucidating the connection
between chemical and electrical effects, and no phenomena seem
more suitable for this purpose than those which are the subject of
the discourse this evening — the discharge of electricity through gases.
 For in gases we have matter in the state in which its properties
 have been most carefully studied, while the investigation of the
 electrical effects is facilitated by the visibility of the discharge,
affording us ocular, and not merely circumstantial, evidence of what
 is taking place.
      The points to which    I wish to refer particularly this evening are,
 firstly, some phenomena connected with the passage of electricity
 from the gas to the electrode, or from tho electrodo to the gas ; and
 secondly, some of the properties of the discharge when its course lies
 entirely in tho gas.

     By taking a long discharge tube, say, one 50 feet long, and observing
the luminous discharge through a rotating mirror, we can trace the
course of the luminosity due to a single discharge, say, one due to
once breaking the primary circuit of an induction coil ; if we do so
we find that the luminosity follows the direction of the positive
current through the tube. That is, the luminosity begins at the
positive electrode, it then rushes down the tube with enormous
                                                   velocity,   but when it

                                                   I  hope to show you later
                                                   on, as long as it keeps

 sometimes enunciated on this subject, call a ridiculously small amount
 of resistance, its real difficulty is to get out of the gas.
     Though this effect has long been known, it is so important that          I
 will venture to show one or two experiments which illustrate it.
 The arrangement of the first experiment is shown on the screen, the
 apparatus consists of a main discharge tube, across which is fastened
 a diaphragm made of excessively thin platinum leaf; there is a side
 passage from the tube, leading from one side of the diaphragm to the
 other, this is connected to a barometer tube, and by raising the

1894.]              on Electric Discharge  through Oases.             241
cistern containing the mercury     I  can stop np the passage by a pellet
of mercury.      We will first observe the discharge when the side
passage is open ; you see that the discharge, instead of passing across
the thin piece of platinum leaf, takes the very much longer route
round the side tube, so as to avoid crossing the metal.     We will now
raise the mercury cistern and close the side tube by a pellet of
mercury; the discharge now has no alternative but to cross the
metal at some part of its course, and you see that the main portion of
the discharge goes back into the main tube.
     In the second experiment the metal diaphragm is replaced by a
very thin plate of mica ; when the side passage is opened the discharge
goes round, but when this is closed by a pellet of mercury the dis
charge prefers to go across the mica than through the mercury.
     A second experiment which shows the same thing is the following.
Two long electrodes are fused into a bulb, so that the tip of an elec
trode is a considerable distance
from the place where it passes                     RS *'
through the glass. We will
now send an alternating dis
charge through the tube, and
you will see, 1 think, that the
discharge, instead of going
straight across the short dis
tance between the ends of the
 electrodes, goes from the tip  of^         JT
one electrode to the place                                 ~2EE^E3~
 where the other passes through
 tho glass, thus staying as long
as possible in the gas before
 passing into the metal.      The
 appearance    of  the  discharge
 shows that the positive electrode is at the end of tho wire,
 negative at the junction of the wire with the glass.
     Another interesting example of the difficulty the discharge
 experiences in passing from gas to metal is the discovery made by
 Professors Liveing and Dewar, that when the discharge passes
 through a gas containing a large quantity of metallic dust, the light
 from the discharge, when examined in the spectroscope, does not show
 any of the lines of tho metal.
      Tho difficulty which the positive electricity finds in passing from
 the gas to the electrode depends a great deal upon the nature of the
 gas, as well as upon that of the electrode ; it is influenced by the
                                                                          /
 position of the gas and the electrode relatively to one another in
  the electro-chemical scries.
      I have lately made a series of experiments on this point in the
 following way. An alternating discharge from a high tension trans
 former was made to pass between two electrodes fused into a bulb,
  which could be filled with the gases under examination.         Another

242                      Professor J. J. Thomson             [April  18,
electrode connected to an electrometer, passed into the bulb, and was
arranged so that it could be moved about from one part of it to the
other.   When the electrodes were metal and the bulb was filled with
the electro-negative gas oxygen, the electrode received a positive
charge in whatever part of the bulb it was situated ; if now the bulb
was filled with hydrogen at atmospheric pressure, then in the regions
remote from the arc the electrode received a positive charge, but in
the immediate neighbourhood of the arc itself it received a negative
charge.    When the pressure was reduced the region in which the
charge was negative contracted, and finally at pressures about one-
third of an atmosphere, seemed to disappear, and the electrode got a
slight positive charge in whatever position it was placed.      If now,
instead of using metallic electrodes we use well-oxidised copper ones,
and repeat the experiment in hydrogen, working at a pressure when
there was only positive electricity when the electrodes were bright
and polished, we find that with the oxidised electrodes every particle
of positive electricity is taken out of the tube, and a negative charge
is left.   This negative charge remains until the copper oxide is
completely reduced ; when this occurs the negative charge disap
pears, and is replaced by positive.     Thus, under the same conditions
as to the nature of the gas and the pressure, the bright copper elec
trodes leave a positive charge in the gas, while the oxidised ones
leave a negative charge.
     The most probable explanation of these results seems to me to
be the view that the communication of electricity from gas to the
electrode, or from the electrode to gas, is facilitated by the tem
porary formation of something of the nature of a chemical compound
between the gas and the metal. In all such compounds the metal is
the electro-positive element, and has the positive charge, the gas
being the electro-negative and carrying the negative charge.        Now
consider the case when the negative charge is on the gas, and the
 positive charge on the metal ; then the gas and metal have got the
charges proper to them in any compound they may form, and are
 thus in a fit state to combine, or, according to this view, allow the
negative electricity to pass from the gas to the copper.      But, now,
suppose the gas was positively electrified, the gas and the metal have
now opposite charges to those proper to them in a compound, and
before the union of gas and metal in this state could result in
 anything but a most unstable compound, an additional process must
 be gone through — i. e. the charges on the gas and metal must be
 interchanged.    Thus the conditions for the combination of the gas
and metal are more complex when the gas is positively electrified
 than when it is negatively electrified, and thus, on the view that the
 communication of electricity between the gas and the metal involves
a sort of chemical combination, we see that the negative electricity
 will escape more easily from the gas to the metal than the positive.
Now consider the case when the gas was hydrogen, the electrodes
oxidised copper ; the hydrogen combines now not with the metal, but

with the oxygen, forming water, in which hydrogen is the electro
positive element ; thus, in this case, it is the positively charged
hydrogen which is in the state best fitted for pairing. The conse
quence is, the positive charge would be most readily removed from
the gas and the negative left —exactly the opposite to that which
occurred when the electrodes were bright. This reversal, as      I stated
before, is verified by experiment.
     I have hitherto only spoken of the phenomena which accompany
the passage of electricity from the electrode to the gas, or from the
gas to the electrode.
     I shall now pass on to consider the properties of the discharge
when it is entirely confined to the gas.
     We may produce a discharge which, during the whole of its
course, shall be confined
to the gas in the way
represented in the dia
gram.
     The two poles of a
 Wimshurst machine are
connected to the insides
of two jars A and B,
 while the outsides of
these jars are connected
 together by a metal wire
wound so as to form a
coil.     The    electricity
from     the   Wimshurst
machine charges up the
jars, the difference of
potential    between the
poles increases until a
spark passes.     The pas
sage of the spark puts the
insides of the two jars in
connection, and the jars are discharged.      The discharge of the jar, as
was proved from the theory of electro-magnet action by Lord Kelvin
more than forty years ago, and shortly afterwards confirmed by the
experiments of Feddersen, is an oscillatory one, producing currents
surging backwards and forwards through the wires with extraordinary
rapidity. The subject of these oscillatory currents is one which in
this year is tinged with melancholy. The year had hardly commenced
when we lost Hertz, whose splendid work on these electrical oscilla
tions is known to you all. The Managers of this Institution have
marked their sense of the importance of this work by devoting a
special lecture this session to this work alone, and they have
entrusted that lecture to a most distinguished worker in the same
field as Hertz. It would therefore be presumptuous on my part to
refer in any detail to Hertz's work, but no physicist, and least of all

244                              Professor        J. J.   Thomson                      [April 13,
one who 'is a member of Maxwell's University, could pass over in
silence the death of Hertz.
     When Hertz began his magnificent experiments on electric
oscillations, there were many theories of electrical action. When he
had finished them there was only one, Clerk Maxwell's.
     Hertz's work was done with very much quicker vibrations than
those produced by the apparatus now on the screen ; this, however,
gives rise to currents through the coil changing their direction some
million times a second. If we place in the coil an exhausted bulb
the bulb in reality will be the secondary of an induction coil, and
will be exposed to electromotive forces tending to produce circular
currents parallel to the plane of the coil.
      I  will now place a bulb inside this coil, and you see that a
circular ring discharge passes through                        it,
                                                      and this discharge passes
entirely    in  the gas.

                                                                    is

than any others      I possess.
      If this ring discharge passes through air at different pressures,
the colour of the discharge changes very considerably.                   The first
bulb  I   put    in was   at  fairly  high  pressure,  about  -^  of    millimetrea
or so.     I will now put in another at lower pressure, and then one at
                                                      a
a   still lower pressure. Mr. Newall, who has been working at the
spectra of these discharges, finds that at the pressure in the first bulb
the spectrum is due to nitrogen               at the second stage
                                                  ;                         due toit   is

there      in the bulb
           is              a certain quantity of mercury vapour.
     The apple-green colour in the more highly exhausted bulb                  due          is
to some compound of sulphur, which has got into tho bulb from the
sulphuric acid used to dry the gas. Mr. Newall finds that if the
ordinary discharge from            coil between electrodes
                                     a                           taken in such

bulb, there     is no trace of this sulphur spectrum.         He has also found
that when the bulb              at a pressure intermediate between what
                                is                                                               I
may     call   the  mercury     and the sulphur stage, when the mercury
and sulphur lines are both visible, these sets of lines come from
different layers, the sulphur lines coming from                 layer nearer the
                                                                         a
surface than the other.
     If we take the discharge through bulb containing oxygen you

few bright lines.          If we take the discharge through cyanogen you
see that the glow         even more persistent than the oxygen, though
                          is                                                                     it
is  not so bright     ;  all the gases which show this glow belong to the
class of substances which polymerise — that is, whose molecules can
combine with each other.              imagine that what takes place in bulbs
filled with these substances         is I
                                       that the discharge produces      polymeric a
modification, and that this gradually returns to its original state,

and while doing so gives out a phosphorescent light. It is in accord
 ance with this that at a high temperature where ozone cannot exist
 a discharge through an oxygen bulb does not show any glow.
     I  said at the beginning of this discourse, that gases were ex
 ceedingly good conductors of electricity.       I will now endeavour to
show an experiment which proves that statement. The apparatus
         I
 which shall use for this purpose is a slight modification of the one
1 have used for producing the ring discharge ; the only difference is
that in the wire connecting the two coatings of the jars there are
two loops instead of one.        In one of these loops an exhausted bulb
 is placed to serve as a kind of galvanometer ; the brightness of the
discharge is an indication of the strength of the current flowing
round the coil.       If I  place a second conductor in the other loop,
currents will be started
in it and part of the i                            Fig ¦*¦
energy of the discharge
will be absorbed ; this
will leave less energy
available for the bulb
in the first, so that the
discharge in this bulb
will be dimmer. The
effect produced on the
discharge    will depend
upon the conductivity
of the substance placed
in the second loop.
     The effect is not
directly proportional to
the     conductivity,     in
fact, a perfect conductor
would not produce any
diminution, nor would an
absolute non-conductor;
for a given period and
with apparatus of given dimensions, there is a certain conductivity
which gives a maximum effect ; this follows easily from the theory of
induction of currents, but at this late period in the evening        I will
take a shorter course and prove it by an experiment.
     I put a piece of brass in this loop, and you see it produces but a
small effect upon the brightness of the discharge.        Instead of brass,
1 now insert a plumbago crucible, which, though a conductor, is not
nearly so good a one as the brass, and you see the discharge in the
indicating bulb is completely stopped.
     I will now place in the second loop an exhausted bulb ; you see
it produces a decided diminution in the intensity of the discharge in
the galvanometer bulb.        I  now replace the bulb by another of the
same size containing       dilute sulphuric acid ; you see it does not

246                       Professor   J. J.   Thomson                  [April   13.
produce nearly so large an effect as the exhausted bulb : this might
be due, as we have seen, to the sulphuric acid being either too good
or too bad a conductor.     Ican show that it is the latter by putting a
bulb in filled with a stronger solution, which has a higher conduc
tivity than the weak solution ; if the smallness of the effect produced
by the weak acid were due to its being a better conductor than the gas,
then increasing the conductivity would still further diminish the effect
of the acid, you see, on the contrary, that the strong acid produces a
distinctly greater effect than the weak, hence the rarefied gas in the
bulb is a better conductor even than the strong electrolyte.         Let us
consider for a moment the molecular conductivities of the two sub
stances, the rarefied gas and the electrolyte.    The pressure of the gas
is about i^5 of a millimetre, while in the electrolyte there are sufficient
                             molecules of the acid to produce, if they
                             were in the gaseous state, a pressure of
                             more than 100 atmospheres ; thus the
                             conductivity    of the gas estimated per
                             molecule is about 10 million times that
                             of the acid, this is greater than the mole
                             cular conductivity of even the best con
                             ducting metals.
                                  If the pressure of the gas is diminished
                             below a certain point, the conductivity
                             begins to diminish.          I
                                                        have here an ex
                             periment    which       I
                                                    hope will show this.
                           o The    apparatus (Fig. 5) consists of two
                           o bulbs, one outside the other; the inner
                             bulb contains air at a low pressure, while
                             the space between the two bulbs is a
                             very high vacuum containing practically
                             nothing but a little mercury and its va
                             pour.    The amount of mercury vapour in
                             this space        is,

forces.   We now try the experiment you observe that when the

quite dark ; the outer layer is now a conductor, and by its action

                            Early British Races.
Before proceeding to trace the early history of man in Britain it is
necessary to refer briefly to the physical changes which geologists
tell us have occurred since the close of the Tertiary period in the con
figuration and temperature of the north-western portion of Europe.
     At the beginning of the Pleistocene period the temperature of
Northern Europe became colder, and an ice cap, like that which now
covers Greenland, gradually extended itself probably as far south as
 Middlesex and covered the greater part of Wales and the northern
half of Ireland. This is known as the Great Ice Age. At that time,
 the land being more elevated than now, Great Britain and Ireland
formed part of the continent of Europe, and the western coast-line
 extended some three or four hundred miles further into the Atlantic
 Ocean than it does at present.       This period of cold was gradually
 succeeded by a more genial one, during which, but before the ice had
 disappeared, a great depression and submergence of the land took
 place, varying from about 600 feet to over 3000 feet below the present
level at different parts of the country, but least in the south of England.
 The climate again became colder, and on the higher parts of Wales,
the north of England and in Scotland glaciers were once more formed,
but not to the same extent as formerly. Then followed, in late
 Pleistocene times, a re-elevation of the land to at least 600 feet above
 its present level, and Great Britain and Ireland once more became
joined to the Continent, and the climate became temperate. In all
 probability the geographical conditions of Britain, or rather the
 British corner of Europe, in early and late Pleistocene times were
 almost identical.      Finally the land connection with the Continent
became    severed   by submergence till almost the present coast-line was
reached,   and  the  sea once more rolled in over the beds of the German
Ocean    and  the  English Channel.     These changes in the geographical
conformation of the north-western part of Europe took place slowly,
and were consequently spread over an immense interval of time.
      According to some eminent geologists, man first took up his
 abode in the British portion of Europe, either during the early
 Glacial or Pre-glacial Period. The evidence of his existence here at
 that early period rests upon the discovery of many flint implements

  1894.]                   on Early British Races.                     249
 of peculiar and special type on certain high chalk plateaux in Kent,
  in drift resting on Pleiocene beds, in drift deposits of Norfolk and
  Suffolk, and in certain caves in which glacial drift is believed to be
 deposited over the flints.    All these implements are of the rudest
 make, more or less stained, like the drift flints with which they are
 associated, of a deep brown colour.         They show a considerable
 amount of wear, as though they had been rubbed and knocked about
 a good deal, so that the worked edges are commonly rounded off and
 blunt.    In few instances have they been wrought out of larger flints,
 and the amount of trimming they have received is very slight, and
 has been generally made on the edges of rude natural flints picked up
 from old flint drift ; indeed, sometimes the work is so slight, as to be
 scarcely apparent, in other specimens it is considered by some suffi
 cient to show design and object. These implements indicate the very
 infancy of art, and are probably the earliest efforts of man to fabricate
 tools and weapons from other substances than wood or bone. They
 give us some slight insight into the occupations and surroundings of
 the race who used them, as they appear to have been used for breaking
 bones to extract the marrow, scraping skins, and rounding sticks and
 bones for use as tools or poles. From the absence of large massive
 implements, it would seem as though offensive and defensive weapons
 had not been much needed,         either from tho absence of large
 mammalia, or from the habits and character of these early people.
 Many archaeologists are not satisfied with the evidence yet adduced as
 to these flints being of the early date claimed for them, consequently
 of man's existence in Britain at that time, and regard the implements
just described as belonging to the early part of the next period.
     Whatever may be the ultimate decision arrived at as to tho
age of these flints, all geologists and others are agreed that after
the Glacial period had passed away and Britain had once more
become a part of the continent of Europe after its submergence, a
race of men known to us as Palaeolithic man migrated into the
country from the Continent, across the valley of the English Channel.
Man of this period is known to us from various remains of him
found in drifts of Post-glacial age, and in the lower deposits of
certain caves.     As some evidence has been brought forward to show
that the River-drift people, as they are called, are earlier than the
Cave-dwellers, we will consider the remains of the former people
first.
     Remains of man from British River-drifts have only been found
in the south of England from Chard, Axminster, and the Bristol
Channel in the west, to the Straits of Dover, the lower Thames,
Suffolk and Norfolk on the east, and as far north as Cambridge.
They are conspicuous by their absence north-west of a line passing
from Bristol to the Wash. The remains consist of a small portion
of a skull reputed to be of this period, implements of flint, quartzite
and ohert. antlers of deer, and of certain fossil shells, probably used
as ornaments.

     The portion of skull was found by the late Mr. Henry Prigg, in
1882, at Westley, in Suffolk, seven and a half feet from the surface,
in a pocket of brick earth eroded in the chalk, and in an adjoining
pocket two molar teeth of mammoth and four Palsolithic fliut im
plements were found.* The fragment of skull was part of the vertex,
and included the upper portions of the frontal and parietal bones
with part of the coronal and sagittal sutures. It was examined by
Mr. Worthington Smith, and in transit back to the finder of it was un
fortunately smashed. As it was not a characteristic part of the skull
it shed little light on the cranial characters of its owner. With this ex
ception, no human bones have been found in fluviatile deposits in Britain.
     The implements from the River-drift consist principally of oval-
pointed flints which have been fashioned by chipping, and were used
without handles, oval or rounded flints with a cutting edge all round,
scrapers for preparing skins, pointed flints used for boring, flakes
struck off from blocks or cores by means of large hammer stones,
often of quartzite, and choppers of pebble chipped to an edge on
one side. The tools with which these implements were manufac
tured consisted of anvil stones of large blocks of flint, pointed flints
or punches, and carefully made fabricators.               All the implements,
though simple and rude, show signs of manufacture, the more finely
finished specimens having been prepared by delicate chipping.
Their manufacture seems to have been carried on at certain localities
on the banks of rivers, and other places where there was plenty of
material from which to make them. It will be observed that at this
time there were no flint arrow-heads, and that man was but poorly
equipped for the chase, although it was undoubtedly by that means
he gained his livelihood.        Besides these flints man doubtless used
wood and bone implements ; pieces of pointed stakes made of wood
have been found on the Paleolithic floors where he worked by Mr.
 Worthington Smith.       Bead-like fossil shells of Coscitwpora globulosa
have also been found by Mr. Smith, with artificial enlargement of
 their natural orifices, among his implements, which would indicate
that they had been used for necklaces or ornaments, so that he
seems not to have been unmindful of his personal adornment even at
 that early time.
     It is of importance to consider for a moment the animals which
lived with man at this period. There are found in the same strata
with him remains of the hippopotamus, two species of elephants and
of rhinoceros, the cave bear and lion, the wild cat, hyena, urus, bison,
 the wild horse and boar, stag, roe, reindeer, and other animals, many
 of which are now extinct. Man at that time had no domestic animals.
 The only clothing he had, if he wore any, was made from the skins
 of the animals he killed in the chase and used for food. Being far
from the sea, if he used fish as food, they would be such as he was
able to catch in tho rivers.

     Let us now trace man of this period on the Continent. In the
fluviatile deposits of the Somme and the Garonne stone implements
have been found and recognised by such competent authorities as Sir
John Evans, Mr. Franks, Professor Boyd Dawkins and others, as
identical with the drift Palaeolithic implements found in England ;
similar ones have been found in Spain, near Madrid, in Italy, Greece,
Germany and other places in Europe, also in Northern Africa,
Palestine and India. From these finds we learn that man has lived in
a similar state of civilisation to what he did in Britain, over a very
wide area ; they also show that he must have remained iu this stage
of culture for a very long time ; but they give no evidence that the
places where they are found were once inhabited by one and the same
race of people, as might be inferred from some authors.
     As regards his skeletal remains on the Continent, but few have
been found.      At Canstadt, near Stuttgart, it is stated that a portion of
a skull was discovered in 1700, in deposits presumed to be of Palaeo
lithic age, with bones of the cave bear and hyena, and mammoth.*
At Eguisheim, near Colmar, Schaffhausen, a portion of another
cranium was found with mammoth and other animal remains of this
period.      At Clichy, in the valley of the Seine, a skull and some
bones were found at depths varying from 4 to 5-4 metres from the
surface, in undisturbed strata, with mammoth, woolly rhinoceros,
horse and stag. The skull in these instances is long and narrow in
shape, with prominent supra-orbital and glabellar ridges ; the thigh
and leg bones of the Clichy skeleton are laterally compressed, the
former having a greatly developed linea aspera, the latter being
markedly platjcnemic.           Futher reference will be made to these
specimens when we deal with the Cave skeletons.
     Caverns and rock shelters are well known to have been used not
 only by man but also by animals from remote times down to the
 present day.      The strata which have been deposited in them at
different times by their successive occupants and the vicissitudes of
climate are often well marked and give much valuable and reliable
information, but great care is required in discriminating the different
periods, which their contents represent.         The remains of Palaeolithic
man deposited in caves are much more widely distributed over
 England than thoso from the River-drift, having been found as far
north as Yorkshire and Derbyshire, in North and South Wales,
Gloucestershire,      Monmouthshire,      Somersetshire      and Devonshire,
also in Ireland, although these latter have not been much worked.
The Palaeolithic Cave stratum shows three sub-strata, in the two
lower ones the flint implements are precisely similar to those of the
    * Since this was written Prof. Boyd Dawkins has informed      me that in the
original record of the finds made at Canstadt in 1700 there is no mention of this
skull having been found, and that the first mention of it having been found
with them is in 1835. M. Cartailhac gives this later date as that when the
skull is first mentioned.

River-drifts, but flat pebbles of quartzite are also found with part of
 the natural smooth surface retained, while the rest is chipped and
 fashioned into an implement.     In the upper sub-stratum more highly
finished articles, which would point to a higher and probably a
different social condition later in time, are obtained.      We have in
 this higher substratum flints of a lanceolate form, trimmed flakes,
borers, and rounded hammer stones. These are of smaller size than
 the earlier implements, and some of them had evidently been let into
handles of wood. Bone needles, with an eye bored at one end, bone
awls, scoops, and harpoons barbed on one or both sides made of deer's
antler are also met with. Of great importance are the representations
of animals which have been found incised on bone, as for example,
the portion of rib with the incised figure of a horse upon  it,found in
this layer in Robin Hood Cave in Derbyshire.
     No portions of the human skeleton have been found in the
Palaeolithic stratum of British caves, except  a single tooth.
     On the Continent many caves have been discovered in France,
Belgium, Germany and Switzerland, with similar deposits and
implements to those found in England, and showing also the same
two stages of culture.     More numerous examples of figure carving
of the same type as that found in the Derbyshire cave, have been
obtained in French caves, and the teeth of carnivorous animals and
shells, both artificially bored for ornaments.
     By associating British and Continental evidence, we can form     a
good idea of the mode of life of the Cave-dwellers of Paleolithic times.
The caves gave him shelter in cold weather, from which he also pro
tected himself by fires, and clothing made from the skins of animals
secured in the chase, sewn together by means of bone needles threaded
with shreds of the tendons of reindeer. Armed with flint-tipped spears,
and daggers of bone ornamented with carved handles representing the
chase, he lived by hunting the reindeer, the wild horse and the
bison ;  he also lived on birds and fish, which he speared with barbed
harpoons.    The game brought home was cut up with flint knives and
cooked, and the long bones were broken with heavy flints for the
 marrow they contained, which was evidently considered     delicacy.

 The manufacture of the flint implements he used when engaged in
 the chase must have formed an important part of his work.      The
ornamental carvings on bone which he frequently made show that
he was an artist of no mean order in depicting animals, but give us
little information regarding his own morphology, as they seldom
bear representations of himself — when they do, only his miniature
outlines are figured naked the carvings also show that he was in the
                            ;
habit of wearing long gloves to cover his hands and arms. Probably,
he painted his body of  a   red colour, and ornamented himself with
perforated shells, pieces of bone, ivory and teeth. Like the River-
drift people he possessed no domestic animals, not even      dog to
                                                               a

     In Continental caves human skeletons of this period have been

 found ; of these, perhaps, the best known is the famous Neanderthal
 one, from a cave near Diisseldorf. Upon this skeleton alone it would
 not have been prudent to have based the characters of Palaeolithic
 Cave men, because the circumstances under which it was found have
 given rise to some doubt as to its being of this age, and it is
 considered by some to belong to the next period which we have
 to deal with.     When it is taken in conjunction with others pre
 senting similar characters, and regarding which there can be no
 doubt as to the age to which they belong, the evidence it affords is
 considerably strengthened.         The find of two skeletons at Spey in
 Belgium in 1886 has been most important, both in advancing our
 knowledge and confirming the characters ascribed to this race from
 various less complete specimens.           The cranium of the Neanderthal
 skeleton, though very imperfect, is long and proportionately narrow
 in form, having a cephalic index of 72, the glabella, brow ridges,
 and external orbital processes are enormously developed, the fore
 head is remarkably flattened, the occiput is prominent, and the
 elevation of the whole vault is extremely low.                The skulls of
 both the Spey skeletons are also long and narrow, one having a
 cephalic index of 70, and the other of 74- 6, the superciliary
 ridges, and also the glabella, are very prominent, the frontal sinuses
 are large, the external orbital processes are thick and projecting, the
 ridges on the frontal, parietal and temporal bones for muscular
 attachments are strongly developed, the occiput is prominent with a
 well marked " torus
                       " at the junction of the curved muscular
                                                                        ridges,
 which are also large, the cranial vault is low and flattened from above
downwards, and presents an antero-posterior curve very similar to the
 outline of the side of an ellipse ; the malar bones have thick and
broad orbital processes, the orbital cavities are deep, and the orbital
breadth is but slightly inferior to the width, the zygomatic arches
are large.    The size of the lower molar teeth increases from before
backwards, the first molar being the smallest, and the last molar the
largest.    The lower jaw shows no prominence of the chin, indeed, it
recedes somewhat from the alveolar border downwards, and has
a symphesial angle of 111°.          It is thus a counterpart of the Naulette
mandible, which presents         similar    characters, both as regards the
molars and the symphesial angle.             The stature of the Neanderthal
skeleton, estimated from the length of the femur, is 1 • 640 metres
(6 ft. 3 in.), and from the humerus 2 centimetres less ; that of the
Spey skeleton (there being only one of these in which the long bones
could be measured), estimated from the femur and tibia, is 1 • 504
metres (4 ft. 11   J  in.), and from the femur alone, 1- 640 metres
(5 ft. 0f in.). The stature of the    ¦
                                          Naulette skeleton, that of a woman,
estimated from the     ulna,  is   1   433   metres (4 ft. 4J in.), and shows
that she also was very    short.
     The long bones of the upper and lower limbs of the Neanderthal
skeleton are characterised by their unusual thickness and the great
development of the elevations and depressions for the attachment

of muscles, the articular ends of the femur are of larger size than
usual.     The femur of the Spey skeleton is more arched forward
than usual, somewhat flattened from side to side in section, and the
articular ends are of large size, especially the lower, in which there
is enormous antero-posterior development of the articular surface of
the condyles.     The tibia is actually and proportionately very short,
flattened laterally, and therefore platycnemic.        The bones generally
are remarkable      for their   stoutness,  and  indicate  that the muscles
attached to    them   were  large   and   powerful, especially those of the
lower limb. In respect to the platycnemism of the tibia, the Spey
skeleton corresponds to the Langerie Basse and Madelaine bones
from the Perigord Caves, and confirms in a very positive manner the
evidence of their surroundings and relics that Palaeolithic people
were sons of the chase, as it is connected with the development of the
tibialis posticus muscle, and not a race character.
     Portions of skulls and skeletons found in various parts of the
Continent, associated with Palaeolithic implements and animal remains
of late Pleistocene times, support the peculiar race characters of the
specimens just described.        The osteological remains of Palaeolithic
age   now  in hand,  from  different  parts of the Continent, seem to me to
afford sufficient evidence of the existence both in drift and in cave
deposits of a race of men possessing physical characters quite distinct
from those of the Neolithic period, which we will next consider. The
assertions which have been made at various times with respect to
individual specimens being more or less pathological, will, to my
 mind, not hold good when we find specimen after specimen from the
 same deposits showing similar characters.         It may not be possible in
some cases to establish the fact that the specimen cannot have been
 deposited at a later period in the stratum in which it is found, but a
careful examination of each specimen, such, for example, as Professor
 Topinard has made of the mandible from Naulette, shows anatomical
conditions which, not in one respect, but in several, indicate as
 distinctly as his implements the progress of man's evolution, and
 preclude the idea of this type being a variety of the Neolithic people.
 The specimens of Palaeolithic man seem to me to show identity of
 race, whether they have been found in the River-drift or in the
 Palaeolithic stratum of caves.       The idea of Professor Boyd Dawkins,
 that the implements found in the River-drifts and later Palaeolithic
 deposits of caves give evidence of there being two Palaeolithic races,
 is not supported by the osteological remains yet to hand. From
 extensive examination of ancient British skeletons,       I do not consider
 that there is any evidence of the existence of the direct descendants
 of Palaeolithic man among the osteological remains of Neolithic or
 subsequent date in Britain.       Here he seems to be as extinct as many
 of his contemporary animals of the late Pleistocene period ; this,
 may or may not be the case with respect to his existence in other
 parts of Europe.     Whether he has still representatives in America, as
 surmised by Professor Boyd Dawkins and some American anthropo

1894]                     on  Early British Races.                    255
logists, is an interesting question, but does not come within the scope
of this lecture.
    The next period at which we find remains of man in Britain is
separated from the previous one by a space of time measurable only
by the changes occurring in the interval.      Great Britain and Ireland
had again become islands almost of the same dimensions as at
the present day, but with a moister and more continental climate
— hotter in summer and colder in winter — abundant forests extending
as far as the extreme north of Scotland, and numerous morasses and
peat bogs. Not less significant was the advance in civilisation man
had made since Palaeolithic times, as we now find him dwelling
in fixed habitations, with a knowledge of the arts and agriculture,
with domestic animals, and with stone implements not only of the
earlier type but of a much more developed character, as he had
now learned to smooth them by grinding and polishing.
    These Neolithic people, as they are called, lived on the tops or
aides of hills or in suitable valleys.     Their camping grounds were
intersected with numerous drains or ditches, which would show that
the climate was moist.      Inside the camp they hollowed out pits, in
or round which they dwelt.        From these camps have been obtained
spindle whorls and bone combs toothed at one end, showing that
they were acquainted with the arts of spinning and weaving, bone
needles, fragments of coarse pottery made by hand and not turned
on the wheel, either plain or ornamented with simple lines or dots,
bones of the roe, red deer, dog, goat, short-horned ox, horse, pig, &c.,
and fish, but no trace of metal is found. Of all their implements the
stone axe is, perhaps, the most important.         Flints used for imple
ment-making were now often quarried from below the soil, with
antlers of deer as picks.       The implements were distributed over
districts far removed from where they were made, probably by
barter ; thus, Jadite or Nephrite implements have been found in
Britain, which Mr. Budler has shown were probably obtained from
Switzerland, Silesia or Styria.      They possessed canoes formed out
of the trunks of trees, in which they probably reached this country
from the Continent.
    They buried their dead in caves which had been used as
dwellings, in their camps, and in chambered and unchambered
barrows.    The most characteristic British barrows of this period are
of long oval shape, and often of large size, but Neolithic interments
are also found in circular barrows.         The dead were buried in a
contracted or crouched position, and, with them, stone and bone
implements of various kinds, and pottery, which would seem to show
that these articles were intended for the use of the dead or their
spirits. Relics of art in the form of carvings are seldom found, and
are very inferior to those of late Palaeolithic times.
    Osteological remains of the Neolithic people are distributed all
over Britain, from the south of England to the extreme north of
Scotland.    They are most numerous in the south-west of England

  especially in Wilts and Gloucestershire, the part of the country
  occupied by the Drobuni or Silures at the beginning of the historic
  period. They have been found in considerable numbers in Yorkshire,
  Derbyshire and Stafford. Huxley and Wilson have described the
  same race from horned cairns in Caithness, and from other places in
  Scotland.     I have described them from Wiltshire, Middlesex, York
  shire and from Orkney.
      There is some doubt of their existence at an early period in
  Ireland, as Professor Macalister informs me that he has not recog
  nised them, and no long barrows are found there. Sir William
  Wilde, on the other hand, recognised Neolithic skulls from
 Somersetshire, as identical with certain ancient Irish skulls. Any
 skulls from Ireland       I  have seen which havo shown characters
 similar to the Neolithic skulls from England, are of later date, but
 Huxley describes them from chambered tombs, peat mosses and
 river deposits of Ireland, of the long, narrow type.      I think we may
 conclude as regards Ireland, that although it is doubtful whether the
 Neolithic people were there at as early a date as in Britain, certainly
 they were there later.
      The characters of the skeletons are well marked. The skull is
 large and well formed, the calvaria is long and proportionally
 narrow, having a cephalic index of about 70, and of oval shape.
 The superciliary ridges and glabella are moderately or even feebly
 developed, the forehead is well formed, narrow, and curves gracefully
 to the occiput, which is full and rounded.         The upper margins of
 the orbits are thin, and the malar bones are never prominent, the
 profile of the face is vertical, and there is no tendency to prog
nathism, the chin is prominent, tho symphcsial angle is from 70° to
 80°, the length of the face from the root of the nose is comparatively
 short, but, as a whole, it is oval in form ; the jaws are small and fine,
 the teeth are of medium size, and generally in a good state of preser
 vation, not much worn down ; the last molar is the smallest tooth of
 that series. The facial characters are mild, and without exaggerated
 development in any one direction ; the same may be said of the cal
 varia generally. The age of the persons to whom they belong averages,
 according to Dr. Thurnam, forty-five years, which would seem to
 indicate that the duration of life at that time was rather short.
      The stature of the Neolithic people is short.             From Dr.
Thurnam's measurements of the femora of twenty-five skeletons, it
averages 1*674 metres (5 ft. 6 £ in.) by Bollet's formula, but from
my own observations on other specimens which have passed through
my hands,     I  am inclined to consider this is too high an average.   In
their general characters the bones are slender, often with a well
marked linea aspera on the femur and platycnemic tibia, which would
show that the Neolithic people still led a very active life as hunters.
Dr. Thurnam has noted that sometimes two or more of the cervical
or dorsal vertebrae have a tendency to anchylosis, but       I cannot say
that   I have ever seen this.

     On the continent of Europe remains of the Neolithic people are
 found chiefly in caves, and show much the same state of culture and
 physical features as just described, as for instance the well-known
 Cro-Magnon and Engis skulls, but the sequence of their existence
 there is not so well defined as in Britain, where they held, appa
 rently, undisputed possession of the country for a considerable
 period.    Indeed, it is only lately that Continental anthropologists
 have admitted their priority to that of people presenting the
 characters of the next race we shall have to deal with.
     From the evidence to hand, it seems probable that the Neolithic
 people at one time occupied the whole of the west of Europe ; and     I
 agree with several other observers in considering that they are to be
 identified with the old Iberian race, of which the Basque may be
 considered a remnant.       There    is,

     Unlike Palaeolithic man, the Neolithic people have never become
 extinct in Britain, and their descendants exist to the present time.
It true that subsequent invaders drove them in many instances to
  is
particular parts of the country, where they remained isolated for a
long period, as early history and the excavations of General Pitt
Rivers and others show, but skeletons from ancient tombs indicate
that they also mixed with their conquerors.        The observations of
several anthropologists show that they are associated with the short,
dark-complexioned, and dolichocephalic people found in considerable
proportions in some parts of the country, especially in certain parts
of the west of England.
     The next people to appear upon the scene previous to the dawn
of history, are those who were in possession of the greater part of
Britain at the time of the Roman invasion.       They came into Britain
from northern France and Belgium at         aconsiderably earlier period,
and gained possession of the country from the Neolithic race. These
are the so-called Celts.   Their advent     marked by the introduction
                                            is
of the use of metals into Britain, and they are associated with the
Bronze Age. From the custom they had of interring their dead
(whom they chiefly cremated) in barrows of a circular shape, they
are often known as the Round Barrow people. They show         a  marked
advance in civilisation beyond that of Neolithic times, as they were
agriculturists, and lived by tilling the soil        they manufactured
                                                     ;
weapons and ornaments of bronze and richly decorated pottery           ;
their flint implements also were of better make, as evidenced by
their beautiful barbed arrow-heads.     To this period belong many of
the curious Lake dwellings found all over Great Britain and Ireland,
Picts' houses of Scotland, and Bee-hive houses of Ireland.
     Their osteological remains show that the skull was large, with
strongly developed superciliary ridges and glabella, the brow well
formed and broad, the upper occipital region not projecting, the
tuberosity being the most prominent.        In general form the brain

bones   are prominent and large.   The jawbones are large, macrogna-
thous, and likewise the teeth, which are often much ground down ;
the profile of the upper jaw is somewhat prominent, which gives a
prognathous look to the skull ; the chin is well formed.      The face,
as a whole, is of an angular lozenge form.     The ridges for muscular
attachments both on the cranium and face are well developed, and
the expression is very rugged and savage like.      Thurnam estimated
from the skulls the average age of the persons interred in the Round
Barrows to be fifty-five years, while that of the Long Barrows was
ten years less.
     The stature of the Round Barrow race averages 1*747 metres
(5  ft. 9 in.), which is more than the mean stature of the population
of the British Isles at the present day. The limb bones are large,
with strongly developed ridges and depressions for muscular attach
ments.
     This race is everywhere to be found over Great Britain and
Ireland, and, although conquered by the Romans and subsequent
 invaders, forms a very important element in the population to the
  present day.

The Italians have a proverb which runs, " Dove non va il sole va il
        "
medico — Where the sun does not enter the doctor does — and which
may be taken as an expressive summary of the experience of a people
who have had opportunities of learning by many and varied trials how
important for health is a due exposure to sunlight. Moreover we find
the same proverb, in almost the same form, in the Provencal dialect
— " D» lo misou ent6 n'entro pa lou sonle riebo lou medeci "— and that
this empirical recognition of the sanitary powers of sunshine is
common to many nations, and every one who has resided in India and
the East knows how naturally the servants expose clothing and other
articles to the direct rays of the sun.
    In answer to the question, "Does the above proverb, and its
equivalents in the languages of other peoples who have much to do
with intense sunshine, really imply any knowledge or suspicion of
the direct action of solar rays on organic materials or objectionable
living beings? we are no doubt justified in replying, No.               If
they have thought about the matter at all, the people have assumed
that the heat of the sun's rays and the ordinary action of the air are
the factors concerned ; and that it is no doubt a sort of mixed effect
of dryness and ventilation that is to be aimed at when they expose
the interiors of dwelling rooms, soiled clothing and so forth to the
                    " aired," as they have it.

    On the other hand, we find that experience of similarly varied and
often bitter kind has also taught the children of sunny climates that the
very brilliant sunshine which they so correctly extol as efficient in
purifying their houses and apparel is a dangerous enemy to human
beings who are unduly exposed to the direct solar rays.            All the
painful experience connected with snow-blindness, sunburn and sun
stroke may be invoked in support of this statement, and it requires
but a careful study of this subject to be convinced that in these cases
at any rate the effects cannot be put down to the mere heating power
of the sun's rays.
    Closer examination of the whole question drives us to the con
clusion that the effects referred to, and many other effects of direct
insolation, are not due to the heat rays at all, but to actions of quite
other kinds induced by rays long unsuspected of having anything

like the hygienic importance     they really have. But it has required
much careful experimental investigation to decide this matter, and      I
propose to show you some of the principal steps in the chain of
proof.
    The fact that bacteria, which would multiply at an enormous rate
in certain organic liquids, as, for instance, dilute meat broth, cease
more or less evidently to do so if the fluid containing them is
exposed to intense sunshine, was first pointed out by Messrs.
Downcs and Blunt in 1877 and 1878, and further experiments
have abundantly confirmed their result.      The establishment of this
truth led to a more or less desultory controversy, turning on the
question whether the effect was merely one of relatively high
temperature, or whether it was really due to the light rays — in
othor words, whether those rays of the solar spectrum known to us
especially by their thermal actions, induced the death of the insu
lated bacteria, or whether other rays of the solar spectrum were
concerned.
    This controversy was brought virtually to an end by the various
experiments of Downes and Blunt, Arloiug, Janowsky, and others,
who showed that in many cases at any rate the bacteria in the tubes
of broth, &c, were either killed outright, or rendered almost inca
pable of further development in ordinary daylight, or in tubes cooled
by ice, or — in later experiments —in tubes behind screens which cut
off the heat-rays to such an extent that no question of temperature
could possibly be raised.
    Meanwhile, another controversy arose, and was also carried on in
a more or less disjointed    manner through a series of years. This
turned on the question — granted that the bactericidal effect is not
due to high temperatures, may it not be merely the result of some
poisoning effect of certain substances produced in the food-medium
(broth, &c.) under the oxidising effect of the air in the illuminated
tubes.
                    I
    Duclaux was, believe, the first to assert this definitely, and it
was regarded by many as confirmed by experiments performed by
Roux in 1887. It was pointed out that certain rays — more especially
thoso towards the violet end of the spectrum, and known popularly as
                 "
the " chemical     rays— are very apt to promote oxidative decomposi
tions in solutions of organic substances, such as the broth used for
cultivating these bacteria. It was also shown that the death of the
bacteria in question did not result if all traces of oxygen are
removed from the tubes previous to insolation.       It had also been
rendered at least highly probable — though there was as yet no agree
ment on this point — that certain rays of light only, some thought
the red, others the blue-violet rays, are especially concerned in the
process. The conclusion drawn, therefore, was that the effect was
primarily due to a poisoning action of the broth or other food-material
due to the energetic oxidations promoted in it by the solar rays when
exposed to the light of the sun.

     Meanwhile, other questions were being asked by those who were
 not satisfied with this explanation, or in the ordinary course of
 experimental inquiry into the subject.
     It had already been decided that Downes' and Blunt's experi
ments could not be accepted as conclusive, because they were not
 conducted with pure cultures, but with mixed infections of various
 bacteria, the growth or non-growth of which was decided merely by
 inspection of the turbidity or otherwise of the broth.    Duclaux was
one of the first to use pure cultures in 1885, and Arloing about the
same period showed that some injurious effects on the spores could
be induced by artificial light, such as strong gas-light, though it did
not kill the bacteria.
     Then Geissler in 1892 came to the conclusion that the light from
a powerful electric arc-lamp has some retarding action on the typhoid
bacillus, though it was much feebler than direct sunlight, a result
confirmed later by Chmelewsky, thus making it probable that the
action of light on these organisms is merely dependent on the kind or
intensity of the rays and not on the source of the light.
     But the most interesting controversy was that which had mean
time arisen concerning which of the various rays of the spectrum
are the really effective— or the most effective ones.
     That the various rays of the solar spectrum act differently on
plants, has long been an established fact in Botanical Science, and
the experiments of Famintzin, Batalin, Sachs, Pfeffer, Paul Schmidt,
Naegeli, Pringsheim, Elfving and others have put beyond doubt
that it is of material importance to an ordinary plant not only
whether it is excluded from or exposed to light, but also whether the
light to which it is exposed contains the normal proportions of the
various rays known to us in the visible and invisible spectrum, or is
deficient in some of these.
     To mention one or two illustrative cases only. The highly
refrangible rays in the blue-violet region of the spectrum have a
powerful effect on the processes of growth proper in a plant,
and in heliotropic curvatures of the growing parts, whereas the
process of carbon-dioxide assimilation is chiefly dependent on the
less refrangible red-orange rays at the other end of the spectrum.
Again, the infra-red rays, if only in virtue of their thermic effects,
are known to be of importance in growth, though in quite a different
way from the rays above mentioned ; while Sachs has given reasons
for believing that the invisible ultra-violet rays at the other extreme
of the spectrum have quite different effects again in the development
of coloured flowers, and so on.
     It was natural, therefore, to raise the question whether all, or
only some, and if so which of the rays composing the solar light are
effective in retarding and killing bacteria — especially when wo
remember that bacteria are plants — or at any rate that many of the
organisms so denominated belong to the vegetablo kingdom.
     Two methods have been employed for the purpose of answering

262                          Professor  Ward                   [April 27,
this question.    The first, employed by Downes and Blunt, Arloing,
Janowsky, Geissler and Kotljar, was to use screens of coloured
glass, or coloured solutions, &c., behind which tubes of broth or
other liquids containing the bacteria were placed, and to judge of
the effect by comparing how rapidly the broth became turbid ; or
behind which gelatine tubes, or agar or potato cultures             were
exposed, and a rough estimate made as to how well or ill the bacteria
grew on the surfaces.
     The second was to place such tubes in the various regions of the
spectrum, and compare the results, as before, by judging of the tur
bidity of the broth, or the rate of growth on potato, &c. &c.       This
method was employed by Arloing, Janowsky, Chmelewsky                 and
Geissler.
     Quite apart from other drawbacks to any such methods as these,
and while fully recognising their historical necessity as pioneer work,
it is obvious that no very accurate results could be expected from
them, and as matter of fact we find up to 1892 that opinions were
so divided on the question which are the effective rays, that no
definite conclusion could be drawn.     For instance, Arloing could not
distinguish the action of any one particular set of rays from that of
others, while Gaillard concluded that all the rays have a feeble effect.
Santori concluded that neither the red nor the violet rays are the
active ones, whereas Janowsky thought both the red and blue-violet
were the effective rays.
     ltoux and Duclaux thought the action was due to a poisoning of
the bacteria by products of oxidation of the food-medium, while
Arloing and others insisted it was a direct action of the light. Some
denied the facts altogether, or believed that all the light did was to
retard the germination of the spores ; while others insisted that the
bacilli are more easily destroyed than the spores, and that it was all
an obscure matter of temperature.        In fact, previous to 1892, the
utmost confusion existed, and all kinds of statements were current
on the subject among the very small band of observers who concerned
themselves at all with it ; the best indication of the want of definite
knowledge being, perhaps, the silence of the text-books on the
matter.
     The fact is that the methods in use up to that period were inade
quate for the solution of the problems that had arisen, and many
cautious bacteriologists were consequently sceptical as to the bacteri
cidal effects of the sunlight, or indeed any light at all.
     During the course of my investigations into the vitality of the
anthrax bacillus when its spores are left in water,    I was struck with
the rapidity with which the bacillus disappears from tubes exposed
to the sunlight, a fact often observed before, and recorded by Straus,
Buchner, Momont, Frankland and others, and usually supposed to
be due to the spores germinating out into tender bacteria, which are
then killed off. This is by no means the case, however, for the spores
are themselves so acted on by the light-rays that they become incapable

of germinating at all — they are directly killed by some injurious action
set up in their interior by certain rays, and this at temperatures much
lower than that we are now employing, whereas these spores are nut hilled
by mere boiling for a minute or two, and will withstand for hours, and
even days, temperatures far higher than any they are subjected to in the
experiments   I am going to describe.
     In  experiments where the spores of Bacillus anthracis were left
in distilled water exposed to light for a few hours, it was found that
many of the spores died, while of those which were left the germi
nating power was very much weakened. If, for instance, a number
of spores were distributed in pure distilled water, and thoroughly
shaken up, and the infected water was then divided into two portions,
one exposed to light and the other not, every sample drop taken
from the former tube was found to contain far fewer living spores
than any sample drop from the latter.         This confirmed the results
observed by others, and already referred to — the sunlight in some
way kills the spores, even in pure water.
     It was further noticed that if I mixed a drop of the freshly
infected water with sterile gelatine or agar, and then poured the
liquid transparent mass on a shallow glass dish, and allowed it to
set or stiffen there into a transparent film, considerable differences
 were observable according as such a plate-culture was left exposed to
the light or covered up from it.
     In the latter case each of the numerous invisible spores contained
in the drop of water, and now evenly distributed through the trans
parent mass of solidified gelatine, &c, germinated out in a few hours,
and formed a colony of bacteria so dense and opaque that the
 previously clear gelatine, &c., became studded closely with them, and
 looked as if peppered over with a dense cloud of dust ; whereas in
 the former case the light was found to have killed so many of the
spores that only a very few colonies were formed on the plate ut
 wide intervals, and separated from one another by the portions of
 transparent gelatine in which no growth had occurred.
      Plate-cultures shown illustrating this.]
     5 t must be borne in mind that the gelatine, which remains trans
parent in this case, is just as richly charged with spores as in the
 other case, only the spores remain invisible owing to their minute
ness ; they are dead, and therefore cannot germinate and grow and
 develope into the colonies which render the gelatine, &c, opaque.
     It was pretty obvious that if the light was the agent which thus
killed the exposed spores, the effect ought to be better brought out
by exposing part only of the gelatine plate, and covering up the rest.
This I did as follows, by a modification of a method long known to
botanists and practised by myself for years.         A large quantity of
spores was thoroughly shaken up in distilled sterile water, so that
every cubic centimetre of the water contained from 1,000,000 to
5,000,000 of the invisible spores. Then about 5 drops of this
 water was mixed with gelatine, warmed until quite liquid, and the

264                          Professor Ward                      [April 27,
whole rapidly poured in an even thin film over the flat floor of one of
these thin clear glass dishes. In five or ten minutes the gelatine had
set to a thin transparent film, containing say 5,000,000 invisible
spores. The bottom of the dish, outside, was now covered with a zinc
stencil-plate, through which a letter of the alphabet (say E) was cut,
and every other part of the dish wrapped over with tin-foil and black
paper, so that no light could reach the film except that which passed
through the E-shaped opening in the metal stencil-plate in contact
with the thin glass on which the gelatine film rests.
     [Demonstration of method of making and exposing such plates.]
     The plate, letter downwards, was then suspended over a plane
silvered glass mirror, placed at an angle such that the rays of the
sun could be reflected up vertically through the letter, for two, three
or more hours.
     After this process of exposure, the coverings and stencil-plate
were removed from the plate, and the latter put in a warm dark
incubator.    The film showed no effects, but was still an even trans
parent sheet of gelatine, because the spores, dead or alive, are so
minute that they in no way perceptibly interfere with the clearness
of the gelatine, and none have had time as yet to germinate out.
     On allowing such an exposed plate to remain, in the dark, at a
 temperature suitable for promoting the germination of the living
 spores, however, a marked and striking result is obtained in from
 twenty-four to forty-eight hours or so ; for it is found that those spores
which lie imbedded in the parts of the gelatine sheltered from the
light, by the foil and other coverings, have germinated out normally
and developed into visible colonies, which render the gelatine opaque,
and which are so numerous that they run into one another, and so
produce a general grey, white or other coloured layer, according to
the kind of bacterium, &c., used, whereas those spores in the E-shaped
area exposed to light do not alter, because they are dead — killed by
the light — and therefore do not affect the clearness and transparency
of the gelatine, being invisible on account of their minuteness.
     Consequently we see a transparent letter E picked out from an
opaque matrix of growing bacteria.
     [Photographs and plates shown.]
     Buchner, by a method essentially similar to this, showed that a
few hours' exposure to the intense light of the sun in summer suffices
               I
for this, but showed that the much feebler rays of the winter sun
are capable, even after reflection from a mirror, of totally killing
the spores of the anthrax bacillus, at a temperature so low that even
the gelatine ordinarily employed in cultures, and which runs at
29° C, is not melted. Since the spores employed will withstand very
much higher temperatures — 55° C. to 60° C. — for many hours, it is
clear that these experiments are conclusive against the supposition
that the bactericidal action is due to the temperature.             Having
established     this point for this and a number of other forms,
including some mould fungi and yeasts, the next step was to settle

 1894.]           on the Action    of Light   on  Bacteria and Fungi.           205
 the question whether the light-action is really direct on the spores,
 or dae to some poisoning action owing to products of oxidation of
 the food-materials.
      This problem       I   attacked in the following manner.         Spores were
 shaken np in pure water, and the mixture poured into sterile shallow
 flat glass dishes — the Petri dishes used for plate-cultures — and dried
 there in a hot oven at 60° C. to 70° C, or even higher ; this does not
 injure the spores, but renders them air-dry, and they stick as a thin
 powdery film to the bottom of the plate in this condition.
      I  then prepared several plates of agar films, sterile and without
 spores, and proceeded further according to the following argument : —
 If the solar action depends on the formation of some poisonous
 oxidation product in the agar, then, if           I  expose one of these sheets of
 agar, covered with a stencilled letter, to the sun, and then superpose
 it on an un-exposed film of the spores only, the latter ought to refuse
 to germinate on the letter-shaped area of the agar which had been
 exposed, whereas they should grow on the parts of the agar which
 had been protected from the sun.
      But on trying the experiment, such proved not to be the case.
 On the contrary, the spores germinated equally well all over the agar
film, on the parts exposed as well as on those not exposed. In other
 words, the agar is not rendered in any way a worse pabulum for the
 spores by exposure to the sun's rays — a fact quite in accordance with
 numerous other experiments           I  tried.
     This result by        itself,  however,    is far less conclusive than when
 taken    with  the  reciprocal experiment, as follows :—
     Side by      side  with the sterile agar film above referred to, also   I
 exposed     a  film   of   the dried spores — without agar — for the same
 period,   and   under    the   same conditions as to covering, stencil-letter,
 &c. If, now, the solar action is direct on something in the spore
 itself, then those spores in that letter-shaped area of the film to which
 the stencil-plate allows the sun's rays to have access, ought to be
 killed : consequently, on superposing a non-exposed film of agar on
 to one of these exposed films of spores,              I  ought to obtain a trans
parent     letter   after   the   spores   around    have  grown out into opaque
colonies.
     And such proved to be the case, as the accompanying photograph
 shows. [Experiments and photographs demonstrated.]
     These reciprocal experiments taken together, conclusively show
 that the light-action is really direct on the spores themselves, and
that the solar rays do not perceptibly affect the food-value of the agar
films.
     The same result is also obtained by taking some of the germinating
spores from the non-exposed parts of a gelatine or agar plate in the
 previous experiment, and placing them on the exposed area where all
 the spores have been killed : they grow and flourish on this exposed
 area as well as they do on the non-exposed one, whence may be
inferred that the bactericidal action, whatever it is, is not a mere

consequence of poisoning         from outside.     It is evidently due to the
light-rays directly inducing         some  changes in the substance of the
spore    itself.
      The practical hygienic importance of this discovery is considerable,
and would not be diminished even if it had turned out to be true that
the light-action was really on something at the immediate surface
of the spore ; for it is clear that when spores escape into the air, and
are exposed to the direct rays of the sun, they run exactly the risks
I   here subjected them to, and, as matter of fact, we find it is of the
utmost importance in bacteriological investigations not to allow the
 spores of bacilli, fungi, &c. (even when fully ripe and otherwise fit
 for keeping in dry tubes, &c., for years), to be exposed to the light,
 for under such circumstances they gradually deteriorate.
      Now we can see why it is so essential to health that our streets,
 houses, clothes, &c., should be thoroughly exposed to the sunshine.
 Moreover, as will be clearer in the sequel, these experiments render
 intelligible why it is that epidemics of parasitic fungi are so often
 connected in people's minds with dull, cloudy, sunless weather, and
 the Italian proverb with which         I   opened this lecture has for us a
 meaning far deeper and more significant than it had before.
      It is evident that the foregoing method is capable of application
 in several different directions, and           Inow proceed to attack the
 problem as to which rays of light are most effective in the process of
 destroying living germs, on entirely new lines.
      Starting from the thought that all the older attempts to compare
 the growth in two or more tubes exposed to different coloured lights
 are open to the criticism that it is impossible to be sure that each
 tube-culture is alike at the commencement, and extremely difficult to
 contrast them as growth proceeds, it was obviously a step forward to

 plate culture.         I
                      This did in various ways, but the following is one
 of the most instructive.
      A block of vulcanite is cut in the shape of a Roman capital E lying
 on its back LU , and a thin glass plate is cemented to each side : this
  gives a double celled screen, of which each cell is equal as regards
 depth of liquid poured in, kind of glass, and so on, points of more
  importance than may appear at first sight.          Having prepared such a
  screen with, say, clear water in one cell and the orange-coloured solu
  tion of bichromate of potassium in the other, an agar plate of spores
  is made and two stencil-letters placed on         it,
                                                    so arranged that one letter
is   covered by each cell of the screen.
      [Screen apparatus of various kinds shown and explained.]
       On exposing such     a   screened plate, one of course gets the com
  parative    effects of the same  light, acting at the same temperature, for
  the same period on the same culture       :  the one condition altered being
  that certain rays — in this case the blue-violet —are cut off by the
  bichromate screen.

   By thus using various coloured solutions capable of cutting off
certain rays of light — their behaviour in this respect being carefully
determined by spectroscopic examination —in the one cell of the
double screen, and water in the other,            I was enabled to show very
clearly the comparative action of the coloured light and the unde-
composed light passing through water, and to establish the following
conclusions.
   There is no perceptible bactericidal action behind any screen
which cuts off the blue-violet rays, whereas the action is the more
pronounced the more these rays are transmitted.             It matters not how
much of the red-orange and yellow end of the spectrum is trans
mitted, so long as the blue-violet end is cut off by the screen the
spores are not killed at the ordinary temperatures.             Results entirely
confirmatory     of  these  were  also   obtained  with glass screens,  although
I  now lay less stress on these, because they are in some respects less
satisfactory for exact quantitative results, owing to the variations
which glass screens show as regards their capacities for absorption
and radiation.*
      [Photographs of exposures behind other screens.]
     Numerous experiments were also made, with screens and without,
to test a number of other points of discussion which arose during the
progress of the investigation — e. g. how long an exposure was
necessary to kill all the spores ; how far temperature aids or combats
the destructive effects of the blue rays ; and so on. In these cases
screens of quartz, alum, quinine, esculin, rock-salt and various other
substances were used, and a number of interesting facts obtained as
to details.
     During the course of the inquiry as to the time necessary, it was
found to be useful to photograph the plate after exposure in order to
                                                                       "

parts of the agar film germinated out and grew into colonies, the
opacity of which showed up the clear figure of the exposed area
by contrast: and some suggestive facts were elucidated by these
experiments.
     On unwrapping the exposed plate nothing is visible at first, as
already explained, but after twelve to twenty-four hours or so at a
suitable temperature in the dark, the spores on the non-illuminated
parts of the plate gradually produce a faint grey opacity around the
exposed area, which is so far a clear ill-defined patch. In the course
of another twelve to twenty-four hours or so the outlines of the letter
or other shaped area begin to show more definitely, and the figure can
be recognised, and later on it becomes sharper and sharper as the
contrast between the more and more opaque and dense bacterial

growth around, and the clear area containing the invisible dead—
killed — spores becomes greater.
     In certain cases, especially on very hot sunny days, when the
light is particularly bright, it is found that the image is blurred for
a long time, owing to the retardation (not death) of the spores in the
immediate neighbourhood of the margins of the figure. The explana
tion of this phenomenon seems to be that the excessively intense light
passing through the stencil letter and the transparent floor on which
the spore-laden agar-film rests, is partly reflected and slightly diffused
from the surface of the glass lid of the Petri dish, and this reflected
light is still strong enough to have some effect, and consequently the
spores nearest the margins of the area through which the light comes
are retarded, but not killed.
      [Demonstration of the gradual development of the figure during
incubation. J
      Another phenomenon of interest here is that a few spores here
and there sometimes escape being killed, even on the most exposed
parts of the illuminated area, and after a few days slowly grow out
into feeble colonies. For some time this puzzled me considerably.
 It is clearly not evidence in support of any poison theory ; but it
 seems very simple if we suppose these spores to have been so
 disposed that a number of other spores, vertically situated between
 them and the incident rays of light, sheltered them more or less
 completely — a disposition quite possible when we remember the
 millions of spores present in the film — and so saved them from
 complete destruction.      And all the evidence points to this being the
 right explanation.
      It only remains to be added here that all the effects already
 referred to can be got with the electric arc-light, instead of with
 solar light, but there are some difficulties in employing this source
 of radiation which may easily lead to the erroneous conclusion that
 the electric light is less efficacious as a bactericidal agent than sun
 light. The principal of these is that, as we shall see, glass in any
 form is powerfully obstructive to the rays required.
      It occurred to me at an early stage in this investigation — in fact,
  my earlier efforts were especially directed to this end — that the most
  direct answer to the question, What rays are the really effective
  ones ? ought to be best obtainable by shining the spectrum itself
  directly on the film of spores, and making the latter record the effects
  themselves, by their subsequent behaviour, according as red, yellow,
  blue, &c., rays foil on them. For, obviously, if the spores are killed
  by blue-violet rays, and not injured by red and yellow ones, those
  spores which lay in the blue, &c., of the spectrum ought to die, and
  the agar remain clear, while those in the red, &c., ought to grow and
  render the agar opaque, and so on, and         I ought to obtain a photo
  graphy   in living and dead bacteria, of the spectrum   itself I
       It is too long a story to go over all the difficulties and disappoint
  ments incident to the preliminary trials; but the ultimate success

1894.]        on the Action   of Light   on Bacteria and   Fungi.          269
was so astoundingly    complete and instructive that       I must   give some
account of it.
     The chief difficulty to be overcome here is the great weakening
of intensity of the dispersed rays of the beam of light decomposed
to form the spectrum ; for not only are we here distributing the
incidence of the rays themselves over a larger area, but they are
passing through lenses, prisms, &c., which absorb or reflect many of
them. This, of course, has to be compensated by condensing the
beam and exposing for longer periods ; but even then, when anything
like a pure spectrum is employed, the slit has to be so narrow that
relatively little light can be utilised. Consequently, the exposure
has to be much more protracted than with undecomposed light.
     Then came in another difficulty. It was found, when working
with the electric light, that very feeble effects could be got as
compared with those produced by exposure to the solar rays on a
clear blue day, and the reason of this is that the blue and violet rays
are stopped to a large extent by the glass surfaces through which tho
rays must pass.      The effect of the glass is practically the same as the
effect of mist or haze, Ac, in the atmosphere, which so filters out
the blue-violet rays, that the light of a dull day is of little effect in
my experiments.
     During the progress of the experiments        I had the good fortune
to obtain the aid of Professor Oliver Lodge, who was so kind as
to expose a large number of my plates to a powerful electric arc
for me, with most satisfactory results.        The difficulties referred to
were got over by employing quartz instead of glass — the lenses and
prisms were of quartz and a quartz plate was used for covering the
agar film with its embedded spores.
     In this manner it was possible to obtain a very pure spectrum
sufficiently rich in blue and violet rays to kill the spores in a few
hours.
                              I
     With the solar rays, found it quite easy to obtain satisfactory
results in the summer, however, even with glass mirrors, lenses and
prisms, and exposures of five to six hours, though in winter           Ifind
the exposures necessary are so long as to be almost impracticable.
    I   will first describe the experiments with the solar spectrum
which    I made at Cooper's Hill this last summer.
                                                       it,
     The plate of agar, with spores or bacilli in      is   made exactly as
before, but instead of the ordinary glass lid   I   employ   a sheet of thin
flat ground glass, in which       slot
                                  a      cut about three inches long by
                                         is
one inch wide.      This slot     covered by either
                                  is                   athin sheet of glass
or a   plate of quartz.    The whole of the covered plate — except the
slot described —  is  then protected from the light by black paper and
tin foil, andis   then laid, bottom downwards, on      abox kept cold with
ice, in such a  position that the spectrum falls vertically across the slot,
the coloured bands crossing the long axis of the slot at right angles.

      The red rays are made to fall across, say the left end of the slot,
starting about half an inch from its extremity, then come the orange-
yellow and green, then the blue and violet, the end of the visible
violet being about an inch from the right end of the slot. Beyond
the visible red, to the left, the invisible infra-red rays are falling
on the plate, and beyond the visible violet, to the right, fall the
invisible ultra-violet rays.
      Owing to the obstruction of the glass, however, very little of what
ultra-violet escapes absorption in the atmosphere reaches the agar-
plate itself ; though, as we shall see, a good deal of the large propor
tion of these rays which emanate from the electric arc are incident on
the plate provided no glass is employed at all.
                       I
      The plate which now have thrown on the screen [Photographs of
solar spectra in bacteria] was thus exposed for five hours in August to
 the spectrum obtained by decomposing a beam of solar light reflected
 from the mirror of a heliostat, and you see that the result is a most
 satisfactory proof (1) that the infra-red, red, orange and yellow rays
 are totally without effect — as shown by the bacteria exposed to these
 rays having germinated and developed as rapidly and as strongly as
 those in the dark ; (2) that the bactericidal effect occurs in the blue-
 violet region, diminishing in intensity at both ends as we pass into
 the green (to the left), or into the ultra-violet (to the right) ; (3) that
 the most destructive rays are the blue rays to the right and the violet
 rays.
       These results are — if we allow for differences of absorption in the
 screens, &c. — entirely in accordance with my screen-experiments, and
 prove most conclusively that the rays which kill the bacteria are the
 blue and violet ones.      This explains why      I find these organisms
 destroyed so much more rapidly by the light of the summer sun than
 in winter ; why a clear blue sky is so much more effective than a hazy
 one ; why direct sunlight acts so much more quickly than reflected or
  diffuse daylight; and many other experimental facts.           It will be
 noticed that no question of temperature comes in; the plates are
  exposed on ice, and the hotter regions of the spectrum are totally
  without effect —the bactericidal action is here emphatically due to
  rays which affect our eyes as blue and violet.       Now let us examine
  the results obtained with the electric spectrum.
       The methods are exactly as before, excepting that the light, con
  centrated by quartz lenses, is passed through quartz prisms, &c., and
  is not allowed to pass through glass at all, unless, as in the case 1 will
  select, a piece of thin glass is interposed for experimental purposes,
  to determine the difference in effect between it and quartz.       In this
  case two slots were cut in the glass lid, one of which was covered
  with thin glass, the other with quartz.          Everything else was as
  before. The plate was exposed for twelve hours to a very pure
  spectrum, and it brings out very clearly the following facts. [Photo
 graphs of electric spectra shown.]
      (1) That when there are plenty of ultra-violet rays, and no

 1894.]         on the Action  of Light on Bacteria and Fungi.         271
 glass is interposed, the effect extends far beyond the visible spectrum
 into the ultra-violet, to the right ; but, when even a thin sheet of
 glass is interposed it obstructs these rays, and the effect is like that
 of the solar spectrum, as the photograph shows.
      (2) It shows even more clearly than before that the infra-red,
 red, orange-yellow and green are without effect, and that the effect
 weakens as we pass beyond the visible violet, and
      (3) That the maximum bactericidal effect is due to the blue violet
 rays, for the bellying out of the cleared region about there is due to
 the action of these rays reflected from the interior of the plate, show
 ing that here alone are the reflected rays powerful enough to act just
 beyond the edges of the area.
      It is also worth notice how slight an obstacle suffices to cut off
 the ultra-violet rays, for the two small protuberances visible in the
 lower photograph are merely due to two little drops of the Canada
 balsam used for cementing the quartz to the glass having oozed out
 and overflowed beyond the edge of the slot —nevertheless, this
 sufficed to block out the rays there.
      These experiments will suffice to convince you that the blue-
 violet end of the spectrum is the effective one. They compel to the
 conclusion that the more        I  can expose the spores, &c., to the
 unobstructed rays, the more rapidly are the germs destroyed, and
 they show very clearly how fallacious may be the results where glass
 has to be employed throughout — a fact which will be impressed yet
more upon us as     I proceed.
      There is another thought which arises here, and that is, what a
poor chance such germs as these spores of fungi, yeasts, bacteria, &c,
must have if they were not shrouded from the solar rays by the
atmosphere 1 This reflection is not without its significance towards
certain wild hypotheses as to the origin of life on our planet.
      A more practical outcome of these results with the electrio aro
suggests itself in the probable efficiency of the naked arc light as a
disinfecting agent in hospital wards, railway and other carriages, &c.,
as   I   have pointed out elsewhere; and we cannot overlook their
significance in connection with such experiments as those of the late
Sir William Siemens on the application of the electric light in
horticulture, &c.
      If  now we look at these extremely suggestive experimental
results from another point of view, it is obvious that these incubated
plates showing the contrast effects between dead and living bacteria,
or bacteria partly killed, as the case may be, and according as they
have been exposed to light or not, or exposed to certain rays or to
others, or exposed for longer or shorter times, and so on, are really
photographs ; but they are photographs where the sensitive agent is a
living organism, such as a bacterium, in place of a merely chemical
substance, such as a silver salt suspended in a medium which acts as
a carrier — hore gelatine or agar, in place of the prepared gelatine to
the photographer.

     Tho plates    I  have shown you are really photographs in living
bacteria of the solar and electric spectra, only instead of being recorded
by the various stages of decomposition of the invisible particles of
silver salts, which are then treated by chemical solutions, &c., in the
processes of development, fixing, &c., they are recorded by the various
capacities for germination of the invisible spores, the image — i. e. con
trast effect — being then developed by my favouring their germination
and further growth into opaque colonies by the application of slight heat.
     If this is so, it ought to be possible to use such a film of bacteria
spores as a sensitive plate for printing from a negative, according to
the principles laid down, and just as a piece of paper or glass,
covered with a film impregnated with silver salts, &c., is used in
contact printing in photography ; and this, too,           I have succeeded
in doing. The chief difficulty to be overcome here is to bring the
film impregnated with bacteria sufficiently close to the gelatine
surface of the negative to be printed from, for of course it is
impossible to bring them in actual contact, since the bacterial film
must be kept covered by sterilised glass, &c., and the bacterial culture
kopt safe from contamination by spores in the air.            By employing
sheets of extremely thin glass, such as that used for cover-slips, how
ever, on which to support the bacterial films,         I have overcome this
difficulty, and now throw on the screen a photograph in living bacteria
of a piece of English landscape, printed from an ordinary negative by
throwing the solar rays, reflected from a polished mirror of speculum
metal, through the negative, the gelatine surface of which was only
separated from the bacterial film by such an extremely thin plate of
glass as  I have described.
     The bacterium employed was a beautiful purple one obtained
from the Thames, and which is very sensitive to light — so much so,
               I
indeed, that am convinced that with thin quartz plates         I could get a
print in half an hour on a clear day. In the case shown the exposure
was only two hours.
     It only remains to add that similar results with stencil-letters,
the solar and electric spectra, and photographs such as that described
have been obtained with anthrax, typhoid, several ordinary river bac
teria, and fungi and yeasts, and that — apart from details which need
not enter into discussion here — the general results are the same.
     In order to try and obtain a further insight into the physiological
and pathological phenomena concerned in this bactericidal action of
light, however, and in view of various disadvantages inseparable from
the employment of cultures in the mass,        I have attempted with success
to  trace the effects  of the  light on the individual bacterium cell itself,
isolated under the microscope.            To do this, some form of culture
chamber is necessary in which the organism can be grown in a minute
drop of food-material —such as broth, gelatine, or even water — and
can be kept under a high power of the microscope for some hours, or
even days if necessary.       This is managed as follows : —

    A glass tube about 3 inches long, has a bulge in the middle : this
bulge is ground down on two opposite sides so that it is pierced by
two large round openings.       One of these openings is placed down
wards on a piece of glass or quartz, and cemented to the latter by
                            I
any convenient means — usually employ paraffin : the other opening,
above, is covered by a thin piece of glass, to the under side of which,
in the centre, is hung a minute drop of the food-material containing
the spore to be examined. The two arms of this culture chamber are
stuffed with wet cotton wool, and a layer of water is placed on the
floor of this " damp chamber," and the whole is now ready for use.
All the materials employed have undergone the necessary cleaning and
sterilising, and with proper precautions there is no reason why such
a hanging drop, with the growing organism in                 it,
                                                           should not be
kept under observation until the latter has either exhausted all
the food supplies, or completed its life-cycle, in focus under the
microscope.
    When in position on the stage of the microscope, the light reaches
the organism through the glass or quartz, and of course            easy to
                                                                        it   is
arrange shutters, screens, &c., so that only the light reflected from
the mirror of the microscope below shall reach the drop and the
organism in it.     Again,      it easy to interpose coloured or other

length, it exposes a larger and larger surface of absorption to the
food-materials, and possesses more and more power of utilising them
 for further growth.
      If   two cultures such as those described are started at the same
 time, one under one microscope and the other under another by its
 side ; and if one condition at a time is varied for one of these
 cultures, then the differences in the curves ought to give us a very
 clear idea of the effect of the difference of condition on the growth of
 the bacillus — and we must remember that the rate of growth is our
 best criterion for the well or ill doing of the organism.
      It is, however, by no means an easy matter to vary one condition
 at a time in these cultures, and the principal difficulty of the whole
 of this more recent part of the research has been the attainment of
 this object as near as possible.
      The most prominent and annoying form in which this difficulty
 has presented itself has been the following: —        If I allow the sun's
 rays to be reflected up from the mirror into the culture-cell, in order
  to brightly illuminate the growing bacillus, the heat-rays at the
 red-end of the spectrum become effective in raising the temperature
 of the culture ; whereas the culture on the other microscope,
  protected from the light, is also sheltered from these heat rays, and
 consequently       the two cultures are not simply differing by one
  condition — it is not true that the one is growing merely in the dark
  and the other merely in the light, but the one is growing in the
  light at a higher temperature than the other.
       This and similar difficulties had to be overcome, and it was clear
  that some means must be devised for recording the temperature inside
  the culture cell, and this       I accomplished by placing a very small
  delicate thermometer, with its bulb blackened, inside the culture cell
          [Photograph and description of the control culture cells]
  itself, so that each time when the register of the length of the bacillus
  was taken, the temperature of the culture itself was also recorded.
       By these means      I have now succeeded in comparing the effect of
  light of oven low intensity by direct observations of the bacillus
  itself, under high powers of the microscope, and in comparing the
  curves of growth under various conditions of light and of tempera
  ture, and this, moreover, on a Thames bacillus, which is among the
  least sensitive of those which have yet come under my notice.
       Since the details of this investigation have not yet been pub
 lished, however,      I must content myself with a few references only.
      Just   to illustrate   how strikingly different the curves of growth

                                                       now throw on the
screen the curves obtained by measuring at intervals the growth of
two cultures of this bacillus, one under a microscope fully exposed to
the light, and the other under similar conditions, but in the dark.
                       [Photograph of curves shown.]
The temperatures recorded by the thermometers are given also ; but
I  do not intend to go into this matter here, as                 I
                                                    have a large number
of records bearing on the matter — which                   is,
                                                 moreover, an extremely
complex one.        wish you to understand, however, that the enormous
                    I
difference between these two curves       principally due to the differ
                                                is
ences in illumination, and that, as you see, the bacillus in the light
took as long to grow 200 units of length as that in the dark did to
grow 560 of the same units — in other words, the light retards tho
growth even of the actively vegetating bacillus,             fact quite in
                                                                         a
accordance with what we know of the growth of other plants.
Moreover,   I   find the curves of growth differ when the bacilli are
examined growing behind coloured screens, and in just the same way
as we should expect from the foregoing.
     The curves now shown wore obtained by measuring the growth of
         [Photograph of curves of growth in red and blue light.]
two cultures in the light, one behind     blue glass, the other behind
                                                a                             a
red one, and alum screens were employed to diminish the heating
effect.    Here, where bright sunlight was used,      took the bacillus in
                                                                 it
blue light the same time to grow 50 units of length that the one in
red light required to grow over 1200 units.
     And large number of similar experiments all agree in pointing
            a
to the same end — the light acts as       retarding agent on the growth
                                                a
of the vegetative bacillus, as well as injuriously on the germinating
power of the spores.       In both cases       the blue-violet rays which
                                                 it   is
are effective, and if these rays are sufficiently intense, or act for         a
sufficiently long period, they kill the organism in the manner we
have already seen.
     Undoubtedly the most interesting results have been some of those
obtained with light of relatively low intensity, acting on the spores
themselves. First let me show you the curves of growth of three
cultures of bacillus from the Thames which
                a                                     have been studying
                                                                 I
 for some time, in which the spores had been dried by placing them at
80° C. in   a hot oven, and allowing the temperature to fall slowly —         it
took two hours to cool to 30° C, as the best proof            can give you
                                                                         I
that these roasting hot temperatures do not injure the life of the spore,
and that the results to be described are in no way due to temperature.
[Curves of growth of spores dried at high temperatures.]
     As the curves show, these spores germinate as rapidly and well as
if merely ripened at the ordinary temperature and at once sown.
    I   may also add that the spores of the bacillus     am showing you
                                                                     I

damage,    though they do not survive prolonged boiling.            Here is
sufficient evidence, however, to prove that we are not dealing with
spores which are at all tender to high temperatures, but with forms
which are wholly unscathed by any such temperatures as they have to
endure on exposure to the sunlight.
     Yet an exposure of half-an-hour or so to the direct rays of the sun
kills these spores outright.
     But direct sunlight is not necessary, as the following experiment
shows. Four culture cells were prepared as described, each hanging
drop having a small number (about 15 to 25) of spores in             it,and
placed each with    a  thermometer control cell as follows. One was
under a   darkened bell jar  ;   second under
                                 a               alarge flat-bottomed glass
dish filled with clear water     ;  third under
                                     a           a similar dish filled with
deep-blue    ammoniacal    solution   of  cupric  oxide;    and the fourth
under a   similar dish of deep orange-coloured solution of potassium
bichromate.     [Demonstration of methods of exposure.]           The first,
therefore, was excluded altogether from the light, while the second
received all the light passing through water and clear glass.          The
third was exposed to the feeble light passing through the very
deep-coloured copper solution, and from which all red and yellow
rays were cut off; while the fourth was exposed to the red and
yellow rays only, all the blue-violet being excluded by the screen.
     Now mark the conditions of exposure, as recorded on the chart.
They were all outside, at the north, and in the shade of a building,
 so that no direct sunlight reached them at all — only the lights from
the blue sky and clouds   ;  moreover the temperature was low, and so
nearly the same in each culture cell as that of the surrounding air,
that even the most sceptical critic would not ascribe the results to the
minute differences, even  if  we did not know from the other evidence
that he would be wrong in doing so.
     These cultures were exposed for five hours as described, and then
all brought into the laboratory and placed in the dark at the same
temperature — 21° C. — temperature chosen as being the most favour
                         a
able for their further development.         After a sufficient interval of
time, the lengths of all the germinated bacilli in the drops were
measured, and the means and averages taken, and plotted on sectional
paper, with the results now shown.
     [Curves of average growth of these thrown on screen.]
     The results were that the spores which had been excluded from
the light and those which had been sheltered behind the bichromate
from all blue-violet rays, germinated out normally, and the bacilli
rapidly developed and grow those exposed to the blue rays (though
                                 ;
of feeble intensity) were so far retarded, that the curve of growth        is
markedly depressed while those exposed to the more intense light
                     ;
coming through the clear water, and therefore to more intense light
containing more of the blue and violet, were killed altogether, for
they refused to germinate in all cases and even after several days'
nursing.\

1894.]        on the Action of Light   on Bacteria and Fungi.             277
     Now the special interest of this new line of investigation       I  have
been   pursuing turns largely on the fact that this particular bacillus,
which is not uncommon in the river Thames, is by no means a very
sensitive one to light, as compared with several others known to me.
     For if such a form can be so easily destroyed in a few hours by
the light from an April sky passing through several inches of water
and two sheets of glass, we may fairly conclude that more sensitive
forms are easily destroyed in the river, exposed to the rays of a
summer sun during the long days of June, July and August.
     As matter of fact — and the fact has been confirmed by many other
observations — I found that in spite of the high temperature of the
past summer, which we should expect to favour the development of
bacteria ; and in spite of the river being low, and presumably more
concentrated as a food-solution for bacteria ; and, further, in spite of
the fair expectation that, per unit of volume, the water ought to contain
more bacteria than during the cold months of October, November and
December, when the river is more diluted, and so on ; the number of
bacteria per cubic centimeter is decidedly and markedly less in the
summer than in the winter months I
                                                               I
     This is very clearly shown by the statistical curves now throw
on the screen.
     [Curves of average number of bacteria per 1 cubic centimeter of
Thames water in August, October and December, 1893.]
          I
     Now am perfectly aware that it has been the custom to regard
this well-known fact as due to a series of causes of quite different
kinds, the action of which may or may not co-operate in bringing
about the variations in the quantities of bacteria per unit of volume in
such a river as the Thames, but      I  submit to you whether, in view of
the new facts     I have elicited, it is not at least highly probable
that the increased intensity of the light, acting during a longer period
through the summer days, is a very powerful agent in keeping down
the numbers of these bacterial and fungoid organisms in the river.
     It must be remembered that in my experiments, although get         I
such pronounced positive results wherever        I employ water enclosed in
glass vessels as the screen,    I  certainly do not get anything like the
effects that the same exposures give if     I dispense with the glass of the
containing vessels, mirrors, &c. ; for even a thin plate of glass is a
decided obstruction to the rays at the violet end of the spectrum, and
so  I have to record positive results considerably below what       I should
get if the light from the sun and blue sky reached the organisms
through the medium of water only.          In the experiments     I am now
continuing, no glass whatever is employed, and the light is not
allowed to traverse or be reflected from any but quartz or metal
surfaces.
     Unfortunately, we are as yet but scantily informed as to how far
the blue-violet rays penetrate into deep water, but experiments by
Regnard, Fol, Forel and others have shown that they do penetrate
to a considerable depth.     Fol, for instance, showed that some light

 278                             Professor Ward                    [April   27,
 gets down as    far as 400 meters, and Forel got effects with photographic
paper   at 45   to  100 meters in the Lake of Geneva, and so on, depths
quite   sufficient   for my purposes, though    I hope that more accurate
and extended information will yet be obtained on the subject.
     Some consequences of this view of the destruction of bacteria in
water by light are of the utmost importance.          For instance, we can
understand how the typhoid bacillus, if it falls into turbid dirty
water in the summer, may multiply at the high temperature and at the
expense of the food-materials dissolved from the organic matters in
suspension, and this at its pleasure, so to speak, because the sus
pended particles of matter, to which the turbidity is due, favour it in
(1) supplying it with food, (2) absorbing heat and helping to raise
the temperature of the water, and (8) impeding the penetration of the
destructive light-rays.
     The results of the investigation also suggest explanations for
many other facts which have hitherto been unexplained.                   Thus
Pasteur and Miquel pointed out some time ago that the germs
floating about in the air are for the most part dead ! This we can
explain by the bactericidal action of the sun's rays, just as we can
also probably explain the freedom from germs of the Alps.
     Again, Martinaud has shown that certain yeasts which normally
vegetate on the exterior of ripening grapes, are destroyed if the
sunshine is very intense ; and Giunti has stated that the ingress of
sunlight hinders acetic fermentation, a process which depends on
the life-processes of a well-known bacterium.
     I have myself observed many cases where the free access to
light is inimical to the germination and development of fungi of
various kinds, and Elfving has recently studied very thoroughly
the action of light on a common mould-fungus with astonishing
results, quite intelligible in the light of the foregoing investigation.
These matters are of more significance in connection with the spread
of the potato and other diseases in dull warm weather than have        I
time to explain here ; and probably have a wide bearing on the
deterioration of forest and agricultural soils exposed to the sun, as
well as on many questions of greenhouse practice too numerous to
even mention.
     They also bear on the question of sun-baths, and the whole
hygiene of sunshine treatment ; as well as sun-burn,
                                                                  " tanning,"
snow-blindness, &c.         But still more startling probabilities must be
looked at, though       I  have brought my lecture now to a point where       I
must remember that your patience in listening to me should not be
abused.
     We have seen that in my experiments certain colour-screens are
efficacious in so cutting off the access of the destructive rays, that the
protected germs, bacilli, fungus-spores, &c., can germinate and develop
as easily as if no light at all was playing on them.            It struck me
during the progress       of these experiments that just  such colour-screens
are very common in Nature, in cases where just such spores and tender

1894.]        on the Action  of Light  on Bacteria  and Fungi.          279
growing cells are compelled to begin or carry on their vegetative pro
cesses in the light.      This led me a short time ago to publish the
following opinions based on the facts even then to hand : — It seems
likely that pollen-grains,     many fungus-spores and a large number
of such organisms   as are exposed to light, are provided with the colour
screens they possess, and which screens are usually red or orange, or
some shade such as cuts out the blue-violet rays, as an adaptive protection
against the injurious rays of light. It is but an extension of this to
see in the green chlorophyll-screen      of all our ordinary plants in part
a protection against the blue-violet rays of ordinary sunlight, the
ingress of which to the cell-contents would bring about destructive
changes of the order discussed in this lecture ; but we must not forget
that the chlorophyll-apparatus is more complex than this, and is
essential to the process of carbon assimilation, absorbing and making
use of the energy derived from the red-orange rays.
     In conclusion, it is impossible to put forward in a single lecture
all the results obtained, and still less the bearings of these results
and the experiments now being continued.            I can merely say that
 there is evidence to show that the slow and continued action of even
comparatively low intensities of light so act on these bacteria            I
am working with that even where they are not killed, but only par
tially injured by the inimical rays, their behaviour is so altered that
the resulting growths are perceptibly different from those of the same
organisms not exposed to light, that their powers of fermenting
organic substances are interfered with, and that various profound
morphological and physiological changes are induced in them. The
bearings of these matters — which are very complex, and the investiga
tion of which is full of peculiar difficulties moreover, are so important in
regard to various questions concerning fermentation, the germ-theory
of disease and other departments of bacteriology, that            I have no
hesitation in saying that no subject more vital to the interests of
mankind exists in the whole domain of biological science.

                   WEEKLY EVENING               MEETING,
                           Friday, May     11, 1894.
           Sir  James Ckiohton-Browne, M.D. LL.D. F.R.S.
               Treasurer and Vice-President, in the Chair.
                     The Rev. S. Baring-Gould,        M.A.
                             English Folk Song.
It  has been a received     commonplace that we English have no folk
music of    our   own.   Nothing can be more erroneous. We have had
our folk song    and  music  as truly as the Scots, the Irish, the Welsh and
the Germans.       Unhappily,     though there have been many collectors
of English ballads and of old English music, such collectors have
not gone to the people themselves, but to the shelves of the British
Museum, or have entrusted second-hand booksellers to gather for
them at sales such sheets of broadside or engraved and printed music
as came into the market.         It is one thing to go into the reading-
room of the British Museum, and in a few days to pick out a
sufficient number of ballads to form a book of English ballads, or of
airs engraved in old music books, to form a volume of English song ;
it is quite another thing altogether to hunt up old singers, few and
far between, only to be heard of after diligent search, and, when found,
to win their confidence, overcome their reserve, and get them to
disclose the treasures buried in the inmost recesses of their memories.
Not only is this difficult, and a matter of much time and tact, but it
is also expensive work, requiring long journeys and lodging at inns,
entertainment of the singers, and also much patience under disap
pointment.      Yet this is positively the only way in which the folk
song of the English peasantry can be got at. The songs published
in collections purporting to represent the folk airs of England are
precisely those they do not sing.        The songs of our peasantry have
been, till quite recently, as little printed as have been those of the
lark, the blackbird and the thrush.
     Folk airs go through strange mutations.               An old English
melody has crossed into Ireland and comes back as " The Wearing
of the Green " ; " Paul's Steeple has passed the border, and also
                                        "
St. George's Channel, and has become in one place " John Anderson,
                                " The Cruiskeen Lawn " " The Pride of
my Jo," and in the other                                    ;
          " has become extremely solemn as " The
Kildare                                                 Story of the Cross,"
sung in Holy Week ; and there is a hymn in Ancient and Modern
I  never like to hear, as tho molody is that of the schoolboy song.

1894.]                      English Folk Song.                         287
" When     I  was a small boy, just fifteen, then very little Greek       I
knew."      The song writers of the end of last century and the
beginning of this took many of our folk airs, altered them slightly,
and adapted to them humorous songs of their own composition.
Such were Clifton, Beuler, Hudson, Sam Gowell, Ac.               Good old
English airs were vulgarised to such words as " Villikins and his
Dinah," and " Billy Barlow," and " Ben was a Hackney-coachman
rare."
     It is in vain to look through the printed music that issued from
the press from the time of Tom Durfey to find the melodies most
dear to the hearts of the old singers in country places. Some of
their airs are older than any that have been published.         One man   I
know sings nothing that is not in an old church mode — a hypo-
Dorian or mixolydian melody suits him down to the ground. He
cannot abide a tune of the modern sort.          But it is not so with all.
They have had to accommodate themselves to the altered taste of the
times, and they sing songs of all dates.
                                                       I
     In my Introduction to " Songs of the West " expressed a doubt
whether the melodies were not heirlooms from a cultured past.
I   doubted their being genuine productions           of the folk muse.
Mr. Sheppard differed from me, and further consideration and
 research induce me to modify my opinion.
     It is the impossibility of tracing these airs, either in the printed
or the engraved songs of the past, that makes me think that a good
many of them may have originated among the people themselves.
 Their melodies are of all ages and styles. There are those that
savour of the Elizabethan madrigal, there are others distinctly earlier,
old minstrel-ballad melodies. There are tunes that bear the impress
of the age of Purccll and Arne and Green, and others that are
Dibdinian. Yet none of these can be found among compositions of
these masters.
     The words are those of the peasant poet.         We can find them in
the halfpenny broadside, often grossly mutilated, for the broadside
ballad is the echo, not the original. It is therefore likely that the
airs as well sprang spontaneously from the joyous or sad hearts of
the people.     Their sorrows and their mirth found natural expression
in song. They were like the birds of the air, they sang because it
was a necessity to sing.
     But then they sang according to the style of singers in vogue, as
they talked and dressed in the prevailing fashion, perhaps always a
little after a fashion had passed. Now and then they accepted songs
that had been composed for them, not often, but occasionally, and
sometimes songs that never had been intended for them, but which
hit their fancy. When such came to them and were accepted, they
generally modified them after their own taste.
     There is one feature in our English peasant song which makes it
essentially worth preservation,     This is its entire genuineness. The
French chanton populaire, according to M. Loquin, is entirely

   288           Bet. S. Baring-Gould       on English Folk Song.      [May  U.
  derived   from the opera music of the last century.              The German
  Volks-Lieder-Schatz is made up to a vast extent of compositions by
  cultured musicians of the end of last century and the beginning of the
  nineteenth, as Kreuzer, Nageli, fieichardt, Silcher, Weber, Ac, and
  only a small percentage are really spontaneous productions of the
  people themselves.       I do not assert that the peasant song in England
  is utterly uncultured music ;       I  believe that there has always been,
  and in almost every village, an element of musical culture, fostered
  by the parish orchestra in the west gallery of the church ; and that
  most —nearly all — of our folk airs have been composed by men of no
  musical note beyond their own parishes, but not without musical
 knowledge —men with hearts full of melody and heads with a
 knowledge of musical rule, and themselves belonging to the peasant
 class.
      There is something even in music to be learned from our healthy
 English peasantry. None of the mawkishness of the French muse,
 but a robustness, a freshness, a joyousness, sometimes a pathos, in
 character with the people from whom these airs sprang.
      If  a musician desires to enjoy an unusual holiday, and reap a
 good    and  delightful harvest, let him take my advice. Let him put
 on an old coat and hat and go on a tramp through England, lodging
 at little taverns, and associate with the labourers in fields and over
 the tavern table, and about the tavern fire.
      There is no time to be lost. Every winter with its storms sweeps
 away some of our old singers.              The young know nothing; the
 middle-aged nothing.         I sat over  a peat fire with a Scottish shepherd
 one night and asked him to sing to me, and he gave me nothing but
 music-hall balderdash.         But then he was a young man. Many of
 the oldest singers can no longer be heard in the public-houses, they
 must be sought out in their humble homes.
    A good many of the folk songs being in Gregorian modes, or
 having startling intervals, and being irregular in construction,
 puzzle the ear.      It is some time before we become accustomed to the
 new style — or rather to the old style, so new to us accustomed to the
 dilute treacle of the modern song.          But it is worth while becoming
acquainted with it.
    Finally, even suppose that this rustic muse of ours have not all
the charms     I  claim for her, suppose that she be a little lacking in
the languor of the drawing-room and the affectation of the stage,
yet surely the Englishman should regard her with respect, with

             The Splash   of a Drop and Allied Phenomena.
The splash of a drop is a transaction which is accomplished in the
twinkling of an eye, and it may seem to some that a man who pro
poses to discourse on the matter for an hour must have lost all seuse
of proportion.                             I
                  If that opinion exists, hope this evening to be able
to remove it and to convince you that we have to deal with an
exquisitely regulated phenomenon, and one which very happily
illustrates some of the fundamental properties of fluids. It may be
mentioned also that the recent researches of Lenard in Germany and
J. J. Thomson at Cambridge, on the curious development of electrical
charges that accompanies certain kinds of splashes, have invested
with a new interest any examination of the mechanics of the
phenomenon.      It is to the mechanical and not to the electrical side
                       I
of the question that shall call your attention this evening.
     The first well directed and deliberate observations on the subject
that  I am aquainted with were made by a schoolboy at Rugby some
twenty years ago, and were reported by him to the Rugby Natural
History Society. Ho had observed that the marks of accidental splashes
of ink-drops that had fallen on some smoked glasses with which he
was experimenting, presented an appearance not easy to account for.
Drops of the same size falling from the same height had made always
the same kind of mark, which when carefully examined with a lens
showed that the smoke had been swept away in a system of minute
concentric rings and fine strife. Specimens of such patterns, obtained
by letting drops of mercury, alcohol and water fall on to smoked
glass, are thrown on the screen, and the main characteristics are easily
recognised.    Such a pattern corresponds to the footprints of the dance
that has been performed on the surface, and though the drop may be
lying unbroken on the plate, it has evidently been taking violent
exercise, and were our vision acute enough we might observe that it
was still palpitating after its exertions.
     A careful examination of a large number of such footprints showed
that any opinion that could be formed therefrom of the nature of
the motion of the drop must be largely conjectural, and it occurred
to me about eighteen years ago to endeavour by means of the illumi-

nation of a suitably timed electric spark to watch a drop through its
various changes on impact.
     The reason that with ordinary continuous light nothing can be
satisfactorily seen of the splash, is not that the phenomenon is of
such short duration, but because the changes are so rapid that before
the image of one stage has faded from the eye the image of a later
and quite different stage is superposed upon it. Thus the resulting
impression is a confused assemblage of all the stages, as in the photo
graph of a person who has not sat still while the camera was looking
at him.      The problem to be solved experimentally was therefore
this : to let a drop of definite size fall from a definite height in
comparative darkness on to a surface, and to illuminate it by a flash
of exceedingly short duration at any desired stage, so as to exclude
all the stages previous and subsequent to the one thus picked out.
The flash must be bright enough for the image of what is seen to
remain long enough on the eye for the observer to be able to attend
to    it,
        even to shift his attention from one part to another, and thus
to make         drawing of what
                a                          is
                                          seen.           If
                                                     necessary the experiment
must be capable of repetition, with an exactly similar drop falling
from exactly the same height, and illuminated at exactly the same
stage.     Then, when this stage has been sufficiently studied, we must
be able to arrange with another similar drop to illuminate                 at it      a
rather later stage, say xtiW second later, and in this way to follow
step by step the course of the whole phenomenon.
     The apparatus by which this has been accomplished                   on the
                                                                         is

of earlier arrangements very different in appearance, but its action                  is
very simple and easy to follow by reference to the diagram (Fig. 1).
      A A'      is light wooden rod rather longer and thicker than an
                     a
ordinary lead pencil, and pivoted on a horizontal axle O. The rod
bears at the end            small deep watch-glass, or segment of
                              A
                              a                                          watch-

will lie on       without adhesion. The end A' carries a small strip of
                 it
tinned iron, which can be pressed against and held down by an
electromagnet          C. When the current of the electromagnet
                          C                                                 cut  is
off the iron       released, and the end A' of the rod
                     is                                        tossed up by the
                                                                   is

left in mid-air free to fall from rest.
      B B'  is   aprecisely similar rod worked in just the same way, but
carrying    at       Bsmall horizontal metal ring, on which an ivory timing
                          a
sphere   of  the  size   of    child's marble can be supported. On cutting

off the current      of   the  electromagnet the ends A' and B' of the two
 levers  are   simultaneously tossed up by the catapults, and thus drop
 and sphere begin to fall at the same moment. Before, however, the
 drop reaches the surface on which               to impinge, the timing sphere

of the splash, and it is by this flash that the splash is viewed. The
illumination is greatly helped by surrounding the place where the
splash and flash are produced by a white cardboard enclosure, seen
in Fig. 2, from whose walls the light is diffused.
     It will be observed that the time at which the spark is made will
depend on the distance that the sphere has to fall before striking the

 observer, sitting in comparative but by no means complete darkness,
 faces the apparatus as it appears in Fig. 2, presses down the ends
 A' B' of the levers first described, so that they are held by the electro
 magnet C (Fig. 1). Then he presses the lever NP down on the
 electromagnet F, sets the timing sphere and drop in place, and then

  thus cuts off the current of the electromagnet C.         This lets off drop
  and sphere, and produces the flash.       The stage of the phenomenon
 that is thus revealed having been sufficiently studied by repetition
 of the experiment as often as may be necessary, he lowers the plate
 D a fraction of an inch and thus obtains a later stage.          Not only is
 any   desired  stage   of the phenomenon    thus easily   brought  under ex
 amination, but the apparatus also affords the means of measuring the
 time interval between any two stages.         All that is necessary is to
 know the distance that the timing sphere falls in the two cases.
 Elementary dynamics then give us the interval required.              Thus, if
 the sphere falls one foot and we then lower D           \  inch, the interval
 between the corresponding stages will be about • 0026 second.
                                                     I
      Having thus described the apparatus, which hope shortly to show
 you in action, I pass to the information that has been obtained by it.
      This is contained in a long series of drawings, of which a selec
 tion will be presented on the screen.        The First Series that haveI
 to show represents the splash of a drop of mercury 0*15 inch in dia
 meter that has fallen 3 inches on to a smooth glass plate.         It will be
 noticed that very soon after the first moment of impact, minute rays
 are shot out in all directions on the surface.       These are afterwards
 overflowed or united, until, as in Fig. 8, the outline is only slightly
 rippled.    Then (Fig. 9) main rays shoot out, from the ends of which
 in some cases minute droplets of liquid would split off, to be left
 lying in a circle on the plate, and visible in all subsequent stages.
 By counting these droplets when they were thus left, the number of
 rays was ascertained to have been generally about 24. This exquisite
 shell-like configuration shown in Fig. 9, marks about the maximum
 spread of the liquid, which, subsiding in the middle, afterwards flows
 into an annulus or rim with a very thin central film, so thin, in fact,
 as often to tear more or less irregularly.        This annular rim then
 divides or segments (Figs. 14, 15, 16) in such a manner as to join
 up the rays in pairs, and thus passes into the 12-lobed annulus of
Fig. 16. Then the whole contracts, but contracts most rapidly be
 tween the lobes, the liquid then being driven into and feeding the
arms, which follow more slowly.         In Fig. 21 the end of this stage is
reached, and now the arms continuing to come in, the liquid rises in
the centre ; this is, in fact, the beginning of the rebound of the drop
from the plate.       In the case before us the drops at the ends of the
arms now break off (Fig. 25), while the central mass rises in a
column which just fails itself to break up into drops, and falls back
into the middle of the circle of satellites which, it will be understood,
may in some cases again be surrounded by a second circle of the
still smaller and more numerous droplets that split off the ends of
the rays in Fig. 9. The whole of the 30 stages described are accom
plished in about ^ second, so that the average interval between
them is about -^^ second.
     It should be mentioned that it is only in rare cases that the sub
ordinate drops, seen in the last six figures, are found lying in a very

294                  Professor   A. M. Worthington             [May   18,
complete circle after all is over, for there is generally some slight
disturbing lateral velocity which causes many to mingle again with
the central drop, or with each other.       But even if only half or a
quarter of the circle is left, it is easy to estimate how many drops,
and therefore how many arms there have been.       It may be mentioned
that sometimes the surface of the central lake of liquid, Figs. 14, 15,
16, 17, was seen to be covered with beautiful concentric ripples, not
shown in the figures.
     The question now naturally presents itself, why should the drop
behave in this manner ?      In seeking the answer it will be useful to
ask ourselves another question.      What should we have expected the
drop to do ? Well, to this   I   suppose most people would be inclined,
arguing from analogy with a solid, to reply that it would be reason
able to expect the drop to flatten itself, and even very considerably
flatten itself, and then, collecting itself together again, to rebound,
perhaps as a column such as we have seen, but not to form this
regular system of rays and arms and subordinate drops.
     Now this argument from analogy with a solid is rather mislead
ing, for the forces that operate in the case of a solid sphere that
flattens itself and rebounds, are due to the bodily elasticity which
enables it not only to resist, but also to recover from any distortion
of shape or shearing of its internal parts past each other. But a
liquid has no power of recovering from such internal shear, and the
only force that checks the spread, and ultimately causes the recovery
of shape is the surface tension, which arises from the fact that the
surface layers are always in a state of extension and always en
deavouring to contract.        Thus we are at liberty when dealing
with the motions of the drop to think of the interior liquid as
not coherent, provided we furnish it with a suitable elastic skin.
Where the surface skin is sharply curved outwards, as it is at
the sharp edge of the flattened disc, there the interior liquid will
be strongly pressed back.         In fact the process of flattening and
recoil is one in which energy of motion is first expended in creating
fresh liquid surface, and subsequently recovered as the surface con
tracts.   The transformation is, however, at all moments accompanied
by a great loss of energy as heat. Moreover, it must be remembered
 that the energy expended in creating the surface of the satellite drops
 is not restored if these remain permanently separate. Thus the sur
face tension explains the recoil, and it is also closely connected with
 the formation of the subordinate rays and arms. To explain this it
 is only necessary to remind you that a liquid cylinder is an unstable
configuration.    As you know, any fine jet becomes beaded and breaks
into drops, but it is not necessary that there should be any flow of
liquid along the jet ; if,  for example, we could realisea  rod of liquid
of the shape and size of this ruler and liberate it  in the air,
                                                               it  would
not retain its cylindrical shape, but would segment or divide itself
up into  a   row of drops regularly disposed according to a definite
and very simple numerical law, viz. that the distances between the

1894.]        on the Splash   of a Drop and Allied      Phenomena.            295
centres of contiguous drops would be equal to the circumference of the
cylinder. This can be shown by calculation to be a consequence of
the surface tension, and the calculation has been closely verified by
experiment.       If the liquid cylinder were liberated on a plate, it
would still topple into a regular row of drops, but they would be
further apart ; this was shown by Plateau. Now imagine the cylinder
bent into an annulus.       It will still follow the same law,* i. e. it will
topple   into drops just   as                                    I
                              if it were straight. This can show you
by a   direct  experiment.    I  have here a small thick disc of iron, with
an accurately planed face and a handle at the back.                In the face is
cut a circular groove, whose cross section is a semicircle.             I now lay
this disc face downwards on the horizontal face of the lantern con
denser, and through one of two small holes bored through to the
back of the disc     I fill the groove with quicksilver. Now, suddenly
lifting the disc from the plate      I  release an annulus of liquid, which
splits into the circle of very equal drops which you see projected on
the screen. You will notice that the main drops have between them
still smaller ones, which have come from the splitting up of the thin
cylindrical necks of liquid which connected the larger drops at the
last moment.
     Now this tendency to segment or topple into drops, whether of a
straight cylinder or of an annulus, is the key to the formation of the
arms and satellites, and indeed to much that happens in all the
splashes that we shall examine. Thus in Fig. 12 we have an annular
rim, which in Figs. 13 and 14 is seen to topple into lobes by which
 the rays are united in pairs, and even the special rays that are seen
in Fig. 9 owe their origin to the segmentation of the rim of the thin
disc into which the liquid has spread.            The proceeding is probably
exactly analogous to what takes place in a sea wave that curls over
in calm weather on a slightly sloping shore. Any one may notice
how, as it curls over, the wave presents a long smooth edge, from
which at a given instant a multitude of jets suddenly shoot out, and
at once the back of the wave, hitherto smooth, is seen to be furrowed
or " combed." There can be no doubt that the cylindrical edge
topples into alternate convexities and concavities ; at the former the
flow is helped, at the latter hindered, and thus the jets begin, and
special lines of How are determined.            In precisely the same way the
previously smooth circular edge of Fig. 8 topples, and determines
the rays and lines of flow of Fig. 9.

     Before going on to other splashes will now endeavour to reproduce
a mercury splash of the kind       I  have described, in a manner that shall
be visible to all. For this purpose        I  have reduplicated the apparatus
which you have seen, and have it here so arranged that              I can let the
drop fall on to the horizontal condenser plate of the lantern, through
which the light passes upwards, to be afterwards thrown upon this

screen.      The illuminating flash will be made inside the lantern,
where the arc light would ordinarily be placed.             I have now set a
drop of mercury in readiness and put the timing sphere in place, and
now if you will look intently at the middle of the screen                I  will
darken the room and let off the splash. (The experiment was repeated
four or five times, and the figures seen were like those of Series X.)
Of course all that can be shown in this way is the outline, or rather
a horizontal section of the splash ; but you are able to recognise
some of the configurations already described, and will be the more
willing to believe that a momentary view is after all sufficient to give
much information if one is on the alert and has acquired skill by
practice.
      The general features of the splash that we have examined are not
merely characteristic of the liquid mercury, but belong to all splashes
of a liquid falling on to a surface which it does not wet, provided the
height of fall or size of the drop are not so great as to cause complete
disruption,* in which case there is no recovery and rebound.               Thus
a drop of milk falling on to smoked glass will, if the height of fall
and size of drop are properly adjusted, give forms very similar to
those presented by a drop of mercury.             The whole course of the
phenomenon depends,       in fact, mainly  on four  quantities only : ( 1 ) the
size of the drop ; (2) the height of fall ; (3) the value of the surface
 tension ; (4) the viscosity of the liquid.
      The next series of drawings illustrates the splash of a drop of
water falling into water.
      In order the better to distinguish the liquid of the original drop
from that into which it falls, the latter was coloured with ink or
with an aniline dye, and the drop itself was of water rendered turbid
with finely-divided matter in suspension.            Finally drops of milk
were found to be very suitable for the purpose, the substitution of
milk for water not producing any observable change in the phe
nomenon.
      In Series II. the drop fell 3 inches, and was inch in diameter.

      It will be observed that the drop flattens itself out somewhat, and
descends at the bottom of a hollow with a raised beaded edge
(Fig. 2).      This edge would be smooth and circular but for the
instability which causes it to topple into drops. As the drop descends
the hollow becomes wider and deeper, and finally closes over the

drop (Fig. 3), which, however, soon again emerges as the hollow
flattens out, appearing first near, but still below the surface (Fig. 4),
in a flattened, lobed form, afterwards rising as a column somewhat
mixed with adherent water, in which traces of the lobes are at first
very visible.
     The rising column, which is nearly cylindrical, breaks up into
drops before or during its subsequent descent into the liquid.        As it
disappears below the surface the outward and downward flow causes
a hollow to be again formed, up the sides of which an annulus of
milk is carried, while the remainder descends to be torn again a
second time into a vortex ring, which, however, is liable to disturb
ance from the falling in of the drops which once formed the upper
part of the rebounding column.
     It is not difficult to recognise some features of this splash without
any apparatus beyond a cup of tea and a spoonful of milk. Any
drinker of afternoon tea, after the tea is poured out and before the
milk is put in, may let the milk fall into it drop by drop from one or
two inches above it. The rebounding column will be seen to consist
almost entirely of milk, and to break up into drops in the manner
described, while the vortex ring, whose core is of milk, may be seen
to shoot down into the liquid. But this is better observed by dropping
ink into a tumbler of clear water.
     Let us now increase the height of fall to 17 inches. Series        III.
exhibits the result.      All the characteristics of the last splash are
more strongly marked.         In Fig. 1 we have caught sight of the little
raised rim of the hollow before it has beaded, but in Fig. 2 special
channels of easiest flow have been already determined.        The number
of ribs and rays in this basket-shaped hollow seemed to vary a good
deal with different drops, as also did the number of arms and lobes
seen in later figures, in a somewhat puzzling manner, and           I  have
made no attempt to select drawings which are in agreement in this
respect.     It will be understood that these rays contain little or none
of the liquid of the drop, which remains collected together in the
middle.     Drops from these rays or from the larger arms and lobes of
subsequent figures are often thrown off high into the air.       In Figs. 3
and 4 the drop is clean gone below the surface of the hollow, which
is now deeper and larger than before. The beautiful beaded annular
edge then subsides, and in Fig. 5 we see the drop again, and in Fig. 6
it begins to emerge. But although the drop has fallen from a greater
height than in the previous splash, the energy of the impact, instead
of being expended in raising the same amount of liquid to a greater
height, is now spent in lifting a much thicker adherent column to
about the same height as in the last splash.        There was sometimes
noticed, as is seen in Fig. 9, a tendency in the water to flow up past
the milk, which, still comparatively unmixed with water, rides trium
phant on the top of the emergent column.             The greater relative
thickness of this column prevents it splitting into drops, and Figs. 10
and 11 show it descending below the surface to form the hollow of
                                                      /

Fig.  12, up the sides of which an annular film of milk is carried
(Figs. 12 and 13), having been detached from the central mass, which
descends to be torn again, this time centrally into a well-marked
vortex ring.
      Ifwe keep to the same size of drop and increase the fall to some
thing over a yard, no great change occurs in the nature of the splash,
but the emergent column is rather higher and thinner and shows a
tendency to split into drops.
     When, however, we double the volume of the drop and raise the
height of fall to 52 inches, the splash of Series IV. is obtained, which
is beginning to assume quite a different character. The raised rim
of the previous series is now developed into a hollow shell of consider
able height, which tends to close over the drop.     This shell or dome
is a characteristic feature of all splashes made by large drops falling
from a considerable height, and is extremely beautiful.           In the
splash at present under consideration it does not always succeed in
closing permanently, but opens out as it subsides, and is followed by
the emergence of the drop (Fig. 8). In Fig. 9 the return wave over
whelms the drop for an instant, but it is again seen at the summit of
the column in Fig. 10.
     But on other occasions the shell or dome of Figs. 4 and 5 closes
permanently over the imprisoned air, the liquid then flowing down
the sides, which become thinner and thinner, till at length we are left
with a large bubble floating on the water (see Series V.). It will
be observed that the flow of liquid down the sides is chiefly along
definite channels, which are probably determined by the arms thrown
up at an earlier stage. The bubble is generally creased by the weight
of the liquid along these channels. It must be remembered that the
base of the bubble is in a state of oscillation, and that the whole is
liable to burst at any moment, when such figures as 6 and 7 of the
previous series will be seen.
     Such is the history of the building of the bubbles which big rain
drops leave on the smooth water of a lake, or pond, or puddle.       It is
only the bigger drops that can do     it,and reference to the number at
the side of Fig. of Series IV. shows that the dome
                5                                      is raised in about
two-hundredth  s   of second. Should the domes fail to close, or should
                    a
they open again, we have the emergent columns which any attentive
observer will readily recognise, and which have never been better
described than by Mr. R. L. Stevenson, who, in his delightful
'
  Inland Voyage,' speaks of the surface of the Belgian canals along
which he was canoeing, as thrown up by the rain into " an infinity of
little crystal fountains."
     Very beautiful forms of the same type indeed, but different in
detail, are those produced by   a drop of water falling into the lighter
and more mobile liquid, petroleum.
     It will now be interesting to turn to the splash that produced

    The Size of Drop and Height of Fall are the same as before, but the hollow shell
(see figs. 4 and 5 of the previous Series) does not succeed in opening, but is left as a
bubble on the surface.    This explains the formation of bubbles when big raindrops fall
into a pool of water.

any rate up to    a height of fall of 4 or 5 feet, depends entirely on the
state   of the surface of the sphere. A polished sphere of marble about
0-6 of an inch in diameter, rubbed very dry with a cloth just before
hand and dropped from a hsight of 2 feet into water, gave the figures
of Series VI., in which it is seen that the water spreads over the
sphere so rapidly, that it is sheathed with the liquid even before it
has passed below the general level of the surface.                  The splash is
insignificantly small and of very short duration. If the drying and
polishing be not so perfect, the configurations of Series VII. are pro
duced ; while if the sphere be roughened with sand-paper, or left wet,
Series VIII. is obtained, in which it will be perceived that, as was the
case with a liquid drop, the water is driven away laterally, forming
the ribbed basket-shaped hollow, which, however, is now prolonged to
a great depth, the drop being followed by a cone of air, while the
water seems to find great difficulty in wetting the surface completely.
Fart of this column of air was carried down at least 16 inches, and
then only detached when the sphere struck the bottom of the vessel.
     Figs. 6 and 7 show the crater falling in, but this did not always
happen, for the walls often closed over the hollow exactly as in
Figs. 4 and 5 of Series IV. Meanwhile the long and nearly cylin
drical portion below breaks up into bubbles which rise quickly to
the surface.
     By increasing the fall to 5 feet we obtain the figures of Series IX.
The tube of Fig. 1 corresponds to the dome of Series IV. and V., and
is not only elevated to a surprising height, but is also in the act of
cleaving (the outline being approximately that of the unduloid of
M. Plateau).      Figs. 2 and 3 show the bubble formed by the closing
up   of  this tube, weighed down in the centre as in Figs. 5 and 6 of
Series V. Similar results were obtained with other liquids, such as
petroleum and alcohol.
     It is easy to show in a very striking manner the paramount influ
 ence of the condition of the solid surface.         I have here a number of
similar marbles;      this   set  has  been  well  polished by rubbing with
wash leather.       I drop them one by one through a space of about
 1 foot into this deep, wide, cylindrical glass vessel, lighted up by a
lamp placed behind it. You see each marble enters noiselessly and
with hardly a visible trace of splash. Now               I  pick them out and
drop    them   in again   Tor   to  save trouble,  I  drop    in these other wet
ones), everything      is   changed.     You   see  how    the   air is carried to
                                                             "              " of the
the very bottom of the vessel, and you hear the                >£A.oio-/3os
bubbles as they rise to the surface and burst.            These dry but rough
marbles behave in much the same way.
     Such are the main features of the Natural History of Splashes, as
I  made it out between thirteen and eighteen years ago. Before passing
                                  I
on to the photographs that have since obtained,             I  desire to add a few
words of comment.         I  have not till now alluded to any imperfections
in the timing apparatus. But no apparatus of tho kind can be ab
solutely perfect, and as a matter of fact, when everything is adjusted

300                         Professor   A. M. Worthington               [May 18,
so   as to display a particular stage, it will happen that in a suc
cession of observations there is a certain variation in what is seen.
Thus the configuration viewed may be said to oscillate slightly
about the mean for which the apparatus is adjusted.                 Now this is
due both to small imperfections in the timing apparatus and to
the fact that the splashes themselves do actually vary within
certain limits. The reasons are not very far to seek.               In the first
place    the  rate   of   demagnetisation       of   the  electromagnets    varies
slightly, being partly dependent on the varying resistance of the con
tacts of crossed wires, partly on the temperature of the magnet,
which is affected by the length of time for which the current has
been running.       But a much more important reason is the variation of
the slight adhesion of the drop to the smoked watch-glass that has
supported   it, and consequently of the oscillations to which, as we shall
see, the drop      subjected as
                  is              it  descends. Thus the drop will sometimes
strike the surface in flattened form, at others in an elongated form,
                            a
and there will be       adifference, not only in the time of impact, but in
the nature of the ensuing splash            ; consequently some judgment       is
required in selecting       a consecutive series of drawings.      The only way
is  to make a   considerable number of drawings of each stage, and then
to pick out      consecutive series. Now, whenever judgment has to be
used, there  is aroom for error of judgment, and moreover,         it   isimpos
 sible to put together the drawings so as to tell           a  consecutive story,
without being guided by some theory, such as have already sketched,

as to the nature of the motion and the conditions that govern it.
You will therefore be good enough to remember that this chronicle of
the events of       tenth of
                    a            a second   is  presented by a fallible human
historian, whose account, like that of any other contemporary ob
server, will be none the worse for independent confirmation.                 That
 confirmationI     am fortunately able in some measure to supply. When
I  endeavoured eighteen years ago to photograph the splash of drop of   a
 mercury,I     was unable to obtain plates sufficiently sensitive to re
 spond to the very short exposures that were required, and conse
 quently abandoned the attempt.                But in recent years plates of
 exquisite sensitiveness have been produced, and such photographs as
 those taken by Mr. Boys of             a flying rifle bullet, have shown that
 difficulties on the score     of  sensitiveness    have been practically over
 come.      Within   the  last  few    weeks,  with   the valuable assistance of
 my colleague     at   Devonport,      Mr.   K.  8.  Cole,
                                                      I       have succeeded in
 obtaining photographs         of various    splashes.    Following Prof. Boys'
 suggestion,   we  employed      Thomas's     cyclist plates, or occasionally the
                                    "
 less sensitive " extra-rapid          plates of the same makers, and as        a
 developer,   Eikonogen      solution   of triple strength, in which the plates
 were kept for about 40 minutes, the development being conducted in
 complete darkness.
      A few preliminary trials with the self-induction spark produced
 at the surface of mercury by the apparatus that you have seen at work,
 showed that the illumination, though ample for direct vision, was not

sufficient for photography.         When the current strength was increased,
so as to make the illumination bright enough for the camera, then
the spark became of too great duration, for it lasted for between
4 and 5 thousandths of a second, within which time there was very
perceptible motion of the drop and consequent blurring.                     It was
therefore necessary to modify the apparatus so as to employ a
Lieyden-jar spark whose duration was probably less than 10-millionths
of a second. A very slight change in the apparatus rendered it
suitable for the new conditions, but time does not permit me to
describe the arrangements in detail.              It is, however, less necessary
to do so as the method is in all essentials the same as that described
in this room two years ago by Lord Rayleigh in connection with the
photography of a breaking soap-film.*               I  therefore pass at once to
the photographs themselves.
      The first two series (X. and XI.) may be described           as shadow pho
tographs ; they were obtained by allowing a drop of mercury to fall
on to the naked photographic plate itself, the illuminating spark being
produced vertically above it, and they give only a horizontal section of
the drop in various stages.         The first series corresponds to a mercury
splash very similar to that first described, and the second to the
splash of a larger drop such as was not described. In each series,
the tearing of the thin central film to which allusion was made is
well illustrated.       I think the first comment that any one would make
is that the photographs, while they bear out the drawings in many
 details, show greater irregularity than the drawings would have led
 one to expect.         On this point       I   shall presently have something
 to say.
      Comparing the first       set of drawings with the photographs              of
 Series    X. it will  be seen that
                 Photograph    2 corresponds to     drawing 4 or    5,

  interior. The polished surface of the mercury is, in fact, very trouble
  some to illuminate, and this splash proved the most difficult of all
  to photograph.

  smoked glass plate, on which it runs about without adhesion just as

persons pronounce what they have seen to be a regular and sym
metrical star-shaped figure, and they are surprised when they come
to examine it by detail in continuous light to find how far this is
from the truth.      Especially is this the case if no irregularity is
suspected  beforehand.     I believe that the observer, usually finding
himself unable to attend to more than a portion of the rays in the
system, is liable instinctively to pick out for attention a part of the
circumference where they are regularly spaced, and to fill up the rest
in imagination, and that where a ray may be really absent ho prefers
to consider that it has been imperfectly viewed.

     This opinion is confirmed by the fact that in several cases have
been able to observe with the naked eye a splash that was also
simultaneously     photographed, and have made the memorandum
" quite regular," though the photograph subsequently showed irregu
larity. It must, however, be observed that the absolute darkness and
other conditions necessary for photography are not very favourable
for direct vision.
     And now my tale is told, or rather as much of it as the limits of
the time allowed me will permit.      I  think you will agree that the
phenomena are very beautiful, and that the details of this transac

began, have yet proved worthy of an hour's attention.

             The Development    of the Astronomical Telescope.
        I
Since last had the honour of lecturing in this theatre, astronomical
research has had opened up to it a totally new field of work, one
which appears almost without limit in its scope.
     When Dr. Gill, of the Cape of Good Hope Observatory, made
arrangements to photograph the comet of 1882 with a long exposure,
using only an ordinary photographic lens, even his fertile and
sanguine spirit did not,    I  think, anticipate the possibilities opened
to astronomical research since photography has been called in to
its aid.
     I do not propose in this lecture to discuss any of the interesting
astronomical and physical problems that have been opened up by
the adoption of the " New Astronomy," as it is aptly called.       I leave
these subjects to be dealt with by those who have made such their
special study, and are better qualified to speak of them.
     I propose to-night to discuss the differing conditions which astro
nomical instruments are required to fulfil under the new system as
compared with the old, and to point out the possibilities that appear
to exist for improvement and future development, touching only on
the astronomical part of the work so much as may be necessary to
explain the instrumental equipment required.
                                       I
     It would be well, perhaps, that should first call to your recollec
tion some of the chief lines of work which have been opened by the
introduction of the new photographic method.
     The International Photographic Survey of the Heavens has been
 undertaken by sixteen of the principal observatories of the world,
which have agreed to co-operate in producing two series of photo
 graphic pictures of the entire heavens ; the first series including all
 stars down to the 11th magnitude, a catalogue of which is to be
 formed from the photographic plates; while the other series will
 include all stars to the 14th magnitude, and will be photographically
 reproduced as a chart.
     The enormous advantages of photography for this work, as com
 pared with the old system, have been brought so often and so
 prominently before you by Dr. Gill and other lecturers that it is
 unnecessary for me to dwell upon them here. As a supplement to

 1894.]                on the Astronomical  Telescope.                305
 this international work we have the independent surveys of Dr. Gill
 and Professor Pickering, taken photographically with short focus
 lenses on a small scale.
     We have also the recording by the aid of photography of specially
interesting objects, star clusters and groups, comets, &c., and more
particularly very faint objects such as nebulae, which require long
exposure.     The results in this field of work demonstrate perhaps
more than any other the powerful agent that photography becomes in
the hands of the astronomer.         It is not necessary to go into any
detail in considering this work, the results of which are tolerably
familiar to you. It is only necessary to mention the names of Draper,
Common, Gill, the Brothers Henry, Eoberts, Gothard, Barnard
Russell and Dr. Max Wolf, to indicate how much we owe to long
exposure photography on these objects.
     Of new minor planets, 33 were discovered by photography in
 1893, and several lost planets were rediscovered.
     We have also the study of the parallax of fixed stars and of nebulae
by this means, as carried out by Rutherford and Jacoby in America,
 Professor Pritchard at Oxford, Sir Robert Ball and Professor
Rambaut at Dunsink and Dr. Wilsing at Potsdam.
     Turning to spectroscopy, we find again the enormous importance
of the photographic method.          The development of Fraunhofer's
original idea of a slitless spectroscope has given us the objective
prism of to-day, and with this instrument we are able to simulta
neously photograph the spectra of several hundreds of stars on a
single plate, these spectra being available for study at leisure, so that
they can be classified and selected for future work and more crucial
examination and investigation.       The results from a single plate are
more accurate than could possibly be given by months of very close
observation by the older method. The Draper Catalogue, which we
owo to Professor E. C. Pickering, of Cambridge, Mass., gives the
spectra of over 10,000 northern stars obtained in this manner.         In
addition to this he has in preparation a similar catalogue of the
southern stars. The beautiful photographs obtained by Professor
Lockyer at South Kensington, in which the detail is so fine that the
spectra can be enlarged to a length of five feet, show the great
value of this method for complete study of the spectra after the first
rough cataloguing.       With the slit spectroscope equally important
work has been done in the " New Astronomy." Not only can we get
the spectra of celestial objects with comparison spectra of terrestrial
substances on the same plate, and thus investigate the chemical and
physical constitution of these bodies, but by the adaptation of the
beautiful discovery of Dr. Huggins we can detect and measure the
motion in the line of sight, the photographic method giving far more
accurate results than can be obtained by visual means.      In the hands
of Dr. Vogel, of Potsdam, this spectrographio method htys been used
for nearly fifty stars, and he is only waiting for a larger instrument
to further extend this work.       We have also in this connection the

discovery of spectroscopic double stars, stars so close that we cannot
hope to see them double by any possible optical means, and yet of
which we know sufficient by the aid of photography to calculate their
masses, distances, periods and rates of motion with considerable
accuracy.     In this work Professor Pickering, at Cambridge, Mass.,
and Dr. Vogel, at Potsdam, led the way, but Father Sidgreaves,
 at Stonyhurst, has extended the work by his beautiful analysis of the
 variations in the spectrum of /3 Lyres.
      Lastly may be mentioned the work of Professor Hale at Chicago,
 on the photography of solar prominences and faculae with the
 spectro-hcliograph.      In this apparatus, instead of using the full
 light of the sun, only light of one wave-length is allowed to act on
 the plate.    There are several methods of accomplishing this, but
 the latest form is that of an ordinary spectroscope with a metal
 plate to receive the spectrum, a narrow slit being arranged in
 this plate to select the particular wave-length in which it is
 desired to work.     The photographic plate is behind a second slit
 and in the image formed of the spectrum. The whole spectroscope is
 given a motion such that the front slit passes over the image of the
 sun formed by a photographic object glass, while the selecting slit
 moves at the same rate in front of the photographic plate.            A
 complete picture of the prominences, chromosphere and faculte of
 the sun is thus obtained, and by an ingenious adaptation of clock
 work Professor Hale has been able to make his apparatus automatic,
 and to set it to take 36 plates of the sun at any desired interval of
 time between each, without any superintendence whatever from the
 observer in charge.      Photography has also been extended to the
  study of solar spots, lunar and planetary detail, and many other
  departments of astronomical research too numerous to mention, but
  not having any special interest for us at present in their bearing
  upon the instrumental arrangements.
      Every one of these branches of work has already been not only
  suggested but put into actual practice with more or less success, but,
  as usual in the inception of such work, there are many lessons to be
  learned from the first few years' experience.   The most evident fact,
  and one easily learned from any one of the various brunches
  mentioned, is that the utmost perfection is necessary in the apparatus
  which enables the telescope to follow the object to be photographed.
  Before enumerating the various points necessary to be attended to to
  ensure this accuracy, perhaps it would be well to explain why this
 increased amount of accuracy is necessary when using the photo
  graphic method of observation.     In the older methods it sufficed if
  the star remained on the wires of the micrometer during the actual
  observation, which rarely lasted many seconds, and even if the star
 did move off the wire the observer could see that it did so, and would
  move up his wire again to the star, repeat the observation, and would
 not record it unless he was satisfied that all was right at the moment
 of bi-section.

1894.]                en the Astronomical Telescope.                 307
    In the photographic method, however, the record of the observa
tion is not that of any one moment, it is the aggregate of all the
impressions made every second and every part of a second during the
exposure.      The photographic plate, unlike the eye, takes note of,
and records every position of the star image, and not the one selected
position as the eye does ; hence you can easily see the great necessity
of having the utmost possible perfection in the clock driving
arrangements.
     This condition of perfection is popularly supposed to be satisfied
by having a perfect clock, but there is hardly a portion of the
instrument that can be mentioned, the perfection of which does not
contribute in some way or other to the accuracy of the motion.
     1. The instrument     must have a stability far beyond what is
necessary for ordinary work, otherwise the very handling of the slow
motions will sensibly affect the positions of the images and injure
the results.
    2. It is evident that the axis on which the instrument revolves
must be of extreme accuracy, otherwise the instrument will not move
truly.
    3. The anti-friction arrangements must be of the most efficient
nature in order to give the clock a fair chance of doing its work.
    4. The slow motions must be extremely perfect, as otherwise it
will be impossible to bring the guiding star on the cross wires of the
" guider " with that accuracy necessary for the best results.
    5. The arrangements, even for the adjustment of the instrument,
so far at least as the placing of the polar axis parallel to the pole of
the earth, must be such as to enable the observer to make this adjust
ment with an accuracy not at all necessary for visual observations.
     J'rof'essor Rambaut, Royal Astronomer of Ireland, has recently
shown that whereas for ordinary visual work it suffices if the polar
axis of a telescope be adjusted in altitude and azimuth with an
accuracy of 1 minute of arc, errors of a few seconds of arc only are
allowable with a photographic telescope, and that this great degree of
accuracy is best obtained from measurements of the photographic
plate itself.
    An instrument, therefore, that is required to give the best results
used photographically,    should be made with a view to such work in
all its details from the very beginning, for an instrument that may
be excellent for ordinary observations will most probably break
down under the stringent conditions necessary for the more modern
work.
    In the usual form of mounting it is necessary to reverse the
instrument when observations have been made on a star as it passes
from the east to the west of the meridian.        This is a great disad
 vantage in photographic work, and in designing the new 26-inch
photographic telescope, which Sir Henry Thompson has undertaken
to present to Greenwich,    I have arranged to allow complete circum-
polar motion so that this reversing on the meridian w 11 not be
                                                              Y 2

necessary, and the telescope will follow any star through the whole
of its path in the heavens so long as it is above our horizon.
     But no matter how perfect the instrument may be in all the
details above spoken of, it is not possible to attain the necessary
perfection of motion without a good clock, and      I thought it would be
interesting for you to see the working of such a clock, and have here
one which is identical with those used in the standard instruments
of the International Photographic Survey. This clock is the com
bination of a good factional governor, supplemented by a system of
control from an independent pendulum.          Perhaps you will allow me
to explain why this control is necessary. A clock such as this will
go well and smoothly and keep good time from second to second, but
no uniform motion clock that     I  have ever met with can be depended
on for long periods.                I
                         This one, find, can be depended on to about
 1 second in 600, but as it is necessary, or at least desirable, to be
able to depend on the clock for longer periods than this, while no
error of more than ^th part of a second can be permitted, it is evi
dently necessary to supplement this by control from an inde
pendent pendulum which can be relied upon to the required amount
 of accuracy.
      There is another very important reason why an independent
control is necessary.      When an error occurs in the clock driving,
owing perhaps     to some morsel  of adventitious matter in the bearings
of the polar axis, or some little extra stiffness due to want of perfect
balance, &c., the tendency of all these governors is to bring the rate
of the clock which has been disturbed back again to the normal.
This answers perfectly well for visual work because, if such an
accidental error does take place occasionally, it merely means that
the star slightly shifts in the field and the wires can be again brought
up to the star and a satisfactory measurement taken, provided that
the image does not again shift during the few seconds required for
 taking the observation.
      But in the case of the photographic  telescope such an error would
 be fatal, because the star has already    impressed the photo plate at
 one certain point.    When the error occurs the image shifts, and even
 if the rate of the clock continues perfectly right for the whole of the
 remainder of the exposure, the result will be of course a double or
 distorted image.
      In photographic work we require some arrangement by which
 any error which is accidentally introduced will be effectually and as
 quickly as possible wiped out, the star image brought back again to
 its original position on the plate and then the clock to resume its
 normal rate, and this is a condition which no uncontrolled clock can
  fulfil. The only solution which has yet been suggested to fulfil these
  conditions is to have some means by which the clock of the equatorial
             I
  (which, as said, goes well and smoothly for short intervals) is checked

      The lecturer here exhibited in action an equatorial clock controlled
from an independent pendulum as above described, with an arrangement
 of bells added by which the audience were enabled to judge of the perfect
 synchronism of the controlled clock and the controlling pendulum.      The
 lecturer purposely introduced errors into the clock train to illustrate the
power of the controlling apparatus to erase these errors.
     Suppose now we have our clock as perfect as is possible, it is
 further necessary to see that that perfectly uniform motion is trans
 mitted to the instrument ; in other words, that any gearing between
 the controlled clock and the polar axis be as far as possible without
error.     This gearing consists mainly of the endless screw, called
the right ascension screw, and the toothed sector. The precautions
taken for the ensuring of this perfection have been elsewhere de
scribed, and are of too technical a character to deal with here, but one
observation only    I would desire to make.
     In a recent paper by Professor Pickering, commenting on instru
ments he saw during a recent visit over here, he is kind enough to
make complimentary allusions to some of these arrangements, but he
 takes exception to the use by us in this country of long radius sectors
for driving the polar axis instead of entire circles. Perhaps it may
be well, therefore, if     I  take this opportunity of saying why we
prefer the sector.
     Bear in mind that the greatest possible perfection of clock driving
 is what we are aiming at, and you will easily see our reason for adopt
ing the sector. When a sector or portion 'of a circle only is used it
 is possible to get a radius much greater than in the case of an entire
 circle.
     No mechanism ever made is absolutely free from error.         Call the
 residual error of this screw anything you like, one 10-thousandth or
 one 20-thousandth of an inch ; whatsoever that error be its effect on
 the accuracy of the driving of the telescope will be exactly in the
 inverse ratio of the radius at which it acts ; therefore any given error
 will only have one-third the effect on the driving of the telescope if
 working (as it may in a sector) at three times the radius. One
 10-thousandth of an inch at say 10-inch radius will produce an
 angular error of about 2 seconds of arc ; at 30 inches radius it will only
 produce two-thirds of a second error.    This may seem a small advan
tage, but the nearer we approach to perfection the more difficult it is
to obtain any given increment.
     It  does not take much coal to increase the speed of a locomotive
from 10 to 11 miles an hour, but it is very different       if   we want to
increase it the same 10 per cent. from say 60 to 66.
     Another fact that has been brought to light by the experiments
 of the last few years is that atmospheric disturbance, the bete noire
 of the astronomer, has not so much effect on most of these photo
 graphic results as in the case of visual observations.
     In the number of the 'Observatory' published in December 1889,
 Dr. Gill makes the following remarks in a note accompanying a

310                         Sir Howard Grubb                  [May 25,
specimen photograph which he sent over.
                                               " The picture is sent in
corroboration of a fact   I have suspected for some time, viz. that for
stellar photographs, after a certain period of exposure, it is quite
immaterial whether the atmospheric definition is good or bad, the
photographic images of stars will be equally sharp in either case.
That good measurable pictures can be taken on nights when refined
eye observations of any value are impossible is a very remarkable
fact, and one that a priori would probably be deemed unlikely.      The
explanation appears to be that the discs on the developed film which
represents stars are very much larger than the minute circle formed
 by the converging cone of rays from the object glass at its inter
 section with the plane of the film.  These discs are produced by so-
 called photographic irradiation; in other words, by chemical action
 set up in the film, having origin in the central point of light, and
 extending gradually and symmetrically over a wider radius from
 that centre. This being so, whenever the radius of the disc becomes
 greater than the radius of extreme oscillation of the optical image
 from a mean point, the resultant photographic action produced by
 the rapidly moving point of light becomes identical with the effect
 produced by a similar steady point of light occupying the same
 mean position."
       Again, in the case of some of the spectroscopic methods of
 observation, more particularly when a slit is used, this peculiarity of
  the photographic method is perhaps still more apparent.
       On this subject Dr. Gill, in a lecture delivered in this theatre
 just three years ago, says, " On account of irregularities in atmo
  spheric refraction, the image of a star in the telescope is rarely
  tranquil, sometimes it shines brightly in the centre of the slit,
  sometimes barely in the slit at all, and the eye becomes puzzled
  and confused. But the photographic eye is not in the least disturbed ;
  when the star image is on the slit the plate goes on recording what
  it sees, and when the star is not on the slit the plate does nothing,
  and it is of no consequence whatever how rapidly these alternate
  appearances and disappearances recur.     The only difference is that
  when the star is steady and the star's image therefore always on the
  slit, the exposure takes less time than when the star is unsteady.
  That is one reason why the Potsdam results, in the determination
  of stellar motion in the line of sight, are so accurate. And there
  are many other reasons besides, into which       I cannot now enter.
  What, however, it is important to note is this, that we have here a
  method which is to a great extent independent of the atmospheric
  disturbances which in all other departments of astronomical obser
  vation have imposed a limit to their precision."
       Those who are familiar with the use of large telescopes, know
  only too well that the larger the aperture the fewer are the oppor
 tunities on which it can be used with advantage, and the question
 has often been discussed as to whether the useful limit of aperture
 has not already been reached, except in cases when it may be possible

to transport the instrument to Arequipa or some such favoured
locality. No doubt large instruments so placed ought to be, and
are, capable of doing much more and better work than if placed in
a less favoured spot, say in the neighbourhood of a town, but ex
perience has shown that other influences often arise which militate
against the possibility of taking full advantage out of the improved
locality. The conditions of life in some such isolated stations are not
the pleasantest, and though human nature may put up with incon
veniences and unpleasantness as a temporary arrangement, for the sake
of science, yet, as a permanency, this state of things is not found
compatible with the production of the best work, and in some cases
 it has been found necessary to send relays of workers to these
 isolated stations, a plan, no doubt, which meets to some extent this
 difficulty, but is evidently open to other objections.
        If  however, as it appears, the new photographic           system is
 to a great extent independent of atmospheric disturbance, it ought
  to be possible not only to use, and use with efficiency, large instru
  ments in situations within measurable distance of the haunts of
  civilisation (a great gain in itself), but it will also be possible to
  use with advantage, even in such accessible positions, instruments of
  far greater power than have ever yet been built, and of whose
  practical value there have been well founded doubts so long as the
  old system of eye observations was the only one available.
        When this fact forces itself upon the attention of the scientific
   world, as it must do before long, and the necessity of adding to
   the power of our telescopes becomes apparent, there is little doubt
   but that the means will be found to satisfy the necessity ; but as the
   magnitude of these instruments becomes greater, the importance of
   studying beforehand the necessary conditions to fulfil and the
   mistakes to be avoided becomes all the greater, and therefore      I have
   thought it may not be amiss to bring under your notice a few
   suggestions as to the possibility of obtaining increased optical power
   in our   telescopes.
         Ueforo we discuss the conditions to be fulfilled in the case of the
   mounting of more powerful telescopes, perhaps it would be well to
    get a clear idea of what is meant by the power of a telescope as
   distinct from magnifying power. You are aware that most of the
    work done with our very large refractors is done with magnifying
    powers which are equally useable with instruments of half the aper
    ture or less, but it must not be assumed that the power of the
    instrument (used in its broad sense, i.e. its capability of distinctly
    viewing minute objects, or the details of such) is then only tho samo
    as that of the smaller instrument used with the same magnifying
    power.     On the contrary, Jupiter or Saturn viewed with a power of
    600, with 28 inches aperture, is a very different object to what it is
    when viewed with the same magnifying power and an aperture of say
    8 or 10 inches.     This is not due to extra brilliancy from the larger
    amount of light collected by the bigger object-glass, for even in the

812                          Sir Howard Grubb                    [May 25,
case of observing the moon (say), when it is necessary to use tinted
screens to moderate the brilliancy, this superiority of the larger aper
ture is just as evident, but it may be explained in this way : —
     In a lecture by Dr. Common, delivered in this theatre in May
1890, he gave a very neat explanation of the fact that a certain
amount of magnification of image is required in order to see a certain
amount of detail in that image. He showed that the sensation by
which the brain is excited is carried from the retina by an enormous
number of fine nerves, which are excited by small bodies called tech
nically " rods and cones," and that each of these produces one distinct
sensation as relating to the particular part of the image which falls on
that particular part of the retina ; the image, therefore, as presented to
the brain is a kind of mosaic, and it is evident that the larger the
image that falls on the retina the finer will the mosaic be in propor
tion to the details of the image, and therefore the better will the
details be appreciated.
     A similar explanation may be given of the different character of
the image given by large aperture telescopes and small.        The image
of a star, as given by a telescope's objective, is not exactly a point ; it
is, owing to certain physical reasons which it would be impossible to
enter into in this lecture, in the form of a small disc of light which,
if the object is of a sufficient brilliancy, is surrounded by diffraction
 rings.    The diameter of this spurious disc depends amongst other
conditions on the diameter of the object-glass ; the larger the diameter
of the object-glass the smaller the diameter of the disc ; in other words,
the discs, as seen in large object-glasses, are smaller than those seen in
smaller object-glasses ; or putting it in another way, if a certain size
of object-glass be found to give a spurious disc of a certain size,
reducing the aperture of the object-glass will increase the size of the
spurious disc.
     Every object may be considered to be made up of an infinity of
points, of every one of which the object-glass gives an image in the
form of a little disc. It is evident that the image that is made up of
the larger spurious discs will not be as fine or as delicate, or show as
much detail as that made up with the smaller discs. The image of
such an object as Jupiter or Saturn as seen in the small telescope,
compared with that as seen in the large telescope, will be as a drawing
made in the first case with a coarse crayon or stump, to that made in
the second case with a finely pointed lead pencil ; or we may compare
the first to a very coarse mezzotint engraving, while the second may
be compared to the very finest work that can possibly be turned out.
     This is the reason that the larger aperture telescope, even when
used withNpowers corresponding only to those which can be effec
tively used with a smaller instrument, show objects with a clearness
and                that it is impossible to obtain in the smaller instru
      distinctness
ment, no matter how perfect the workmanship may be.
     And now we come to the question of the probabilities of our

these greater difficulties mean increased cost for an equally good
mounting.     I   believe this simple economic question has much to
answer for in bringing the reflector into disrepute with many.                  It
has often been remarked that the reflectors that have been best
worked have been constructed and worked by amateurs, the reason,
to a great extent, being that this economic point does not then
enter so largely into the question.

     Only within the last month Dr. Johnstone Stoney has devised                                a
most ingenious arrangement for supporting the great mirrors of
reflecting telescopes on an air support, graduating the 'pressure

contrivance.     Possibly this apparatus in its present form may be
capable of improvement, but it is at least a step, and a very impor
tant step, in the direction of solving one of the most troublesome and
difficult problems to be met with in the attempt to obtain a really
satisfactory mounting for reflecting telescopes.
      That the reflecting telescope is capable of doing excellent work in
the hands of those who take sufficient cure and trouble with the
adjustment and in the working, is sufficiently evidenced in the results
 obtained by Draper, De la Eue, Common and Roberts, but the fact is
that to obtain good results with the reflector in its present imperfect
 state of development, more labour and patience is required than most
observers care to bestow on the work, and there is much to be said in
excuso for this, for if an astronomer's time be taken up with the neces
 sary attention to the details of his instrument he will not be able to
 pay that undivided attention otherwise possible, and at all times
desirable, for his more legitimate work in the obtaining of results
 with that instrument.     The fact that the reflector brings all rays of
light   to a  common    focus, irrespective of their wave-lengths, while
the refractor is at best but a compromise, tells strongly in favour of
the ultimate success of the reflector over its rival.
      True, it may be said that the experiments in glass-making that
have been carried on for some years at the Jena glass manufactory
 may yet eventuate in producing qualities of glass which will remove
this reproach from the refractor, and enable us to perfectly balance
the chromatic error, and at the same time be of a sufficiently per
manent character to justify its use in the case of large objectives.
No one would be foolish enough to attempt to make a large objective
of any material which was not known from previous experience to be
capable of preserving its perfection of surface for at least 20 or 25
years.
      Unfortunately there is no test of permanency except the lapse of
years ; even if therefore some such glass were in existence at the present
time, no maker who had any desire that his name should live after
him in his work, would care to use this untried material until actual
experience proved its character for permanence.        This, and the fact
that it has not yet been found possible to produce perfect pieces of
this Jena glass of one-tenth of the weight of those already produced
of the more ordinary varieties of optical glass, cuts off any hope we
might otherwise have of being able for the present to produce large
objectives with perfect correction for the chromatic aberration, and
so long as this is the case, the reflector, which treats rays of all
refrangibilities alike, has in this respect the advantage.
      When we consider that the largest optical discs ever yet pro
duced, and which were rightly considered a perfect triumph of art, are
only 40 inches in diameter, and that on the other hand Lord Rosse's
reflector of 72 inches diameter is now half a century old, it is tolerably
evident that for the present, at least, we must look to reflectors if we
want to increase to any large extent the power of our telescopes.
     With this view, and understanding that it is likely an attempt

will  be made to build an 8 or 10-foot reflector for the great exhibition
to be held in Paris in 1900, it may be interesting to consider the
conditions desirable to be fulfilled for such an instrument, and the
most promising       construction   to satisfy those conditions.     If a
monster telescope, such as this, is to be mounted only in such a
manner as will satisfy the ordinary conditions of star gazing,            I
fear the results will be disappointing, but let it be mounted in such
a manner as to render it useable for the more delicate and refined
work of the modern astronomy, and a grand and productive field of
work is open to it.
     But the problem of mounting an enormous instrument such as
this, whose weight would probably amount to from 50 to 100 tons,
so perfectly poised and so accurately driven by clockwork as never
to vary from its true position by a quantity greater than the
apparent motion of a star in one-twentieth of a second of time, is
 sufficiently difficult to justify almost a doubt of its possibility, and
 this difficulty has been appreciated by others ; for Dr. Common, who,
as the maker of the largest equatorially mounted reflector ever
 completed, must be considered as the first authority, proposed some
 short time since to resort to the alt-azimuth form of mounting, with
 which it would, of course, be impossible to satisfy the above condition.
      Dr. Common himself has made a splendid advance in adopting
 the system of flotation of the polar axis ; this principle of flotation
 appears to me to be capable of further development.       It is perfectly
 possible to make a tube for a Newtonian reflecting telescope (which
 is necessarily closed at the lower end) of such a weight, and with
 its weight so distributed that it will not only float in water sub
 merged to a certain point (preferably near the upper end), but will
 be in a state of equilibrium when placed at any or in every position
 down to a certain angle, which angle depends on the exact outside
 form of the tube.      For instance, if AB (Fig. 1) be a tube closed at
 B and perfectly symmetrical round the axis A B, and the total
 weight of the tube be equal to the weight of water which is dis
 placed when the tube is sunk to C, tho weight of the different

1894.]                 on the Astronomical  Telescope.                  317
sections along the axis A B can be ro distributed that the tube will
equally well remain in any other position, except it be so far turned
over that the cylindrical part of the tube is lifted out of the water at
one end and dipped at the other.
     By making the spherical part of about the proportions of the
figure, the tube can be depressed to within 25° of the horizon, and
still remain in perfect equilibrium.
     Now, suppose the tube to have a pair of trunnions attached at the
water line, and these carried on a polar axis of, say, the English type
(see Fig. 2), we have an equatorially-mounted        telescope of any size,
without any weight whatever on the bearings of the Dec axis, or, the
tube may be lightened by an amount nearly equal to the weight of
the polar axis, and there will then be practically no weight whatever
on the bearings of that axis. So here we have a case of, say, an 80-
ton telescope mounted and carried by an equatorial, but without
throwing any weight whatever on that equatorial ; and the force
necessary to drive the instrument is independent of the weight of the
 telescope, and dependent only on the friction necessary to be over
 come in carrying the tube at an exceedingly slow rate through the
 water.
      Let us inquire into any possible disadvantages that may be urged
 against this form of mounting : —
      1. That the temperature of the water will often be different from
 that of the air ; and consequently that there will be a detrimental
 mixture, at the mouth of the tube, of air from inside the tube, which
 will partake of the temperature of the water, with the outside air.
 This   I   would propose to avoid by making the tube double, with a
 space   of some 3 inches between inside and outside tubes, hermetically
 closed except at the lower end, where there would be apertures in the
 inside envelope. The space between the two tubes would be connected
 through the trunnions with an air pump, worked by a gas or other
 motor, which would continually exhaust the air from between the two
 tubes, and thus cause a current of the outside air to pass continually
 down the tube and back to the pump by the space between the two
 tubes. This would keep the temperature of the inside tube and the
 air in the tube constant with that of the outside air.
      2. The limited range of the equatorial.      I  have stated that the
 instrument would be in perfect balance down to 25° from the horizon.
  If desired, though no longer perfectly balanced, it can be used lower
 by employing a chain or wire rope connected between the lower end
 of the tube and the upper end of the polar axis, and the amount which
  the instrument would be out of balance, between 25° and 20°, would
  be very trifling.
      Again, it will not be convenient to use the instrument within
  some 15° of the pole.    It could be planned to go somewhat closer,
  but when it is considered that nine-tenths of the work required to be
  done can be commanded by this instrument, it is clearly better to
  design it to do that nine-tenths well than to strain it into doing
  another 5° that would only be useful on very rare occasion'.

318                                 Sir Howard Orubb                    [May   25,
     3. It may be urged that the friction of the water will prevent the
rapid setting of the instrument.             In a telescope of this size all the
motions would be effected by motors of some description, guided by
the observer from a commutator-board at the eye end, and there would
be no difficulty in setting the telescope quite as quickly as could
be expected considering its great size.
     4. It may be objected that currents will be set up in the water by
the moving of the telescope, which currents will affect the steadiness.
No doubt this will bo the case to some extent, but these will soon
subside, and the motion necessary for fallowing the stars will be so
slow that no perceptible effect of this kind will be felt from it.
     As to convenience in getting at the eye end, there need be no
difficulty whatever in this form. As the eye-piece is only about 15
fett from the centre of motion, the movement of the observer is never
more than 3 feet per hour.              By means of a platform such as that
shown in Fig. 2, running on rails, and quite independent of the
instrument, the eye end is readily accessible at all times.             To over
come the rotation of the tube as the instrument                  moves in right
ascension,      I  would pierce the tube for eye-pieces every 30° round its
circumference, and mount the flat mirror and cell in a collar so as to
enable it to be readily rotated through intervals of 30°.                By these
means the image of the celestial object to be observed could be sent
through either or any of the perforations of the tube, and the observer
always observe in the direction most convenient to himself.
     There are various difficulties about this construction which may
naturally suggest themselves, but there are none,               I believe, which
cannot be overcome.
     This is hardly the place to discuss details, but if there be any
here who are sufficiently interested in this new form of equatorial to
desire further information,           I  would refer them to an article in the
                                                '
                                  '               which deals with most of the
present month's issue of Knowledge
difficulties.
     Putting aside now the question of reflectors versus refractors,
there are some directions, applicable equally to reflectors and re
fractors, in which it is evidently possible to improve our designs for
large equatorial instruments.                                              I
                                           It is not the first time that have
urged similar developments,             but  the advantages of what     I  recom
mended were          not   so  apparent   then  as they are  now  in the  present
advanced state of astronomical research.
                                                   I
     It may be remembered that when lectured here in the year
1886     I  strongly urged the desirability of employing some form of
motive power for carrying out the various motions required in
manipulating the large equatorials, domes, txc, and exhibited a model
design     I  had made for the Lick Observatory, which illustrated the
manner       in   which these various motors could bo controlled by the
observer,     as   well as the then newly devised lifting floor arrangement.
The    latter,    that is the lifting floor, was, as you are aware, adopted by
the trustees       of  the                            I
                             Lick Observatory, and suppose we may assume
that  it  was    considered     a success, as it has been copied in the case of

1894.]                 on the Astronomical   Telescope.               319
tho two large observatories built since in the United States, viz. the
Washington and the Chicago Observatories.              The Lick Trustees,
however, rejected the proposals for the employment of motors for the
equatorial movements and dome.         That experience gained since the
construction of this telescope has confirmed the correctness of my
views as respects the desirability of adopting this system is evident,
as, in their latest and most perfect instrument, that of the Yerkes
equatorial at Chicago, practically all the suggested improvements in
that model exhibited before you in 1886 have been adopted, and           I
hope will contribute in no small degree to the quantity as well as the
quality of the output of work we may expect from that splendid
instrument ; but to show that this by no means represents all that
can be done in this direction,      I  have here a rough and unfinished
model of an observatory in which the principle is carried still
further.
     It will be observed that in the Lick design the astronomer is
relieved of all physical exertion, but still his attention is required
during all the process of setting of the instrument.         In our latest
design we are able to relieve the astronomer of even the mental
strain in this way. In some of our modern equatorials tho setting of
the circles can be placed (by a new arrangement) at the eye end of
the telescope. Suppose this to be so arranged in the large telescope
and that an arrangement be added something similar in principle to
the steam steering gear of our large steamers, with which every one
is now familiar. In this machine the construction is such that when
a small light wheel is turned any quantity to port or starboard the
motors are automatically set to work and force the helm over in the
right direction, and do not stop until the position of the helm itself
exactly corresponds to that of the light guiding wheel.           A very
 simple arrangement of electrical contacts suffices to effect this in the
 case of the telescope, and the working of the instrument is effected
 thus : —
     The astronomer decides what AR and what DEC he desires the
 telescope to bo set at, he walks over to the eye end of the telescope,
 which, as will be soen further, can only be at a convenient height
 from the floor, and sets a pair of pointers at tho eye end to the
 particular readings he wishes, and then presses a button to start the
 motors and " awaits developments."
      Without any more attention from the astronomer the instrument
 now sets itself in exactly the position he requires, the motors
 continuing to revolve the telescope on its axes till that position is
 attained, and then they stop.        Meanwhile as certain contacts are
 arranged at the upper end of the tube connected with the motor
 which drives the dome, and at the lower end with motors which elevate
 and depress the floor, the dome revolves if necessary and keeps the
 opening opposite the upper end of the telescope, while the floor rises
 and falls as maybe necessary, always keeping at a convenient distance
 below the eye end ; and so, as          I said, without any attention or
 physical or mental strain on the part of the observer, he finds after a

   320         Sir Howard Orvbb   on the Astronomical   Telescope.  [May 25,
  few minutes his telescope set correctly in AR and Decn — the dome
  opening is opposite the object-glass and the floor at a height most
  convenient for observation.
       The idea may seem almost Utopian, but there are no particular
  difficulties in carrying it out, nor would it add sensibly to the cost of
  a large instrument.
           I
       If have succeeded, even very imperfectly, in rendering a neces-
. sarily    technical, and therefore somewhat dry, subject sufficiently
  interesting to have enabled you to follow me, you will have no
  difficulty in seeing that the principal ideas    I  desired to convey may
  be summed up shortly in this way : —
       That, while on the one hand, the adoption of new methods for
  prosecuting astronomical research have created a set of conditions
  under which it is possible to use, and use with advantage, instruments
  of greater optical power than hitherto, yet, on the other hand, the
  mechanical arrangements for mounting these instruments must be of
  a much higher standard than has been necessary for the older
  methods ; in fact, they must be mounted as instruments of precision,
  in the highest sense of the term, and while the mounting of instru
  ments even larger than we have at present and suitable to the older
  conditions would not present any serious engineering difficulties, the
  problem of mounting them as instruments of precision is one of con
  siderable magnitude — a fact which is well recognised by those who
  have studied the subject.
       The time has gone by when with very few inches increase of
  aperture some sensational discovery is expected.
       The astronomer of the future will not be satisfied with mere star
  gazing instruments.      The experiments of the last few years show
  that there is no royal road to great astronomical discoveries, but that
  patient, honest and self-recording work is necessary to enable us to
  add (as our ambition is) course after course to the great edifice of
  astronomical truth.
       But the ever-advancing work of the astronomer demands an ever-
  increasing perfection of his instruments, and the records of the past
  show that few of these improvements are to be credited either entirely
  to the astronomer, be he ever so practical, or to the instrument-maker,
  however ingenious, but to both working harmoniously together, the
  astronomer finding out the weak points of existing instruments, and
  the instrument-maker continually devising new contrivances to meet
  the difficulties of the astronomer.
       I myself would like to take this opportunity of saying that what
  ever measure of success     I may have had in my work is due in no
  small degree to the helpful kindness     I  have invariably received from
  those astronomers with whom      I have been in communication.
       As it has been in the past, so, let us hope, it will be in the future,
  for in this harmonious working together of those who design and
  those who work the instruments lies our strongest hope of the future
  development of the astronomical telescope.

The untimely end of a young and brilliant     career cannot fail to strike
a noteof sadness and awaken a chord of        sympathy in the hearts of
his friends and fellow-workers.    Of men thus cut down in the early
prime of their powers there will occur to us here the names of
Fresnel, of Carnot, of Clifford, and now of Hertz. His was a
strenuous and favoured youth; he was surrounded from his birth
with all the influences that go to make an accomplished man of
science — accomplished both on the experimental and on the mathe
matical sido. The front rank of scientific workers is weaker by his
death, which occurred on January 1, 1894, the thirty-seventh year of
his life. Yet did he not go till he had effected an achievement which
will hand his name down to posterity as the founder of an epoch in
experimental physics.
      In mathematical and speculative physics others had sown the
seed.     It was sown by Faraday, it was sown by Thomson and by
Stokes, by Weber also doubtless, and by Helmholtz ; but in this
 particular department it was sown by none more fruitfully and
 plentifully than by Clerk Maxwell. Of the seed thus sown Hertz
 reaped the fruits. Through his experimental discovery, Germany
 awoke to the truth of Clerk Maxwell's theory of light, of light and
 electricity combined, and the able army of workers in that country
 (not forgetting some in Switzerland, France and Ireland) have done
 most of the gleaning after Hertz.
      This is the work of Hertz which is best known, the work which
 brought him immediate fame. It is not always that public notice is
 so well justified. The popular instinct is generous and trustful, and
  it is apt to be misled. The scientific eminence accorded to a few
  energetic persons by popular estimate is more or less amusing to those
  working on the same lines. In the case of Hertz no sur.-h rnihUko
  has been made.   His name is not over well known, and his work is

     In closing these introductory and personal remarks, should like
to say that the enthusiastic admiration for Hertz's spirit and character,
felt and expressed by students and workers who came into contact with
him, is not easily to be exaggerated. Never was a man more painfully
anxious to avoid wounding the susceptibilities of others ; and he was
accustomed to deprecate the prominence given to him by speakers
and writers in this country, lest it might seem to exalt him unduly
above other and older workers among his own sensitive countrymen.
     Speaking of the other great workers in physics in Germany, it is
not out of place to record the sorrow with which we have heard of the
recent death of Dr. August Kundt, Professor in the University of
Berlin, successor to Von Helmholtz in that capacity.
              I
     When consented to discourse on the work of Hertz, my intention
was to repeat some of his actual experiments, and especially to demon
strate his less known discoveries and observations.         But the fascination
exerted upon me by electric oscillation experiments, when I, too, was
independently working at them in the spring of 1888,* resumed its
hold, and my lecture will accordingly                consist of experimental
demonstrations of the outcome of Hertz's work rather than any
precise repetition of portions of that work itself.
      In case a minority of my audience are in the predicament of not
knowing anything about the subject, a five minutes' explanatory
prelude may be permitted, though time at present is very far from
being
         " infinitely long."
      The simplest way will be for me hastily to summarise our know
 ledge of the subject before the era of Hertz.
     Just as a pebble thrown into a pond excites surface ripples, which
 can heave up and down floating straws under which they pass, so a
 struck bell or tuning-fork emits energy into the air in the form of
 what are called sound waves, and this radiant energy is able to set up
 vibrations in other suitable elastic bodies.
      If  the body receiving them has its natural or free vibrations
 violently damped, so that when left to itself it speedily returns to
 rest, Fig. 1, then it can respond fully to notes of almost any pitch.
 This is the case with your ears and the tones of my voice. Tones
 must be exceedingly shrill before they cease to excite the ear at all.
      If, on the other hand, the receiving body has a persistent period
 of vibration, continuing in motion long after it is left to itself, Fig. 2,
 like another tuning fork or bell, for instance, then far more facility of
 response exists, but great accuracy of tuning is necessary if it is to be
 fully called out ; for if the receiver is not thus accurately syntonised
 with the source, it fails more or loss completely to resound.

    Conversely, if the source is a persistent vibrator, correct tuning is
essential, or it will destroy at one moment, Fig. 3, motion which it
originated the previous moment. Whereas, if it is a dead-beat or
strongly-damped exciter, almost anything will respond equally well
or equally ill to it.

microphone, when spoken to, emits waves into the ether, and this
radiant energy is likewise able to set up vibration in suitable bodies.
But we have no delicate means of directly detecting these electrical
or ethereal waves ; and if they are to produce a perceptible effect at a
distance, they must be confined, as by a speaking-tube, prevented from
spreading, and concentrated on the distant recoiver.

surgo to and fro several times first; and these surgings or electric
oscillations must, according to Maxwell, start waves in the ether,

middle of each half-swing they cause electromagnetic effects, and the
rapid alternation from one of these modes of energy to the other con
stitutes ethereal waves.*            If

in the path of such waves, conductors adapted for the occurrence in
them of induced electric oscillations, and to the surprise of every one,
himself, doubtless, included, he found that the secondary electric
surgings thus excited were strong enough to display themselves by
minute electric sparks.

as far as possible we get a typical Hertz vibrator, Fig. 5, whose dielec
tric extends out into the room, and this radiates very powerfully.
    In consequence of its radiation of energy, its vibrations are
rapidly damped, and it only gives some three or four good strong

tion ; i. e. it can excite sparks in conductors barely at all in tune
with it.
      The two conditions, conspicuous energy of radiation and persis
tent vibration electrically produced, are at present incompatible.

                              The receiver Hertz used was chiefly a circular
                         resonator, Fig. 6, not a good absorber but a per

     Any circular resonator can  be used as a sender by bringing its knobs
        near the sparking knobs of a coil ; but a simple arrangement is to
        take two semicircles, as in above figure, and make them the coil
        terminals. The capacity of the cut ends can be varied, and the period
        thereby lengthened, by expanding them into plates.
previously calculated length of the waves was thoroughly borne out by
fact. These interference experiments in free space are his greatest
achievement.
      He worked out every detail of the theory splendidly, separately
analysing the electric and the magnetic oscillation, using language

theoretic insight through the medium of what would have been to
most physicists a confusing maze of troublesome facts, and disen
tangling all their main relations most harmoniously.
     While Hertz was observing sparks such as these, the primary or
exciting spark and the secondary or excited one, he observed as a bye-
issue that the secondary spark occurred more easily if the light from
the primary fell upon its knobs.         He examined this new influence of
light in many ways, and showed that although spark light and electric
brush light were peculiarly effective, any source of light that gave
very ultra-violet rays produced the same result.

    Experiment arranged to show effect on one spark of light from another.
       The B spark occurs more easily when it can see the A spark
        through the window, unless the window is glazed with glass.     A
       quartz pane transmits the effect.
     The above figure represents my way of showing the experiment.
 It will  be observed that with this arrangement the B knobs are at the
 same potential up to the instant of the flash, and in that case the
 ultra-violet portion of the light of the A spark assists the occurrence
 of the B spark. But it is interesting to note, what Elster and Geitel
 have found, that if the B knobs were subjected to steady strain instead
 of to impulsive rush —e. g. if they were connected to the inner coats of
 the jars instead of to the outer coatings — that then the effect of ultra
 violet light on either spark-gap would exert a deterrent influence, so
 that the spark would probably occur at the other, or non-illuminated

gap.     With   these altered connections it is, of course, not feasible to
illuminate    one spark by the light of the other ; the sparks are then
alternative, not successive.
     Wiedemann and Ebert, and a number of experimenters, have
repeated and extended this discovery, proving that it is the cathode
knob on which illumination takes effect ; and Hall wachs and Righi
independently made the important observation, which Elster and
Geitel, Stoletow, Branly and others have extended, that a freshly-
polished zinc or other oxidisable surface, if charged negatively, is
gradually discharged by ultra-violet light.
     It is easy to fail in reproducing this experimental result if the
right conditions are not satisfied ; but if they are it is absurdly easy,
and the thing might have been observed nearly a century ago.

    Zinc Knob in Aro Light, protected by Glass         Screen. The lenses are
       of quartz, but there is no need for any lenses in this experiment ;
        leakage begins directly the glass plate is withdrawn.
     Take a piece of zinc, clean it with emery paper, connect it to a
gold leaf electroscope, and expose it to an arc lamp, Fig. 8.                 If
charged positively nothing appears to happen, the action is very slow ;
but a negative charge leaks away in a few seconds if the light is bright.
Any source of light rich in ultra-violet rays will do; the light
from a spark is perhaps most powerful of all.               A pane of glass cuts
off all the action ; so does atmospheric air in sufficient thickness (at
any rate, town air), hence sunlight is not powerful.            A pane of quartz
transmits the action almost undiminished, but fluor-spar may be more
transparent still.      Condensing the arc rays with a quartz lens and
analysing them with a quartz prism or reflection grating, we find
that the most effective part of the light is high up in the ultra

    * While preparing for the lecture it occurred to me to try, if possible during
the lecture itself, some new experiments on the effect of light on negatively
charged bits of rock and ice, because if the effect is not limited to metals it must
be important in connection with atmospheric electricity.          When Mr. Branly
coated an aluminium plate with an insulating varnish, he found that its charge
was able to soak in and out of the varnish during illumination (' Comptes Bendus,'
vol. ex. p. 898, 1890).  Now, the mountain tops of a negatively charged earth are
exposed to very ultra-violet rays, and the air is a dielectric in which quiet up-
carrying and sudden downpour of electricity could go on in a manner not very
unlike the well-known behaviour of water vapour ; and this, perhaps, may be the
reason, or one of the reasons, why it is not unusual to experience a thunderstorm

illumination.
       Return now to the Hertz vibrator, or Leyden jar with its coatings
well separated, so that we can get into its electric as well as its magnetic
field.      Here is a great one giving waves 30 metres long, radiating
while it lasts with an activity of 100 H.P., and making ten million
complete electric vibrations per second (Fig. 10).
       Its great radiating power damps it down very rapidly, so that it
does not make above two or three swings ; but nevertheless, each
time it is excited, sparks can be drawn from most of the reasonably
elongated conductors in this theatre.
       A suitably situated gas-leak can be ignited by these induced
 sparks.       An Abel's fuse connecting the water pipes with the gas

 (this fact has been familiar to all who have worked with Hertz waves
 since 1889) ; electric leads, if anywhere near each other, as they are
 in   some incandescent lamp holders, may spark across to each other,
 thus striking an arc and blowing their fuses. This blowing of fuses
 by electric radiation frequently happened at Liverpool till the
 suspensions of the theatre lamps were altered.

 after a few fine days.     I  have now tried these experiments on such geological
 fragments as were handy, and find that many of them discharge negative elec
  tricity under the action of a naked arc, especially from the side of the specimens
  which was somewhat dusty, but that when wet they discharge much less rapidly,
  and when positively charged hardly at all. Ice and garden soil discharge negative
  electrification, too, under ultra-violet illumination, but not so quickly as limestone,
  mica schist, ferruginous quartz, clay and some other specimens.          Granite barely
  acts : it seems to insulate too well. The ice and soil were tried in their usual
  moist condition, but, when thoroughly dry, soil discharges quite rapidly.           No
  rock tested was found to discharge as quickly as does a surface of perfectly bright
  metal, such as iron, but many discharged much more quickly than ordinary
  dull iron, and rather more quickly than when the bright iron surface was thinly
  oiled or wetted with water. To-day (June 5)         I find that the leaves of Geranium
  discharge positive electrification five times as quickly as negative, under the
  action of an arc-light, and that glass cuts the effect off while quartz transmits it.

     Many of these senders will do for receivers too, giving off sparks
to other insulated bodies or to earth ; but, besides the Hertz type of
receiver, many other detectors of radiation have been employed.
Vacuum tubes can be used, either directly or on the trigger principle,
as by Zehnder, Fig. 13,| the resonator spark precipitating a discharge
from some auxiliary battery or source of energy, and so making a
feeble disturbance very visible.              Explosives may be used for the
same purpose, either in the form of mixed water-gases or in the form
of an Abel's fuse.        Fitzgerald found that a tremendously sensitive

 galvanometer could indicate that a feeble spark had passed, by reason
 of the consequent disturbance of electrical equilibrium which settled
 down again through the galvanometer.^                  This was the method he
 used in this theatre four years ago.            Blyth used a one-sided electro
 meter, and V. Bjerknes has greatly developed this method, Fig. 14,
 abolishing the need for a spark, and making the electrometer metrical,
 integrating and satisfactory.§          With this detector many measurements
 have been made       at  Bonn by Bjerknes, Yule, Barton, and others, on
 waves concentrated and kept from space dissipation by guiding wires.
      Mr. Boys has experimented on the mechanical force exerted by elec

        but its open circuit is terminated by the quadrants of the electrometer,
        which is shown on an enlarged scale alongside. The needle is at
        zero potential and is attracted by both quadrants.       By calculation
        from the indications of this electrometer Bjerknes plotted the curves
        1, 2 and 3 on page 329.       Fig. 1 represents the oscillations of the
       primary vibrator, rapidly damped by radiation of energy. Fig. 2
       represents   the vibrations thereby set up in the resonating circuit
       when the two are accurately in tune ; and which persist for many
       swings. Fig. 3 shows the vibrations excited in the same circuit
       when slighly out of tune with the exciter. A receiver of this kind
       makes many swings before it is seriously damped.
     And, before all these, the late Mr. Gregory, of Cooper's Hill,
made     his singularly sensitive expansion meter, whereby waves in
free space could be detected by the minute rise of temperature they
caused in a platinum wire, a kind of early and sensitive form of
Cardew voltmeter.         Boys, Briscoe and Watson developed this method.

stimulus of a rapidly alternating character, if pure and unaccompanied
by secondary actions, produces no effect — no stimulating effect, that
is, even though the voltage is so high that sparks are ready to jump
between the needles in direct contact with the nerve.
     All that such oscillations do, if continued, is to produce a tem
porary paralysis or fatigue of the nerve, so that it is unable to
transmit the nerve impulses evoked by other stimuli, from which
paralysis it recovers readily enough in course of time.
    This has been expected from experiments on human beings, such
experiments as Tesla's and those of d'Arsonval.          But an entire
animal is not at all a satisfactory instrument wherewith to attack
the question ; its nerves are so embedded in conducting tissues that
it may easily be doubted whether the alternating type of stimulus ever
reaches them at all. By dissecting out a nerve and muscle from a

  Their sensitiveness is to        me surprising, though of course it does not
  approach the sensitiveness of the eye ; at the same time,              I  am by no
 means sure that the eye differs from them in kind. It is these
 detectors that     I wish specially to bring to your notice.
       Prof. Minchin, whose long and patient work in connection with
 photo-electricity is now becoming known, and who has devised an
 instrument more sensitive to radiation than even Boys' radiomicro-
 meter, in that it responds to the radiation of a star while the
  radiomicrometer        does not, found some years ago that some of his
  light-excitable cells lost their sensitiveness capriciously on tapping,
  and later he found that they frequently regained it again while
 Mr. Gregory's Hertz-wave experiments were going on in the same
 room.
       These " impulsion-cells," as he terms them, are troublesome
 things for ordinary persons to make and work with — at least                  I have
 never presumed to try — but in Mr. Minchin's hands they are
surprisingly sensitive to electric waves.*
       The sensitiveness of selenium to light is known to every one, and
 Mr. Shelford Bidwell has made experiments on the variations of
 conductivity exhibited by a mixture of sulphur and carbon.
       Nearly four years ago M. Edouard Branly found that a burnished
 coat of porphyrised copper spread on glass diminished its resistance
 enormously, from some millions to some hundreds of ohms when it
 was exposed to the neighbourhood, even the distant neighbourhood,
 of Leyden jar or coil sparks. He likewise found that a tube of
 metallic filings behaved similarly, but that this recovered its original
 resistance on shaking. Dr. Dawson Turner exhibited this fact recently
 at the Edinburgh meeting of the British Association, and Mr. Croft
 has shown it to the Physical Society.              M. Branly also made pastes
 and    solid rods  of  filings,  in Canada  balsam   and in sulphur, and found
 them     likewise  sensitive.  \
       With me the matter arose somewhat differently, as an outcome
of the air-gap detector employed with an electroscope by Boltzinann.

 far too close to stand any voltage such as an electroscope can show,

an ordinary bell-ringing current if a single voltaic cell was in circuit ;
and, if there were no such cell, exhibiting an electromotive force
of their own sufficient to disturb a low resistance galvanometer
vigorously, and sometimes requiring a faintly perceptible amount of
force to detach them. The experiment was described to the Institution
of Electrical Engineers,! and Prof. Hughes said he had observed the
same thing.

actual air-gap in that the insulating film is not really insulating ;
the film breaks down not only much more easily, but also in a less
discontinuous and more permanent manner, than an air-gap.                 A tube
of filings, being a series of bad contacts, clearly works on the same
plan ; and though a tube of filings is by no means so sensitive, yet
it is in many respects easier to work with, and, except for very

turnings or borings, the tube approximates to a single coherer ; if
they are fine, it has a larger range of sensibility. In every case
what these receivers feel are sudden jerks of current ; smooth sinuous
vibrations are ineffective.      They seem to me to respond best to waves

the insulating film, except perhaps at one or two atoms.*           If the film
is not permitted to conduct at all, it is not very sensitive ; the most
sensitive condition is obtained when an infinitesimal current passes,
strong enough just to show on a moderate galvanometer.
     Now let the slightest surging occur, say by reason of a sphere
being charged and discharged at a distance of forty yards ; the filir
at once breaks down — perhaps not completely, that is a question of
intensity — but permanently.          As   I imagine, more molecules get
within each other's range, incipient cohesion sets in, and the mo
mentary electric quiver acts somewhat like a flux. It is a singular
variety of electric welding.           A stronger stimulus enables more
molecules to hold on, the process is surprisingly metrical; and, as
 far as I roughly know at present, the change of resistance is propor
tional to the energy of the electric radiation, from a source of given
frequency.
     It is to be specially noted that a battery current is not needed
 to effect the cohesion, only to demonstrate it. The battery can be
applied after the spark has occurred, and the resistance will be found
changed as much as if the battery had been on all the time.
     The incipient cohesion electrically caused can be mechanically
destroyed.     Sound vibrations or any other feeble mechanical dis
 turbances, such as scratches or taps, are well adapted to restore the
contact to its original high-resistance sensitive condition.         The more
feeble the electrical disturbance the slighter is the corresponding
mechanical stimulus needed for restoration.           When working with the
radiating   sphere, Fig.  19,  at  a distance  of  forty yards out of window,
I  could not for this reason shout to my assistant, to cause him to
press the key of the coil and make a spark, but              I  showed him a
duster instead, this being a silent signal which had no disturbing
effect on the coherer or tube of filings.        I  mention 40 yards, because
that was one of the first outdoor experiments ; but            I  should think
that something more like half a mile was nearer the limit of sensi
tiveness.    However, this is a rash statement not at present verified.
 At 40 or 60 yards the exciting spark cculd be distinctly heard, and
it was interesting to watch the spot of light begin its long excursion
and actually travel a distance of 2 inches or 3 inches before the sound
arrived.     This experiment proved definitely enough that the efficient
cause travelled quicker than sound, and disposed completely of any
sceptical doubts as to sound-waves being, perhaps, the real cause of
the phenomenon.
     Invariably, when the receiver is in good condition, sound or other
mechanical disturbance acts one way, viz. in the direction of in
creasing resistance, while electrical radiation or jerks act the other
way, decreasing it. While getting the receiver into condition, or
when it is getting out of order, vibrations and sometimes electric
discharges act irregularly ; and an occasional good shaking does the

the simple process of restoring the original galvanometer deflection
by adding or removing resistance coils.               A £-inch tube 8 inches
long of selected iron turnings, Fig. 18, had a resistance of 2500
ohms in the sensitive state.           A feeble stimulus, caused by a distant
electrophorus spark, brought it down 400 ohms. A rather stronger
one reduced it by 500 and 600, while a trace of spark given to a
point of the circuit itself, ran it down 1400 ohms.
      This is only to give an idea of the quantities.              I have not yet

any more than what the retina is doing.

of a theory of vision thus suggested is in accordance with some of
the principal views of the physiologist Hering.         The sensation of
light is due to the electrical stimulus ; the sensation of black is due
to the mechanical or tapping back stimulus.          Darkness is physio
logically not the mere cessation of light.       Both are positive sen
sations, and both stimuli are necessary ; for until the filings are
tapped back vision is persistent.       In the eye model the period of
mechanical tremor should be, say,          second, so as to give the right

      An electric bell thus close to the tube is, perhaps, not the best
vibrator     ;  clockwork might do better,            because the bell contains in
itself   a   jerky current, which produces            one effect, and a mechanical
vibration, which produces an opposite effect     hence the spot of light

the bell from actual contact with the board, the electric jerks of the
intermittent current drive the spot violently up the scale mechanical    ;

342                    Professor Oliver Lodge                   [June   1,
      A handy portable exciter of electric waves is one of the ordinary
hand    electric gas-lighters, containing a small revolving doubler,
i. e. an inductive or replenishing machine.        A coherer can feel a
gas-lighter   across a  lecture theatre.   Minchin  often used them for
stimulating his impulsion cells.     I find that when held near they act
a little even when no ordinary spark occurs, plainly because of the
little incipient sparks at the brushes or tinfoil contacts inside. A
Yoss machine acts similarly, giving a small deflection while working
up before it sparks.
     And notice here that our model eye has a well-defined range of
vision.    It cannot see waves too long for it. The powerful dis
turbance caused by the violent flashes of a Wimshurst or Voss
machine it is blind to.         Ifthe knobs of the machine are well
polished it will respond to some high harmonics, due to vibrations
in the terminal rods ; and these are the vibrations to which it
responds when excited simply by an induction coil. The coil
 should have knobs instead of points.        Sparks from points or dirty
 knobs hardly excite the coherer at all.       But hold a well-polished
 sphere or third knob between even the dirty knobs of a Voss
 machine, and the coherer responds at once to the surgings got up
in it.
    Feeble short sparks, again, are often more powerful exciters than
are strong long ones.   I suppose because they are more sudden.
    This is instructively shown with an electrophorus lid. Spark it
to a knuckle, and it does very little.      Spark it to a knob and it
works well.     But now try this experiment : — first spark it to an
insulated sphere, there is some effect ; discharge the sphere, and take
a second spark, without recharging the lid ; do this several times ;
and at last, when the spark is inaudible, invisible, and otherwise
imperceptible, the coherer some yards away responds more violently
than ever, and the spot of light rushes from the scale.
      Ifa coherer be attached by a side wire to the gas pipes, and an
electrophorus spark be given to either the gas pipes or the water
pipes, or even to the hot-water system in any other room of the
building, the coherer responds.
    In fact, when thus connected to gas-pipes one day when        I  tried
it,the spot of light could hardly keep still for five seconds. Whether
there was  a  distant thunderstorm, or whether     it  was only picking
up telegraphic jerks,I    do not know.      The jerk of turning on or
off an extra Swan lamp can affect        when sensitive.
                                         it              I     hope to try
for long-wave radiation from the sun, filtering out the ordinary
well known waves by         ablackboard or other sufficiently opaque
substance.
    We can easily see the detector respond to       a   distant source of
radiation now, viz. to 5-inch sphere placed in the library between
                       a
secondary coil knobs; separated from the receiver, therefore, by
several walls and some heavily gilded paper, as well as by 20 or 30
yards of space (Fig. 19).

     Also        I    exhibit              a small complete detector made                by my assistant,
Mr. Davies, which is quite portable and easily set up.      The essen
tials (battery, galvanometer and coherer) are all in a copper
cylinder three inches by two. A bit of wire a few inches long,
pegged into     helps     it,
                        to collect waves.   It just conceivable that
                                            it                                is
at some distant date, say by dint of inserting gold wires or powder in
the retina, we may be enabled to see waves which at present we are
blind to.
     Observe how simple the production and detection of Hertz waves
are now. An electrophorus or             frictional machine serves to excite
                                                         a

 to detect them.       Indeed, they might have been observed at the
beginning     of the century, before galvanometers were known. A
frog's leg  or an iodide of starch paper would do almost as well.
     A bad contact was at one time regarded as                 simple nuisance,     a
 because of the singularly uncertain and capricious character of the
current transmitted by it. Hughes observed its sensitiveness to
sound waves, and        became the microphone.

       Fitzgerald tells me that he has succeeded with carbon also. My experience
is  that the less oxidisable the metal, the more sensitive and also the more
troublesome      the detector.

copper lid on to a flange in six places was not enough. But by the
use of pads of tinfoil, chinks can be avoided, and the inside of the box
becomes then electrically dark.
    If   even an inch of the circuit protrudes, it at once becomes
                                    Fig.  20.
   Spherical Radiator for emitting a Horizontal Beam, arranged inside a
       Copper Hat, fixed against the outside of a metal-lined box. One-
       eighth natural size. The wires pass to the coil and battery inside
       the box through glass tubes not shown.
slightly sensitive again; and if a mere single wire protrudes through
the box, provided it is insulated where it passes through, the waves
will utilise it as a speaking tube, and run blithely in. And this
whether the wire be connected to anything inside or not, though it
acts more strongly when connected.
    In careful experiments, where tho galvanometer is protected in
one copper box and the coherer in another, the wires connecting the
two must be encased in a metal tube, Fig. 21, and this tube must be
well connected with the metal of both enclosures, if nothing is to get
in but what is wanted.
    Similarly, when definite radiation is desired, it is well to put the
radiator in a copper hat, open in only one direction (Fig. 20). And in

order to guard against reflected and collateral surgings running along
the wires which pass outside to the exciting coil and battery, as they are
                I
liable to do, am accustomed to put all these things in a packing case
lined with tinfoil, to the outside of which the sending hat is fixed,
and to pull the key of the primary exciting circuit by a striug from
outside.
     Even then, with the lid of the hat well clamped on, something
gets out, but it is not enough to cause serious disturbance of quali
tative results.     The sender must evidently be thought of as emitting
a momentary blaze of light which escapes through every chink.                  Or,
indeed, since the waves are some inches long, the difficulty of keeping
them out of an enclosure may be likened to the difficulty of excluding
sound ; though the difficulty is not quite so great as that, since a
reasonable thickness of metal is really opaque.                 I fancied once or
twice    I detected a trace of transparency in such metal sheets as
ordinary tinplate, but unnoticed chinks elsewhere may have deceived
me.     [Further investigation fails to detect real transparency even in
good tinfoil.]
     One thing in this connection is noticeable, and that is how little
radiation gets either in or out of a small round hole.              A narrow long
chink in the receiver box lets in a lot ; a round hole the size of a
shilling lets in hardly any, unless indeed a bit of insulated wire
protrudes through it like a collecting ear trumpet.
     It may be asked how the waves get out of the metal tube of an
electric gas-lighter.         But they do not ; they get out through the
handle, which being of ebonite is transparent.                Wrap up the handle
tightly in tinfoil, and a gas-lighter is powerless.
                              Optical Experiments.
     And now in conclusion         I   will show some of the ordinary optical
experiments      with   Hertz     waves,   using as source either one of two
devices ;   either  a  5-inch    sphere    with  sparks to ends of a diameter,
Fig.   19, an  arrangement      which    emits  7-inch   waves but of so dead-beat
a character    that  it  is  wise   to  enclose   it  in  a copper hat to prolong
them    and send   them     out  in  the   desired   direction ; or else a 2-inch
hollow cylinder with spark knobs at ends of an internal diameter,
Fig. 12. This last emits 3-inch waves of a very fairly persistent
character, but with nothing like the intensity of one of the outside
radiators.
     As receiver there is no need to use anything sensitive, so                  I
employ a glass tube full of coarse iron filings, put at the back of
a copper hat with its mouth turned well askew to the source, which
is put outside the door at a distance of some yards, so that only a
little direct radiation can reach the tube. Sometimes the tube is put
lengthways in the hat instead of crossways, which makes it less sen
sitive, and has also the advantage of doing away with the polarising,
or rather analysing, power of a crossway tube.
                                                                                   /

    The radiation from the sphere is still too strong, hut it can be
stopped down by a diaphragm plate with holes in it of varying size,
clamped on the sending box, Fig. 21.
     Having thus reduced the excursion of the spot of light to a foot or
so, a  metal plate is held as reflector, and at once the spot travels a
couple of yards.       A wet cloth reflects something, but a thin glass
plate,  if dry, reflects  next to nothing, being, as is well known, too
thin to give anything but " the black spot."            I  have fancied that it
reflects something of the 3-in. waves.

     A block of paraffin about a cubic foot in volume is cast into the
shape of a prism with angles 75°, 60°, and 45°.                   Using the large
angle, the rays are refracted into the receiving hat, Fig. 21, and
produce an effect much larger than when the prism is removed.
     An ordinary 9-in. glass lens is next placed near the source, and by
means of the light of a taper it is focussed between source and re
ceiver.    The lens is seen to increase the effect by concentrating the
electric radiation.
     The lens helps us to set correctly an 18-in. circular copper disc in
position for showing the bright diffraction spot. Removing the disc
the effect is much the same as when it was present ; in accordance
with the theory of Poisson.          Add the lens and the effect is greater.

With    a diffraction  grating of copper strips 2 in. broad and 2 in. apart,
 I have   not yet succeeded in getting good results.               It is difficult to
 get sharp nodes and interference effects with these sensitive detectors
 in a room.     I expect to do better when          I can try out of doors away
from so many reflecting surfaces ; indoors it is like trying delicate
 optical experiments in a small whitewashed chamber well supplied
 with looking-glasses; nor have             I  ever succeeded in getting clear
 concentration with this zone-plate having Newton's rings fixed to it
 in tinfoil.     But really there is nothing of much interest now in
 diffraction effects except the demonstration of the waves and the
 measure of their length. There was immense interest in Hertz's time,
 because then the wave character of the radiation had to be proved ;

348                           Professor Oliver Lodge                      [June  1,
but every possible kind of wave must give interference and diffraction
effects, and    their theory is, so to say, worked out. More interest
attaches to polarisation, double refraction and dispersion experi
ments.
     Polarisation experiments are easy enough.                Radiation from a
sphere is already strongly polarised, and the tube acts as a partial
analyser, responding much more vigorously                   when its length is
parallel to the line of sparks than when they are crossed ; but a
convenient extra polariser is a grid of wires something like what
was used by Hertz, only on a much smaller scale ; say an 18-in.
octagonal frame of copper strip with a harp of parallel copper wires
(see Fig. 21, on floor).        The spark-line of the radiator being set at
45°, a vertical grid placed over receiver reduces the deflection to
about one-half, and a crossed grid over the source reduces it to nearly
nothing.
     Rotating either grid a little, rapidly increases the effect, which
becomes a maximum when they are parallel.                   The interposition of
a third grid, with its wires at 45° between two crossed grids, restores
some of the obliterated effect.
     Radiation reflected from a grid is strongly polarised, of course, in
a plane normal to that of the radiation which gets through it.                They
are thus analogous in their effect to Nicols, or to a pile of plates.
      The electric vibrations which get through these grids are at right
angles to tho wires.        Vibrations parallel to the wires are reflected or
absorbed.
     To demonstrate that the so-called plane of polarisation of the
radiation transmitted by a grid is at right angles to the electric
vibration,* i. e. that when light is reflected from the boundary of a
transparent substance at the polarising angle the electric vibrations
of the reflected beam are perpendicular to the plane of reflection,               I
use the same paraffin prism as before ; but this time            I  use its largest
face as a reflector, and set it at something near the polarising angle.
When the line of wires of the grid over the mouth of the emitter
is parallel to the plane of incidence, in which case the electric
vibrations are perpendicular to the plane of incidence, plenty of
radiation is reflected by the paraffin face.            Turning the grid so that
the electric vibrations are in the plane of incidence, we find that the
paraffin surface set at the proper angle is able to reflect hardly
anything.       In other words, the vibrations contemplated by Fresnel
are the electric vibrations ; those dealt with by McCullagh are the
magnetic ones.
     Thus are some of the surmises of genius verified and made
obvious to the wayfaring man.

                   WEEKLY EVENING MEETING,
                             Friday, June   8, 1894.
          Sir Frederick Ared, Bart. K.C.B. D.C.L. LL.D. F.B.S.
                           Vice-President, in the Chair.
              C. Vernon Boys, Esq. F.B.S. A.R.S.M. M.R1.
                   The Newtonian Constant      of Gravitation.
  It  is probably within the knowledge of most of those present that Sir
  Isaac Newton, by his great discovery of gravitation and its laws, was
  able to show that a single principle, ideally simple, viz. that every
  particle in the universe attracts any other particle towards itself with
  a force which is proportional to the product of their masses divided
  by the square of the distance between them, would completely and
  absolutely account for the three laws of planetary motion which Kepler
 had given to the world.
      Newton also showed that a spherical body, whether uniformly
 dense or varying in density according to any law from the centre to
 the surface, would attract bodies outside with the same force that it
 would do if it could all be concentrated at its centre, i.e. that all the
 attractions varying in amount and direction produced by particles in
 all parts of a sphere need not be considered separately, but may be
 treated in this simple way.*
      Nevertheless, though Newton's great discovery is sufficient to bring
 the whole of the movements of the planets and of their satellites,
 whether their simple Keplerian motions or the disturbances produced
 by their mutual gravitation, the motions of comets, of binary stars, of
 the tides, or the falling apple, under the domain of a single and simple
 principle, though it enables one to compare the masses of the sun, the
 planets and their satellites, and of those binary stars whose parallax
has been determined, one thing can never be made known by astro
nomical research alone, though we may know that twenty-eight suns
would be required to make one Sirius ; that the sun is equal to 1048
Jupiters, that Jupiter is more than double all the rest of the solar
system put together, or that the moon is 1/80 of the earth ; no obser
vations of these bodies can ever tell us how many tons of matter go to
make up any one of them.
     Though we know from first principles of dynamics, by the mere
    * Only last night I learned that it was the difficulty of proving this, nnd
not the erroneous value of the moon's distance, that delayed the publication of
Newton's discovery for so long.

consideration of centrifugal force, that the whole sun attracts each ton
of the earth with a force equal to a weight here of a little more than
one pound, and that if it were not for this, every ton of the earth
would continue its journey into space in a straight line for ever, and
though we know in the same way that the whole earth attracts each
ton in the moon with a force equal to the weight of ten ounces and no
more, we cannot tell by any astronomical observation whatever how
many tons there are in all.
     Newton showed that to complete his law and to put in the numerical
constant (the Newtonian Constant of Gravitation) that would convert
his proportion into an equality, two methods are available : we may
either make observations on the disturbance of the earth's gravitation
by the action of isolated parts of it, we may either find the relative
attraction of an isolated mountain or the strata above the bottom of a
deep mine, or we may make an artificial planet of our own and find
the attraction which it exerts.
     The Newtonian Constant will be known if we know the force of
attraction between two bodies which we can completely measure and
weigh.    Employing the C. G. S. system of measurement, the New
tonian Constant is equal to the force of attraction in dynes between
two balls weighing a gramme each, with their centres one centimeter
apart.   Of course it may be referred to pounds and inches or tons
and yards, but as soon as all the quantities but G in Newton's
equation

                               ~~
                                      Distance2
are known, no matter in what units the quantities are measured, G is
known.    The conversion of its numerical value from one system of
measurement to another is of course a mere matter of arithmetic.
    Of the first method of finding G, depending on the attraction of a
mountain, first attempted by Bouguer at the risk of his life in the
hurricanes of snow on Chimborazo, of the experiments of Maskelyne,
of Airy and of others,   I cannot now find time to speak ;   I can only
refer to Poynting's essay on the subject.      It is the second method
                               I
with an artificial planet that have to describe to-night.
    Now let me give some idea of the minuteness of the effect that has
to be measured. Is a wall built true by the aid of a plumb-line
vertical, or does it lean outwards?      Newton's principle shows that
the plumb-bob is attracted by the wall, yet it hangs vertically.    The
attraction is so small that it cannot be detected in this way.     Even
the attraction of a whole mountain requires the most refined apparatus
to make its existence certain.    Do two marbles lying on a level table
rush together? According to Newton's principle they attract one
another ; yet if they were a thousand times smoother than they are,
no movement of attraction could be detected.
     Leaving matters of common experience, let us go into the physical
laboratory where instruments of the highest degree of precision and

 delicacy (at least so they are called) are found on every (able.        What
 precautions are taken to prevent the attractions of the fixed and moving
 parts from interfering with the result which they are constructed to
 measure ? None. The attractions are so small, that in no apparatus in
 use for the measurement of electrical, magnetic, thermal or other con
 stants are they ever thought of, or is any provision necessary to prevent
 their falsifying the result.    Nevertheless, the attractions exist, and if
 only the means are delicate enough they can be detected and measured.
 The Rev. John Mitchell was the first to devise a successful method.
 He was the first to invent the torsion balance with which Coulomb
 made his famous electrical researches, and which bears Coulomb's
 name. He devised and he made apparatus for this purpose, but he
 did not live to make any experiments.
     After his death Cavendish remodelled Mitchell's apparatus and
 performed the famous Cavendish experiment.            By means of the ap
 paratus, of which for the second time            I
                                             show a full-size model in this
 theatre, Cavendish measured the force of attraction between two
 balls of lead, one 12 and the other 2 inches in diameter, and with
 their centres 8*85 inches apart. The same experiment has since
 been made by Roitch, by Baily, and more recently by Cornu and
 Bailie with greatly superior apparatus of one quarter of the size.
 All these observers actually determined the attraction between masses
 which could be weighed and measured, and thus found with different
 degrees of accuracy the value of G.
     Let me explain now that this G, the gravitation constant, or as                           I
 prefer to call   it,
                    for the sake of distinction, the Newtonian Constant
 of Gravitation, has nothing to do with that other quantity generally
 written which represents the attraction at the earth's surface. This
             g,
is   apurely accidental quantity, which depends not only upon G, but
also upon the size of the earth, its mean density, the latitude, the
 height above the sea, and finally upon the configuration and the com
position of the neighbouring districts.            eminently of
                                                       g   is        practical    a
and useful character     ;   itthe delight of the engineer and the practical
                                  is

also be the mainspring of chemical action. Unlike any other known
physical influence,     it independent of medium,

356                           Mr. C. Vernon Boys                              [June 8,
     Owing to the universal character of the constant G, it seems to
me to be descending from          the sublime to the ridiculous to describe
the object of this experiment as finding the mass of the earth, or the
mean density of the earth, or, less accurately, the weight of the earth.
I  could not lecture here under the title that has always been chosen
in connection with this investigation.              In spite of the courteously
expressed desire of your distinguished and energetic secretary, that
I  should indicate in the title that, to put it vulgarly,                I  had been
weighing the earth,       I could not introduce as the object of my work
anything so casual as an'accidental property of an insignificant planet.
To the physicist this would be equivalent to leaving some great
international conference to attend to the affairs of a parish council.
That is the business of the geologist.             The object of this investiga
tion is to find the value of G.          The earth has no more to do with it
than the table has upon which the apparatus is supported.                           It
does interfere, and occasionally, by its attraction, breaks even the
quartz fibres that    I have used.       The investigation could be carried on
far more precisely and accurately on the moon, or on a minor planet,
such as Juno ; but as yet no means are available for getting there.
     I   shall not have time to-night to describe the work of former
investigators, and for this there is little need, since it is all collected
in Poynting's Adams prize essay, "On the Mean Density of the
Earth," published this year.          I  cannot even find time to explain in
more than the merest outline what               I   have done to develop the
apparatus of Cavendish, so that he would hardly recognise in my
glorified bottle-jack the balls and lever which have made his name
famous. The following table, given by Poynting, however, represents
the results of the labours of investigators up to the present time.
      In connection with this table         I cannot lose the opportunity of
quoting Newton's extraordinary prophecy, marvellous in that without
any direct knowledge he gave a figure which was nearer the truth
than that found by many of the experimenters that came after him.
 The    passage is as  follows  : —
      " Unde cum Terra communis suprema quasi duplo gravior sit
quam aqua, et paulo inferius in fodinis quasi triplo vel quadruplo
aut etiam quintuplo gravior reperiatur; verisimile est quod copia
 materiae totius in Terra quasi quintuplo vel sextuplo major sit quam
 si tota ex aqua constaret ; pnescrtim cum terrain quasi quintuplo
 densiorem esse quam Jovem jam ante ostensum sit." *
      I  have placed on the wall the diagram of the apparatus which                  I
 showed in action when lecturing here upon quartz fibres five years
 ago.                I
          With this was able, for the first time, to show to an audience
 the effect of the very small attraction exerted between a 2-inch
cylinder of lead and a little one weighing only a gramme or 15
 grains.     The apparatus which       I  have to describe to-night is the same
in prii «iple, the main distinction being that it is so designed and

measure so minute an effect ; instead of increasing this                         I   diminished
it enormously, being satisfied that                   I  should be able to make a pro
portionately more accurate measure by so doing.                           Cornu reduced the
dimensions to one-quarter ;                I   have     reduced     the   chief one to one-
eightieth.       Cavendish       had    a   force    equal   to   1/3650 grain's weight to
measure ;      I  have less than         a   five-millionth. By the use of the long
lever, Cavendish        had     the  effect    of a force of 1/100 grain's weight on
an  arm     an  inch  long ;     I  have     less   than a twelve-millionth of a grain
on an arm of that length.                  His    forces were fourteen hundred timea
as great as       mine    ;  his   couples        or   twisting forces were a hundred
and twenty        thousand       times     as   great. One advantage gained by the
use of small apparatus,             in    which      alone the attracting balls can be
made large compared              with    the    length of the beam, is the increased

sensibility, the greater angle of deflection produced by the attractions
when the period of oscillation is the same.      This is more especially
the case in my apparatus where the two sides are at different levels.
But the question arises whether this reduction of linear dimensions
may not introduce irregularity and want of stability to such an
extent as to more than counterbalance the advantages to which              I
have already referred. In spite of every endeavour that may be made
to keep the air quiet, to exclude draughts, to keep all the apparatus
at one temperature in a vault of constant temperature, infinitesimal
differences must exist ; one side of the apparatus must be hotter than
the other, though no thermometer could be made which would detect
the difference.    In consequence of this difference of temperature the
air circulates, and so creates a draught which blows upon the mirror
and the suspended balls.               I
                                 had erroneously come to the conclusion
that in apparatus geometrically similar these disturbances would
probably be in the proportion of the seventh power of the linear
dimensions, so that greatly increased stability would be obtained by
reducing the dimensions.      However,          I
                                            have discussed this matter with
Prof. Poynting, who has shown me that in reality the disturbances
would be proportional to the fifth power of the linear dimensions         if,
as should be the case, the circulation of the air were so extremely
slow that the motion would be steady, whereas              would gradually
                                                          it
rise from this to the eighth power as the term involving the square
if
i    the velocity increased in magnitude and the motion became
irregular. So long, therefore, as the apparatus            small enough to
                                                          is
prevent terms involving the square of the velocity from being appre
ciable, the stability   is  the same whatever the size, but as soon as
the apparatus exceeds this, then the disadvantage of size very rapidly
becomes evident.      In addition to this, the time needed to bring the
apparatus to a steady state        far greater with large apparatus. After

particular case), after which the couple falls off again and becomes

    Since the effect is a maximum at 65°, very great accuracy in the
measurement of this angle is of little consequence.            By means of a

maximum effect, and if the levels of the gold balls are not precisely
the same as those of the lead balls, again the departure is from a
position of maximum effect. All these three eccentricities can be
determined with an accuracy of 1/1000 inch.                          Errors of 1/100 inch
would make a barely perceptible effect upon tho result. The design,
therefore, is such that a great number of measures which are difficult,
and can at the best only be made with a second quality degree of
accuracy, are of so little consequence that this degree is more than
abundant.       The final result depends directly upon a few measures
which, as      I   hope to show, can be made with facility and most
accurately.       These are the horizontal distance from centre to centre
of the wires by which the lead balls are suspended, the horizontal
distance between the centres of the quartz fibres by which the gold
balls are suspended, the angle through which the mirror is deflected,
the masses of the lead but not of the gold balls, and the natural time
of oscillation of the mirror when the balls are suspended and when a
thin cylinder of small moment of inertia, but of the same weight as
the balls, is suspended axially in their stead.
     Before going more into detail and showing how the operations are
carried out so that all the quantities may be known with a sufficient
degree of accuracy, it will be convenient to project upon the screen
a drawing of the vault in which the experiments have been made.
Prof. Clifton has kindly allowed me the free use of the vault under
the Clarendon Laboratory at Oxford.                        This is shown in Fig. 2, of
which the upper portion represents                      an  elevation and the lower part
a plan.     The      instrument        itself     stands     upon the table Ai in the
corner, where        it  is  screened       from      temperature disturbances, which
my presence        in   the   distant    corner       and a very small flame produce,
by an octagon       house     of   double      wood      lined with cotton-wool, and by
double    felt  screens     fi  f2.     On    the   second    table A2 are placed a large
astronomical telescope           T,  through       which     the  large scale S is seen by
reflection   from     the  mirror     in  the   apparatus,      a small reading telescope
 t to read  the    angle     of  the   lid   and     vernier,   a  pulley-wheel pi and a
driving-wheel d.            The     pulley-wleel pl keeps the cord 6 which
 passes  round     p.,  and   p3,  and    is attached to the cart g, always tightly
 stretched, so that the observer at the telescope can always keep a
little flame carried by the cart immediately behind the particular
 division under observation.               The driving wheel d is made with a
very large     moment       of  inertia,    and the handle is near the axis, so that
 its motion     is  necessarily steady.              A very light cord passes round
this, across the room, and after passing through a hole in the screen
passes also round the little wheel D, Fig. 1, and thus serves to drive
the train W W, and so carry the lid and balls round almost in
sensibly.      Two hundred and thirty turns of d aro required to move
the lead    balls     from the + to the — position.                    I  generally turn the
handle a     hundred        and   thirty      times,     and   then   when    the mirror is
approaching        an   elongation,      turn      the   handle    the   remaining hundred
times, finally stopping          when    the    lid    reading,   as observed in the small

telescope, is correct.   The large scale S is 9 feet long, and is divided
into fiftieths of an inch. There are 4800 divisions.
     Two beams Zi 12 are seen in Fig. 2. The upper surfaces of these
are straight, and are adjusted by screws until they arc truly level.
These are used when the true optical distance from the mirror to the
scale is being measured. A steel tape, on which         I  engraved a fine
line near each end, rests upon the beams.     At one end a slider carry
ing a microscope is placed so as to see a fine line at the centre of the
mirror accurately in focus, while at the other a corresponding slider
is placed so that a projecting brass rod rests against the scale. At
the same time cross lines engraved upon the plate-glass bases are
placed exactly over the lines engraved on the steel tape. When
afterwards the microscope is focussed upon the end of the brass rod,
the distance between the cross lines, as measured by a scale, is the
amount that has to be added to the distance between the engraved
lines upon the tape, in order to obtain the distance from the scale to
the mirror.
     Overhead wheels are shown in Fig. 2, fastened to the roof above
the apparatus, and again close to the end wall. These serve many
purposes, as will appear later.    Among others, the middle one of each
carries a cord fastened at one end to a crossbar joined at its ends by
guys to the pillars It of the lid, Fig. 1, and at the other to heavy
balance weights to counterbalance the balls M M and part of the lid.
Thus the friction is greatly reduced, and the tremor set up by rotating
the lid is in a corresponding degree slight.
     All time observations are made chronographically upon a drum
by the Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company.         This is placed in
the adjoining vault.     Two time-markers record with their points less
than 1/100 inch apart, one of them marking every second of the clock
with special marks for minutes and half-minutes, and the other every
depression of the key at my right hand.        The late Prof. Pritchard
kindly lent me an astronomical clock for the purpose, to which           I
fitted time-marking contacts ; but into the details of these       I must
not enter.    He also allowed me to make use of one of his assistants
to keep me informed of the rate of the clock from time to time.
     I have up to the present spoken vaguely of the large lead balls
and of the small gold balls, but have given no indication as to how
they are made and how      I can be sure of the truth of their form and
their homogeneity.      Mr. Munro, whose capacity for turning accurate
spherical work is well known, made for me two moulds of hard cast
iron, which   I  have on the table. One of these is for a 4^-inch lead
ball, and one for a 2 j-inch lead ball. Each mould is made in two
halves, so truly as to shape and size that the thin steel disc that was
used as a template would distinctly rattle when in its place, but when
a strip of cigarette-paper was inserted on one side it could not be got
in at all. The upper half of each of these moulds is provided with a
cylindrical steel plunger accurately fitting a central hole in the mould,
and with its end turned to the same spherical surface when it is

1894.]                   on the Newtonian   Constant   of Gravitation.                  363
pressed home upon its shoulder.           The lower half of each mould has
a  J-inch   central  cylindrical   hole, into  which the lug of the brass ball
holder exactly fits. There is also a small hole at the side which can
be stopped with a brass plug.          The balls are made as follows : — The
interior of the mould is smoked and then screwed up as tight as
possible.     It is then heated until a piece of lead upon it begins to
melt.    The necessary quantity of pure lead melted in an earthen pot
is then carefully skimmed and poured in until the cylindrical neck is
full. The mould is then made to rest upon a cold iron slab, and a
large blowpipe flame is directed upon the upper part so that it cools
from below upwards, and not from the surface inwards ; more lead is
added to keep the neck full. As soon as the lead in the neck solidifies
the plunger is inserted, and the whole is placed in a hydraulic press.
The plunger is forced down upon its seat ; the lead, already free from
bubbles and vacuous cavities, is compressed until at last the excess of
solid metal flows through the small side hole in the form of wire.
The ball is thus made true in form, necessarily homogeneous, which
no alloy is likely to be, and definite in size.           When cold it can be
lifted from the mould, then, after cutting off the wire which projects
from its equator, it is ready for weighing.
      The small gold balls are made by melting the required quantity
of pure gold in a hole in a bath brick, and, as in the case of the lead,
letting it cool from below upwards, so as to avoid cavities.         It is then
inserted in a pair of polished hemispherical hardened steel dies, which
Mr. Colebrook made for the purpose, and beaten, being turned between
each blow, and annealed once or twice until a perfect polished sphere,
without a mark upon              it,

 possible, the optical definition should bo as perfect as possible, and,
 almost most important of all, the form should be such that the resist
 ance offered by the viscosity of the air should be reduced to the
 smallest possible degree. By cutting the middle portion out of an
 optically perfect round mirror all these conditions are realised in
 some degree, and the optical definition           actually more perfect in the

                                  happen,     and,    asI    know   by dearly-bought
                                  experience, the gold balls may sometimes
                                  be precipitated down the central tube.                I
                                  have recovered them sometimes by an india-

noously.    Sj is a micrometor scrow-head, which is employed to push
the scalo bodily to the right by measured amounts.                    The two micro
scopes are fooussed upon, say, the right sides of the wires, tho
focussing slide is then withdrawn, leaving them relatively unchanged,
and the microscopic scale is then put in its place.               Tho distance from
wire to wire is thus transferred directly to the scale, and the frac
tional part of any one division of 1/100 inch is all that has to bo
referred to and measured by tho screw.              Every slide in this apparatus
is geometrically arranged, so that tho movemonts are all perfectly
free, unconstrained and without shako.               In measuring the distance
between the fibres, which must bo done while they are freely sus
pended, so that a force of a millionth of the weight of a grain will
givo thorn a considerable motion, means have to be provided to
exclude draught, which yet must not interfere with the apparent
distances of the fibres. No microscope cover-glass is any use for this

purpose.    It is sure to be prismatic, and when inserted between the
microscope and an object it will certainly cause it to shift its ap
parent position.     A piece of clear mica is perfect in this respect, no
movement, even     with  a high power, being visible.              I  mention this as
it well illustrates the   sort  of  trap  that    is ovor   set  for   the experimen
talist.  If  I had   not   been  aware    of   this,  and  had    used,    as would be
natural, a window of microscope cover-glass,              then     each    fibre would
have appeared as definitely      in  its place    as before,   but   the  place would
have been wrong, perhaps by 1/1000             inch,  and  thus   a  consistent   error
affecting all the experiments      alike    would     have   been     introduced,  and
no multiplication     of  observations      or   taking   of    means     would   have
eliminated it. It is on this account that it is so important in experi
mental work to vary the conditions in every way, so as to discover
unsuspected consistent errors.
     The microscope scale was made by Zeiss, and is a most perfect
example of scale construction.         In order to test tho accuracy and find
the errors of tho   scale,  I took   ad vantage of my visit to Cardiff for tho

dust give great trouble, but was fortunate in having splendid weather
for my purpose, as visitors will probably remember: it rained without
ceasing during the two days    I was making these measurements.
    Having now very imperfectly described the apparatus and the
place in which  I have carried out my experiments,    I will next show a

series of photographs, which I took by magnesium light, to give a
better idea of the appearance of the apparatus and its surroundings.
Fig. 5 is a view of the vault showing the clock, the eye end of the
big telescope, and tho littlo telescope. In the distant corner is seen
the felt screen with a long slit, through which the scale and telescope
can be seen from the mirror of the instrument.       This, of course, is

on tho table behind the screen. Fig. 6' is a view of the corner itself,
with tho screen drawn back. The octagon protecting house, which
                                 Fic  7.
surrounds the apparatus, is seen in position.    Here again a slit is cut
largo enough to allow the    scale  and  telescope to be seen from the
mirror. Fig. 7 is a view   of  the instrument   with  tho two halves of

 the octagon house separated. Hero a further system of screens con
 sisting of concentric     brass tubes may be seen, but the lower one,
 which surrounds the window, has been removed and placed upon the
 table.   The driving gear is also seen in this photograph, and a pipe
 coming from the screw under the instrument which holds the central
 tube, which pipe is also seen in Fig. 1. This enables me to con
 trol the motion of the mirror from the telescope without approaching
 the corner in which the apparatus is set up. This is done as
 follows : the back window at the level of the mirror is made of metal,
 with a hole in it in which is screwed a metal tube lightly filled with
 cotton-wool.      This is not central, but opposite one end of the mirror.
 The pipe on the table does not fit the screw, but is merely bent up
 and enters it loosely.      By gently drawing air from the end of the
 pipe at the telescope a very feeble draught is produced in the appara
 tus, for nearly all the required air is supplied by leakage round the
 pipe near the screw, very little entering through the window tube, in
consequence of the resistance offered by the cotton-wool.        In this way,
 if tho mirror is moving it may be gently brought to rest without
impact, or it may be given a swing of any desired amplitude.               So
 perfectly does this work, that the mirror may be steadied very quickly
 so as to move through less than a scale division, an amount which
corresponds to six or seven seconds of arc, or to a force of less than
one thousand-millionth of tho weight of a grain.
     The operations for any complete experiment are fourteen in number.
I  do not intend to go through these seriatim, as time will not allow
me to do so.        It is sufficient now to say that the first eight are
 necessary to get the instrument and scale relatively fixed and ad
justed, the vertical measures made, and generally all ready for
operation 9, in which the optical compass is employed.             This is a
 most important one, for not only are the horizontal measures made,
 on which so much depends, but in addition the planes of the wires
 and fibres are made identical, the corresponding          scale reading is
 found, and any eccentricities    are measured  and  may be corrected.
     Fig. 8 is a view of the apparatus with the optical compass in
position, and with the microscopes focussed upon the wires.             They
are then ready to be withdrawn by the focussing slide, so as to
transfer the distances directly to the small glass scale, as already
described.
      When this is completed the proper windows are put in position,
the screen tubes, the octagon house and the felt screens are all
placed ready for operation 10, in which the deflections are measured,
and the period with the balls is determined.        As this is the operation
in which      variations  of  temperature produce so serious an effect,     I
prefer to   leave  everything undisturbed for three days, to quiet down.
A few hours     are  quite useless for the purpose.
     In operation 11 the period with the counter-weight in the place
of  the  gold balls is measured ; also the deflection, if any, duo to the
lid and lead balls upon the mirror alone. This is only 1/10 division,

but its existence is certain.  In the later operations the deflections,
if any, due to the lid alone on the mirror alone, and to the lid alone
on the mirror and gold balls, are separately determined.     Neither of
these can be detected. The actual elongation of the fibre may also
be observed at this stage, but this is of interest only as bearing on
the elastic properties of quartz fibres under longitudinal strain.

    Before  I come to the treatment of the observations,  I should like
to refer shortly to the kind of perfection of conditions which by the
employment of every practicable refinement that       I could devise, I
have succeeded in obtaining.     Taking experiment 8 as an example,
favourable in that the conditions were good, i. e. I was not badly dis
turbed by trains, wind, or earth tremors,    I give the worst and the

       Immediately after the oscillations of largo amplitude, which in
 this case at the end were rather badly disturbed by trains or other
 wise, a rather different deflection was observed, but not seriously
 different.     As examination of the figures shows only one anomalous
 point of rest immediately after the large amplitude disturbance,            I feel
justified in rejecting the only discordant figure, and in taking the
 mean of the rest as the true deflection.              The unit in this case is
 1/10    division.    It   corresponds to  an angular   movement of 1/280,000,
 i. e. about three-quarters of a second of arc.             Now a calculation of
 the angular twist due to a rotation of the air based upon the period,
the moment of inertia, and the logarithmic decrement, shows that if
the air in the tube were made to whirl round at the rate of one turn
in six weeks, so that the air would blow past the gold balls at the
rate of one inch in a fortnight, the deflection produced would be 1/10
division, an amount which is greater than the uncertainty of the
deflection on this particular night.             Again, an examination of the
points of rest through the night in the positive and in the negative
positions shows a very small steady creep, the same in each case.
Creepage of this sort has been,           I  believe, mentioned as a defect of
quartz fibres. When it gives trouble it is due to draughts, as already
explained, or to imperfect attachment of the fibres.!               In the present
instance the creepage observed corresponds to a surface rate of
movement on the fibre of a millionth of an inch a month.

      An examination of the mobile system of the      beam and suspended
gold balls, of which    I exhibit a greatly enlarged and working model,
at once shows that all the parts are capable of independent movement
to an apparently perplexing degree. This in the theory of the
instrument   I have treated provisionally as a rigid system, moving all
as one piece, which it certainly does not seem to be.         For instance,
the lead balls, by their attraction of the gold balls, pull them out of
the perpendicular, so that their distance from the axis is greater than
that given by measurement by the optical compass.               The error
amounts, in the case of the lower ball, when the lead is at its nearest
points to 1/10,000,000 inch, and         I
                                        have not taken any notice of it.
When the beam is oscillating through so great an angle as 100,000
units the centrifugal force only makes the gold ball move out four
times as much, and     Ihave taken no notice of that. Again, when the
mirror is under acceleration by the fibre, the gold balls, hanging
5 and 1 1 inches below, do not follow absolutely ; they must lag
behind, and so affect the period.           Now in this case the gold
balls are suspended in a manner which is dynamically equivalent
to their being at the end of a pendulum 5f miles long, the shortest
equivalent pendulum that has ever been employed in work of this
kind ; but short as it is,      Ihave not thought it worth while to be
perturbed by     an uncertainty of a fow inches.       There is one point
which in some of the experiments only has amounted to a quantity
        I
which do not like to ignore. It is due to the torsional mobility of
the separate fibres, about which each gold ball hangs, allowing them

in their rotation to slightly lag behind the mirror. As did not see
how to allow for      it,
                       I   applied to Prof. Greenhill, who immediately
told me what to do, and who, with Prof. Minchin, spent        a day or two
in the country, covering many sheets of paper with logarithms, in
finding and solving for me the resulting cubic equation.               The
correction on this account      is1/7850 on the stillness of the torsion
fibre.
     There are four remaining corrections depending on the fact that
besides the gravitating       spheres there are the ball-holders and
supporting   wires  and  fibres, all of which produce small but definite
disturbances in the gravitation.      These are all calculated and allowed
for.   They  are :—

I manage      to reserve Sunday nights, from midnight to six or eight in
 the morning, for observations of deflection and period.      All the other
 operations can be carried on in the daytime.           Sunday is the only
 night that is suitable, as the railway companies spend every other
 night shunting and making up trains about a mile away, and this
 causes such a continuous clatter and vibration, that hours of work
 may be lost.       A passing train does not seem so injurious; but,
 fortunately for me, most of the observations were made during the
 coal strike, and fewer trains than usual were running.           However,
 though  I   may escape from the rattling traffic of St. Giles by working
 at night, and on Sunday nights am not so badly affected by the trains,
I   am still not sure of quiet even when there is no wind.              For
 instance, at a quarter to four on Monday morning, Sept. 10, 1893,       I
 was recording chronographically the passage of every ten divisions.
 Everything was quite quiet, and at the particular moment the marks
 on the drum recurred at intervals of about three seconds. Suddenly
there was a violent non-vibrating         lurch of fifteen divisions, or
 150 units, which is enormously greater than anything that either
 trains or traffic could produce ; of course    I   could make no further
record.     The time of the last mark was, allowing for the known
error of the clock, 15h. 44m. 14 ' 3s. This was entered the same day
in my note-book as an earthquake, and in Tuesday's Standard         I  read
an account of a violent earthquake in Roumania at about the same
time. Mr. Charles Davison informs me that the shock was recorded
at Bucharest at 15h. 40m. 35s., but that the epicentrum must have
been some distance from there.      Exact particulars, it seems, cannot be
obtained.      Though it would appear that the rate of travel of the
shock is unusually high, there never was any doubt that what             I
observed was an earthquake, and it is practically certain that it was
the Roumanian earthquake.
     Owing to the viscosity of the air, which limits the time during
which an observation for period can be made to about 40 minutes,
on account of the resistance that the slowly moving mirror and gold
balls experience in their passage through      it,
                                               I      made one experiment
with view of reducing this difficulty, by the use of an atmosphere of
     a
pure dry hydrogen gas, which possesses     a    viscosity only half that of
air.I     found that on this account a  great advantage could be gained  ;
but this was more than counterbalanced by the difficulty of getting up
a  sufficient swing in the gas, and of efficiently controlling the mirror.
At the same time, think that if had had time to provide means for
                  I              I
feeding the gas into the tube without entering the corner, and at tho
same time were to prevent diffusion at the lower screw, that       a  littl
trouble in this direction would be well rewarded.        Meantime  I found
within the limits of error, which were greater than without the hydro
gen, that the deflection and the period corrected for the diminished
damping were the same.        The chief interest of this experime'
in the fact that it  revealed an action unknown to me, and     I bel
others, that a   thin plane glass mirror, silvered and larqueref¦

mirror was '844 gramme. In consequence of the small increase of
load the torsional rigidity of the fibre fell more than 4 per cent., an
amount far too great to be accounted for by the change of dimensions,
even if Poisson's ratio were as great as £. There is no doubt about
the great reduction in stiffness, for this figure is one of the factors in
the final expression for G, which does not show a change of more than
1 part in 1570.
       It will not be possible at this late hour to explain how the ob
servations are treated so as to obtain the value of G . It is sufficient
to state that in one of these clips all the observed deflections and
corrected periods are collected.           In the second all the geometrical
observations are collected and reduced, so as to obtain what          I  call the
geometrical factor, i.e. a number which, when multiplied by the un
known G, gives the torsion on the fibre. In the third, the moments
of inertia and periods are made use of to find the actual stiffness of
the fibre in the several experiments, and in the fourth these are com
bined so as to find G. From G the density of the earth A immediately
follows.
       The annexed table contains the important particulars of each ex
periment.        From this it will be seen that the lead balls were twisted
and interchanged in every way, so as to show any want of gravita
tional symmetry if it should exist. For instance, after experiment 7
the ball that was high was made low, the side that was outwards was
turned inwards, and their distance apart was reduced by 1/50 inch,
but the change in the result was less than 1 part in 2400. The experi
ments 7, 8, 9, 10 were made under widely different circumstances.
After experiment 8 the gold balls were changed for heavier gold
cylinders, which, as has already been stated, reduced the torsion of
the fibre nearly 5 per cent., but the result differs from that of experi
ment 7 by 1 part in 3700.           I  then broke the end of the torsion fibre.
 After keeping it in London three months             I broke the other end.     I
    then resoldered    each end and put the fibre back in its place, and
      aftermaking every observation afresh, found with the new shorter and
  0f ir fibre a result differing from that of experiment 8 by only 1 part
 to btPOO.        These four experiments were all made under favourable
  j  t33Q8tances, and on this account       I feel more able to rely upon them
         j  Y the  earlier ones,  which   were  subject to greater uncertainty.

376                           Mr. C. Vernon Boys                      [June  8,
The periods and deflections were taken in the first four hours after
midnight, then, after a few hours' sleep, and far too soon for the tem
perature to have quieted down,      I took the period with the counter
weight, but was only able to give ten minutes, as           I  had to catch a
train in order to be able to give my midday lecture at South Kensington.
It is not surprising that under such conditions a difference of 1 part
in 600 should arise. There is a difference of about the same order of
magnitude between the earlier experiments and the favourable four.
There is one point about the figures that        I  should like to mention.
No results were calculated till long after the completion of the last
experiment.           I
                Had known how the figures were coming out, it would
have been impossible to have been biassed in taking the periods and
deflections.    Even the calculating boys would not have been quick
enough to discover whether the observed elongations were such as
would give a definite point of rest.       I  made my observations, and
the figures were copied at once in ink into the books, where after
wards they left my hands and were ground out by the calculating
machine.     The agreement, such as it is, between my results is
therefore in no way the effect of bias, for       I  had no notion till last
May what they would be.
     My conclusion is that the force with which two spheres weighing
a gramme each, with their centres 1 centimeter apart, attract one
another, is 6 ¦6576 X 10~8 dynes, and that the mean density of the
earth is 5*5270 times that of water.          I   do not think the fourth
significant figure can bo more than one or, at the outside, two parts
in error.
                                I
     It is evident, from what have already said, that this work is of
more than one-man power.         Of necessity  I   am under obligations in
many quarters.      In the first place, the Department of Science and
Art have made it possible for me to carry out the experiment by
enabling me to make use of apparatus of my own design.                   This
belongs to the Science Museum, where       I hope in time to set it up so
that visitors who are interested may observe for themselves the gravi
tational attraction between small masses.           Prof. Clifton, as  I  have
 already stated, has given me undisturbed possession of his best ob
 serving room, his only good underground room, for the last four years.
 The late Prof. Pritchard lent me an astronomical clock.                 Prof.
 Viriamu Jones enabled me to calibrate the small glass scale on his
 Whitworth measuring machine ; and Mr. Chaney did the same for
 my weights.     I would specially refer to the pains that were taken by
 Mr. Pye, of the Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company, to carry
out every detail as     I wished it, and to the highly skilled work of
                            I
 Mr. Colebrook, to which have already referred. Finally, am under  I
 great obligations to Mr. Starling, of the Royal College of Science,
 who performed the necessarily tedious calculations.
     In conclusion,   I have only to say that while       I have during the
last five years steadily and persistently pursued this one object with
 the fixed determination to carry it through at any cost, in spite of any

opposition of circumstance, knowing that by my discovery of the
value of the quartz fibre, and my development of the design of this
apparatus,  Ihad, for the first time, made it possible to obtain the
value of Newton's Constant with a degree of accuracy as great as that
with which electrical and magnetic units are known ; though     have            I
up to the present   succeeded to an extent which is greater,   believe, I
than                         I
       was expected of me, am not yet entirely satisfied.        I
                                                          hope to make
one more effort this autumn, but the conditions under which       have          I
                             I
to work are too difficult ; cannot make the prolonged series of experi
ments in a spot remote from railways or human disturbance ;     cannot      I
escape from that perpetual command to come back to my work in

can only be made by my methods, but by some one more blest in this
world than myself.

                         Vice-President, in the Chair.

                      Mrs. Henriette Kellgren,
were elected Members of the Royal Institution.

Low Temperatures : —

      The    Chairman     reported    that   Mr. Ludwig Mond, F.R.S. had
made a proposal to the Managers             of the Royal Institution of Great
Britain, to convey to the Members of that Institution the freehold of
No. 20 Albemarle Street, to be held by them for the purpose of a
laboratory to be named
                              " The Davy-Faraday Research Laboratory of
the Royal Institution," and for the purpose of providing increased
accommodation for the Institution, and that the Managers, at their
Meeting held this day, had most cordially and gratefully accepted
this munificent gift made in the communication from Mr. Mond, of
which the following is an extract :—
     " In the year 1843 a proposal was made to establish at the Royal Institution
a   School of Practical Chemistry, which was not only to give practical and
systematic instruction to students, but was also to provide a place where original
researches could be conducted by individuals skilled in manipulation, and where
the professors could work out their problems by the aid of many qualified hands.
     " This proposal was submitted by the Managers of the Royal Institution to
Professors Faraday and Brande, who expressed their strong approval of the end
proposed, and their desire that it might be carried out at the Royal Institution,
' if it could be done well.'    But, on a closer examination of the limited space
within the walls of the Institution, it appeared impracticable to afford accommoda
tion for carrying out the proposed scheme.
     " In 1846 the Royal College of Chemistry was founded, and since that time
numerous schools for the teaching of practical chemistry have been established
all over the country. These, however, only cope with the first part of the
scheme recommended      in 1843, while as to the second part, viz. founding a
laboratory for the carrying out of independent researches, no adequate provision
exists in England up to this date, although the need for it was so strongly felt
so many years ago, and its importance for the advancement of science so forcibly
dwelt upon by the promoters of the scheme and by such men as Faraday and
Brande.
     "I  have felt that the need for such a laboratory has become greater and
greater since the work of the scientific investigator has become more and more
subtle and exact, and, in consequence, requires instruments of precision and a
variety of facilities which a private laboratory can only very rarely command ;
and surely this need exists nowhere to a greater extent than in England, and

1894.]                        General Monthly Meeting.                              379
nowhere can such a laboratory be expected to bear more abundant fruit than
in this country, which possesses such an unrivalled record of great scientific re
searches,      which have emanated     from private laboratories not 'connected     with
teaching institutions, and amongst which the laboratory of the Royul Institution
pt. hi. Is foremost, and has kept up its reputation for nearly a hundred years.
      " It has been my desire for many years to found a public laboratory which is
to give to the devotees of pure science, anxious and willing to follow in the
footsteps of the illustrious men who have built up the proud edifice of modern
science, the facilities necessary for research in chemistry, and more particularly
 in that branch of the science called physical chemistry.
      "I   have come to the same conclusion as the promoters of the scheme of 1843,
 viz. that such laboratory would still have the greatest prospect of success under
the aegis of the Royal Institution, that in fact it would be the consummation of
 the work which this great Institution has been fostering in its own laboratory,
 with such remarkable results, by the aid of the eminent men whose services it
 has always been fortunate enough to procure.
      "As only want of space prevented the Royal Institution undertaking this
task fifty years ago, I took the opportunity which offered itself last year of
acquiring the premises, No. 20 Albemarle Street, adjoining the Institution.
This property      I found very suitable for the purposes of such a laboratory, and
 large enough to afford, besides, facilities to the Royal Institution for a much
needed enlargement of its present laboratory and its libraries and reception
 rooms, which I should with great pleasure put at the disposal of the Institution.
      "•
         Being convinced that the Managers of tho Royal Institution will give all
the encouragement and aid in their power in the foundation and working of such
a research laboratory, I hereby offer to convey to the Royal Institution the free
 hold of No. 20 Albemarle Street, and also the lease     I hold from the Institution of
 premises contiguous thereto, to be held by them for the purpose of a laboratory,
to be named ' The Davy-Faraday Research Laboratory of tho Royal Institution,'
 and also for the purpose of providing increased accommodation          for the general
 purposes of the Royal Institution, as far as the available space will allow, after
 providing for the requirements of the research laboratory.
      " I also offer to make, at my own expense, all structural alterations
                                                                               necessary
 to fit the premises for these purposes, and to equip the Davy-Faraday Research
 I.al>oratury with the necessary apparatus, appliances, Ac, ami to make such further
 adequate provision as will hold the Royal Institution free from all expense in
 connection with the premises and the working of the said laboratory. . . .
      " I am aware that my offer will not provide for the third object of the scheme
 of 1843, viz. to enable the professors to work out their problems by the aid of
 many qualified hands ; but      I trust that if the laboratory which I offer to found
 proves successful, others will come forward who will supply the means for
 attaining this end, by the foundation of scholarships and bursaries to qualified
 persons willing to devote themselves to scientific work and not in a position to do
 so without assistance."

                     WEEKLY EVENING MEETING,
                           Friday, January     19, 1894.
         Sir Frederiok Bramwell, Bakt. D.C.L. LL.D. F.R.S.
           Honorary Secretary and Vice-President, in the Chair.
             Peofessor Dewar, M.A.           LL.D. F.R.S. M.R.I.
                          Scientific Uses  of Liquid Air.
When Faraday was working on liquid gases in this Institution
about 1823, with such means as were then at his command, his
inquiry was limited to the determination of the specific gravities
and vapour pressures of such bodies.              Twenty years later, by the
use of solid carbonic acid, the greatest cold then possible was
obtained, and Faraday made admirable use of Thilorier's                       new
cooling     agent    to extend    his  early  investigations.   Just   as  liquid
carbonic acid produced in glass tubes was of no use as an agent for
effecting the liquefaction of more resisting gaseous matters, until it
could be manipulated in the solid state, so liquid air, until it could
be handled, stored and used in open vessels, like any ordinary liquid,
could not be said to possess scientific uses in any wide sense.              Such
operations become easy when double-walled vacuum vessels (such
as were described in a former lecture) are employed in the conduct
of experiments where substances boiling at very low temperatures
 have to be manipulated.            The chief scientific use of liquid air
consists in the facilities it gives for the study of the properties of
matter at temperatures approaching the zero of absolute temperature.
 In this lecture the expression liquid air may mean either oxygen or
air.     Where a constant temperature is required oxygen is used.
 Liquid air made on the large scale may contain, after it is collected
in open vacuum vessels, as much as 50 per cent. of oxygen. Such
 a liquid boils between — 192° and — 182° C, and the longer it is
 stored the nearer it comes to — 182° C. or the boiling point of pure
 oxygen.     For a number of experiments of a qualitative character,
 whether it is liquid air or oxygen that is used makes no difference.
 In many of the experiments to be recorded, liquid oxygen made
 from the evaporation of liquid air was employed.                   In pursuing
 this subject in consort with Professor Fleming,* a long series of
experiments, involving the use of large supplies of liquid oxygen, have
been carried out on the electric resistance of metals and alloys, and
     * ' The Electrical Resistance of Metals and Alloys at Temperatures Approach
 ing the Absolute Zero.' By James Dewar, LL.D. F.K.S. and J. A. Fleming,

 London.    Phil. Mag. 1892.

894                              Professor Dewar                         [Jan.  19,
the results warrant the conclusion that at the zero of absolute tem
perature all the pure metals would be perfect conductors of elec
tricity. Under such conditions a current of electricity started in a
pure metallic circuit would develop no heat, and therefore undergo
no dissipation.     Similarly, we infer there would be no Peltier effect at
the zero. In other words, the passage of electricity from one metal
to another would take place without evolution or absorption of heat.
     Further investigation, along with Professor Liveing,* on the re
fractive index of liquid nitrogen and air, has led to the conclusion
that the refractive indices of nitrogen and air are respectively for
the D-ray, 1 ¦2053 and 1 ¦2062. In these determinations, instead of
using the prisms we have employed the method of Terguem and
Trannim, which consists in suspending in the liquid two plates of
glass with a thin layer of air between them, and measuring the
angle of incidence at which the chosen ray suffers total reflection at
the surface of the air.        As all the vacuum vessels are either spherical
or cylindrical in form when filled with liquid, they act as lenses
which are irregular and full of striations.             Further, small bubbles
of gas being given off in the liquid rendered any image indistinct
when viewed with a telescope.             In order to avoid the necessity of
observing any image through the liquid, it was used simply as a
lens to concentrate the light observed on the slit of a spectroscope.
Under such conditions the observations were easily executed and the
results satisfactory.
     For some time a series of observations on the thermal opacity of
liquid oxygen and nitrogen have been projected. It is, however,
exceedingly difficult to experiment in such a way as to eliminate the
absorbing action of the glass vessels, and as the use of rock salt is
impracticable, the absorption of heat of low refrangibility remains
for the present undetermined.           It is possible, however, to use the
glass vacuum vessels to determine approximately the relative thermal
transparency for heat of high refrangibility, such as is radiated by a
colza lamp.       The following results represent the heat transmitted
through the same vacuum vessels filled with different liquids, taking
chloroform as the unit for comparison and correcting for differences
of refractive index.

     From this result it follows that liquid oxygen is nearly as trans
parent to high temperature heat radiation as chloroform, which is
one of the most transparent liquids next to carbon bisulphide.
Liquid ethylene is much more opaque. These results must, however,
be considered only as an approximation to the truth, and as generally
confirmatory of the inferences Tyndall drew as to the relation
between gases and liquids as absorbents of radiant heat.

      Instead of silvering the interior and exterior of the vacuum
 vessels, it is found convenient when using mercury vacua to leave a
 little excess of liquid mercury, in order that the act of filling the
inner vessel with liquid air should cause a fine silvery deposit of the
metal over the exterior surface of the inner vessel.             In such a vessel
 liquid air or oxygen shows no signs of ebullition, the surface remains
 as quiet and still as if it was ordinary water.          The supply of heat is
 cut down to less than four per cent, of what it is without exhaustion
 and silvering in good vacuum vessels. The result is that volatile
 liquids can be kept thirty times longer.        Such vessels do not, however,
 maintain indefinitely the high standard of heat isolation they possess
 the first time they are used.       After repeated use all vacuum vessels
 employed in the storage and manipulation of liquid air deteriorate.
Illustrations of the appearance of such vessels are given in Figs. 1
and 2. The rapidity with which a space is saturated with mercury
vapour (which we know exerts a pressure of about one-millionth of an
 atmosphere) is easily proved by simply filling a barometer in the
usual way, and then instantly applying a sponge of liquid air to a
portion of the glass surface of the Torricellian vacuum space, when a
mercury mirror immediately deposits.             It is important to know the
amount of mercury deposited          from   a saturated    atmosphere which is
maintained (containing excess of liquid mercury) at the ordinary tem
perature, the condensation taking place when liquid air or oxygen
is discharged into a vessel surrounded by such a Torricellian vacuum.
If   the deposit on the cooled bulb is allowed to take place for a given
time, the outer vessel can then be broken and the amount of mercury
which coated the bulb ascertained by weighing.              Knowing the surface
of the cooled     bulb,   the  amount    deposited per      unit  of area can be
calculated.     In  this way  it was  found   that in ten  minutes  2 milligrams
of mercury per square      centimetre   of surface  was deposited. Considering
that one-tenth of a milligram of mercury in the form of saturated
vapour at the ordinary temperature corresponds to the volume of 1 litre,
this proves that the equivalent weight of 20 litres had been condensed
in the space of ten minutes. This plan of cooling a portion of the
surface of a vessel by the application of a liquid air sponge, enables us
to test our conclusions as to the amount of matter present in certain
vacua.     Here is a globe of the capacity of 1 litre. It has been filled
with, presumably, nothing but the vapour of mercury, by boiling under
exhaustion and subsequent removal of all excess of liquid.                Such a
flask ought   to  contain   mercury   in the  gaseous   state that  would  weigh
rather less than one-tenth of a milligram, assuming the ordinary
gaseous laws extend to pressures of less than one-millionth of an atmo
sphere. Now we know by electric deposition that one-tenth of a milli
gram of gold can be made to cover one square centimetre of surface
with a fine metallic deposit. Considering the general similarity in the
properties of mercury and gold, we should therefore anticipate that if
all the mercury vapour could be frozen out of the litre flask it would
also form a mirror about one square centimetre in area.                But after
one such mirror is deposited, the ronewed application of a second

liquid air sponge to another portion of the surface would cause no
visible deposit. This is exactly what takes place. If, however, two
spheres, one much larger than the other, are joined together by means
of a tube about 2 mill, in diameter and 50 mill, long, the whole
space being a Torricellian vacuum (with some excess of mercury)
then on decanting, the mercury may be transferred to the smaller
sphere, as is represented in Fig. 3. Now if an air sponge is applied
to a portion of the surface of the larger sphere, a mercury mirror
instantly deposits, but on applying a new air sponge to another
portion of the surface, no further mercury mirror is formed. The
narrow glass tube prevents the excess of liquid mercury in the
small bulb supplying vapour rapidly to the larger one, so that the
local cooling to —180° C. of a portion of the surface has practically
condensed all the mercury in the larger space, although the small
one is still filled with saturated vapour and a free communication
exists between them. If while in this condition the small bulb is
inclined so as to allow a drop of liquid mercury to fall into the lower
side of the large bulb, which has not been cooled, instant deposition
of mercury takes place on the liquid air cooled portion of the upper
surface.   Under very small pressure of vapour, therefore, equalisation
of pressure of two bulbs communicating by a narrow tube is a very
slow process.    There are cases, however, in which the application of
a sponge of liquid air to the surface of a vessel causes no visible
deposit, and yet the inference is that something has been condensed.
The best arrangement to show this effect is to select highly ex
hausted vacuum tubes containing phosphorescent materials like
alumina and other minerals, and to arrange the induction coil
spark gap of a little greater resistance than the vacuum tube. On
starting the coil the current passes solely by the vacnum tube, but
immediately the liquid air sponge cools a portion of the surface of
the bulb, the discharge shifts to the air gap. During the cooling the
phosphorescence of the glass tube is greatly increased, but finally the
resistance may become so great that all discharge in the vacuum tube
ceases.   Some old tubes belonging to the late Dr. de la Rue have
given visible deposits near the electrodes, and in many the diameter
and distribution of the striae are materially changed during the local
cooling to — 190° C.     When large vessels containing nothing but
mercury or iodine vapour as a residuum of the vacuum space are
rubbed with a cotton wool sponge of liquid air in a dark room,
luminous glows filling the vessel take place occasionally, or bright
flashes of light which enable the shape of the vessel to be seen.   The
ordinary mercury vacuum vessels show the same phenomena, which is
doubtless due to electric discharges caused by friction and cooling.
    The optical properties of bodies cooled to the temperature of
boiling liquid air will require long and patient investigation.      An
interesting fact easily observed is the marked change in colour of
various bodies. Thus, for instance, oxide, sulphide, iodide of mercury,
bichromate of potash, all become yellow or orange ; while nitrate of
uranium and the doublo chloride of platinum and ammonium become

 white.   Chromic acid, dilute solution of iodine in alcohol, strong
 solutions of ferric chloride and other coloured solutions becomo
 greatly changed. Such facts are sufficient to prove that the specific
 absorption of many substances undergoes great changes at the
 temperature of — 190° C.
      The tranquil atmosphere of air above the surface of the liquid in
 cylindrical or spherical vacuum vessels is a convenient place to cool
 very fragile bodies. During the slow ebullition of the fluid, gas
 between — 190° C. and — 180° C. is given off, which has three times
 the density of ordinary air, and which falls slowly over the mouth of
 the vessel in a heavy stream. On dipping into this atmosphere small
 soap bubbles, they contract rapidly and then freeze.       If a soap film
 is made on a circle of thin wire about 2 inches in diameter, and
allowed to stand until it shows the various orders of coloured bands,
and is then carefully dipped into the cool air, it freezes, showing all
 the original colours.    The black band is, however, always broken.
 Speaking of films, an interesting experiment may be made with a thin
stretched sheet of india-rubber, such as is used for making balloons.
 It is well known that stretched india-rubber contracts when heated
 and expands when cooled. Now this can be shown very easily by
 covering a glass funnel or the end of a cylindrical vessel with a
stretched sheet of rubber as thin as the walls of balloons.        Such a
surface is quite flat and fairly transparent.    If a sponge of liquid air
is drawn across the surface, the course is marked by a series of
wrinkles, due to the temporary expansion of the rubber caused by the
extreme cold.       The sheet of rubber being extremely thin, soon
regains the ordinary temperature, and the surface then is as flat and
tense as before.     During the continuous motion of the cotton wool
liquid air sponge over the rubber surface, it is followed by wave-liko
depressions which disappear almost as quickly as they are formed.
The elasticity of india-rubber, after cooling to — 182 0. and re
heating, seems unimpaired.
     Organic substances that only become solid at very low tempera
tures may be divided into two classes : those which crystallise, and
those which form glasses.       Thus bisulphide of carbon, tetrachloride
of carbon, methyl alcohol, hydride of amyl, all form crystals, whereas
ethyl alcohol, amyl alcohol, turpentine, ethyl nitrate, chinoline, pico-
lin, are glass-like. If a few drops of bisulphide of carbon are added
to alcohol and the mixture cooled to —180° C, a white solid emulsion
is formed, whereas the addition of tetrachloride of carbon to the
alcohol resulted in the production of a clear solid without any separa
tion. In the same way pure methyl alcohol crystallises easily, but the
addition of a few drops of ethyl alcohol prevents crystallisation and
causes a glass to be formed.       Thus the examination of the behaviour
of organic bodies at low temperatures may be a fruitful means of
organic investigation.
     For many purposes of investigation it is necessary to keep liquid air
without evaporation.      This is readily done by the use of two vacuum
test-tubes, fitting freely one inside tho other, arranged as in Fig. 4.

398                          Professor  Dewar                     [Jan.  19,
The smaller one is filled with liquid air, and after the insertion of
an   india-rubber stopper and glass tube, is completely immersed in
liquid air contained in the larger vacuum vessel.       In the figure the
tube A connects with the inner vacuum tube and B with the outer.
As the latter receives all the radiant and conducted heat, air is con
tinuously boiling off through the tube B, but as the supply of heat
is effectually cut off from the inner vacuum vessel, also containing
liquid air, no air distils through tube A. This is the most con
venient arrangement to use for the production of solid air.             For
this purpose B is connected with an air pump until the pressure
is reduced to about £ inch, and therefore the temperature about
 — 200° C.     Then a good air pump is put on to the inner vessel of
liquid air (containing oxygen and nitrogen in the normal proportion
of oxygen and nitrogen), by means of the tube A, while maintaining
constantly the exhaustion in the outer vessel.       In a short time the
air in the inner vessel solidifies to a transparent jelly-like mass.
      The same principle is used when the latent and specific heats
have to be determined.        Fig. 5 shows the general plan of the ap
paratus.    Now a definite quantity of heat has to be conveyed into the
inner vacuum vessel containing liquid air, with the object of finding
the weight of liquid that distils off, on the one hand, or the elevation
of temperature in the liquid that takes place on the other. For the
purpose of adding a given quantity of heat it is convenient in some
cases to use mercury (as represented in the figure), or to lower a piece
of platinum or silver, or even glass, into the inner vessel : each unit of
heat supplied evaporates a definite amount of air, which is readily
ascertained by collecting the gas which comes off during the heat
conveyance. In Fig. 5, A is the mercury, C the inner vessel of liquid
air, D a three-way stop-cock, F a tube for collecting the air given
off; E is a barometric tube for observing the pressure when the
inner vessel is exhausted. In a latent heat determination all that
is necessary is to weigh the mercury added and to measure the amount
of air by volume which has distilled from the liquid state.          If  the
 specific heat of the liquid is wanted, then the inner vessel is exhausted
(as well as the outer) through the tube F to about £ inch pressure,
and the three-way stop-cock turned so as to shut off F and connect
 the inner vessel with the manometer E. Mercury is now dropped
 into the inner vessel until the manometer rises to the atmospheric
 pressure or the liquid reaches its boiling point under atmospheric
 pressure.    Care must be taken to prevent the drops of mercury
 falling exactly in the same place, otherwise a mercury stalagmite
grows up rapidly through the liquid, vitiating the results.        Another
 objection to the use of mercury arises from the drops causing the
 rebound of small liquid air drops, which strike the cork and get
 evaporated away from the main body of liquid.            The amount of
 mercury added conveys the necessary amount of heat needed to
 raise the given amount of liquid from its boiling point under       J inch
 pressure to its boiling point under 30 inches. The relative pressures
 give the temperature range, and the weight of liquid air or other

gas under observation    is easily ascertained, together with the weight
of mercury added. In this way the latent heat of liquid oxygen at
          -            -
its boiling point is about 80 units, and the mean specific heat
between      198° and      182° is 0-39.
     Seeing that the most powerful chemical affinities are in abey
ance at very low temperatures, it is a matter of great interest
to ascertain what change comes over the physical force we name
cohesion.    Here we are dealing with the molecular forces which
are effective in uniting together the particles of solid bodies, in
contrast to the force we name chemical attraction, which exists most
characteristically between dissimilar molecules.       Both are alike in
this respect, that they are insensible at sensible distances.      If   we
accept the theory of matter which regards finite heterogeneousness of
the most homogeneous bodies as proved, then Lord Kelvin has shown
that gravitation alone would account for the so called cohesive forces.
Thus, he says (' Popular Lectures,' vol. i. page 60) : " But if we take
into account the heterogeneous distribution of density essential to
any molecular theory of matter, we readily see that it alone is sufficient
to intensify the force of gravitation between two bodies placed ex
tremely close to one another, or between two parts of one body, and
therefore that cohesion may be accounted for, without assuming any
other force than that of gravitation, or any other law than the
Newtonian."      Another view of the cohesive forces is taken by Mr. S.
Tolver Preston, in his work entitled ' Physics of the Ether,' page 64.
He says, " The phenomena of ' cohesion,' ' chemical union,' &c, or
the general phenomena of the aggregation of molecules, being de
pendent on the molecular vibrations as a physical cause, it would
therefore be reasonable to conclude that variation of vibrating
                         '
energy (variation of       temperature ') would have a most marked
influence on these phenomena, as is found to be the fact. Further,
since when a physical cause ceases to exist the effect also ceases, it
follows that at the absolute zero of temperature (absence of vibrat
                                               '
ing energy) the general phenomena of cohesion,' including the
aggregation of molecules in chemical union, would cease to exist."
If this theory is pressed so as to include the gaseous state, then at
the temperature of — 274° 0. wo may imagine the particles reduced
to an incoherent layer of dust or powder.      The experimental facts do
not, however, warrant this conclusion, seeing that at the lowest
temperature reached, which is about — 210° C, air remains a trans
parent jelly. That a low temperature causes profound changes in
the elastic constants of a metallic body is most easily shown by placing
a rod of fusible metal in liquid air, and comparing the deflection
produced by a weight when the rod is supported at one or both ends
before and after cooling.
     The Young modulus is increased to between four and five times its
amount at ordinary temperatures.         In the same way, the rigidity
modulus can be shown to bo greatly changed by cooling a spiral
spring made of fusible metal wire. Such a spring at the ordinary
temperature is quickly drawn out into a straight wire, by attempting

400                              Professor Dewar                         [Jan.  19,
to make it support an ounce weight.                 The same spiral, cooled to
— 182° 0., will support a couple of pounds, and will vibrate like a steel
spring so long as it is cool. In the same way, a bell or tuning fork of
fusible metal gives a distinct metallic ring at —180°.           If   two tuning-
forks are taken of identical pitch, and one cooled to — 182°, then
on simultaneouly striking them beats are very distinctly heard.                The
simplest plan of getting some idea of the change in the cohesive
force at low temperatures, is to ascertain the tenacity or breaking
stress of the metals and alloys under such conditions, and to compare
such results with similar experiments made at the ordinary tempera
ture with the same metallic samples, using the same apparatus.                  In
this way the comparative values are reliable. The only difficulty
is the large quantity of liquid air or oxygen required to cool the
steel supports of the wires, which have to be broken.                 Seeing that
wires less than ^ inch in diameter are unreliable, good strong rigid
steel supports are needed, and as those have to be cooled each time a
wire is broken, the experiments involve large quantities (gallons) of
liquid air and oxygen. Further, as not less than three, and in many
cases six experiments must be made with each sample of wire, and
the stress in each case can only be applied slowly, work of this kind
extends over long periods of time, and this means increased waste of
liquid gases.       Fig. 6 shows the general plan of the part of the
testing machine which supports the wires which have to be broken.
In the figure, A is the steel rod which is connected to the multiplying
levers, the stress being gradually increased as usual by running in
water into a vessel hung from the long end of the lever ; C is the
wire to be tested, B is an arrangement which measures roughly the
extension of the wire, and D is a large silvered vacuum vessel holding
the liquid oxygen. This latter vessel must be large, in order to avoid
any part of the supports of the wire coming into contact with the
sides, otherwise the shock of the wire on breaking shatters the
vacuum bulb.        The rupture must be made while the wire is immersed
in the liquid oxygen, and the whole of the supports thoroughly cooled
down.     The wires must be caught in long V-shaped grooves made in
the steel supports in order to avoid slipping, and change in the cross
section of the wire.          As a rule, the wires used were T\i- inch in
diameter    and   2   inches   long.     The following table gives tho mean
results of a large number of experiments : —

of strength is solely due to the low temperature, and persists only
during its continuance.          Wires that have been cooled to the tempera

portion being -fa inch diameter.               The spherical ends of the test
pieces   rested  in similar   cavities  made   in a special set of steel supports

 lead and solder.      The results with zinc, bismuth and antimony are
 exceptional, seeing they appear to be diminished in tenacity.                 This,
 however, may be only apparent, because the stresses set up in cooling
 such highly crystalline bodies probably weaken some set of cleavage
 planes so that rupture is then comparatively easy. In any case it must
 be admitted that no reliance can be placed on the tenacity of highly
crystalline metals. The breaking stress of mercury is interesting, and
turns out to be at — 182° C. nearly half that of lead at the ordinary
temperatures. The percentage elongation is not given in the foregoing
 tables, simply because the value of such measurements is of little
importance when such short pieces of the metals are under observa
tion. The general results of such observations are, however, inter
esting : thus, lead and tin at ordinary temperatures elongate before
 breaking about the same amount, whereas if tin is cooled to — 182° C.
 it hardly shows any extension, and lead under such conditions shows
no change, stretching as much at —182° as at 15° C. Solder and
fusible metal stretch less, and the cross section of the break is much
less at — 182° than at 15° C. The above experiments can only be
considered as preliminary to a more elaborate investigation of the
actual variation of the elastic constants at low tempjratures.               It will
require complex experimental arrangements to get reliable measure
                                                                                     /

 — 182° with the ratio of the rigidity modulus between the same
limits of temperature, has resulted in finding that both constants are
increased in the same proportion.      From this it would follow that
the resistance to compression of the substance at — 182° C. must
be increased in a similar ratio.       The comparative behaviour of
strong steel spirals at 15° C. and — 182° as to their elongation on the
repeated addition of the same load was a subject examined on several
occasions. The most careful comparison of such spirals, however,
revealed no measurable differences in their elongation between the
ordinary temperature and that of boiling oxygen.          This may be
due to the want of sufficient sensibility in the testing machine when
applied to such delicate experiments.     In the meantime it is reason
able to conclude that the rigidity modulus of very hard steel is not
much changed by cooling it to — 182° C.       If balls of iron, tin, lead
or ivory are cooled to —182° C. and dropped from a fixed height on
a massive iron anvil the elastic rebound is markedly increased in
all cases. The flat distortion surface produced on the lead sphere
after impact is only one-third the diameter of the circular surface
produced at the ordinary temperature when the lead ball falls from
  the same height.
      The examination of the magnetic condition of matter at low
 temperatures is a subject of great interest and offers a wide field for
 investigation.   In a former lecture the magnetic properties of liquid
 oxygen and air were discussed.          Owing to the experimental diffi
 culties, accurate quantitative measurements of the permeability have
 not yet been successful.        Faraday was the first experimenter who
examined the magnetic condition of matter at the lowest temperature
                                                  -
 that could be commanded in his time, viz. about 1 10° 0. He did not
succeed in making any substance which was non-magnetic at ordinary
temperatures assume the magnetic state at the lowest temperature of
the solid carbonic acid ether bath in vacuo. Later experimenters
have directed their attention more especially to the action of high
temperatures on magnetism, and the work of Professors Hopkinson
and Ewing in this field of research is well known.        Professor Trow
bridge examined the effect of a temperature of — 80° C. on a permanent
magnet, and came to the conclusion that the magnetic moment was
diminished by about 50 per cent. Professor Ewing found that an
increase of temperature of 150° C. above 10°, caused a reduction of
the magnetic moment of a bar magnet by about 40 per cent., and
that the magnet on cooling recovered its original state. This result
would lead us to expect that if the same law is followed below the
melting point of ice as Ewing found above         it,  thena   bar magnet
cooled   to —  182° O. ought  to  gain in magnetic moment   something like
30 to 50 per cent. The experiment of Professor Trowbridge         is,how
ever, apparently opposed to such an inference.       It appears, however,
that Professor Trowbridge cooled     a    magnet that had not reached a
constant state (that is   to say, one that on heating would not have
completely recovered its magnetisation on cooling), because after the
magnet had been cooled to — 80° on regaining the ordinary (tempera

 tore, it had lost 50 per cent, of its original magnetic moment.             Such a
 magnet would apparently diminish in magnetic moment on cooling
 and heating the first time the action was examined, but a repetition
 of the process when the action of magnetisation and temperature
 were strictly reversible might lead to an opposite conclusion.                    To
 settle this question a series of experiments on the magnetic moment
 of small magnets cooled to — 182 were carried out. Small magnets
 from half an inch to an inch in length were made of watch-spring or
 steel wire and were either used separately or in bundles ; they were
 fixed rigidly in a block of wood by means of copper staples, and in
 this condition were easily clamped firmly in the field of a magneto
 meter. The cooling was effected by applying a cotton-wool sponge
 of liquid air. The relative deviations of the magnetometer are
 proportional to the magnetic moment of the magnet under the
 respective conditions of + 15° and — 182° 0.              After the first cooling
 the magnet is allowed to regain the ordinary temperature, and the
 operation of cooling and heating is repeated three or four times.
 The following table gives some of the results, and these may be taken

      If  the experiment marked (1) is examined we find cooling to
 — 182°,   in the first cycle produced no change of magnetic moment, but
that on heating to +15° C. the magnet had lost 30 per cent, of the
original strength.        In the second cycle cooling increased the magnetic
strength of the magnet, in the condition in which it is left after the
first cooling by 33 per cent., and heating diminished it by 5 per cent. ;
whereas in the third cycle cooling showed 36 per cent, increase and
no loss in heating.          It was only after three alterations of tempera
tures from + 15° to           - 182° C. that the magnet reached a steady

condition.     In experiment (3) the first cooling shows a loss of
24 per cent., while in experiment (4) the first cooling shows a gain
of 12^ per cent.
     It is clear, therefore, that according to these experiments, every
magnet has individual characteristics that may either result in no
change on cooling or the addition or subtraction of from 12 to 24
per cent, in the magnetic strength.       All the experiments, however,
show that a repetition of the cycle of heating and cooling brings the
magnet to a steady state, in which cooling always causes increase in
the magnetic strength of from 30 to 50 per cent., and the re-heating
brings about no loss in the original magnetic moment.               Such a
marked alteration of magnetic strength might be used as a ther
mometer in low temperature research, and it is my intention to
extend the inquiry to the lowest temperature that can be reached by
the evaporation of nitrogen in vacua.         A simple mode of showing
the sudden alteration of magnetic strength on cooling, is to surround
a permanent magnet made up of a bundle of steel wires with a coil of
copper wire, leaving the ends of the magnet to project so that they
can be dipped in liquid air.       When the copper wires are attached to
a galvanometer, and one of the ends of the magnet cooled, an induced
electrical current occurs, due to the sudden magnetio change.
Accurate observations must be made on the permeability and sus
ceptibility of the magnetic metals at the temperature of boiling
liquid air, and the above results are an indirect guarantee that this
field of investigation will be fruitful in now scientific facts.
      This lecture has already covered a very wide field. It is easy
 to put into a Friday evening discourso the work of a year.       Members
 and friends have chiefly contributed to the Research Fund, which
 has enabled the Institution to extend the experimental plant needed
 for the prosecution of research in this field of inquiry, and they
 have strong claims to learn, in the first instance, the results of the
 general laboratory work.         My object has been to illustrate the
scientific uses of liquid air. To do this with any satisfaction requires
what may be called a good deal of scientific prospecting.         It is one
 thing to discover where the ore lies, it is another thing to produce
 the refined metal.    Investigations on the properties of matter at the
 temperature of boiling liquid air, must be in the first instance rather
 qualitative than rigidly quantitative.      In my opinion scientific pro
 gress is best served by conducting the inquiry on these lines.           It
 will be easy to refine later on.
     I  have to acknowledge the great assistance      I  have received in
 the conduct of these experiments, from my excellent chief assistant
 Mr. Robert Lennox, and         I must also express commendation of the
 way Mr. Heath has helped in the work.

                    WEEKLY EVENING MEETING.
                          Friday, January    25, 1895.
       Sir Douglas Galton, K.C.B. D.C.L. F.R.S. Vice-President,

                                     The Nile.
 I  aii to speak to yon to-night of the Nile, and      I think  I  may fairly
 say it is the most famous river in all the world : famous, through all
 the ages, for the civilisation that has existed on its banks ; famous for
 its mystic fabulous rise, about which so many sages and philosophers
 have pondered ; famous for its length, traversing one-fifth the distance
 from pole to pole ; famous, and apparently destined to be famous, for
 the political combinations that ever centre around it. But          I feel I
must begin by an apology, for now that Egypt has come so completely
within the tourist's range, probably many of my hearers have seen
more of the Nile than     I  have.
     If a foreigner were to lecture to his countrymen about the river
Thames, and were to begin by informing them that he had never been
above Greenwich, he might be looked upon as an impostor; and
perhaps    I  am not much better, for    I have never been higher up the
river than Philae, 610 miles above Cairo. For information regard
ing anything higher up,      I must go, like you, to the works of Speke,
Baker, Stanley and our other great explorers.            I  shall not, then,
detain you to-night with any elaborate account of this upper portion
of the river, but will only remind you briefly of that great inland sea,
the Victoria Nyanza — in extent only a little less than the American
Lake Superior —traversed by the equator, and fed by many rivers,
some of them taking their rise as far as 5° S. lat.            These rivers
form the true source of the Nile, the mystery only solved in the
present generation.
     The outlet of this great lake is on its north shore, where the river
rushes over the Ripon Falls, estimated by Speke at only 400 or 500
feet wide, and with a drop of 12 feet.       Thence the river's course is in
a north-west direction for 270 miles, to where it thunders over the
Murchison Falls, a cliff of 120 feet high. Soon after that it joins
the northern end of Baker's lake, the Albert Nyanza, but only to
leave it again, and to pursue its course through a great marshy land
for more than 600 miles, to where Bahr Gazelle joins it from the
west.     A little further down the great Saubat tributary comes in on
the east.     This is the region in which the river is obstructed by
islands of floating vegetation, which, if checked in their course, at

sadds, substantial enough to be used as bridges, and obstacles, of
course, to navigation, until they are cleared away. The waters of the
Saubat are of very light colour, and tinge the whole river, which,
above its junction, is green and unwholesome from the long chain of
marshes which it traverses.     Hence it is called the White Nile.         600
miles further brings us to Khartoum, where the Blue Nile from the
Abyssinian mountains joins        and at 200 miles still further to the

                     a
dry bed of the Atbara on June 22, 1861. The heat was intense, the
country was parched with drought.         During the night the cry went
forth that the floods were coming, and in the morning he found
himself on the banks of river, he says, 500 yards wide and from 15
                              a
to 20 feet deep.    All nature had sprung into life. A little north of

of its course its waters are diminished by evaporation, by absorption
and by irrigation.     The river gets less and less as        flows through

floods at the junction of the Atbara, and at other seasons at Khartoum,
1875 miles from the Mediterranean.
     The whole distance by river from the Victoria Nyanza to the sea
is about 3500 miles.     It may not be easy to derive any clear impres
sion from this bare recital of mileage. Let me try to convey to you
in some other ways the idea of the length of the Nile. Standing on
the bridge at Cairo,     Iused to reflect that   Iwas just about half-way
between the source of the Nile and the White Sea.               Or, to put  it
another way, if we could suppose        river crossing our English Chan
                                          a
nel, and that the Thames should find its way out in the Euphrates
and Persian Gulf, that river would be about as long as the Nile.
     In this short sketch of the course of the Nile, must not forget
                                                          I
to mention one interesting feature.      About 40 miles south of Cairo,
the low Libyan chain of hills which bounds the Nile valley on the
west  is broken by     gap, through which the waters of the river can
                         a
flow, and beyond this gap lies      saucer-shaped depression called the
                                      a
Fayiim, of about 400 square miles in area, sloping down to lake of a

   1895.]                        on The  Nile.                         407
   considerable size, the surface of whose waters stands about 130 feet
   below that of the sea. This lake is known as the Birket el Kurun.
       From the time of the earliest Egyptian records, this province of
   the Fayiim was famed for its fertility, and to the Egyptian taste for
   its delightful climate.   Many of the most precious monuments of
   antiquity have been found in the Fayiim. The famous Labyrinth is
   supposed to have stood just at its entrance ; and, what has excited
  most interest for the engineer in all times, it is here that Herodotus
  places that wonderful lake Moeris, which, receiving for half the year
  the surplus supply of the Nile, rendered it back again in irrigation to
  Lower Egypt during the other half. Where this lake actually was,
  has excited discussion since any attention has been paid to ancient
  Egyptian history. It seems pretty clear that in earlier days the
  Birket el Kurun was of much greater proportions than it is now, but
  how it ever could have been large enough to allow of its waters
  flowing back into the Nile valley when the river was low, without at
  the same time drowning the whole Fayum, is not very clear.
       Now, what are the functions of a great river, what are the offices
 which it renders to man ? And first of all, at least in this latitude,
 we would mention the carrying off to the ocean of the surplus water
 that descends from the skies. Nobly does the Nile fulfil this duty ;
 but with this enormous qualification, that it transports the water from
 tracts where there is too much, and carries it all free of cost, not to
 waste it in the sea, but to bestow it on tracts where it is of priceless
 value, more than taking the place of rain in watering the fields.
       The next function of a river is to form a highway through the
 land, and for most of its course the Nile fulfils this duty well, too.
 Gordon considered it possible for steamers to ascend the Nile, during
 the floods, from its mouth to the Fola rapids, a distance of about
 3040 miles ; but at other seasons, the six cataracts cannot be passed.
 Leaving out the 1100 miles which they occupy, there is an unbroken
 750 miles in the lower, and nearly 1200 miles in the upper river.       I
 cannot look on it as probable that it will ever pay to make navigable
 canals and locks round these cataracts, as it would entail so much
 hard rock-cutting.
      Another function of a river is to promote industry by the employ
ment of its water power.      We know how valuable is this power even
in England, and how much more in countries like Switzerland, where
it abounds, and on the great rivers of America. Excepting a few very
rude wooden wheels in the Fayum,        I  do not know, through all the
annals of the past, of a single water-wheel ever turned by the power
of the Nile. But that power exists to an almost unlimited extent.
And may we not prophesy that some day in the future, when that
long stretch of Nubian cataracts has fallen into civilised hands, and
when we know how to transmit electric energy with economy, that
then our descendants will draw wealth to Egypt from its chain of
barren cataracts?

of power, the Nile is great, but not so much so as many other rivers.
Its unique position is due to the benefit it confers on Egypt in turning
it from being a desert into being the richest of agricultural lands,
supporting with     ease a population of about six hundred to the square
mile.    Herodotus   truly said Egypt is the gift of the Nile. It more
than supplies the absence of rain, and this it does, first, by the
extraordinary regularity with which it rises and falls ; and secondly,
by the fertilising matter which the waters carry in suspension, and
 bestow upon the land.       Imagine what it would be to the English
farmer if he knew exactly when it would rain and when it would be
 sunshine.    When the Irrigation Department of Egypt is properly
administered, the Egyptian farmer possesses this certainty, and he
 has this further advantage, that it is not merely water that is poured
 over his lands, but, during nearly half the year, water charged with
 the finest manure.
      According to the early legend, the rise of the Nile is due to the
 tears shed by Isis over the tomb of Osiris, and the texts on the
 Pyramids allude to the night every year on which these tear-drops
 fall. The worship of Isis and Osiris has long passed away, but to
 this day every native of Egypt knows the Lailet en Nuktah, the night
 in which a miraculous drop falls into the river, and causes it to rise.
 It is the night of June 17. Herodotus makes no allusion to this
 legend of Osiris. In his time, he says, the Greeks gave three reasons
 for the river's rise. He believed in none of them, but considered as
 the most ridiculous of all that which ascribed the floods to the melting
 of snows, as if there could possibly be snows in such a hot region.
 It was many centuries after Herodotus' time when the snowy
 mountains of Central Africa were discovered.
      The heavy rains commence in the basin of the White Nile during
 April, and first slowly drive down upon Egypt the green stagnant
 waters of that marshy region.       These appear at Cairo about June 15.
 About a fortnight later the real flood begins, for the rains have set in
  in Abyssinia by May 15, and the Blue Nile brings down from the
  mountains its supply of the richest muddy water. It is something of
  the colour and nearly of the consistency of chocolate, and the rise is
  very rapid, as much sometimes as 3 feet per diem, for the Atbara
  torrent, having saturated its great sandy bed, is now in full flood also.
  The maximum flood is reached at Assouan about September 1, and it
  would reach Cairo some four days later, were it not that during
  August and September the water is being diverted on to the land, and
  the whole Nile valley becomes a great lake.        For this reason the
  maximum arrives at Cairo about the beginning of October.             The
  rains cease in Abyssinia about the middle of September, and the
  floods of the Blue Nile and Atbara rapidly decrease ; but in the
  meantime the great lakes and marshes are replenished in the upper
  regions, and slowly give off their supplies, on which the river subsists,
  until the following June. Yearly this phenomenon presents itself in
  Egypt, and with the most marvellous regularity. A late rise is not

more than about three weeks later than an early rise.         In average
years the height of the flood at Assouan is about 25J. feet above the
minimum supply.      If it rises 29 feet above this minimum, it means
peril to the whole of Egypt, and the irrigation engineer has a hard
time of it for two months.     If the river only rises 20 feet above the
minimum, it means that whole tracts of the valley will never be sub
merged. Such a poor flood has happened only once in modern times,
in 1877, and the result was more serious than the devastation caused
by the most violent excess.
     The mean flood-discharge at Cairo is about 280,000 cubic feet per
second, the maximum about 400,000.        The mean lowest Nile is about
 14,000 cubic feet per second at Cairo, but some years there is not
more than 10,000 cubic feet per second passing Cairo in June, and
within three months after this may have increased fortyfold.
     Until this century, the irrigation of Egypt only employed the
flood-water of the river, and it was this that made it the granary of
the world.    No doubt rude machines for raising Nile water were used
at all seasons and from all times.      But by these it was not possible
to irrigate on a large scale, and in reality they were only employed
for irrigating vegetables or gardens, or other small patches of land.
     It must not be thought that the water of the flooded river is ever
allowed to flow where it lists over the lands.      The general slope of
the valley on each side is away from the river, a feature which the
Nile shares with all Deltaic streams.      Along each edge of the river,
and following its course, is an earthen embankment, high enough not
to be topped by the highest flood.       In Upper Egypt, the valley of
which seldom exceeds six miles in width, a series of embankments
have been thrown up, abutting on their inner ends against those
along the river's edge, and on their outer ends on the ascending sides
of the valley. The whole country is thus divided into a series of
oblongs, surrounded by embankments on three sides, and by the slope
of the desert hills on the fourth.   In Lower Egypt, where in ancient
days there were several branches of the river, this system was some
what modified, but was in principle the same. These oblong areas
vary in extent from 60,000 to 3000 or 4000 acres, and the slope being
away from the river, it is easy to cut short, deep canals in the banks,
which fill as the flood rises, and carry the precious mud-charged
water into these great flats, or, as they are termed, basins of irriga
tion. There the water remains for a month or more, some 3 or 4 feet
deep, depositing its mud, and then at the end of the floxl it may
either be run off direct into the receding river, or, more usually,
passed off through sluices from one basin to another, and ultimately
back into the river. In November the waters have passed off, and
wherever a man and a pair of bullocks can walk over the mud, and
scratch its surface with a wooden plough or even the branch of a
tree, wheat or barley is sown ; and so saturated is the soil that the
grain sprouts and ripens in April or May without a drop of rain or
any fresh irrigation.    And a fine crop is reaped. Ono of our threat

410                       Sir Colin Scott-Moncrieff                 [Jan. 25,
brewers told me the other day, that when barley grown in this country
was spread in the malting-nouse, about 3 per cent. of it must be
counted on as not sprouting and being dead.           If grain two or three
years old was used, as much as 20 per cent would be found dead.
With Egyptian barley, he said, even after several years, you could count
on every grain germinating.       The crop once reaped, the fields remain
 dry, and crack in the fierce summer heat until next flood comes on.
      The tourist who only comes to Egypt to shun " winter and foul
 weather," knows nothing of the majestic glories of the Nile flood.
 The ancient Nilometer at the south end of the island of Roda, just
above Cairo, is one of the most interesting sights of the place.         The
 water enters from the river by a culvert into a well about 18 feet
square, with a graduated stone pillar in the centre.        On each side of
the well is a recess about 6 feet wide and 3 feet deep, surmounted by
a pointed arch, over which is carved in relief a Kufic inscription, and
a similar inscription is carried all round the well, consisting of verses
of the Koran. A staircase goes down the well, from the steps of
which the initiated may read the height of the water on the pillar ;
but they are few in number, and the hereditary Sheikh of the
Nilometer, whose duty it is to keep the record, is a person of some
importance.      The Nilometer dates from a.d. 861, and         I believe in
the archives of Cairo may be found the daily record for 1000 years.
     I  need hardly tell you that when our English engineers took the
river in hand, we established a number of gauges at Wadi Haifa,
Assouan, Cairo, and many other points, on more scientific principles
than the venerable Nilometer of the Roda Island.
     After the river has begun to rise, its height is daily chanted through
the Cairo streets until it reaches 16 cubits on the gauge. At this
point the Khalig el Masri, the old canal that flows through the heart
of Cairo, is opened. Up to this point it is dry ; and, full or empty, it is
little more than a sanitary abomination at present ; but in former days
it occupied an important place, and when the Nile water was high
enough to flow down its bed, it was looked on that the flood had fairly
set in, and that the kindly fruits of the earth might be duly expected.
     The head of this canal is on the right bank of the river, just south
of Cairo.    The water enters a channel some 30 feet wide, with a high
wall on its left, and a sloping bank on its right or southern flank. The
water then flows under the pointed arch of an old stone bridge.          The
bed of the canal is cleared so that it would flow in at a gauge of about
14J cubits, but an earthen bank is thrown across it about 4 feet higher.
     There is no more interesting ceremony in Egypt than the annual
cutting of the Khalig, as the opening ceremony is called. It takes
place between August 5 and 15.        Days before, preparations are being
made for the festival.       Tents with innumerable lamps are placed
along the wall on the one side ; frames for all manner of fireworks
are erected on the sand-banks on the other side.         All the notables aro
there in full uniform, or in canonicals — the Khedive himself, or his
representative, the Sheikh ul Islam (the highest dignitary of the

  1895.]                         on The Nile.                         411
  Muhammedan faith), the Sheikh el Bekri, the Sheikh es Sadat, all the
 learned scribes of the great university of the Azhar, the cabinet
 ministers and under-secretaries, the sirder of the army and his staff,
 the judges and the financiers.
      The Egyptian troops are turned out, salutes are fired, and about
 eight o'clock in the warm summer night the classes all assemble
 under the gaily-lighted tents, the masses crowd round the frames for
 the fireworks, the street is lined with harem carriages full of closely-
 veiled figures, though it is not much that they can see from their
 broughams.     Out in the river, just opposite the canal's mouth, is
 moored an old hulk of a certain sea-going outline, which has been
 towed up from Boulak during the day, and is an emblem of the time
 when the great republic of Venice sent an envoy to witness the cere
mony.     This boat is full of lamps, and fireworks too. As the night
deepens the excitement increases. The populace on the bridge and
the opposite bank are shouting, yelling and dancing wildly round the
fireworks.     On the other side are the gay uniforms and lighted tents,
from whence we can look over the wall down on the dark water, where
you see brown figures plunging in, and, waist-deep, digging with their
 hoes at the embankment that blocks the canal's mouth.
     Long before midnight the fireworks have gone out, and left the
splendid stars to themselves ; the grandees have all gone to bed, but
the people keep up the revelry, and in the morning, by 7 . 30, every
one has come back.      Then but little of the bank is left uncut ; a few
more strokes of the big hoes will do it, and the brown skins and the
brown water reflect the bright sunlight from above.            Then the
Sheikh ul Islam solemnly thanks the Almighty, Allah the All-
powerful, the All-merciful.      He implores His blessing on the flood,
and at a signal the bank is cut, the waters rush in, and with them a
crowd of swimmers. A bag of silver piastres is scattered among them,
and the ceremony is at an end.
     There is a pretty legend, worth telling, of the cutting of the
Khalig.     Amr, the Muhammedan general, took Cairo in a.m. 610.
Long    before then there had been a heathen ceremony, and a virgin
was yearly sacrificed to the god of the river.    When the season came
round, Amr was called upon as usual to sacrifice the girl.            He
sternly refused. That year the Nile flood was a failure.        You can
fancy how the indignant heathen population must have raged at the
invader, and said, " We warned you what would happen if you didn't
propitiate the river god."      Cannot we fancy, also, how Amr's wild
Arab soldiers must have had their faith sorely tried, and how they
must have felt puzzled as to whether in this strange new country,
with all those demon-built temples and pyramids, obelisks and
sphinxes, it might not be as well to make friends of the local gods.
Could Allah really help them here? Again the Nile flood came
round.     This time surely Amr would sacrifice the girl, and save the
land ? No ; he would not. The people rose up in rebellion.           Amr
stood firm.    But he wrote to the Kalif Omar for orders (Omar,     whose

412                   Sir Colin Scott-Moncrieff                      [Jan. 25,
name you will remember has come down in history as the destroyer
of the Alexandrian library). Omar approved of his conduct, but sent
him a paper to throw into the Nile. On the paper was written,
" From Abd Allah Omar, Prince of the Faithful, to the Nile of
Egypt. If thou flow of thine own accord, flow not ; but if it be
Allah, the one the mighty, who causeth thee to flow, then we implore
him to make thee flow."     Amr threw the paper into the water, and
the Nile rose forthwith exactly as it was wanted.     Since that day no
girl has been sacrificed ; but a pillar of earth is yearly left to be
washed away in the middle of the canal, called the bride or the girl.
    Such, as  I have briefly described       it,
                                           was the irrigation of Egypt
until this century, when  it fell under the rule of Muhammed Ali,             a
very sagacious and strong, if  a very unscrupulous ruler.   He saw that
the country could produce far more valuable crops than cereals. The
European market could be supplied with these from the fields of
Europe, but Europe could not produce cotton and sugar-cane.      Egypt
had the climate, had the soil, had the teeming population      but these
                                                                 ;
crops required water at all seasons      nor would
                                         ;              do to flood the
                                                            it
fields to any depth, for just at the flood season the cotton crop             is
ripening.    There was plenty of water in the river but how was
                                                            ;         to it
be got on to the land ?    Perennial irrigation was     fresh departure.

As have said, the Nile rises about 25£ feet. A canal, then, running
 I
12 feet deep in flood has its bed 13^ feet above the surface of the Low
Nile. Either the Nile water had to be raised, or the beds of the
canals had to be lowered, in order that one should flow into the other,
and after that the water had to be raised from the canal on to the
land.   Muhammed Ali began by lowering the canal beds of Lower
Egypt, an enormous work considering the great number of the canals            ;
and as they had been laid out on no scientific principles, but merely
to suit the fancies of Turkish pashas or village sheikhs, and as those
who had to excavate them to this great depth had only the slightest
knowledge of levelling, the inevitable result followed — the deep
channel became full of mud during the flood, and all the excavation
had to be done over again. Incredible as           may seem, this great
                                                       it
work was done year after year. It was          great serf population
                                                   a                   if;
they were not fighting Muhammed Ali's battles in Arabia and Syria,
they might as well be digging out the canals. No one thought of
paying or feeding the workmen.       The bastinado was freely applied
if they attempted to run away.      If
                                     they died under the labour, there
were plenty more to come.      But of course the work was badly done.
The water might enter the canal; but, as the bed was not truly
levelled,it  did not follow that    would flow far.
                                   it                 Then, as the river
daily fell, the water in the canals fell too, and lessened in volume as
the heat increased, and more was required.           At last — in June,
perhaps  — the canal was dry, and the cotton crop that had been sown
and watered, weeded and nurtured, since March, was lost altogether.
     Then some one advised Muhammed Ali to throw a dam across the
river, and so raise the water, and the result was the great Barrage.

1895.]                         on The   Nile.                         413
     About twelve miles north of Cairo the Nile bifurcates, and finds
its way to the sea, by the Rosetta and Damietta branches. Across
the heads of these two branches were built two stone bridges, one of
71, the other of 61 arches, each 5 metres or 16*4 feet span.     These
arches were intended to be fitted with gates ; by lowering which, all
the water would be dammed up, and diverted into three great trunk
canals, taken out of the river just above these bridges.     One to the
right or east of the Damietta branch was to supply water to all the
provinces of the eastern delta ; one between the two bridges was to
supply the splendidly fertile central delta ; the third, to the left or
west of the Rosetta branch, was to water all the western delta down
to Alexandria.
     There was no intention of water storage at the Barrage, but it was
merely with the object of controlling the supply.     While there was
water enough in the river, by closing the gates it could be kept to a
uniform level, and sent down the three trunk canals, from which it
was to branch, into many minor ones.     As the river went down, gate
after gate would be closed, and so a constant supply could be kept in
the canals. The idea was thoroughly sound. The execution was feeble.
     Mougel Bey, the French engineer in charge of the work, had no
doubt many difficulties to contend with.   The work went fitfully on
for many years, thousands of men being forced to it one year, and
carried off to a campaign the next. But at last it was sufficiently
finished to allow of an opening ceremonial in 1861. Gates had been
fitted into the Rosetta branch arches, never into the Damietta.
     The central canal had been dug in tolerably satisfactory style.
The western canal, too, had been dug, but passing through a strip of
desert it had become very much filled up with sand. The eastern
canal was dug some five miles, and then stopped. Of course the
Barrage without these canals was useless. However, they began to
experiment with     it,closing the gates on the Rosetta side. It was
intended to hold up 4£ metres, or 14 feet inches of water. It never
                                                9
held up  5 feet, till in 1867, it cracked across from top to bottom, on
the Western side.        An immense coffer- dam was built round the
cracked portion, and the water was never held up again more than
about 3£ feet, while the work was looked on as      a  deplorable failure.
In 1883, all hope of making anything out of the Barrage was
abandoned, and the Government were on the point of concluding a
contract with  a   company to supply Lower Egypt with irrigation by
means of an immense system of steam pumps, to cost 700,000Z. to
begin with, and 250.000Z.  a   year afterwards.
    That year there was wretched serf army of 85,000 men working
                          a
at canal clearances for 160 days, unfed, unpaid.        The burden was
nearly intolerable.    The irrigation was all by fits and starts. There
was no drainage every hollow became sour and water-logged.
                ;                                                   With
waterways everywhere, there was no navigation.          In Upper Egypt
things were better, as the system was      a simpler one.    But when we
came to look into them, too, we found great abuse, and on an average

414                     Sir Colin Scott-Moncrieff              [Jan.   25,
about 40,000 acres never succeeded in obtaining water, though in the
midst of abundance.
     The Fayum had long been a much-neglected province, though a
most picturesque and attractive one.      From carelessly allowing Nile
water to flow into the lake during the floods, it had risen enough to
swamp 10,000 acres of valuable land, and this mischief we found
still increasing. Throughout the whole country drainage had been
absolutely neglected.      And here    Iwould point out that irrigation
without drainage means the sure deterioration of the land sooner or
later.   Considerable pains have been taken in Egypt to get the water
on to the land.    No sort of effort had been made to get it off. In a
properly irrigated tract, between every two canals of supply, there
should flow a drainage channel ; the former should follow as far as
possible the highest lands, the latter should follow the lowest.     The
canal gets smaller, till at last it is exhausted, giving itself out in
innumerable branches.       The drain, like a river, gets larger as it
proceeds, being constantly joined by branches.       But if there be no
drains, and if the canals are laid out to flow into one another, so as
to divide the country into, as it were, a cluster of islands, you can
understand how the drainage water has no means of flowing off into
the sea, and settles in unwholesome swamps. These we found pre
vailing to an alarming extent in the rich provinces of the delta.
Such was the wretched state of Egyptian agriculture — the one single
source of the country's wealth — when Lord Dufferin laid down the
lines of the English administration, which have been amplified and
pursued ever since.
                               I
    It was in May 1883 that took charge of the irrigation depart
ment in Egypt, having before then had some twenty years' experience
of similar work in India ; and     Isoon had the inestimable advantage
of being joined by a band of the most indefatigable, energetic and
able engineers, also from India, with whom it was my great privilege
and happiness to be associated for the next nine years.        I  cannot
talk too highly of these my colleagues — men who knew their work
and did it, who kept constantly moving about in the provinces, badly
lodged, badly fed, denied domestic comforts, constantly absent from
their wives and families (they were all married men).
    My friends, happy   is  the reformer who finds things so bad that
he cannot make      a   movement without making an improvement.
Happy the reformer who has as colleagues            staff of thoroughly
                                                    a
loyal, duty-doing and capable men. Happy the reformer who is not
pestered on all sides by the officious advice of the ignorant.    Happy
the reformer who has behind him        strong brave chief, as honest and
                                       a
truthful as he is  strong.   Such rare happiness fell to me in Egypt
with my noble colleagues, and with Lord Cromer as our chief.
    On first arrival,   I  was pressed, both by English and French
men, to go into the question of the storage of the flood waters

it would be time enough to think of increasing the quantity of

1895.]                        on The   Nile.                          415
water at our disposal when we had profitably used all that
we already had, and while mighty volumes were daily flowing
out to the sea, it could not be said that we were doing that. The
first great work to be studied was the Barrage.      We were warned on
all sides to have nothing to say to it, as it was thoroughly unsound ;
but we felt sure we must either make it sound or build an entirely
new one, and we resolved on the former.            The work had failed
because it was faulty in design, the floorings and foundations not
being sufficiently massive, and faulty in execution from the dishonest
use of bad materials and from bad workmanship.            The bed of the
river consists of nothing more stable than sand and alluvial mud for
at least 200 feet deep. It was out of the question to think of getting
down to solid rock.     It was not, as we thought, very safe to excavate
very deeply close to the existing works, so we decided not to try it,
but merely to strengthen and consolidate the foundations, built as
they were on sand.    I   have said that the work consisted of two great
bridges over the two branches of the river. We could not shut up
either branch entirely ; but we decided to strengthen and complete
one-half of each bridge each season, which meant four seasons' work.
While the river was still in considerable flood each November, we
began to throw out great embankments of earth about 200 feet from
the bridge ; one up-stream, the other down-stream of       it, beginning
at the short end, and ultimately enclosing one-half of the river as in
a  pond.    This used to take three months' hard work. Then we
pumped the water out of this enclosure, and laid bare the very bed
of the river. Then we laid     a    massive stone flooring, 5j^feet thick,
extending 100 feet up-stream, and as much down-stream, of the
bridge.    This was very difficult and hard work. It was kept going
day and night, without intermission, from March till the end of June.
Then we cut great holes in our embankment, cleared out our
machinery, and prepared for the arrival of the flood at the beginning
of July.     Each year one-half of one bridge was finished, and the
whole was completed at the end of June 1890.
     In connection with the Barrage were completed the three great
canals to carry off all the river supply from above it.           So that
practically now the Low Nile    is  emptied every season at the Barrage
and diverted into these canals, and no water at all escapes to the sea.
The natives wade everywhere across the river north of this point.
Since it  was completed, the Barrage has given no trouble.       It holds
up every year     4metres, or 13 feet of water.  The three trunk canals
were all supplied with locks 160 feet by 28 feet, and adapted for
navigation.    The whole of these works cost about 800.000Z.         The
annual increase of the cotton crop, compared to what      it  was before
1884,     never less than two and a-half millions sterling, which has
         is
not been     bad investment for Egypt.
              a
     Turning to Upper Egypt, my colleague, Colonel Ross, directed
his attention very closely to the adjustment of canals overlapping
one another, passing under and passing over one another     ;  so that in

416                      Sir Colin Scott-Moncrieff               [Jan. 25,
future    I
         trust that with the feeblest Nile flood it will be possible to
pour water over every acre of the land.
    The question of drainage was very thoroughly taken up. Twelve
years ago it may be said that there were no drainage channels in
Egypt.     Two years ago there were about 1000 miles of such
channels, some with beds as wide as 60 feet and flowing deep enough
to carry cargo boats, others with beds only 3 or 4 feet wide.       amI
glad to say by these means large tracts in Lower Egypt which had
been abandoned as totally ruined, have now been restored to cultiva
tion.  The level of the lake in the Fayum was reduced by 13 feet
between 1885 and 1893, and most of the inundated lands around it
have been again dried.
      I have already mentioned the cruel hardship of the corvee, the
serf army of 85,000 men who were employed in the canal clearances
from January to July, nearly half the year.     I believe this institution
was as old as the Pharaohs, and it was not easy to abolish it. But
of course it went sorely against our British grain. Little by little we
got money to enable us to pay our labour.        By an annual outlay of
400,000Z. this spring corvee has entirely ceased since 1889, and now
the Egyptian labourer carries out these clearances in as free a manner
as his brother in Middlesex, and gets paid for his work.
     Having thus, to the best of our powers, utilised the water in the
river flowing past us, we turned our attention to the storage of the
surplus waters.      Without some such storage it is impossible to
increase the cultivation during the Low Nile.      All the water is used
up.     During High Nile there is always a great volume escaping
useless to the sea.
     There are two ways in which the water may be stored ; either by
throwing a dam right across the river and forming a great lake above
it, or,    such
          if   a  place can be found, by diverting the flood water into
some suitable hollow, and drawing      it off from there at the season of
low supply, as done by Herodotus' celebrated Lake Moeris. At one
time there was hope that such
                a                  a storage basin might be found.      An
American gentleman, named Mr. Cope Whitehouse, in search of the
real Mceris, found   a  very remarkable saucer-shaped depression just
south of the Fayum.        We knew     it could not have been Moeris,
because in its bed we found no traces of    a deposit of Nilotic mud, but
it might be possible all the same to utilise it. The place was very
carefully surveyed, and the project was estimated but;      it  was found
that the cost of conveying the water into this basin would be so great
that  it was out of the question.
     Attention was then turned to the possible sites where stone dam
                                                            a
might be built right across the river.        The southern boundary of
Egypt just now      isnear Wady Haifa, tho second cataract.       It no
                                                                      is
use going to look for sites south of this, for the country       is in the
 hands of the Mahdi and his fierce dervish soldiers.        North of this
 point, unquestionably the best site — perhaps the only possible site —    is
where the Nile valley    is traversed by    abroad dyke of hard Syenito

1895.]                              on The Nile.                               417
granite, in passing over which the river forms its first cataract just
south of Assouan.         It is here divided into several channels between
rocky islands, and no channel is deep, so that it would be easy to
divert the water from one after another, to lay bare the bed of the
river, and lay the foundations of the dam in the open air.                It wants
no engineer to understand what an advantage this is.
     And the great dam, such as was designed by Mr. Willcocks,
would have been a work worthy of the land of the Pyramids and
Earnak — a great wall of squared granite blocks — 82 feet thick at
base, of a maximum height of 115 feet, 1£ miles long, pierced by
sluices large enough to allow of the whole Nile at highest flood
rushing through. The lake formed would have been 120 miles long.
Would this not have been a work of some majesty to commemorate
for ever the English rule in Egypt — a work one would have been
proud to have had a hand in ? But it was not to be. The Egyptian
saw no objection to it. The money could have been found.                       But
there was an insuperable obstacle created when, on the Island of
Philse, about 250 B.C., Ptolemy II. built a temple to Isis, on the site
of older buildings long disappeared.                 Round this temple other
buildings clustered, built by Greeks and Romans.                Those of you who
have not seen them, are probably familiar from pictures with the
group of venerable buildings standing amidst palm trees on the rocky
island, and reflected in the waters below.
     Had Ptolemy only built his temple on the island of Elephantine,
a few miles north, it would have been unaffected by the great dam,
but Philiu is just to the south, or up-stream side of where the great
dam must necessarily have come, and in consequence the island, with
its temples, would be drowned for about six months every year.
You probably remember the outburst of rage and indignation which
the announcement of this proposed desecration created in London
last summer.        It was not to be tolerated that England should commit
such vandalism.         In vain it was answered that the place belonged to
Egypt,    not  to  England — that the Egyptian, who was to gain so much
by the dam, cared absolutely nothing about Ptolemy and his temples —
that he was prepared to pay a largo price for a great work to bene
fit his country.       What business was it of England to forbid him ?
      And it was not only the English who were indignant. For once,
and only for once,          I  fear, since we occupied Egypt in 1882, was
educated opinion in England and France at one.                 Both alike insisted
 that Philio should not be drowned.             Nor must     I  admit had all the
engineers     that   were    interested   in the   question   the  full courage of
their opinions.        While    they longed    to  build  the   dam, and lamented
the perverse fate that had put Philaa           there, still they wished to spare
 Pliilte — and their voice has prevailed.            The majestic structure has
been cut down 27 feet, and now will only be 88 feet high, and Philaa
will stand honceforth in a lake, but will never be drowned.
      Personally     I accept the situation, for       I  never believed that it
 would bo sacrificed.         But yet as an engineer,       I  must sigh over tho

418                Sir Colin Scotl-Moncrieff   on The   Nile.         [Jan.  25,
lost opportunity      for England of making such a splendid reservoir.
And    as a  friend to Egypt, I sigh still more that the country will not
have such a splendid supply of water as would enable Upper Egypt
to have the full benefits now possessed by Lower Egypt, and Lower
Egypt to expand and flourish.
     The reduced scheme will, however, be a great boon to the country,
and   I trust will now be put in hand without delay.
     In   1884, when the expedition up the Nile was first being con
sidered,    I  was asked by the general officer commanding in Egypt,
whether     I thought there was any possibility of the Mahdi diverting
the river in the Soudan, and depriving Egypt of its water.                  The
late Sir Samuel Baker was in Cairo at the time, and           I consulted him
as to whether he knew of any place in the Nile valley where during
highest flood the water spills off to the right or left, towards the Red
Sea or the Libyan Desert.          He said he was sure there was no such
place, and then      I  told the general it would be impossible for the
Mahdi to divert the Nile.        I was sure that with his savages he would
never dam up the low supply until its surface attained the height of
flood supply, and if even then during flood there was no spill channel,
Egypt was safe enough.
     But what the Mahdi could not do, a civilised people could do.
A government official has no business to talk politics, and the Royal
Institution is no place for politics ; but       I  may be allowed to point
out an evident enough fact, that the civilised possessor of the Upper
Nile valley holds Egypt in his grasp.
     At this moment the Italians are on the eastern edge of that valley
               I
—a nation, must say, who have been consistently most friendly to us
in Egypt. Supposing that they occupied Khartoum, the first thing
they would naturally and very properly do would be to spread the
waters of the Low Nile over the Soudan ; and no nation in Europe
understands irrigation so well.          And what then would become of
Egypt's     cotton  crops  ?   They  could  only be secured by a series of
the most costly dams over the river, and the fate of Philw would
surely be sealed.        But more than this: a civilised nation on the
Upper     Nile   would   surely build regulating sluices across the outlet
of the Victoria Nyanza, and control that great sea as Manchester con
trols Thirlmere. This would probably be an easy operation. Once
done, the Nile supply would be in their hands ; and if poor little Egypt
 had the bad luck to be at war with this people on the upper waters,
 they might flood them, or cut off their water supply at their pleasure,
 that iv-jt not evident, then, that the Nile from the Victoria Nyanza
     Att Mediterranean should be under one rule?                That time is
 might heir off.      I  conclude   what  I have   to say to-night by giving
 Egypt jus-iurance, and      I challenge contradiction, that at no time in
 use going istory of Egypt under Pharaoh or Ptolemy, Roman or
 hands of thrk, have the people of the country been so prosperous, or
 point, unqwjd as during the last nine years.

                     Friday Afternoon, February      1, 1895.
  Sib James Cbiohton-Bbowne,            M.D. LL.D. F.K.S. Treasurer       and
                          Vice- President, in the Chair.

                                 Acting : an Art.
  My immediate purpose is not bo much to deal with the existing
  classification of the Fine Arts as to add to the recognised number
  one other, the Art of Acting — that art which Voltaire spoke of as
  " the most beautiful, the most difficult, the most rare." The claim
        I
  that make is purely a technical one, for tho thing itself has long
  ago been done.        The great bulk of thinking — and unthinking —
  people accept Acting as one of the Arts ; it is merely for a formal
  and official recognition of the fact that I ask.          The people, who
 are the students of life, have learned their lesson, and perhaps the
 professors should now learn it also.           In the face of the widespread
 influence     of the  stage of  to-day  and  its place in the thoughts and
 hearts of tho people, it     would   seem   about  as necessary to vindicate
 acting as an art as it would be to justify the existence of the air
 we breathe or the sunshine which makes life joyous ; but when
 we find that up to now the records are deficient, we should,         I think,
 endeavour to have them completed.              Even so widely sympathetic
 a writer as Taine by inference excludes acting when he speaks of
 " the five great arts of poetry, sculpture, painting, architecture, and
           "
 music ; and sometimes lesser minds than his use the general
 omission to classify acting as amongst the higher organized efforts
 of man, as a means of perpetually assailing this particular craft and
 those who follow it ; recalling an eccentric and intolerant time, when
 it was said against Shakespeare that he had never been to Court,
and against Molii-re's memory that his body had been denied full
 Christian burial. Official recognition of anything worthy is a good,
or at least a useful thing. It is a part, and an important part, of
 the economy of the State ; if it is not, of what use are titles and
distinctions, names, ribbons, badges, offices, in fact all the titular
and sumptuary ways of distinction ? Systems and courts, titles and
offices, have all their part in a complex and organised civilisation,
and no man and no calling is particularly pleased at being compelled
to remain outside a closed door.
      Acting is a part of human nature. It is originally nature's own
method of education in the earliest stages ; and its purposeful organi
sation is like that of any other organisation — an Art. Out of their
heightening civilisation tho Greeks, evolved and formulated a drama,

 completelj different word to express the originator of ideas — the
 word creator, or maker —the poet, as we call him to this day. The
 functions of these two, the poet and the artist, are entirely different,
 and their work can be dissociated.             Homer, the poet, conceived
 his thoughts and gave them utterance, but the fashion in which he
 moulded them in giving them birth was the work of art. When
 others disclaimed his verses so as to give forth their mighty roll and
 rhythm, the fashion of their speech was the work of art. When,
 later on, the sculptors modelled the forms of the gods and heroes,
 as Homer described them, translating the thoughts of the poet into
 graceful form, whose inner significance men could understand, this
 was the work of the artist too. It was no detraction from the merit
 of the work as work of art, that the sculptor set forth Homer's ideas
 and not his own.      Nay, more, when a sculptor, when Homer's name
 was a great tradition, gave forth what appeared to be his image, was
 this less a work of art because it professed to represent a real man,
 and not a creation of the sculptor's mind ?
     What, then, is it which is in common with poetry, music, sculp
 ture, painting? — It is the knowledge of the powers of nature, and
 the systematisation     of them in such a way that effects may be
 recurrent as required. Hear Alexander Pope on the subject : —
                 " These Bales of old discoverM not devis'd,
                   Are Nature still, but Nature methodiz'd ;
                   Nature, like Liberty, is but restrain'd
                   By the same laws which first herself ordain 'd."
 And again: —
                 • AB Nature is but Art   unknown to thee."
     If  we, then, broadly define art as the systematisation of natural
                                                           " fine " as
 powers, wherein may we find the limitation of                          applied to
 the arts? M. Taine, in his exhaustive treatise on The Philosophy
                        "
 of Art, says that if we succeed in defining Nature, and in marking
 the conditions of existence of each art, we then possess a complete
 explanation of the Fine Arts, and of art in general, that is to say,
a philosophy of the Fine Arts — what is called an tathetic system"."
 And he goes on to say that this aesthetic system — the science of the
 beautiful — " imposes no precepts, but ascertains and verifies laws."
 . . . That she
                    " has sympathies for every form of art." . . . That
"she accepts them as so many manifestations of human intelligence."
He then proceeds:—" It is plain that a statue is meant to imitate
accurately an animated human form, that a picture is intended to
portray real persons in real attitudes, house interiors and landscape,
such as nature provides.           It is no less evident that a drama or
romance attempts to represent faithfully characters, actions, and
conversations, and to furnish as vivid and as accurate impressions of
them as is possible."
     He thus sums up his examination of the nature of a work of
art : — " We have discovered a loftier aim for art, which thus becomes
the work of intelligence, and no longer merely that of hand."

      Here,  then, we get some idea of that which constitutes a work of
 art as a   work of " fine " art — intelligence on the part of the artist.
 Whereas     the object of art generally and broadly is to imitate, to
conform     to a model, the object of fine art is to compose or select
 intelligently, to exercise that selective faculty which the Professor
goes on to show is a higher function of nature as well as of man.
 And thus far it cannot be denied that acting, which certainly requires
 intelligence, still remains in the category of the Arts as thus limited.
      But there is a fuller limitation set forth by M. Taine.      It is not
 enough that the work imitate nature faithfully, and that the imitation
 be selective for particular purposes, and intelligent.       It must not
 be content with faithfulness     as to detail — it must grasp essential
 character.     " In Nature," he says, " essential character is simply
 dominant ; it is the aim of art to render it predominant.       It moulds
 real objects, but it does not mould them completely. . . . Man is
 sensible of this deficiency, and to remove it he has invented art."
      Surely this truth in Acting needs no defence ! Nay, in the prac
 tice of the art it has at times grown to be an evil ; for exaggeration
 of a type of good or evil — of passion — of emotion of any kind, has
 to be purposely avoided by judicious players, who realise that the
 expression of emotion must be complex, though it be dominated by
one phase. Shakespeare, speaking in Hamlet's voice, himself pointed
out the evil : — " In the very torrent, tempest, and, as       I  may say,
whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that
may give it smoothness."      And thus far acting keeps well within the
bounds of art as fixed.
      But there is a still further limitation, for M. Taine, in leaving
 the work of art to consider the artist, says : — " There is one gift
indispensable to all artists. . . . If it is wanting in them, they are
nothing but copyists and mechanics.            In confronting objects the
 artist must experience original sensation; the character of objects
strikes him powerfully, and the result must be a strong, deep, personal
impression."
     " Look," says Polonius of the player, " look whether he has not
 turned his colour, and has tears in's eyes." Surely that which was
taken by Shakespeare as typical of the poor Player of Wittenberg
may be allowed to the cultured schools of England, of France, and
of Germany.
      Thus far we find applicable to acting the principles of art laid
 down by two philosophic critics — one a poet of the eighteenth cen
 tury, imbued with all the culture and wisdom of classic lore, the
 translator of Homer, the familiar of the works of Plato and Aristotle ;
and the other the exponent of the modern scientific school of
philosophy, a professor par excellence of the plastic arts. We find
that what is essential to poetry, to music, to sculpture, to painting,
is also essential to acting.   Where, then, is the proof that acting is
not one of the sister arts ?    What is there in it that disqualifies it
from holding a place amongst them ? To assert such a thing is to
     -.

 assume the attitude of Cinderella's sisters in the fairy tale. Let me
 offer a suggestion in the shape of a logical problem.
      Hogarth painted a picture of David Garrick at a moment of his
 life and in such a way that all who ever saw him recognise the pro
   totype of a certain historical character.   No one denies — can deny —
   that this is a work of art. Now Shakespeare wrote a play in which
   Richard III.   is a character.  Can any one deny that this is a work
   of art? Garrick, in his playing, appeared on the stage in such
   wise that those who saw him knew that the man before them was
   the man Garrick, whilst at the same time he seemed by many signs
   and in many ways to be the image, copy — what you will — of
   Shakespeare's Kichard III., though Garrick gave his Shakespeare
   adulterated with Cibber.     Yet Garrick's work in producing this im
   pression was, we are to be told, not a work of art.     Why it was not
    I
   so   leave those to say who assert that acting is not an art. But let
  me point out to such that they will have this difficulty to encounter
  — if Garrick's purposed labour was not the exercise of an art,
  what was it ?   If  the product of such purposed labour was not a work
  of art, what was it ? The poet Shakespeare conceived a thought, the
  artist Shakespeare worked it out into dramatic form — the actor
  Garrick translated the poet's thought, as given in the artist's words,
  into something which the public who saw and heard recognised. The
  painter Hogarth took the image which he saw — Shakespeare's idea
  and Garrick's form transmuted by something not an art to a visible
  and tangible shape — and fixed it on his canvas for future ages to see
  and admire.     What, then, was it that broke the chain of intentional
  effort that led from Shakespeare's imagination to Hogarth's canvas ?
 Where is the flaw in this intellectual lode ? By what quip or crank
 of thought are we asked to deny that one alone of these varied steps
 in the crystallisation of a thought is not ruled by Art — and that one,
 man's intelligent use of the powers nature has given him ? Which
 denial reminds one of the butcher who asked whether Edmund Kean
 spoke the character of Othello out of his own head or learnt it from
 a book ; and on being told the state of the case, exclaimed against
 paying to hear a man repeat what every man able to read could do
 as well for himself.
                                                         I
      The only reasons for acting not being an art that have ever heard
 alleged, are that it is simply imitative or mimetic, that it does not
 create, that it does not last, and that it is not exercised with materials
such as are used in the other arts. The second of these has been
disposed of by the simplest examination of the word in its philo
logical aspect.      Let us examine the first. At the beginning      Ideny
that the statement is correct. But even if it were true — true in the
plainest and baldest way — this would not remove it from the category
where for positive reasons we have placed          it,   and for negative
reasons left it. All art is mimetic, and even M. Taine speaks of " the
three imitative arts of sculpture, painting, and poetry."          And   I
think that, asI       shall try to show later, we may add music to the
                                                             2   o

 category.    The function of art is to do, and not to create — it is to
 make to seem, and not to make to be, for to make to be is the
 creator's work.
     Now as to this question of imitation. The artist wishes to pro
 duce — to produce what ? Does the sculptor take his clay and the
 painter his brush and pigment and canvas, and the poet his pen and
 paper, and set to work to produce a vague something which will
 grow into the seeming of a real thing as he goes on ? Such an idea
 is ridiculous. The artist intends, and must intend, to carry out a
 thought.    It need not have originated in his own mind, but it must
 be there, howsoever begotten or received.     To try to realise an image
 existing in one's own brain so that it may become apparent to the
 senses of others, is the work of all art ; and it is because the outline
 in plastic art has to be exact — because its merit is judged by organs
 of mechanical accuracy, that it is necessary to reduce to exactness
 consonant with the realities of life, the vagueness of imagination,
 aided by the emotions.      Inasmuch as words allow of greater com
 plexity of thought than do tangible and visible things, so much
 freer is the poet or writer of any kind in the exercise of his art.
 When Shelley, in his Prometheus Unbound, describes Demogorgon
 " a tremendous gloom," he conveys an idea that cannot be conveyed
 adequately by any pictorial art. The blackest shadows of Rem
 brandt or Constable would be like sunshine beside the vague idea in
 the mind of the reader of these words who has an imagination to
 understand them. It is this necessity for exactness which compels
 the constant study of nature on the part of all artists.    There can be
 no higher aim than to reproduce nature — nature shorn of such
 external accidents as would distract the mind of the spectator —
 nature epitomised and yielding her secret meaning.         What is there
 in works of genius, howsoever they may be represented, which touches
 the heart with emotion ? We feel it as we gaze on the beauty which
 Canova wrought in marble, which Raphael and Velasquez and Van
 dyke and Reynolds and Gainsborough depicted on canvas, which
 Michael Angelo piled up to the dome of St. Peter's — or as we listen to
 the tender strains of Mozart, the sad witchery of Mendelssohn, or the
 tempestuous force of Wagner.        And yet the roots — the archetypes
               —
 of all these have lived, not perhaps in the cognate form in which
 they are known to us, but as elemental facts in which the skill and
 wisdom of man have garnered and treasured and used to these noble
 ends. The eyes of the sculptor and the painter beheld at some time
 the elements of the beauty which they reproduced.          The architect
 found his ideals in the rising stems and sweeping branches of the
 forest aisles, or mayhap in the piling up of sunset clouds.    And as to
 the music, every note of it is to be found in nature's choral forces —
 that mighty gamut of creation which rises from the tiniest whisper
 of whirring wings in the insect world, through the sighing of the
 night wind, the crackle of swaying corn, the roar of falling water,
 and the mighty voice of the sounding sea, up to the hiss of the

  lightning flash and the crash of the thunderbolt.    Who, then, is the
  truest artist ? He it is who best realises these myriad beauties and
  bounties of nature, and who best reproduces them so that others may
  understand the emotion which they have created in him; and
  beside these truths of nature all lower things must stand back abashed.

                              And secure His beautiful ! "
      So speaks the poet, Elizabeth Barrett Browning. And what says
 the master-poet, Shakespeare ? —
      " O'erstep not the modesty of nature ; for anything so overdone
 is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now,
 was and     is,
               to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature to show virtue
                                                                   :
 her own feature, scorn her own image and the very age and body of
 the time his form and pressure."
     Perhaps   I   may here quote Talma's words on the actor's art, since
 they   seem to illuminate, from an actor's standpoint, the applicability
 of all the rules which Taine has given —
     " The actor, in the first place, by repeated exercises, enters deeply
                                                  :
 into the emotions, and his speech acquires the accent proper to the
 personage he has to represent.      This done, he goes to the theatre not
 only to give theatrical effect to his studies, but also to yield himself
 to the spontaneous flashes of his sensibility, and all the emotions
 which  it involuntarily produces in him. What does he then do            In?
 order that his inspirations may not be lost, his memory, in the silence
 of repose, recalls the accent of his voice, the expression of his features,
his action — in word, the spontaneous workings of his mind, which
                   a
he had suffered to have free course, and, in effect, everything which,
in the moments of his exultation, contributed to the effects he had
produced. His intelligence then passes all these means in review,
connecting them and fixing them in his memory to re-employ them at
pleasure in succeeding representations. .         . By this kind of labour
                                                      .
the intelligence accumulates and preserves all the creations of sensi
bility."
     Let me supplement this with the words of                 a   famous American
critic of the past —Thomas R. Gould —
    " Not
                                              :
         with his usual vision of the germs and processes of genius

the words of the text, reasons upon, and infers the meaning, and so
extracts the character.     The result of this method, however carefully
and comprehensively employed, is at best but an abstract induction,
having something of the aspect of reality, but automatic, and without
 the breath of life. The other looks into a great creation, as if pass
 ing into a real presence ; is filled and atmosphered by its spirit ;
 listens to its language as to a living voice ; is brought into intimate
 relations with the springs of its being, and conceives it in unity by
 the power of a brooding and recreative imagination.
      " And unto this power — because ' it cometh not with observation,'
 but transcends the understanding, because it is vital and life-giving,
 and elevates Acting from a mimetic into an imaginative art, subor
 dinating the comparative intellect to its higher and self-justified
 laws — we feel bound to give, with a considerate and responsible
                                  '         "
 decision, the sacred name of Genius.'
      I  have myself heard a great actress say when coming off the
 stage :   I " could not act to-night ! " Of course she had acted well —
 her art was too good to fail her —what she meant was that on that
 particular occasion she felt herself without inspiration or ecstacy —
 that force which must be behind every great personal effort.
       Perhaps these examples may serve to point how the art of acting
  complies with Taine's idea as to the necessity of the artist experi
  encing
           " original sensation."
       Now as to endurance of impression, is it to be seriously put forth
  by any one as an argument that art ceases to be art because its
  work does not endure?        There are two questions here involved —
  first as to what is endurance, and second, what method of record
  does it require.    The life of all things of the world is bounded by
  time, and the many accidents and disasters which are time's agents
  of destruction.     Surely of all materials in which art can work,
  marble, and brick, and metal are the most enduring ; and yet the
  works wrought in them pass away. With the Parthenon and the
   Colosseum in ruins, and the great temples of the gods obliterated ;
   with the works of Praxiteles and Phidias almost unseen by any eye
   in their perfect beauty ; with the wilderness of Benvenuto's marvels,
   mainly long ago reduced to chaos in the melting-pot ; with Apelles
   a name, and even the names of the host of his compeers forgotten,
    who is to say that works of art need immortality in order that the
   labour to which they were due may be classed as art, or the labourers
   as artists ? Where are now those mighty works of man's art which
   came to be known as the
                               " Seven Wonders of the World " ? Where

   are the Pyramids mighty wrecks whereon Time has set his hand
   —the sole survivors of all the wonders of yore? Where is the
   mighty city Babylon, with its walls and temples and gardens? —

honour, and whose work was, and is, placed in the existing category
of the arts.
     So much for length of endurance ; but what of its records ? Are
the works only to exist, and not the memory of them?              Must a
record be written or graven in iron or marble ; or is it sufficient
that it lives from mouth to mouth till the very cause of its memory
be forgotten?     Nay, more; we ourselves have only memories to
help us in our daily life, for what is all education but organised
memory ? The efforts of plastic art which throughout our lives we
have seen and loved are seldom before us, but take their place in
memory, beside the fleeting visions which pass before us on the stage.
 Is not Roscius a name that lives in history, though he was neither
poet, nor sculptor, nor painter, nor architect, nor musician?          It
 would be foolish to say that a work is not a work of art because it
has not permanent existence in material shape.        If this be a condi
tion of art, then on the destruction of a work the worker ceases to
have been an artist.    All things are comparative, and we ourselves,
who have only the span of a few years to live, cannot claim immor
tality for our work.
                                                       I
     As to the medium in which the actor works, would seriously
ask if there is any one so benighted as to put it forth as an argu
ment.     Was that lion which the sculptor wrought in butter for his
patron's table less a work of art than the noble work of the dying lion
hewn in the rock at Lucerne ? Alas for the sculptor's storied pathos
if this be so ! for already time and weather have set their canker
ing hands upon the work. Was the shepherd lad's drawing on the
rock, as he tended his sheep, less by its nature a work of art than
when he painted altar pieces in the later years ? Were the painters
before the Van Eycks less artists than their successors because, in
default of better mordants, they had to use unpleasant materials to
fix their pigments ? Why, it is the sculptor himself who works in
the common clay, and it is his labourer who chisels out the marble
statue, from the clay model of his master. Why, then, should it be
any barrier to work being the work of art, because its elements are
the most complex known to man, and the tools in use no mere work
of the hands of man, but the noblest powers and qualities given by
God — the power of sympathy, the force of passion, the earnestness
of conscious effort ?
     The old professors have counted music amongst the arts. Let me
ask them a few questions relating to it. Is the art confined to the
coirposer, or is it shared by the interpreter ?    If the former, why is
it not enough to print the score, and let men read for themselves ;
it would save much labour, much expense. Wherein, with regard
to composition, is the limitation of art, since counterpoint is a science,
and melody an inspiration ? Was there no art in the interpretation
of his score by Paganini, by Liszt, by Rubinstein — or is all tho

428                 Mr. Henry Irving       on  Acting : an Art.       [Feb. 1,
delicate  and endless variety which an executant alone can give to
pass as an artless labour?           But if the term artist as applied to
music be not a limitation to the composer, wherein does the inter
preter of written music symbols, who can convey their meaning
through quite another sense, differ from the actor, who is also an
interpreter of written symbols, but of more infinite complexity, and
with ever-varying hidden depth ?            If  the actor's words and motions
go forth upon the empty air artless, what becomes of the sweet vibra
tions of the musician's art ? and if the interpreter of the composer's
scrip be an artist, whosoever may be the medium of his creating the
necessary vibrations by any work of man's hands, how much more
artist is the singer who uses that most complete and capable instru
ment — the human voice. Grant the singer to be an artist, then where
is the point of difference from the actor, who, also with endless modula
tions of voice, has to convey the myriad phases of thought and passion ?
     " The actor's effort is primarily to reproduce the ideas of the
author's brain, to give them form, and substance, and colour, and life,
so that those who behold the action of a play may, so far as can
be effected, be lured into the fleeting belief that they behold reality."
     Truly the actor's work embraces all the arts. He must first have
the gift or faculty of acting — a power which is as much a gift as
that of power to paint or to mould — and whose ordered or regulated
expression is the function of art.          His sympathy must then realise
to himself the image in the poet's mind, and by the exercise of his
art use his natural powers to the best advantage. His form and
emotions are, in common with the sculptor's work, graceful and pur
poseful ; his appearance and expression, heightened by costume and
pictorial preparation, are in common with the work of the painter,
and wrought in a certain degree by the same means and to the same
ends : his speaking is in common with the efforts of the musician —
to arouse the intelligence by the vibrations and modulations of
organised sound.       Was it by chance, or inspiration, or out of the
experience of a life amongst the arts that the poet Campbell wrote :
                   " How ill  can Poetry express
                       Full  many a tone of thought sublime  ;
                     And Painting, mute and motionless,
                       Steals but a glance of time ; ,
                   " But  by the mighty Actor wrought
                       Illusion's perfect triumph's come   ;
                     Verse ceases to be airy thought.
                       And Sculpture to be dumb."
     Acting may be evanescent, it may work in the media of common
 nature, it may be mimetic like the other arts, it may not create,
 any more than does the astronomer or the naturalist, but it can live,
 and can add to the sum of human knowledge, in the ever-varying
 study of man's nature by man, and its work can, like the six out
 of the seven wonders of the world, exist as a great memory.

              27le  Antitoxic Serum Treatment      of Diphtheria.
The subject with which we shall deal to-night, though at first sight
of interest to the physician only, has been so fully discussed and
so bitterly and irrationally opposed, perhaps also unreasonably be
lauded, that those who take even a general interest in the public
health, or who are wishful to obtain some insight into the practical
and scientific aspects of a new system of treatment, may well be
interested to know something of what is being so freely written up
in the columns of our daily newspapers.               Beyond this, however,
many take a more personal interest in a method of treatment which
holds out promise of help in the cure or amelioration of the symptoms
and conditions met with in diphtheria, a disease which, very justly, is
looked upon as one of the most treacherous with which the physician
                                 I
has to deal. To begin with, should like to make a frank confession.
With that conservatism which is met with even in the most radical
                                I
of natures, many, of whom was one, felt disposed to treat antitoxic
serum as belonging to the same group of substances as tuberculin,
around which was constructed a theory of which the laboratory
experimental    basis, though apparently fair and firm, was as yet
insufficient for the support of the structure of therapeutic treatment
that was afterwards raised upon it.         I   followed the earlier experi
ments   on this new   method   with  great  attention   ;  I carefully analysed
the principles   on  which  the method    was  founded,    and  then with some
misgivings watched the gradual development                of  the  treatment as
applied to actual cases of diphtheria.       I   was inclined to receive the
statistics with great reserve, as    I felt that this new method, like all
new methods of treatment, might be making cures in the minds of
the observer, and not on the bodies of the patients.              Now, however,
I  am convinced that whatever justification my incredulity may have
had from the consideration of previous experiments, none could be
claimed in connection with the experiments that were carried out
in the investigation of this special subject, and            I  am thoroughly
satisfied that, although the    antitoxic  serum     treatment    may not come
up to the expectations of all the rash writers on the subject — for
many people seem to think that it should be a specific against
diphtheria in all its stages — it promises, and this promise has in

part been redeemed, to diminish the diphtheria case mortality in a
very remarkable manner.
     Diphtheria is primarily an inflammation of the mucous membrane
(the moist skin) of the tonsils, of the soft palate, of the upper part of
the gullet, and of the upper part of the windpipe. [Illustration shown.]
During the course of this inflammation, which appears to be set up
by the action of a special bacillus, there are usually thrown out some
of the fluid elements of the blood and some of the white cells that
float in the blood ; these form a soft toughish layer or film which
offers an excellent food and resting place for this bacillus of diph
theria, which under such favourable conditions secretes or manu
factures a most virulent poison.            This poison is rapidly absorbed
into the blood and is carried to various parts of the body ; its effects
are evident at first only on the nervous system, but afterwards on the
muscles.
     First as to the   bacillus.    In  1875 Klebs described a short bacillus
which he found on the surface of the greyish leather-like diphtheritic
false membrane or film. [Illustration shown.]              Following up these
observations, Loeffler traced a definite etiological relationship between
this bacillus and diphtheria. First he obtained pure cultures of the
bacillus by growing it on solidified blood serum, or on a mixture of
three parts of blood serum and one part of neutralised beef bouillon
containing extract of beef, 1 per cent. of peptone, 0*5 per cent, of
common salt, and 1 per cent. of grape sugar.             This organism may be
readily   detached   from   the  surface   of the  false membrane by pressing
firmly   but  gently   with  a  little  bit of  cotton   wadding twisted round
 the end of an iron wire or an ordinary penholder.         [Illustration shown.]
 When stained and examined under the microscope, the diphtheria
 bacilli are found to be small rods from 3 to 6 p (1 /* = Tghnt o^
 an inch) in length, fairly plump, straight, or slightly curved, some
 times wedge-shaped or pointed [Illustration shown], but usually
 somewhat enlarged and rounded at the ends, where also in stained
 specimens, the protoplasm is more deeply tinted than in the centre.
 This organism grows singly or in groups, or felted together to form
 a net-work ; it may occur in irregular masses of considerable size.
 When these bacilli have been growing for some time on an artificial
 nutrient medium, they appear to be segmented, the stained material
 accumulating in small round nodules placed at intervals within a
 kind of membrane which is only very delicately tinted.               During the
 past five weeks   I  have examined about 500 specimens taken from the
 throats of diphtheria patients, and          I may say that in nearly every
 case where the disease has been diagnosed by the physician in charge,
 as being one of diphtheria, these typical bacilli have been found,
 whilst in those cases in which there was any doubt as to the nature
 of the disease, similar bacilli were found in some, but not in others.
     This is of importance, because we shall find that this bacillus
 gives us the substance with which animals are rendered immune to
 the attacks of the bacillus itself, these immune animals in turn sup

   1895.]       on the Antitoxic Serum Treatment of Diphtheria.        435
   plying the antitoxic serum. To prove that this bacillus is really
   the cause of the disease, Loeffler, in an elaborate series of experi
   ments, inoculated     the pure cultures of the bacillus grown on
   artificially prepared media, into animals; he was thus able to set
   up characteristic lesions, especially if he took the preliminary pre
   caution to abrade slightly the mucous membrane, thus, as it were,
   ploughing the ground before scattering the seed. On such abraded
   surfaces the bacilli grew very luxuriantly, and false membranes were
  produced ; in these lesions the bacilli could afterwards be found and
  again separated in pure cultures, whilst the characteristic toxic
  symptoms of diphtheria were, in each case experimented            upon,
  repeated with the utmost fidelity.     Loeffler also pointed out a most
  important fact in connection with the presence of the organism in
  the body. He found that it was strictly confined to the local wounds
  or lesions in the throat and posterior part of the nose, and he was
  also able to prove that in this position these organisms commenced
  to manufacture most virulent poisons, which, unlike the bacilli, can
  become diffused throughout the body.          Klein and Sydney Martin
  in this country have both made very valuable contributions to our
  knowledge, the former concerning the bacteriology of the disease,
  the latter in regard to the chemical action on the tissues of the toxic
  or poisonous products of the bacillus.
       Martin found that after the poison formed in the throat has made
  its way into the internal organs of the body it undergoes certain
  changes; it is broken down into somewhat less poisonous com
 pounds, but these, accumulating at certain points, act especially on
 the nerves and muscles.       It appears then that we have to deal with
  two sets of poisons : a very virulent poison formed by the bacilli
 directly from the fibrin and albuminoids of the fluids of the blood,
 exuded on the surface of the mucous membrane ; and secondly, a less
 poisonous series which appear to accumulate especially in the spleen.
 So long as these poisons remain in the body we have the general
 fever, rise of temperature, and altered conditions of circulation (as
 evidenced by the pulse), so characteristic of the disease.     At a later
 stage, sometimes after all the primary symptoms of diphtheria have
 passed away, there are often met with what are called post-diph
 theritic paralyses, which are due apparently to alterations in the
nerves going to muscles, especially those going to the delicate
 muscles of the soft palate and around the opening into the windpipe,
though other groups of nerves and muscles may be similarly affected.
These post-diphtheritic paralyses may be due then to the action
either of the virulent poison (ferment) formed in the membrane, or
of the somewhat less poisonous, but more stable toxines that are
formed in the later stages of the disease. Through the kindness
of Dr. Martin        I am enabled to show you figures of nerves and
muscles, the degeneration of which is due to the action of these
poisonous substances [Illustration shown]. It is here unnecessary
to enter into any detail as to the minute changes that take place in

436                      Dr. O. Sims Woodhead                   [Feb. 8,
the nerve and muscle fibres, but on comparison of the affected nerve
fibres with a healthy nerve fibre, it is evident that we have here
grave structural alterations which must interfere most materially
with the power of the nerve to conduct nerve impressions from the
spinal cord to the muscle.     The outer part or sheath of the nerve
is in some places entirely wanting, whilst in other cases the axis
cylinder or core of the nerve is either greatly attenuated or entirely
absent.     The poison in these cases has set up changes by which the
communicating paths between the muscles and the spinal cord and
brain have become thoroughly disorganised.           The muscles, too,
instead of being formed of cleanly striated fibres, have this striation
greatly obscured, first by a kind of cloudy or ground-glass look, and
later by the appearance of a number of strongly refractile granules.
These, when stained with osmic acid, become black, from which we
argue that they are composed of fat, and it is said that the muscle
has undergone a fatty degeneration, the muscular protoplasm being
partially converted into fat ; ultimately the striation may be almost
lost. In a case of diphtheria, then, the following stages may be
traced : a sore throat (often simple enough to begin with), by which
the mucous membrane is prepared for the reception of the diphtheria
bacillus. The diphtheria bacillus becoming implanted on this surface,
gives rise to an acute inflammatory condition, and, subsisting on the
inflammatory exudate, sets up a local manufactory of a most virulent
 poison.    This poison, absorbed into the circulation, at once acts on
the nervous system, although a certain proportion seems to be broken
down into a more stable, but less virulent, poison, which remains in
the body, and may continue to act for a considerable time on the
nerves and muscles.
     Whilst these poisons are attacking the more highly organised,
 and therefore less stable tissues, they are stirring up or stimulating
 the other tissues of the body to resist their invasion and action.   If
 this were not the case, any one attacked by diphtheria must eventu
 ally succumb to the disease ; but we know that a considerable pro
 portion of the cases of diphtheria recover even when no treatment
 at all is resorted to. Whatever may be the exact explanation of this
 recovery, we know that it depends upon the power of certain cells in
 the body to accommodate themselves to the presence of the toxines,
 and to go on doing their work of scavenging and of removing
 foreign substances from the body even under what originally were
 adverse conditions; during this process the cells become so pro
 foundly and permanently altered that the patient is for some time
 protected against further attacks of the same disease. It was origin
 ally maintained that this alteration was entirely confined to the cells,
 but it is now generally accepted that these cells form or secrete sub
 stances which, thrown into the blood, either act directly upon the
 toxines so as to interfere with their activity, or so react upon the
 cells that they are able to continue their work in the presence of the
 toxine.    At all events, a certain immunity against the disease is

    1895.]      on the  Antitoxic Serum Treatment of Diphtheria.         437
    acquired.    Upon these various theories is based the rationale of the
    antitoxic serum treatment of diphtheria. Ferran claims to have been
    the first to obtain such a condition of immunity against diphtheria in
    animals ; shortly afterwards, Fraenkel in Germany obtained similar
    results.   Seeing that this immunity depends upon an alteration in
    the composition of the serum, should it not be possible, argued Pro
    fessor Behring, to take the serum of an immunised animal and transfer
    it to a patient suffering from diphtheria, so as to help the tissues
    and cells of the patient to cope with the toxic products of the diph
    theria bacillus during the earlier stages of the disease, inducing, as
    it were, a kind of artificial immunity to help the patient over the
    acute period of the attack when the poisons, though most virulent,
   are most unstable, and when the tissues have not yet become accli
   matised to the presence of the toxic products of the bacillus ; when,
   in fact, they are paralysed and are able to do little to protect them
   selves.    Behring so followed up this idea, that he was able to initiate
   a system of treatment which promises to revolutionise our therapeutic
   methods in the treatment of certain specific infective diseases.
        Working on the fact that an animal might be rendered more and
   more insusceptible to the action of the toxic products of bacteria,
   Behring found that he might proceed in either of two ways. He
   might make an artificial wound with a needle, and introduce weakened
   bacilli into the animal, the weakened bacilli then growing but feebly
   and producing a modified toxine. After the effects of the first dose
   had passed off, he was enabled to increase the dose and to use more
  active bacilli, injecting them first into the tissues and eventually
  directly into the circulation, with the result that enormous doses of
  virulent diphtheria bacilli might ultimately be introduced without
  giving rise to more local swelling or general febrile disturbance
  than was first noticed when the small dose of modified bacilli was
  introduced.      Such a method as this, however, was attended with con
  siderable drawbacks, as it was almost impossible to gauge, at all
  accurately, the number and strength of the bacilli. Not so, however,
  with the products of the micro-organisms the activity of which could,
  of course, be more accurately measured, and the dose more exactly
 graduated.       The bacilli might multiply and continue their action on
 the tissues, but the poisons when injected alone would not alter in
 quantity or activity. As may be readily imagined, the fluid con
 stituents of the blood can only contain those substances that are
introduced into it from without, either through the vital activity of
 the cells of the body, the products of which must be thrown into this
fluid before they can be excreted, or through artificial injection. The
antitoxic substances, then, found in the blood of an immunised animal,
must in the case of natural immunity following an attack of diph
theria be the result of the activity of the tissue cells, especially of
the connective       tissue and white blood cell groups which have been
" stimulated " by the toxines introduced from without, from the falso
membrane in the throat. Where it is desired to produce an artificial

                                 " antitoxic serum, the cells are stimu
immunity, and an " artificial
lated by the introduction into the body of artificially prepared toxine.
The cells acted upon by the toxine elaborate the protective fluid,
which is thrown into and accumulates in the blood.        This substance
may act in one of several, or even in several ways.          (1) It may
directly antagonise the diphtheria toxine, and may thus prevent the
paralysing action of these poisons on the scavenging cells or phago
 cytes, as they are called ; these, left free to perform their proper
 functions, can deal with the foreign elements that have got into the
 blood, and also with the bacilli at the seat of the local attack, for, as
 has been pointed out by several foreign observers, and by RufFer in
 this country, immediately beneath the layer of bacilli in the false
 membrane there is usually a very considerable           accumulation   of
 leucocytes, especially in those cases in which recovery ultimately
 takes place.    (2) The antitoxic substances may act on the bacilli,
 inhibiting their growth and interfering with their power of producing
 toxines.    This, of course, can only be a local action should it play
 any part in the process.      (3) These substances may act directly on
 the cells of the blood, lymph, and tissues, so stimulating and
 strengthening them that they are able to perform those functions above
 mentioned.     It is at present difficult to state which of these pro
 cesses is the one, or the most important, in protecting or curing the
 patient, and it may be that all play a part. It may be that the
 tissue cells, when acted upon by the specific diphtheria poison,
 become so modified that they are enabled to produce or secrete a
 substance which directly antagonises the action of that poison. This
  substance, thrown into the blood, remains there for some time, rapidly
 accumulates as larger and larger doses of the poison are thrown in,
  neutralising the poison, whose power of doing damage to the tissues
  is thus held in check, but remaining for some time after the toxine
  has disappeared ; or this antitoxic substance, reacting upon the cells,
  may render them less susceptible to the action of the toxine.
      The earlier immunising experiments were naturally performed
  upon the smaller animals, such as rabbits.    Then Behring used sheep,
  and after various other animals had been tried, the horse was selected
  by Roux and Nocard, and Aronson, as perhaps the best of all animals
 from which to obtain antitoxic serum. In the first place, he is com
  paratively insusceptible to the action of the diphtheria bacillus — even
  comparatively large doses of living bacilli may be injected under the
  skin without producing anything more than a slight local swelling
  and a rise of temperature.     It has also been found that horse serum,
  when injected, produces little or no change in the healthy human
  subject — that is, the serum seems to mix perfectly well with human
  blood plasma, and there is comparatively little danger of the extra
  serum being excreted by the kidneys in the form of albumen.         This
  is a most important point, and one that no doubt influenced Roux and
 Nocard in their selection of the horse as an animal from which
 to obtain immunised serum.        Beyond this, however, the blood, when

  1895.]      on the Antitoxic Serum Treatment of Diphtheria.          439
  drawn from the vessels, separates very perfectly into two portions —
  a firm clot, which if the blood be caught in a cylindrical glass jar,
  forms a kind of column in the centre, and a clear straw-coloured
  serum which accumulates around the clot, and forms a layer often
  several inches deep above it. [Illustration shown.]     This serum con
  tains the antitoxic substances.      Lastly, considerable quantities of
  blood can be obtained from such a large animal as the horse, and if
  he be well fed, groomed and exercised, the process of bleeding may
  be repeated pretty frequently without causing any inconvenience to
  the animal : in fact, he stands bleeding as well as did our forefathers,
  who thought as little of being bled as we think of going to Aix or
  Buxton.
       Let us now turn for a moment to the method of treating the horses
  that we wish to render immune, in order that they may supply the
  antitoxic serum that is to be used for the treatment of cases of
 diphtheria. Roux's method, which is that that has been most care
 fully described, and which is the one used in this country first by
 Dr. Ruffer at the British Institute of Preventive Medicine, and then
 by Professor McFadyean at the Royal Veterinary College, consists
 in introducing diphtheria toxine of a given strength in gradually
 increasing doses, until the blood of the animal so injected is found
 to contain a sufficient quantity of the antitoxine.
      The toxine with which the animal is to be injected is made as
 follows :— A broth is prepared by soaking a pound of finely-minced
 beef in water.     This is allowed to stand for twenty-four hours in the
 cold.    To the fluid expressed from the meat fibre at the end of that
 time is added £ per cent, of common salt and 2 per cent. of peptone
 (meat artificially digested by pepsine).
                                             This broth is then rendered
 faintly alkaline by the addition of soda salts or caustic soda. This
 is done because it is found that the diphtheria bacillus cannot grow
 at all vigorously, or form its poisons rapidly in an acid solution, and
 such poison as is formed is neutralised, or is unable to act in the pre
 sence of even a faint trace of acid.     It is found that even in Roux's
 solution, which is always faintly alkaline to begin with, an acid
 reaction soon appears, but, after about ten days, this is replaced by
an alkaline reaction, and as soon as this takes place, the growth of
the bacilli takes on new activity, the quantity of toxine is increased,
and it becomes much more virulent.          Roux found that he obtained
his most virulent toxines after three weeks' or a month's growth.       If
the growth is allowed to go on longer than this, a process of oxida
tion appears to take place, and    I  have found that the toxine from a
culture carried on for two months had already lost much of its toxic
activity. It should be noted that a virulent bacillus should always
be taken in the first instance, otherwise the results may be very
disappointing.
      This nutrient broth is placed in a layer of not more than half an
inch thick in a flat-bottomed flask, which is plugged with cotton wad
ding, and then closed with an indiarubber cork or cap. [Illustration
                                                            2 h 2

shown.]     Through this composite plug three tabes are passed into
the flask ; the two lateral tubes are bent at right angles, both inside
and outside the flask ; whilst the centre tube is fitted with a small
thistle-head, which may be plugged with cotton wadding, and then
closed with an indiarubber cap.        The outlets of the lateral tubes are
also plugged with cotton wadding, and the whole apparatus is kept
for an hour or two in steam maintained at a temperature of 100° C.
(Flasks so treated may be preserved for years without any change,
beyond some slight evaporation, taking place in the broth.)          A small
quantity of a pure broth culture of the virulent diphtheria bacillus
is now drawn into a long thin pipette, the indiarubber cap and the
cotton wadding plug are removed from the thistle-head, and the con
tents of the pipette are introduced; the pipette is withdrawn, the
cotton wadding is replaced, the indiarubber cap is fitted in position,
and the flask is placed in an incubator which is maintained at the
temperature of the body (98° -4 F., or 38° -2 C), or better still a
degree or two below this. As soon as the growth is well started
(usually at the end of about 24 hours), a current of moist air is
made to pass continuously over the surface of this cultivating fluid,
the air being first warmed and saturated with moisture, in order as far
as possible to prevent evaporation.         A fine flocculent deposit soon
makes its appearance on the bottom of the vessel, the supernatant
fluid remaining clear.       This deposit increases in thickness, much
more luxuriant growth going on after the first ten days.           Toxine is
formed by the diphtheria bacilli so long as they can grow freely —
that is, so long as they can obtain sufficient nutrient material from the
fluid and from the air that is continually passing over the surface.
At the end of three weeks, or even less, if all these precautions are
taken, the toxine should be of such a strength that ^ of a c.c. (about
two or three drops) injected into a guinea-pig weighing 500 grammes
(over 17 ounces) will kill it within 48 hours.        The strength of the
toxine or poison may be a little greater or a little less than this, but
it is a comparatively easy matter to measure the strength, and there
fore to graduate the dose to be used in immunising the horse.           This
only   holds good,  however,  if the active diphtheria  bacilli are removed
or destroyed ; these, if left in the fluid, would be a complicating and
inconstant factor in the equation.       In order to kill these bacilli the
Germans recommend the addition of $ per cent, of carbolic acid to
the culture ; the dead bacilli falling to the bottom, leave a perfectly
clear supernatant fluid. The French, on the other hand, recommend
the separation of the bacilli from the fluid by means of a Pasteur-
Ghamberland     filter. By this means a clear virulent poison which
does not contain any diphtheria bacilli is obtained.       With this fluid,
a horse with a good constitution, and which has been proved to be
free from tubercle and glanders, is injected under the skin of the side
of the neck in front of the shoulder.        Small doses are first injected,
either pure or with the addition of \ of the volume of weak solution
of iodide of potassium.      If  the fluid is of full strength, only about

1  or 2 c.c. can be given at the first injection. This is followed within
 24 hours by a local swelling at the seat of injection, about the size
 of the palm of the hand, and the temperature may rise 1° or 2° F.
 (£° to 1° 0.), otherwise the general health of the horse does not
seem to suffer.     He eats well, and unless regularly exercised may
become very lively ; of this we have had ample evidence during the
recent frost and snow, when it has been unsafe to give much exercise
to horses that are not very sound in limb, and as a result they have
been very fresh indeed.        As soon as the swelling has disappeared
and the temperature has receded to the original level, a somewhat
larger dose is given ; the same process is repeated time after time
 (the dose being gradually increased to bring about the same amount
 of swelling and rise of temperature) for about three months, or until
 such time as the requisite amount of immunity is acquired, i. e. until
 the antitoxic action of the blood is sufficiently marked.      That there
 is a gradually increasing immunity is evidenced by the fact that
 enormously large doses of the toxine in the later stages of the
treatment produce even less local and constitutional disturbance
than was observed after the first few injections of comparatively
small quantities.
     The blood is now drawn off from the jugular vein of the immunised
horse by means of a metal cannula or tube to which is attached an
indiarubber tube ; these are first thoroughly boiled, in order that no
living micro-organisms of any kind may remain on or in them, and
 the skin of the horse is carefully cleansed with some antiseptic lotion.
 The indiarubber tube leads the blood into a carefully sterilised
flask or vessel provided with a double paper cap, a well-fitting
cotton-wadding plug or a glass-stopper.          The vessel when filled is
placed in an ice-safe until the solid part, the clot, is completely
separated from the fluid — the serum.         From each gallon of blood
about 1A to 2 quarts of serum is expressed, though this varies
considerably in different cases, and according to the time that the
separation is allowed to continue (24 to 48 hours).         This serum, a
limpid straw-colcured fluid, is carefully decanted under strict anti
septic precautions, and, mixed with carbolic acid or camphor, is
stored in small phials, each of which contains about a sufficient quantity
for the treatment of a single patient. [Illustration shown.]        In the
Pasteur Institute, and in the British Institute of Preventive Medicine,
the antitoxic serum is apparently brought up to such a strength that
y-Jj, of a c.c. injected into a medium-sized guinea-pig (500 grammes,
or over 17 ounces) will protect it against an injection 24 hours
later of £ c.c. of a culture of living diphtheria bacilli strong enough,
if given by itself, to kill the guinea-pig in 24 hours. It is usually
recommended that 20 c.c. of this serum should be given at the first
dose, and that if necessary a second 10 c.c. should be given half an
hour later.
     The method of testing the strength of the serum adopted by the
Germans is that devised by Ehrlich, who takes ten times the lethal

442                        Dr. 0. Sims Woodhead                  [Feb. 8,
dose    of diphtheria toxine, and in a test-tube adds a definite and
known quantity of the blood to be tested. This mixture is then
injected into a guinea-pig, and if the antitoxic power of the blood
has been gauged aright, the animal does not suffer in the slightest
degree from what under ordinary circumstances            would kill ten
guinea-pigs.     The addition of less or weaker serum, or of more
toxine, would leave the mixture still toxic.
      In order to obtain a definite standard with which to compare the
antitoxic power of any serum, and to determine the dose of such
 serum, Behring and Ehrlich have described what they term a normal
antitoxic serum — that is, a serum of such a strength that Tiff of a
c.c. added to ten times the lethal dose of diphtheria toxine is exactly
sufficient to render it innocuous, 1 c.c. of such normal serum contains
one " immunisation unit," and should be sufficient, when added to a
hundred times the lethal dose and injected, to render it innocuous.
 In horses wholly immunised the serum may be fifty or even a hundred
times as active as the normal serum above mentioned, and the dose
to be given varies according to the number of immunisation units in
any sample.     It is not here necessary to go into the question of dose,
 but it may be stated that 500 of these immunisation units are usually
 necessary to produce the desired effects in cases of diphtheria, though
 in some cases still larger quantities have to be used. Behring now
 supplies four strengths of the serum, the weakest (marked with a
 yellow label) is sent out for injection of cases where the disease has
 not already been contracted.       The next (marked with a green label)
 is of a strength of 600 antitoxine units, and is given to those cases
 in which the treatment is commenced at the very outset of the disease
 — that is, when the first symptoms of diphtheria manifest themselves.
 The next stronger antitoxic serum (white label) equals 1000 anti
 toxine units, and is used for cases somewhat more advanced in which
 the prognosis is at all grave ; whilst in still graver cases, and where
 the symptoms have been developed for some considerable time, it is
  often necessary to give a serum of 1500 units ; this is marked with a
  red label, and is, of course, highly concentrated in order that the size
  of the dose may not be unduly increased. In place of No. 1, healthy
  children and adults who are exposed to diphtheritic infection may
  receive a quarter of the dose of the green label flask, which Behring
  considers will protect against diphtheria with very great certainty.
  Although these general directions are laid down, it is strongly
  insisted upon by Behring, Kossel, Roux, and in fact by all those
  who have had experience of antitoxic serum, that the dose must vary
  according to the severity of the disease, so that much must be left to
  the discretion of the medical practitioner in charge of the patient.
   The great error into which those who first use this agent fall, is the
  administration of far too small a dose, especially in the case of
  children, for whom the dose is nearly as large as it is for adults.
  For this reason some of the statistics published in this country and
  abroad are far too unfavourable to the method.      The great drawback

not only as a curative or direct therapeutic agent, but also as a pro
phylactic — that is, as a protective agent against possible infection,
especially during epidemics of diphtheria. It is almost too soon to
consider this prophylactic property of antitoxic serum, as for some
time to come the energy of those engaged in the preparation and use
of this serum must be directed towards obtaining a sufficient supply
for the treatment of cases of developed diphtheria.
     It may be well to consider what have been the results obtained
up to the present, and for this purpose the statistical method will
probably carry most conviction, especially if it is possible to give
full and accurate detail ; and now that these statistics have been
criticised not only by those who have used this treatment, but also
by those who oppose it because it runs counter to their feelings and
ideas, they are every day more and more trustworthy, much fuller,
and more valuable.
     It is first necessary to determine the average case mortality in
diphtheria for some considerable period before the antitoxic treat
ment was introduced ; then to see what has been the lowest case
mortality during an equal and similar period for which we have any
statistics ; and lastly, to compare these with the case mortality of the
period during which the antitoxic serum has been used.

      Dr. Sykes gives the following statistics: — During the year 1892
 there were 1962 deaths from diphtheria in London, whilst in 1893
 there were 3265, or nearly twice as many deaths.
      Now let us see what has been the case mortality. Statistics after
 correction give the following results.            During 1893 there were
 13,694 cases of diphtheria notified in London.                The mortality
 amongst these cases was 3195 (Lancet statistics corrected), or 23 *3
 per cent.
      Table  II.  gives further information, and enables us to see what
 is the diphtheria case mortality in large well-found hospitals.
      In Table   III. are given statistics dealing with the diphtheria case
 mortality where the serum treatment has been used.                Wherever
 possible, the case mortality over a considerable period is given in

 is given. In order to determine the foundation upon which this
 certainly very legitimate objection is based,                  I  have taken four series
of cases as reported, and have placed them side by side. The per
centages of deaths at certain ages in the London Asylums Board
hospitals before the serum treatment are given in Table IV., the
percentages of deaths of four observers who have used the serum,
in Tables V. and VI.
     It is very important, however, that the period of the disease at
which the treatment is commenced should be taken into account, for,
as already indicated, experience has taught that the later the stages
of the disease at which this serum is injected, the stronger must be
 the dose given.         It is necessary, therefore, to separate the cases in
which the treatment is commenced at an early period from those in
which it is commenced only when the poison has had time to dis
organise the tissues, and to render them incapable of reacting to the
antitoxic serum.
     Table VII., p. 448, given by Kossel, brings out the great import
ance of this element in keeping down the case mortality. In the first
column is given the day of the illness on which antitoxic serum was
first injected.
     For statistical purposes, too, only those cases which have been
bacteriologically examined and found to be due to the action of
Loeffler's diphtheria bacillus should be accepted as being cases of
true diphtheria.            As most of the cases in which the diphtheria
bacilli are absent run a much milder course, and are much more
amenable to general treatment, and as many of these have been
included under diphtheria in the old statistics, such elimination will
necessarily make the record tell rather against the antitoxic serum
treatment than in its favour.
     From a somewhat extended experience (although condensed into
a very short period of time)               I   am satisfied that this question of the
Loeffler bacillus is most important, and that every case in which the
serum is used should be bacteriologically examined.

     It has been said, however, and said very truly, that statistics may
                                         I
be made to prove anything, and have heard it said that the observa
tion of a few cases of diphtheria under the antitoxic treatment is
worth all the statistics that could be brought together for the purpose
of convincing a man of the value of the antitoxic serum treatment.
     A distinguished physician, who has had charge of diphtheria
wards for some time, informs me that the patients he now sees wear
an entirely different aspect from those he saw before the serum treat
ment was adopted.           Instead of being struck by the stupor, the pain,
the difficulty of breathing, and the other distressing symptoms that so
frequently manifest themselves during the course of this treacherous
disease, he observes children with patches of membrane in the throat
sitting up and playing with their toys.               There is little of that
distress of breathing, very little of the anxious look, and the wards
altogether present a much more pleasant and genial appearance
than he has ever before noticed.            The other day  I   received a short
note from another colleague, who has been going over the German
hospitals to study this question, in view of taking out with him to
the colonies a supply of antitoxic serum; he also states that this
difference in the appearance of the diphtheria wards has impressed
him far more than any statistics he has yet come across.
     It has been said that most unfavourable symptoms have followed
the exhibition of this serum.            There can be no doubt of the fact ;
but after a careful study of the cases reported,        I am thoroughly con
vinced that a very large proportion of them, at any rate, are merely
post hoc, and not propter hoc.          There can be no doubt that a kind of
nettle-rash makes its appearance during the course of treatment, and
that this may be accompanied by pains in the joints. Both these
conditions, however, are usually quite transient, and seldom give
rise to permanent ill effects. Albuminuria has also been ascribed
to this treatment ; but any one who has had to deal with children
not only suffering from diphtheria, but from any form of disease,

 1895.]     on the   Antitoxic Serum Treatment of Diphtheria.           449
 and even from none at all, is aware of the fact that albuminuria
in children is of comparatively frequent          occurrence.     It is not
 striking,  therefore, that those who  have  hitherto paid  little attention
 to this subject should, when they come to make a careful examination
 of children affected with diphtheria, find a considerable number of
 cases in which transient albuminuria is a prominent symptom.          More
 than this, however, it has been my duty to examine a large number
 of cases in which diphtheria has proved fatal, and in these cases
 there were certain lesions in the kidney, so distinct and so frequently
 present, that in describing them   I  used to note simply " diphtheritic
 condition," and then describe in detail only those features in which
 the appearances differed from the type that    I had in my mind.       This
 will indicate to you that alterations in the internal organs, especially
 in the kidneys, such as would lead to marked interference with the
 performance of their proper functions, were present, and had been
noted long before the antitoxic serum method of treatment came
into use.   I   may give an example of what, under certain circum
 stances, might have been used as a powerful argument against the
use of antitoxic serum.      In the Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschri/t
for December 20 of last year is reported a case of acute haemorrhagic
nephritis coming on after the use of Behring's curative serum. The
patient recovered.     But a similar case of acute haemorrhagic nephritis
in diphtheria, in which, however, the curative serum was not used,
is reported in the same number of the same journal. The author of
the second paper quotes some interesting statistics to show that
albuminuria is of frequent occurrence in cases of diphtheria not
treated with antitoxic serum.      One observer found it in 131 out of
279 cases; another in 16 out of 53; another in 60 per cent, of all
 his cases ; another in 227 out of 470. Suppression of urine has
also been ascribed to the action of this agent ; but here again, if a
careful search be made of the records of diphtheria cases treated
 under the old method, it will be found that just as in scarlatina and
acute specific infective diseases generally, but especially in those
associated with rapidly supervening toxic symptoms, suppression of
urine is of common occurrence ; and until we have statistics on these
several points, which can be compared with those above mentioned,
it will be impossible and unjust to ascribe conditions to the thera
peutic agent which, so far as those best able to judge can see, are to
be ascribed to the disease itself.
     It has been held by some that the paralysis which is so common
a sequela of diphtheria should disappear entirely under the use of
what they are pleased to call a specific cure for the disease. It
should be remembered that the antitoxic serum cannot make good
any organic damage that has been caused by the action of the toxic
products of the diphtheria bacillus.   It may stop their action on      the
tissues, andit  may stimulate the tissues to react against the poi» ii
                                                                              '

 damage already done.      This damage may be done at a very early
 stage of the disease, and if the nerves or the muscles are attacked
 before the antitoxine is injected, then we must expect to find degene
 rations and evidence of these degenerations in the various forms of
 post-diphtheritic paralysis ; but of this we may be sure, the sooner
 the poison is antagonised the less will be the risk of permanent
 damage to the tissues.     It is for this reason, I believe, that the
 antitoxic serum treatment of diphtheria has been so much more
 successful than the antitoxic serum treatment of tetanus.
     The hope of success in the serum treatment of diphtheria depends
 upon the early application of the remedy.       One word of warning.
 It should not be accepted that this agent can reduce the cure of
 diphtheria to a mere process of injection. Everything must be done
 to improve the conditions under which the patients are treated, to
 maintain their strength, to give them fresh air, cleanly surroundings
 and good general hygienic conditions.     It will be found withal that
 a certain number of deaths from rapid poisoning will take place,
 while a number of others will succumb in the later stages of the
 disease.   This serum can no more act as a specific in every case than
 can quinine cure every case of malaria ; but if properly used, we
 believe it will reduce the mortality in a very marked degree, and if
 at the same time those practical sanitary reforms and improvements
 for which our country is so justly renowned are carried out, we may
 expect that diphtheria as a scourge may gradually die out from our
 midst.    As Dr. Seaton pointed out at Buda-Pesth, we have done
 more in this country to improve the conditions associated with most
 specific infective diseases than any other nation in the world. If,
 now, we can graft on to our system what is best in Behring's treat
 ment,   I am convinced that we shall soon have diphtheria statistics
 which will compare very favourably with any that have yet been
 presented.    The antitoxic serum treatment is only one of our lines
 of defence against this disease ; but so much progress has already
 been made along this line, that within a few years, or even months,
 we may fairly anticipate the announcement of still greater advances
 and successes.

                   Influence   of Science   on Mountaineering.
Between mountaineering in general and climbing, which is but a
special branch of mountaineering,         I  desire for the purpose of this dis
course   to draw   a  clear  distinction,  but  do not wish it to be supposed
that my dwelling chiefly       on  mountaineering implies any depreciation
of simple climbing.          On the latter it is well nigh impossible to
break new ground, save in the geographical sense.              The climbers of
mountains cannot justly be accused of any exaggerated tendency to
reticence as regards their adventures.           The technique of climbing is
really simple, and considered as a craft, the subject has been fully
dealt with. Indeed, the general principles that the climber has to
bear in mind have been reduced to rules so few and so simple, that
many can quote, and a certain proportion can follow them.
      I desire chiefly to-night to dwell for a short time on the part
that science has played in developing tho growth of mountaineering.
This has not been adequately recognised.              The popularity of moun
taineering during the last thirty-five years, the period of greatest
activity, has been too much laid to the credit of writers who have
regarded and described the Alps as a field for the best of recreations.
 The more solid work was less before the world. Geologists and
 botanists, from the first, found in the Alps a magnificent field for
 pursuing their own branches of work ; but in the matter of physical
 science the work done was speculative, not experimental.            Men sought
 for evidence  for  or  against  the  Deluge,  or  elaborated vast hypotheses of
 the earth's formation.      They concerned themselves little with attempts
 to explain the phenomena going on under their eyes, and there was
 little original investigation. In old books on the Alps, statements,
 often of the wildest nature, are found copied from one to another
 without the slightest trace of acknowledgment.             Men whose lines of
 thought led them into the direction of physical research came late
 into the field, but gradually their work attracted in some quarters the
 attention due to a new departure.          So there arose men who gathered
 from the amassed knowledge of works of science such facts and
 observations as might be turned to practical account in mountain
 exploration. Thus was developed the scientific mountaineer, who,
 on the mountains, could use his head as well as his limbs. He
  might or might not be one who made science his prime object when
 among the mountains.          I  am far from saying that this is the ordinary

 452                           Mr. Clinton T. Bent                      [Feb. 15,
  type of the mountaineer of to-day ; but it must be the type of the
 mountaineer of the future, who wishes to extend his sphere of
  exploration beyond the restricted field of the mid-European Alps.
  The pioneers were numerous.               Such names as Agassiz, Studer,
  Rendu, Forbes, Ball, occur at once to the mind ; but             I must limit
  myself to-night    to  two   only,   De   Saussure  during  the  last  century,
  and Tyndall in recent times.
      The true value of De Saussure's work can only be estimated by
  considering the scientific chaos with regard to glacial phenomena
  that was widely prevalent before and during his time.           It is not long
  since that avalanches, mountain falls, the bursting of glacial lakes
 and such like occurrences were considered generally to be the work
  of fiends or evil spirits. The legends that smiling Alps were con
 verted into snowfalls and glaciers as punishment for man's wickedness
 were widely credited.        Dragons were supposed to haunt the moun
 tains, and were implicitly believed in by men such as Wagner, the
 naturalist, little more than two hundred years ago. Long after
 the legendary ages, of which traces enough can still be found in the
 Alps, and still more plainly in other mountainous countries, the state
 of physical science as regards mountains and glaciers was in a very
 primitive condition, owing largely to the terror with which mountains
 were generally regarded.          De Saussure reduced to order by direct
 observation, by experiment, and by clear and impartial writing much
 of the confusion.      It must be remembered that in the days when he
 travelled accurate maps were unknown. Thus, in a map of the early
 eighteenth century, Chamonix is depicted as some sixty miles south
 of the Mont Maudite, the name by which Mont Blanc was then often
known. Strange views indeed are to be found in the old writers,
whose desire to be credited with universal knowledge allowed them
 little time for accuracy of detail. Crystals were supposed to be
formed by the excessive pressure to which ice was subjected.                 One
marvels that mountains do not sink into the earth by their own
weight ; another believes that they would certainly do so were they
not hollow.      Lakes well stored with fish were imagined to be present
on the top of all high mountains.           Besson, who wrote in 1786, was in
advance    of his time, but  it is to be  feared that he borrowed largely from
De Saussure.       He  advocates    the  determining of mountain phenomena
by direct observation and experiment.              Griiner, in 1760, the year
De Saussure first visited Chamonix, published a treatise describing
accurately the main features of the results of glacial motion.              Still
in De Saussure's time the progressive movement of glaciers was
questioned.      The very foundation of scientific mountain craft lies in
knowledge     of  glacial phenomena and of the results of glacial motion,
and De Saussure proved these convincingly enough.               Previously, the
regular downflow of a glacier was often confounded with the increase
or diminution of the mass of ice as a whole.                De Saussure inde
pendently confirmed and extended Gruner's work.               He distinguished
clearly between the high snowfalls and the true glacier. He explained,

  1895.]         on Influence  of Science on Mountaineering.          453
  too, the formation of moraines.     Theory thenceforth was replaced by
  direct observation.     The principle of the progressive movement of
  glaciers may now seem obvious enough.         Yet for ages the moraines
  had stretched out their long lines, the dirt bands had traced their
  curves, the ae'racs had formed, leant over, toppled and fallen, the
 crevasses had started, widened and closed up again, but the interpreter
 had been wanting.
      With De Sauesnro's geological work        I   have here no concern.
  Most valuable and interesting are his observations on the effect of
  high altitudes and diminished pressure on the human frame, for these
  have a direct import to the modern mountaineer, and to the mountain
  eering question of the day.      De Saussure was the true type of the
  scientific mountaineer.     Yet had it not been for the sensational
  exploit of the guide Jacques Balmat, in 1786, in ascending Mont
  Blanc, and had it not been for the wide interest that this feat evoked,
 De Saussure's work might have remained comparatively unnoticed,
  and it may be equally true that had it not been for such work as De
 Saussure's, few might have passed through the door which Jacques
  Balmat unlocked.      Unquestionably the ascent of Mont Blanc marked
 an epoch.     Probably there were quite as many in Balmat's day who
 would have questioned the possibility of ascending Mont Blanc, as
 there are now who would question that of ascending Mount Everest.
      De Saussure's observations on the law of the decrease of tempera
 ture in the atmosphere according to altitude are of the utmost value
 to mountaineers.      The influence of cold as affecting the possibility
 of making higher ascents, is a factor now recognised as of the first
 importance.      For many years after De Saussure, little more was
 accomplished in mountaineering       than repetitions of ascents of Mont
 Blanc.
      Modern mountaineering dates its birth in the decade 1850-60.
 It was in 1856 that Tyndall first visited the Alps, ascending Mont
 Blanc the following year.       Just as De Saussure's work was empha
 sized and supplemented         by Balmat's achievement, so Tyndall's
 researches came opportunely during the active revival of mountaineer
 ing when the conquest of the great Alpine peaks was proceeding
 apace.    Though Tyndall, like De Saussure, went originally to the
 Alps from purely scientific motives, he at once fell under the fasci
 nation and became an enthusiastic and a highly skilled mountaineer,
 which De Saussure never really aimed at. To very few will it ever
 be given to combine so happily the qualities of man of science and
 mountaineer which were so conspicuously shown in Tyndall, but to
many it may be possible to work on the same admirable lines. With
the views which excited controversy at the time they were divulged,
such as theories of glacial motion, and the viscous or non-viscous
qualities of ice,    I  have now fortunately no concern.     It need only
be said, looking at the views that now obtain on this last question,
that it is hard to perceive any ground for fundamental difference of
opinion. The divergence of views really turned largely on the exact
      Vol. XIV.     (No. 89.)                                   2 I

454                      Mr. Clinton T. Bent                   [Feb. 15,
definition of a word. One feels almost inclined to echo John Hunter's
well-known condemnation of definitions. On one point there can be
little doubt; Tyndall's views fitted in admirably with practical
mountaineering.     He rendered clear and precise the interpretation
of so many glacial phenomena that he almost made what is known as
snowcraft— the most intricate, and the most valuable branch of
mountaineering, for it is on excellence in snowcraft that the future
of mountain exploration chiefly depends. But the great influence he
had on mountaineering was through his brilliant writings and lectures.
Owing largely to these the glacial world began to attract the general
interest which before had been confined to the few who had frequented
and climbed the high Alps. This result was due to his admirable ex
 perimental methods and to the brilliancy with which he expounded his
 views, and it was in this theatre mainly that the exposition was made.
 T may throw on the screen a slide, a view of the Weisshorn by
 Mr. Donkin, which almost epitomises the lectures on " Ice, Water,
Vapour and Air." Imagine that from the water in the foreground
 rises the vapour in solution. The warm air as it rises expands. The
 expansion produces cooling ; as a result of the cooling the vapour is
 condensed and the cloud is formed.     Once formed, the band of cloud
 may remain stationary and of uniform size for a long time, constantly
 forming afresh on one surface, and as constantly diminishing on the
 other.   Or the cloud may increase in volume.       Following it then
 further in imagination till it becomes a rain cloud, the view shows
 the light fresh snow which has fallen on the higher flanks of the
 mountains.    The snow sinks as the crystals part with their contained
 air, and so the mass by its own weight is pressed into firm snow, then
 into nev6, then again into pure ice, which melts and flows away as a
river. The circle is complete and the whole life history of a glacier
 is shown in this one view — not the less notable in that it is the pre
 sentment of the mountain on which Tyndall's greatest climbing feat
 was accomplished   in 1861.
     Time forbids any endeavour to repeat the more striking of the
 experiments shown to illustrate these processes, but I may bring
 before your notice once again the simple experiment first made by
Faraday in 1850 to illustrate regelation. This simple observation
 on the properties of regelation was applied by Tyndall to the inter
 pretation of many glacial phenomena.     He showed that as the glacier
 passed through any narrow channel or was torn and fissured as it
 swept over the slopes or formed an ice-fall that the ice was subject
 to crushing, and he demonstrated that pressure alone was sufficient
to account for the complete remoulding of the mass, the closing of
 the crevasses, and the re-establishment      of the purity of the ice.
 Unless snow possess these properties all travel on the snowfields
 would be impossible.   When below the freezing-point regelation does
not take place.   This fact, with regard to the highest ascents where
 the cold may be extreme, is of obvious significance.        Under con
ditions of extreme cold, and where the snow contains little air,

 it will   often be powdery, as was found on the first ascent of
 Chimborazo.      This condition is rare in the Alps. In the latter,
 indeed, the worst conditions of snow seldom in the summer months
 turn back the mountaineer, but in higher regions, where time is of the
 first consequence, it would be of the greatest moment to judge before
 hand in what condition the snow is likely to be found.       The compass
 bearings with regard to the sun of the slopes up which the track lies,
 the prevailing winds and their temperature, the radiation from rocks
 in the neighbourhood and such like factors must be taken into account.
 With regard to the formation of crevasses Tyndall did much work,
 though it was limited rather to the lower portion of the glacier, and
 extended little above the ice-falls.      He showed most clearly the
 method of formation of crevasses, longitudinal, transverse and oblique.
 Many years previously Besson had said " the ice of a glacier flows
 like a torrent following fluid laws," probably not appreciating the
full truth of his own remark. Tyndall by careful measurement
 showed the situation of the point of maximum motion and demon
strated that when a glacier curved, the point of maximum motion lay
 nearer the convex border of the glacier. Thus in a glacier whose
 course is serpentine, the lines of maximum rate of motion crossed the
 central line at each curve.    From this a practical point in mountain
 eering   can  be deduced.    In  descending an unknown glacier, it is
 generally best when the ice cannot be quitted to keep on the side of
 the smaller curve of the glacier where the marginal crevasses will be
 less numerous on this border.         I can recall an occasion in the
 Caucasus when inattention to this point led to our being benighted
on the glacier.
      On the so-called dirt-bands, first noticed by Professor Forbes in
 1842, Tyndall made many observations.         It is matter for regret that
a feature of glaciers so beautiful as these great curving stripes should
have received so unpoetic a name.          Tyndall clearly demonstrated
their formation in the ice-falls. To the mountaineer much that is
practical may be gathered from their presence. Thus the existence
of dirt-bands shows conclusively that there must be an ice-fall at
some part of the glacier, and that there must bo rocks in the neigh
bourhood capable of yielding the grit of which the dirt-bands are
composed.      Several glaciers may coalesce and form the main stream.
Thus the Mer de Glace has three tributaries ; on one, the Glacier du
Geant, the dirt-bands are strongly marked, on another, corresponding
to the Glacier de Talefre, they are but faintly indicated, while the
third, the central stream, has no dirt-bands at all. These several
streams can be distinguished one from another, to the very extremity
of the Mer de Glace, by the medial moraines. It is certain then that
on two of the glaciers higher up will be found ice-falls, and that the
third, the central, will lead by more or less gentle declivities to the
snow basins that feed it. Suppose the Mer de Glace were an unex
plored field visited for the first time, such an observation might ob
viously be of the highest value in determining the route to be taken.

      If it be true that with more accurate knowledge of glacial phe
 nomena     mountaineering skill has improved, and mountaineering
 possibilities extended, it would naturally be expected that the progress
 would be more shown in the class of amateurs, as they are termed,
 than in that of the professional guide.             I
                                               Such think, and    I  have the
 authority of some first-rate guides of long experience to back me, is
 the case.    Much has been said on the comparative skill of guides and
 travellers. The truth probably is that the best guide of to-day is
 fully as good a man as the best guide of any other period, while the
 general standard of mountaineering        proficiency among travellers has
 greatly improved, though there will probably be not a few laudatorea
 temporis acti to question such a conclusion. Mountaineering has,
 however, developed in such a way that no comparison is possible now
 between the traveller and guide, and none is needed. For the more
 difficult work that yet remains to be done, the qualities that the
 guide shows best are absolutely essential to achieve the best possible
 success; and so also are the qualities that the traveller has in a
 great measure developed.           The traveller and guide can each
 supplement     the qualities  of the other, and they who are interested
in the progress of mountaineering ought to be as much concerned
with encouraging the development of guiding skill as of advancing
their own. In one other respect Science may possibly do much
for the future of mountaineering by throwing light on the pro
blems that still environ the question of the effect of high altitudes
and diminished atmospheric pressure on man.            Here the mountaineer
comes in direct touch with the physiologist.         The evidence gathered
so far has come from three sources.           Some from laboratory work,
some from experience on the mountain side, and a certain amount
from those who have made balloon ascents. So far, it must be allowed,
the laboratory work has not been fruitful in practical results ; but
the question as recently revived is really still young.         In the very
few minutes that remain      I may be able very briefly to sketch how the
matter now stands, and indicate what progress has been made as to
its practical solution.
      First, as to the contribution of the mountaineer. On this diagram
are indicated certain ascents, selected chiefly because in their descrip
tion special reference has been made to the effect of high altitude on
the travellers.     The subject has for long received occasional attention.
Sometimes in the early accounts surprise is expressed at the absence
of effects which have for centuries been noticed and commented on.
Thus Deluc on Mont Buet (10,200 feet) seemed quite astonished that
he did not suffer from mountain sickness.              On Mont Blanc, De
Saussure was considerably affected and gave an admirable description
of the symptoms.       De Saussure thought it improbable that scientific
observations such as he wished to carry out could ever be properly
made at so great a height — and now there is an observatory on the
top, and a railway station, as     I understand, is in contemplation.      In
the numerous accounts dealing         with  Mont    Blanc published   in  the

                    on Influence      of Science     on Mountaineering.                     457

 early part of this century, the effect of the rarefied air is almost
 uniformly mentioned.           Often, it may be suspected, this was because
 the writer thought it proper to allude to the subject rather than
 because he really suffered from mountain sickness.                         Within the last
 few years   the  expedition       has   several    times    been    made    from Chamonix
 to the top of   Mont      Blanc     and    back    to   Chamonix       within    twenty-four
                I
 hours ; once believe         in   about    eighteen       hours.     The     vertical  height
 to be ascended is over       12,000     feet.   In  the    ascent   of  Elbruz    (Caucasus)
 one party experienced             no discomfort            at all, another party was
 affected. Of the more recent experiences in the Andes and Karakoram
 1 need hardly remind you. Perhaps the Karakoram expedition shows
 the greatest height reached, though not much above the Schlagintweit
 expedition.     A very curious point is brought out by the chart, viz.
 that heights   far   exceeding Mont Blanc had been reached long before
 the ascent of    that    mountain drew attention to the question.                        Thus
 the Karakoram       Pass,   about     the   height    of   Elbruz,    has   been   known    for
 centuries as a well established              trade     route,    and    another     pass  (the
 Changlung) of over 19,000 feet has long been known. Indeed,
 Western people were still speculating on the possibility of ascending
 to any higher elevation than that of Mont Blanc, while centuries
 before in the East men had reached points nearly 4000 feet higher.
 Assuming that the highest point of the earth's crust is about 30,000
 feet, this other diagram shows in another form how much has been
 accomplished by mountaineers, and, it may be added, how little
apparently remains to be done. The question of the ascent of the
highest point indicated (Kabru) on the diagram is doubted by many
good authorities. There is no doubt about the height of the moun
tain which has been triangulated, but the question is whether the
travellers did not mistake the peak they actually ascended. Whether
the party actually did so or not, seeing that there is conflict of opinion,
must remain uncertain.              But the Earakoram experience, the latest,
tends to   show    that   it was    certainly     not physically impossible.
      Experiments     in  the  laboratory       have   been conducted with apparatus
on a large scale      similar     to  that    which     I  show you here in miniature.
By means of this apparatus            the   atmospheric        pressure can be reduced to
any degree required,         and    the    pressure       can   be, by an ingenious con
trivance,   maintained absolutely              constant      for   any desired length of
time.
      This apparatus has been devised for other purposes, but essentially
it could   serve  like M. Bert's "pneumatic cabinet."                      You may judge,
and judge rightly,        that   the    conditions       produced      in a   man who shuts
himself up    for   a  time   in   such    an    apparatus       and   lowers    the pressure
are different    from      those     on   the   mountaineer.          At    least    M. Bert's
pneumatic cabinet          has  proved       the   existence      of  other    factors  in the
problem.      M. Paul        Bert,     experimenting           on    himself,     sustained    a
                                       to   32,528     feet   for  a  short    time  — a lower
diminished pressure equal
pressure than that of Mount Everest. From many experiments he
was led to the conclusion that deficiency of oxygen was the main cause

458                          Mr. Clinton T. Dent                 [Feb.   15.
of the symptoms — like those of mountain sickness —experienced.          He
set down the limit of life as arriving when the air contains but    7 per
cent, of oxygen, the normal amount being 20 per cent.             He was
therefore led to infer that by supplying oxygen the evil effects of
diminished pressure could be warded off. To carry a sufficient
supply of oxygen on the mountain side would be physically im
possible.   Mr. Whymper's experiences disprove M. Bert's theory, and
Bert's views received a further shock in the fatal balloon in which
MM. Croce\ Spinelli and Sivel lost their lives, dying from asphyxia at
a height of about 28,000 feet, although they had a supply of oxygen
with them. M. Bert's researches have attracted much attention, but
the work of Geppert and Frankel published in 1883 really carried
the question as regards laboratory work a good deal further.           And
here, I  hope  Imay be pardoned, if       I
                                         turn only for a moment    to some
physiological details.    Geppert and Frankel found that life could be
sustained, without supplying oxygen, at a far lower pressure, viz. that
of 180 mm. of mercury, equivalent to a height of 36,400 feet. Yet
more, they pointed out clearly that three distinct stages could be
observed — that of difficulty of breathing, paralysis, and lastly, uncon
sciousness or coma.    On the first and third much has been written.
But it is the second of these three stages — the partial paralysis —
which has received far less attention, that affects profoundly the
question from the mountaineer's point of view. Geppert and Frankel's
results seem absolutely trustworthy.          They bear out, too, even
allowing for possible error in observation, the experience of those
who have ascended in balloons.         Life unquestionably can be main
tained at far greater elevation       e. at
                                    (i.       much lower pressure) than
                                               a
that of the highest mountain.       In the pneumatic cabinet, two most
important factors do not come into play. No exertion is required
beyond that of breathing, and there         no lowering of temperature.
                                              is
In high balloon ascents again no exertion          required of the lower
                                                   is
limbs. The same effects that are shown under diminished pressure
are also shown at greatly increased pressure.      The circulation in the
portion of the spinal cord or marrow immediately concerned with tbe
innervation of the lower limbs becomes greatly disturbed. The partial
loss of power in the lower limbs     is brought about in this wise. The
blood collects and stagnates at this portion. It has been stated, but
incorrectly, that the reverse condition       is
                                            produced.   The temperature
of all the extremities  is greatly lowered,  not only by the surrounding
cold but  by   change in the nerve centres themselves.   The importance
of this disturbance to the mountaineer who seeks to attain the greatest
elevation on foot  is obvious.   Yet this, the most significant feature   of
the problem from the climber's point of view, seems to have attracted
little attention. The practical effect of this partial paralysis must be
to render each step which involves the raising of the weight of the
body doubly or trebly as laborious as        would be at the pressure to
                                              it

that the effects can be completely recovered from, and this partial

loss of power is, as far as can be judged from what is at present
known, though a formidable obstacle and one not generally recognised,
not insuperable.     Possibly medical means may be discovered to
combat the condition.        Oxygen   as a remedy has failed: other
remedies may be found. Certain drugs recently introduced produce
effects not unlike those which result from diminished pressure — a
significant fact.    One curious effect of diminished atmospheric
pressure has been noted, and has been held to compensate for the
diminution in the amounts of oxygen, a diminution that as Professor
Roy has suggested must be increased on the mountain side when
there is any melting of snow, inasmuch as water will absorb oxygen
more readily than nitrogen from the air. If any stay is made at an
elevation of some 13,000 feet, as Viault has shown, there is an
enormous increase in the number of the red blood corpuscles, that is
to say, an enormous increase in the area of the surface concerned with
the absorption of oxygen.      At the sea level the ratio of the body
surface to the blood surface is as 1 to 2560; while at a pressure
corresponding to 13,000 feet the blood corpuscles so increase in
number as the ratio of the body surface to that of the corpuscles has
altered to 1 to 4293. Putting the matter in another way, the actual
corpuscle surface at sea level = 3840 square metres ; at 13,000 (after
11 days) = 6144 square metres.         But though the increase of the
corpuscles may begin    at  once, the  multiplication is a slow process.
The maximum is perhaps reached in three to four days.

It   is hardly possible to imagine that the first experimenter who
obtained an electric spark sufficiently strong to produce a sensible
sound should not at once have been struck by the fact that he
was in the presence of thunder and lightning on a small scale.          We
find, indeed, in various writings from the early days of electrical
machines a number of suggestions that the thunderstorm               is an
electrical phenomenon ; but to Benjamin Franklin belongs the merit
of having perceived that a direct experiment was needed to prove
what so far was only a guess.           In an article entitled "Opinions
and Conjectures Concerning the Properties and Effects of the Elec
trical Matter, arising from Experiments and Observations made at
 Philadelphia, 1749," the following passage occurs : —
      "To determine the question whether the clouds that contain
lightning are electrified or not,   I  would propose an experiment to be
 tried where it can be done conveniently. On the top of some high
 tower or steeple place a kind of sentry-box, big enough to contain a
 man and an electrical stand.      From the middle of the stand let an
 iron rod rise and pass, bending out of the door, and then upright
 20 feet or 30 feet, pointed very sharp at the end.             If
                                                              the electrical
 stand be kept clean and dry, a man standing on           it,
                                                         when such clouds
 are pas-ing low, might be electrified and afford sparks, the rod drawing
fire to him from cloud.
                     a
    " If any danger to the man should be apprehended (though         Ithink
 there would be none), let him stand on the floor of his box, and now
 and then bring near to the rod the loop of          wire that has one end
                                                      a

himself describes having used a kite in Philadelphia in a letter dated
October 19th, without giving the date of his observations.             But this
must be supplied in some passage which         I  have not been able to find,
for Rosenberger * mentions that it was done in June.
     Franklin's disbelief in the dangerous character of the experiment
must have received a severe shock when he heard of the death of
G. W. Richmann, who, in the year 1753, was killed by an electric
discharge drawn from the clouds by means of a kite.
     The thunderstorm is the most impressive effect of atmospheric
electricity, though it is rivalled in beauty by the aurora, and in
interest by the many phenomena of daily occurrence, which are only
made perceptible to us by proper instruments.            In a lecture delivered
before this Institution on May 18, 1860, Lord Kelvin described the
delicate electrical appliances constructed by him for the more accurate
observation of atmospheric electricity.          The problems then for the
first time clearly stated, gave a powerful and still lasting impulse
to the investigation of atmospheric electricity, and though no decisive
answer can be given to all the questions raised in that lecture, recent
researches have brought us somewhat nearer to their solution.
     Observations which may be made every day and at every place
have shown that the earth is electrified, whatever the weather may
be.    In the language of the older theories, which we cannot as yet
altogether abandon, we say that the earth is covered with negative
electricity, or, in modern phraseology, we express the same idea by
the statement that we move about in an electrified field, that electric
lines of force stretch through the air from the ground, from our bodies,
and from everything which is exposed to the sky overhead.                   The
strength of this electric field is not at all insignificant. If we wish
to produce it artificially between two parallel plates kept at a distance
of one foot, we should have to apply an electromotive-force sufficient
— and sometimes more than sufficient — to light up the incandescent
lamps which illuminate our dwellings. The electric force is compara
tively weak in our country, but 50 volts per foot are constantly
observed, and 100 volts are not uncommon; but in dryer climates
the amount of the force may be considerably in excess of these
figures.
     If we fix our minds on the lines of force starting from the surface
of the earth, we are at once led to ask, Where is their other end ?
Do they curve round and back again to earth? Do they end in
the dust which everywhere surrounds us, or do they reach up to the
clouds ? Do they pass through the clouds and end where invisible
particles separate the sunset red from the midday blue ? Or, finally,
do they leave the earth altogether, and form intangible bonds between
us and the sun, the stars, the infinity of space ? These are not idle
questions, and we cannot be said to have solved our problem unless

4G2,                          Professor Arthur Schuster                [Feb. 22,
some definite        answer is given to them.        The last-mentioned view,
propounded originally by Peltier, and latterly supported by Exner,
is the simplest.         If  we could allow that the earth, once electrified
negatively, could remain electrified for ever, the corresponding
positive electrification being outside our atmosphere altogether, the
chief difficulty of atmospheric olectricity would be removed, and the
normal fall of potential at the surface would be explained by the
permanent negative electrification of the surface.
       Unfortunately, this view, to be tenable, has to assume that the
atmosphere is a complete non-conductor to the normal electric stress,
and this is known not to be the case.              We know of several causes
                                which break down the insulating properties
                                of air.    If two pith balls are electrified and

                                showing that they have lost their charge, and
                                consequently that the flame of the match has
                                destroyed the insulating power of air. It is
                                not only the flame itself which conducts, but
                                also the gases rising from the flame.*       The
                                following experiment will prove this. In
                                Fig. 1, A represents a metallic tube bent
                                round at the upper end, and containing at
                                its lower end a Bunsen burner in metallic
                                contact with the tube, which is also con
                                nected to an electroscope.       The tripod T
                                which supports the tube is insulated by
                                blocks of paraffiD. A Leyden jar, L, on a
                                separate support, is placed so that the knob
                                stands at about the level of the upper part
                                of the tube, which acts as chimney to the
                                flame. The knob of the jar may be a few
                                inches away from tho opening of the chimney,
                                and not necessarily in a line with it. The
              Fig. 1.           experiment      succeeds, although the gases
                                 rising   from  the burner may not come into
contact with any part of the jar.                The jar is charged, and care
must be taken that no fibres of dust attach themselves either to the
jar or chimney.         I have found it convenient to join a piece of amal
gamated zinc to the end of the chimney.              Under these circumstances
the charge of the jar will be found to leak across to the tube, and the
 leaves of it will diverge.         If, as in Exner's form of electroscope, the
 leaves,    on  reaching   a certain   divergence, discharge by forming a con

  being altogether      surrounded     by  a tube   of the same potential, cannot
  be active    in  this case, but  the  conductivity must be due to the gas as
  it escapes from the chimney.
       It follows from these experiments that every fire burnt on the
  surface of the earth, and every chimney through which products of
  combustion pass, act like very effective lightning conductors, and
  would consequently discharge, slowly but surely, any electrification
  of the surface of the earth.              The peculiar immunity of factory
  chimneys against damage by lightning appears from statistics col
  lected by Hellmann in Schleswig-Holstein,* for while 6 ¦3 churches
  per thousand were struck, and 8'5 windmills, the number per
  thousand of factory chimneys struck was only 0 • 3.
       Franklin was acquainted with the action of flames ; he also dis
 covered that no charge could be given to a red-hot iron ball, a fact
  which seems to have been forgotten until re-discovered in our own
  times by Guthrie.         Franklin also tried the action of sunlight, but
 obtained no result. Had he performed the experiment with carefully-
 cleaned zinc, he would have anticipated one of the most striking of
 Hertz's discoveries.         We now know that a negatively-charged surface
 will discharge into air when illuminated by strong violet light, and
 sunlight will be sufficient with specially sensitive materials.                 This
 action     has  been investigated    in  detail by  Elster  and     Geitel, who have
 not, however, succeeded        in  obtaining results with sunlight acting on
 such bodies as we know the earth's crust to be made of. So far, then
 we have no experimental evidence to include light as an active agent
 in the phenomenon of atmospheric electricity.
       We possess in the electric discharge itself a very powerful, and
 probably very generally active means of breaking down the insulating
 power of air.         Some of the experiments t which             I  described some
 years     ago  to  prove this, were   objected   to on  the ground that it might
 not be the discharge itself, but the ultra-violet light sent out by the
 luminosity of the discharge, which was active. The following form
of the experiment conclusively shows that the discharge acts inde
pendently of light.
      In Fig. 2, K represents a Ehumkorff coil entirely surrounded by
a metallic box B, which is connected to earth.                     The terminals of
the coil lead to two electrodes inside a metallic tube T, which is
also kept at zero potential. This tube is arranged so that a current
of air can be blown through it. The air, on escaping through the
tube, is made either to impinge on or to pass near a metallic plate
connected to a charged electroscope.              Under these circumstances, the
electroscope is not discharged either by a current of air alone, or by
the coil alone. But as soon as the air is blown through the apparatus
while the sparks are passing and then made to impinge on the

the action is due to dust, but rather that the cotton-wool acts in
increasing very considerably the interval which elapses between the
time at which the spark acts and the time at which the sparked air

passes out of the tube.    The effect may be observed even though the
tube L is lengthened by an addition of another piece 3 ft. or 4 ft.
long.
    Several phenomena, one of which had been known for a long
time, can be explained by the fact that the electric discharge changes
the condition of the gas into a state similar to that of gases rising
from flames.   It is mentioned, for instance, by Faraday that electric
sparks are liable to succeed each other along the same path, and it is
known that the same holds for lightning flashes, facts which them
selves point to a higher conductivity of air along the path of the
previous discharge.    A curious instance of a similar effect is afforded
by lightning  conductors,  which are sometimes put up to protect over
head leads used for conveying a high-tension current. Owing to the
obvious impossibility of connecting the leads directly to earth, a
small air gap is interposed, the idea being that the air gap will act
as an insulator for the current the leads are intended to carry, but
that if during a thunderstorm the potential rises sufficiently high to

 be dangerous, equalisation may take place through the air gap to earth
 by means of a small spark.            So far, the air gap answers its purpose,
 but as soon as a spark passes through the gap, it destroys the insulating
 power of the air, and the main current consequently takes a short-cut
through the gap. At Fontresina, in the Engadine, lightning conductors
 put up in this way are so sensitive that a flash of lightning several
 miles away causes a small spark by induction, and instantaneously
 puts out every electric lamp in the town.
     If we accept the view that an electric discharge destroys the
insulating power of the gas, it follows that the outer regions of
the atmosphere must conduct, for we have ample reason to suppose
that electric currents are passing continuously through those regions.
The aurora borealis in the arctic regions is, according to Norden-
skiold's observations, a permanent phenomenon, and the diurnal
changes of terrestrial magnetism show that in our latitudes electric
currents traverse the air above us. However small a conductivity we
may assign to the atmosphere, the earth could not remain electrified
inside such a shell of partially conducting gases. Lord Kelvin drew
the same conclusion in the Royal Institution lecture, on the assump
tion that gases at much reduced pressures cease to insulate.                We
may leave it an open question whether the normal electric stress
could in itself cause a discharge in the outer regions ; but we cannot
deny that under existing conditions these regions do not insulate, and
Lord Kelvin's argument still holds good.
     But the question of the ending of the lines of force — in other
 words, the location of the positive charge corresponding to the
negative electrification of the surface of the earth — can only be solved
by balloon or kite experiment, and we may briefly mention the more
important results which have so far been obtained.
     Observations made up to heights of about 1000 feet seem to
indicate a strengthening of the electric field — i. e. the fall of potential
per metre is greater at a height of, say, 200 metres than on the
surface of the earth.          The observations of Dr. Leonhard Weber*
bring out this point clearly. In one case the fall of potential at a
height of 350 metres was found to be six times that at the earth's
level. This increase is in itself not surprising, if we remember that
every particle of dust raised from the ground must itself be nega
tively electrified, and probably the observed increase in the electric
force is sufficiently accounted for by the presence of electrified dust.
     Observations made at greater heights in balloons, on the other
hand, seem clearly to indicate that this increase soon ceases, and that
a diminution already takes place at moderate heights.                Thus the
observations of Dr. O. Baschin f gave for the fall of potential in volts
per metre the numbers 49, 28, 13 at heights of 760, 2400, 2800 metres
respectively, and at a height of 3000 metres no measurable fall at all

could be obtained.       These observations were made in clear weather.
The   balloon  afterwards  passed over a layer of clouds, and strong electric
effects were   noticed.   Similar observations had been previously made
by others (Andree, Le Cadet, and Bornstein), and though the subject
is by no means exhausted, we may take it as provisionally established
that the lines of force of the normal electric field of the earth end
within the first 10,000 feet or 15,000 feet. This result is of great
importance, for it shows that in fine weather there must be a layer of
positively electrified air permanently above us.            Currents of air in
this layer must affect the field as we observe it, and possibly the
daily period may be due to changes in the currents of air at a
moderate height. A fact discovered by Exner is of importance in
connection with this subject.        Observing at three different places (in
a field close to Vienna ; in St. Gilgen, on the Wolfgangsee ; and on
the hills near Venice), he found that whenever there was a strong
south wind, with a clear sky, the normal electric force was always
increased, and sometimes considerably.*
      The daily changes show, with few exceptions, a remarkable uni
 formity at different places. There are in general two maxima of poten
 tial — one at 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning, and one in the evening.
 The evening maximum is the most marked, while at some places, and
 especially near towns, the morning maximum disappears.                 The same
 general   features  of the  daily  variation  have    been   found  to  hold at a
 number of European stations,       at  Cape Horn, Melbourne, and in the
 Northern Arctio regions.        If the variation is separated into two —
 one having a period of 24 hours, and the other of 12 hours — the
 latter is found to agree in phase at widely different places on the
 earth's surface, while the former is found to vary to a much greater
 extent, and hence to be probably more affected by local circumstances.
 The remarkable researches of Hann have given a similar result for
 the diurnal variations of the barometer, and we may reasonably con
 clude that the semidiurnal variation of atmospheric electricity is
  connected with the same circulation in the upper regions of the atmo
 sphere which shows itself in the corresponding changes of pressure.
      In addition to the more regular periodic changes, the electric
 stress observed in fine weather shows marked differences on different
  days and at different seasons.      With respect to these, the researches
 of Prof. Franz Exner f have led to the important result that there is
 a close connection, direct or indirect, between the amount of aqueous
 vapour present in the atmosphere and the fall of potential observed
 at the surface of the earth.      If p0 be the pressure of aqueous vapour
 present in centimetres, Exner -deduces the equation for electric force P

    The formula agrees very well with observations in which the
vapour pressure varied between 0 • 23 and 0 95, and it is especially to
                                           •
be remarked that it is the amount of vapour and not the humidity
which determines the electric force. Observations made by Mr. E.
Drory during a journey round the world fit in very well with
Exner's formula, and observations made at such widely different
places as Suez, Albany, Sydney, Colombo and Penang showed a fall
of potential practically identical with that calculated from the above
formula, though the same constants were taken and the vapour
pressure varied between 0*8 cm. and 2-2 cm.

research.    Their investigations have shown a satisfactory agreement
with Exner's formula, if the mean values of a number of observations
in which the vapour pressure is approximately the same, is considered.
But individual numbers differ very widely from the mean, so that the
 formula cannot be used to predict the normal fall of potential on any
particular day. There           is,
                                perhaps, nothing surprising in the great
divergence of such individual results if         itconsidered that we only

of the total amount of water in the column of air over the district
 in which the observations are carried out. The same authors have
shown that an equally good agreement can be obtained             instead of if,
 the amount of aqueous vapour, we take the intensity of active radia
tion as the determining circumstance.        The light might be supposed
to act on the general surface of the earth, as           does according to

sunlight actually does act in the manner indicated on any substance
forming part of the earth's surface. It           impossible at the present

time to enter more fully       into  this subject, but attention must bo
drawn to the very important indirect result, that there seems to be a
connection between ultra-violet radiations and the amount of aqueous
vapour present in the air.
     The phenomena of atmospheric electricity have been studied at
the mountain observatory established on the " Sonnblick," in Salzburg,
at a height of 3100 metres.
     The important result has been established that the electric force
is singularly constant. The great differences observed at low levels
between the electric field in summer and winter, or on dry and wet
days, seems to be completely absent, and these facts tend to support
the conclusion derived from balloon observation, that the positive ends
of the lines of force are situated at           height of something like

a marked extent the normal fall of potential. As the surface of the
earth is negatively electrified, it follows that dust carried up by the
wind must be electrified, and it is found, indeed, that in violent dust
storms the laws of force near the surfaces are altogether distorted
and reversed in direction.          Werner Siemens • could, while standing
on the top of one of the pyramids during a strong wind, charge an
improvised Leyden jar sufficiently to obtain strong sparks.                A casual
observation      of Elster and Geitel,f may prove significant. On
 -
March 7th, 1889, the temperature in Wolfenbiittel was rising from
     10° C. to + 2° C, a cirrus layer covering the sky.                 The fall of
potential changed in the course of four hours from 1302 volts per
metre to — 1200 volts, that is, from a very exceptionally high fall
to an equally strong gradient in the other direction.                Although the
atmospheric circumstances were anomalous, they seem not in them
selves sufficient to account for the anomalous electrical effects, and
the authors suggest that a possible explanation may be found in a
violent dust storm which on the previous day was observed in
Alexandria.
      Fogs are generally found to increase the normal fall considerably,
so that the drops of water must be taken as positively electrified.
      Waterfalls considerably disturb the electric condition in their
neighbourhood,       the air surrounding the fall being found charged
negatively sometimes to considerable distances.
      Whether clouds in themselves are always electrified is very
 doubtful ; they no doubt disturb and generally weaken the fall of
 potential at the earth's surface, but this may only be due to a dis
 placement of the positively-electrified layer which balloon observa
 tions have shown to exist at a height of from 10,000 feet to
 20,000 feet.      While a cloud discharges rain, the electrical effects in
 the neighbourhood of the place are the same as that in the neighbour
 hood of a waterfall. The explanation is probably the same in the
 two cases, and by means of experiments, alluded to further on, we
 may reproduce the negative electrification of air under similar
 circumstances.
      Measurements of the electrification of falling rain or snow, simple
 as they appear at first sight, are beset with very serious difficulty.
 We owe the most complete investigation on the point to Messrs.
 Elster and Geitel.J They find no regularity in the electrification,
 though positive signs slightly preponderate with snow and negative
 signs with rain.

cannot be an electrical effect, for electrical instruments delicate
enough to detect a small fraction of the normal force, give no indi
cations of the approach of a thunderstorm, and it is only when the
cloud has begun to discharge rain or hail that strong electrical effects
are noticed.    During the thunderstorm the electroscope is, of course,
much disturbed, and there are frequent and violent reversals of its
indications.*    The fact that no effects are observed at the surface of
the earth during the approach of a thunder-cloud does not prove that
there is no electrical separation, for we may imagine two oppositely
electrified layers at different levels producing a strong electric field
between them, but only weak effects outside.      That some such thing
may possibly occur is indicated by observations made in mountain
districts, where violent electrical disturbances are observed previous
to the formation of clouds. f The cumulus cloud, from which the
lightning strikes out, is nearly always associated with a cirrus layer
above     it,
           and the flash occurs more frequently upwards or sidewards
between the clouds than down to earth.       Under such circumstances
it    clear that instruments on the surface of the earth can only very

partially indicate the nature and distribution of electrical stress in the
neighbourhood        of the cloud.

     Dr. A. Wartmann gives to the Physical Society of Geneva the
following account of what he saw : * — At half-past six o'clock in the
                                                    "
evening     I  drove from Versoix to Genthoud.               On the Malagny Road
I  heard the coachman say he did not know where he was. His eyes
were so much fatigued by the frequent and intense lightning dis
charges, that he was blinded, and could not, even in the intervals,
see the road, in spite of the good lanterns alongside.               I  stepped on to
the box and took the reins.              We had barely passed the principal
gate of the grounds of Dr. Marcet, when I became conscious of a
bright and lasting luminosity behind me. Thinking it was a fire,                      I
turned round, and saw, at a distance of, roughly, 300 metres, a ball
of fire of about 40 cm. diameter. It travelled in our direction with
a velocity about equal to that of a bird of prey, and left no luminous
trail behind. Just as the ball had overtaken us, about 24 metres to
our right, it burst with a terrific noise, and it seemed to me as if lines
of fire started from it. We felt a violent shaking, and remained
blinded a few seconds. As soon as              I  regained power of distinguishing
objects,    I  saw    that  the  horses    had     turned at a right angle to the
carriage,   with    their chests in the   hedge,     with drooping ears and all signs
of great     terror.    I  returned   on   the   following day to the place where
I  had seen     the   ball  explode,    but   could    find no sign of any damage.
At    a distance     of 100 metres       I   found    that a group    of three trees,
bordering      a wood, had      their upper branches singed, but it is not
possible to say whether this was due to the discharge which                     I   had
seen."
      The following is a translation of an account given by Mr. H. W.
 Roth :| — " During the thunderstorm of May 19, 1888, at about 6 pjn.,
a flash of lightning took effect which seems to me remarkable from a
physiological point of view. The dealer Werner, from Ellerbruch, and
his son (16 years old), with a one-horse conveyance containing rags,
were on the road which leads from here to the village of Ottensen,
about three miles away in a south-westerly                   direction. The father
had been left a little behind, and the son was occupied in giving
 bread to the horses, when he found himself suddenly surrounded
 by light, and noticed a fiery ball, about the size of his fist, move
 towards him along the back of the horse.                   Then he lost conscious
 ness. He felt no concussion.             The father, on approaching, saw the
 horses' limbs still contracting, and at first he thought his son was
 dead, but succeeded, after considerable efforts, in bringing him back
 to life in about three-quarters of an hour.               The horse was dead."
      Some curious statistics have been collected, especially in Germany,
 as to the damage done by lightning flashes.                  That damage seems to

  although in cases of this kind statistics may easily be at fault, there
  seems no doubt about the reality of the fact, which may find an
  explanation in the partial cutting down of forests in those parts
  where thunderstorms chiefly occur.               When lightning strikes into
 forests, it selects certain trees by preference.            Thus, in the prin
  cipality of Lippe, taking the percentage of beeches struck by
 lightning as unity, that for other trees is as follows : — Oak 48,
  spruce fir 5, Scotch fir, 83.
       The St. Elmo's fire, a continuous discharge from points and sharp
 angles, is often observed on board ship and in mountain districts
 during a storm.           Its appearance was considered a sign of the
 approaching end of the lightning, and was looked upon with favour
 by the ancient sailors in the Mediterranean Sea, who gave to it the
 name of Castor and Pollux. There was another appearance called
 Helena, a bad omen, which by many is believed to have been another
 form of the St. Elmo's fire, and the present name has been stated to
 be a corruption of the word Helena. Some support is given to this
 view by the fact that the Emperor Constantino built a castle in the
 Pyrenees, which he named after his mother, Helena, and this castle
 seems to be referred to occasionally as St. Elne or St. Elme.             But it
 is much more probable, as argued by Dr. F. Piper,* that the word is
 derived from St. Erasmo, a bishop who came from Antiochia, and
 suffered a martyr's death at the beginning of the fourth century.            He
 seems to have been specially considered the patron of Italian sailors.
 Churches and castles in Naples and Malta were called St. Erasmo
 and St. Ermo, and Ariosto describes St. Elmo's fires as St. Ermo's
fires.     The electric discharge which goes under this name has a
different appearance according as it is the positive or negative elec
 tricity which escapes, and both kinds occur with about equal frequency.
       Although we have not yet arrived at any satisfactory theory of
atmospheric        electricity, some progress has been made, and this
account would not be complete without a short account of the views
taken by men of science on the subject.                  The number of theories
proposed      is very  considerable.      Dr.  Suclmland.t   in a pamphlet pub
lished in 1886, gives an account of twenty-four, to which he adds one
— his own. The year 1884 alone has given birth to four theories.
       We may group the theories according to the origin they assign to
the source of energy which is involved in the formation of the electrio
field. All the work we can perform is either derived from the sun
or from) the earth's rotation. There is, as far as             I  know, only ono
theory — that of Edlund — which makes the earth's rotation in space
responsible for the separation of electricities in the atmosphere. But
Edlund's views are not tenable in theory, and, even granting his

deductions, the normal fall of potential should, according to the
views of the author, have a different sign in the polar and equatorial
regions, which is contrary to the observed fact.         This theory does
not, however, exhaust the possibility of explaining atmospheric
electricity as a phenomenon of electromagnetic induction, and it is
not disproved that in some form or other the rotation of the earth's
magnetic field may play a part in the origin of the electric field. The
theories which take solar radiation as the source of the energy divide
themselves into several groups.      We may think of a direct thermo
electric or actinic action, but there is, so far, no experimental support
to such views.     One of the earliest and most natural suppositions is
the belief in evaporation as a source of electrification. This was
Volta's theory, and experiments have at various times been produced
in its support ; but, so far, no one has been able to invalidate
Faraday's conclusion that whenever electrification seemed to appear
as a consequence of evaporation, it was really due to secondary causes,
such as the friction of the liquid spray against the sides of the con
taining vessel. Rejecting Volta's theory, there is nothing left but
the belief in some form of contact or frictional electricity either
between drops of water and air, or water and ice, or any two of tho
various bodies present in the atmosphere.        The possibility of contact
electricity between a solid or liquid and a gas, is not quite easy to
submit to the test of experiment.    If we rub two solid bodies together,
we may, by separating them, investigate the electric field produced ;
but, supposing we have a drop of water surrounded on all sides by
air, the water may be covered with an electric layer of, say, positive
electricity, the air in contact with the water with the opposite kind,
and it is not at all clear how we could experimentally demonstrate
the difference of potential between the air and the drop which is thus
produced.     A current of air flowing past the drop might carry away
some of the negative layer, and in this way an electric field may be
established while clouds are forming, but the conditions necessary for
an experimental demonstration       would be very difficult to realise.
 Two methods have been devised which practically demonstrate some
form of contact electricity between gases and water.
     Lenard, wishing to imitate the electric field observed in the
 neighbourhood of waterfalls, has established by careful experiment a
 number of important facts, which are all consistent with the following
explanation.     If we imagine two oppositely electrified layers at the
 surface of a drop of water such as has been referred to, and if the
drop falls on to a layer of the same liquid, or if similar drops impinge
 on each other, the difference of potential produced by the fusion of
 the surface layers becomes greater than is consistent with equilibrium.
 For, taking the case of drops falling into a mass of water contained
 in a cylindrical vessel, the extent of surface between air and water is
 not increased by the falling drops, and we must imagine that surface
 to be already covered with a sufficient electrical sheet to establish the
 required difference of potential.    The electrification of the drops is,

 therefore,   not wanted, and a change in the distribution takes place.
  The natural supposition would be, that this equilibrium would be
 restored very quickly through the surface of the water, but a certain
 time seems to be required for this. Meanwhile, the strong current
 of air which in Lenard's experiments is brought down with the water
 drops carries some of the electricity away, the water remaining posi
 tive.   More recent experiments of Lord Kelvin's, with air bubbling
 through water, point similarly to contact forces between gases and
 liquids, and in these experiments also it appears that a considerable
time is required to establish electric equilibrium between a gas and a
 solid. Lenard finds very important differences caused by small im
 purities in the water, the water acting much more strongly when it
 is pure.    If it contains as much salt as is contained in the sea, the
 effect is reversed, and the air becomes positively electrified.  The ex
 planation which is given above is practically that of Lenard, whose
 observations have been confirmed and further extended by Prof.
 J. J. Thomson. These experiments, no doubt, account for the
 behaviour of air in the neighbourhood of waterfalls, and they pro
 bably also explain the negative electrification of air in the neighbour
 hood of districts in which rain is falling.           The strong positive
 electrification of mist may also be due to the same cause.
      There seems to be no doubt that the formation of a cloud is often
accompanied by electrical effects. A few years ago, descending from
the Dent Blanche,      I found myself, after sunset, at a height of about
 12,000 feet.     A current of air was apparently blowing up the valley
                                                           I
which stretches from Evolena towards Ferpecle, and could observe
a cloud condensing below me at a height a little less than the snow
line. As night came on, and we continued our descent over the
glacier and down the valley, a series of electric discharges were
noticed between the cloud, which was lying in a deep-cut valley, the
sides of the mountain, and the blue sky overhead.         Here the moist
air was evidently streaming through the cloud, depositing its moisture
in the form of drops, and it seemed the most natural explanation at
the time that the air left the cloud in an electrified state.
     But while by means of experiments we have been able to produce
some of the phenomena of atmospheric electricity, we have other
important effects which cannot be accounted for in so simple a way.
The electric discharges during a thunderstorm give evidence of
electric fields, which could hardly be explained by contact electricity
between drops of water and air alone.        The fact that thunderstorms
are nearly always connected with the formation of hail, and Faraday's
experiments showing that water rubbing against ice becomes nega
tively electrified, is made use of in the theories of Sohnke and Luvini.
It is quite likely that there is some truth in these theories. Their
weak point lies in the difficulty of seeing how particles of ice and
water can be first sufficiently mixed to allow of friction, and then
become sufficiently separated to produce an electric field of such
magnitude as we know must exist in a thunder cloud.

474                           Professor Arthur Schuster                    [Feb. 22,
    It is to be remarked, however, that the laws of contact electricity
must be applicable to gases as well as to solids, and that if water
becomes positive when rubbing against air, and negative when rub
bing against ice, there must be a strong contact difference between
ice and air.         In other words, it does not matter whether there is
direct friction between ice and water, or whether the air forms an
intermediate      body.     We may imagine air rising through a cloud
containing drops of water negatively electrified, and then passing
through an ice cloud having its negative electricity increased, thus
leaving the ice and water particles at a difference of potential which
may, by a fusion of the drops, increase sufficiently to produce a
lightning discharge.         This seems to the writer the most plausible
theory   which,   in   the  present state of our knowledge, can be formed.
As regards the permanent negative charge of the earth's surface, the
time has not yet arrived for forming a definite opinion.                  Although
we know that the earth, once electrified, would gradually lose its
charge into the atmosphere, yet we can express no opinion as to the
rate at which the loss is going on. That loss may be exceedingly
slow, and consequently equilibrium might be attained by a very
small preponderance of negative electricity brought back to its surface
through some cause or other. Rain, as has already been mentioned,
is more frequently electrified negatively than positively in our own
climate, and though we do not know how far this holds in the
tropical belt, it is at any rate possible that the surface of the earth
may in this way alone make up for the loss. We may also reasonably
think that Lenard's observation on salt water may account for the
permanent charge.          Every wave that breaks into spray under the
action of a strong wind would leave the water negatively electrified,
the air carrying away the positive charge.                  It would be of great
interest to possess observations on atmospheric electricity on board
ship while waves are breaking in the neighbourhood.                  So far we have
only  Exner's   observations      to guide us,  who    found,   while  observing at
Lavinia, in Ceylon, that the spray from breaking waves affected the
indications of the electrometer, proving its positive electrification.*
    But although the loss of electricity from the earth's surface may
be very slow, it is equally possible that it is considerable.              We shall
not be able to treat this question satisfactorily until we have some
clearer notion of the causes of the aurora.            We know that the aurora
 implies electric currents, and the circuit of these currents may lie
completely within the earth's atmosphere, and have nothing to do
with the observed fall of potential near the ground.                     It is also
possible  that   the   body  of  the earth  forms     part  of the electric circuit,
and if that is the case, there must be across different parts of the
surface an outward and inward flow of positive electricity.                  Such a
discharge could not fail to influence the phenomena we have discussed,
and it seems probable that we should have some evidence derived

 from observation if the aurora was always accompanied by discharges
 through the earth's surface.         Except in the polar regions, these
 aurorae do not seem to affect the normal fall of potential. There is a
 third view we may take as to the circulation of electric currents indi
 cated by the aurora : the return current may take place in space out
 side the earth's atmosphere.      A good deal might be said in favour of
 this view, and the rotation of the earth's magnetic field in space
 might be a sufficient cause for the production of these currents ; but
 this is not the place to enter further into this question.
     Calculations made from observation on the height of the aurora
 have generally resulted in an altitude of from 100 to 200 miles,
 except in the polar regions, where the aurora seems occasionally to
 descend to a much lower level.        It has also been noticed that aurora)
 are associated with certain bands of cirrus clouds, and this seems to
 indicate that although the luminous phenomenon is sufficiently
 intense to be observed at only great heights, yet the electric pheno
 mena may descend to the level of the cirrus.
     As regards the connection       between the aurora      and the sunspot
 period, further observations in the polar regions are needed. On the
 one hand, we have Paulsen's * statement, derived from observations in
 Greenland, to the effect that the greatest number of aurorae are seen
 when sunspots are at their minimum, that is, at a time when in our
own latitudes the number is smallest ; and, on the other hand, we
 have Nordenskiold's observations, which seem to point in the opposite
 direction. In a publication which contains much important matter
on the geographical distribution and form of the aurora borealis,
Nordenskiold contrasts the appearances he has observed in the Vega
during the winter of 1878-79, passed in the Behring Straits, with
that previously observed in 1872-73 to the north of Spitzbergen.
According to this author, the aurorae, during the minimum sunspot
period in 1878-79, were " hardly worthy of his notice by the side of
those observed in 1872-73."          But although only faintly luminous,
the aurorae of 1879 were persistent and regular in shape.             They did
not affect the magnetic field, and seem to show a regular and con
tinuous, though weak, electric discharge.           The arc and streamers in
1872 were much more brilliant and much more irregular.                    Some
objection may be raised against these observations, in so far as they
refer to different places, and local circumstances may have affected
the phenomenon ; but in the face of the very careful description he
gives us, we cannot as yet accept Paulsen's results without further
confirmation.
     The problem of atmospheric         electricity, like that of terrestrial
magnetism, presents special      features   in the arctic regions, and until
we possess a greater number of observations in those little accessible

parts of the earth's surface, many important problems cannot be satis
 factorily solved.  Arctic and antarctic expeditions are of interest to
scientific men, not because they care much whether we get a few miles
nearer the pole, but because a well-conducted party collects invaluable
information on its journey. Although much remains to be done in
 the regions surrounding the north magnetic pole, our knowledge in
 the southern hemisphere is almost disgracefully inadequate, and it is
to be hoped that before long a well-equipped expedition may fill up
to a certain extent the large gaps in our electrical and magnetical
knowledge which at present stop so many of our researches.
     But although investigations to be conducted in the Arctic regions
are of primary importance, we may do much nearer home in extend
ing and completing existing information. Instrumental appliances
and methods of observation, originally put into a satisfactory state
by Lord Kelvin, have been improved, especially by Mascart, Exner,
Elster and Geitel. One of our most crying wants at present is a
series of continuous observations by means of self-registering instru
ments in places where the neighbourhood         of a town, or other local
circumstances, do not interfere with the normal changes.             The
Greenwich Observatory, to whom we look for help in such matters,
is placed in the difficulty that the daily variations there observed are
markedly different from those in the majority of places, and it is
probable that the nearness of London is fatal to any generally useful
series of observations of atmospheric electricity being conducted in
our national Observatory.

                   The Physical Work      of von  Helmholtz.
The career we are to consider this evening was            a career of singular
                                                                        "
distinction.   In   days when the range of " natural knowledge             is so
vast that most workers are compelled to be content if they can add
something to one or two of the sub-divisions of one of the main
branches of science, von Helmholtz showed that it is not impos
sible to be at once a great mathematician,             a great experimental
physicist,  and,  in  the widest  sense of  the  term,  a great biologist.
     It was but eight months yesterday since he delivered his last
lecture ; it is six months to-day since he died, and the interval is
too short for us to attempt to decide on the exact place which will
be assigned to him by posterity ; but making all allowance for the
fact that each age is apt to place its own great among the greatest,
making all allowance for the spell which his name cast over many
of us in the lecture rooms where we ourselves first gained some
knowledge of science,      I  am sure that  I  only express the views of all
those who know his work best, when          I  say that we place him in the
very front rank of those who have led the great scientific movement
of our time. This opinion          I have now to justify.       I  must try to
convey to you    in  some   sixty minutes an outline of the work of more
than fifty strenuous years, to give you some idea of the wide range
of the multifold activities which were crowded into them, of the
marvellous insight with which the most diverse problems were
attacked and solved, and, if it may be, some image of the man him
self.   The task is impossible, and     I  can but attempt some fragments
of it.
      The history of von Helmholtz is in one respect a simple tale.
There are no life and death struggles with fate to record. His work
was not done with the wolf at the door, or while he himself was
wrestling with disease. He passed through no crises in which success
or failure, immortality or oblivion, seemed to depend on the casting
of a die. He suffered neither from poverty nor riches.               He was a
hale, strong man on whom external circumstances neither imposed
exceptional disabilities, nor conferred exceptional advantages, but

482                       Professor A. W. Biiclcer              [March 8,
who, by sheer force of the genius that was in him, passed on from
success to success till he was recognised by all as the admirable
Crichton of modern science, the most widely cultivated of all students
of nature, the acknowledged leader of German science, and one of
the first scientific men in the world.
     It is the more fitting that this evening should have been set aside
for the consideration of the work of Helmholtz, in that England may
claim some share in his greatness. Before her marriage his mother
bore an English name — Caroline Penn ; she was, as her name implied,
of English descent. His father was a Professor of Literature in the
Gymnasium at Potsdam, so that his early days were passed amid
that plain living and high thinking which are characteristic of in
tellectual circles in Germany.     The boy did well at school, and when
the time came for choosing a profession, his passion for mathematics
and physics had already developed itself.       The course of his love for
these sciences did not run quite smooth.       The path of his ambition
was crossed by the hard necessity which in some cases checks, in
others fosters, but in all chastens the aspirations of youth.      He had
to make his livelihood.     Science must be to him what the Germans
happily call a
                  " bread-study." Medicine offered a fair prospect of
prosperity. Physics, in those days, was but an intellectual pastime.
And so the young man took his father's advice, and became an army
doctor.     In this, as in so many other cases, " the path of duty was
the way to glory."
     It is possible that if von Helmholtz had been what — with a sad
consciousness of the limitations it implies —       I  may call a mere
physicist, he would have played a greater part in the development of
some of those subjects, the study of which he initiated or helped to
initiate, but did not thereafter pursue.      It is possible that had he
been a biologist, and nothing more, he would have followed up the
early investigation in which he dealt a blow at the theory that
putrefaction and fermentation are chemical processes only, clearly
indicating, if he did not actually demonstrate, that the decay which
follows death is due to an outburst of low forms of life.
     He might thus under other circumstances have done work for
which he showed his competence, but which is now chiefly associated
with other names ; but it is certain that without the unusual combina
tion of wonderful mathematical power and a professional knowledge
of anatomy, he would never have accomplished the special tasks
which it is his special glory to have achieved.
     His first three papers, however, hardly displayed the fusion
between his various powers which was afterwards so remarkable a
characteristic of his work. The first two were on biological subjects.
The third was the famous essay on the ' Conservation of Force.'          I
have told elsewhere the story of the dramatic circumstances under
which it was given to the world, of the interest it excited among the
members of the Physical Society of Berlin, the refusal of the editor of
Poggendorjf's Annalen to publish it, and the final triumph of the author

1895.]              on the  Physical Work of     von JlelmhoUz.                 483
and his views.*         Helmholtz was not, and did not claim to be an
original author of the doctrine of the conservation of energy ; but two
young men, Sir William Thomson in England, and Helmholtz in
Germany, independently, and within a month of each other, were
the first persons who compelled the scientific world to regard it
seriously.
      There is one interesting fact which connects this essay directly
with the Royal Institution.         Four years after it was published, it was
placed by Du Eois Reymond in the hands of one who was lost to
science in the same year as von Helmholtz himself — the late Prof.
Tyndall. He was much impressed, and has spoken of the incident
as bringing him face to face with the great doctrine of the " Conser
 vation of Energy." f He translated the essay into English, and for
many years made it his habit to place every physical paper published
by Helmholtz within the reach of English readers.
      And now, having brought you to the point at which Helmholtz
may be said to have been fairly started on his life's work, let me first
describe briefly his official career, before       I consider his achievements
in greater detail.
      When his extraordinary abilities became evident, he was permitted
to sever his connection with the army.            At twenty-seven years of ago
he became Teacher          of Anatomy     in  the Academy of Arts at Berlin.
In the next year he was appointed Professor of Anatomy and Physio
logy at Eonigsberg, and he held similar posts in the Universities of
Bonn (1855-58) and Heidelberg (1858-71).                   It was not till 1871
that his early love for physics was finally rewarded.             When the chair
of Physics was to be filled in the University of the newly-founded
German Empire, in Berlin, it was felt that even in Germany — the
land of specialists — no better occupant could be found than one who
was then in his fiftieth year, and who had been all his life a teacher
of anatomy and physiology. The choice was universally approved
and completely justified, and von Helmholtz held this post till his
death.
     In this    connection    I am, by the kindness of Sir Henry Roscoe,
enabled      to  show to you a relic of remarkable interest.                It is a
photograph of the great teacher and investigator, taken at the very
last lecture that he delivered — that, namely, on July 7, 1894.
     For some years, that is, from the date of its foundation, von
Helmholtz was the president of the Physikalisch-Technische Reichs-
Anstalt in Charlottenburg.          This institution, founded partly by the
munificence      of the late  Dr. Werner Siemens, partly by funds supplied
by the State, has no precise analogue in this country.               It is devoted
to the carrying out of systematic researches on questions of funda
mental importance to which a long time must be devoted.

     The most characteristic work of Helmholtz was, as have already
hinted, that in which his knowledge of physics and his knowledge of
anatomy were both directed to a common end.       He dealt in turns with
the external physical phenomena, with the mechanism of the organs
which the phenomena affect, with the relations between the mechanical
effect on the organ and the sensations which it excites, and, lastly, with
the connection between the sensations in those simple cases which
can alone be investigated in the laboratory, and the complex laws of
aesthetics and art.
     The two books in which these problems were chiefly treated were
the ' Physiological Optics,' and the ' Sensations of Sound.'     It is im
possible to do more than lay before you a sample which may afford
some idea of the intricacy of the problems with which he dealt, and
of the pitfalls amongst which he walked so warily. For this purpose
I  have chosen one branch of his work on ' Sound.'
     I have deliberately selected that particular portion which has
been most questioned, that on which the verdict of most of those who
have sat in judgment on his views has been against him.
     In discussing this question  I must give a general description of
the principle phenomena ; but if      I were to attempt an exhaustive
catalogue of all the facts disputed and undisputed, and of all the
theories which have been based upon or upset by them, not only
would time fail me, but those who have not given special attention to
the subject would,   I fear, become hopelessly confused amid the chaos
of opposing statements and views. Another reason which urges me
to be brief, is that a few years ago Prof. Silvanus Thompson explained
the whole subject to the members of the ltoyal Institution, having
kindly consented to act as the mouthpiece of the celebrated in
 strument maker, Konig, who has played so large a part in these
controversies.
     Among the chief achievements of Helmholtz was an explanation
of the physical difference between pairs of notes which we recognise
as concords and discords respectively.         When two neighbouring
notes are sounded, alternate swellings and fallings off of the intensity
are heard. which are called beats. These produce an unpleasant
effect, which depends partly on their number, partly on the relative
pitches . of the beating notes. When two notes beat badly, they
form an intolerable discord.       When they become separated by a
wider interval, the beats are so rapid that they cease to be un
pleasant.
     The sense of dissonance produced by many of theso wider intervals,
such as the seventh (4 : 7), requires further explanation.     In general,
the fundamental musical note is only the first and loudest of a series
of so-called partials, whose vibration frequencies are 2, 3, 4, &c. times
that of the fundamental, and the consonance and dissonance of two
notes is shown to depend on the presence or absence of beats between
important members of these series. Thus in the case of the seventh
the frequencies of the octave of the lower note and that of the upper

                  on the Physical Work of  von Helmholtz.             485
note would be in the proportion 8 : 7, which are sufficiently near to
make the beats very prominent and disturbing.
     In cases where the notes are pure, that is, are not accompanied by
upper partials, the explanation of dissonance is based upon another
phenomenon.
     When two notes are sounded simultaneously a third tone is often
perceived, the frequency of which is equal to the difference of their
frequencies.     The number of vibrations of this tone is equal to the
number of beats, and as there has been controversy as to whether the
beats when they become rapid can produce a note, and if so, whether
this note is or is not the same thing as the difference tone, it is neces
sary to distinguish between the two. This distinction is to be found
in the mode of their production ; but for the moment it is sufficient
to remember that they may be distinguishable, and to reserve for
them two names, viz. the beat-note, and the first difference tone
respectively.
     Helmholtz drew attention to the fact that besides the differ
ence tone there is also produced a note, the frequency of which is
equal to the sum of those of the two primaries, and this he called the
first summation tone.
     Together with these he believed that there existed summation and
difference tones of higher orders, the whole series being included
under the name of combination tones. Our sense of dissonance
between pure notes was explained as dependent on beats produced by
the combination tones.
     Up to the time of Helmholtz it was generally thought that these
tones were produced in the ear itself, and had no objective existence
in the external air. They are thus often called subjective, but as that
adjective is usually reserved for impressions produced in the brain
itself, it is better to say that they were regarded as ear-made. Helm
holtz himself gave a theory, which showed that it is probable that a
membrane like the drum-skin of the ear, which is forced out of shape
by pressure, and that bones, like those in the ear, which can rattle,
would, if acted upon by two notes, manufacture by their own proper
movements all the varied combinational tones which his theory
postulated.     He therefore believed that combinational tones were
largely ear-made.
    .You will observe that his theory of discord is quite unaffected by
the question whether the combination tones are or are not sometimes
objective.    Provided only they are produced at all, it is immaterial
whether they are produced in the ear itself. Von Helmholtz admitted
that the phenomena we observe are in most cases ear-made tones;
but he also asserted that they were sometimes objective, and could
set bodies tuned to vibrate with them in resonant motion.     This latter
statement has been denied with singular unanimity, sometimes,            I
think, without due regard to the limitations which Helmholtz himself
placed on the conditions under which the objective character of tho
notes can be realised.

486                           Professor A. W. Racker                      [March   8,
      All ordinary calculations as to the production and mingling of
different waves of sound are based upon the supposition that the
displacements of the particles of air, or other body through which
the sound is travelling, are very small.            If this is so, the force which
tends to restore each disturbed particle to its ordinary position of
equilibrium is accurately proportional to the amount of the displace
ment.
      In  von Helmholtz' view, objective combination tones were in
general     produced when the disturbance was so great that this con
dition was no longer fulfilled.            Violence is of the essence of the
explanation.        Hence the siren, where both sets of holes open into the
same small wind chest — the harmonium, in which two reeds alternately
close and open slits in the same enclosure, are the instruments best
suited to produce them.            Of these the siren is the more efficient.
Von      Helmholtz     convinced    himself that the combination tones pro
duced by        the   harmonium      are for the most part ear-made.             He
expressly stated that
                            " when the places in which the two tones are
struck are entirely separate and have no mechanical connection, as,
for example, if they come from two singers, two separate wind
                                   "
instruments, or two violins — to which we may add two tuning-forks
— " the reinforcement of the combinational tones by resonators is
small and dubious." *
      Now this reinforcement by resonators has been altogether denied
by   most   of those who have taken an interest in the matter, while, if
an exception is allowed, it is in favour of the beats of a disturbed
unison, the observed effects being ascribed to the beats, and not to
the difference tone.
      Some writers make no exception whatever in their denial of the
 objective reality of what may be broadly termed secondary tones.
 Thus Mr. Bosanquet, who made a most careful series of experiments
some fourteen years ago, stated that " the ordinary first difference
 tone    ...   is not capable of exciting a resonator.           ...   In short, the
 difference tone of Helmholtz         ...    as ordinarily heard, is not objective
 in its character." f
      Prof. Preyer, too, using very sensitive tuning-forks, found that
 the differential tone given by two forks did not affect a fork the
 frequency of which corresponded with its own, except in cases where
  the difference tone was itself a partial of one of the forks.
       It must be remembered that the assertions of Helmholtz as to the
  experimental proof of the objective nature of the tones were made
 with reference to those instruments which he regarded as most likely
 to produce objective notes, viz. the siren and the harmonium, and that,
 therefore, experiments with forks hardly affect his position.
       Let us now try with the siren whether it is possible to confirm or
 to disprove the validity of his views.

     For this purpose the rather bulky
apparatus which you soe before you has
been constructed.       Ishould hardly have
been able to realise the idea embodied in
it, at all events in time to show      to you
                                      it
this evening, if  I had not been favourably
situated in two respects. In the first place
I  have had the zealous co-operation of one
of my assistants, Mr. Edwin Edser, who
has not only made all the parts of the
apparatus that required to be newly made,
but has thrown himself into the investiga
tion with the utmost energy, working at        it
late and early, and making many valuable
suggestions and improvements.         In our
joint work we have been helped by some
of my senior students, and notably by
Messrs. Cullen and Forsyth.           In the
second place, I  have had at my disposal the
magnificent collection of acoustical appa
ratus in the National Museum at South
Kensington, some of which am allowed, by
                              I
the kindness of the Department of Science
and Art, to bring here this evening.
     The essential part of the apparatus
is   a tuning-fork    F, to one prong of
which    isattached    mirror M, and to the
                       a
other square of thin wood, strengthened
      a
by ribs, which    is of the same weight as
the mirror.     The fork thus loaded has
been compared with one of Konig's large
standards by means of Lissajous' figures.
Its frequency does not differ from 64
complete vibrations per second by more
than one vibration in two minutes.        The
shank is supported by         mass of lead,
                              a
which in turn     is placed upon     apaving-
stone.    Upon this stono also rest the other
 mirrors necessary for producing Michel-
 son's interference bands.      The mirror M:
 is silvered so thinly that half the light
 which falls upon  it  is reflected, and half is
 transmitted.
     A ray proceeding from the lantern         L
 will be divided at Mi into two, which fol
low the paths LM1M:iM1B and LM^MMiB
respectively.    Interference bands are thus produced which can be pro
jected on to screen, so as to be rendered visible to large audience.

     If  the prong of the tuning-fork moves through the eighty-
thousandth of an inch, that is, through a distance equal to a half
wave-length of light, the path of the ray which falls upon it is
shortened by a whole wave-length, and the position of each band is
shifted to that previously held by its neighbour.     If the fork vibrates
with an amplitude of this almost infinitesimal        amount,   the bands
will disappear, or will alternately appear and disappear according to
circumstances.      The fork may therefore be used to detect by reson
ance the presence of vibrations, the frequency of which is 64 per second.
    A priori, there were two difficulties of opposite kinds which made
it doubtful whether the fork would be an efficient weapon for the
purpose for which it was to be used.
     In the first place it would feel tremors of any sort, and it was
doubtful whether it would be possible to discriminate between mere
shakes and the vibrations which were to be studied.        This difficulty
has been very largely overcome.
     The table on which the apparatus stands rests on india-rubber.
 On the table are a pair of library steps ; these support two pieces of
 wood, which are heavily weighted and rest on india-rubber balls.
 From these two beams hang steel wires, which carry india-rubber
 door-fasteners, and these in turn support two rods on which the
 paving-stone is placed.     By this alternation of elastic and of heavy
 bodies we can make the bands absolutely steady, unless the disturb
 ances are violent.    The quiet movements necessary for working the
 apparatus,   the blowing of the bellows, and the like, produce no effect.
 On the other hand, the shutting of a door in a distant part of the
 building, the rumble of a cart in the street, will cause the bands to
 disappear.     A great deal of the work on which we rely has been
 done at South Kensington between midnight and three o'clock in
 the morning. Trustworthy observations have indeed been made at
 other times, but it is only in the still small hours that the apparatus
 is at its best.
      The second doubt was of a different kind.    It was certain that the
 instrument would be more or less shaken ; it was not quite certain
 whether the fork would respond to vibrations of the given period.
 It is easy to set a tuning-fork in vibration by resonance when it is
 mounted on a sounding box, but in that case the vibrations of the
 enclosed mass of air are communicated through the box to the fork.
 When the stalk of the fork is held rigidly, a tuning-fork is notoriously
 difficult to excite by resonance. This objection is, of course, to some
 extent counterbalanced      by the extraordinary sensitiveness of the
 means of detecting the vibrations, but it is necessary to supplement
 this by other devices. The instrument used is a siren (S). In front
 of it is placed a hollow wooden pyramid, the narrow end of which is
 near to, and is of the same area as the wooden plate attached to the
 tuning-fork.     This serves to collect the waves of sound and to con
 centrate them on the fork. Behind the siren is a large resonator by
 Konig, timed to respond to 64 vibrations per second.

1895.]           on the     Physical Work of   von Helmholtz.             489
       In some respects the apparatus requires careful handling. Of
  course if you blow down the connecting cone the fork may be dis
  turbed, and sometimes a particular note of the siren appears to affect
 the fork for no very obvious reason.            Probably the resonance of the
 air in the cone, or the vibrations of the wooden disc, may at times be
 the causes of such effects.        We have, however, found that whatever
 they may     be  due to, they  differ  in appearance from those produced by
 vibrations synchronous       with   the  periodic time of the fork, and they
 can in general be got         rid  of by a very slight readjustment of the
 apparatus.      The fact that our main conclusions do not depend on any
 such nicety, is proved by the fact that the instrument has been set up
 twice in the laboratory, and once in the lecture room in the College.
 In each case all the experiments have been successful, and on one oc
 casion only were we troubled by a disturbance due to a note (of about
 253 vibrations) when sounded alone.               A slight readjustment of the
 cone, however, eliminated this effect entirely.
      Such difficulties make it no easy matter to set up the apparatus in
a hurry, and the most       I can hope to do this evening is to demonstrate
 to you the methods of using it.        I       cannot undertake to make the
 actual measurements before yon.
      It is, however, desirable to illustrate the sensitiveness of the
 apparatus to vibrations of 61 per second, and its insensitiveness to
 other sounds.
      Provided the current of air does not travel directly down the cone,
organ pipes may be blown just outside it without producing any
effect. One of Konig's large tuning-forks may bo bowed strongly
without effect.
      If, however, the exciting fork be tuned to 64 vibrations per second,
and if it be struck as lightly as possible with the handle of a small
gimlet, used as a hammer, the handle having been previously covered
with india-rubber, the bands will imemdiately vanish, though the note
produced is often quite inaudible, even to a person whose ear is
placed close to the fork.
     Let the weights on the fork be shifted so that it makes 63*5
vibrations per second, then the resonating fork beats, and the bands
regularly appear and disappear every two seconds.
     Having thus explained the construction and working of the appa
ratus, let me show you how we have tested whether it responds to a
different tone.     When the proper rows of holes are opened, the siren
will give simultaneously the c' of 256 and the e' of 320 vibrations.
The interval is a major third, the difference tone is 64 vibrations.
The pitch is determined by the beats between the upper note and a
standard tuning-fork which gives e'.             Sounding the upper note alone
no effect is produced on the           interference   bands, as the beats first
appear, then die out, and are finally heard again when the note given
by the siren is too high.
    It    could be shown in like manner that the 256-noto alono pro
duces no effect, but  if,   when the standard fork of 320 vibrations and

450                         Professor A. W. Bucker                [March 8,
the upper note of the siren are judged to be in exact accord, the 256-
note be also produced, the bands immediately disappear.         Sometimes,
of course, a small error is made in the estimate of the pitch, and the
effect is not instantaneous, but in every case the bands disappear
when the beats between the two notes are so slow that they cannot be
distinguished.
     It is therefore evident that Helmholtz was right when he asserted
that the difference tone given by the siren is objective.          It exists
outside   the  ear, for it can move  a tuning-fork.
     Konig has shown that in many cases, when two notes are sounded
simultaneously beats are heard, as though the most prominent
phenomenon was the production of beats not between the two funda
mental notes, but between the upper of these and the nearest partial
of the lower note. Inasmuch as these beats are heard when the
lower note (as far as can be tested) is free from upper partials,
this rule is not the explanation of the phenomenon, but it is a con
venient way of expressing the results. In the experiment just de
scribed, the frequencies of the two notes were in the ratio 12 to 15.
The first partial of the lower note (12) is therefore the nearest to the
higher tone ; that is to say, KOnig's beat tone and the first difference
tone are identical.
     It is easy to arrange an experiment in which these conditions are
not fulfilled.    Thus let the notes be in the ratio 9 : 15. The second
partial of the lower note is 18, which is nearer to 15 than to 9 ; hence
the Konig beat-tone would have a relative frequency of 18- 15 = 3.
If  the siren rotates 10-6 times per second, the frequencies of the two
fundamental notes are 9x10*6 = 96 and 15x10*6 = 160 respectively.
As before, the difference tone is 64.
      In this case we can use another method of determining the speed of
 the siren.     In 1880 Lord Rayleigh constructed an instrument in
 which the mass of air enclosed in a tube is excited by resonance, and
 the fact of the excitation is indicated by a light mirror, which is set
 where the motion is greatest, inclined at 45° to the direction of the
air currents. In accordance with the general law that a lamina tends
to place itself perpendicular to the direction of a stream, the mirror
 moves when the air vibrates.       In the original apparatus the amount
 of the movement was controlled by magnets. Since that date Prof.
 Boys has modified the instrument by substituting a quartz thread
 suspension for a silk fibre, and using the torsion of the thread instead
of the directing force of the magnets. In a lecture delivered before
 the British Association, in Leeds, he exhibited the apparatus, which
 is sometimes called a mirror resonator.        Prof. Boys has been good
 enough to make two of these instruments for me, and for reasons
 which   I will not at the moment enter into, we decided that one of
 them should respond to 161 vibrations per second.           It so happens
 that   this  coincides    almost  exactly with   the frequency of one of
 tho notes in the experiment under discussion (160).             It is thus
 possible to use the mirror resonator as an auxiliary instrument to

  test the speed of the siren.             When the proper note is reached the
  spot of light will move, and if the difference tone is objective the
  interference bands ought to disappear simultaneously.                          We tried this
  experiment several times.             An observer so placed that he could not
  see the interference        bands, lifted his hand when the spot of light
  moved.        It was quite extraordinary to note the absolute agreement
  between his movements and the behaviour of the bands.
     By throwing the spot of light and the bands near together on the
  screen, the coincidence can be watched by a number of persons.                               We
  have   tried     whether  the   difference      tone   is  objective   in   four    cases,   and
  in all have detected it by the disappearance of the interference bands.
  The details of the experiments are collected in the following table.

      Of    course the question at once arises whether, when it can be
 distinguished separately, Konig's beat tone is also objective.                               I  do
 not wish to express a final opinion on this point, but                       I   may say that
 when the rows of eight and eighteen holes were opened, the speed of
 the siren was increased till the notes corresponding to 256 and 576
 vibrations were produced.               Konig's note would in that case have a
frequency of 576 — 2 x 256 = 64. We tried twice to obtain this. On
 the second occasion, especially, all the conditions were favourable,
 and the experiment was carried on for a long time. On neither
occasion did we obtain the smallest sign of an effect on the fork and
interference bands.
      We must next turn to the summation tone which Helmholtz dis
covered.          It has been almost universally denied that this note is
objective. Without going into details, it is only necessary to remark
that the late Mr. Ellis, the translator of the ' Tonempfindungen,'
who took a dispassionate view of the controversy, thought that the
position assumed by Helmholtz had been disproved.                                To the state
ment     of   Helmholtz     that   " it  was    formerly      believed  that     the combina
tional     tones     were   purely subjective         and     were   produced in the ear
itself," Ellis appended          the  note  :
                                                 " the result of Mr. Bosanquet's and
Prof. Preyer's quite recent experiments is to show that they are so."

492                           Professor A. W. Sucker                       [March 8,
    In an experiment on the summation tone, as the total number of
vibrations must not exceed 64, the notes will be too low to be well
heard.      I
            shall therefore use a third method of determining the rate
of speed of the siren. A mirror attached to the lower plate of the
instrument rotates with it. Concentric with, and lying on this, is a
circle of paper with eighteen cogs. Light reflected from the mirror
passes through holes in two pieces of tinfoil attached to the prongs
of a tuning-fork. When the fork is at rest, these holes are super
posed ; but when the fork vibrates, they move apart, are closed by
the tinfoil, and only cross each other twice in each complete vibration.
The tuning-fork makes 27-2 vibrations per second, and thus allows
the light to pass 54*4 times per second. But when the siren makes
3 -048 revolutions per second, the rows of nine and twelve holes
give a summation tone of 64 vibrations, and each cog moves over
18x3- 048 = 54 • 9, or say 55 times the distance between two con
secutive cogs.     If the wheel were viewed 55 times a second, the
cogs  would   appear stationary, as in that interval each would be
replaced by the next.      As they are really seen about 54 - 4 times a
second, they appear to move slowly forwards at the rate of about one
interspace in two seconds.      When this speed is attained the bands
disappear, thus proving the objective exsistence of the summation
tone.
    We have repeated this observation in various ways, and always
with success. The results are summed up in the table.
    It perhaps, drawback that all the notes in these experiments
          is,            a
are very low. In order to remedy this, and also to put the matter
to the test by means of another instrument, we have employed a
mirror resonator which responds to 576 vibrations per second.
    The rows of 15 and 12 holes being opened, notes of 320 and 256
vibrations were produced.   When they were sounded separately, the
noise seemed just to make the resonator move. When they were
sounded together, the spot of light was driven off the scale, when the
upper note coincided with that of    320-vibration fork, but immedi

     I venture       to think      that these experiments prove the accuracy of
von Helmholtz.            They    show     that the siren, at all events, does produce
objective tones,        the   frequencies of which coincide with those of the
first difference and summation tones, and that this statement is valid
as regards the difference tone, whether it is or is not coincident with
Konig's beat tone.
     I  have now in one single case tried to convey to you some idea of
the complexity of the problems with which von Helmholtz dealt.
He was the first man who detected a relation between the surging
mass of partials and combination tones and our sensations of concord
and discord.          The main facts of his theory are,            I   believe, generally
accepted.        On    some    points    modern    opinion   has  tended    to stray from
his views ; one of these we have studied afresh this evening.
                                    I
     It was the fact that had to deliver this discourse which led me
to investigate the question anew, and therefore                    I   felt bound to tell
you the results we have at present attained.                      Had it not been for
this,  I   should not have published . them as yet. We have several
improvements of the apparatus in view. We do not pretend to have
covered the field.          I   do not, therefore, wish to generalise.          My object
has been to refute hasty generalisations.                    I  am content if      I  have
convinced you,           as   I   have     convinced    myself,   that   Helmholtz      was
correct in stating that the siren produces objective tones whose
frequencies are equal to the sum and difference of their primaries,
and that the methods we have employed have brought to light no
facts opposed to his view that these notes cannot be explained as
secondary effects of partials, but as phenomena of the first order—in
other words, as real combination tones.
     But brief space now remains to discuss the vast remainder of his
                   I
work, and as have already published an appreciation of that,* must                  I
content myself with trying to give you, in a few sentences, some idea
of the range of his intellect.

on sound.     He invented the ophthalmoscope, by which the oculist
can study the inmost recesses of the eye.          The theory of colour
vision, the theory of binocular vision, the curious subjective effects
which are produced when we deliberately deceive our own senses by
the stereoscope ; these subjects he made especially his own.
    In the field of mathematics, he was the first to define the peculiar
rotatory motion of a liquid known as vortex-motion.            Great men
had laid the foundations of hydrodynamics before him, but all
had overlooked the importance and laws of the vortex.           Since the
memoir of Helmholtz was published, the subject has been widely
studied.    Lord Kelvin has originated the famous vortex-ring theory
of matter ; Prof. Fitzgerald has suggested that the ether may be a
complex of vortices, or, as it has been called, a vortex-sponge.
    On electricity he wrote much — on the theory of the galvanic cell,
on electrolysis, on electromagnetism.
    In England, at all events, we give the preference, as regards the
last subject, to the theory and writings of our own Maxwell.
    As   I have already said, von Helmholtz, in an age of specialists,
was a universal genius.     His intellect could light on nothing which
it did not illuminate. Hence, his opinions on side issues are of more
than ordinary importance, his " obiter dicta " are worth attention, his
popular lectures acquire a special interest.    Let us for a few moments
turn to these.
    The watchword of Helmholtz in dealing with educational
problems, is
               " freedom." Freedom for the student, freedom for the
teacher.
    In England, we are fond of insisting that there are certain things
which everybody who aspires to academic rank must know; of
hedging in our students by prescribed courses of study.         We make
them feel that general culture is an iron-bound safe, which they must
wrench open before they can attain the gem of real knowledge, rather
than a setting, without which the most profound acquirements seem
unattractive and dull.     Yet von Helmholtz, one of the most highly
educated men, one of the most comprehensive geniuses of the latter
end of the century, will have no set courses, except as a preparation
for a definite profession, is proud that Germany has " retained the
old conception of students, as that of young men responsible to
themselves, striving after science of their own free will, to whom it
is left to arrange their own plan of studies as they think best."
Not content with having made the attainment of this ideal almost
impossible for English students, doctrinaire educationalists are now
beginning to throw their net around the teacher. It is claimed that
as the student must go through a prescribed course of study in order
to learn, so the teacher must be drilled and examined before he is
allowed to teach.     Whatever can be said for this plan as regards the
less advanced class of teachers, who are to devote themselves to the
instruction of children — and in this case   I believe there is something
to be said for it — it is quite opposed to von Helmholtz' view of

1895.]            on the   Physical Work of von Helmholtz.            495
what    is best when the teaching is of university rank, and the
students are men and women.         Make it easy for whoever has given
some proof of knowledge, and wants to teach, to try his hand ; make
it easy for the student to go to the teacher from whom he gains the
most. Look for the best educational results, not necessarily from the
best lecturer, but from the man who is in closest contact with his
subject.   Do not force your teacher on his audience, but do all you
can to establish a bond of sympathy between them.            Trust, in a
word, to the free play of living forces, and not to the hampering
                                        " and "
restrictions of " necessary subjects              compulsory lectures."
This is a paraphrase of the views which Helmholtz held, and he
illustrated them by the history of this Institution itself.
       I
     " have often," he said, " wondered that the Royal Institution of
London, a private society which provides for its members and others
short courses of lectures on the progress of natural science, should
have been able to retain permanently the services of men of such
scientific importance as Humphry Davy and Faraday.            It was no
question of great emoluments ; these men were manifestly attracted
by a select public, consisting of men and women of independent
mental culture."      And then he goes on to show that in a German
university   the  teacher is attracted to his work, because he has to
deal with a body of students who are capable of forming opinions,
and of judging what is best for themselves.
     And this leads us to another point. Von Helmholtz insisted that it
is useless and dangerous to crowd the universities with students who
are not capable of taking advantage of the opportunities they offer.
" The majority of students," he says, " must come to us with a
sufficiently logically trained judgment, with a sufficient habit of
mental exertion, and with a taste sufficiently developed on the best
models to be able to discriminate truth from the bubbling appearance
of truth   ....  It would be very dangerous for the universities if large
numbers of students frequented them who were less developed in
[these] respects.    The general self-respect of the students must not
be allowed to sink.        If
                            that were the case, the dangers of academic
freedom would choke its blessings. It must, therefore, not be looked
upon as pedantry, or arrogance, if the universities are scrupulous in the
admission of students of a different style of education.        It would
be still more dangerous         if,
                               for any extraneous reasons, teachers were
introduced into the faculty who have not the complete qualifications
of an independent academeal teacher." *
     It would be out of place on this occasion to attempt to apply these
views to existing circumstances in London but with the knowledge
                                                        ;
that the final constitution of a Teaching University for the metropolis
may be decided within the next few months,          cannot but feel that

496              On the Physical Work  of von Helmholtz.      [March 8,
the wise determination of the Gresham Commissioners to include in
the university only institutions of university rank, can be maintained
against the attacks which will be made upon it.
     Lastly, I wish to defend the memory of von Helmholtz from a
possible misconception.    Those who cultivate art may perhaps look
upon him as the poet or the master of style look upon the grammarian ;
as a mere gerund-grinder, occupied with the study of the dead materials
which they alone can use. Of course Helmholtz was not a great artist
in the sense that he was a great scientific man, but it would be most
unfair to picture him as interested only in the study of law, and as
insensitive to beauty ; as occupied with sound and light, but careless
as to music and painting.     I could quote passage after passage from
his works to prove his keen sense of the loveliness as well as of the
order of nature, to show the homage that he paid, and the freedom he
accorded to art.    His object was not to lead art captive to science,
but rather to unite them in an alliance of mutual confidence and
support.
     " The horizons of physics, philosophy, and art," he said, " have
been too widely separated, and, as a consequence, the language, the
methods, and the aims of any one of these studies presents a certain
amount of difficulty for the student of any other of them." To smooth
away these difficulties, to bridge over the separating gulf, to supply
the common language, were the objects of the life work of von
Helmholtz. It was a noble ideal, nobly pursued, and crowned with as
much success as could reward the efforts of one man.      It is an ideal
akin to that which dominates this Institution, where science, litera
 ture and art are all heard in turns.
     If it is possible to sum up in a sentence the teaching of von
 Helmholtz, and the work of his life, it is that, in spite of the
 apparent diversities between science and science, between science,
 philosophy and art there is a fundamental unity, and that the
 future is for those who detect, amid the seeming discords of the
 schools, the true harmony which underlies and dominates them all.

The study of metals possesses an irresistible charm for us, quite
apart from its vast national importance.           How many of us made our
first scientific experiment by watching the melting of lead, little
thinking that we should hardly have done a bad life's work if the
experiment had been our last, provided we had only understood its
full significance.     How few of us forget that we wistfully observed at
an early age the melting in an ordinary fire of some metallic toy of
our childhood ; and such an experiment has, like the " Flat iron for a
farthing," in Mrs. Ewing's charming story, taken a prominent place in
literature which claims to be written for the young.             Hans Andersen's
fairy tale, for instance, the " History of a Tin Soldier," has been read
by children of all ages and of most nations.           The romantic incidents
of the soldier's eventful career need not be dwelt upon ; but                I may
remind you that at its end he perished in the flames of an ordinary
fire, and all that could subsequently be found of him was a small heart-
shaped mass.       There is no reason to doubt the perfect accuracy of
the story recorded by Andersen, who at least knew the facts, though
his statement is made in popular language. No analysis is given of
the tin soldier ; in a fairy tale it would have been out of place, but
the latest stage of his evolution is described, and the record is sufficient
to enable us to form the opinion that he was composed of both tin and
lead, certain alloys of which metals will burn to ashes like tinder.
His uniform was doubtless richly ornamented with gold lace. Some
small amount of one of the rarer metals had probably — for on this
point the history is silent — found its way into his constitution, and
by uniting with the gold, formed the heart-shaped mass which the
fire would not melt, as its temperature could not have exceeded
1000° C. ; for we are told that the golden rose, worn by the artiste
who shared the soldier's fate, was also found unmelted.                  The main

498                 Professor W. Chandler Roberts-Austen              [March 15,
point is, however, that the presence of one of the rarer metals must
have endued the soldier with his singular endurance, and in the end
left an incorruptible record of him.
     This incident has been taken as the starting-point of the lecture,
because we shall see that the ordinary metals so often owe remarkable
qualities to the presence of a rarer metal which fits them for special
work.
     This early love of metals is implanted in us as part of our " un-
squandered heritage of sentiments and ideals which has come down to
us from other ages," but future generations of children will know far
more than we did ; for the attempt will be made to teach them that
even psychology is a branch of molecular physics, and they will
therefore see much more in the melted toy than a shapeless mass of tin
and lead.      It is really not an inert thing ; for some time after it was
newly cast, it was the scene of intense molecular activity. It probably
is never molecularly quiescent, and a slight elevation of temperature
will excite in it rapid atomic movement anew. The nature of such
movement       I have indicated on previous occasions when, as now,            I
have tried to interest you in certain properties of metals and alloys.
                      I
     This evening appeal incidentally to higher feelings than interest,
by bringing before you certain phases in the life-history of metals
which may lead you to a generous appreciation of the many excellent
qualities they possess.
     Metals have been sadly misunderstood.          In the belief that animate
beings are more interesting, experimenters have neglected metals, while
no form of matter in which life can be recognised is thought to be
too humble to receive encouragement.           Thus it is that bacteria, with
repulsive attributes and criminal instincts, are petted and watched
with solicitude, and comprehensive schemes are submitted to the
Royal Society for their development, culture, and even for their
"education,"* which may, it is true, ultimately make them useful
metallurgical agents, as certain micro-organisms have already proved
their ability to produce arseniuretted hydrogen from oxide of arsenic.f
     It will not be difficult to show that methods which have proved
so fruitful in results when applied to the study of living things, are
singularly applicable to metals and alloys, which really present close
analogies to living organisms.         This must be a new view to many,
and it may be said, " it is well known that uneducated races tend to
personify or animate external nature," and it is strange, therefore, to
attempt, before a cultured audience, to trace analogies which must
appear to be remote, between moving organisms and inert alloys, but
" the greater the number of attributes that attach to anything, the
more real that thing is." % Many of the less known metals are very

real to me, and    I  want them to be so to yon ; listen to me, then, as
speaking for my      silent  metallic friends, while     I try to secure for them
your sympathy, esteem and intuitive perception of their beauty.
     First, as regards their origin and early history.              I fully share
Mr. Lockyer's belief as to their origin, and think that a future
generation will speak of tbe evolution of metals as we now do of that
of animals, and that observers will naturally turn to the sun as the
field in which this evolution can best be studied.
     To the alchemists metals were almost sentient ; they treated them
as if they were living beings, and had an elaborate pharmacopoeia of
" medicines " which they freely administered to metals in the hope of
perfecting their constitution.           If the alchemists constantly drew
parallels between living things and metals, it is not because they wore
ignorant, but because they recognised in metals the possession of
attributes which closely resemble those of organisms.              " The first al
chemists were gnostics, and the old beliefs of Egypt blended with
those of Chaldea in the second and third centuries.               The old metals
of the Egyptians represented men, and this is probably the origin of
the homunculus of the middle ages, the notion of the creative power of
metals and that of life being confounded in the same symbol." *
     Thus Albertus Magnus traces the influence of congenital defects
in the generation of metals and of animals, and Basil Valentine
symbolises the loss of metalline character, which we now know is due
to oxidation, to the escape from the metal of an indestructible spirit
which flies away and becomes a soul.                  On the other hand, the
" reduction " of metals from their oxides was supposed to give the
metals a new existence. f A poem of the thirteenth century well
embodies this belief in the analogies between men and metals, in the
quaint lines : —
                       " Horns ont l'estre comme metaulx,
                         Vie et augment des vegetaulx,
                         Instinct et sens comme les brute,
                         Esprit comme ange en attribute."
" Men have being " — constitution — like metals ; you see how closely
metals and life were connected in the minds of the alchemists, and we
inherit their traditions.
     " Who said these old renowns, dead long ago, could make me
                                "

lips of Paracelsus, and we metallurgists are not likely to forget
the living world ; we borrow its definitions, and apply them to our
metals. Thus nobility in metals as in men, means freedom from

other hand, some of the less known metals appear to be mere " things
which do not exist for themselves, but only for the sake of other
metals to which they can be united. This may, however, only seem
to be the case because we as yet know so little about them.              The
question naturally arises, how can the analogies between organic and
inorganic bodies now be traced ?          I agree with my colleague at the
Ecole des Mines of Paris, Prof. Urbain Le Verrier, in thinking that
it is possible * to study the biology, the anatomy, and even the
pathology of metals.
     The anatomy of metals — that is, their structure and framework —
is best examined by the aid of the microscope, but if we wish to study
the biology and pathology of metals, the method of autographic
                     I
pyrometry, which brought before you in a Friday Evening lecture
delivered in 1892, will render admirable service, for, just as in
biological and pathological phenomena vital functions and changes of
tissue are accompanied by a rise or fall in temperature, so molecular
changes in metals are attended with an evolution or absorption of
heat.     With the aid of the recording pyrometer we now " take
                   " of a mass of metal or
the temperature                                     alloy in which molecular
 disturbance is suspected to lurk, as surely as a doctor does that of a
 patient in whom febrile symptoms are manifest.
     It has, moreover, long been known that we can submit a metal or
 an alloy in its normal state to severe stress, record its power of
 endurance, and then, by allowing it to recover from fatigue, enable
 it to regain some, at least, of its original strength.           The human
 analogies of metals are really very close indeed, for, as is the case
 with our own mental efforts, the internal molecular work which is
 done in metals often strengthens and invigorates them.               Certain
 metals have a double existence, and according to circumstances, their
 behaviour may be absolutely harmful or entirely beneficial.              The
 dualism we so often recognise in human life becomes allotropism in
 metals, and they, strangely enough, seem to be restricted to a single
 form of existence if they are absolutely free from contamination, for
 probably an absolutely pure metal cannot pass from a normal to an
 allotropic state. Last, it may be claimed that some metals possess
 attributes which are closely allied to moral qualities, for, in their
 relations with other elements, they often display an amount of
 discrimination and restraint that would do credit to sentient beings.
      Close as this resemblance is,     I  am far from attributing conscious
 ness to metals, as their atomic changes result from the action of
 external agents, while the conduct of conscious beings is not deter
 mined from without, but from within.           I  have, however, ventured to
 offer the introduction of this lecture in its present form, because any

 facts which lead us to reflect on the unity of plan in nature, will aid
 the recognition of the complexity of atomic motion in metals upon
  which it is needful to insist.
      The foregoing remarks have special significance in relation to the
 influence exerted by the rarer metals on the ordinary ones. With the
  exception of the action of carbon upon iron, probably nothing is more
  remarkable than the action of the rare metals on those which are
 more common ; but their peculiar influence often involves, as we
 shall see, the presence of carbon in the alloy.
       Which, then, are the rarer metals, and how may they be isolated ?
  The chemist differs somewhat from the metallurgist as to the appli
 cation of the word " rare."     The chemist thinks of the " rarity " of a
 compound of a metal ; the metallurgist, rather of the difficulty of
 isolating the metal from the state of combination in which it occurs
 in nature.
      The chemist in speaking of the reactions of salts of the rarer
 metals, in view of the wide distribution of limestone and pyrolusite.
 would hardly think of either calcium or manganese as being among
 the rarer metals.    The metallurgist would consider pure calcium or
 pure manganese to be very rare : 1 have only recently seen com
 paratively pure specimens of the latter.
      The metals which, for the purposes of this lecture, may be
 included among the rarer metals are: (1) those of the pla tin um
 group, which occur in nature in the metallic state ; and (2) certain
 metals which in nature are usually found as oxides or in an oxidised
 form of some kind, and these are chromium, manganese, vanadium,
 tungsten, titanium, zirconium, uranium and molybdenum             (which
 occurs, however, as sulphide). Incidental reference will be made to
 nickel and cobalt.
      Of the rare metals of the platinum group      I propose to say but
 little ; we are indebted for     a magnificent display of thein in the
library to my friends Messrs. George and Edward Matthey and to
Mr. Sellon, all members of a great firm of metallurgists. -You should
 specially look at the splendid mass of palladium, extracted from
native gold of the value of 2,500,000Z., at the melted and rolled
iridium, and at the masses of osmium and rhodium. No other nation
in the world could show such specimens as these, and we are justly
proud of them.
      These metals are so interesting and precious in themselves, that   I
hope you will not think    I am taking a sordid view of them by saying
that the contents of the case exhibited in the library are certainly not
worth less than ten thousand pounds.
      As regards the rarer metals which are associated with oxygen, the
problem is to remove the oxygen, and this is usually effected either
by affording the oxygen an opportunity for uniting with another
metal, or by reducing the oxide of the rare metal by carbon, aided by
the tearing effect of an electric current. In this crucible there is an
intimate mixture, in atomic proportions, of oxide of chromium and

      Mr. Yautin has recently shown that granulated aluminium may
 readily be prepared, and that it renders great service when employed

 is present in cast iron, it protects the silicon, manganese and carbon
  from oxidation.*        The presence of silicon in aluminium greatly adds
 to the brilliancy with which aluminium itself oxidises and burns.f
 It is also asserted that aluminium, even in small quantity, exerts a
 powerful protective action against the oxidation of the silver zinc
 alloy, which is the result of the desilverisation of lead by zinc.
      Moreover, heat aluminium in mass to redness in air, where
 oxygen may be had freely, and a film of oxide which is formed will
 protect the mass from further oxidation. On the other hand, if
 finely-divided aluminium finds itself in the presence of an oxide of a
 rare metal, at an elevated temperature, it at once acts with energy
 and promptitude, and releases the rare metal from the bondage of
 oxidation.     I  trust, therefore, you will consider my claim that a
 metal may possess moral attributes has been justified.                  Aluminium,
 moreover, retains the oxygen it has acquired with great fidelity, and
 will only part with it again by electrolytic action, or at very high
 temperatures under the influence of the electric arc in the presence
of carbon.
      [A suitable mixture of red-lead and aluminium was placed in a
small crucible heated in a wind furnace, and in two minutes an
explosion announced the termination of the experiment.                      The cru
cible was shattered to fragments.]
      The aluminium loudly protests, as it were, against being entrusted
with such an easy task, as the heat engendered by its oxidation had
not to be used in melting a difficultly fusible metal like chromium,
the melting point of which is higher than that of platinum.
      It is admitted that a metal will abstract oxygen from another
metal if the reaction is more exothermic than that by which the oxide
to be decomposed was originally formed.                 The heat of formation of
alumina is 391 calories, that of oxide of lead is 51 calories ; so that
it might be expected that metallic aluminium, at an elevated tem
perature, would readily reduce oxide of lead to the metallic state.
     The last experiment, however, proved that the reduction of oxide
of lead by aluminium is effected with explosive violence, the tem
perature engendered by the reduction being sufficiently high to
volatilise the lead. Experiments of my own show that the explosion
takes place with much disruptive power when aluminium reacts on
oxide of lead in vacuo, and that if coarsely ground, fused litharge
be substituted for red-lead, the action is only accompanied by a
rushing sound. The result is, therefore, much influenced by the
rapidity with which the reaction can be transmitted throughout tho
mass.     It is this kind of experiment which makes us turn with such
vivid interest to the teaching of the school of St. Claire Deville, tho
members of which have rendered such splendid services to physico
and metallurgy.          They do not advocate the employment of the

       An explosion       such as is produced when aluminium and oxide of
  lead are heated in presence of each other, which suggested the
  reference to the old French verse, does not often occur, as in most
  cases the reduction of the rarer metals by aluminium is effected
  quietly.
        Zirconium is a metal which may be so reduced.                          I  have in this
   way prepared     small    quantities      of   zirconium     from    its  oxide,  and have
   formed a greenish alloy of extraordinary strength by the addition of
   y^ per cent. of it to gold, and there are many circumstances which
   lead to the belief that the future of zirconium will be brilliant and
   useful.    I  have reduced vanadium and uranium from its oxide by
   means of aluminium as well as manganese, which is easy, and
   titanium, which is more difficult. Tungsten, in fine specimens, is
   also before you, and allusion will be made subsequently to the uses
   of these metals. At present               I  would draw your attention to some
   properties   of  titanium       which     are   of special interest.        It burns with
   brilliant sparks     in  air  ;  and,   as  few   of  us  have    seen  titanium    burn, it
   may be well     to burn    a  little  in   this  flame.     [Experiment performed. |
   Titanium appears to be, from the recent experiments of M. Moissan,
   the most difficultly fusible metal known ; but it has the singular

   property of burning in nitrogen — it presents, in fact, the only known
   instance of vivid combustion in nitrogen.*
        Titanium may be readily reduced from its oxide by the aid of
   aluminium.       Here are considerable masses, sufficiently pure for
  many purposes, which          I  have recently prepared in view of this
  lecture.
        The other method by which the rarer metals may be isolated is
  that which involves the use of the electrical furnace.                In this con
  nection the name of Sir W. Siemens should not be forgotten.                      He
  described the use of the electric arc furnace in which the carbons
  were arranged vertically, the lower carbon being replaced by a
  carbon crucible ; and in 1882 he melted in such a furnace no less
  than ten pounds of platinum during an experiment at which I had
  the good fortune to assist.        It may fairly be claimed that tho large
  furnaces with a vertical carbon in which the bath is maintained fluid
  by means of the electric current, the aluminium and other metals being
  reduced by electrolytic action, are the direct outcome of the work
  of Siemens.
       In the development of the use of the electric arc for the isolation
 of tho rare, difficultly fusible metals Moissan stands in the front
 rank. He points out t that Despretz * used in 1849 the heat pro
 duced by the arc of a powerful pile ; but Moissan was the first to
  employ the arc in such a way as to separate its heating effect from
 the electrolytic action it exerts.         This he does by placing the poles
 in a horizontal position, and by reflecting their heat into a receptacle
 below them. He has shown, in a series of classical researches, that
 employing 800 amperes and 110 volts a temperature of at least
 3500° may be attained, and that many metallic oxides which until
 recently were supposed to be irreducible may be readily made to
 yield the metal they contain. §
       A support or base for the metal to be reduced is needed, and this
 is afforded by magnesia, which appears to be absolutely stable at the
 utmost temperatures of tho arc.           An atmosphere of hydrogen may be
 employed to avoid oxidation of the reduced metal, which, if it is not
 a volatile one, remains at the bottom of the crucible almost always
 associated with carbon — forming, in fact, a carbide of the metal.                  I
 want to show you the way in which the electric furnace is used, but,
      * Lord Rayleigh has since stated that titanium does not combine with argon ;
 and M. Guntz points out that lithium in combining with nitrogen produces
 incandescence.    M. Moissan has also shown that uranium does not absorb argon.

 molten metal was projected on to a screen.                  For this purpose it
                                      Fig.  2.
 was found convenient to make the furnace much deeper than would
 ordinarily be the case.]
     The result is very beautiful, but can only be rendered in dull
 tones by the accompanying illustrations (Figs. 3, 4). It may be
 well, therefore, to state briefly what is seen when the furnace is
 arranged for the melting of metallic chromium.                Directly the current
 is passed,  the   picture  reflected   by   the   mirror    E,   Fig. 2, shows the
 interior of the   furnace  (Fig. 3)   as  a   dark    crater,  the  dull red poles
 revealing the metallic    lustre  and   grey   shadows      of  the metal beneath
 them.    A little later these poles become tipped with dazzling white,
 and in the course of a few minutes the temperature rises to about
 2500° C.      Such a temperature will keep chromium well melted,
 though a thousand degrees more may readily be attained in a furnace
 of this kind. Each pole is soon surrounded with a lambent halo of

   Fig.  4. — In this case the arc was broken the instant before the photograph
        was taken.      The furnace contained a bath of silver just at its
        boiling point. The reflection of the poles in the bath, the globules
        of distilled silver, and the drifting cloud of silver vapour, are well
        shown.

the grcen-bluo hue of the sunset, the central band of the arc changing
rapidly from peach-blossom to lavender and purple. The arc can
then be lengthened, and as the poles are drawn further and further
asunder, the irregular masses of chromium fuse in silver droplets
below an intense blue field of light, pissing into green of lustrous
emerald ; then the last fragments of chromium melt into a shining
lake, which reflects the glowing poles in a glory of green and gold,
shot with orange hues. Still a few minutes later, as the chromium
burns, a shower of brilliant sparks of metal are projected from the
furnace, amid the clouds of russet or brown vapours which wreath the
little crater ; whilst if the current is broken, and the light dies out,
you wish that Turner had painted the limpid tints, and that Ruskin
might describe their loveliness.
     The effect when either tungsten or silver (Fig. 4) replaces chromium
is much the same, but, in the latter case, the glowing lake is more
brilliant in its turbulent boiling, and blue vapours rise to be con
densed in the iridescent beads of distilled silver which stud the crater
walls.
     Such experiments will probably lend a new interest to the use of
the arc in connection with astronomical metallurgy, for, as George
Herbert said long ago —
               "Stars   have their storms even in a high degree,
                                      As well as we ; "
and Lockyer has shown how important it           is,
                                              in relation to such storms,
to be able to study the disturbances in the various strata of the stellar
or solar atmosphere.     Layers of metallic vapour which differ widely
in temperature can be more readily obtained by the use of the electrical
furnace, than when a fragment of metal       melted and volatilised by
                                                is
placing    in
          it  the arc  on the lower  carbon.
    It must not be forgotten that the use of the electric arc between
carbon poles renders        practically impossible to prepare the rare
                            it
metals without associating them with carbon, often forming true
carbides  ; but  it   possible in many cases to separate the carbon by
                      is
subsequent treatment.      Moissan has, however, opened up      vast field
                                                                        a

infusible metals which may be reduced from oxides, and             it

                                                                        is
for us now to consider how we may best enter upon our inheritance.
Those members of the group which we have known long enough to
appreciate are chromium and manganese, and these we have only
known free from carbon for few months.
                                  a            In their carburised state
they have done excellent service in connection with the metallurgy of
steel ; and may we not hope that vanadium, molybdenum, titanium,
and uranium will render still greater services?        My object in this
lecture    mainly to introduce you to these metals, which hitherto few
          is
of us have ever seen except as minute cabinet specimens, and we are
greatly indebted to M. Moissan for sending us beautiful specimens of

1895.]             on the   Rarer Metals and their Alloys.               509
chromium, vanadium, uranium, zirconium, tungsten, molybdenum and
titanium.     [These were exhibited.]
     The question naturally arises : Why is the future of their useful
ness so promising ? Why are they likely to render better service
 than the common metals with which we have long been familiar? It
must be confessed that as yet we know but little what services these
metals will render when they stand alone ; we have yet to obtain
them in a state of purity, and have yet to study their properties, but
when small quantities of any of them are associated or alloyed with
other metals, there is good reason to believe that they will exert a
very powerful influence.       In order to explain this, I must appeal to
the physical method of inquiry to which         I have already referred.
     It is easy to test the strength of a metal or of an alloy ; it is also
easy to determine its electrical resistance.       If the mass stands these
tssts  well, its suitability for certain purposes is assured ; but a subtle
method of investigation has been afforded by the results of a research
entrusted to me by a committee of the Institution of Mechanical
Engineers, over which Dr. Anderson, of Woolwich, presides.               We
can now gather much information as to the way in which a mass of
metal has arranged itself during the cooling from a molten condition,
which is the necessary step in fashioning it into a useful form ; it is
possible to gain insight into the way in which a molten mass of a
metal or an alloy, molecularly settles itself down to its work, so to
speak, and we can form conclusions as to its probable sphere of
usefulness.
     The method      is a graphic one, such as this audience is familiar
with, for Prof. Victor Horsley has shown in a masterly way that
traces on smoked paper may form the record of the heart's action
under the disturbing influence caused by the intrusion of a bullet
into the human body.         I hope to show you by similar records the
effect, which though disturbing is often far from prejudicial, of the
introduction of a small quantity of a foreign element into the
" system " of a metal, and to justify a statement which made earlier,
                                                              I
as to the applicability of physiological methods of investigation to
the study of metals.      In order that the nature of this method may be
clear, it must be remembered that if a thermometer or a pyrometer,
as the case may be, is plunged into a mass of water or of molten
metal, the temperature will fall continuously until the water or the
metal begins to become solid ; the temperature will then remain
constant until the whole mass is solid, when the downward course of
the temperature is resumed.        This little. thermo-junction is plunged
into a mass of gold, an electric current is, in popular language,
generated, and the strength of the current is proportional to the
temperature to which the thermo-junction is raised ; so that the spot
of light from a galvanometer to which the thermo-junction is attached
enables us to measure the temperature, or, by the aid of photography,
to record any thermal changes that may occur in a heated mass of
metal or alloy.

 510               Profensor  W. Chandler Roberts- Auitten       [March 15,
      It is only necessary for onr purpose to use a portion of the long
 scale, which may be traced across the end of the room by the spot of
 light from the galvanometer, but we must make that portion of the
 scale movable.     Let me try to trace before you the curve of the
 freezing of pure gold. It will be necessary to mark the position
 occupied by the movable spot of light at regular intervals of time
 during which the gold is near 104.5 C, that is, while the metal is
 becoming solid.      Every time a metronome beats a second, the white

 screen A (Fig. 5), a sheet of paper, will be raised a definite number
 of inches by the gearing and handle B, and the position successively
 occupied by the spot of light C will be marked by hand.
      You see that the time-temperature curve, x y, so traced is not
¦continuous.     The freezing point of the metal is very clearly marked
 by the vertical portion.    If the gold is very pure the angles are sharp,
 if it is impure they are rounded.       If  the metal had fallen below its
 freezing point without actually becoming solid, that is, if superfusion,

1895.]             on the  Rarer Metah and their Alloys.               511
or snrfusion, had occurred, then there would he, as is often the case, a
dip where the freezing begins, and then the temperature curve rises
suddenly.
     If the metal is alloyed with large quantities of other metals, then
there may be several of these freezing points, as successive groups of
alloys fall out of solution. The rough diagrammatic method is not
sufficiently delicate to enable me to trace the subordinate points, but
thoy are of vital importance to the strength of the metal or alloy, and
photography enables us to detect them readily.
     Take the case of the tin-copper series ; you will see that as a mass
of tin-copper alloy cools, there are at least two distinct freezing points.
At the upper one the main mass of the fluid alloy became solid ; at
the lower, some definite group of tin and copper atoms fall out, the

     Now turn to more complex curves taken on one plate by making
 the sensitised photographic plate seize the critical part of the curve,
 the range of the swing of the mirror from hot to cold being some
 Rixty feet.   The upper curve (Fig. 6) gives the freezing point of
 bismuth, and you see that surfusion, a, is clearly marked, the tem
 perature at which bismuth freezes being 268° C. The lower curve,
 marked " tin," represents the freezing point of that metal, which we
 know is 231° C., and in it surfusion, b, is also clearly marked.      The
 curve marked standard gold contains a subordinate point, c, which
 you will observe is lower than the freezing point of tin, and it is
 caused by the solidification of a small portion of bismuth, which
 alloyed itself with some gold atoms, and remained fluid below the
 freezing point not only of bismuth itself but of tin. Now gold with
 a low freeeing point in it like this is found to be very brittle, and we

512               Professor W. Chandler Roberts- Austen              [March   15,
are in a fair way to answer the question why T\ per cent, of zirconium
doubles the strength of gold, while T^ per cent. of thallium, another
rare metal, halves the strength.         In the case of the zirconium the
subordinate point    is very high up, while in the case of the thallium
it is very low down. So far as my experiments have as yet been
carried, this seems to be a fact which underlies the whole question of
the strength of metals and alloys.         If  the subordinate point is low,
the metal will be weak ; if it is high in relation to the main setting
point, then the metal will be strong, and the conclusion of the whole
matter is this : The rarer metals which demand for their isolation
from their oxides either the use of aluminium or the electric arc,
never, so far as    I  can ascertain, produce low freezing points when
they   are added  in  small quantities to those metals which are used for
constructive purposes.      The  difficultly fusible rarer metals are never
the cause of weakness, but always confer some property which is
precious in industrial use.        How these rarer metals act, why the
small quantities of the added rare metals permeate the molecules, or,
it may be the atoms, and strengthen the metallic mass, we do not know ;
we are only gradually accumulating evidence which is afforded by this
very delicate physiological method of investigation.
     As regards the actual temperatures represented by points on such
curves, it will be remembered that the indications afforded by the
recording pyrometer are only relative, and that gold is one of the
most suitable metals for enabling a high, fixed point to be determined.
There is much trustworthy evidence in favour of the adoption of
 1045° as tho melting point hitherto accepted for gold.            The results of
recent work indicate, however, that this is too low, and it may provo
to be as high as 1061*7, which is the melting point given by Heycock
              * in the latest of their admirable series of investigations
and Neville
to which reference was made in my Friday Evening lecture of 1892.
     It may be well to point to a few instances in which the industrial
use of such of the rarer metals, as have been available in sufficient
quantity, is made evident.      Modern developments in armour plate and
 projectiles will occur to many of us at once. This diagram (Fig. 7)
affords a rapid view of the progress which has been made ; and in col
 lecting the materials for it from various sources,          I  have been aided
by Mr. Jenkins.       The effect of projectiles of approximately the same
weight, when fired with the same velocity against 6-inch plates,
 enables comparative results to be studied, and illustrates the fact that
 the rivalry between artillerists who design guns, and metallurgists
 who attempt to produce both impenetrable armour-plates and irre
sistible projectiles, forms one of tho most interesting pages in our
national history. When metallic armour was first applied to the
sides of war vessels, it was of wrought iron, and proved to be of very
great service by absolutely preventing the passage of ordinary cast-
iron shot into the interior of the vessel, as was demonstrated through
                   * Trans. Chcm. Boo., vol. lxvii. 1895, p. 160.

the American Civil War in 1866.                It was found to be necessary, in
order to pierce the plates, to employ harder and larger projectiles
than those then in use, and the chilled cast-iron shot with which
Colonel Falliser's name is identified proved to be formidable and
effective.       The point of such a projectile was sufficiently hard to
retain its form under impact with the plate, and it was only necessary
to impart a moderate velocity to a shot to enable it to pass through the
wrought-iron armour (A, Fig. 7).
       It soon became evident that in order to resist the attack of such
 projectiles with a plate of any reasonable thickness, it would be
necessary to make the plate harder, so that the point of tho projectile
 should be damaged at the moment of first contact, and the reaction to
the blow distributed over a considerable area of tho plate.                         This
object could be attained by either using a steel plate in a more or
 less hardened condition, or by employing a plate with a very hard
 face of steel, and a less hard but tougher back.               The authorities in
 this country during the decade, 1880-90, had a very high opinion of
 plates that resisted attack without the development of through-
cracks, and this led to the production of the compound plate.                        The
 backs of these plates (B, Fig. 7) are of wrought iron, the fronts are of
 a more or less hard variety of steel, either cast on, or welded on by a
 layer of steel of an intermediate quality cast between the two plates.
 Armour-plates of this kind differ in detail, but the principle of their
 construction is now generally accepted as correct.
       Such plates shown by the plate B, resisted the attack of large
  Palliser shells admirably, as when such shells struck the plate they
 were damaged at their points, and the remainder of the shell was
  unable to perforate the armour against which it was directed.                        An
  increase     in  the  pize   of the projectiles led, however, to decrease in
                                                                         a
  the resisting power of the plates, portions of the hard face of which
  would at times be detached in flakes from the junction of the steel
  and the iron.        An increase in the toughness of the projectiles by a
  substitution of forged chrome-steel for chilled iron (see lower part of
  plate B), secured a victory for the shot, which was then enabled to
  impart its energy to the plate faster than the surface of the plate
  itself could transmit the energy to tho back. The result was that
  the plate was overcome, as it were, piecemeal ; tho steel surface was
  not sufficient to resist the blow itself, and was shattered, leaving the
  projectile an easy victory over the soft back. The lower part of
   plate B (in Fig. 7) represents a similar plate to that used in the
  Nettle trials of 1888.*         It must not be forgotten, in this connection,
  that the armour of a ship is but little likely to be struck twice by
  heavy projectiles in the same place, although it might be by smaller
  ones.
        Plates made entirely of uteel, on the other hand, were found,
  prior to 1888, to have a considerable tendency to break up coin-

 [The behaviour of a chromium-steel
 was dwelt upon, and the shell was exhibited.]
     It now remained to be seen what could be done in the way of
 toughening and hardening the plates so as to resist the chrome-steel
 shot.    About the year 1888, very great improvements wero made in
 the production of steel plates.         Devices for hardening and tempering
 plates were ultimately obtained, so that the latter were hard enough
 throughout their substance to give them the necessary resisting
 power without such serious cracking as had occurred in previous
 ones.     But in 1889, Mr. Riley exhibited, at the meeting of the Iron
 and Steel Institute, a thin plate that owed its remarkable toughness
 to the presence of nickel in the steel. The immediate result of this
 was that plates could be made to contain more carbon, and hence bo
 harder, without at the same time having increased brittleness ; such
 plates, indeed, could be water-hardened and yet not crack.
      The plate E (Fig. 7) represents the behaviour of nickel-steel
 armour. It will be seen that it is penetrated to a much less extent
 than in the former case ; at the same time there is entire absence of
 cracking.
      Now as to the hardening processes.                Evrard had developed the
 nso of tho lead bath in France, while Captain Tressider f had per
 fected the use of the water-jet in England for the purpose of rapidly
cooling the heated plates. The principle adopted in the design of
tho compound plates has been again utilised by Harvey, who places
the soft steel or nickel-steel plate in a furnace of suitable con
struction, and covers it with carbonaceous material such as charcoal,
and strongly heats it for a period, which may be as long as 120
hours. This is the old Sheffield process of cementation, and the
result is to increase the carbon from 0-35 per cent. in the body of
the plate to 0-6 per cent. or even more at the front surface, the
increase in the amount of carbon only extending to a depth of
2 or 3 inches in the thickest armour.
     The carburised face is then "chill-hardened," the result being
that the best chrome-steel shot are shattered at the moment of
impact, unless they are of very large size as compared with the
thickness of the plate.        The interesting result was observed lately          J
of shot doing less harm to the plate and penetrating less, when its

velocity was increased beyond a certain value, a result due to a
superiority in the power of the face of the plate to transmit energy
over that possessed by the projectile, which was itself damaged, when
a certain rate was exceeded.           At a comparatively low velocity the
point of the shot would resist fracture, but the energy of the pro
jectile is not then sufficient to perforate the plate, which would
need the attack of a much larger gun firing a projectile at a lower
velocity.
     The tendency to-day is to dispense with nickel, and to use
ordinary steel, "Harveyed";§ this gives excellent G-inch plates,
but there is some difference of opinion as to whether it is advan
tageous to omit nickel in the case of very thick plates, and the
                                    problem is now being worked out by
                                    the method of trial.        Probably, too, the
                                    Harveyed plates will be much improved
                                    by judicious forging after the process,
                                    as is indicated by some recent work
                                    done in America. The use of chromium
                                    in the plates may lead to interesting
                                    results.

     It will, trust, have been evident that two of the rarer metals,
 chromium, in the projectiles, and nickel in the armour, are playing a
                                                                  I
 very important part in our national defences ; and if ever lecture to
 you again, it may be possible for mo to record similar triumphs for
 molybdenum, titanium, vanadium, and others of these still rarer metals.
     Here is another alloy, for which          I  am indebted to Mr. Hadfield.
 It is iron alloyed with 25 per cent. of nickel, and Hopkinson has
 shown that its density is permanently reduced by 2 per cent. by an
 exposure to a temperature of — 30°, that is, the metal expands at
 this temperature.

    Supposing, therefore, that a ship-of-war was built in our climate
of ordinary steel, and clad with some 3000 tons of such nickel-steel
armour, we are confronted with the extraordinary fact that if such a
ship visited the Arctic regions, it would actually become some 2 feet
longer, and the shearing which would result from the expansion of
the armour by exposure to cold would destroy the ship.       Before         I
leave the question of the nickel-iron alloys, let me direct your
attention to this triple alloy of iron, nickel and cobalt in simple
atomic proportions.     Dr. Oliver Lodge believes that this alloy will
be found to possess very remarkable properties ; in fact, as he told
me, if nature had properly understood Mendeleef, this alloy would
really have been an element. As
regards the electrical properties of
alloys, it is impossible to say what
services the rarer metals may not
render; and    I  would remind you
 that " platinoid," mainly a nickel-
 copper alloy, owes to the presence
 of a little tungsten its peculiar
 property of having a high electrical
 resistance which does not change
 with temperature.
      One other instance of the kind
 of influence the rarer metals may
 be expected to exert is all that time
 will permit me to give you. It
 relates to their influence on alumi
 nium itself. You have heard much
 of the adoption of aluminium in
 such branches of naval construction
as demand lightness and portability.
 During last autumn Messrs. Yarrow
completed a torpedo-boat           which
 was built of aluminium alloyed
 with 6 per cent. of copper.         Her      Fio. — Half-section Midship of

hull is 50 per cent. lighter, and she
is 3i knots faster than a similar
boat of steel would have been, and, notwithstanding her increased
speed, is singularly free from vibration.
     Her plates are    ,in inch thick, and    ^ inch whero greater strength
is needed.    It remains to be seen whether copper the best metal to
                                                         is
alloy with aluminium. Several of the rarer metals have already been
tried, and among them titanium. Two per cent, of this rare metal
seems to confer remarkable properties on aluminium, and         it  should do
so   according  to the  views   I. have expressed,   for the cooling  curve of
the titanium-aluminium       alloy would  certainly  show  a high subordinate
freezing point.

     Hitherto 1 have appealed to industrial work, rather than to
abstract science, for illustrations of the services which the rarer
metals may render.       One reason for this is that at present we have
but little knowledge of some of the rarer metals apart from their
 association with carbon.    The metals yielded by treatment of oxides
 in the electric arc are always carburised.    There are, in fact, some of
the rarer metals which we, as yet, can hardly be said to know except as
 carbides.    As the following experiment is the last of the series,       I
 would express my thanks to my assistant, Mr. St.msfield, for the great
care he has bestowed in order to ensure their success.          Here is the
carbide of calcium which is produced by heating lime and carbon in
the electric arc.     It possesses great chemical activity, for if it is
placed in water the calcium seizes the oxygen of the water, while the
 carbon also combines with the hydrogen, and acetylene is the result,
which burns brilliantly. [Experiment shown.]            If  the carbide of
calcium be placed in chlorine water, evil-smelling chloride of carbon
is formed.
     In studying the relations of the rarer metals to iron, it is
impossible to dissociate them from the influence exerted by the
simultaneous presence of carbon ; but carbon is a protean element —
it may be dissolved in iron, or it may exist in iron in any of the varied
forms in which we know it when it is free.         Matthiessen, the great
authority on alloys, actually writes of the " carbon-iron alloys."     I do
not hesitato, therefore, on the ground that the subject might appear to
be without the limits of the title of this lecture, to point to one other
result which has been achieved by M. Moissan. Here is a fragment
of pig iron highly carburised ; melt it in the electric arc in the presence
of carbon, and cool the molten metal suddenly, preferably by plunging
it into molten lead. Cast iron expands on solidification, and the little
mass will become solid at its surface and will contract ; but when, in
turn, the still fluid mass in the interior cools, it expands against the
solid crust, and consequently solidifies under great prcsbure. Dissolve
such a mass of carburised iron in nitric acid to which chlorate of potash
is added ; treat the residue with caustic potash, submit it to the pro
longed attack of hydrofluoric acid, then to boiling sulphuric acid, and
finally fuse it with potash, to remove any traces of carbide of silicon,
and you have carbon left, but — in the form of diamonds.
     If you will not expect to see too much,      I will show you some
diamonds     I  have prepared by strictly following the directions of
M. Moissan. As he points out, these diamonds, being produced under
stress, are not entirely without action on polarised light, and they
have, sometimes, the singular property of flying to pieces like
Rupert's drops when they are mounted as preparations for the micro-
scopo.     [The images of many small specimens were projected on the
screen from the microscope, and Fig. 10, E, shows a sketch of one of
these.    The largest diamond yet produced by M. Moissan is 0-5
millimetre in diameter.]

 described : C represents a dendritic growth apparently composed of
 hexagonal plates of graphite, while D is a specimen of much interest,
 as it appears to be a hollow sphere of graphitic carbon, partially
 crushed in. Such examples are very numerous, and their surfaces are
 covered with minute round graphitic pits and prominences of great
 brilliancy.    Specimen E (which, as already stated, was one of a series
 shown to the audience) is a broken crystal, probably a tetrahedron, and
 is the best crystallised specimen of diamond          I have as yet succeeded in
 preparing. Minute diamonds, similar to A, may be readily produced,

also often met with.
      The close association of the rarer metals and carbon and their
intimate relations with carbon, when they are hidden with it in iron,
enabled me to refer to the production of the diamond, and afford a
basis for the few observations           I  would offer in conclusion. These
relate to the singular attitude towards metallurgical research main
tained by those who are in a position to promote the advancement of
science in this country.        Statements respecting the change of shining
graphite into brilliant diamond are received with appreciative interest ;
but, ou tho other hand, the vast importance of effecting similar
molecular changes in metals is ignored.
      We may acknowledge that " no nation of modern times has done
so much practical work in the world as ourselves, nono has applied
itself so conspicuously or with such conspicuous success to the
indefatigable pursuit of all those branches of human knowledge which
give to man his mastery over matter." f But it is typical of our

     We are fortunately to spend,    I  believe, eighteen millions this year
on onr Navy, and yet the nation only endows experimental research
in all branches of science with four thousand pounds.               We rightly
and gladly spend a million on the Magnificent, and then stand by while
manufacturers compete for the privilege of providing her with the
armour-pl.ite which is to save her from disablement or destruction.
We as a nation are fully holding our own in metallurgical progress,
but we might be doing so much more.               Why are so few workers
studying    the rarer  metals  and their alloys ? Why is the crucible so
often abandoned for the test tube ? Is not the investigation of the
properties of alloys precious for its own sake, or is our faith in the
fruitfulness of the results of metallurgical investigation so weak that,
in its case, the substance of things hoped for remains unsought for
and unseen in the depths of obscurity in which the metals are left ?
     We must go back to the traditions of Faraday, who was the first
to investigate the influence of the rarer metals upon iron, and to
prepare the nickel-iron series of which so much has since been heard.*
He did not despise research which might possibly tend to useful
results, but joyously records his satisfaction at the fact that a
generous gift from Wollaston of certain of the " scarce and more
                    "
valuable metals       enabled him to transfer his experiments from the
laboratory in Albemarle Street to the works of a manufacturer at
Sheffield.
     Faraday not only began the research       I am pleading for to-night,
but he gave us the germ of the dynamo, by the aid of which, as we
have seen, the rarer metals may be isolated.            If it is a source of
national pride that research should be endowed apart from the national
expenditure, let us, while remembering our responsibilities, rest in
the hope that metallurgy will be well represented in the Laboratory
which private munificence is to place side by side with our historic
Koyal Institution.

                                      Argon.
It  is some three or four years since          Ihad the honour of lecturing
here one Friday evening upon the densities of oxygen and hydrogen
gases, and upon the conclusions that might be drawn from the results.
It is not necessary, therefore, that           Ishould trouble you to-night
with any detail as to the method by which gases can be accu
rately weighed.         Imust take that as known, merely mentioning
that it is substantially the same as is used by all investigators
nowadays, and introduced more than fifty years ago by Regnault.
It was not until after that lecture that               I
                                                      turned my attention to
nitrogen ; and      in   the  first   instance     I employed     a method of
preparing the gas which originated with Mr. Vernon Harcourt, of
Oxford. In this method the oxygen of ordinary atmospheric air is
got rid of with the aid of ammonia.          Air is bubbled through liquid
ammonia, and then passed through a red-hot tube.                 In its passage
the oxygen of the air combines with the hydrogen of the ammonia,
all the oxygen being in that way burnt up and converted into water.
The excess of ammonia is subsequently absorbed with acid, and the
 water by ordinary desiccating agents.            That method is very con
 venient; and,     when     Ihad    obtained   a  few   concordant   results by
 means of   it,
              I     thought that the work was complete, and that the
 weight of nitrogen was satisfactorily determined.                 But then   I
 reflected that   it   always advisable to employ more than one method,
                       is
 and that the method that       Ihad used — Mr. Vernon Harcourt's method
 — was not that which had been used by any of those who had pre
 ceded me in weighing nitrogen.              The usual method consists in
 absorbing    the  oxygen    of  air   by  means    of red-hot copper   ;   and
                                                                              I
 thought    thatI    ought   at  least   to give   that  method  a   trial,  fully
 expecting to obtain forthwith a value in harmony with that already
 afforded by the ammonia method.               The result, however, proved
 otherwise.     The gas obtained by the copper method, as may call it,
                                                               I
 proved to be one-thousandth part heavier than that obtained by the
 ammonia method         ; and, on repetition, that difference was only
  brought out more clearly.       This was about three years ago. Then,
 in order, if   possible, to get further light upon        a discrepancy which

puzzled me very much, and which, at that time, I regarded only with
disgust and impatience, I published a letter in ' Nature inviting
                                                                  '
criticisms from chemists who might be interested in such questions.
I  obtained various useful suggestions, but none going to the root of
the matter. Several persons who wrote to me privately were inclined
to think that the explanation was to be sought in a partial dissocia
tion of the nitrogen derived from ammonia.               For, before going
further,    I ought to explain that, in the nitrogen obtained by the
ammonia method, some — about a seventh part — is derived from the
ammonia, the larger part, however, being derived as usual from the
atmosphere.        If the chemically-derived nitrogen were partly dis
sociated into its component atoms, then the lightness of the gas so
prepared would be explained.
     The next step in the enquiry was, if possible, to exaggerate the
discrepancy.       One's instinct at first is to try to get rid of a dis
crepancy, but     I  believe that experience shows such an endeavour to
be a mistake.         What one ought to do is to magnify a small
discrepancy with a view to finding out the explanation ; and, as it
appeared in the present case that the root of the discrepancy lay in
the fact that part of the nitrogen prepared by the ammonia method
was nitrogen out of ammonia, although the greater part remained of
common origin in both cases, the application of the principle sug
 gested a trial of the weight of nitrogen obtained wholly from
ammonia. This could easily be done by substituting pure oxygen for
atmospheric air in the ammonia method, so that the whole, instead
of only a part, of the nitrogen collected should be derived from the
ammonia itself.        The discrepancy was at once magnified some five
times.     The nitrogen so obtained from ammonia proved to be about
one-half per cent, lighter than nitrogen obtained in the ordinary
way from the atmosphere, and which

spheric nitrogen.
     That result stood out pretty sharply from the first ; but it was
necessary to confirm it by comparison with nitrogen chemically
derived in other ways.        The Table before you gives a summary of
 such results, the numbers being the weights in grams actually con
tained under standard conditions in the globe employed.

      The difference is about   11   milligrams, or about one-half per cent.   ;
and       it was sufficient to prove conclusively that tho two kinds of
nitrogen — the chemically-derived nitrogen and the atmospheric
nitrogen — differed in weight, and therefore, of course, in quality, for
some reason hitherto unknown.
      Ineed not spend time in explaining the various precautions that
were necessary in order to establish surely that conclusion. One had
to be on one's guard against impurities, especially against             the
presence of hydrogen, which might seriously lighten any gas in
which it was contained.         I
                                believe, however, that the precautions
taken were sufficient to exclude all questions of that sort, and the
                   I
result, which published about this time last year, stood sharply out,
that the nitrogen obtained from chemical sources was different from
the nitrogen obtained from the air.
    Well, that difference, admitting it t > be established, was sufficient
to show that some hitherto unknown gas is involved in the matter. It
might be that the new gas was dissociated nitrogen, contained in that
which was too light, tho chemical nitrogen — and at first that was the
explanation to which        I
                          leaned ; but certain experiments went a long
way to discourage such a supposition.       In the first place, chemical
evidence — and in this matter        I
                                   am greatly dependent upou the kind
ness of chemical friends — tends to show that, even if ordinary nitrogen
could be dissociated at all into its component atoms, such atoms
would not be likely to enjoy any very long continued existence.
Even ozone goes slowly back to the more normal state of oxygen ;
and it was thought that dissociated nitrogen would have even a greater
tendency to revert to the normal condition.        The exp-riment sug
gested by that remark was as follows : to keep chemical nitrogen —
the too light nitrogen which might be supposed to contain dissociated
molecules — for a good while, and to examine whether it changed in
density. Of course it would be useless to shut up gas in a globe and
weigh       it,
           and then, after an interval, to weigh          again, for there
                                                         it
would be no opportunity      for  any change   of weight to occur, even
although the gas within the globe had undergone some chemical
alteration. It     necessary to re-establish the standard conditions of
                       is
temperature and pressure which are always understood when we speak
of filling globe with gas, for
              a                     need hardly say that filling
                                     I                               globe
                                                                     a
with gas     but
              is     figure of speech. Everything depends upon the
                        a
temperature and pressure at which you work. However, that obvious
point being borne in mind,       was proved by experiment that the gas
                                it
did not change in weight by standing for eight months — result       a
tending to show that the abnormal lightness was not tho consequence
of dissociation.
    Further experiments were tried upon the action of tho silent
electric discharge — both upon the atmospheric nitrogen and upon the
chomically-derived nitrogen — but neither of them seemed to be
sensibly affected by such treatment   so that, altogether, the balance
                                          ;
of evidence seemed to incline against the hypothesis of abnormal

18U5.J                                  on Argon.                             5'27
lightness in the chemically- Jcrivcd nitrogen heing due to dissociation,
and to suggest strongly, as almost the only possible alternative, that
there must be in atmospheric nitrogen some constituent heavier than
true nitrogen.
     At that point the question arose, what was the evidence that all
the so-called nitrogen of the atmosphere was of one quality ? And                I
                I
remember — think it was about this time last year, or a little earlier
— putting the question to my colleague, Professor Dewar. His
answer was that he doubted whether anything material had been
done upon the matter since the time of Cavendish, and that                  I had
better refer to Cavendish's original paper.              That advico    I quickly
followed, and      I  was rather surprised to find that Cavendish had him-
solf put this question quite as sharply as           I could put it.   Translated
from    the   old-fashioned      phraseology     connected    with the  theory of
phlogiston, his question was whether the inert ingredient of the air
is really all of one kind ; whether all the nitrogen of the air is really
the same as the nitrogen of nitre.            Cavendish not only asked himself
this question, but he endeavoured to answer it by an appeal to
experiment.
     I should     like to show you Cavendish's experiment in something
like its original form.          He inverted a U tube filled with mercury,
the legs standing in two separate mercury cups.                He then passed up,
so  as  to stand     above   the  mercury,     a mixture   of nitrogen, or of air,
and oxygen ; and he caused an electric current from a frictional
electrical machine like the one            I  have before me to pass from the
mercury in the one leg to the mercury in the other, giving sparks
across the intervening column of air. I do not propose to use a
frictional machine to-night, but            I  will substitute for it one giving
electricity of the same quality of the construction introduced by
Mr. Wimshurst, of which we have a fine specimen in the Institution.
It stands just outside the door of the theatre, and will supply an
electric current along insulated wires, leading to the mercury cups ;
and, if we are successful, we shall cause sparks to pass through the
small length of air included above the columns of mercury.                 There
they are ; and after a little time you will notice that the mercury
rises, indicating that the gas is sensibly absorbed under the influence
of the sparks and of a piece of potash floating on the mercury. It
was by that means that Cavendish established his great discovery
of the nature of the inert ingredient in the atmosphere, which we
now call nitrogen ; and, as         I   have said, Cavendish himself proposed
the question,      as  distinctly  as   we can do, is this inert ingredient all
of one kind? and he proceeded to test that question. He found.
after days and weeks of protracted experiment, that, for the most
part, the nitrogen of the atmosphere was absorbed in this manner,
and converted into nitrous acid ; but that there was a small residue
remaining after prolonged treatment with sparks, and a final absorp
tion of the residual oxygen.              That residue amounted to about TJB
part   of   the    nitrogen    taken  ;  and   Cavendish draws the conclusion

528                            Lord Rayleigh                      [April 5,
that, if thero be more than one inert ingredient in the atmosphere,
at any rate the second ingredient is not contained to a greater extent
than T^-j part.
     I  must not wait too long over the experiment.      Mr Gordon tells
me that a certain amount of contraction has already occurred ; and
if we project the U upon the screen, we shall be able to verify the
fact.    It is only a question of time for the greater part of the gas
to bo taken up, as we have proved by preliminary experiments.
               I
     In what have to say from this point onwards,       I must be under
stood as speaking as much on behalf of Professor Ramsay as for
myself.     At the first, the work which we did was to a certain extent
independent.      Afterwards we worked in concert, and all that we
have published in our joint names must be regarded as being equally
the work of both of us.       But, of course, Professor Ramsay must not
be held responsible       for any chemical blunder into which        I  may
stumble to-night.
     By his work and by mine the heavier ingredient in atmospheric
nitrogen which was the origin of the discrepancy in the densities has
been isolated, and we have given it the name of " argon." For this
purpose we may use the original method of Cavendish, with the
advantages of modern appliances.          We can procure more powerful
electric sparks than any which Cavendish could command by the
use of the ordinary Ruhmkorff coil stimulated by a battery of Grove
cells ; and it is possible so to obtain evidence of the existence of
argon.     The oxidation of nitrogen by that method goes on pretty
quickly.     If  you put some ordinary air, or, better still, a mixture of
air and oxygen, in a tube in which electric sparks are made to pass
for a certain time, then in looking through the tube, you observe
the well-known reddish-orange       fumes of the oxides of nitrogen.       I
will not take up time in going through the experiment, but will
merely exhibit a tube already prepared (image on screen).
     One can work more efficiently by employing the alternate currents
from dynamo machines which are now at our command.                 In this
Institution we    have the  advantage  of  a public supply ; and if   I pass
alternate currents originating in Deptlord through this Ruhmkorff
coil, which acts as what is now called a " high potential transformer,"
and allow sparks from the secondary to pass in an inverted test tube
between platinum points, we shall be able to show in a comparatively
short time a pretty rapid absorption of the gases.           The electric
current is led into the working chamber through bent glass tubes
containing mercury, and provided at their inner extremities with
platinum points.       In this arrangement we avoid the risk, which
would otherwise be serious, of a fracture just when we least desired
it.   I  now start the sparks by switching on the Ruhmkorff to the
alternate current supply ; and, if you will take note of the level of
the liquid representing the quantity of mixed gases included,       I  think
you will sec after, perhaps, a quarter of an hour that the liquid has

very appreciably risen, owing to the union of the nitrogen and tho
oxygen gases under the influence of the electrical discharge, and
subsequent absorption of the resulting compound by the alkaline
liquid with which the gas space is enclosed.
     By means of this little apparatus, which h very convenient for
                                                                "         "
operations upon a moderate scale, such as for analyses of nitrogen
for the amount of argon that it may contain, wo are able to get an
absorption of about 80 cubic centimetres per hour, or about 4 inches
along this test tube, when all is going well          In order, however, to
obtain the isolation of argon on any considerable scale by means of
the oxygen method, wo must employ an apparatus still more enlarged.
The isolation of argon requires the removal of nitrogen, and, indeed,
of very large quantities of nitrogen, for, as it appears, the proportion
of argon contained in atmospheric nitrogen is only about 1 per cent.,
so that for every litre of argon that you wish to get you must eat up
 some hundred litres of nitrogen.       That, however, can be done upon
an adequate scale by calling to our aid the powerful electric discharge
now obtainable by means of the alternate current supply and high
potential transformers.
               I                                I
     In what have done upon this subject have had the advantage
of the advice of Mr. Crookes, who some years ago drew special
attention to the electric discharge or flame, and showed that many
of its properties depended upon the fact that it had the power of
 causing, upon a very considerable scale, a combination of the nitrogen
 and the oxygen of the air in which it was made.
     I  had first thought of showing in the lecture room the actual
 apparatus which     I have employed for the concentration of argon ;
but the difficulty is that, as the apparatus has to be used, the working
parts are almost invisible, and    I came to the conclusion that it would
 really be more instructive as well as more convenient to show the
 parts isolated, a very little effort of imagination being then all that
is required in order to reconstruct in the mind the actual arrange
ments employed.
     First, as to the electric arc or flame itself. We have here a
 transformer made by Pike and Harris.                                I
                                              It is not the one that have
used in practice ; but it is convenient for certain purposes, and it can
 be connected by means of a switch with the alternate currents of
 100 volts furnished by the Supply Company.         The platinum terminals
that you see here are modelled exactly upon the plan of those which
 have been employed in practice.        I may say a word or two on the
question of mounting.       The terminals require to be very massive on
account of the heat evolved.       In this case they consist of platinum
wire doubled upon itself six times. The platinums are continued by
iron wires going through glass tubes, and attached at the ends to the
copper leads.     For better security, the tubes themselves are stopped
at the lower ends with corks and charged with water, the advantage
being that, when the whole arrangement is fitted by means of an
indiarubber stopper into a closed vessel, you have a witness that, as

530                                Lord Rayleigh                              [April 5,
long    as the   water remains in position, no leak can have occurred
through    the  insulating tubes conveying the electrodes.
     Now, if we switch on the current and approximate the points
sufficiently, we get the electric flame. There you have it. It is, at
present, showing a certain amount of soda. That in time would
burn off. After the arc has once been struck, the platinums can be
separated ; and then you have two tongues of fire ascending almost
independently of one another, but meeting above. Under the in
fluence of such a flame, the oxygen and the nitrogen of the air
combine at a reasonable rate, and in this way the nitrogen is got
rid of. It is now only a question of boxing up the gas in a closed
space, where the argon concentrated by the combustion of the nitrogen
can be collected.        But there are difficulties to be encountered here.
One cannot well use anything but a glass vessel.                      There is hardly
any metal available that will withstand the action of strong caustic
alkali and of the nitrous fumes resulting from the flame. One is
practically limited to glass. The glass vessel employed is a large
flask with a single neck, about half full of caustic alkali.                 The elec
 trodes are carried through the neck by means of an indiarubber bung
provided also with tubes for leading in the gas.                   The electric flame
is  situated  at  a  distance   of  only    about   half an   inch  above the caustic
alkali.    In  that   way   an   efficient   circulation   is   established  ; the hot
gases as they rise from          the    flame   strike  the   top,  and  then  as they
come round again in the course of the circulation they pass sufficiently
close to the caustic alkali to ensure an adequate removal of the
nitrous fumes.
     There is another point to be mentioned.                It is necessary to keep
the vessel cool ; otherwise the heat would soon rise to such a point
that there would bo excessive generation of steam, and then the
operation would come to a standstill.              In order to meet this difficulty
the upper part      of  the  vessel   is  provided with a water-jacket, in which
a circulation can be established.                No doubt the glass is severely
treated, but it seems to stand it in a fairly amiable manner.
     By means of an arrangement of this kind, taking nearly three
horse-power from the electric supply, it is possible to consume
nitrogen at a reasonable rate. The transformers actually used are the
" Hedgehog " transformers of Mr. Swinburne, intended to transform
from 100 volts to 2400 volts.                                              I
                                          By Mr. Swinburne's advice have used
two such,    the  fine   wires  being    in  series so as to accumulate the elec
trical potential and the      thick    wires  in parallel. The rate at which the
mixed gases are absorbed is about seven litres per hour ; and the
apparatus, wheu once fairly started, works very well as a rule, going
for many hours without attention.                At times the arc has a trick of
going out, and it then requires to be restarted by approximating the
platinums. We have already worked 14 hours on end, and by the
aid of one or two automatic appliances it would, 1 think, be possible
to continue operations day and night.
     The gases, air and oxygen in abjut equal proportions, are mixed

 1895.]                               on  Argon.                              531
 in  a  large gasholder, and are fed in automatically as required. The
 argon gradually accumulates ; and when it is desired to stop opera
 tions the supply of nitrogen is cut off, and only pure oxygen allowed
 admittance.       In this way the remaining nitrogen is consumed, so
  tbat, finally, the working vessel is charged with a mixture of argon
 and oxygen only, from which the oxygen is removed by ordinary well-
 known chemical methods.            I   may mention that at the close of the
 operation,    when  the nitrogen   is  all gone, the arc changes its appearance,
 and becomes      of  a brilliant  blue   colour.
      I   have said enough about this method, and I must now pass on
 to the alternative method which has been very successful in Professor
 Ramsay's hands — that of absorbing nitrogen by means of red-hot
 magnesium.          By the kindness of Professor Ramsay and Mr.
 Matthews, his assistant, we have here the full scale apparatus before
 us almost exactly as they use it.          On the left there is a reservoir of
 nitrogen derived from air by the simple removal of oxygen.                   The
 gas   is  then  dried.   Here   it  is  bubbled    through  sulphuric  acid.   It
 then passes through a long tube made of hard glass and charged
 with magnesium in the form of thin turnings. During the passage of
 the gas over the magnesium at a bright red heat, the nitrogen is
 absorbed in a great degree, and the gas which finally passes through is
 immensely richer in argon than that which first enters the hot tube.
 At the present time you see a tolerably rapid bubbling on the left,
 indicative of the flow of atmospheric nitrogen into the combustion
furnace ; whereas, on the right, the outflow is very much slower.
 Care must be taken to prevent the heat rising to such a point as to
soften the glass.        The concentrated argon is collected in a second
gasholder,      and   afterwards    submitted to further treatment.           The
apparatus employed by Professor Ramsay in the subsequent treat
ment is exhibited in the diagram, and is very effective for its
purpose ; but I am afraid that the details of it would not readily be
followed from any explanation that             I  could give in the time at my
disposal. The principle consists in the circulation of the mixture of
nitrogen and argon over hot magnesium, the gas being made to pass
round and round until the nitrogen is effectively removed from it.
At the end that operation, as in the case of the oxygen method,
proceeds somewhat slowly.            When the greater part of the nitrogen is
gone, the remainder seems         to  be unwilling to follow, and it requires
somewhat protracted treatment in order to be sure that the nitrogen
has wholly disappeared.           When      I say "wholly disappeared," that,
perhaps, would be too much to say in any case.                What we can say
is that the spectrum test is adequate to show the presence, or at any
rate to show the addition, of about one-and-a-half per cent. of
nitrogen to argon as pure as we can get it ; so that it is fair to argue
that any nitrogen at that stage remaining in the argon is only a small
fraction of one-and-a-half per cent.
      I  should have liked at this point to be able to give advice as to
which of the two methods — the oxygen method or the mngnesium
                                                                                   S~

                                                                  I
method — is the easier aiid the more to be recommended ; but confess
that   I am quite at a loss to do so.   One difficulty in the comparison
arises from the fact that they have been in different hands.         As far
as  I  can estimate, the quantities of nitrogen eaten up in a given time
are not very different.        In that respect, perhaps, the magnesium
method has some advantage ; but, on the other hand, it may be said
that the magnesium process requires a much closer supervision, so
that, perhaps, fourteen hours of the oxygen method may not unfairly
compare with eight hours or so of the magnesium method.                   In
practice a great deal would depend upon whether in any particular
laboratory alternate currents are available from a public supply.          If
the alternate currents are at hand,     I  think it may probably be the
case that the oxygen method is the easier ; but, otherwise,              the
magnesium method would, probably, be preferred, especially by
chemists who are familiar with operations conducted in red-hot tubes.
     I   have here another experiment       illustrative of the reaction
between magnesium and nitrogen.            Two rods of that metal are
suitably mounted in an atmosphere of nitrogen, so arranged that
we ccn bring them into contact and cause an electric arc to form
between them.        Under the action of the heat of the electric arc the
nitrogen will combine with the magnesium ; and if we had time to
carry out the experiment we could demonstrate a rapid absorption of
nitrogen by this method. When the experiment was first tried, had     I
hoped that it might be possible, by the aid of electricity, to start the
action so effectively that the magnesium would continue to burn
independently under its own developed heat in the atmosphere of
nitrogen. Possibly, on a larger scale, something of this sort might
succeed, but     I bring it forward here only as an illustration.        We
turn on the electric current, and bring the magnesiums together.
You see a brilliant green light, indicating the vaporisation of the
magnesium.        Under the influence of the heut the magnesium burns,
and there is collected in the glass vessel a certain amount of
brownish-looking powder which consists mainly of the nitride of
magnesium.        Of course, if there is any oxygen present it has the
preference,    and  the ordinary white oxide of magnesium is formed.
      The gas thus isolated is proved to be inert by the very fact of its
isolation.     It refuses to combine under circumstances in which
nitrogen, itself always considered very inert, does combine — both in
the case of the oxygen treatment and in the case of the magnesium
treatment ; and these facts are, perhaps, almost enough to justify the
name which we have suggested for it.        But, in addition to this, it has
been proved to be inert unaer a considerable variety of other conditions
such as might have been expected to tempt it into combination.              I
will not recapitulate all the experiments which have been tried,
almost entirely by Professor Banisay, to induce the gas to combine.
Hitherto, in our hands, it has not done so ; and       I may mention that
recently, since the publication of the abstract of our paper read

1895.]                          on Argon.                            533
before the Royal Society, argon has been submitted to the action of
titanium at a red heat, titanium being a metal having a great affinity
for nitrogen, and that argon has resisted the temptation to which
nitrogen succumbs.     We never have asserted, and we do not now
assert, that argon can under no circumstances be got to combine.
That would, indeed, be a rash assertion for any one to venture upon ;
and only within the last few weeks there has been a most interesting
announcement by M. Berthelot, of Paris, that, under the action of the
silent electric discharge, argon can be absorbed when treated in
contact with the vapour of benzine.    Such a statement, coming from
so great an authority, commands our attention ; and if we accept the
conclusion, as  I  suppose we must do, it will follow that argon has,
under those circumstances, combined.
     Argon is rather freely soluble in water. That is a thing that
troubled us at first in trying to isolate the gas ; because, when one
was dealing with very small quantities, it seemed to be always dis
appearing.    In trying to accumulate it we made no progress. After
a sufficient quantity had been prepared, special experiments were
made on the solubility of argon in water.       It has been found that
argon, prepared both by the magnesium method and by the oxygen
method, has about the same solubility in water as oxygen — some two-
and-a-half times the solubility of nitrogen.    This suggests, what has
been verified by experiment, that the dissolved gases of water should
contain a larger proportion of argon than does atmospheric nitrogen.
I  have here an apparatus of a somewhat rough description, which       I
have employed in experiments of this kind.        The boiler employed
consists of an old oil-can.    The water is supplied to it and drawn
from it by coaxial tubes of metal.     The incoming cold water flows
through the outer annulus between the two tubes. The outgoing hot
water passes through the inner tube, which ends in the interior of the
vessel at a higher level.   By means of this arrangement the heat of
the water which has done its work is passed on to the incoming
water not yet in operation, and in that way a limited amount of heat
is made to bring up to the boil a very much larger quantity of water
than would otherwise be possible, the greater part of the dissolved
gases being liberated at the same time.      These are collected in the
ordinary way.     What you see in this flask is dissolved air collected
out of water in the course of the last three or four hours.    Such pas,
when treated as if it were atmospheric nitrogen, that is to say after
removal of the oxygen and minor impurities, is found to be decidedly
heavier than atmospheric nitrogen to such an extent as to indicate
that the proportion of argon contained is about double.   It is obvious,
therefore, that the dissolved gases of water form a convenient source
of argon, by which some of the labour of separation from air is
obviated.   During the last few weeks      I  have been supplied from
Manchester by Mr. Macdougall, who has interested himself in this
matter, with a quantity of dissolved gases obtained from tho con
densing water of his steam engine.

     As to the spectrum, we have been indebted from the first to
Mr. Crookes, and he has been good enough to-night to bring some tubes
which he will operate, and which will show you at all events the
light of the electric discharge in argon.          I cannot show you the
spectrum of argon, for unfortunately the          amount   of light from a
vacuum tube is not sufficient for the projection of its spectrum.
 Under some circumstances the light is red, and under other circum
stances it is blue.      Of course when these lights are examined with
the spectroscope — and they have been examined by Mr. Crookes with
great care — the differences in the colour of the light translate them
selves into different groups of spectrum lines. We have before us
Mr. Crookes' map, showing the two spectra upon a very large
scale.     The upper is the spectrum of the blue light; the lower
is the spectrum of the red light ; and it will be seen that they
differ very greatly. Some lines are common to both ; but a great
many lines are seen only in the red, and others are seen only in the
blue.      It is astonishing to notice what trifling changes in the condi
tions of the discharge bring about such extensive alterations in the
spectrum.
     One question       of great importance, upon which the spectrum
throws light is, is the argun derived by the oxygen method really
the same as the argon derived by the magnesium method ? By Mr.
Crookes' kindness      I have had an opportunity of examining the spectra
of the    two   gases side by side, and such examination as    I could make
revealed no difference whatever in the two spectra, from which,             I
suppose, we may conclude either that the gases are absolutely the
same, or, if they are not the same, that at any rate the ingredients by
which they differ cannot be present in more than a small proportion
in either of tbem.
     My own observations upon the spectrum have been made princi
 pally at atmospheric pressure.       In the ordinary process of sparking,
 the pressure is atmospheric ; and, if we wish to look at the spectrum,
 we have nothing more to do than to include a jar in the circuit, and
 to put a direct-vision prism to the eye. At my request, Professor
 Schuster examined some tubes containing argon at atmospheric
 pressure prepared by the oxygen method, and          I have here a diagram
 of a characteristic group. He also placed upon the sketch some of
 the lines of zinc, which were very convenient as directing one exactly
 where to look. See figure on page 535.
      Within the last few days, Mr. Crookes has charged a radiometer
  with argon.      When held in the light from the electric lamp, the
  vanes revolve rapidly.      Argon is anomalous in many respects, but
 not, you see, in this.
      Next, as to the density of argon.       Professor Ratnsay has made
  numerous and careful observations upon the density of the gas pre
  pared by the magnesium method, and he finds a density of about
  19 • 9 as compared with hydrogen.       Equally satisfactory observations
  upon the gas derived by the oxygen method have not yet been made,

1895.]                          on Argon.                                              535
but there is no reason to suppose that the density is different, such
numbers as 19*7 having been obtained.
    One of the most interesting matters in connection with argon,
however, is what is known as the ratio of the specific heats.      must          I
not stay to elaborate the questions involved, but it will be known to
many who hear me that the velocity of sound in a gas depends upon
the ratio of two specific heats — the specific heat of the gas moasured
at constant pressure, and the specific heat measured at constant
volume.    If we know the density of a gas, and also the velocity of
sound in it, we are in a position to infer this ratio of specific heats ;
and, by means of this method, Professor Ramsay has determined tho
ratio in the case of argon, arriving at the very remarkable result
that the ratio of specific heats is represented by the number 1 • 65,
approaching very closely to the theoretical limit, 1 • 67. The number

1-67 would indicate that the gas has no energy except energy of
translation of its molecules.     If there is any other energy than that,
it would show itself by this number dropping below 1 • 67. Ordinary
gases, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, &c, do drop below, giving the
number 1*4.     Other gases drop lower still. If the ratio of specific
heats is 1 • 65, practically 1 • 67, we may infer then that the whole
energy of motion is translational ; and from that it would seem to
follow by arguments which, however,         Imust not stop to elaborate,
that the gas must be of the kind called by chemists monatomic.
   I  had intended to say something of the operation of determining
the ratio of specific heats, but time will not allow.   The result      no           is,
doubt, very awkward.      Indeed, have seen some indications that the

facts were too much for us and all we can do now

     Sovcral questions may be asked, upon which                 I
                                                             should like to say
a word    or two, if you will allow me to detain you a little longer.
The first qnestion (I do not know whether             Ineed ask       is, have we
                                                                        it)
got hold of    a  new gas at all?      I   had thought that that might be
passed over, but only this morning          Iread in a technical journal the
suggestion that argon was our old friend nitrous oxide.                   Nitrous
oxide has, roughly, the density of argon        ;but that, as far as      can see,
                                                                          I
is the only point of resemblance between them.
     Well, supposing that there       is  new gas, which
                                           a                    Iwill not stop to
discuss, because   I  think the spectrum alone would be enough to prove
it, the next question that may be asked is,           is   in the atmosphere
                                                           it                          ?
This matter naturally engaged our earnest attention at an early
stage of the enquiry.    I    will only indicate in few words the argu
                                                           a
ments which seem to us to show that the answer must be in the
affirmative.
     In the first place, if argon be not in the atmosphere, the original
discrepancy     of densities which formed the starting point of the
investigation remains unexplained, and the discovery of the new gas
has been made upon        a  false clue.     Passing over that, we have the
evidence from the blank experiments, in which nitrogen originally
derived from chemical sources           treated either with oxygen or with
                                       is
magnesium, exactly      as atmospheric nitrogen            treated.
                                                           is          If we use
atmospheric nitrogen, wo get           acertain proportion of argon, about
1   per cent.   If   we treat chemical nitrogen in the same way we get,
I   will not say absolutely nothing, but         a mere fraction of what we
should get had atmospheric nitrogen been the subject.                   You may
ask, why do we get any fraction at all from chemical nitrogen                    ?It
is  not difficult to explain the small residue, because in the manipula
tion of the gases large quantities of water are used and, as        ;         have
                                                                              I
already explained,      water  dissolves   argon   somewhat     freely.    In   the
processes of manipulation          some   of  the   argon    will  come     out  of
solution, and  it  remains after all the nitrogen has been consumed.
     Another wholly distinct argument            founded upon the method of
                                                is
diffusion introduced by Graham. Graham showed that                       you pass
                                                                         if
gas along porous tubes you alter the composition, if the gas                       a
                                                                                  is
mixture. The lighter constituents go more readily through the
pores than do the heavier ones.           The experiment takes this form.
A number of tobacco pipes — -eight in the actual arrangement — are
joined together in series with indiarubber junctions, and they are
put in   a   space in which     a  vacuum can be made, so that the space
outside the porous pipes        is vacuous or approximately so. Through
the pipes ordinary air     is led.    One end may be regarded as open to
the atmosphere.       The other end is connected with an aspirator ro
arranged that the gas collected        is
                                        only some     2 per cent, of that which
leaks through the porosities.        The case    is like that of an Australian
river drying up almost to nothing in the course of its flow.              Well, if
we treat air in that way, collecting only the small residue which                      is
less willing than tho remainder to penetrate the porous walls, and then

prepare                from it by removal of oxygen and moisture, we
obtain a gas heavier than atmospheric nitrogen, a result which proves
that the ordinary nitrogen of the atmosphere is not a simple body,
but is capable of being divided into parts by so simple an agent as
the tobacco pipe.
   If  it be admitted that the gas is in the atmosphere, the further
question arist s as to its nature.
    At this point       I would wish to say a word of explanation.
Neither in our original announcement at Oxford, nor at any time
since, until the 31st of January, did we utter a word suggesting that
argon was an element ; and it was only after the experiments upon
the specific heats that we thought we had sufficient to go upon in
order to make any such suggestion in public.            I
                                                     will not insist that
that observation is absolutely conclusive.        It is certainly strong
evidence.    But the subject is difficult, and one that has given rise to
some   difference   of opinion among physicists.      At any rate this
 property distinguishes argon very sharply from all the ordinary
gases.
     One question which occurred to us at the earliest stage of the
enquiry, as soon as we knew that the density was not very different
from 21, was the question of whether, possibly, argon could be a
more condensed form of nitrogen, denoted chemically by the symbol
N3.    There seem to be several difficulties in the way of this suppo
sition. Would such a constitution be consistent 'with the ratio of
specific heats (1 ¦65) ?      That seems extremely doubtful.        Another
question is, can the density be really as high as 21, the number
required on the supposition of N3 ? As to this matter, Professor
Ramsay has repeated his measurements of density, and he finds that
ho cannot get even so high as 20. To suppose that the density of
argon is really 21, and that it appears to bo 20 in consequence of
nitrogen still mixed with     it,would be to suppose     contamination with
                                                            a

 some 14 per cent. of nitrogen, whereas           seems that from one-and-
 a-half to two per cent.     iseasily enough detected by the spectroscope.
 Another question     that  may be asked is, would Ns require so much
 cooling to condense    it as argon requires?
     There is  one other matter on which         I would like to say word
                                                                    a
 — the question as to what N3 would be like              we had it. There
                                                        if
 seems to be  a  great discrepancy of opinions.       Some high authorities,
 among whom must be included,            I  see, the celebrated  Mendeleef,
 consider that N3 would be an exceptionally stable body but most;
 of the chemists with whom        I  have consulted are of opinion that N3
 would be explosive,    or,  at  any rate, absolutely unstable.    That is   a
 question which may        bo  left  for the future to decide.     Wo must
 not attempt to put these matters too positively. The balance of
 evidence still seems to be against the supposition that argon        is  Na,
 but for my part  I   do not wish to dogmatise.
      A few weeks ago we had an eloquent lecture from Professor

                    Secretary and Vice-President, in the Chair.
              John Hopkinson, Esq. M.A. D.Sc. F.R.S. M.B.I.
        The Effects     of Electric Currents in Iron    on its Magnetisation.
  Let   us recall a well-known experiment of Faraday's.              Upon a ring of
  iron is wound a few turns of copper wire, through which may be
   passed a current. On it is a so wound a second coil, the ends of
  which are connected to a galvanometer.             It was known that when a
  current is passed through the first-named or primary coil, the ring
  becomes a magnet, and that if the current is reversed in direction the
  magnetisation       is also reversed.       Faraday showed that when the
  magnetism      is  reversed,   a  transient  current is caused in the second
  coil.    The  current    which   is reversed  is a measure of the magnetising
  force ; the total amount of current caused in the second coil by the
  reversal is a measure of the induction of the magnet.                The current
 in the second coil is opposed in direction to the current in the
 primary after reversal — that is, it is in the direction of the current
 before reversal.        If the changes in magnetisation in the iron produce
 a current in the coil which is connected to the galvanometer, it is
 clear that they will also tend to produce a current in the coil which
 in like manner surrounds the magnet, and which has been connected
 to the battery.       This current is what used to be known as the extra
 current.     It continues for a short time the current in the battery coil
 in the direction which it had before reversal, and retards its change
 to the opposite direction.         If the battery which gives the current is a
 battery of many cells, and its extra E.M.F. is taken up by ordinary
 non-inductive resistances, there will be an E.M.F. in the battery to
overcome these currents produced by the change of magnetisation,
and the reversal of the current will be effected speedily. If, however,
the number of cells is only sufficient to produce a current through the
resistances of the electromagnet, the change will be much slower.
      I have here an ordinary Westinghouse transformer which has an
electromagnet in the ring form, but the iron of its core is divided into
thin plates for the purpose of preventing currents in tho iron itself.
There is upon it a primary coil connected to the battery and a
secondary coil connected to the galvanometer.              I  will first show you
the effect produced when a battery current is produced by a battery

540                          Dr. John Hopkinson                [April   2G,
of one cell giving about two volts. You observe that the current
induced in the secondary coil takes a somewhat long time for its
production and for its subsequent diminution — about 15 seconds.          I
will now connect it to a battery of high E.M.F. or rather to the
mains which supply current to the building, and we will repeat the
experiment with the same current in the primary coil.         Observe the
difference.    The current increases more rapidly and dies away very
much more quickly, taking in all about three seconds instead of 15
seconds, as before.     I should perhaps here state that the sensibility of
the galvanometer has been altered between the two experiments, so as
to give a deflection of convenient size to be observed upon the screen.
                                    Fig. 1.
 In  the first case it is very much more sensitive than in the second.
 Exactly the same experiment can be shown to you in another form.
 These galvanometer deflections can be exhibited in the form of curves,
 in which the abscissas represent times and the ordinates represent the
 deflections.    The curve which I am showing you (Fig. 1) has actually
 been taken as a photograph, the plate being moved across the field
 with uniform velocity. On the same plate you see the curves which
 have been obtained with a larger E.M.F. and with a smaller one.
 The times at which the reversal occurred in each case are marked by
 the sudden change at the beginning of the curve.         You see exactly
 the same thing as you saw upon the screen : the big battery makes
 the changes occur rapidly, the small battery allows them to occur

1895.]       on the Effects    of Electric Currents in Iron,  dec.           541
more slowly.     The dip of the curve for the large battery beyond the
axes of the ordinates is not a real part of the phenomena.                 It is
caused by the momentum         of  the  moving part  of the galvanometer.
    In these experiments the iron has been divided in order to get rid
of the particular effect about which           I wish to speak this evening.
Iron, as everybody knows, is a good conductor of electricity, not so
good as copper, but still much better than any other substance than
the metals.     In a magnet, then, with a solid iron core, the outer
portions  of  the   iron are in a similar position to the copper coils
surrounding   the  iron.     On reversing the magnetising current, currents
will be induced   in   the  iron, and these currents will delay the changes

of magnetic induction within them, and they will delay them tho
more the deeper in the iron is the point under consideration.             I have
in the room below a large magnet, which has been expressly con
structed for the purpose of investigating the changes of induction
which occur at different depths in the iron when the magnetising
current is reversed.       It is shown diagrammatical ly in Fig. 2. One
view represents tho vertical section of the magnet, the other the
horizontal section.      The magnet consists of a central cylinder of iron
surrounded by an annulus with a large slab of iron at each end for
 the purpose of completing the magnetic circuit.          Between the central
cylinder  and  the   annulus    are  placed the  magnetising copper coils      In

542                           Dr. John Eopkinson                      [April 26,
the solid cylinder holes are drilled at right angles to each other, and
these holes meet within the iron.          A strand of copper wire has been
drawn in through the holes, and has subsequently been connected up
so that the coils of the strand are in series with each other.           In this
way we have a coil surrounding a portion of the iron at 3, at 2, and
at 1, of approximately the same area.            If  these coils then are con
nected to a galvanometer they will measure the changes of induction
which occur in the areas 3, 2 and 1 enclosed, and we shall be able to
show you the times at which the currents in the iron permit the effect
of reversal in the copper coils to be manifest.          We have, in addition,
a coil, marked 4, in the outer magnet.             Now, when the currents in
                                      Fig.  3.
the large copper coils are reversed, the magnetism or the induction in
the coils 1, 2, 3 and 4 will also be reversed, but more slowly, and
currents will be induced in these coils.           I propose to show you the
way in which these currents occur           and   are  modified by the currents
in the iron.     We shall see that the changes in induction induce
currents in the iron, and that these in their turn delay the changes in
induction.
    In order to give you a better idea of what is happening, we have
provided three galvanometers.         The galvanometers throw their images
upon   the  screen  at  different   altitudes.      Now, what I want you to
observe is this  — that   the  disturbance     of  induction   in the outermost

  1895.]      on the Effects of Electric Currents in Iron, dc.        543
 coil occurs immediately upon reversal of the current, and it occurs
 after some time in No. 2 coil, and after a much longer time in No. 1
 coil, and also to observe the difference of the effects according as the
 magnetising current is large or small. In all these experiments a
 considerable battery power is used, and its excess of E.M.F. is taken
  up with non-inductive resistances consisting of lamps ; that is in order
 to confine the effects to the currents in the iron, and to get rid as far
 as possible of the effects of induction in the copper coils themselves.
 W« -will begin with a somewhat low force, 2 ¦4. You notice that, as
 shown in Fig. 3, the galvanometer of No. 3 coil is promptly deflected,
 and as promptly returns to zero, because there is no depth of iron
 outside it in which currents can circulate. No. 2 coil soon moves off

to a substantial deflection, and presently, after 50 seconds have
elapsed, it moves off to a greater deflection.     The behaviour of No. 1
coil is not dissimilar, but it takes much longer. As in the case of
the transformer, the same thing can be shown as a curve (Fig. 3).
Observe the relation of currents in the exploring coils to time.    No. 3
coil rises to a maximum, and at once ceases.         No. 2 goes off fairly
rapidly, dwells for a time, and then rises to a full maximum at about
50 seconds ; whilst No. 1 coil goes through the same events, but more
slowly, as is shown by the increased abscissae taking four minutes to
reach its maximum.       Here is a curve (Fig. 4) for a lower force, 1 • 2,
half of the last : notice how great the difference — the maximum is
reached much more speedily and the currents drop more slowly.

 of Nos.    2 and 1,     which are about the same.         You see a new phenomenon
 develop : there is a first maximum in Nos. 2 and 1 coils, followed by
 a dwell and then a rise to a second maximum.                 Look at the correspond
 ing   curves   (Fig.      5).   The  maxima     are  occurring   earlier than with the
 force of 2 ¦4:— that for No. 2 coil at 30 seconds instead of 50 seconds,
 and of No. 1, the centre coil, at 130 seconds instead of 240.                   Again
 take a higher force, this time 11 (Fig. 6) : see how marked the first
 rise has become. On the curve notice that the maximum of No. 1 coil
 is as great as No. 2 — with lower forces it has always been less. The
 highest force        I   shall show you is 24 (Fig. 7), and it is really the
  prettiest.     The first maxima occur markedly at once. No. 2 coil
 comes down to a small value, then rises to a substantial maximum in

  about 10 seconds, remains near its maximum value for 10 seconds,
  and passes away.             Whilst No. 2 has been at its maximum, No. 1 has
  been quietly remaining undisturbed, and only when No. 2 has quite
  finished does No. 1 suddenly move off to a maximum greater than
  No. 2 at 35 seconds and then very suddenly disappear.                        We must
  not leave this part of the subject without showing one experiment
  with No. 4 coil, which is placed in the annular part of the magnet.
  We will use the maximum force (24). The general character of the
  changes is the same as before, but in this case the magnetism changes
  at once in the interior of the ring, and later at parts nearer to the
  outside.     You seo the same thing from the curve, Fig. 8.
       I am afraid I can only give you a very general explanation of the
  peculiarities of these curves.           I   will first of all throw upon the screen
  a diagram (Fig. 9) showing what are known as cyclic curves of

magnetisation.    The vertical ordinates represent the induction, and
the horizontal abscissas the magnetising force.          You will observe
that when the magnetising force is small the ratio of induction to
magnetising force is also small ; that as the magnetising force
increases this ratio is also increased for a time, but that, finally, it
again becomes small. You will observe, further, that when the
magnetising force is great the curve of magnetisation begins with a
small rate of change, which then becomes large, and which again
becomes finally small. Now the slowness of changes of induction
depends upon the largeness of the ratio of induction to magnetising
force, and, therefore, we should expect that when this ratio is small
the changes would occur with comparative rapidity, and that when
it is large they would occur more slowly. This is exactly what we

have seen.    With a small force the change shows itself almost at
once ; with   an intermediate     force the principal maximum occurs
much later, and with     a  large force it is continuously being accele
rated as the force    becomes   larger. The first rise that occurs with
a large force is due to the early part of the curve of induction, where
changes of induction are comparatively small, and where consequently
the effects rush in rapidly.       This first maximum is followed by a
time of comparative quiescence, which is again succeeded by a
second and large maximum caused by the full effect of the great
changes of induction which have occurred, but which have passed in
comparatively slowly ; and then, finally, the change drops away to
zero quite suddenly, owing to the great rate at which the last part of
tho change has rushed in and pressed upon the parts which had
occurred before it.

     These phenomena of the times at which changes of induction
occur   in the cores of electromagnets have a close analogy to the
retardation of signals upon cables. Many of you know if a battery
is connected to a submarine telegraph cable, and if its connection
is suddenly reversed, that the current throughout that cable is not
reversed at once, but that it takes an appreciable time before the
effect is perceptible at the far end of the cable.         This retardation of
the signal,  as  it  is called, rapidly    increases  with  the length of the
cable.    I will first of all show you two curves of arrival, as they are
called, of the current in a cable (Fig. 10).             In these curves the
ordinates represent the currents, and the abscissae represent the
times.    You will observe that there are two curves shown            ; one  is

for a length of cable double the        other, the longer cable giving the
slower times.      Now all that the      curves in this form are capable of
showing you is that with the            longer cable the events are more
retarded.     In order to make         them really comparable with the
magnetic experiments, we must show a curve in which the abscissat
represent, not the currents, but the rate of change of current.            We
have such a curve hero (Fig. 11).         In this case the abscissae represent
the rate at which the current is changed, and the ordinates represent
the time.    This curve has a remarkable similarity to the magnetic
curve with the lowest current.           The similarity of the curves, as
shown in Fig. 12, is quite sufficient to suggest an analogy between
tho phenomena which actually exist.              I  can show you the same
thing in another way.           There are in the library one of Lord

 1895.]        on the 'Effect* of Electric Currents in Iron, dc.           549
 Kelvin's   syphon   recorders, made by Messrs. Muirhcad & Co., which
 will  be at work after tho lecture, and also an artificial cable, which
 has also been made by Messrs. Muirhead & Co.                  Curves can bo
 obtained from the end and middle of the cable.
      Magnetic experiments such as these have really a wide appli
 cation.   They are not restricted to the particular size of the cylinder
 upon which the experiment is made.             If the cylinder is larger or
 smaller similar magnetic events will happen, but they will happen
 at times shorter or longer in direct proportion to the square of the
 linear dimensions of the cylinders — that is, to the areas of the
 cylinders.    Hence we may boldly infer what will happen in magnet
 cores of dimensions too small to experiment upon or so large that
 they would be very costly to make.           For example, suppose a core is
                 .           \     .—.                ,
                                     Fig. 12.
made up     of wires T^5 of an inch in diameter, we may expect that
everything will go on with the same currents around the core but
 1,440,000 times as fast ; with a force of 24, everything will be over
at the centre of the core if the current is instantaneously reversed in
nsUv of a second.
     One very practical application of these results is to the cores of
transformers, but in this case we have not the sudden reversal of the
magnetising current, but the current continuously varies from positive
to negative and from negative to positive. It is not difficult to
imitate these conditions on the slow scale which is suitable for our
large magnet, but if        I  were to show you an experiment            at an
appropriate rate on the magnet which we used for reversals,              I fear
you would find the results intolerably tedious.           It would take some
minutes to get through a single reversal.               I will, therefore, use

      confusing.      If wo had done bo, wo should have seen that the
     diminution      of disturbance with increase of speed was less with
     No. 2 coil than with No. 1 coil, and that it had disappeared entirely
     with No. 3 coil, and wo should further see that the current in No. 2
     coil lay behind No. 3, and in No. 1 behind No. 2.              I can show you
     the contrast more effectively         with the Westinghouse transformer
     with a divided core.         This is now connected to the lowest gal
    vanometer.        We turn slowly : notice the deflection.       We turn faster :
    you see the deflection is increased instead of diminished, as it was
    with the central coil of the solid electromagnet.              Experiments such
    as these are at once applicable to transformer            cores and the cores of
    dynamo machines.          They show that in practice manufacturers have
   divided the iron about enough, and not too much.

induction has diminished, and we have, lastly, the curve c, where the
period of the cycle is four-tenths of a second, and you will observe
that it has much more diminished.        This is owing to the fact that
changes of induction in the centre of the iron hardly exist, and that
therefore the total effect is materially diminished. The diagram
(Fig. 15) is for steel. We have a the natural curve of induction ;

when the period is six-tenths of a second.       Curves such as these, of

      Inconclusion, let us indulge in a little wild speculation, not
because  it is probable that it is in any sense true, but because it is
interesting. Suppose a magnet were made exactly like the one on
which we experimented, but of the size of the earth, and that some
mighty electrician generated such a current in its copper coils as
would give a magnetising force of 2 • 5, and then reversed      would   it,   it
take some thousands of millions of years before the rate of dis
turbance at the centre attained its maximum value.     The speculation
I  suggest is  this :     not conceivable that the magnetism of the
                         is   it
eaith may be due to currents in its material sustained by its
changing induction but slowly dying away                ?

                The Structure and Function    of the Horse's Foot.
The structure and function of the horse's foot is a subject which is
not only of theoretical interest but of supreme practical importance.
When    I  tell you that half the unsoundness and at least half the lame
ness amongst horses in this kingdom are due to trouble either in or near
the foot, you will, 1 am sure, agree with me that it is impossible to
over-estimate the importance of the subject which            I have to bring
before you this evening.
    The reason why the foot should bo such a frequent seat of unsound
ness is not difficult to understand, when we remember the unnatural
conditions under which horses both in town and country have to work,
and, further, the risk they incur from shoeing.
     Shoeing is a necessary evil, but the harm resulting from the
application of a shoe to the foot is not in itself great ; it is the abuse
of shoeing which constitutes the danger. The serious and senseless
mutilations which are practised on the foot rob shoeing of much of its
value, and constitute it a standing reproach to our civilisation.
     I regret that the time at my disposal will not admit of the question
of shoeing being touched on ; but during this discourse, as opportunity
occurs,   I will allude to some of the great evils which are practised in
this indispensable art, evils which     I  may at once say might in a few
months be swept away throughout the length and breadth of the land,
if the horse-owning community possessed even an elementary
knowledge of the manner in which the horse's foot is built up, and
the use of its various parts.
     It is probable that the majority of laymen regard the foot as a
solid block of horn placed at the end of the limb, and on which the
horse stands.       I  shall hope to show you that the foot is a highly
specialised structure, endowed with tissues possessing acute sensation,
mechanisms by which concussion is warded off, a blood supply
unequalled in any other part of the body, the whole being enclosed
 within a covering of horn known as the hoof.
     The foot is therefore divided into two parts, a core consisting of
 bones, blood-vessels,       tendons and other tissues, which in shape
 resembles    a  miniature   hoof, and enveloping this a covering of horn

possessing neither blood-vessels nor nerves ; the first is called the
sensitive, the other the insensitive foot, aud the two fit together much as
a finger fits into a glove.*
     Various names have been given to the different parts of the foot :
for instance, the wall is the portion visible when the foot is on the
ground ; the position of the sole is obvious ; whilst a wedge-shaped
piece of horn placed in the central and posterior part of the foot is
                                  "
vulgarly known as the " frog — we shall speak of it as the foot-pad ;
finally, a portion of the wall inflected at the heels forms a part known
as the bars.
     It is impossible to completely grasp the function and structure of
the foot unless we possess some information as to the nature of horn.
     If horn be examined under the microscope it is found to consist of
cells which resemble the scales found on the skin ; in fact, hoof is
modified skin, the cells forming which have, by a process of com
pression and chemical change, become converted from scales of skin
to scales of horn.
     The essential microscopical feature is the presence of canals,
 around     and between which the cells are arranged, uniting and
 knitting the parts together in such a way as to produce the tough
 yielding material known as horn. The tubes run through the entire
length of the structure ; they are not completely hollow, as the name
 might imply, but are lightly packed with very soft cells.
     Horn which is dry, as in any of the feet on this table, is as brittle
 as glass, and fractures like a piece of glue. Horn which is moist cannot
 be broken ; it can be twisted and torn, but only with difficulty.    Under
 pressure   the moist  horn  yields, the dry horn  breaks.
      The moisture in the foot is something very remarkable : in the foot
 pad it amounts to 42 per cent., whilst in the wall, which is the driest,
 it falls to 24 per cent. The use of this moisture is to keep the foot
 pliable and yielding ; where, therefore, the greatest yielding is required
 there the moisture is the largest, and where resistance is most needed
 there the moisture is the least.        Ishall constantly have to refer to
 the moisture in horn, for, as you will see later, it is the essential factor
 in the foot around which all the others work.
      It is through the cells and tubes in the horn that a constant
 passage of water occurs, by which means the foot maintains, in spite
 of the evaporation which is taking place from                the amount of
                                                              it,
 moisture     it
               requires.
      We spoke of the sensitive being buried within the insensitive foot    ;
it   is from this sensitive foot that the horn         secreted, the process
                                                         is
 beinji   aslow and gradual one.    If  we examine   horn-secreting surface,
                                                         a
it  will be found covered with delicate projections known as papille,
 about one-quarter to one-half inch in length these papille fit into
                                                         ;
     * A working model of the font, twelve times its natural size, was kindly
 built for this lecture by Cfiptain Gillespie, Army Service Corps, to whom am
                                                                        I
 very greatly indebted.

holes in the horn, and the tubular formation of horn is due to the fact
that it is pierced at its origin for the reception of papillae.
     The wall of the horse's foot is divided, for convenience of descrip
tion, into the toe, quarters and heels. The thickness is greatest at the
toe, and decreases gradually towards the heels where it is thinnest ;
but the wall at the heels, iustead of being continued so as to complete
the circle of the foot, suddenly turns in and travels in a forward
direction between the sole and foot-pad.        This portion is called the
bar, and the practical lesson which has to be learned is that the
bar is part of the wall, is intended to bear weight, and should
not be cut away in shoeing as is so commonly practised.          In a fuot
of a wild horse shot in Thibet —of which a plaster cast is placed on
this table — the most extraordinary development of the bars is shown.
     It is obvious that by the inflection of the wall the heels of the foot
are considerably strengthened ; and this is especially necessary, as the
circle of the wall is only an imperfect one.
     The amount of moisture in the wall varies, depending upon its
position relative to the horn-secreting surface.       The horn-secreting
surface of the wall lies immediately under the upper edge of the hoof ;
the nearer the horn is taken to this upper edge the more moisture it
contains, the further from the edge the less the moisture.            It is
obvious, therefore, that as the wall grows longer it becomes drier ;
and moderate dryness of horn is only another name for toughness, so
that the portion of wall in contact with the ground is much harder
than the portion above the ground.
     The growth of the wall under normal conditions is the same at any
part of its surface : if it grows an inch at the toe it grows an inch
at the quarters and heels.     You will observe that the wall at the heels
is, roughly, only half the height of the wall at the toe, and, bearing in
mind what has been previously said about horn becoming drier as it
increases in length, you will have no difficulty in understanding that the
horn at the toe is older and tougher than the horn at the heel, which,
from being much younger and shorter contains more moisture, and is
therefore elastic and yielding.     If, for example, wo assume the length
of the wall at the toe to be four inches, and that at the heel to be
two, it is obvious that the wall at the toe is double the age of that
at the heel ; and if we continue this investigation further by drawing
lines around the wall parallel with the upper edge of the hoof, it will
readily be seen that the portion in contact with the ground is of
varying age, being oldest at the toe and gradually decreasing in age to
the heel, in other words, being hardest at the toe and softest at the heel.
     There is an object in all this which we must now enquire iuto.
When a horse's foot comes to the ground in either the trot, canter
or gallop, viz. in any pace which causes concussion, the heel is the
first to make contact with the ground ; by this means, as we shall
hope to show, the shock of impact is considerably reduced, for the
soft tissues of the posterior part of the foot yield slightly under the
strain instead of offering rigid opposition, and this yielding, which

  1895.]      on the Structure and    Function of  the Horse's Foot.       557
  we shall have to deal with more fully later on, is permitted to occur
 through the young moist born which exists at this part.
       From the heel the weight is transmitted along the foot from rear
 to front, and finally the heel becomes raised, the toe alone bearing on
  the ground.     This is the position in which the greatest wear and tear
 of the foot occurs, for the toe is now engaged in giving the propulsion
 to the body, the friction is therefore considerable, and to meet this
 the horn at this part is comparatively dry and very tough.
       We can see, therefore, that the variations in the amount of moisture
 in the wall are intended to meet the wear and tear of the foot.
       The use of the wall is to support the weight of the body : tho
 horse's weight is literally slung inside its foot.       This slinging appa
 ratus is infinitely stronger than if the weight were imposed, as we
 might imagine, on the sole of the foot, and, in addition, it is dis
 tributed over a larger surface than it otherwise would be.
      When wo remember that the mean weight of a horse is 10 cwt.,
and there are many which weigh 15 cwt. or more, there is no
difficulty in observing that the foot is really an extremely small base
 on which to impose this enormous weight.            The area of the human
foot appears     to be greater   than that afforded  by the horse's foot, but I
shall now have to show you that the slinging apparatus previously
spoken of, increases in a remarkable manner the internal surface of
the horse's foot without adding to its circumference.
      Found on the inside of the wall are 500 or 600 plates or leaves
 of horn, which run in the direction of the fibres of the foot — they may
be seen in this model.        In length they nearly correspond to the wall,
 whilst they are so thin as to be perfectly transparent.         Regarded by
themselves their function is not very evident ; but if we examine the
exterior of the sensitive foot, it will be observed that it is covered
with a very large number of delicate sensitive leaves, also of extreme
 thinness, and so full of blood-vessels as to give a bright red colour to
the part.
      These sensitive leaves or lamina) correspond in number and
position to their insensitive counterpart,            and the two sets are
found to be fitted into each other in such a way as to form the most
perfect dovetail.
      This dovetailing of the lamina? produces immense strength : by no
ordinary process is it possible to destroy the union of these two
surfaces, even after death ; special methods have to be adopted in the
study of anatomy if we wish to separate the horny from the sensitive
laminae.
      But the dovetailing is further increased in strength by a remark
able arrangement.         If we make a horizontal section of the two sets of
lamina? in position, and examine them microscopically,* we find that
     * A number of microscopical preparations were placed on the library table
 illustrating the structure of the foot. The majority were kindly prepared for
this lecture by Trofcssor Mcttnm, B.Sc. Dick Veterinary College, Edinburgh.

each lamina, both horny and sensitive, possesses secondary laminae or
lamclltc ; of these there are about 150 to each primary lamina, so
that wo may say the union between the sensitive and insensitive wall
is brought about by the dovetailing of 1000 primary and 150,000
secondary laminie.
    Here is a model of a single lamina 450 times larger than normal.
The structure rather reminds ono of a fern leaf or feather, the stem
being the primary lamina, and the lateral projections the secondary
leaves.
     So much for the slinging apparatus.              If
                                            time permitted  could tell        I
you much more of interest about it ; and the undoubted evidence we
 possess that by   it,

                                                is            horse's             a
body solely supported.
     We have one more point to discuss in connection with the lamimo,
and that is the increase in the surface which they afford to the foot.
The simplest method of explaining my meaning is to take the common-
placo example of     a    book consisting say of 500 pages, which when
bound in the ordinary manner            easily compressed into body having
                                         is                               a
a small surface, yet     if  each of the 500 pages be removed and placed
side by side the area they cover would be considerable.                   Much
the same arrangement exists in the foot.          By the folding up of horny
and sensitive material        avery large surface      disposed within
                                                               is          very        a
small circumference, and careful measurements of the primary and
secondary lamina? have led to the conclusion that the surface thus
contained within each foot of the horse             not less than eight to ten
                                                          is

arises from a stone getting wedged in the foot.
     The sole grows from the sensitive sole, which may be seen in the
diagram to be scarlet in colour and covered with numerous projections,
or papillae, which fit into minute holes on the upper surface of the
horny sole.

is, that as the solo over its general surface          not in contact with the
                                                               is
ground,  it   is  exposed to little or no friction like that of the wall,
which in      a   state of nature          maintained of proper length by
                                            is

 attaining  a  certain   thickness,   but no shedding occurs until     new sole   a
 of suitable thickness has been produced to take its place.

 the foot.   If  we bear in mind the use of the sole      I am sure the ruin
 produced by this barbarous practice will be very evident to you.
 The sole cannot be too thick, and         I have shown you that nature
 provides for its exfoliation. Under the weight of the horse's body
 the sole slightly yields : but this we will discuss presently.
      The foot-pad, or, as it is commonly known, the frog, is peculiar
 both from its shape and the nature of its horn.          The horn forming
 this body is very soft, and resembles rubber ; it can be cut, but offers
 considerable resistance to friction, and when exposed to friction it
 wears away with a ragged surface in much the same way as rubber.
 Its pliability is due to the considerable amount of moisture it contains,
 which you may remember         I stated was as high as 42 per cent., or
 about double that found in the wall.
     This foot-pad has a sensitive counterpart, a body composed of
 fibrous material containing fat, and so like fat in colour that it has
 been termed the fatty Irog. This sensitive foot-pad fills up the
 entire space between the heels of the foot, and forms a dense cushion
exactly resembling in shape the foot-pad, and it is from the surface
 of this cushion that the horny foot-pad grows.
     There is no part of the horse's foot which has been exposed to
more mutilation in shoeing than the foot-pad ; probably there is no
part of the equine less understood, or one where more ignorance
has been shown.
     The impression amongst laymen is that the foot-pad is a dangerous
excrescence, which regularly ut every monthly shoeing must be cut
away to prevent the hoise from becoming lamo.               This practice, I
regret  to  say,  is countenanced   by people   of intelligence, who in the
matter of horse-shoeing place themselves entirely in the hands of their
servants.
     The use of the pad is to save the foot and limb from concussion :
                                  I
its position in that part where previously told you the largest amount
of concussion is inflicted is evidence of this ; further, the rubber
like nature of its horn is suggestive of a mechanism for the prevention
of jar and shock. The shape of the pad, and the fact that in the
unshod or carefully-shod foot it is in contact with the ground over a
largo surface, is evidence that it must assist in providing a firm foot
hold and prevent slipping.       Finally, from its position and use it keeps
the heels apart and maintains the proper width of the foot.
     All these facts can be absolutely demonstrated. Take, for instance,
the last function accorded the pad, viz. maintaining the proper width
of the heels of the foot, a simple experiment will demonstrate this to
perfection.     If  we take a foot with a large well-developed pad, and
so shoe the horse that it does not come in contact with the ground,
the heels of the foot become narrower every day, and in three months'
time the part is beyond recognition, the heels have curled in, the pad
has folded in on itself so that it is not one-half its original width, and
the fibrous cushion previously mentioned as lying above the foot-pad
wastes away us it is thrown out of use.

500                Veterinary-Captain Frederick Smith               [May 3,
     We may now reverse the experiment, and shoe the horse in such a
manner that what is left of the foot-pad is made to rest on the ground :
in a month, or even less, the most marked changes have occurred, the
pad commences to unfold itself like a bud, the cushion becomes larger,
the foot wider, and in three months the transformation may be
complete.    Such is an experiment which may be performed on any
horse with absolutely identical results, and proves to demonstration
that the pad is intended by nature to rest on the ground.
      We must now take a cursory glance at the internal foot, as our
time will not admit of a complete examination.
     The bones found in the foot are three in number : two wholly
belong to the foot, one belongs partly to the foot and partly to the
portion of the limb above the hoof known as the coronet.           Dealing
only with the foot bones, one is found to resemble a miniature hoof in
shape, is very porous in its structure, and has growing from each ex
tremity a plate of cartilage which extends superiorly above the hoof
end posteriorly as far back as the heels.          The bone is porous to
admit of the innumerable blood-vtssels for which the sensitive foot
is remarkable, while the introduction of the plates of cartilage is to
allow of lateral movement in the posterior part of the foot, such as
would not be possible if bone existed in its place.
     The second bone of the foot is one of the smallest, but practically
one of the most interesting in the body.       Its position can be seen in
this model ; and it is unfortunately the seat of the most incurable
lameness to which the horse is liable.     Beneath this small bone is a
tendon which flexes the foot and keeps the bone in position.
     Surrounding all these are the sensitive structures to which previous
reference has been made. But before passing on to the final subject for
our consideration,   I must diaw your attention to the remarkable vas
cularity of the foot ; in few parts of the body do we find so many
blood-vessels.    These diagrams can give you but a faint notion of the
number of vessels in the foot, and even they deal only with the veins ;
to have introduced the ai teries would have complicated the drawing
too much.     Practically the whole of the sensitive foot is scarlet in
colour, from the amount of blood it contains, and the solo use of this
blood is to manufacture the horny covering.
     We alluded just now to two plates of cartilage found in the foot ;
they occupy the position shown in the diagram, and their use is
connected with the important lateral movement or expansion which
the foot undergoes when weight is placed on it.          If it were not for
these elastic plates, expansion of the foot would bo rendered very
difficult. The plates also assist the circulation of the blood in the foot,
by exercising, during their elastic movements, pressure on the veins,
and thus pumping the blood out of the part.
     Perhaps the greatest interest in the foot is centred in the
mechanisms which prevent concussion, these are as follows: lateral
expansion of the foot, descent of tho vascular within the horny foot,
flattening of tho sole, and sinking of the heels.

1895.]      on the Structure and Function    of the  Horse g Foot.        5G1
     The expansion of the foot has been known for many years, but has
always found more opponents than supporters ; it was not until the
introduction of foot apparatus which was capable of making delicate
measurements that it was possible          to convince the incredulous.
Lungwitz    in  Germany   has  made  some    valuable observations on the
expansion of the foot.     Independently and unknown to each other we
were both reinvestigating the phenomenon with improved apparatus,
and obtained results which were practically identical.        I show you on
the screen the apparatus employed by Lungwitz, which consists chiefly
of a shoe to which can be fitted an arm carrying a screw. To this
arm one pole of the battery of an electric bell is attached ; the wall of
the foot is covered with tinfoil carefully secured in its place, and to
it is attached the other pole of the battery ; the contact screw is so
adjusted that if the foot widens when the weight is placed on it,
the tinfoil touches the screw and so closes the circuit, of which the
bell gives the indication. With this and other apparatus Lungwitz
investigated the movements of the foot not only at rest, but during
work.
     I have been unable to investigate the movements of the foot during
work, but on the table may be seen a piece of apparatus constructed
on the same lines as that employed by Lungwitz, and with it        I shall be
able to show you, even on the dead foot, that there is marked lateral
expansion.      There is another piece of apparatus which I have
employed, not only to indicate lateral movement in the foot, but to
register the amount.     The apparatus is constructed on the lines of a
well-known form of steam gauge ; a pin is connected with a series
of wheels which multiply its movement, and convey this for the
purpose of registration to a hand working on a dial ; a very small
amount of movement in the pin gives rise to a considerable excursion
of the hand on the dial ; by dividing the dial into a certain number
of parts and carefully estimating their value by means of a vernier,
an apparatus capable of registering the T^-y of an inch is readily
obtained.    I have this instrument on the table ; it is placed against
the wall of the foot at any desired spot, and, by lifting up the opposite
leg, and so throwing extra weight on its fellow, the foot expands. A
large number of observations carried out on these lines, demonstrated
that during rest simply imposing extra weight on one fore-foot by
lifting up its fellow, caused it to expand ^ of an inch.
     It may be asked what" is the value of this trifling increase ? My
answer is that this " give    makes all the difference between a rigid and
a yielding mass, the slight yielding saves the foot from jar and con
cussion. 1 1 is obvious that the amount of " give" depends upon the force
with which the foot comes to the ground, viz. on the pace, but under
no circumstance is it likely to be more than       J of an inch. The only
part of the foot which expands is that portion of the wall situated
towards the heels.
     On this large model    I have shown you in section the arrangement
of the bones within the foot, and       I pointed out the existence of a

 562                  Veterinary-Captain Frederick Smith                 [May   3.
 small but exceedingly         important bone,      the seat of an incurable
 lameness.      The question arises as to the      use of the navicular bone ?
 My reply to a rather complex question must be brief — it is to increase
 the area of the pedal joint.         It is obvious that an increase in the
 area of the joint could have been obtained by making the pedal bone
 itself larger, instead of introducing a third bone into the joint for
 the purpose.      You will, however, observe from this model that the
 navicular bone has a movement quite independent of that of the
 pedis, it gives slightly when      I  press upon it and then returns to its
 place.   Bearing in mind what        I told you early in this lecture that the
 heel of the foot comes to the ground first in all fast paces, you will be
 able to see that this small and troublesome bone really forms a
 yielding articulation, on to which the first force of impact is imparted,
 and in this way concussion is prevented.            When this bone becomes
 diseased the animal, ns we might imagine, goes on its toes and loses
 all freedom in its gait.
      The next mechanism to be described is the descent of the vascular
 within the horny foot, a process which can be perfectly seen in this
 model.     The whole of the vascular foot under the influence of the
 body weight sinks or becomes depressed within the hoof, to rise
 again to its position when the weight is taken off the limb : to
 revert to our original simile, the finger slides up and down within the
 glove.    The amount of this movement is about yV of an inch. The
effect of it is that the foot offers an elastic and not a rigid resistance to the
 concussion of impact, and in this way neutralises the jar which would
 otherwise be felt, in the same way that it is easier to catch a cricket-
 ball by a retreating movement of the hand than by rigid opposition.
      At the moment of the descent of the internal foot, the horny sole,
 which you will remember is concave towards the ground surface,
becomes slightly flattened, as the result of which no bruising of the
 delicate structures covering the sensitive foot is incurred.
     If  we place a foot rule in such a position that one arm is resting
on the ground, while the other is lying parallel to the wall of the
foot at the toe, and in this position lift up the opposite foot so as to
throw double weight on the one under investigation, it will be found
that at the moment the extra weight comes on the limb the upper or
 coronary edge of the hoof slightly recedes from the foot rule ; when
 the extra weight is taken off the foot, the edge advances into its
 original place.     This phenomenon is associated with a sinking of the
upper edge     of the  hoof at the heels, and an increase in the width of
the foot.
     The change in shape just described follows as the result of a
temporary rearrangement in position of the parts within.
     We have previously drawn attention to the very vascular nature
of the horse's foot ; time will not admit of stopping to enquire into
the causes of this vascular condition, but what chiefly strikes the
physiologist is that a part lying furthest from the heart should be
able to have such a complex circulation carried on with comparative

1895.]      on the Structure and Function   of the Horse's  Foot.        563
ease.    Docs the foot in any way assist in its own circulation ? The
                    I
experiment which am about to show you proves this very conclusively,
and demonstrates that a pumping mechanism exists, by which the
blood is forced out of the foot every time the weight comes on it.
                                 I
     Into the veins of this foot have placed two glass tubes, and both
are filled with water ; by projecting these tubes on the screen you will
be better able to observe that at the moment     I press on the foot joint—
and thereby, as you will remember, depress the internal foot and at the
same time cause the whole part to slightly expand — the fluid rises
considerably in the manometer tubes ; when       I remove the pressure the
fluid falls. Now in the living foot when the weight comes on the limb,
the blood is pumped with considerable force up the veins of the
leg, and at every movement this is repeated. That the living foot
behaves like our dead one, is proved by the fact that if a vein be
divided in the living animal, a jet, as if from a syringe, comes from it
every time the foot comes to the ground.
     The pumping action in the foot is due to the various movements
occurring in this organ, and without their aid it is probable that tho
circulation in the foot would be carried on with extreme difficulty.
     Finally, let us briefly pass in review the changes occurring in the
foot from the time it makes contact with the ground until it leaves it.
     The weight is received on the posterior part of the foot and foot
pad, by which means the plantar cushion resting above the foot-pad is
altered in shape ; the foot-pad and plantar cushion being com
pressed and widened, each exerts pressure on the part of the foot
with which it is in contact, so that both the wall of the hoof and tho
elastic cartilages are pressed outwards, and expansion of the foot occurs.
Concurrently with this the weight has been received on tho
posterior part of the pedal joint with its yielding articulation formed
by the navicular bone. By the time the whole foot is flat on the
ground, the entire sensitive foot has become depressed within the
horny envelope, the heels of the hoof have sunk, and the coronary edge
travelled backwards.       The body now passes over the foot, the limb
revolves as it were around one point, viz. the foot joint, and finally
the heels leave the ground, their width becomes decreased, while
the final propulsion to the body is given by the toe, which is the last
part of the foot to leave the ground.
     The hour allotted to this discourse has expired.         I have had to
take you very hurriedly, and       I  fear very imperfectly, over a con
siderable amount of ground, such, indeed, as might have occupied
our attention for several lectures, but     I  trust  I  have awakened an
interest in a very important subject, and that something may have
fallen from me which will be of use to you and to that animal to
which we are all so much attached.

 Sir James Criohton-Browne, M.D. LL.D. F.R.S. Treasurer                and
                       Vice-President, in the Chair.

                    A Recent Journey in Afghanistan.
Direct British interest in Afghanistan dates only from the com
mencement     of the present century, when in consequence of the
expanding ambitions of the heirs of the Durani sovereignty, esta
blished by Ahmed Shah Abdali in the middle of the last century,
the rulers of India found it requisite to enter into political relations
with the Amirs of Afghanistan.         Since then we have twice fought
serious campaigns in that country, which have been in each caso
clouded with almost irreparable calamity before they terminated in a
triumphant vindication of British arms.           In the intervals between
these two campaigns, and still more since the last, we have entered
into diplomatic and treaty relations with the rulers of that country,
which relations have now happily terminated in a position where
the sovereign of Afghanistan, though subsidised by us, is yet an
independent monarch, than whom there is not in Asia any more
loyal or convinced ally of the British Crown.
     His country is one whose external characteristics do not differ
greatly from those of Persia, from which it is divided by no physical
separation.     A succession of valleys or plains, in which irrigation from
streams or underground wells produces a verdure that is as startling
in spring and summer as are the corresponding sterility and dearth
of colour in the late autumn and winter, are severed from each
other by mountain ranges, the normal features of which are brown
and unattractive, but which in parts of the Suleiman range on the
eastern frontier, and still more, of course, in the main range of the
Hindu Rush, which runs from east to west through the centre of
Afghanistan like a great vertebral cord, rise to lofty altitudes,
scaled with difficulty in summer, and in winter blocked by impass
able snows.      Cultivation throughout the country is dependent on
water, naturally or artificially brought.       The inhabitants are in no
sense   of the   term   a nation.   They have neither common blood,
common traditions, common feelings, nor common history.              Modern
Afghanistan is indeed a purely accidental geographical unit, which
has been carved out of the heart of Central Asia by the swords of
conquerors or the genius of individual statesmen.          The bulk of the
                     ca^e^  Afghan  belong   to  the I'athan stock, which is

 claimed  by some as of Semite, but which         I
                                             believe to be of Aryan
origin.   But there are also in Afghanistan many people of Persian
origin, notably on the Herat side ; a large Turki population in the
Cis-Oxian provinces of Afghan Turkestan ; and very numerous relics
of Mongolian emigration in the shape of the Hazaras, who inhabit
the centre of the country. These people are bound together by no
very strong common feeling, except that of their religion, which is
Mohammedan, mainly of the Sunni persuasion ; by their love of
independence, which is immemorial ; by their turbulence, which is
unique, even in Asia ; and by their enforced respect for a strong
sovereign like the present Amir.
      My own visit to Afghanistan occurred in November and December
last, and was in response to an invitation from the Amir, Abdur
 1 tubman Khan, to visit him at his capital.    Though  I happened to be
the first Englishman who had ever been honoured by such an invita
tion from an Afghan sovereign,          Ipreferred to regard    it,andI
think I     am justified in regarding       it,
                                             as   aproof of the friendly
feelings of the present Amir toward the British people, rather
than as personal compliment towards myself.
            a                                         It was certainly in
such    a  character thatI    was received and entertained while at
Kabul and whilst this may have added to the responsibilities of the
          ;
position that   I temporarily occupied,    did not diminish either the
                                            it
charm of the compliment or the pleasure of the visit.
    I  will briefly describe to you the incidents of my journey up to
Kabul, my stay there, my interviews with the Amir, and my march
down from Kabul to Kandahar, before re-entering India by way of
 Beluchistan.
     At 30 miles from Peshawur the Khyber Pass, after climbing
 to the elevation of 3600 feet at Lundi Kotal, debouches at Lundi
 Khana upon Afghan soil. Here       I  was received by Gholam Haider
 Khan, the Sipah Salar, or commander-in-chief of the Afghan army,
 on behalf of the Amir, and by    a considerable escort of cavalry.   I
 was alone here and during the whole of my journeys in the country,
 having only with me     a   Kashmerian body servant and     a  Persian
jemadar of the Indian Corps of Guides. The Sipah Salar escorted
 me as far as Jellalabad, so famous for the heroic defence of Sale's
 Brigade in 1841-42, where   I  was accommodated in one of the summer
 palaces of the Amir. Proceeding by marches of about 24 miles
a  day, and resting at night in tents provided for me by the Amir,    it
 was on the eighth morning after leaving Peshawur that      I  came in
 sight of Kabul, and entered that city amid       considerable military
                                                  a
display, being escorted to the Ark, or Palace, by large numbers of the
mounted bodyguard of the sovereign.       There   was accommodated in
                                                  I
a   building erected  by the  present Amir   at the edge of the palace
moat, and adjoining the Salam Khana, or great Durbar Hall.
     The city and surroundings of Kabul, with the exception of the
indestructible natural features, which remain unchanged, have been
very much altered since the experiences of the first, and even of the

570                      Eon. O. N. Curzon                     [May 10,
second Afghan War.       The Balar Hissar, or fort in which the British
Residency was situated, and in which Sir Louis Cavagnari perished,
has been completely dismantled ; scarcely a stone stands one upon
another ; only a few bullet-riddled walls remain to revive the melan
choly tale, and the whole is a scene of pitiful desolation.    The walls
on the Sher Darwaza and Asmai heights are rapidly falling to ruin,
and only on the tops of the hills are the forts, which were erected by
Lord Roberts, preserved as arsenals or magazines. The city of Kabul
is one of the least interesting and the most squalid of the Eastern cities
      I
that have seen. Its situation marks it out as the natural capital
of Afghanistan, but it has in it neither external nor interior evidences
of grandeur.     The public buildings are few and mean. There is the
tomb of the Emperor Baber, whose favourite residence was at Kabul,
and who died here, which had fallen into complete ruin before it was
patched up by the present Amir.        There is the brick mausoleum of
 Tiinur Shah, the son and successor of Ahmed Shah, which is in a
scarcely less lamentable state of decay.     The buildings of the native
town are    of mud,  the  streets are narrow and dirty, and the bazaars
have no beauty. Nevertheless a large population, estimated at 150,000,
 is congregated within the walls. Whatever of mark or distinction
 there is in the city it owes to the present Amir. He would like,
 had he the time and opportunity, to rebuild it on a different and a
 healthier site. In the meantime, he has removed his official quarters
 and his residence outside the precincts of the old native town.
      The Ark or Palace is situated on the north of the city, between it
 and the Sherpur cantonment, where Lord Roberts was besieged, and
 is a large quadrilateral structure, with a parapet, big projecting
  bastions at the corners and centres of the sides, surrounded by a
  broad moat. The Amir does not, as a rule, reside here himself, but
  within it are the Treasury and the Armoury, as well as the Harem
  Serai, where the ladies reside.     The Amir moves about from one to
  another of the various country residences that he has built on favour
  able spots in the neighbourhood.     It was in the garden of Baber that
  he nearly died last October, and at the time of my visit he was
  residing in the Bostan Serai, a European-looking villa, which he has
  built immediately outside the Palace enclosure.
      BeforeI    pass to an account of my interviews with the Amir        I
  may give you some idea of the manner of man he        is, at any rate in
  respect of enlightenment and breadth of view, by pursuing the subject
  of the changes which Kabul has experienced under his rule. You
  have all of you probably heard of the workshops and the English
  employes, and the miniature railway and the European establishments
  of the Afghan capital.      These have been the growth exclusively of
  the last ten years, and have been due to the initiative of the Amir,
  assisted by Sir Salter Pyne, the enterprising and capable Englishman
   who has personally supervised the introduction of these improvements,
   and who has done so much to familiarise the Afghans with the
   mechanical implements and inventions of the West.

  1895.]              on a Recent Journey in Afghanistan.               571
      The workshops are a big range of buildings situated on the banks
  of the Kabul river, outside the town, where are employed some 1000
  or 1100 native men and boys, under the superintendence of 100
  Hindoo artificers, who have been trained in the factories and work
  shops of India.    These shops have in the main been designed and are
  mostly   used  by the   Amir for the output of military material in one
  form or another, and upon them he expends yearly the greater part of
  the subsidy which he receives from the Indian Government, instead,
  as many other Oriental potentates would have done, of retaining it in
  bullion or converting it into hoarded treasure. There are turned out
  the most modern and scientific implements of warfare, from Hotchkiss
 and Gatling guns, made on the exact pattern of the original, down to
  Martini rifles and Snider carbines. There are manufactured shot and
  shell, cartridges, cartridge boxes, swords, knives and sabres ; saddlery,
 boots, straps, stirrups, bits, bridles, bugles, scabbards and trunks.
 You may almost turn in a naked Afghan at one end, like the fabled
 pig in the stockyards at Chicago, and expect to see him come out at
 the other end fully accoutred and equipped as a nineteenth century
 fighting machine.
      Nor is this all, for in an adjoining building silver bars are being
 cut up into the Amir's smart new currency of Kabuli rupees at the
 rate of 20,000 a day.       Hard by, soap is being manufactured at the
 rate of 10 tons a week, though     I very much doubt if any Afghan has
 yet applied the native composition to his personal toilette.          And
 candles emerge at the rate of 100,000 in the same period.       Elsewhere
 English stallions, one of them a Derby runner, bought from the
 Prince of Wales, are employed, under the superintendence of an
 English stud groom, in improving the various native breeds of horses.
 English sheep and cattle are similarly engaged with the native flocks
 and herds; while an English tailor makes beautiful uniforms, re
 splendent with gold lace and epaulettes, with which to deck the
 bodies of the ministers and officers and grandees.       From the street
 outside the palace the little miniature railway of Kabul starts, and
 runs for a distance of seven miles to some limestone quarries in the
 hills, whence it brings down the stone which is employed by the Amir
in these and kindred works for the beautification or the strengthening
of his capital.
     I  next turn to my interviews and conversation with the Amir
Abdur Rahman Khan. During the fortnight of my stay at Kabul               I
saw him six times, and rarely for less than three hours at a time.
The Amir is a great conversationalist, and as the whole business of
the court and the government is conducted by him personally, for the
most part by word of mouth, he and his surroundings are equally
accustomed to long sittings, or rather standings (for in his presence no
Afghan, not even his own sons, sit), extending over the greater part of
the day.     The audiences were invariably fixed for 1 p.m. At the first
and last of these       I  wore uniform ; on the intervening occasions,
dressed in London morning costume,           I was driven in one of tho

Amir's landaus, with a cavalry escort, to the gates of the Bostan Serai,
or pavilion, in which he was then residing. At the doors        I was met
by the Master of the Ceremonies — a very handsome and charming
individual, who     I  hope wilj come to London next week — by the
Captain of the Bodyguard, and by the Amir's private secretary and
right-hand-man, bearing the title of Mir Munshi, and by other officials.
                                                       I
Escorted by these personages, always in uniform, walked through
the garden to the building, passing through a room in which was a
piano, with a case painted by Burne-Jones, and came to an inner
apartment where the Amir, who had not then completely recovered
from his recent severe illness, and who was, moreover, a victim to
chronic gout in his lower limbs, was seated at the upper end on a
charpoy or low bedstead overspread with silken quilts.      I was invited
to a chair at the right hand of the Amir.        The only other persons
seated were Sir S. Pyne, Miss Hamilton, the lady doctor who was at
that time looking after the health of the Amir ; and on one occasion
his eldest son, Prince Habibulla Khan.       I have often been asked by
what means our conversations were conducted.        Persian is the society
and court language of Afghanistan, as of all the neighbouring Central
Asian states, and though the Amir can also speak Turki and Pushtu
(which is the dialect of the ordinary Afghan and Pathan), it is in
Persian that he transacts all business and correspondence.        My own
knowledge of Persian is not adequate either to initiate or to understand
a sustained conversation, and our interchange of views was effected
through the capable agency of the Mir Munshi before mentioned, who
has a thorough acquaintance with both Persian and English.          I may
here say that in prolonged interviews with an Oriental potentate, where
time is of no great importance, and in which words have to be weighed
rather carefully,   I regard it as of great service not to be too closely
acquainted with the language of the country. Such knowledge of an
Oriental tongue as a European, even by considerable study, is likely to
acquire, is not adequate to enable him to conduct a political or abstruse
discussion with any ease, while he is apt to be betrayed by un-
familiarity into blunders of which he is himself unconscious.       Given
a competent and faithful interpreter,     I would sooner converse with
any Asiatic potentate in this circuitous way.       During the time that
he is speaking one has ample opportunity for reflection and considera
tion of the proper reply ; while it is in the power of the interpreter,
if skilful, to present the questions or answers of a European in a light
which commends itself to the Oriental intellect.           The Amir is
extraordinarily precise and exacting in his own demands upon the
accuracy of the translator, pausing after nearly every word or group
of words, to see that it is exactly rendered, and fixing his deep and
searching eyes upon the person who is answering or arguing with
him.
     I regard the Amir Abdur Rahman Khan as a firm and convinced
and loyal ally of the British Government.      Though he has often had
differences with the Indian Government, and though there have been

 1895.]            on a Becent   Journey in Afghanistan.                   573
moments when the relations between them were strained,              I  do not
think that on the broad issues of Imperial policy his fidelity has ever
been or can be impugned.      He is the friend of Great Britain, and he is
the foe of Great Britain's foes. He knows that we neither covet nor
desire to annex his country. To us he looks in the last resort for
the protection of Afghan territory, and for the safeguarding of
Afghan freedom.        As an independent sovereign, he is compelled,
for sake of appearances with his own subjects, to exhibit an indepen
dence that to sensitive officialdom is sometimes galling.           Bat at a
crisis it is to British advice  and  arms  that  he will  invariably turn.   I
may mention, as an instance of this, his intense anxiety to visit
England in the present summer.        Though when      I started from India
no one deemed it likely that he would accept the invitation of the
British Government to visit this country in the present year, or even
if he accepted it that he had any real desire to come, not only before
I  left Kabul had he unreservedly accepted that invitation, but          I  do
not hesitate to say that he had no keener or more absorbing wish
than to carry out this resolve.     He told me himself that if he had to
be carried he would yet endeavour to come.           That he has not been
able to  do so, and  has been  compelled   to  depute a younger son in his
place, is due neither to any intrinsic   reluctance,   nor to any change of
plan, but simply to the condition of his own health.             If well and
strong the Amir could, in my judgment, have left Afghanistan with
perfect impunity, and have returned without risk.          But in the some
what precarious state of his health, he has not thought it right either
himself to leave his country under physical circumstances which
might have developed into a crisis, or to allow his eldest son to go
abroad on a long journey at a time when untoward events might have
rendered his presence essential at home.          I  grieve very much for
                         I
this decision, because believe     that the   Amir,  by his personality and
appearance and character, would have made a profound impression
on the British Government and people, and because          I believe that the
reciprocal influence upon himself would have been not less salutary.
       I
And regret also that his eldest son, Prince Habibulla Khan is not
coming, because he is a young man of considerable ability, as well as
amiability of character, and is a devoted adherent of the British
alliance, and because, if an actual Afghan sovereign could not, it
would have been well if a potential Afghan sovereign could have
visited English shores. In their joint absence, the Amir will be
worthily represented by his second son, Prince Nasrullah Khan, who
is a young man of excellent manners and education, and who will,             I
am sure, be received by the British people with distinction and honour
as the representative of his illustrious father.         Be it remembered
that no Afghan prince has ever yet visited Europe, and that the
voluntary presence of such a one as the invited guest of the British
sovereign is a conclusive answer to those ill-instructed and timorous
persons who are always decrying an interference which they would
not themselves have the courage to undertake, much less to carry to a

successful   issue, but whose unanswerable       justification  is its final
success.
     I shall here  say nothing of the history of the Amir or of the pre
carious fortunes of his dynasty.     He has occupied the throne since
placed there by the British in 1880, after the last Afghan war, and
during these fifteen years he has ruled the most turbulent people in
Asia with a hand that is only imperfectly described as one of iron.
I  do not imagine that in the world there is a potentate more feared
by such of his people as have reason to fear him than is Abdur
Rahman Khan.         On the other hand, he is generous and just towards
those in whom he confides, and over his personal entourage it was
obvious that he exercised an influence, one might almost say a fascina
tion, that was supreme.
     In Mohammedan countries, as my hearers will be aware, monogamy
is exceptional among private individuals, and is still more rarely
practised in courts. Abdur Rahman Khan has had several wives, and
his two eldest sons are the offspring of a mother who was not of royal
blood.    Nevertheless, their seniority and priority of claim have never
been seriously contested ; experience and age, and paternal descent,
being, as the Amir explained to me, more valid credentials than the
genealogical pedigree or the personal attractions of a mother.            By
his eldest son, Habibulla Khan, the Amir will, humanly speaking, be
succeeded.     The prince is a young man of twenty-two years of age,
of great charm of manner, very generally popular in the country, and
of good abilities. He speaks English a little, and has for years been
trained by his father in the functions and practice of government.
Should the Amir completely recover his health, Habibulla Khan will
still endeavour to come to England in a future year. Perhaps, any
how, he may one day come as a reigning sovereign.           The second son
of the Amir, Prince Nasrullah Khan, who will land on these shores
next week, is a young man of about twenty years of age, of refined
and studious appearance.      The Amir told me that he was the scholar
of the family, and is devoted to books. In the subdivision of adminis
trative functions among his sons the Amir has entrusted Nasrullah
Khan with the study and superintendence of finance, in which he will
one day be the minister and adviser of his elder brother.        I  need not
here speak of the younger sons, of whom there are two or three, still
boys.    During my stay at Kabul      I  dined on several occasions with
Princes Habibulla and Nasrullah Khan, and          I  look back with great
pleasure upon the long evenings, relieved by interesting conversation
upon their family history and personal experiences, which         I  spent in
their company.        As strict Mohammedans, the Princes ate from
 separate dishes, but they were indifferent to the qualms occasioned by
 the convivial presence of an unbeliever.
     It was after a fortnight spent in intercourse with this capable and
 remarkable sovereign and his amiable sons, in riding about the capital
and its neighbourhood, and in viewing whatever of interest was there
 to be seen, that by the Amir's invitation     I  started on my southward

  1895.]            on a Recent  Journey in Afghanistan.               575
  ride of nearly 400 miles through Afghanistan, and rejoined British
 territory at Chaman in Beluchistan.
      It is now nearly fifteen years since, for the space of three weeks,
 in the month of August 1880, the eyes of all England, and one might
 well-nigh say of Europe, were riveted in anxious suspense upon that
 portion of the distance — 320 miles in length — that intervenes between
  Kabul and Kandahar. A brave English general, with 10,000 fighting
 men, had vanished from all sight or ken within that gap ; and not
 until he reappeared at the other end, and the wires were set going
 under the ocean and over the land with the news of a signal victory,
 gained on the very morrow of the completed march, could the world
 be certain of the wisdom or the foolhardiness of the venture. English
 readers then learned to be tolerably familiar with the features of the
 route from Kabul to Kandahar ; and Sir F. Roberts' march, because
 unattended with incident or, until its close, with fighting, did not lose
 the credit attaching to admirable organisation and leadership, or the
 romance of its dramatic plunge into the unknown.
      Lord Roberts was, however, not the first British general, nor did
he command the first British army that marched that way. Only a
few months earlier Sir Donald Stewart, the gallant commander-in-
chief, had marched up in the reverse direction from Kandahar to
Kabul, to relieve Roberts and to open the road. His advance had
been not unattended with fighting, and it was the success with which
it was crowned that prepared the way and smoothed the path for the
returning and punitive column of the younger general.        The modern
honours of the Kabul-Kandahar road were thus shared by the two
commanders.
     The physical difficulties of the route are small ; and the figures
of elevation will show how relatively modest, for a country of moun
tains like Afghanistan, are the altitudes that require to be crossed.
Kabul itself is 5780 feet above the sea. Thence the road ascends by
easy slopes towards Ghuzni, which is 7280 feet, crossing on the way
the single pass of any height or seriousness that is to be found in the
entire distance.   This is the Sher Dahan or Lion's Mouth, the hotal
or crest of which is 8500 feet above the sea. From Ghuzni the track
descends by a still less perceptible slope, following the broad valley
of the Tarnak river, until at Kelat-i-Ghilzai it again touches the
same elevation as Kabul.       From there the descent is a little more
rapid, conducting to the fertile and well-watered plain from the midst
of which, embosomed in trees, rises, at a height of only 3400 feet, the
walled quadrilateral of Kandahar. But few rivers require to be
crossed in the interval, though occasional small nullahs must be
bridged for the passage of wheeled artillery.         The track, though
sometimes encumbered with dust and sand, runs for the most part
over a hard and gravelly soil, and is equally accommodated to the
movements of infantry and horse. In the autumn and winter an agree
able and inspiriting climate prevails; and although snow may be
expected as far south as Kelat-i-Ghilzai in December and January,

and sometimes lies thickly at Ghuzni, the road is rarely, if ever,
blocked.    When   I rode along it in December last, no snow had yet
fallen, except upon the higher hills ; and the glory of these sparkled
like a white battlement built skywards on either flank of my line of
march.     The journey of 320 miles is divided into thirty-one caravan
marches.    Lord Roberts' army covered it between August 8 and 31,
1880, i.e. in 24 days, including halts.       I occupied 11 days on the
march, being well-mounted on relays of horses sent on for use by the
Amir. But this, which is child's-play for a cavalier decently pro
vided, was a more severe task for my mounted escort of 50 men, who
rode the same animals, without change, from Kabul to Kandahar ;
and on to Chaman — a further distance of 65 miles — whence thoy
turned back again, and,    I doubt not, returned to the capital in much
the same time.    In the East, no one thinks these long and continuous
marches astonishing.     But at homo either our horseflesh is less robust
or wo treat it more tenderly.

     The only places upon this march of which need here speak are
Ghuzni, Kelat-i-Ghilzai and Kandahar, all of which are familiar
names in English ears, and are associated with many memories of
heroism or of suffering.      Ghuzni has been three times captured or
occupied by British arms ; and 53 years ago a British force endured
within the walls of its citadel the horrors of a prolonged midwinter
siege.    The town occupies a remarkable position, with a lofty
acropolis at its north end, and may be compared in more than one
particular with the external appearance of Athens.       I was lodged in
the Bala Ilissar, or citadel, from the summit of which is a wonder
ful outlook over the flat roofs of the Afghan mud houses, on which
grain is outspread, or fuel is stacked to dry, over the crumbling
walls of the city to the irrigated plots outside, where the Ghuzni river
meanders in slow coils, and to the more distant belt of gravelly desert.
The defences, both of the city and of the citadel, which have been
more than once destroyed by the British, are in a state of irretrievable
decay, and would not stand a bombardment of ten minutes.           Those
who were visiting the East for the first time might perhaps be
shocked at the slatternly ruin of places so famous in history as Kabul,
Ghuzni and Kandahar, and might read in their tottering parapets
and crumbling walls the evidence of a national decline.       This would
not be a wholly fair inference.        Life in the East is a perpetual
oscillation between the splendid and the squalid.          Things, places
and buildings are sometimes repaired.           They are never kept in
repair. Repair in Asia is the offspring of a temporary emergency or
of a passing whim. It is never either a sustained effort or a perma
nent condition.
     About 2.V miles from the Kabul gato of Ghuzni is the tomb of
the famous Mahmud of Ghuzni, one of those appalling human visita
tions who in a single lifetime wrought more suffering to the world
than was ever compensated for by a century of peace and prosperity,
but who have fortunately been eliminated from the drama of human

possibilities by the more organised structure of modern states and by
the application of mechanical science to the pursuit of war.         It was
from this tomb that were carried off by General Nott, in 1842, the
famous sandal-wood gates of Somnath, about which Lord Ellen-
borough issued his absurd and pompous proclamation to the princes
and people of India, which were not the gates of Somnath at all,
and which now repose in the meritorious obscurity of the magazine
 at Agra.
     Kelat-i-Ghilzai is also a fortified enclosure, erected on the summit
of a long and narrow elevation which rises abruptly from the valley
of the Tarnak.         Like Ghuzni, its walls have witnessed both the
heroism of     British   assault and the sufferings of an arduous siege.
Like the defences of Ghuzni, also, they are now in a state of almost
complete decay.
     In the centre of the fort is a lofty artificial mound or miri, on the
top of which used to be planted a big gun ; but the muzzle was blown
off by a young British officer in 1879, and the gun was rolled down
the slopes, from which it has since entirely disappeared.
     Similar conditions, as regards external repair, or rather the lack
of it, prevail in the case of Kandahar. More than any site in
Afghanistan is this place associated with British recollections, for it
has been in British occupation on two occasions for a longer period
than any other Afghan city, and its proximity to the British frontier
has at times led some persons to favour the idea of a more complete
absorption. To most English readers the name will perhaps suggest
the successful battle fought outside its walls by Lord lioberts on
September 1, 1880, at the termination of his brilliant march, and it
was with no small emotion that       I rode over every yard of that historic
battlefield. But to me, Kandahar is at least equally interesting as
having been the scene of the labours from 1839 to 1842, of that
which to my mind was the most gifted and far-seeing English intel
lect that has in the present century been applied either to the learned
study, or to the practical direction of Central Asian affairs, viz., the
late Sir Henry Rawlinson.        Those of us who tread at a distance in his
footsteps, will always regard him as our master, and will lose no
opportunity of paying honour to his respected name.
     I had a great reception in Kandahar, riding into the city at the
head of a large cavalry escort, and being saluted on the Topkhaneh or
parade ground, outside the Ark or citadel, by the entire garrison.         I
was accommodated in the Dowlet Serai, one of the few buildings in
the enclosure of the Ark which is in any state of repair ; the re
mainder of the houses and walled enclosures, which 50 years ago
used to accommodate the Barukzai Sirdars, having almost completely
fallen to pieces. Kandahar is a very busy place, owing to its close
proximity to the Indian frontier, and to the great volume of trade
that passes through, and the bazaars were always crowded in the
morning.     I  spent several days there, visiting every scene or site of
interest in the neighbourhood.       But as a warning to possible visitors

578                         Hon. G. N. Curzon                     [May 10,
to Asiatic cities or countries,    I  would add that unless one knows
pretty well beforehand what to ask for and to inspect, one is liable
to see nothing at all.    No one at Kandahar appeared to know any
thing about his native city, and      I  honestly believe that during my
stay  I  imparted much more reliable topographical information to the
Kandaharis than    I received from them.
     From Kandahar      I rode in two days to the British frontier at
                                                           I
Chaman, in Beluchistan, a distance of 65 miles, where said good-bye
to my Afghan escort and my friendly hosts, and when           I  again saw
British uniforms, heard British voices, and enjoyed the dubious con
solations of a railway train.
     If I   be asked what is the prevailing attitude of the Afghan
people towards the British,      I   should be far from drawing, from
the friendly and even cordial nature of my own reception, the ille
gitimate inference that the Afghans are devotedly attached to the
English, or that they have wholly abandoned the suspicions or
dislike of an earlier time.         The Afghans are not merely, for
the most part, Sunni Mohammedans             of a somewhat pronounced
and prejudiced type,      liable  to   waves  of fanaticism and imbued
with a natural abhorrence     of unbelievers, but they are also a singu
larly turbulent people, who accept any control, even that of their own
ruler, with impatience, who are split up amongst themselves by
racial and tribal differences which only a man of blood and iron can
temporarily reconcile; addicted, moreover, to violence and blood-
shedding, and affording, therefore, about as unfavourable a field for
European arts and influences as can anywhere be found.             Add to
this that their chief historical knowledge of England is derived from
two campaigns in which we have invaded their country, have killed
many thousands of their people, and have partially destroyed their
principal cities, and it will be readily understood that it is as yet early
in the day to expect any very extravagant or boisterous evidence of
affection.    On the other hand,    I  have not a doubt that Englishmen
and English officers are personally liked and respected by the Afghans
— because we have courage, which all Orientals respect ; because they
have learnt from experience to rely on English justice and good faith ;
and because they find that Englishmen are apt to speak the truth,
which they themselves are not. Above all, they realise fully, from
the sequel of more than one campaign, and, from the entire events of
the past fifteen years, that we entertain no hostile designs upon their
country, of which we do not want to possess ourselves of one single
yard ; but, on the contrary, that it is to England that they must look
for protection and defence against exterior encroachments, to which
they would otherwise be exposed.          The Amir was constantly saying
to me that England and Afghanistan are members of one house, and
that conviction, though it may only have originated in the brain of a
ruler who is, in many respects, generations ahead of his own people
and age, will in time percolate through the various strata of Afghan
society.    That it will be very much encouraged by the visit of an

Afghan prince to England, and by the complimentary reception which
I  am sure will await him here,       I  have no doubt.    Thus, by slow
degrees, the  suspicion  and  antagonism   that have hitherto kept the two
people  apart  will  melt ; the  barriers that  have  severed Afghanistan
from the world will be thrown down, and that state will pass from
the category of barbarian to that of civilised communities, under the
aegis of the power against whom it once fought with such bitter
intensity, but whom it will have learned, from a later and happier
experience, to regard as its protector and friend.

                          Robert Louis Stevenson.
When a popular writer dies, the question it has become the fashion
                                                                            "
with a nervous generation to ask, is the question, " Will he live ?
There is no idler question, none more hopelessly impossible and
unprofitable to answer.      It is one of the many vanities of criticism
to promise immortality to the authors that it praises, to patronise a
writer with the assurance that our great-grandchildren, whose time
and tastes are thus frivolously mortgaged, will read his works with
delight. But " there is no antidote against the opium of time, which
temporally considereth all things : our fathers find their graves in
our short memories, and sadly tell us how we may be buried in our
survivors." Let us make sure that our sons will care for Homer
before we pledge a more distant generation to a newer cult.
     Nevertheless, without handling the prickly question of literary
immortality, it is easy to recognise that the literary reputation of
Robert Louis Stevenson is made of good stuff. His fame has spread,
as lasting fame is wont to do, from the few to the many.             Fifteen
years ago   his essays  and  fanciful  books  of travel were treasured   by a
small and discerning company         of admirers ; long before he chanced
                                      '                  '
                                                           and ' Dr. Jekyll
to fell the British public with Treasure Island
                  '
and Mr. Hyde he had shown himself a delicate marksman.                   And
although large editions are nothing, standard editions, richly furnished
and complete, are worthy of remark.           Stevenson is one of the very
few authors in our literary history who have been honoured during
their lifetime by the appearance of such an edition ; tho best of his
public, it would seem, do not only wish to read his works, but to
possess them, and all of them, at the cost of many pounds, in library
form.     It would be easy to mention more voluminous and more
popular authors than Stevenson whose publishers could not find five
subscribers for an adventure like this.        He has made a brave begin
ning in that race against Time which all must lose.
     It is not in the least necessary, after all, to fortify ourselves with
the presumed consent of our poor descendants, who may have a world
of other business to attend to, in order to establish Stevenson in
the position of a great writer.       Let us leave that foolish trick to the
politicians,  who   never  claim   that  they are right — merely that they
 will win at the next elections. Literary criticism has standards other

 than   the suffrage  ;  it is possible enough to say something of the
 literary quality of a work that appeared yesterday. Stevenson himself
 was singularly free from the vanity of fame ; " the best artist," he
               " is not the man who fixes his eye on posterity, but the
 says truly,
 one who loves the practice of his art." He loved, if ever man did,
 the practice of his art; and those who find meat and drink in the
 delight of watching and appreciating the skilful practice of the literary
 art, will abandon themselves to the enjoyment of his masterstrokes
 without teasing their unborn and possibly illiterate posterity to
 answer solemn questions.        Will a book live ? Will a cricket match
 live ? Perhaps not, and yet both be fine achievements.
      It is not easy to estimate the loss to letters by his early death.
 In the dedication of ' Prince Otto ' he says, " Well, we will not give
 in that we are finally beaten. . . .
                                        •
                                           I  still mean to get my health
 again ;   I still purpose, by hook or crook, this book or the next, to
 launch a masterpiece."       It would be a churlish or a very dainty critic
 who should deny that he has launched masterpieces, but whether
 he ever launched his masterpiece is an open question.        Of the story
 that he was writing just before his death he is reported to have said
 that " the goodness of it frightened him." A goodness that frightened
 him will surely not be visible, like Banquo's ghost, to only one pair
 of eyes. His greatest was perhaps yet to come. Had Dryden died
 at his age, we should have had none of the great satires ; had Scott
 died at his age, we should have had no Waverley Novels. Dying at
 the height of his power, and in the full tide of thought and activity,
 he seems almost to have fulfilled the aspiration and unconscious
 prophecy of one of the early essays : —
     " Does not life go down with a better grace foaming in full body
 over a precipice, than miserably straggling to an end in sandy deltas ?
     " When the Greeks made their fine saying that those whom the
 gods love die young,     I  cannot help believing that they had this sort
of death also in their eye. For surely, at whatever age it overtake
the man, this is to die young. Death has not been suffered to take so
much as an illusion from his heart. In the hot-fit of life, a-tiptoc on
the highest point of being, he passes at a bound on to the other side.
The noise of the mallet and chisel is scarcely quenched, the trumpets
are hardly done blowing, when, trailing with him clouds of glory, this
happy starred, full-blooded spirit shoots into the spiritual land."
     But we on this side are the poorer — by how much we can
never know. What strengthens the conviction that ho might yet
have surpassed himself and dwarfed his own best work is, certainly
no immaturity, for the flavour of wisdom and old experience hangs
about his earliest writings, but a vague sense awakened by that
brilliant series of books, so diverse in theme, so slight often in struc
ture and occasion, so gaily executed, that here was a finished literary
craftsman, who had served his period of apprenticeship and was
playing with his tools.       The pleasure of wielding the graving tool,
the itch of craftmanship, was strong upon him, and many of the

 works he has left are the overflow of a laughing energy, arabesques
 carved on the rock in the artist's painless hours.
      All art, it is true, is play of a sort; the "sport-impulse" (to
 translate a German phrase) is deep at the root of the artist's power ;
 Sophocles, Shakespeare, Moliere, and Goethe, in a very profound
 sense, made game of life.        But to make game of life was to each of
 these the very loftiest and most imperative employ to be found for
 him on this planet ; to hold the mirror up to Nature so that for the
                                                                                  "
 first time she may see herself, to " be a candle-holder and look on
 at the pageantry which, but for the candle-holder, would huddle
 along in the undistinguishable blackness, filled them with the pride of
 place.   Stevenson had the sport-impulse at the depths of his nature,
 but he also had, perhaps he had inherited, an instinct for work in
 more blockish material, for lighthouse-building and iron-founding.
 In a ' Letter to a Young Artist,' contributed to a magazine years
 ago, he compares the artist in paint or in words to the keeper of a
 booth at the world's fair, dependent for his bread on his success in
amusing others.        In his volume of poems he almost apologises for
his excellence in literature : —
                " Say not of me, that weakly   I declined
                  The labours of my sires, and fled the sea,
                  The towers we founded, and the lumps we lit,
                  To play at home with paper like a child ;
                  But rather say : In the afternoon of time
                  A strenuous family dusted from its hands
                  A sand of granite, and beholding far
                  Along the sounding coasts its pyramids
                  And tall memorials catch the dying sun.
                  Smiled well content, and to this childish task
                  Around the fire addressed its evening hours."
Some    of his works are, no doubt, best described           as paper-games.     In
' The                     for instance, there is something very like the
         Wrong Box,'
card-game commonly called
                                 " Old Maid " ; the odd card is a
                                                                       superfluous
corpse, and each dismayed recipient in turn assumes a disguise and
a pseudonym and bravely passes on that uncomfortable inheritance.
It is an admirable farce, hardly touched with grimness, unshaken by
the breath of reality, full of fantastic character ; the strange funeral
procession is attended by shouts of glee at each of its stages, and
finally melts into space.
     But, when all is said, it is not with work of this kind that
Olympus is stormed ; art must be brought closer into relation with
life, these airy and delightful freaks of fancy must be subdued to a
serious scheme if they are to serve as credentials for a seat among
the immortals.       The decorative painter, whose pencil runs so freely
in limning these half-human processions of outlined fauns and wood-
nymphs, is asked at last to paint an easel-picture.
     Stevenson is best where he shows most restraint, and his pecu

  them to the trim similitude of a Dutch garden.                        His bountiful and

                                                               —
 generally under glass, in the front window the shrine of the un
 known god of art ; the sombre invariable citizen, whose garb gives
  no suggestion of his occupation or his tastes— a person, it would
 seem, only by courtesy ; the piano-organ the music of the day, and
 the hideous voice of the vendor of halfpenny papers the music of the
 night ; could anything be less promising than such a row of houses
 for the theatre of romance ? Set a realist to walk down one of these
 streets : he will inquire about milk bills and servants' wages, latch
 keys and Sunday avocations, and come back with a tale of small
 meannesses and petty respectabilities written in the approved modern
 fashion. Yet Stevenson, it seems likely, could not pass along such
a line of brick bandboxes without having his pulses set a-throbbing
 by the imaginative possibilities of the place. Of his own Lieutenant
Brackenbury Eich he says :—
       " The succession of faces in the lamplight stirred the lieutenant's
 imagination ; and it seemed to him as if he could walk for ever in
 that stimulating city atmosphere and surrounded by the mystery of
four million private lives. He glanced at the houses and marvelled
what was passing behind those warmly lighted windows ; he looked
into face after face, and saw them each intent upon some unknown
interest, criminal or kindly."
      It  was that same evening that Prince Florizel's friend, under the
name of Mr. Morris, was giving a party in one of the houses of West
Kensington.        In one at least of the houses of that brick wilderness
human spirits were being tested as on an anvil, and most of them
tossed aside.       So also, in 'The Rajah's Diamond,' it was a quiet
suburban garden that witnessed the sudden apparition of Mr. Harry
Hartley and his treasures precipitated over the wall ; it was in the

 584                       Professor Walter Raleigh                        [May 17,
 same garden that the Rev. Simon Rolles suddenly, to his own surprise,
 became a thief.      A monotony of bad building is no doubt a bad thing,
 but   it cannot paralyse the activities or frustrate the agonies of the
 mind of man.
       To a man with Stevenson's              live and searching imagination,
 every    work  of human    hands    became     vocal with possible associations.
 Buildings positively     chattered    to   him   ; the little inn at Queensferry,
 which even for Scott had meant only mutton and currant jelly, with
 cranberries " vera weel preserved," gave him the cardinal incident
     '
 of    Kidnapped.' How should the world ever seem dull or sordid to
 one whom a railway station would take into its confidence, to whom
 the very flagstones of the pavement told their story ; in whose mind,
 " the effect of night, of any flowing water, of lighted cities, of the

      His attitude towards the surprising and momentous gift of life
was one prolonged passion of praise and joy.                 There is none of his
books that reads like the meditations of an invalid.                   He has the
readiest sympathy for all exhibitions of impulsive energy ; his heart
 goes out to a sailor, and leaps into ecstasy over a generous adven
turer or buccaneer. Of one of his earlier books he says : " From the
negative point of view        I  flatter myself this volume has a certain
stamp.      Although it runs to considerably upwards of two hundred
pages, it contains not a single reference to the imbecility of God's
universe, nor so much as a single hint that           I  could have made a better
one myself."       And this was an omission that he never remedied in
his later works.       Indeed, his zest in life, whether lived in the back
gardens of a town or on the high seas, was so great that it seems
 probable the writer would have been lost had the man been dowered
 with better health.
                   " Whereas  my birth and spirit rather took
                       The way that takes the town,
                     Thou didst betray me to a ling'ring book,
                       And wrap me in a gown,"
says George Herbert, who, in his earlier ambitions, would fain have
ruffled it with the best at the court of King James. But from
 Stevenson, although not only the town, but oceans and continents,
 beckoned him to deeds, no such wail escaped. His indomitable
cheerfulness was never embarked in the cock-boat of his own pros
perity. A high and simple courage shines through all his writings.
It is supposed to be a normal human feeling for those who are hale
to sympathise with others who are in pain.                 Stevenson reversed the
position, and there is      no  braver     spectacle    in  literature than to see
him not asking others to lower their voices in his sick-room, but
raising his own voice that he may make them feel at ease and

                                                                       '

groaning aloud     with  physical pain,"     he says  in the  essay on   Child's
Play,' " a young gentleman came into the room and nonchalantly
             I
inquired if had seen his bow and arrow.               He made no account of
my groans, which he accepted, as he had to accept so much else, as
a piece of the inexplicable conduct of his elders ; and, like a wise
young gentleman, he would waste no wonder on the subject."                 Was
there ever a passage like this?            The sympathy of the writer is
wholly with the child, and the child's absolute indifference to his
own sufferings.      It might have been safely predicted that this man,
should he ever attain to pathos, would be freo from the facile, maudlin
pathos of the hired sentimentalist.
     And so, also, with what Dr. Johnson has called " metaphysical
distresses."   It is striking enough to observe how differently the quiet
monasteries of the Carthusian and Trappist brotherhoods affected
Matthew Arnold and Robert Louis Stevenson.                  In his well-known
elegiac stanzas Matthew Arnold likens his own state to that of the
monks: —
                "  Wandering between two worlds, one dead,
                  The other powerless to be born,
                  With nowhere yet to rest my head,
                  Like these on earth I wait forlorn.
                  Their faith, my tears, the world deride, —
                                                      "
                  I come to shed them at their side !
To   Stevenson, on the other hand, our Lady of the Snows is a
mistaken divinity, and the place a monument of chilly error, — for
once in a way he takes it upon himself to bo a preacher, his tem
perament gives voice in a creed :—
                     "And ye, O brethren, what if God,

And the fact of death, which has damped and darkened the writings
of  so many    minor poets, does not cast         a  pallor on his conviction.
Life is of value, only because it can           be  spent, or given ; and the
love of God coveted the position, and assumed mortality.             If a man
treasure and hug his life, one thing only is certain, that he will be
robbed some day, and cut the pitiable and futile figure of one who
has been saving candle-ends in a house that is on fire.            Better than
this to have a foolish spendthrift blaze and the loving cup going
round.    Stevenson speaks almost with a personal envy of the conduct
of the four marines of the Wager. There was no room for them in
the boat, and they were left on a desert island to a certain death.
" They were soldiers, they said, and knew well enough it was their
business to die ; and as their comrades pulled away, they stood upon
                                                                              '
the beach, gave three cheers, and cried, ' God bless the king !
Now, one or two of those who were in the boat escaped, against all
likelihood, to tell the story. That was a great thing for us "•—even
when life is extorted it may be given nobly, with ceremony and
courtesy.     So strong was Stevenson's admiration for heroic graces
like these that in the requiem that appears in his poems he speaks
of an ordinary death as of a hearty exploit, and draws his figures
from lives of adventure and toil : —
                   " Under  the wide and starry sky
                     Dig the grave and let me lie.
                     Glad did I live and gladly die,
                         And I laid me down with a will.
                     This be the verse you grave for me :
                     Here he lies where he longed to be,
                     Home is the sailor, home from the sea.
                         And the hunter home from the hill."
 This man should surely have been honoured with the pomp and
 colour and music of a soldier's funeral.
     The most remarkable feature of the work he has left is its singular
 combination of style and romance.             It has so happened, and the
 accident has gained almost the strength of a tradition, that the most
 assiduous followers of romance have been careless stylists.              They
 have trusted to the efficacy of their situation and incident, and have
 too often cared little about the manner of its presentation.            By an
 odd piece of irony, style has been left to the cultivation of those who
 have little or nothing to tell.       Sir Walter Scott himself, with all his
 splendid   romantic    and   tragic   gifts, often, in Stevenson's perfectly
just phrase,   " fobs us  off with   languid and inarticulate twaddle." He
 wrote carelessly   and   genially, and then breakfasted, and began the

 business of the day.           But Stevenson, who had romance tingling in
 every vein of his body, set himself laboriously and patiently to train
 his other faculty, the faculty of style.
                                            I. Style.
      Let no one say that "reading and writing comes by nature,"
 unless he is prepared to be classed with the foolish burgess who said
 it first.     A poet is born, not made — so is every man — but he is
 born raw. Stevenson's life was a grave devotion to the education of
 himself in the art of writing.
                   " The lyf   so short, the craft so long to lerne,
                     Thassiiy so hard, so sharp the conquering."
 Those who deny the necessity, or decry the utility, of such an
 education, are generally deficient in a sense of what makes good
 literature — they are " word-deaf," as others are colour-blind.                    All
 writing is a kind of word-weaving; a skilful writer will make a
 splendid tissue out of the diverse fibres of words. But to care for
 words, to select them judiciously and lovingly, is not in the least
 essential to all writing, all speaking ; for the sad fact is this, that
 most of us do our thinking, our writing, and our speaking in phrases,
 not in words.       The work of a feeble writer is always a patchwork of
phrases,     some  of  them borrowed from the imperial texture of Shake
 speare    and  Milton,  others picked up from the rags in the street. We
 make our very kettle-holders of pieces of a king's carpet.                       How
 many overworn quotations from Shakespeare suddenly leap into
 meaning and brightness when they are seen in their contest! "The
                                   ' "     " More honoured in the breach than the
cry is still, ' They come !            ;

                                              and ' Hamlet casts shame upon their
                                           '                 '
dramatic context in ' Macheth
daily degraded employments.                   But the man of affairs has neither the
time to fashion his speech, nor the knowledge to choose his words,
so he borrows his sentences ready made, and applies them in rough
haste to purposes that they do not exactly fit. Such a man inevitably
repeats, like the cuckoo, monotonous catchwords, and lays his eggs
of thought in the material that has been woven into consistency by
others.      It is a matter of natural taste, developed and strengthened
by continual practice, to avoid being the unwitting slave of phrases.
     The artist in words, on the other hand, although he is a lover of
fine phrases, in his word-weaving experiments uses no shoddy, but
cultivates his senses of touch and sight until he can combine the raw
fibres in novel and bewitching patterns.                  To this end he must have
two things : a fine sense, in the first place, of the sound, value,
meaning, and associations of individual words, and next, a sense of
harmony, proportion, and effect in their combination.                   It is amazing
what nobility a mere         truism      is  often found  to   possess when it is clad
with a garment thus woven.

588                       Professor Walter Rahigh                    [May   17,
     Stevenson had both these sensitive capabilities in a very high
degree.     His careful choice of epithet and name have even been
criticised as lending to some of his narrative-writing an excessive air
of deliberation. His daintiness of diction is best seen in his earlier
work ; thereafter his writing became more vigorous and direct, fitter
for its later uses, but never unillumined by felicities that cause a
thrill of pleasure to the reader. Of the value of words he had the
                            '
acutest appreciation.         Virginibus Puerisque,' his first book of essays,
is crowded with happy hits and subtle implications conveyed in a
single word.       "We have all heard," he says in one of these, "of
cities in South America built upon the side of fiery mountains, and
how, even in this tremendous neighbourhood, the inhabitants are not
a jot more impressed by the solemnity of mortal conditions than if
they were delving gardens in the greenest corner of England."              You
can feel the ground shake and see the volcano tower above you at
that word " tremendous neighbourhood." Something of the same
double reference to the original and acquired meanings of a word is
to be found in such a phrase as " sedate electrician," for one who in
a back office wields all the lights of a city ; or in that description of
one drawing near to death, who is spoken of as groping already with
his hands " on the face of the impassable."           The likeness of this last
word to a very different word, " impassive," is made to do good literary
service in suggesting the sphinx-like image of death.           Sometimes, as
here, this subtle sense of double meanings almost leads to punning.
In ' Across the Plains ' Stevenson narrates how a bet was transacted
at a railway station, and subsequently, he supposes, " liquidated at
the bar." This is perhaps an instance of the excess of a virtue, but
it is an excess to be found plentifully in the works of Milton.
     His loving regard for words bears good fruit in his later and
more stirring works.          He has a quick ear and appreciation for live
phrases    on  the   lips  of   tramps, beach-combers, or Americans. In
'                          '
  The Beach of Falesa the sea captain who introduces the new trader
to the South Pacific island, where the scene of the story is laid,
gives a brief description of the fate of the last dealer in copra.            It
may serve as a single illustration of volumes of racy, humorous, and
imaginative slang : —
     " ' Do you catch a bit of white there to the east'ard ? " the captain

and a wealth of Scottish dialect, similar in effect, in Kidnapped,'
'

trained by practice that picked up these vivid turns of speech, some
of them perhaps heard only once, and a mind given to dwell on
words, that remembered them for years, and brought them out when
occasion arose.
     But the praise of Stevenson's style cannot be exhausted in a de
scription of his use of individual words or his memory of individual
phrases.     His mastery of syntax, the orderly and emphatic arrange
ments of words in sentences, a branch of art so seldom mastered, was
even greater.      And here he could owe no great debt to his romantic
predecessors    in  prose.    Dumas, it is true, is a master of narrative,
but he wrote in French, and a style will hardly bear expatriation.
Scott's sentences are, many of them, shambling, knock-kneed
giants.    Stevenson harked further back for his models, and fed his
style on the most vigorous of the prose writers of the seventeenth
and early eighteenth centuries, the golden age of English prose.
" What English those fellows wrote ! " says Fitzgerald in one of his
             I

he quotes a passage from Harrington's ' Oceana : —
                                                       '
      " This free-born Nation lives not upon the dole or Bounty of One
Man, but distributing her Annual Magistracies and Honours with
her own hand, is herself King People."
     It was from writers of Harrington's time and later that Stevenson
learned something of his craft. Bunyan and Defoe should be parti
cularly mentioned, and that later excellent worthy, Captain Charles
Johnson, who compiled the ever-memorable ' Lives of Pirates and
Highwaymen.'        Mr. George Meredith is the chief of those very few
modern writers whose influence may be detected in his style.
     However it was made, and whencesoever the material or suggestion
borrowed, he came by a very admirable instrument for the telling of
 stories.   Those touches of archaism that are so frequent with him,
the slightly unusual phrasing, or unexpected inversion of the order
of words, show a mind alert in its expression, and give the sting of
novelty even to the commonplaces of narrative or conversation.           A
nimble literary tact will work its will on the phrases of current
 small-talk, remoulding them nearer to the heart's desire, transforming
them to its own stamp.         This was what Stevenson did, and the very
conversations that pass between his characters have an air of dis
 tinction that is all his own. His books are full of brilliant talk —
 talk real and convincing enough in its purport and setting, but purged
 of the languors and fatuities of actual commonplace conversation. It
is an enjoyment like that to be obtained from a brilliant exhibition
 of fencing, clean and dexterous, to assist at the talking bouts of

life— " 'tis true, 'tis pity ; and pity 'tis, 'tis true." They do not ; in
actual life conversation is generally so smeared and blurred with
stupidities, so invaded and dominated by the spirit of dulness, so
liable to swoon into meaninglessness, that to turn to Stevenson's
books is like an escape into mountain air from the stagnant vapours
of a morass. The exact reproduction of conversation as it occurs in
life can only be undertaken by one whose natural dulness feels itself
incommoded by wit and fancy as by a grit in the eye.            Conversation
is often no more than a nervous habit of body, like twiddling the
thumbs, and to record each particular remark is as much as to describe
each particular twiddle.      Or in its more intellectual uses, when speech
is employed, for instance, to conceal our thoughts, how often is it a
world too wide for the shrunken nudity of the thought it is meant to

                                 II.      Romance.
     The faculty of romance, the greatest of the gifts showered on
Stevenson's cradle by the fairies, will suffer no course of develop
ment ; the most that can be done with it is to preserve it on from
childhood unblemished and undiminished. It is of a piece with
Stevenson's romantic ability that his own childhood never ended ; he
could pass back into that airy world without an effort. In his stories,
his imagination worked on the old lines, but it became conscious of
its working. And the highest note of these stories is not drama, nor
character, but romance.        In one of his essays he defines the highest
achievement of romance to be the embodiment " of character, thought,
or emotion in some act or attitude that shall be remarkably striking
to the mind's eye."        His essay on Victor Hugo shows how keenly
conscious he was that narrative romance can catch and embody
emotions and effects that are for ever out of the reach of the drama
proper, and of the essay or homily, just as they are out of the reach
of sculpture and painting. Now, it is precisely in these effects that
the chief excellence of romance resides ; it was the discovery of a
world of these effects, insusceptible of treatment by the drama,
neglected entirely by the character-novel,            which constituted the
Romantic    revival  of  the  end of  last  century. " The artistic result of
a romance," says     Stevenson,     " what is left upon the memory by any
powerful and artistic novel, is something so complicated and refined
that it is difficult to put a name upon            it,
                                                 and yet something as simple
as nature. .    . . The fact    is,that art    working far ahead of language
                                                  is
as well as of science, realising for us, by all manner of suggestions
and exaggerations, effects for which as yet we have no direct name,
for the reason that these effects do not enter very largely into the
necessities of life.     Hence alone is that suspicion of vagueness that
often hangs about the purpose of           romance
                                           a               clear enough to us
                                                           ;   it   is
in thought,   but  we   are   not used  to  consider anything clear until we
are able to formulate  it    in words, and analytical language has not been
sufficiently shaped to that end." He goes on to point out that there
is  an epical value about every great romance, an underlying idea,
not presentable always in abstract or critical terms, in the stories
of such masters of pure romance as Victor Hugo and Nathaniel
Hawthorne.
    The progress of romance in the present century has consisted
chiefly in the discovery of new exercises of imagination and new
subtle effects in story.  Fielding, as Stevenson says, did not under
stand that the nature of    landscape or the spirit of the times could
                            a
count for anything in   astory all his actions consist of
                                      ;                     few simple   a
personal elements.    With Scott, vague influences that qualify man's        a
personality begin to make     large claim " the individual characters
                                a                      ;
begin to occupy   a comparatively small proportion of that canvas on
which armies manoeuvre and great hills pile themselves upon each
other's shoulders."   And the achievements of the great masters since

Scott — Hugo, Dumas, Hawthorne, to name only those in Stevenson's
direct line of ancestry — have added new realms to the domain of
romance.
     What are the indescribable effects that romance, casting far beyond
problems of character and conduct, seeks to realise? What is the
nature of the great informing, underlying idea that animates a truly
                                                       ' Monte Christo,'
great romance — The Bride of Lammermoor,'
                   '
' Les Miserables,' ' The Scarlet Letter,' ' The Master of Ballantrae ' ?
These questions can only be answered by deforming the impression
given by each of these works to present it in the chop-logic language
of philosophy. But an approach to an answer may be made by
illustration.
     In his ' American Notebooks ' Nathaniel Hawthorne used to jot
down subjects for stories as they struck him. His successive entries
are like the souls of stories awaiting embodiment, which many of
them never received ; they bring us very near to the workings of the
mind of a great master. Here are some of them :—
     " A sketch to be given of a modern reformer,  a type  of the extreme
doctrines on the subject of slaves, cold water, and the like. He goes
about the streets haranguing most eloquently, and is on the point of
making many converts, when his labours are suddenly interrupted by
the appearance of the keeper of a madhouse whence he has escaped.
Much may be made of this idea."
     " The scene of a story or sketch to be laid within the light of a
street lantern ; the time, when the lamp is near going out ; and the
catastrophe to be simultaneous with the last flickering gleam."
     " A person to be writing a tale and to find it shapes itself against
his intentions ; that the characters act otherwise than he thought,
and a catastrophe comes which he strives in vain to avert.       It might
shadow forth his own fate — he having made himself one of the
personages."
     " Two persons to be expecting some occurrence and watching for
the two principal actors in it, and to find that the occurrence is even
then passing, and that they themselves are the two actors."
     " A satire on ambition and fame from a statuo of snow."
     Hawthorne used this idea in one of his sketches.
     " A moral philosopher to buy a slave, or otherwise get possession
 of a human being, and to use him for the sake of experiment by
 trying the operation of a certain vice on him."
     M. Bourget, the French romancer, has made use of this idea in
 his novel called ' Le Disciple.' Only it is not a slave, but a young
 girl whom he pretends to love, that is the subject of the moral
 philosopher's experiment ; and a noisy war has been waged round the
 book in France. Hawthorne would plainly have seized the romantic
 essence of the idea and would have avoided the boneyard of " problem
morality."
     " A story the principal personage of which shall seem always on
 the point of entering on the scene, but shall never appear."

1895.]                       on Bobert Louis Stevenson.                    693
      This is the device that gives fascination to the figures of Richelieu
                           '
in  ' Marion Delorme and of Captain Flint in ' Treasure Island.'
      " The   majesty of death to be exemplified in a beggar, who, after
being    seen   humble and cringing in the streets of a city for many
years,   at  length by some means or other gets admittance into a rich
man's mansion, and there dies — assuming state, and striking awe into
the breasts of those who had looked down upon him."
      These are all excellent instances of the sort of idea that gives life
to a romance — of acts or attitudes that stamp themselves upon the
mind's eye. Some of them appeal chiefly to the mind's eye, others
are of value chiefly as symbols.          But, for the most part, the romantic
kernel of a story is neither pure picture nor pure allegory, it can
neither be painted nor moralised.               It makes its most irresistible
appeal neither to the eye that searches for form and colour, nor to
 the reason that seeks for abstract truth, but to the blood, to all that
dim instinct of danger, mystery, and sympathy in things that is
man's oldest inheritance — to the superstitions of the heart. Romance
vindicates tho supernatural against science, and rescues it from the
palsied tutelage of morality.
      Stevenson's work is a gallery of romantic effects that haunt the
memory.        Some of these are directly pictorial : the fight in the round
 house on board the brig Covenant; the duel between the two brothers
 of Ballantrae in the island of light thrown up by the candles from
 that abyss of windless night ; the flight of the Princess Seraphina
 through the dark mazes of the wood, — all these, although they carry
 with them subtleties beyond the painter's art, yet have something of
picture in them. But others make entrance to the corridors of the
mind by blind and secret ways, and there awaken the echoes of
primeval fear.         The cry of the parrot — "Pieces of eight" — the
tapping of the stick of the blind pirate Pew as he draws near the inn
parlour, and the similar effects of inexplicable terror wrought by the
introduction of the blind catechist in ' Kidnapped,' and of the disguise
of a blind leper in ' The Black Arrow,' are beyond the reach of any
but the literary form of romantic art.          The last appearance of Pew, in
the play of 'Admiral Guinea,' written in collaboration with Mr. W. E.
Henley, is perhaps the masterpiece of all the scenes of terror. The
blind ruffian's scream of panic fear, when he puts his groping hand
into the burning flame of the candle in the room where he believed
that he was unseen, and so realises that his every movement is
                                          " the horrors come alive."
being silently watched, is indeed
      The animating principle or idea of Stevenson's longer stories is
never to be found in their plot, which is generally built carelessly
and disjointedly enough around the central romantic situation or
conception.       The main situation in 'The Wrecker' is a splendid
product     of  romantic     inspiration, but the structure of the story is
incoherent and       ineffective,  so that some of the best passages in the
book —the scenes in Paris,        for instance — have no business there at all.

  benevolent lives are thrown in his way that he may mock or distort
  or shatter them. Stevenson never came nearer than in this character
  to the sublime of power.

  of its own, and the character of the place seems to impose itself on
  the incidents that occur, dictating subordination or contrast.           The
  events that happen within the limits of one of these magic isles could
 in every case be cut off from the rest of the story and framed as                                a
  separate work of art.     The long starvation of David Balfour on the

       In his search for the treasures of romance, Stevenson adventured
 freely enough into the realm of the supernatural. When he                                        i*
 handling the superstitions of the Scottish people, he allows his
 humorous enjoyment of their extravagance to peep out from behind the
 solemn dialect in which they are dressed. The brief tale of Tbxawn                      '
 Janet,' and Black Andy's story of Tod Lapraik in 'Catriona,' are
 grotesque imaginations of the school of Tam           Shanter rather than
                                                                   o'

 scene in the arbour of Will's Inn.         The wafted scent of the helio
 tropes, which had never been planted in the garden since Marjory's
 death, the light in the room that had been hers, prelude the arrival at
 the gate of the stranger's carriage, with the black pine tops standing
 above it like plumes.      And Will o' the Mill makes the acquaintance
 of his physician and friend, and goes at last upon his travels. In
 the other story, Markheim meets with his own double in the house of
 the dealer in curiosities, whom he has murdered.            It is not such a
 double as Rossetti prayed for to the god of Sleep —
                     " Ah ! might I, by thy good grace,

 but  a clear-eyed critic of the murderer,         not unfriendly, who lays
 bare before him his motives and his history.             At the close of that
 wonderful conversation, one of the most brilliant of its author's
achievements, Markheim gives himself into the hands of the police.
These two stories, when compared with the others, serve to show
how Stevenson's imagination quickened and strengthened when it
played full upon life. For his best romantic effects, like all great
romance, are illuminative of life, and no mere idle games.
                                III.  Morality.
     His  genius, like the genius of Nathaniel Hawthorne, was doubly
rich, in the spirit of romance and in a wise and beautiful morality.
But the irresponsible caprices of his narrative fancy prevented his
tales from being the appropriate vehicles of his morality. He has
left no work —unless the two short stories mentioned above be re
garded as exceptions — in which romance and morality are welded
into a single perfect whole, nothing that can be put beside ' The
Scarlet Letter or ' The Marble Faun for deep insight and magic
                 '                            '
fancy joined in one. Hence his essays, containing as they do the
gist of his reflective wisdom, are ranked by some critics above his
stories.
     A novel cannot, of course, be moral as an action is moral ; there
is no question in art of police regulations or conformity to established
codes, but rather of insight both deep and wide.                Polygamy and
monogamy, suttee, thuggism, and cannibalism, are all acceptable to
the romancer, whose business is with the heart of man in all times
and places. He is not bound to display allegiance to particular
moral laws of the kind that can be broken ; he is bound to show his
consciousness of that wider moral order which can no more be broken
by crime than the law of gravitation can be broken by the fall of

china — the morality without which life would be impossible ; the
relations, namely, of human beings to each other, the feelings,
habits, and thoughts that are the web           of society.      For the apprecia
tion of morality in this wider sense high gifts of imagination are
necessary.       Shakespeare could never have drawn Macheth, and thereby
made apparent the awfulness of murder, without some sympathy for
the murderer — the sympathy of intelligence.              These gifts of imagina
tion and sympathy belong to Stevenson in a very high degree ; in all
his romances there are gleams from time to time of wise and subtle
reflection upon life, from the eternal side of things, which shine the
more luminously that they spring from the events and situations with
no suspicion of homily.           In ' The Black Arrow,' Dick Shelton begs
from the Duke of Gloucester the life of the old shipmaster Arblaster,
whose ship he had taken and accidentally wrecked earlier in the
story. The Duke of Gloucester, who, in his own words,
                                                                        " loves not
mercy nor mercy-mongers,"              yields the favour reluctantly.         Then
 Dick turns to Arblaster.
      " ' Come,' said Dick, ' a life is a life, old shrew, and it is more
 than ships or liquor.       Say you forgive me, for if your life is worth
nothing     to you,  it hath cost me the beginnings of my fortune. Come,
 I  have paid    for it dearly ; be not so churlish.'
               I                                     I
      " ' An' had my ship,' said Arblaster, ' would 'a' been forth and
                              I
 safe on the high seas — and my man Tom.                   But ye took my ship,
 gossip, and I'm a beggar ; and for my man Tom, a knave fellow in
                                '
 russet shot him down.            Murrain,' quoth he, and spake never again.
 'Murrain' was the last of his words, and the poor spirit of him
 passed. 'A will never sail no more, will my Tom.'
      " Dick was seized with unavailing penitence and pity ; he sought
 to take the skipper's hand, but Arblaster avoided his touch.
      " ' Nay,' said he, ' let be. Y' have played the devil with me, and
 let that content you.'
      " The words died in Richard's throat. He saw, through tears,
 the poor old man, bemused with liquor and sorrow, go shambling
 away, with bowed head, across the snow, and the unnoticed dog
 whimpering at his heels; and for the first time began to understand
 the desperate game that we play in life, and how a thing once done
 is not to be changed or remedied by any penitence."
      A similar wisdom that goes to the heart of things is found on the
 lips of the spiritual visitant in ' Markheim.'
      " ' Murder is to me no special category,' replied the other.             ' All
 sins   are   murder,   even as    all  life is war.   I   behold  your race, like
  starving mariners on a raft, plucking crusts out of the hands of
 famine, and feeding on each other's lives.              I  follow sins beyond the
 moment of their acting ;          I  find in all that the last consequence is
  death ; and to my eyes the pretty maid, who thwarts her mother with
  such taking graces on a question of a ball, drips no less visibly with
                                                            "

like these is combined in Stevenson with a vivid interest in, and
quick appreciation of, character. The variety of the characters that
he has essayed to draw is enormous, and his successes, for the purposes
of his stories, are many. Yet with all this, the number of lifelike
portraits, true to a hair, that are to be found in his works, is very
small indeed.      In the golden glow of romance, character is always
 subject  to be idealised  ; it is the effect of character seen at particular
angles and in special lights, natural or artificial, that Stevenson
paints : he does not attempt to analyse the complexity of its elements,
 but boldly projects into it certain principles, and works from those.
 It has often been said of Scott that he could not draw a lady who was
young and beautiful ; the glamour of chivalry blinded him, he lowered
 his eyes and described his emotions and aspirations.           Something of
the same disability afflicted Stevenson in the presence of a ruffian.
He loved heroic vice only less than he loved heroic virtue, and was
always ready to idealise his villains, to make of them men who, like
the Master of Ballantrae, "lived for an idea."             Even the low and
lesser villainy of Israel     Hands,   in the great scene where he climbs
the mast to murder the hero of ' Treasure Island,' breathes out its
soul in a creed : —
     " ' For thirty years,' he said, ' I've sailed the seas, and seen good
and bad, better and worse, provisions running out, knives going, and
what not. Well, now,          I                I
                              tell you, never seen good come o' goodness

some definite principles of criticism have been discovered to guide
us among those perilous passes.
     One character must never be passed over in an estimate of
Stevenson's work.       The hero of his longest work is not David
Balfour, in whom the pawky Lowland lad, proud and precise, but
" a very pretty gentleman," is transfigured at times by traits that he
catches, as narrator of the story, from its author himself.      But Alan
Breck Stewart is a greater creation, and a fine instance of that wider
morality that can seize by sympathy the soul of a wild Highland
clansman.      "Impetuous, insolent, unquenchable,"        a condoner    of
murder (for " them that havenae dipped their hands in any little
difficulty should be very mindful of the case of them that have "), a
confirmed gambler, as quarrelsome as a turkey-cock, and as vain and
sensitive as a child, Alan Breck is one of the most lovable characters
in all literature ; and his penetration — a great part of which he
learned, to take his own account of         by driving cattle " through

thing has never yet been done. A great part of Stevenson's subtle
wisdom of life finds its readiest outlet in his essays.          In these,
whatever their occasion, he shows himself the clearest-eyed critic of
human life, never the dupe of the phrases and pretences, the theories
and conventions, that distort the vision of most writers and thinkers.
He has an unerring instinct for realities, and brushes aside all else
with rapid grace. In his lately published Amateur Emigrant               he

nothing in the world but money and steam engines.              He did not
know what you meant by the word happiness.               He had forgotten
 the simple emotions of childhood, and perhaps never encountered the
delights of youth. He believed in production, that useful figment
of economy, as           had been real, like laughter and production,
                          if   it                                    ;
without prejudice to liquor, was his god and guide."
     This sense of the realities of the world — laughter, happiness, tho
simple emotions of childhood, and others — makes Stevenson an
admirable critic of those social pretences that ape the native qualities
of the heart. The criticism on organised philanthropy contained in
the essay on Beggars         not exhaustive,

whiff or taint of indecent familiarity, no puling and no posing, — the
shores of the sea of literature are strewn with the wrecks and forlorn
properties of those who have adventured on this dangerous attempt.
But a criticism of Stevenson is happy in this, that from the writer it
can pass with perfect trust and perfect fluency to the man. He shares
with Goldsmith and Montaigne, his own favourite, the happy privilege
of making lovers among his readers. " To be the most beloved of

             The Absolute Measurement              of Electrical Resistance.
If we take     a conductor, such as this piece of copper wire, and make
it part of   a conducting circuit in which an electric current is flowing,
we find that the electromotive-force           between its extremities is pro
portional    to  the  strength    of the   current   passing through         so long it,
as it  remains in the same physical condition.                   If
                                                                either the electro
motive-force or the current strength varies, the other of these
quantities varies in like proportion. Their ratio                     is
                                                                   constant,     e.        i.    it
has  a  value independent of them, and depending only on the dimen
sions of the conductor, the nature of the material of which                    made,
                                                                                 it    is
the state of aggregation of its parts, and its temperature.
     This ratio    iscalled the electrical resistance of the conductor, and
so defined   it  corresponds to      real physical quantity —
                                        a                                  physical
                                                                           it   is
                                                                                 a
property of the conductor.
     Probably no physical measurement can be made with greater
accuracy than the comparison of electrical resistances.                 Such com
parisons   are  daily  made   in  many    parts  of  the  world,  and         clearly
                                                                                it   is
desirable, in order that the results obtained by one man may have
meaning for others, that all should make their reckoning in terms of
the same unit. Accordingly, the scientific world has given great
attention to the definition of such               unit, and much international
                                                   a
negotiation has taken place with                 view of securing world-wide
                                                   a
agreement on this point.
     The most obvious method of procedure                  to fix upon some con
                                                           is
venient conductor as standard, and to call its electrical resistance
                                a

then expressed as so many times or such and such                    fraction of the
                                                                       a
resistance of this standard      conductor.
     The disadvantage of this method of defining the unit                  that the
                                                                                 is

consequent on change of temperature              this may, however, be allowed
                                                   ;
for by defining the unit as the electrical resistance of the standard
conductor when          it   at is  specified temperature.

changes    of  physical   condition,  changes     in  the state  of  aggregation of
the parts   of  the  conductor,   effects  of  strain,   alterations  of molecular
structure,    &c., are  more    serious,  because     they  are  unknown,    and we
cannot in our definition provide against unknown possible changes.

602                          Mr. J.   Viriamu Jones                    [May   24,
We run the risk, therefore, of having a varying unit, and the prime
requisite of a unit is constancy.
     In England the Government has taken this risk, and committed
itself— at least for the present— to this method of specifying the unit
of electrical resistance.
      The denomination of the standard of electrical resistance contained
in   the  recent Order in Council regarding Standards for Electrical
Measurements is as follows :—
      " A standard of electrical resistance denominated one ohm, heing
the resistance between the copper terminals of the       '
                                                             instrument marked
' Board of Trade Ohm Standard Verified, 1894 to the passage of an
unvarying electrical current, when the coil of insulated wire forming
part of the aforesaid instrument and connected to the aforesaid
terminals is in all parts at a temperature of 15 'i° C."
      This is a plain adoption of an arbitrary standard. The resistance
of a certain piece of wire wound into a coil is made the legal unit, and
if this resistance varies our legal unit varies with it.
      It is true that in constructing the standard, efforts have been made
 to ensure that its resistance shall be equal to 1000 million times the
absolute unit of which I shall presently speak
                                                       — that the standard was
 in construction based upon      the   ohm  ; but there   is no provision in the
 Order in Council for revision        if the  standard   varies,  nor indeed has
 the Government any means at its disposal            of  directly measuring its
 standard    in absolute measure.
      I seem   to be finding fault.    That is not my intention.       I am only
 advocating     progress.    The    time   is ripe  for    the  adoption   of the
 absolute   unit, not merely nominally    but  really, for  the frank acceptance
 of the absolute unit itself as the ultimate legal standard.
      Now, what is an absolute unit? The following considerations
 affecting physical measurements generally will,          I  hope, serve to make
 this clear.
      In order to specify the magnitude of any physical quantity, we
 bring it into relation with a standard magnitude of the same kind,
 called the unit, and say that it is so many times or such and such a
 fraction of this unit. Thus we speak of a length of 6 centimetres,
 a mass of 50 grammes, a time of 20 seconds, an electric current of
  10 amperes, an electrical resistance of 30 ohms, and so on.
       For the purpose of this specification any convenient magnitude
  of the physical quantity to be measured may be taken as the unit.
      But science has to deal with many kinds of quantities, and when
  we consider the various units as constituting a system, our arbitrary
  choice is limited by two conditions of fundamental importance :
                                                                            —
       1. The units must be chosen so as to simplify as far as may be
  the statement of the quantitative relations existing between various
  kinds of quantities.
                                                             —
       Physical science, in so far as it is quantitative may we not say in
                               —
  so far as it is perfected ? tells us of relations of interdependence
  between many different      kinds   of quantities.     Thus, in geometry wo

 1895.]     on the Absolute Measurement    of Electrical Resistance.      603
 have such relations between lengths, areas, and volumes ; in kine
 matics, relations between these mathematical quantities and times,
 velocities, and accelerations ; in dynamics, between these mathe
 matical and kinematical quantities and mass, momentum, force, work,
 and energy ; in electrical and magnetic science, relations between the
 foregoing quantities and electrical and magnetic magnitudes ; and
 so on.
     These relations of interdependence are expressed in equations, and
it is of obvious advantage, both for ease of arithmetical calculation
 and clearness of thought, to rid these equations as far as possible of
 superfluous arithmetical constants.       This may be done by a judicious
 selection of units, by making the       units of the quantities that appear
most complex in their relations of interdependence depend upon the
 units of the quantities that appear in their nature to bo simplest.       A
unit of any quantity so defined with reference to the units of quanti
ties apparently simpler is called a derived unit with reference to the
latter units as fundamental.
     Thus, the attraction of the earth on a mass of 1 lb. — the weight
of 1 lb. — is an arbitrary unit of force. The force that, acting on a
mass of 1 lb., increases its velocity by 1 ft. per second every second
is a derived unit of force with reference to the units of length, time,
and mass, as fundamental.        It is usually called the absolute unit of
force on the pound-foot-second system ; and by the very nature of its
definition it gets rid of an arbitrary constant in the relation between
force, mass, and acceleration.      If the arbitrary unit of force mentioned
above — the gravitation unit — is used instead of the absolute unit, our
dynamical equations are uselessly complicated by the introduction of
" g," the acceleration of gravity at the particular point of the earth's
surface at which we happen to be, and at the particular time when
our measurements happen to be made.
     2. The second condition of prime importance to a scientific system
of units is that the units of all quantities should bo invariable, un
affected by conditions of time and place, and independent of the
properties of particular bodies, i. e. they should be absolute.          The
                    "
word " absolute is in philosophy opposed to " conditioned." When
it is applied to a unit in science the implication should be that the
unit is the same at all times and in all places, and that it is uncon
ditioned by the properties of any specified body or bodies, i. o. that its
magnitude is brought into relation with and depends upon only the
most permanent phenomena of the universe.
     The modern system of absolute units goes far to fulfil the first
of our two requirements ; it only very partially fulfils the second.
     When we speak of an absolute unit at present we mean a unit
the magnitude of which deponds on nothing elso than the units of
length, time, and mass, and the properties of the ether. Tho latter
may be regarded as universal enough, but the units of length, mass,
and time are arbitrary standards.          The metre depends on tho pro
perties   of a particular bar, tho gramme on the properties of a particular

piece of platinum, the mean solar second on particular bodies of the
solar system.
     The time will come when we shall be able to take another step
forward, when we shall be in a position to make the unit of mass a
derived unit with reference to the units of length and time as
fundamental through that universal uniformity of nature — the law of
gravitation ; the units of length and time being based on some more
permanent phenomena of the universe (the properties of the sodium
molecule have, for instance, been suggested) than the length of a
particular bar, and the motion of the earth on which we live.
     But we cannot take this step forward yet. We do not know
either the gravitation constant or the velocity of light with sufficient
accuracy to enable us to define by means of them units precise enough
to meet the needs of practical life.      Yet the fact that if we knew
these constants we could make an important advance in the realisation
of a system of absolute measurement is an excellent reason why the
masters of physical measurement should apply themselves to their
precise determination.
     The use of a derived unit of mass would have this among other
advantages, it would rationalise the dimensions of the electric and
magnetic units in length and time, and relegate the irrationality to
the ether, to which  I believe it properly belongs.
     We must, however, for the present be content with a less com
plete reference to the most permanent phenomena of the universe, and
by absolute measurement to-night      I mean measurement in terms of a
unit derived with reference to the unit of length, time, and mass as
fundamental —i. e. a unit conditioned only by these units, and the
properties of the ether.
     There is such a unit of electrical resistance —a unit derived with
reference to the units of length and time as fundamental — the magni
tude of which is independent of the properties of any particular
conductor, any particular coil of wire, and is conditioned only by the
units of length and time, and the properties of the ether.
     It may, indeed, at first sight seem astonishing that a quantity so
different can be expressed in terms of a length and a time.     Yet so it
is. We can, in virtue of experiments made 63 years ago in this
Institution by Michael Faraday, measure the resistance of a con
ductor with the help of no other standardising instruments than a
tape or measuring machine and a clock. An electrical resistance is
always proportional to a certain velocity, and if the magnetic permea
bility of the ether be taken to be unity, the number expressing the
electrical resistance will be the same as the number expressing that
velocity ; the unit of electrical resistance may then be taken to be
the resistance corresponding      to unit velocity — i. e. on the C.G.S.
system a velocity of 1 c. per second, and any electrical resistance
may be conveniently expressed in terms of this unit as so many
centimetres per second.
     [You will observe that     I  do not say electrical resistance is a

 1895.]     on the Absolute Measurement     of Electrical Resistance.   605
 velocity.    That would be to neglect the unknown dimensions of the
 magnetic permeability of the ether.]
     If  the unit of length, the unit of time, and the properties of the
 ether remain constant, this unit of electrical resistance remains con
 stant.    It is unconditioned by the properties of any material, by
 position in space, or point of time, and so far deserves the name of
 the absolute unit of electrical resistance.
     How comes it that resistance can be so measured ? The answer
 to this question is best found in a description of some one of tho
 methods by which the measurement of an electrical resistance in terms
 of the absolute unit can be experimentally made.
     And    I  proceed, therefore, to a description of the method which
 may fairly be described as the simplest, and which, in my opinion,
 having regard to the magnificent possibilities of mechanical engineer
 ing operations in this country, is undoubtedly capable of being made
 the most accurate of all the methods that have been proposed since
 the British Association Committee, more than thirty years ago, pro
pounded the theoretical definition of the absolute unit.
     The method is due to Lorenz ; and Lord Rayleigh, at the conclu
 sion of his masterly determinations of the value of the B.A. coils in
 absolute measure, expressed himself in regard to it as follows : —
     " On the whole,      I  am of opinion that if it is desirable at the
 present time to construct apparatus on the most favourable scale so
as to reach the highest attainable accuracy, the modification of
Lorenz's method last described is the one that offers the best prospect
of success."
     The Paper from which         I quote contained a comparison of the
various methods of measuring resistance in absolute units, and an
invitation to others to join in the work. It was the starting-point of
my own researches in the matter, which have extended over some
years, and    I gladly take the opportunity of thanking Lord Rayleigh
for this source of inspiration.
     Faraday discovered that, if a conductor is made to move in a
magnetic field so as to cut across the flux of magnetic induction, the
conductor becomes the seat of electromotive-force, and that the electro
motive-force so developed is proportional to the rate at which the
induction flux is traversed.
     If, for instance, we take a metal disc and make it rotate about a
horizontal axis n times a second, any radius of the disc cuts through
the earth's induction flux, unless the plane of the disc is in the mag
netic meridian. There will, therefore, be electromotive-force between
the centre and circumference of the disc.           Further, since a radius
traverses the whole area of the disc n times in a second, the rate at

where E! is the electromotive-force   between the centre and circum
ference.
     But we may, instead of using the earth's field, obtain a magnetic
field by means of an electric current. The disc may be made to spin
in the magnetic field due to a current in a coil of wire placed so as to
be co-axial with         it,
                     and so that its middle plane coincides with the
plane of the disc.  In this case the magnetic field    symmetrical with

per second in the induction flux due to the current in the coil,                  I
being the total amount of that flux which passes through the disc
circumference.

portional to the intensity of the magnetic field produced by         at any it
point, and hence the magnetic induction through the disc due to the
current in the coil     proportional to the strength of that current.
                          is
    It follows that the magnetic induction through the disc made             is
up of two factors, viz. the current in the coil and the magnetic induc
tion that would pass through the disc if unit current passed through
the coil. The latter factor       called the coefficient of mutual induc
                                     is
tion of the coil and  disc circumference, and its value depends only on
their dimensions and relative positions, and the magnetic permeability
of the medium in which they are placed.                     If
                                                     the latter quantity           is
taken to be unity, the coefficient of mutual induction       expressible as

a length, and    may be calculated from observations involving nothing
                it

the radius of the disc. Let this coefficient of mutual induction be de
noted by M, and the current in the coil by y,        then   ;

   We have therefore two ways              of expressing the ratio of an electro
motive-force to current.
                     a
      By definition (Ohm's law) this ratio             is   given to us as electrical

product of their coefficient of mutual induction and the rate of rota
tion of the disc (number of turns per second).

      And if the ratio for the disc and coil is made the same as the
 ratio for the resistance (which it is possible in practice to arrange)
 we have
                                    E  =  M».
 If the magnetic permeability of the medium be taken as unity, M is
 a length expressible as so many centimetres, and the number of turns
 per second is the reciprocal of the time of one revolution of the disc.
 Hence the resistance may be expressed as a velocity of M centimetres
in the time of one revolution of the disc. This makes it clear that,
 with the assumption in regard to the permeability of the ether (or air)
that we have made above, any electrical resistance is expressible as a
velocity of so many centimetres per second.
      We can in practice make the ratio for disc and coil the same as
the ratio for the resistance by first sending the same current through
coil and resistance and then varying the speed of the disc so as to
make the electromotive-force        between its centre and circumference
equal   to the  electromotive-force   between the resistance terminals.
      How can we test     the  equality of the two electromotive-forces?
If   two equal electromotive-forces      act in opposite directions in the
same circuit the result is electrical equilibrium.        We have, therefore,
to proceed as follows: — Place the two electromotive-forces            in the
same circuit so as to act in opposite directions ; then if they are the
only electromotive-forces in the circuit, there will be an electric
current round the circuit due to their difference if they are unequal,
and no electric current at all if they are equal. The presence or
absence of a current may be tested by the inclusion of a galvonometer
in the circuit.
     In  practice it is not quite so simple as this, because it is impossible
to make the two electromotive-forces in question the only electro
motive-forces in the circuit. There will be others, and especially
thermo-electric forces, always present. But this difficulty may be
met thus : — Reverse the two electromotive-forces we are comparing ;
if the current in the circuit is not changed by this reversal of both,
they must be equal —i. e. if the reading of the galvanometer be
the same, whether the balancing electromotive-forces              are in one
direction or the other, these electromotive-forces are equal. The
reversal of both our electromotive-forces         may be readily effected in
practice by simply reversing the direction of the current through the
coil and resistance.
     To measure our resistance in absolute measure wo have then —

may be changed at will.

    I             I
       trust that have said sufficient to make clear to you the general
theory of the measurement of a resistance in absolute measure by this
method.     It now remains to consider very briefly the practical side
of the matter, the difficulties that arise, the way in which they may
be met, and the accuracy attainable.     The time at my disposal does
not allow me to do this at all completely, and     I must content myself
with touching on a few points of special importance and interest.
    The first great desideratum is that we should have the rate of
rotation of the disc well under control, that it should run as uniformly
as possible, and that its rate should be capable of sufficiently exact
determination.
    The disc, axle, and bearings in my apparatus at Cardiff are of
phosphor bronze (Figs. 2 and 3). The disc is insulated from the

     It was at first intended to drive the disc by rope gearing from the
electromotor ; but in the course of preliminary experiments, though
the rope was 40 yards long, and joining of the ends took place over
a length of at least 6 feet, there was a sudden variation in speed,

motor    is supplied from secondary cells. It passes to the motor
through resistance coils, and may be increased or diminished by
throwing some of these coils into or out of the circuit. It may also
be varied continuously through a small range by a slide resistance of
platinoid wire after the larger adjustment has been made. A shunt
worked by a lever provides means of taking out or putting in a small
resistance suddenly, so as to allow the observer controlling the speed
while an observation is being taken to counteract small variations of
speed due to alteration in the lubrication of the bearings and the
friction of the brushes on the commutator of the motor.                 With these

1895.]    on  the  Absolute Measurement     of Electrical Resistance.     611
arrangements we can obtain any required rate of rotation from about
150 to 1500 revolutions per minute.
    It is of the greatest importance, if the observations presently to
be described are to be made with ease, that the rate of rotation should
remain constant for the four or five minutes required, and no effort
made to compass such uniformity is thrown away.            The design, work
manship, and lubrication of all the bearings require closest attention,
and the friction between the brushes and the motor commutator should
be reduced to a minimum. In my Cardiff apparatus the axle near
the motor bears a heavy fly-wheel.
     During a run the observer controlling the rate of rotation requires
some test of uniformity, so that he may, if there is a quickening or
slowing down, diminish or increase respectively the current through
the electromotor so as to recover the initial speed.
     To accomplish this it is convenient to refer the rate of rotation
by a stroboscopic method to a suitable tuning fork provided with
riders and maintained in vibration electrically.         Here is such a fork.
At the end of each prong there is an aluminium plate with a slit in
it parallel to the prong. When the fork is in equilibrium the slits
are opposite one another, and an observer can see through both.
When the fork is in vibration he can see through the slits only when
they are opposite one another.          This position occurs twice in every
complete    vibration.    Hence,   if the  number of vibrations per second
is, say, 64, he obtains    128  views  per second.
     Now let us suppose that he looks through the vibrating slits at
a drum or disc coloured black, on which a number of white spaces,
which   I will call teeth, are painted at equal angular intervals.       Here
is such a disc attached to the rotating axle ; on it there are three
circular rows of radial teeth.
     When the disc is in rotation, if the rate of rotation is such that
in the interval between two views a tooth in any row exactly takes
the place of the next, that row will appear, to an observer looking
through the fork slits, stationary ; if it does not quite do so, the row
will appear to be moving backward ; if it passes beyond, the row will
appear to be moving forward.
     These phenomena       I  can show you by illuminating the rotating
 disc by intermittent light. The light of this alternating arc varies
 in intensity at each alternation, passing from maximum to maximum
 through a minimum that is, however, very far from darkness.              Our
 speed is such as to make the row of fourteen teeth appear almost
 stationary in this intermittent light. You can see the teeth, but they
 stand out somewhat faintly.        The faintness is due to the fact that we
 have not complete     darkness   between   the maxima of illumination.
     We may do much          better   with  such a tuning fork as      I have
 described.    I  place its slits in front of this electric lantern, in which
 there is a continuous arc.        The light falling on the disc has passed
 through the slits of the vibrating fork, and by varying the rate of
 revolution we obtain perfectly distinct stationary teeth. Let us

suppose that the fork permits the light to pass through it 128 times
per second, and that the row on the disc which looks stationary has
fourteen teeth on it ; then one tooth takes the place of the next in
f^    a second, but this corresponds to -,'T of a revolution, so that one
revolution is performed in TT54S of a second, and the number of tumi
per second is      -^5"

         n  = the number of turns of the       disc per second,
         Q  = the number of teeth in the       stationary row.
    We may then make the stationariness of a tooth, as seen by an
observer    through the slits, a test of the uniformity of the rate of
rotation.     If  a tooth begins to move past a fixed reference wire placed
immediately      in  front of the rotating disc or drum, the observer can at
once bring it back by altering the current in the motor.*
     If the tuning fork were itself a reliable time indicator to the
degree of accuracy required, we might calculate from its pitch
the speed corresponding to stationariness of a given row of teeth.
But my experience is that the vibration period of a fork maintained
in vibration electrically is not sufficiently constant.        If  stopped and
set going again it may start with a period different from that of its
last performance by several parts in 10,000. No previous deter
mination of the pitch of the fork can therefore be relied on to give as
the rate of rotation to a hundredth per cent., though once started the
fork goes sufficiently uniformly to give us the means of control.
     The period of a bowed fork does not vary in this fashion, but it
is more troublesome to use for the purpose. The constant bowing
required takes too much of the attention of the observer.
     Accordingly, it is necessary to measure the rate of rotation during
each run while the galvanometer observations are being made.               Thii
may    be done    telegraphically    with great accuracy.    The  rotating disc
is by means     of   an eccentric  attached to its axle caused at each revolu
tion to make and break an electric circuit passing through a Bain' s
electro-chemical telegraph instrument.          The standard clock telegraphs
seconds to the same instrument. The two records lie side by side on
the same tape, and simple counting with careful fractional estimate
gives with great precision the mean rate of rotation during the few
minutes occupied in taking a set of galvonometer readings.
     With this means of measuring the rate of rotation we may,

      When      I first began working at this method I found it extremely
 difficult when the disc was in rotation to obtain a steady reading at
 the galvanometer.          My galvanometer is a very sensitive Thomson
 reflecting galvanometer of about 1 ohm resistance, made by Elliott
 Bros, and fitted by my assistant, Mr. Harrison, with a long suspension
 for the support of the needle by a quartz fibre. When the disc was
 in uniform rotation the spot of light roamed continually over 50 or
 100 divisions of the scale, and frequently there were sudden jerks of
 a most embarrassing kind. Readings with a galvanometer so sensitive
 were in fact impossible.         (The scale divisions are 40 to the inch, and
 the scale is about 40 inches from the galvanometer.)
      Now the electromotive-force in the circuit of the galvanometer
when there is no current through the standard coil is due to three
causes: —
      1. The cutting of the earth's flux of induction by the radius of
the rotating disc.        Tho olectromotive-forco duo to this cause is small
in my apparatus, owing to the fact that tho piano of my disc nearly
coincides with the magnetic meridian. For a uniform rate of rotation
it is   constant.
      2.   The thermo-electric forces due to the general distribution of
temperature in the galvanometer circuit. Changes in this distribution
would be gradual, and would not account for the sudden irregular
movements of the galvanometer noodle.
      8. The thermo-electric force at the contact of the external brush
with the circumference of the disc. The sudden movements of the
needle were obviously due to variations in this thermo-electric force.
      I   made many experiments               with a view of diminishing these
changes.        I first tried an ordinary phosphor-bronze brush made of a
    Vol. XIV.          (No. 89.)                                              2 T

number of layers of thin sheet and controlled by a spring, brush and
disc circumference being well amalgamated.         This was not at all
successful.  Trials were then made with amalgamated copper and
amalgamated lead, and with the substitution of a dead-weight pressure
for a spring. But no satisfactory result could be obtained.
     It was noticed, however, that after amalgamation the readings
were fairly steady for a short interval, and it seemed likely that if
mercury could be continuously supplied to the surface of contact

a brush consisting of a single wire, perforated by a channel through
which a constant flow of mercury might be maintained from a cistern
of adjustable height, and a brush of this description was made (Fig. 5).
Trial showed that our difficulty was at an end. The variations almost
disappeared, the sudden jumps quite ceased to trouble us, and the
motion of the needle did not extend over more than one or two
divisions of the scale for many minutes.       A multiplication of such
brushes round tho circumference would make still further improve

 1895.]      on the Absolute Measurement                     of Electrical Resistance.        615
     In   measuring a resistance we have to determine what            have               I
 called the equilibrium rate of rotation corresponding to that resist
 ance, i. e. the rate of rotation such that, on reversing the direction of
 the current through coil and resistance by the commutator, the
 reading of the galvanometer is unchanged.
     Now, it is not very easy to hit this exactly without making a
 great many trials, and, fortunately, it is not necessary for us to do so.
 The current produced in the galvanometer circuit by the difference
 of the electromotive-forces at the disc and at the resistance is pro
 portional to that difference, and, if the current is small, it is propor
 tional to the scale deflection on reversal.       We shall commit no
appreciable error, therefore, if we are near the equilibrium rate, in
assuming that the difference between the equilibrium rate and the
actual rate is proportional to the scale deflection on reversal, or,
what comes to the same thing, that the difference R — M n is pro
portional to the scale deflection on reversal.
    If we take four or five rates of rotation near the equilibrium rate,
and determine t jo deflections on reversal corresponding to each, we
can by interpolation determine the rate of rotation that would cor
respond to no deflection, i. e. the equilibrium rate. If, say, we take
five such rates, some on one side and some on the other of the
equilibrium rate, we get five equations as follows : —

    If the      greatest accuracy          is   not required,        we may content ourselves

    These results show that no single observation differs from the
mean of a number by more than one part in ten thousand.
    We have now to consider the other factor in the resistance — the
coefficient of mutual induction of the coil and disc.                 This depends
merely on the dimensions of the coil and disc if they are accurately
centred, and as the adjustment for centre was made in between the
successive sets given in the last table, we may take for granted that
it can be made with the requisite accuracy.
    The circumference of the disc is a sufficiently true circle, the disc
having been ground true in place. Disc and axle were then removed
and transferred to my Whitworth measuring machine.                    The measure
ment of the disc's diameter presented no difficulty.                  It was easily
determined to the ten-thousandth of an inch. The mean radius of
my coil cannot be determined with the same accuracy, but                    I  believe
it is known to the thousandth of an inch. The coil consists of a
single layer of silk-covered wire wound in a screw thread cut in a
brass frame.        The silk covering of the wire introduces some un
certainty.      It was measured bolted to its stand as in use. Measure

     A more solid metal frame might, no doubt, be turned true to the
accuracy required, and       so turned might then be measured with the

     A still further improvement may be made by making the coil
frame of insulating material, say paraffined marble, and winding on
it naked wire instead of silk-covered wire.        The radius might then
be measured with certainty to something much better than            part in     1
 10,000.    The use of a coil with      single layer of wire instead of
                                                 a
many layers greatly facilitates the determination of the mean radius.
It, of course, necessitated the finding of          new formula for the

coefficient  of mutual induction.
     This  I  obtained by direct integration of the general integral for
the case in point, viz.     circle and coaxial helix.

unknown possible changes in the coil, the resistance of which is now
the legal unit.
    Such a step would have collateral advantages. It would enable the
Board of Trade to certify standards of low electrical resistance. With
such a machine standards of from a thousandth to a two-hundred-
thousandth of an ohm may be measured to nearly the same percentage
accuracy.     All we have to do in dealing with the very low resistances
is to pass a sufficiently large current through them, and shunt the
standard coil of the machine.        But to enter into details on this
point   would   lead me  too far.   I   must content myself with saying
that  I  believe such a    machine    is much the best instrument for
standardising low electrical resistances, and that accurate standards
of low resistance would be of great service both in the laboratory
and the workshop.

               The Radiant Heat from the Moon during the
                         Progress of an Eclipse.
Some  twenty-two years ago (May 30, 1873)      I delivered in this room a
lecture, the title of which was ' On the Radiation of Heat from the
Moon, the Law of its Absorption by our Atmosphere, and its Variation
in amount with her Phases.'

    I then  showed that   I had been able, with the aid of a mirror of
3 feet aperture, not only to detect with certainty the heat radiated
from the lunar surface, but also to estimate with tolerable accuracy
the changes of its amount through the greater part of the lunar
month, to ascertain roughly the average quality of her rays as regards
refractive index, and to compare their amount at the time of Full
Moon with those of the Sun.

     I also showed that we had been able by means of a long series
of determinations,   continued on different nights, through considerable
increases and decreases of altitude, to determine with considerable
accuracy what may be called the extinction curve for heat with
decreasing altitude ; probably as completely as Seidel, at Munich,
had deduced that for light from his photometrical observations on
stars.

approaching New Moon, it was clear that little or none of the heat

we were measuring came from the interior of the Moon.        It was heat
derived directly from the Sun.
     Somo scries of determinations were then made alternately with
a sheet of glass interposed between tho largo speculum (of the
telescope) and the apparatus and with the glass removed, and from
the fact that from 8 to 17 per cent, of the heat (being greatest towards
Full Moon) was transmitted by the glass, while some 90 per cent, of
the sun's rays passed through tho samo sheet of glass, it was, we
think, clearly established that the heat, which we had already con
cluded, as stated above, to be directly derived from the Sun was not
reflected sun-heat, but heat absorbed and afterwards emitted by the
lunar surface.

a very much longer time is required before the air temperature, and with it more
or less that of the earth's surface, arrives at the final temperature due to the sun's

three weeks later respectively than the summer and winter solstices, and U>
hottest time of the day is generally about two hours after noon. Again, the fall

      It then occurred to us that, though this real absorption of heat
takes place so quickly that no appreciable time occurs between its
reception and emission when observed through the comparatively
slow changes of its incidence in the course of the lunar month, surely
with the far more rapid changes of illumination during an eclipse—
some three or four hundred times as rapid — the delay in the emission
might be easily perceived.
      Accordingly we have been on the watch for every lunar eclipse.
      Such events are not very frequent, and of such as occur some are
unsuitable for observation owing to the Moon's low altitude (or to her
being below the horizon during the whole or part of their duration),
while of the remainder most are more or less useless for our purpose
owing to the uncertainties of our climate.

lecture  :         eclipse was a very partial one, only about ^ of the
Moon's diameter being in shadow ; but although this circumstance,
coupled with the uncertain state of the sky, rendered the observation
less satisfactory than it would otherwise have been, yet it was suffi
cient to show that the decline of light and heat as the penumbra came
over the lunar surface, and their increase after the middle of the
eclipse, were sensibly proportional."             This eclipse occurred on
November 14, 1872. On May 22, 1872, clouds had prevented obser
vations during the whole progress of the eclipse.

eclipse were made. Clouds again interfered, and the observations
were very unsatisfactory, but after considerable delay they were

dicker, had the good fortune to get a far more satisfactory series of de
terminations than any previously obtained.               The observations were

obtained through a moderately dense covering of clouds, and being
 therefore of no value for our purpose, have been omitted from the
slide (6). It will be seen that the heat (observed) varies pretty
 nearly as the light (calculated), a slight delay or lag being apparent
in [the heat ; but the most remarkable fact that came out was that the
heat rapidly increased after the termination of the total phase, not
 towards its usual value for Full Moon, but towards a value some
 87 per cent. only of that amount, and though the observations were
continued half an hour after the last contact with the penumbra, there
appeared no disposition to a return to the standard Full Moon value.
 This value was deduced from observations on October 3, 5, 6, and
 November 2, 28, 30.

     During the period of totality the observations were not reliable
owing to the feebleness of the Moon's image, which made it uncertain
whether or not it was properly upon the apparatus ; but those made
just before and just after totality indicate very little radiant heat.
     The next opportunity — an exceptionally favourable one — occurred
on January 28, 1888.*         The sky was not obscured at all during the
whole progress of the eclipse, and the same apparent anomaly of the
heat not returning to its standard value, even as long as 1 hr. 40 min.
after the last contact with the penumbra was observed. But in
addition it was found that the radiation, which we began to measure
1 hr. 5 min. before the first contact with the penumbra, seemed to
begin to decrease almost immediately, so that when the time of
" First contact with the penumbra " had arrived, the heat had been
       <U+2666>

contact with the penumbra the heat was 80*6 only, and 1 hr. 40 min.
later, 81 per cent. only of its full value.   Thus the result arrived at
in 1884 for the second period of the eclipse was fully confirmed.

the progress of this eclipse.

     In 1884 the Moon rose eclipsed, and clouds interfered until
 23 minutes before the total phase. This time good observations from
 over an hour before the first contact with the penumbra were possible.
 Thus the values after the eclipse could be compared with those before
 the eclipse on the same night.

     So far as could be perceived, the sky was cloudless and unchanged
 through the whole period of the observations.      It will be observed
 that the heat declined to less than 1 per cent. during totality. Why
 did it not rise equally after the eclipse ? Can it be that at the lower
 temperature of the eclipsed lunar surface the residual surface-heat
  was less capable of penetrating the Earth's atmosphere ? Can it be

 that the difference — some 300° F. — between the lunar temperature
 when illuminated and when dark causes a sufficient difference in the

 that this is a sufficient explanation.

  Academy of Sciences.'
       In 1883 Langley commenced his experiments on the relative per
  centage of the Sun's heat and the Moon's heat transmitted by glass,
  obtaining not widely differing numbers for each with the interposed
  glass near to the face of the bolometer ; but subsequently, with the
  glass removed to a greater distance, his results approximated to mine,
  75 per cent. being the value found for sunlight, and 12 to 14 percent.
  for moonlight with the same sample of glass.
      Langley, as far as he was able, observed the eclipse of October 4,
  1884, and ho says the eclipsed Moon rose behind clouds, and
  there was still haze as the penumbra passed off. " The inference from
  the observations, so far as any could be drawn, was that about the
  same amount of heat was received as was to be expected had there
  been no previous eclipse."
      He remarks of the Birr Castle observations during this eclipse
                                                              " They
  (before the complete acctunt had been published) :                  appear to
 bear but one interpretation, that all the heat from the Moon disap
 pears immediately that it passes into the Earth's shadow, and there is
 no evidence of any being retained for any sensible time, more than if
 it were reflected."       This we have seen appears to have been very
 nearly, but perhaps not quite the case.
      Langley, in ' Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences,' vol. iii.
 infers : " 1st. That there is a certain presumption that the Earth's
 atmosphere is diathermanous to heat of lower wave length than has
 been heretofore supposed, and of lower wave length than appears to
 reach us from the Sun.
      " 2nd.  If  we may make any inference from comparisons with the
 Leslie cube, the sunlit surface of the Moon is not far from the
 freezing temperature, but not so far below it as we might expect to
 find that of an airless planet.
      " 3rd. So far as our limited observations allow of an
                                                                     inference,
                                                           "
 there is a " not very materially greater coefficient         [query less] " of
 transmission for lunar than for solar."
      The second of these inferences he makes from the distribution of
 heat in the lunar spectrum, a very difficult thing to measure satis
 factorily.    This he admits, and says that the work has been one of
 great labour, but justified by its having been given to a question of
 abstract interest, but one " to which the whole subjects of terrestrial
radiation and the conditions of organic life upon our planet are inti
 mately related."
      Remarks of a similar character may be made with regard to the
results of the eclipse observations.          What limits the extent of our
atmosphere?        Is  it boundless  ?   Does  it always follow Boyle's Law,
or where     does it  depart  from  it ?  These   may be questions of interest
to physicists.       The observations before the commencement of the
Eclipse of 1888 seem, therefore, so far as they go, to be of extreme
importance.      It is certainly unsatisfactory, and perhaps it may be pre

mature to put them forward when still unconfirmed.                     My excuse
must be that I have waited in vain for more than seven years for an
opportunity to test their accuracy and reliability.
     Commenting on our results on heat through glass, Langley says
that " The low transmissibility by glass is quite confirmatory of the
results of Lord Rosse, though not necessarily of his inferences from
them," and he goes on to say that it may be partly accounted for by
the supposition that the rays which reach us have suffered selective
reflection at the surface of the Moon, and in support of this he quotes
Sir John Herschel. " From the fact," he says, " that the lunar light
is not white like the Sun's, but yellowish (Sir J. Herschel compares
the Moon's surface to that of sandstone rock), it was antecedently
probable that such was the case."           Langley, however, seems to have
mistaken the meaning of Horschel's remark.                He says,* " Nor let it
be thought surprising that a solid substance thus illuminated should
appear to shine and again illuminate the Earth.               It is no more than
a white cloud does, standing off upon the clear blue sky. By day the
Moon can hardly be distinguished in brightness from such a cloud,
and in the dusk of the evening appears with a dazzling splendour, not
inferior to the seeming brightness of the Moon at night." And in a
note he remarks, " The actual illumination of the lunar surface is not
much superior to that of weathered sandstone rock in full sunshine.
I  have frequently compared the Moon setting behind the gray per
pendicular facade of the Table Mountain, illuminated by the Sun just
risen in the opposite quarter of the horizon, when it has scarcely
been distinguishable in brightness [the italics in both cases are mine]
from the rock in contact with it." His remarks, therefore, appear to
refer to brightness rather than to colour.
     Langley, however, with the aid of prisms and lenses of rock salt,
obtained an absorption heat spectrum for the lunar rays, but such an
investigation is far beyond what we were able to attempt.                     I  am
not quite clear at present, whether any bands of absorption were
detected in the heat spectrum of the Moon which do not equally
exist in that of the Sun.
     I  still think that our inference is pretty nearly the correct one,
that the radiant heat from the Moon may be treated as consisting of
two portions — one, of the reflected rays of various refrangibilities in
about the same proportions as they exist in the direct radiation from
the Sun, the other of rays absorbed and subsequently emitted by the
lunar surface, and containing the rays of various refrangibilities in
the proportions due to a body at the surface temperature of the Moon.
Langley more recently inclined much to this opinion, and in a letter
                                                              "

reflection." It is much to be regretted that at the death of Mr. Thaw,
a citizen of Pittsburg, the funds which he had furnished to Professor
Langley for these special researches ceased. Professor Langley was
soon after appointed secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, and

 taking as his model the galvanometer of D'Arsouval. In this, instead

of a fixed coil carrying the current to be measured, causing the motion
of a magnetic needle delicately suspended within it, there is            a fixed
horseshoe magnet, between whose poles is suspended a coil which the
current enters from, say above, and leaves below, through two fine
wires, which hold it in position. To this instrument there is the
drawback that the wires from tie coil must be small, otherwise they
would impede its movements.         Hence it is unfitted for the measure
ments of currents of low tension like those coming from the thermo
couple.
    Mercury contacts, owing to capillary forces and an incipient
coating of oxide, give endless trouble. Mr. Boys has modified the
instrument by rigidly connecting the thermocouple with the coil, or
the single circuit which replaces the coil.          Thus a far more sensitive
arrangement than mine (some 6000 times he states) has become pos
sible ; but it has the disadvantage that it cannot be fitted to the
ordinary telescope, as it must never change its position, and hence a
siderostat — a not very simple thing to provide when we work with
large apertures — is essential.     I have a radiomicrometer,        but 1 have
not as yet found an opportunity for the construction of the required
siderostat.*
     Slide 16 gives f Mr. Boys' curve for the deviation as the Moon's
image slowly passes by diurnal motion over the instrument, thus
showing approximately the distribution of the radiation from the
lunar disc. Owing to the very small mass of metal to be heated,

and the absence of swing, or the " dead beat                 of the needle, this
method of observation has become possible.               With our arrangement
the comparative slowness of the needle in coming to rest has entirely
prevented this method of observation.

     It may be asked —can heat experiments be extended to other
Heavenly Bodies ? The step is a long one. The relative proportions
of light coming to us have been estimated as below —

or,  if wo assume the Moon's heat-radiation as compared with her
light to be eight times as great as that of the Sun, or a star. the
proportion between the heat-radiations of the Moon and of Sirius is
100,000.    Much greater sensitiveness is therefore needed. It will
be quite possible,    I   believe, even with the present thermopile and
galvanometer    to measure       the radiation from the various parts of the

some sixty times, but it will be at the same time possible to screen off
extraneous disturbances of the needle better.
     I think that the comparison of the heat through glass with the
total heat is of sufficient importance for repetition with greater care,
and that of the Sun's heat with the Moon's heat should be gone over
again, as also that of the Sun's light with the Moon's light, when we
find so large disagreements between the various figures hitherto

Again, one would like to see Langley's experiments on the solar and
lunar heat spectrum repeated.
     We want, however, more workers.             If  preparations for heat
observations during eclipses were made at several stations, widely
apart, and as much as possible in less cloudy climates, over the
surface of the earth, we should in a comparatively short time clear up
doubtful points to an extent for which a lifetime of our work would
be inadequate, and if this lecture should conduce to this end        I shall
feel, if for no other reason, that my trouble will have been fully
rewarded.

Prof. Alfred Cornu, D.C.L. F.R.S. Officier           de la Légion d'Honneur,
   Vice- President   de  l'Académie    des Sciences, Paris, Hon. M.R.I. etc.
         Phénomènes Physiques des Hautes Régions de l'Atmosphère.
La     cause    premièro et décisive de presque tous les phénomènes
physiques ayant         pour siège l'atmosphère terrestre est la chaleur
solaire.     L'atmosphère peut donc être considérée comme une immense
machine thermique dont le foyer est le soleil ; la chaudière est
figurée par le sol, ou les nuages échauffés par ses rayons, et le con
denseur par le rayonnement vers l'espace interplanétaire.
      Les moyens dont disposent les physiciens et les météorologistes
pour étudier les diverses régions de l'atmosphère sont très limités :
ils sont obligés de se contenter le plus souvent d'observations très
indirectes et de procéder par induction. En effet, les phénomènes
les plus intéressants se passent dans les hautes régions, c'est à dire à
des hauteurs presque inaccessibles.            Le but de cette lecture est de
vous montrer par quelques expériences que les physiciens météoro
logistes commencent à s'approcher beaucoup de l'explication véritable
des phénomènes naturels.            Vous verrez, en effet, que, dans certains
cas, on arrive non seulement à obtenir une image exacte de ces phéno
mènes, mais souvent à en produire une véritable synthèse par l'emploi
de procédés tout à fait analogues à ceux qui fonctionnent réellement
dans la nature.
      Je commencerai par énumérer les moyens en usage parmi les
 météorologistes pour étudier les différentes régions de l'atmosphère.
      La méthode la plus directo repose sur l'emploi de l'aérostat :
 l'aérostat ou ballon permet effectivement de porter les instruments
 de mesure au sein même des couches atmosphériques qu'on veut
 étudier.      Malheureusement      le moyen est difficile, coûteux, et même
 dangereux ; il n'est donc employé que d'une manière exceptionnelle.
 Les ascensions aérostatique* les plus fructueuses ont été celles de
 Gay-Lussac (1804), de Glaisher (1862) et récemment du Dr. Berson,
 de Stassfurt (1894), qui s'est élevé à plus de 9000 mètres.
      Les faits les plus importants observés en ballon étaient fort inat
 tendus ; en voici le résumé.
       1°. Il  existe très fréquemment des nuages formés de cristaux de
 >jlace : ils constituent     les cirrus qui flottent à des hauteurs très
 grandes    ;

1895.J Phénomènes Physiques             des Hautes Régions de l'Atmosphère. 639
      2°.  La direction des vents change a diverses hauteurs ;
     3°.   La température ne diminue pas toujours régulièrement avec
l'altitude : on rencontre souvent des couches froides et des couches
chaudes alternativement.
      La seconde méthode directe pour étudier l'atmosphère est la
création des observatoires de montagne, autant que possible sur des
pics isolés.     Dans ces observatoires on vérifie journellement la réalité
de ces inversions si imprévues des vents et de la température a diverses
altitudes.
      Quant aux nuages de glace, ils sont trop élevés pour être atteints
directement par les observatoires de montagne.
      11 sera probablement       intéressant pour vous de connaître les prin
cipaux observatoires de montagne créés en France.

      Halos.  — Nous     avons       dit que les observatoires        de  montagno
n'atteignent pas la région des nuages glacés (6000 à 10,000 mètres
d'altitude) : on serait donc condamné à ne jamais les observer qu'en
ballon. Heureusement ces cristaux de glace se révèlent par un
phénomène optique qu'on aperçoit même du niveau du sol, le Halo.
C'est un cercle brillant de 22° environ de rayon, qui entoure le
soleil ou la lune ; il présente une teinte rougeâtre à l'intérieur et
légèrement bleuâtre à l'extérieur. On l'explique, ainsi que beaucoup
d'apparences du même genre, par la réfraction de la lumière de l'astre
à travers les aiguilles glacées : en effet, les cristaux de glace sont des
prismes hexagonaux dont les faces sont de deux en deux inclinées de
 60°.     Ces cristaux, disséminés dans l'air et orientes dans toutes les
directions, réfractent la lumière, mais les rayons réfractés ne peuvent
dépasser l'oblique de 22° que leur impose le minimum de déviation
découvert par Sir Isaac Newton : la limite des rayons réfractés est
donc un cône de 22° autour de la ligne qui va de l'œil à l'astre.
     Expérience imitant le halo. — On fait naître des cristaux dans un milieu
 transparent constitué îar un mélange de liquides appropriés; on reproduit
 ainsi exactement le mélange des couches chaudes et humides do l'atmosphère
 avec les couches froides qui font naître les cristaux de glace.
     À cet effet on place dans une cuve de verre une solution aqueuse saturée
 d'alun de potasse, et à travers cette cuve on fait passer un faisceau lumineux
 projetant l'image d'une ouverture circulaire figurant le soleil sur un ciel
 obscur.    Puis on ajoute un quart du volume total d'alcool rectifié; l'alun,
 insoluble dans l'eau alcoolisée, le précipite en cristaux très petits qui tlottent

au sein du liquide.      L'image du soleil se trouble d'abord comme dans un
brouillard, mais bientôt un cercle brillant et légèrement irisé se dessine et figure
très exactement l'apparence du halo: l'expérience est brillante et instructive.
      Ce phénomène est bien connu des gons de la campagne : c'est un
signe certain de pluie lorsqu'il apparaît pendant une journée chaude,
même lorsqu'aucun autre indice ne fait prévoir de perturbation mété
orologique.
      Alternance et inversion des températures. — Dans les observatoires
voisins situés à des altitudes très différentes, comme celui du Puy-de-
Dôme et celui de Clermont, on constate très souvent l'existence de
courants chauds dans les régions supérieures.            C'est à des inversions
successives de même nature que Mr. Amsler de Schaffouse attribue ce
beau phénomène connu en Suisse sous le nom &' Alpengliïhen et qui
consiste dans une nouvelle illumination des sommets neigeux des
Alpes plusieurs minutes après que le coucher du soleil les a rendus
obscurs.
     Projection d'une photographie des sommets de l'Oberland bernois, la
Jungfrau, le Mônch, l'Eijier; la vue étant prise de St. Beatenberg, près du
lac de Thoune.      Imitation pittoresque du phénomène par un verre coloré et
des diaphragmes    convenables.
      L'explication de Mr. Amsler est fondée sur le changement du sens
 de la courbure de la trajectoire des rayons lumineux suivant que l'air
 du fond des vallées est plus chaud ou plus froid que celui des régions
élevées.
      Avant le coucher du soleil, le sol échauffé par la chaleur solaire,
 imprime à la trajectoire une courbure analogue à celle du mirage
 S A MB,
  c'est à dire, convexe vers la terre; le soleil en s'abaissant en S' fait
  que l'ombre du sommet A se projette sur le sommet B qui devrait
  désormais rester dans l'ombre puisque le soleil continue à s'abaisser
  et que le dernier rayon est S' A M' fi'. Mais si dans l'intervalle l'air
  de la valléo se refroidit suffisamment, la trajectoire prend une courbure
  inverse S" A M" B" et le sommet B se trouve de nouveau illuminé.

     On voit par ces quelques          exemples que l'étude des phénomènes
optiques de l'atmosphère, aidée par l'analyse et la synthèse physiques,
peut et doit apprendre beaucoup sur les phénomènes calorifiques dus
régions inaccessibles.
     Phénomènes dynamiques de l'atmosphère. — Les phénomènes étudiés
jusqu'ici sont dûs à des états d'équilibre presque complets dans les
couches atmosphériques:          on pourrait les appeler statiques.        Mais
l'action calorifique du soleil, combinée à l'action refroidissante du
 rayonnement dans l'espace, peut produire des phénomènes de mouve
 ment présentant tous les degrés d'intensité depuis les plus faibles
jusqu'aux plus violents : nous les appellerons phénomènes dynamiques.
      Ils se manifestent sous des formes très diverses :
      1°. Sous forme d'énergie mécanique : vents, tourbillons, cyclones,
 trombes, etc. ;
      2°. Sous forme d'énergie calorifique qui se traduit par la formation
 des nuages, de la pluie, de la grêle, correspondant à des changements
 d'état de l'eau, l'élément continuellement variable de l'atmosphère.
      3". bous forme d'énergie électrique : éclairs, tonnerre, etc.
      En fait, c'est la transformation de l'énergie solaire en énergie
 mécanique qui est le phénomène fondamental ; il entraîne tous les
 autres.    C'est la seule transformation que, pour abréger, je con
 sidérerai ici.
      Le phénomène mécanique le plus simple qui se produit dans
 l'atmosphère est le vent.        Le vent a pour origine une différence do
 pression entre deux points plus ou moins éloignés : on sait depuis
 Pascal que la pression de l'air est mesurée par le baromètre.              On
 pourrait donc penser, d'après cette propriété, que la direction du vent
 est toujours déterminée par les indications de cet instrument ; c'est
 à dire que lo vent doit aller du point où la pression barométrique
 est la plus forte au point où la pression barométrique est la plus
 faible.
      Eh bien ! il n'en est presque jamais ainsi : la direction réelle du
 vent est toujours oblique sur cette direction théorique ! Ce fait est
 connu     seulement depuis        très peu d'années ; ce sont les cartes
 météorologiques générales — imaginées il y a trentu ans par Le Verrier
 — si répandues aujourd'hui, qui ont mis ce fait hors de doute.

1895.] Phénomènes Physiques des Hautes Régions de V Atmosphère. 648
      La direction du vent semble tourner autour du point de la carte
où se trouve la pression minimum en sens inverse des aiguilles d'une
montre ; ou bien dans le sens direct autour du point de pression
maximum. Tel est le sons du phénomène dans l'hémisphère boréal : c'est
l'inverse dans l'hémisphère austral.      En un mot, le mouvement le plus
ordinaire de l'atmosphère est un mouvement gyratoire, ce qu'on nomme
un tourbillon.
      11 y a longtemps que le mouvement tourbillonnaire de l'air a été
aperçu : nous le voyons se produire bien souvent autour de nous ; la
poussière, les feuilles mortes sont soulevées par le vent en tourbillons
semblables aux remous de l'eau dans les rivières.        Les marins connais
sent les cyclones, les trombes, dont ils redoutent les dangereux effets.
Sur le continent américain on observe aussi des ouragans terribles
nommés tornados.         Ces mouvements gyratoires paraissaient ne con
 venir qu'à ces grandes perturbations orageuses ; mais à mesure que
l'on poursuit dans le détail l'étude de l'atmosphère on reconnaît que
ce genre d'ébranlement        se rencontre dans toutes les manifestations
de l'air déplacé.       On en conclut que le mouvement tourbillonnaire
est l'état en quelque sorte normal de l'air agité ; on ne peut guère
exercer d'efforts sur une masse gazeuse sans y développer des rotations
plus ou moins rapides qui tendent à se conserver en régime permanent.
      Preuves expérimentales. — Toutes les fois qu'on produit un jet de
 gaz rapide, il se forme un ou plusieurs tourbillons à côté du jet.
 Le tourbillon prend la forme d'un anneau si la colonne projetée
est bien cylindrique ; témoins les couronnes de fumée qu'on observe
 après l'explosion des canons, des fusils, etc.
      Répétition de l'expérience  bien connu des belles couronnes de fumées
 produites   en frappant le fond en toile d'une caisse remplie de vapeurs de
chlorhydrate d'ammoniaque et offrant une ouverture circulaire à la paroi
opposée : on les rend visibles en les lançant dans l'alignement d'un faisceau
 de lumière électrique.
       Origine   multiple   des  mouvements   gyratoires  de  l'atmosphère. —
 Presque toutes les causes générales qui agissent sur le mouvement de
 l'atmosphère sont des influences gyratoires : une fois le mouvement
 amorcé, il continue de lui-même et va parfois en s' exagérant.            En
 premier lieu on doit citer le mouvement de rotation de la terre qui
 apporte toujours une petite composante de rotation pour un déplace
 ment d'une masse gazeuse en latitude ou en altitude.         En second lieu
 et comme cause décisiye, la chaleur solaire, qui échauffe l'air près
 du sol ou près des nuages: comme la force ascensionnelle du gaz
 échauffé ne peut pas être uniformo sur toute la surface exposée au
  rayonnement du soleil (tant à cause de la nature du sol que de son
  relief), il y a rupture d'équilibre en certains points et des colonnes
  gazeuses tendent à s'élever.      On se trouve ainsi dans le cas des jets
  cités plus haut et par conséquent dans les circonstances favorables
  à des gyrations autour d'axes horizontaux.        Une fois la gyration éta
  blie, les causes qui l'ont déterminées, l'entretiennent et l'augmentent.

     L'existence de tourbillons à axe horizontal dans les orages à grêles
(en particulier dans celui du 20 mai 1893,
                                                  à Pittsburg), a été observée
par un météorologiste américain, Mr. Frank W. Very, et lui a fourni une
très ingénieuse explication de la formation de la grêle.         En effet, un tel
tourbillon, s'il a des dimensions suffisantes, transporto l'air chaud et
humide de la surface du sol dans les régions élevées et froides.              La
vapeur   se  condense,  se  congèle  et les cristaux   de  glace sont entraînés
dans le mouvement gyratoire : ils montent et descendent alternative
ment en suivant les spirales du tourbillon et s'accroissent à chaque
passage dans les régions inférieures chargées d'humidité.                  Cette
explication rend compte de toutes les particularités qu'on observe
dans la chute des grêlons ; structure zônée, température très basse ;
bruit spécial avant la chute ; manifestations électriques qui les
accompagnent, car le tourbillon de grêle est une véritable machine
électrique à influence, une sorte de replenisher.
     Reproduction artificielle des phénomènes gyratoires naturels. — Les
phénomènes produits par la rotation rapide de l'air sont tout à fait
imprévus par la singularité des forces mises enjeu. Les lois ordinaires
de la mécanique auxquelles l'expérience journalière nous a accoutumés,
paraissent entièrement différentes de celles auxquelles semblent obéir
les mouvements tourbillonnaires ; et cela ne doit point nous étonner.
Nous avons réduit la mécanique à ses éléments les plus simples ; le
point matériel, la force constante, le mouvement rectiligne : grâce a
 ces simpli6cations nous avons bien saisi lo mouvement de projectiles
 sphériques, celui d'un pendule, la rotation d'un volant, etc. Mais, dès
que le corps solide devient complexe comme forme, lorsque le mouve
ment qu'il peut prendre comporte à la fois une translation et une
rotation, notre imagination se le représente mal ; si, à cette compli
 cation de forme, se joint la résistance du milieu ambiant, alors nous
 n'avons plus aucune idée de l'effet résultant probable ; témoin le
boumerang. Quant aux mouvements des fluides, ils sont pour nous
 si difficiles à prévoir que nous sommes toujours surpris lorsque
 nous manœuvrons un vase plein d'eau ; dès que la masse de liquide
 est un peu considérable        les mouvements tumultueux que nous y
faisons   naître sans  le  vouloir  nous amènent toujours à faire quelque
maladresse.
      On conçoit alors dans quelle impossibilité nous nous trouvons
 pour prévoir les mouvements de l'atmosphère dont la masse est
 immense, car chaque mètre cube pèse 1300 gr. ; si l'énergie dépensée
 pour mettre en mouvement de pareilles masses est considérable,
 inversement la stabilité du régime est énorme, puisqu'il faut attendre
 la dissipation de cette énergie par les résistances passives, presque
 toujours réduites aux frottements sur la surface terrestre.
     Nous ne chercherons donc pas à analyser les forces mises en jeu
 dans les mouvements gyratoires de l'air ; je me bornerai à répéter
 devant vous quelques-unes des belles expériences de M. Ch. Weyher,
 lequel a bien voulu venir lui-même me prêter son concours et disposer
 les appareils placés en ce moment sous vos yeux.

    Voici une sphère composée de dix palettes circulaires, mise en
rotation rapide autour de l'axe A B (Fig. 4) : l'air entraîné dans la
rotation produit un mouvement tourbillonnaire général, symétrique
par rapport au plan de l'équateur.       Do tous les côtés l'air est aspiré
par la sphère tournante ainsi qu'on en peut juger par les fumées ou
les fragments de papier qu'on en approche.           Cet air est expulsé
sur la circonférence équatoriale et seulement dans le plan presque
mathématique de cette circonférence ; voyez, en effet, ces couronnes
de papier qui se maintiennent concentriquement        à l'équateur snivant
                                  Kig.  4.
une disposition qai rappelle l'anneau de Saturne : la tension du
papier et son frémissement montrent bien que c'est la répulsion par
le souffle equatorial qui les maintient.
     On pourrait croire dès lors que cette sphère tournante ne peut
produire que des répulsions équatoriales ; mais la complexité des filets
tourbillonnaires déjoue les prévisions les plus évidentes. Approchons
un léger ballon à une petite distance de la sphère, il est vivement
attiré et se mit à tourner avec rapidité autour de la sphère motrice
dans le plan equatorial : un secoud, un troisième lancés de la même

             ;
    Ce paradoxe d'une répulsion transformée en attraction par le
changement de forme du corps présenté, se résout aisément en con
sidérant la résultante des actions aspirantes et répulsives sur la
surface du mobile.       Sur la plus grande étendue angulaire autour
de la sphère tournante c'est l'attraction tourbillonnaire qui domine.
On le prouve aisément en plaçant au-dessous de cette sphère un bassin
plein d'eau chaude ; si l'air de la salle est bien calme on voit peu à
                                     peu la vapeur s'agréger en un filet
                                     tourbillonnant depuis la surface de

les unes en montant, les autres en descendant : c'est un va et vient
perpétuel entre le moulinet supérieur et la surface de l'eau.       Comme
tontes les veines tournent. dans un même sens, si celles qui montent
décrivent des hélices à droite, celles qui descendent décrivent des
hélices à gauche.     C'est faute d'avoir reconnu ce double mouvement
d'ascension et de descente que s'éternise le malentendu entre les par
tisans des trombes ascendantes et ceux qui soutiennent qu'elles sont
 seulement descendantes.
     Le mouvement ascensionnel des ballons légers entraînés par la
trombe montre bien les vitesses ascendantes ; il est plus difficile de
mettre en évidence la région descendante, invoquée dans certaines
théories commo existant exclusivement, parce qu'elle occupe dans
l'expérience réduite un espace très petit ; elle est confinée dans l'in
térieur même do la gaine nébuleuse, qui par sa couleur sombre en
dessine le vide central : je vais pourtant vous la montrer à l'aide d'un
artifice très simple. Portons au haut de la trombe un corps émet
 tant de la fumée ; nous voyons aussitôt cette fumée aspirée, gagner
l'intérieur de la gaine, s'enrouler en un cône effilé et descendre vers la
surface de l'eau. C'est exactement ce qu'on voit dans la nature lorsque,
dans une trombe marine, les nnages descendent sous forme d'un
fuseau qui vient se greffer au centre du buisson formé par l'eau à la
 surface de la mer bouillonnante. Ce fuseau, c'est la partie pour ainsi
dire inoffensive de la trombe ; la partie terrible est invisible, elle est
 formée par la gaine d'air qui tourbillonne autour de ce fuseau. Dans
l'expérience mise sous vos yeux c'est l'inverse ; la gaine tourbillonnaire
 est bien visible grâce à la vapeur qu'on lui fournit, le fuseau in
térieur reste sombre ; c'est par l'introduction de la fumée qu'on en
vérifie l'existence et la forme.
      Il resterait à vous montrer qu'on peut avec un dispositif analogue,
 reproduire un cyclone avec touteb ses particularités; variations de
 pression    au passage du météore, minimum barométrique,             calme
 central, brusque saute de vent, oeil de la tempête, etc., c'est ce que
 réalise aussi M. Weyher.      Mais le temps nous manque ; les experi
 ences que vous venez de voir suffiront, je l'espère, à vous montrer com
 bien ces synthèses expérimentales sont complètes et comment elles
 reproduisent dans les moindres détails les phénomènes naturels.
      Je conclurai en vous faisant simplement remarquer combien la

                             Boiling Liquid Air.
                                  [Abstract.]
Continued investigation of the properties of matter at extremely low
 temperatures has resulted in a considerable addition to our knowledge
on this subject, more especially in regard to phosphorescence and
photographic action.       Phosphorescence      and fluorescence are terms
applied to similar phenomena which apparently differ only in degree,
the first being practically an instantaneous effect, while the other
lasts for a relatively long period after the withdrawal of the light
stimulus. In all cases the luminous effects called phosphorescence
and fluorescence belong to a less refrangible part of the spectrum
than the exciting rays.     Professor Stokes has shown that the singular
surface appearance observed in fluorescent liquids is due to a change of
 refrangibility of the light absorbed, and again given off by their
upper layers.       Phosphorescence     may be regarded as a kind of
fluorescence which lasts a long time after the excitation has ceased,
and may be briefly defined as the phenomena observed when certain
substances give out light through the transformation of absorbed
vibrations of shorter period.      This must not be confused with the
luminosity    due  to the slow   oxidation   of phosphorus ; nor with the
" phosphorescent " appearance accompanying the slow combustion of
decaying animal and vegetable matter; nor with the more or less
voluntary display of light by fireflies, glow-worms and small marine
animals.     The researches of Becquerel showed that the intensity of
phosphorescence depended directly on the product of the intensity of
the stimulating light, and a factor of absorption, and inversely, as
some coefficient representing molecular friction or damping.         When
phosphorescing sulphides of calcium are heated they increase in their
light emission, whereas if cooled to     — 80° they cease altogether  to be
luminous, and if maintained at this low temperature for hours, keep a
latent store of light energy that may be again evolved on allowing the
sulphide to rise to the ordinary temperature.
     But while the temperature of— 80° is sufficient to stop all sensible
emission from proviously-excited sulphide, it does not prevent an

unexcitcd sulphide from " absorbing       light energy that can be evolved
at higher temperature.      By means of liquid air we can now cool
substances to temperatures ranging from — 180° to — 200°.           Under
such conditions all known organic compounds are solids, and this
condition of matter is specially favourable to phosphorescent phe
nomena.     Moreover, the list of truly phosphorescent bodies has been
greatly extended, and knowledge of their peculiarities in this direction
increased.
     The effect of temperature on phosphorescence is easy to observe
by taking two portions of the same substance placed in similar very
thin test tubes, cooling one of the specimens in liquid air, and then
quickly exposing both samples side by side to the same light stimu
lation. The form of apparatus used is shown in Fig. 1. A is a
powerful electric lamp in a lantern, the latter carrying a fitting
whereby the light is screened from the eye of the observer.           E is
                                                         \    \\      \

a double vacuum vessel containing liquid air or oxygen.                The
 substance to be examined is plunged below the surface of the liquid
 air, as at F. When it is thoroughly cooled, it is withdrawn from
the liquid and exposed for a few seconds to the full light of the arc
 in the horizontal part of the tube. It is then quickly withdrawn
 and examined for phosphorescence in the darkened room. The fitting
 B is another modification of the apparatus for experimental purposes,
 and consists of a slit and suitable lens and prism, whereby the
 spectrum can be thrown on to a table, as at D C, and cooled bodies
 examined in various parts of the spectrum.          If, during the light
 excitation caused by burning magnesium or a flash of the electric
 light, the eyes are carefully covered, then the comparative phos
 phorescence, if any, of the cooled and uncooled substance can be
 observed.   In this mode of working the action of the very short
 wave-lengths   of light are stopped by the opacity of glass, but
 the solid condition of all substances at the low temperature enables

  1895.]         Phosphorescence and Photographic     Action,              667
  the use  of glass to be abandoned when necessary.            As  a general
 rule it may be stated that the great majority of substances ex
 hibiting feeble phosphorescence at ordinary temperature, become
 markedly more active at these very low temperatures.          Thus gelatin,
 celluloid, paraffine, ivory, horn, and india-rubber become distinctly
 luminous, with a bluish or greenish phosphorescence, after cooling
 to — 180° and being stimulated by the electric light.        Hydroquinone
 was more luminous than the isomeric resorciuol or pyrooatechol, and
 in the same way pyrogallol was faint compared with phloroglucol.
 All alkaloids forming fluorescent solutions become phosphorescent
 at low temperatures.     The hydrocarbons, alcohols, acids and ethers
 of the fatty series are all more or less active, and glycerin, sulphuric
 and nitric acids are all very bright, so also are concentrated hydro-
 chlorio acid and strong ammonia solution. Coloured salts generally
 show little activity, but a large number of colourless salts are very
 luminous.     Water when pure is only feebly phosphorescent, but
 remarkably so when impure.       Acetic acid and acetamide appeared
 fairly equal in luminosity ; hippuric acid was very fine, as were most
 substances containing a ketone group.           Lithium platinocyanide
 changed from white to red on cooling, and was excelled in phos
 phorescing power by yellow ammonium platinocyanide, which was
 exceedingly bright.
     Definite organic substances possessing exceptional powers of phos
 phorescence when stimulated at — 180° C, are acetophenone, benzo-
 phenone, asparagin, hippuric acid, phthalic anhydride, urea, creatine,
 urethane, succinimide, triphenyl methane, diphenyl, salicylic acid,
 glycogen, aldehyde-ammonia, &c. It will require long and laborious
 experiments, however, to measure the relative brightness of the phos
phorescence of bodies belonging to definite series.
     Remarkable results were obtained with an egg-shell and a feather
respectively. The egg shone brilliantly as a globe of blue light, and
the feather was equally brilliant, its outline showing clearly in tho
darkened room. Other organic substances giving good results wero
cotton-wool, paper, leather, linen, tortoiseshell, and sponge, all phos
phorescing brightly, as did also a white flower, a cultivated species
of Dianthus.    Coloured glasses and papers as a rule exhibit no phos
phorescence, and when the alcohols are coloured by the addition of a
trace of iodine, the luminous effect is destroyed.     Milk was shown to
be highly phosphorescent       and much brighter than water.             Tho
white of egg has greater phosphorescing power than the yolk, white
substances generally being superior in this respect to coloured ones.
On cooling a layer of white of egg on the outside of a test tube to
 — 190°, and then exposing it to a flash of the electric arc, the brilliancy
of the phosphorescent light is very striking. The chloro-, bromo-,
iodo-, sulpho-, and nitro-compounds, as a rule, show nothing, or are but
faintly luminous. Amongst basic bodies nicotine is more luminous
than quinoline or pyridine.      Metals also phosphoresce, but in this
case the action is duo to some organic film deposited from tho air,

668                        Professor D&mar  on                 [Jan. 18,
because it disappears on ignition.      If the metal is subsequently
touched, the phosphorescence re-appears.
    So far as the examination has been carried, the two most remark
able classes of substance for phosphorescence are the platinocyanides
amongst inorganic compounds, and the ketonic compounds, like
acetophenone and ethyl phenyl ketone, and others of the same type,
amongst organic. When ammonium platinocyanido is cooled with
liquid air and maintained at this temperature by being immersed in
the liquid while stimulated by exposure to a beam of the electric arc,
it continues to glow in the dark with a feeble emission as long as
the temperature is kept about — 180°. On pouring off, however, the
liquid air from the crystals so that the temperature may rise, then
the interior of the test tube glows like a lamp from the sudden
increase of light emissivity as the temperature rises.   It seems clear
                   Fig. 2.                     Fig. 3.
from this experiment that similar initial light intensities being used
for stimulating, the substance at this low temperature must have
acquired increased power of absorption, and it may be that at the
same time the factor of molecular friction or damping may have
diminished. That the absorptive power of substances for light is
greatly changed at low temperatures is proved by the change of
colour in substances like oxide, iodide, and sulphide of mercury,
chromic acid, &c, when cooled.        Many quantitative photometric
measurements must be made before the actual changes taking place
in the conditions governing the phenomena can be definitely stated.
    Along with these experiments on phosphorescence, a number of
photographs have been taken at — 180°, using various sensitive
plates and films, and these have been compared with similar photo
graphs taken at the same time under similar conditions at the ordi

nary temperature.      The first plan (Fig. 2) was simply to immerse a
strip of sensitive bromide paper A B, in one of the vacuum vessels
containing liquid oxygen, and when the part immersed had been
thoroughly cooled down, exposing it to the light of a piece of burning
magnesium.     The paper was then developed, when a result some
thing resembling 0 was obtained.        The part which had been cooled
by  the  liquid oxygen,  as at  A,  was  untouched by the light, whereas
the portion of paper above the liquid at B developed up quite black.
Further modifications were made in Fig. 3, where the strip of sensi
tive film E was enclosed in a cover of sheet lead B, having two small
discs cut away as at 0 and D.       The strip was then cooled in liquid
                               4

oxygen A, and then exposed to a flash of burning magnesium.          After
development, the strip appeared something like E, when again the
action of the light was considerably diminished on the part of the
film which had been cooled.         In Fig. 4 a form of apparatus was
adopted whereby    the  exposures  were    made without the disadvantage
of the light passing through the glass sides of the vacuum vessels.
B and E were vacuum vessels enclosed in a blackened box ; into B
a quantity of liquid oxygen was poured.        The sensitive plate or film
was then lowered so as just to touch the surface of the liquid as at
C. D was a comparison plate exposed at the same timj: and at the
samo distanco from the source of light A, only the comparison plate

was taken at ordinary temperature.         By immersing the photographic
plate to different depths in the liquid oxygen or air, the comparative
opacities of the liquids could be observed.       After exposure, the two
plates  were  removed    from   the supports and developed together in the
same solution, when similar results were obtained as in the previous
experiments.      The photographs have been examined by Captain
Abney,   who   reports that the photographic action has been reduced
by 80 per    cent,  at the temperature of — 180°.     If the photographic
action is brought about by a chemical change, then it appears to be
the only one that can be traced under such conditions, as substances
having the most powerful affinities have no action on each other,
and all voltaic combinations        cease to give a current at such low
temperatures.      It is certain that the Eastman film, cooled to —200°
by the evaporation of air in vacuo is still fairly sensitive to photo
graphic action.      Much further work, however, will be required to
reach a definite conclusion as to what is taking place when substances
sensitive to photographic action are subjected to such conditions of
temperature.
